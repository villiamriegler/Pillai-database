EPAR summary for the public 
Onbrez Breezhaler 
indacaterol 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Onbrez Breezhaler. It explains 
how the Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of 
use. It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use Onbrez Breezhaler. 
For practical information about using Onbrez Breezhaler, patients should read the package leaflet or 
contact their doctor or pharmacist. 
What is Onbrez Breezhaler and what is it used for? 
Onbrez Breezhaler is a medicine that is used to keep the airways open in adults with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a long-term disease in which the airways and air sacs 
inside the lungs become damaged or blocked, leading to difficulty breathing. Onbrez Breezhaler is used 
for maintenance (regular) treatment. 
The medicine contains the active substance indacaterol. 
How is Onbrez Breezhaler used? 
Onbrez Breezhaler capsules, which contain a power for inhalation, are only used with a Onbrez 
Breezhaler inhaler and must not be swallowed. To receive a dose, the patient places a capsule into the 
inhaler and breathes the powder in through the mouth. 
The recommended dose is one 150 microgram capsule, once a day at the same time each day. The 
doctor may increase the dose to one 300 microgram capsule once a day in cases of severe COPD.  
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. 
How does Onbrez Breezhaler work? 
The active substance in Onbrez Breezhaler, indacaterol, is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. It 
works by attaching to beta-2 receptors that are found in the muscle cells of many organs and that

cause the muscles to relax. When Onbrez Breezhaler is inhaled, indacaterol reaches the receptors in 
the airways and activates them. This causes the muscles of the airways to relax, helping to keep the 
airways open and allowing the patient to breathe more easily. 
What benefits of Onbrez Breezhaler have been shown in studies? 
In three main studies involving over 4,000 patients with COPD, Onbrez Breezhaler was compared with 
placebo (a dummy treatment), tiotropium or formoterol (other inhaled medicines used to treat COPD). 
The main measure of effectiveness was based on changes in the patients’ forced expiratory volumes 
(FEV1, the maximum volume of air a person can breathe out in one second) after 12 weeks.  
Onbrez Breezhaler was more effective than placebo at improving how well the lungs work in patients 
with COPD. On average, the increase in FEV1 in patients who received Onbrez Breezhaler was between 
150 to 190 ml, while for patients who received placebo the change in FEV1 ranged from a decrease of 
10 ml to an increase of 20 ml. Overall, the effects of the 150 and 300 microgram doses of Onbrez 
Breezhaler were similar, but the results showed that the 300 microgram dose may provide better relief 
in patients with more severe disease. The increase in FEV1 was 130 ml with tiotropium, and 80 ml with 
formoterol. 
What are the risks associated with Onbrez Breezhaler? 
The most common side effects with Onbrez Breezhaler (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
are nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(infection of the nose and throat). Other common side effects include chest pain, cough and muscle 
cramps.  
For the full list of all side effects and restrictions with Onbrez Breezhaler, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Onbrez Breezhaler approved? 
The European Medicines Agency concluded that Onbrez Breezhaler was shown to be effective at 
improving the lung function in COPD. The Agency also noted that there were no major safety concerns 
with Onbrez Breezhaler, with side effects being manageable and similar to other beta-2 adrenergic 
receptor agonist medicines. Therefore, the Agency decided that Onbrez Breezhaler’s benefits are 
greater than its risks and recommended that it be given marketing authorisation. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Onbrez Breezhaler? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Onbrez Breezhaler have been included in the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted on 31 January 2022 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tecvayli, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 29 January 2021. 
Tecvayli, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/20/2331 on 19 October 2020 in the 
following condition: treatment of multiple myeloma. During the procedure the applicant requested the 
withdrawal of Tecvayli from the Community Register of orphan medicinal products. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation and at the time of the review of 
the orphan designation by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), this product was 
withdrawn from the Community Register of designated orphan medicinal products on 19 July 2022 on 
request of the sponsor. The relevant orphan designation withdrawal assessment report can be found 
under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tecvayli.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies including a proteasome 
inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or studies. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision, 
P/0044/2020 on the granting of a product-specific waiver.  
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products.

1.5.  Applicant’s requests for consideration 
1.5.1.  Conditional marketing authorisation  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
1.5.2.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
1.5.3.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance teclistamab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  PRIME 
Teclistamab Janssen-Cilag International was granted eligibility to PRIME on 29 January 2021 in the 
following indication: treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, who 
previously received ≥3 prior lines of therapy.  
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Despite available treatments, there is still a need for new treatment options for relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma patients whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody.  
The non-clinical data provided evidence of biological activity and anti-tumour activity in multiple 
myeloma.  
Preliminary clinical data offers encouraging evidence of a treatment effect in a heavily pre-treated 
population.  
The mechanism of action, even though similar to CAR-T products in the same indication, offers an 
alternative route of activation of T-cells, without the manufacturing and administration 
complications of those products.  
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Johanna Lähteenvuo was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 25 May 2021. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
commercial shelf-life strategy  
changes to the confirmatory study design  
adequacy of the proposed data package, including number of patients treated and amount of 
follow up data expected to be available at the time of the initial MAA  
strategy to demonstrate significant benefit in the context of orphan maintenance

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Teclistamab as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies including a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a rare and incurable plasma cell neoplasm which typically affects adults 
mostly over 60 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is 65–70 years; MM is very rare in patients 
younger than 40 years old (2% of cases). 
MM accounts for 1%-1.8% of all cancers and is the second most common haematological malignancy 
(after non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]) with an estimated incidence in Europe of 4.5-6/100 000/year, 
with approximately 176.404 new MM cases and 117,077 deaths due to MM anticipated in 2020 
worldwide (The Global Cancer Observatory 2020).  
Multiple Myeloma is characterised by the increased proliferation of malignant monoclonal plasma cells 
in the bone marrow, with the subsequent bone marrow failure due to replacement of normal bone 
marrow haematopoiesis, the over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein, either intact 
immunoglobulins and/or free light chains [FLC]) which could be detected in the serum or urine, and 
finally the presence of systemic symptoms named as CRAB (hyperCalcemia, Renal impairment, 
Anaemia and Bone lesions). Increased susceptibility to infections (immunoparesis) and neurological 
complications are also present (Palumbo 2011). 
Based on karyotype, MM is classified as non-hyperdiploid and hyperdiploid, with the latter accounting 
for 50% to 60% of cases and characterizeised by trisomies in odd-numbered chromosomes. MM has a 
heterogeneous progression pathway, with multiple relapses over time, whereby several MM cell 
subclones coexist at baseline and compete for dominance over time, leading to the evolution of drug-
resistance clones [Laubach, 2014].  
Drug resistance to prior regimens in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM is due to continuous 
changes in the disease biology, in which a higher proportion of malignant cells are expressing a more 
aggressive, highly proliferative phenotype over time (Anderson, 2008). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Multiple myeloma, a malignant disorder of the plasma cells characterised by uncontrolled and 
progressive proliferation of a plasma cell clone, and accounts for approximately 10% of haematological 
malignancies (Rodriguez-Abreu 2007; Rajkumar 2011). The proliferation of the malignant clonal 
plasma cells leads to subsequent replacement of normal bone marrow haematopoietic precursors and 
overproduction of monoclonal paraproteins (M-proteins). Characteristic hallmarks of multiple myeloma 
include osteolytic lesions, anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcemia, renal 
Assessment report

Page 12/144 
 
 
 
 
insufficiency or failure, and neurological complications (Palumbo 2011). Profound intra-tumoral 
heterogeneity is observed throughout the disease course but is especially problematic after multiple 
lines of treatment. The coexistence of different tumour subclones displaying different drug sensitivities 
contributes to both progression of disease and development of drug resistance (Barlogie 2014). 
The criteria for diagnosis of MM as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 
requires 10% clonal BM plasma cells or biopsy proven bony or extra-medullary plasmacytoma and 
evidence of end organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative 
disorder, or biomarkers of malignancy (60% clonal BM plasma cells or involved/uninvolved serum-free 
light chain ratio >100 or > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging studies). 
The course of MM is characterised by a period of disease control after initial therapy followed by 
progression, typically with subsequently shorter periods of response and relapse with each successive 
therapy (Moreau, 2017). The treatment of MM has notably progressed with the availability of new 
drugs and its combinations, such way that survival of patients with newly diagnosed MM has increased 
from approximately 3 years in the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years (Moreau 2015) 
along the last 15 years. Despite the significant improvement in patients’ survival over the past 20 
years, only 10%-15% of patients achieve or exceed expected survival compared with the matched 
general population. 
The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients with multiple myeloma is approximately 54% 
(Cancer.net 2020). With each successive relapse, symptoms return, quality of life worsens, and the 
chance and duration of response typically decreases. Therefore, there remains a significant and critical 
unmet need for new therapeutic options directed at alternative mechanisms of action that can better 
control the disease; provide deeper, more sustained responses; and yield better long-term outcomes 
including maintenance of HRQoL. 
Despite advance in therapy, MM remains incurable. Although autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) 
has extended survival in newly diagnosed MM, practically all patients eventually relapse, and with each 
successive relapse, the chance of response and duration of response typically decreases and ultimately 
the disease becomes refractory and results in cumulative end organ damage (e.g., renal, cytopenias, 
infections and bone complications). 
2.1.4.  Management 
The treatment landscape for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) has changed in recent 
years. Current treatment of MM includes glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, primarily alkylating agents, 
high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT, proteasome inhibitors (PIs, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib 
and ixazomib), immunomodulatory agents (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide), 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as daratumumab, isatuximab and elotuzumab) and the histone 
deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. Common standard regimens include either a PI or an IMiD in 
combination with dexamethasone with or without a monoclonal antibody such as daratumumab. The 
triplet combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) is a standard of 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment 
guidelines (NCCN 2020 and Moreau 2017). Newer classes of medications including XPO1 inhibitors 
(selinexor) and antibody drug conjugates targeting BCMA (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) have recently 
been approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) but have limited therapeutic activity and 
substantial toxicity. 
Assessment report

The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the previous treatment, the number of prior 
treatment lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
type of relapse (i.e. clinical versus biochemical relapse; in the case of biochemical relapse, treatment 
can be delayed). 
Despite multiple therapeutic options, MM remains incurable. All patients eventually relapse and become 
refractory to existing treatments. Median OS in patients who have received at least three prior MM  
lines of therapy and are refractory to both an IMiD and a PI is only 13 months (Kumar 2017). The 
reported ORR for approved therapies for the population of heavily pre-treated and refractory patients 
with MM, is approximately 30% (Table 1). 
Table 1. Comparison of Efficacy of Therapies for the Treatment of Heavily Pre-treated Relapsed or 
Refractory Multiple Myeloma 
In a recently published chart review, investigators from 14 academic institutions analysed 275 patients 
to determine the efficacy of subsequent treatments after disease progression on an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody treatment (Gandhi 2019). This multi-centre, retrospective, observational study 
investigated the natural history and outcomes of patients with MM refractory to CD38 monoclonal 
antibodies (MAMMOTH study). Patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of 4 prior lines of 
therapy (range: 1-16). Regardless of the particular salvage regimen chosen, the observed efficacy of 
the next treatment after progression on PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy was 
dismal.

The median OS for the entire cohort was 8.6 months (95% [CI]: 7.5-9.9), ranging from 5.6 months for 
penta-refractory patients (refractory to anti-CD38 antibody, 2 PIs, and 2 IMiDs) to 11.2 months for 
patients not simultaneously refractory to an IMiD and PI. Among patients who received ≥1 subsequent 
treatment after becoming refractory to anti-CD38 antibody therapy (90% of patients in the study), the 
response rate averaged 31%, with a median PFS and median OS of 3.4 months and 9.3 months, 
respectively. The median OS for patients who received no further treatment was 1.3 months. The 
results of the MAMMOTH study were derived from real-world data and support the lack of options for 
patients who had prior exposure to a PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy. Despite 
new therapeutic achievements with novel mechanisms of action, MM remains an incurable disease in 
which all patients eventually relapse. There remains an unmet medical need for new treatment options 
beyond the current classes of anti-myeloma therapy. 
B-cell maturation antigen, also known as CD269 and TNFRSF17, is a 20 kilodalton, type III membrane 
protein that is part of the tumour necrosis receptor superfamily. BCMA is predominantly expressed in 
B-lineage cells and plays a critical role in B-cell maturation and subsequent differentiation into plasma 
cells (Tai 2015). B-cell maturation antigen binds 2 ligands that induce B cell proliferation: a 
proliferation-inducing ligand ([APRIL]; CD256) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF; CD257) (Avery 
2003; Darce 2007; Patel 2004). Binding of BCMA monomers to the APRIL trimer triggers activation and 
phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ELK, and NF-κB through intracellular tumortumour necrosis factor 
receptor associated factor molecules leading to pro-survival gene regulation (Bossen 2006; Hsi 2008; 
Korde 2011). Comparative studies have shown a lack of BCMA in most normal tissues and absence of 
expression on CD34-positive haematopoietic stem cells (Carpenter 2013; Kimberley 2009). This 
selective expression and the biological importance for the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells 
makes BCMA a promising target for the treatment of MM. 
Belantamab mafodotin-blmf is a humanised IgG1κ monoclonal antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic 
agent, maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (mcMMAF) that binds to BCMA on myeloma cell 
surfaces causing cell cycle arrest and inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Belantamab 
mafodotin-blmf was recently approved on the basis of the Phase 2, open-label DREAMM-2 study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in patients with 
RRMM who had 4 or more prior lines of treatment, were refractory to a PI, an IMiD, and had failed 
treatment with an anti-CD38 antibody. The ORR of DREAMM-2 as assessed by IRC was 32% (97.5% 
CI: 20.8, 42.6). The achieved responses were deep, with more than half of responders (60%) 
achieving VGPR or better (Lonial 2020). 
Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy uses modified autologous T cells that are activated in 
a major histocompatibility complex independent manner upon binding to their target resulting in the 
lysis of the targeted cells. Immunotherapy using CAR-T technology to target the BCMA receptor has 
emerged as a highly promising therapy for patients with advanced MM who have exhausted available 
therapies such as PI, IMiD, and CD38 monoclonal antibodies. 
Early data for idecabtagene vicleucel, a BCMA-directed CAR-T immunotherapy, indicated that BCMA 
CAR-T therapy could lead to an ORR of approximately 85%, a complete response (CR) rate of 45%, 
and median PFS of 11.8 months (Raje 2019). Of the 128 subjects who were infused with idecabtagene 
vicleucel, the ORR was 73.4% for all doses tested and 82% for subjects treated with 450 x 106 
CAR-positive T cells or higher. The rate of CR/sCR was 31%. The median PFS was 8.6 months. Eighty-
four percent of the subjects experienced cytokine release syndrome that was generally mild (Munshi 
2020). Most recently, data for idecabtagene vicleucel showed an ORR of approximately 73%, CR rate 
of 33%, a median PFS of 8.8 months, a median DoR of 10.7 months, and a median OS of 19.4 months 
(Munshi 2021). On 18 August 2021, idecabtagene vicleucel received EMA conditional approval for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 
three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38

antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. On 25 May 2022 another 
BCMA-directed CAR-T immunotherapy ciltacabtagene autoleucel received EMA conditional approval for 
the same therapeutic indication, based on an ORR of 84.1% in the leukapheresed population and a 
median DoR of 21.8 months (95%CI 21.8, NE). 
Overall, there is an unmet medical need for more treatment options capable of achieving deep and 
durable responses that afford the opportunity for treatment-free intervals and improved quality of life 
(QoL) for patients with RR MM who have received ≥ 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 mAb. 
2.2.  About the product 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on a novel mechanism of action, 
providing an opportunity to treat MM patients refractory to approved medicinal products. Although 
limited clinical data were available, the ORR and CR rate observed were considered promising. In 
addition, the off-the shelf availability and less burdensome treatment procedure of teclistamab were 
considered important benefits from the clinical perspective. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The applicant is conducting a randomised phase 3 study, MajesTEC-3, in subjects with multiple 
myeloma who have been previously treated with 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including a PI and 
lenalidomide. Data from this ongoing Phase 3 study which is expected to be completed by March 
2028 will support the conversion of the CMA to a standard marketing authorisation. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed. 
Teclistamab will provide a novel, targeted option for the treatment of subjects with multiple 
myeloma, with a mechanism of action that is unique to all other approved therapies. Data from 
the MajesTEC-1 study, show that teclistamab confers superior efficacy in terms of objective 
response rates when compared with other available off-the-shelf therapies (belantamab 
mafodotin and selinexor) for patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma who have 
already exhausted 3 of the most commonly used therapies (a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody). 
Although the CAR-T therapy idecabtagene vicleucel has shown comparable rates of response in 
this setting, this treatment may not be suitable for all patients due to their potential to cause 
severe safety events, potential long waits from leukapheresis to treatment and product 
availability constraints (eg, restricted access and production of the CAR-T cells). Teclistamab 
therefore offers an alternative therapeutic option that will be readily available to all patients, 
with a favourable safety profile and superior efficacy in comparison to other off-the-shelf 
alternatives. Furthermore, preliminary data from Cohort C of the MajesTEC-1 study also suggest 
that teclistamab provides benefit for patients who have already been treated with a BCMA-
targeting ADC or CAR-T therapy, where there are very limited treatment options and is an area 
of further unmet medical need.  
Assessment report

• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
Based on efficacy, safety, patient eligibility and convenience advantages, teclistamab offers a 
promising new therapeutic option for patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma that will 
be readily available to all patients and has a favourable safety profile and superior efficacy 
compared with other off-the-shelf alternatives. Teclistamab also provides an option for patients 
who are unable to wait for manufacturing of CAR-T cells or unfit for this modality of therapy. 
Although the pivotal study adopted a Phase 1/2 design that did not utilise randomisation, the 
applicant considers that a delay to gather further or comparative data would be disproportionate 
from a public health perspective, as teclistamab addresses an unmet medical need and offers a 
new therapeutic option for heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, which outweighs 
the risks due to the immediate need for further data.

2.4.2.  Active substance 
 General information 
Teclistamab (INN) active substance is a humanised immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) bispecific antibody 
against B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) receptors. The BCMA 
targeting arm engages a BCMA presenting malignant B cell, followed by the engagement of an 
activated T cell by the CD3 binding arm, resulting in malignant cell death due to cell lysis mediated by 
secreted perforin and various granzymes stored in the secretory vesicles of cytotoxic T cells.  
The molecular mass for the predominant glycoform is 146,261 Da. The active substance consists of 2 
heavy chains (HC) and 2 light chains (LC), joined by disulfide bonds. It is prepared by controlled 
reduction and oxidation of anti-BCMA parental mAb (JNJ-63705473 Protein A eluate) and anti-CD3 
parental mAb (JNJ-63483043 Protein A eluate), resulting in an exchange of the Fab arms. The Fab arm 
exchange was facilitated by amino acid substitutions at positions F410L and R414K in the CH3 domain 
of the parental JNJ-63483043 HC to enable preferential refolding of the heterodimer.

 Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, Ireland (JSI) is the main active substance manufacturing site. The active 
substance is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality-control tested in accordance with 
good manufacturing practice (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The teclistamab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described and it 
encompasses the manufacture of two separate parental monoclonal antibody (mAb) intermediates 
(protein A eluates: JNJ-63483043, anti-CD3 mAb and JNJ-63705473, anti-BCMA mAb), a Fab arm 
exchange to produce the bispecific antibody, further purification steps, formulation, filtration and active 
substance fill. Both parental antibodies are manufactured in separate processes and combined in a 
subsequent bispecific antibody manufacturing process. The differences in the manufacturing steps 
between different sites are minor and considered adequately described by the applicant.Parental 
antibody JNJ-63483043 is manufactured (stages 1-4) at two different manufacturing sites: Biogen, 
Inc., USA (Biogen) and Janssen Biologics B.V., the Netherlands (JBV).  
Parental antibody JNJ-63705473 (stages 1-4) is manufactured at Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, Ireland 
(JSI). Stages 5-13 of the manufacturing process (purification and formulation of the active substance) 
are performed at Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, Ireland (JSI). There are minor differences in the 
manufacturing steps at different sites, however, the parental mAb comparability has been shown.   
The manufacturing process of the parental antibodies begins with the thaw of a single Working Cell 
Banks (WCB) vial corresponding to each parental antibody and serial cell culture expansions leading to 
one seed bioreactor containing the required viable cell mass and volume for inoculation of the 
production bioreactor used for the production of each parental antibody. Harvested cell culture is 
clarified and purified by multiple Protein A cycles per bioreactor harvest. The pooled protein A eluates 
(parental mAb intermediates) are bottle filled and stored until further processing. 
The formation and purification process of the bispecific antibody (teclistamab active substance) starts 
with the thawing, filtration and individual pooling of sufficient quantities of each parental antibody. The 
Fab-arm exchange (FAE) is initiated by combining the separately pooled parental Abs (JNJ-63705473 
and JNJ-63483043 Protein A eluates), in which half molecules recombine with half molecules from 
other IgG molecule. The purification of the FAE intermediate includes virus inactivation to inactivate 
any potentially present lipid-enveloped viral contaminants, two chromatography steps and virus 
removal filtration. The virus removal filtrate is concentrated, formulated, filtrated, filled into containers 
and stored.  
The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance 
criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described for each step. The active 
substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Reprocessing is not routinely performed as part of the active substance manufacturing process. 
Protocols have been included in the dossier that adequately describe the reprocessing verification at 
commercial scale on the first batch that requires reprocessing, for the concerned manufacturing steps. 
This approach is considered acceptable. 
The container closure system (CCS) used for both intermediates (Protein A eluates) and teclistamab 
active substance storage is a single use, gamma irradiated, pre-sterilised, container with a screw 
closure. For the active substance, a single use, autoclaved, container with a screw closure is also used. 
Schematic diagrams of the containers were provided. Container closure integrity of both containers has 
been demonstrated during freezing, storage, thawing and shipping of materials. The compatibility of 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 18/144 
 
 
 
 
the teclistamab active substance with the containers has been evaluated through stability studies. No 
incompatibilities between the active substance and container components of the bottles or bags have 
been observed. The containers were evaluated for potential extractables and leachables in a controlled 
extraction study and demonstrated low risk of potential leachables to patient safety. The active 
substance container closure systems are found acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Anti-CD3 and anti-BCMA substrates producing CHO cells were derived from parental Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cell line. Information on the source of the cell substrate and analysis of the expression 
construct to develop the Master Cell Bank (MCB) is described in satisfactory detail.  
Selection of single cell clones and production cell lines are adequately described. The adaptation of cell 
line to serum-free and protein-free media was sufficiently described. The identity of the cell was 
confirmed to be of hamster origin. 
Consistent with ICH Q5D guideline recommendations, a 2-tiered banking system is used to ensure 
supply of the production cell line to support the manufacture of the active substance. The tiers consist 
of MCB and WCBs. A new WCB will be generated periodically to ensure a continuous supply for 
manufacturing. The MCB is expected to last for the life of the product. The MCB and WCB are produced 
in restricted access laboratories following GMP. Procedures are in place to prevent cross-contamination 
with other cell lines. A labeling system is used to produce sequentially numbered labels for each vial of 
the MCB and WCB. Production of MCB and WCB is documented in batch records. The JNJ-63705473 
(anti-BCMA) and JNJ-63483043 (anti-CD3) MCBs and WCBs are tested are tested for identity, purity 
and microbial contamination, in accordance with the ICH Q5A and Q5D guidelines. Additionally, the cell 
banks are monitored during stability through determination of cell viability and cell growth, following 
thawing and culture of the cryopreserved cells. Stability analysis of the production clone is also 
sufficiently performed. Virus testing for the Extended End of Production Cell Bank (EEPCB) was 
performed according to ICH Q5A. 
A complete listing of the compendial and non-compendial raw materials utilised in the manufacture of 
teclistamab active substance is presented in the dossier. Compendial raw materials will be release 
tested as per the appropriate compendia. Non-compendial raw materials will be release tested as per 
the appropriate test methods and have specifications. No animal-derived materials of any kind were 
used in the creation of the anti-BCMA and  anti-CD3 MCBs. Overall, the cell banking system, 
characterisation and testing are adequately described. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
During the manufacturing processes for parental mAbs and teclistamab active substance, consistent 
product quality and process performance is ensured through comprehensive control strategy, 
encompassing release specifications for raw materials and consumables, critical process parameter 
limits, in-process testing and release and stability specifications for the intermediates and the active 
substance. The development of the control strategy and, overall, the approach to define criticality of 
parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) and tests is in line with relevant EMA guidelines. IPCs are an 
important element in the control strategy for teclistamab active substance and serve to control or 
confirm product quality and consistency during manufacturing. Three categories of IPCs for the JNJ-
63705473, JNJ-63483043 and active substance manufacturing processes have been defined by the 
applicant: 1) IPC with an acceptance criterion, 2) IPC with an action limit and 3) IPC with a predefined 
instruction, for which appropriate justification of their acceptance criteria/action limit/predefined 
instructions has been included in the dossier. Overall, the proposed IPC acceptance criteria, action 
limits and predefined instructions are supported. Analytical methods used for IPC tests in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

manufacturing of both parental mAb intermediates and teclistamab active substance have been 
presented. The analytical procedures have been appropriately verified as suitable for use (compendial 
methods) or validated according to ICHQ2(R1) (non-compendial methods).  
The microbial control strategies in place at each site involved in the parental mAbs and active 
substance manufacture are described in detail. Preparation and control to minimise risks for microbial 
contamination of facilities, equipment, and materials are considered sufficient. 
Intermediates specifications 
The release and stability specifications for the parental mAbs are part of an integrated control strategy 
to ensure product quality. Release and stability specification and batch data for the parental mAbs are 
provided. The proposed parental antibody specifications include general characteristics (pH), quantity 
(A280), charge heterogeneity, purity and microbial contaminants (endotoxin, bioburden). Identity tests 
(dot plot and ion exchange High Performance Liquid Chromatography (IE-HPLC)) are included. Batch 
analysis data for the parental antibody clinical and process validation batches were provided. Overall, 
the proposed specifications are considered appropriate for process intermediates. 
Process validation 
Process validation (PV) for teclistamab active substance has been carried out at commercial scale for 
manufacturing stages 1-4 at JSI (for parental Ab JNJ-63705473), at Biogen (for parental Ab JNJ-
63483043) and at JBV (for parental Ab JNJ-63483043), and for manufacturing stages 5-13 (for 
teclistamab active substance) at JSI. Validation of the teclistamab active substance manufacturing 
process was performed and four consecutive batches for each parental antibody (per manufacturing 
site) and four consecutive teclistamab active substance batches were manufactured and released. For 
all four active substance PV batches, parental mAb intermediate material from two or three batches 
was included. Process validation was performed by evaluation of the ability to control process 
parameters, ability to meet the acceptance criteria for all in-process controls, the ability to meet 
specification for all routine tests. An extensive set of studies for process validation and process 
evaluation is presented, along with descriptions of methods and tools. For each process stage, a brief 
summary, results and conclusions are provided. Except for a few deviations, the PV batches repeatedly 
met all PV acceptance criteria for the IPCs and process parameters, demonstrating consistent 
performance, reproducibility and robustness of the manufacturing process. The deviations were 
acceptably investigated and handled. In conclusion, the teclistamab active substance manufacturing 
process can be considered adequately validated. In addition, a programme of ongoing process 
verification is implemented after process validation to ensure the process remains in a state of control. 
Process intermediate hold times, active substance shipping and reprocessing have been appropriately 
validated, although commercial scale verification of reprocessing of several steps is still ongoing and 
will be performed on the first batch that requires reprocessing. Resin lifetime limits have been 
determined and will be verified during commercial manufacture. Ultrafiltration membrane, is re-used 
during multiple manufacturing campaigns. Maximum number of re-uses has not been specified, 
instead, the performance and acceptability of the ultrafiltration membranes is routinely monitored 
during manufacturing. This is acceptable and the verification programme is considered suitable. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial teclistamab active substance manufacturing process is the result of development 
efforts that occurred in parallel with the clinical development programme. Different manufacturing 
processes include Development process (used to manufacture toxicology batch), Clinical 10 mg/mL 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 20/144 
 
 
 
 
 
process, Clinical 90 mg/mL process and Clinical and Process Validation 90 mg/mL process. The 
following significant process changes were made between clinical manufacturing campaigns: active 
substance change, scale increase, addition of new manufacturing site. 
Extensive process and product characterisation were performed at each step to demonstrate 
comparability and ensure consistent product quality and process performance throughout clinical 
development. The essential elements of the teclistamab active substance manufacturing process, such 
as cell culture expansion and modes of chromatographic separation, were retained throughout process 
development. The development history of the active substance manufacturing process and the process 
changes made during development have been adequately described and sufficient details for each step 
has been provided. Production history of all clinical and process validation active substance batches 
has been presented. Information on manufacturing sites, dates of manufacture, batch size and the use 
of the batches has been provided.  
Four comparability studies are presented in the dossier. The comparability studies encompass 
comparison of the clinical batch release data, in-process control data, characterisation data, stability 
data and forced degradation rates (temperature, light). The aspects considered and the panel of tests 
included in the comparability exercise are considered sufficient and in compliance with ICH Q5E.  
Comparability Studies 1 and 2 are small studies, conducted early in process development, comparing 
one pre-change batch to one post-change batch. Given the stage of the process development where 
these batches are from and based on the data provided, this approach can be accepted. Based on the 
results from these two studies, it is agreed that the finished product batches derived from the pre-
clinical toxicology and the 10 mg/mL clinical processes, as well as 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL finished 
product batches, are comparable. Similarly, in comparability Study 3, the pre-change 180 mg/vial 
finished product and the post-change 30 mg/vial and 153 mg/vial finished product batches were 
considered comparable based on assessments of release and characterisation results and stability data. 
The differences were small and did not impact the biological activity and are not expected to impact 
safety. Therefore, no additional non-clinical or clinical testing is deemed necessary. 
Based on the presented genealogy of the batches used in clinical development, the commercial scale 
finished product batches have not been used in clinical trials. Thus, the comparability of scales was 
regarded as critical for the approval of the commercial scale process. In this study, three sequential 
pre-change and three sequential post-change active substance batches and one pre-change and two 
post-change finished product batches of each strength were used for the comparability exercise 
(except for stability studies). This is considered sufficient, as no changes to the finished product were 
made. The evaluation included active substance and finished product IPC results, active substance and 
finished product batch release, characterisation and stability results, active substance degradation 
rates under heat-stress storage condition and under photo-stress storage conditions. The pre- and 
post-change active substance batch results met the corresponding IPC, batch release and stability 
acceptance criteria and were within historical ranges. The differences in these attributes were small, 
did not impact the biological activity and would not be expected to impact safety. The degradation 
pathways for the post-change active substance were the same as the pre-change active substance. 
Based on the data provided, batches from different scales manufacturing processes can be considered 
comparable. Upon request, the applicant has presented additional data to demonstrate that the 
sensitivity of comparability shown at active substance and finished product level in comparability study  
is enough to prove comparability of the parental mAbs that are used to manufacture active substance. 
Characterisation 
The teclistamab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of an IgG4 
bispecific antibody, with Fc Ala/Ala mutations to reduce undesired Fc gamma receptor binding. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 21/144 
 
 
 
characterisation of teclistamab active substance involved primary structure, carbohydrate structure, 
disulfide structure and free thiols, intact mass and mass heterogeneity, charge and size heterogeneity, 
higher order structure and biological characterisation. The analytical results are consistent with the 
proposed structure. In addition, structure/function relationships have been characterised by forced 
degradation studies and structural modelling to evaluate the criticality of post-translational 
modifications for teclistamab. Sufficient data to demonstrate the lack of ADCC activity has been 
provided. The studies included in the characterisation are considered comprehensive and relevant.  
Biological characterisation results indicate that teclistamab has the ability to bind CD3 and BCMA cell 
surface receptors with high affinity. 
Heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size and charge 
variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. The N-linked 
oligosaccharide structures of teclistamab have been characterised by hydrophilic interaction liquid 
chromatography (HILIC) oligosaccharide mapping with MS and MS/MS analysis.   
Teclistamab active substance contains cysteine residues, which form disulfide bonds. Peptide map 
analysis by non-reduced and reduced peptide mapping using reverse phase ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-UPLC) with on-line MS analysis demonstrated that teclistamab had the expected 
disulfide bond structure for a properly folded IgG4-like bispecific antibody.  
Size heterogeneity of teclistamab active substance was characterised by AUC, Size Exclusion High 
Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) and Capillary Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Gel 
Electrophoresis (cSDS). The structure and function of HMWS isolated by SE-HPLC were characterised, 
while the levels of LMWS were very low and not sufficient for isolation and characterisation. The 
observed level of aggregation in the teclistamab active substance by SE-HPLC was low. The HMWS 
were a mixture of aggregates All of the LMWS were product related fragments. Protein fragments are 
likely to have lower bioactivity than the intact protein and are potentially immunogenic. 
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. All product 
related substances and process related impurities were adequately characterised. 
 Specification 
The active substance specifications comply with the provisions of ICH Q6B and include: general 
characteristics (color, pH), identity (dot blot), quantity (A280 protein concentration), potency, charge 
heterogeneity (IE-HPLC), purity (SE-HPLC, cSDS reduced, cSDS non-reduced), process impurities, 
post-translational modifications (Multi-Attribute Monitoring (MAM) peptide mapping) and microbial 
contaminants (endotoxin, bioburden).  
Demonstration of clearance of process related impurities was performed at commercial scale during 
process validation and with additional impurity spiking studies at reduced-scale. Based on the 
demonstrated consistent removal, routine in-process tests or active substance specification for the 
control of these process-related impurities are not proposed. Some of the process related impurities 
and product related impurities will be monitored by active substance release testing and an IPC test for 
the reducing agent is implemented for final active substance. The omission of release testing of 
excipients sucrose, EDTA and acetate has been justified by process validation studies. The control of 
excipient Polysorbate 20 is ensured by finished product specification. The overall approach is 
considered acceptable. 
The proposed release test to monitor active substance potency is justified by process development and 
process development studies.  
Assessment report

Acceptance criteria have been established based on evaluation or statistical analysis of release and 
stability data (including batches used in pivotal clinical studies), product and process knowledge, 
compendial limits and generally accepted practices for other commercial products. The finished product 
manufacturing process does not introduce meaningful changes to the product quality and therefore the 
active substance acceptance criteria are aligned to the finished product specification that controls 
product-related impurities over the finished product shelf-life.  
In summary, the proposed tests panel and acceptance criteria for batch release testing are considered 
adequate.  
Analytical methods 
Teclistamab active substance is tested using a combination of compendial and non-compendial 
analytical tests. Compendial analytical methods used for teclistamab active substance release testing 
are endotoxin (Kinetic Chromogenic Assay) and bioburden (membrane filtration). The methods are 
conducted as described by relevant sections of Ph. Eur. and have been verified for use using 
teclistamab test articles. Results of the verification were provided. 
Some  non-compendial analytical methods are used for teclistamab active substance batch release. 
Sufficiently detailed descriptions of the analytical methods including system suitability and test article 
acceptance criteria were provided, together with a high-level listing of reagents, materials and 
equipment for the assays were provided. All pre-determined validation acceptance criteria were met. 
The validation activities covered additionally evaluation of equivalence of the assays between different 
sites. In general, the methods have been validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). Ph. Eur. 2.6.34 
monograph has been considered in the validation of the residual Host cell protein  assay.  
Description and validation of all other analytical procedures used in routine control of teclistamab 
active substance (Colour of Solution, pH, Identity by Dot Blot, Protein Concentration by A280, Potency 
assay , Charge Heterogeneity - IE-HPLC, SE-HPLC, cSDS (Reduced), cSDS (Non-Reduced), and MAM 
Peptide Mapping) have been discussed in the corresponding finished product section. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data has been provided for a number of batches including process validation batches and clinical 
batches manufactured at the proposed commercial scale and at smaller  scale, clinical batches with the 
lower concentration and a toxicology batch. The results are within the specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Four reference standards used throughout the product development have been described. Research 
reference material (RRM) was used during developmental phases and a two-tiered reference standard 
system, involving primary reference material (PRM) and working reference material (WRM), is used for 
commercial manufacturing.  
Two RRMs prepared from two different active substance batches, served as the initial RMs for testing 
samples during product development. Both RRMs were qualified through a pre-defined release testing 
and additional characterisation protocol. All pre-set acceptance criteria were met in the qualification.  
For commercial manufacturing, an initial PRM and an initial WRM were prepared from a commercial 
scale active substance batch. The qualification was performed according to a pre-defined release 
testing and additional characterisation protocol. All pre-set acceptance criteria were met in the 
qualification. PRM and WRM  will be requalified annually using the commercial release test methods. 
The protocol for the qualification of future PRMs and WRMs is provided.

2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
 Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as a sterile liquid in single-use vial presentation for subcutaneous (SC) 
administration, containing 10 mg/mL or 90 mg/mL of teclistamab as active substance. The final 
commercial finished product contains 10 mg/ml or 90 mg/mL teclistamab in sodium acetate trihydrate, 
glacial acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20, EDTA disodium salt dihydrate, at pH 5.2 and stored at 2-
8⁰C.  
Each 10 mg/mL vial contains 30 mg of teclistamab in a 3.0 mL nominal fill volume per vial. Each 90 
mg/mL vial contains 153 mg of teclistamab in a 1.7 mL nominal fill volume per vial. The teclistamab 
finished product do not have an overage. Overall, the composition of both presentations of teclistamab 
finished product (10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL) are adequately described.  
The target product profile for teclistamab finished product required the development of a sterile liquid 
dosage form in a glass vial, for subcutaneous administration. The formulation composition for 
teclistamab finished product was developed as part of an extensive formulation development effort 
which evaluated parameters including pH, buffer type and stabilisers, based on prior knowledge with 
similar monoclonal antibody products administered by subcutaneous route of administration. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients and no excipients of human or animal origin used in the 
finished product formulation. Two finished product presentations at 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL were 
required to enable the strengths necessary to achieve the prescribed dose in a practical volume for 
clinical administration. The intended commercial formulation compositions are identical with the ones 
used during clinical studies. 
The commercial finished product manufacturing process was the result of development efforts that 
occurred in parallel with the clinical development programme. The manufacturing process was 
characterised and validated to ensure consistent product quality for each manufacturing run. The 
cumulative process understanding that was gained from development studies, development production 
campaigns, early to late phase clinical production campaigns and pharmacovigilance was used to 
establish the appropriate control strategy for the commercial manufacturing process.  
The container closure system for teclistamab finished product is composed of either a 2 mL (for 90 
mg/mL presentation) or a 6 R (for 10 mg/mL presentation) vial manufactured from clear Type 1 
borosilicate glass, grey chlorobutyl rubber stopper with fluoropolymer film and cross-linkable 
polydimethylsiloxane coating and silver coloured aluminum seal with an orange (for 2 mL vial) or royal 
blue (for 6 R vial) plastic flip off cap. Representative diagrams and information on the critical 
dimensions of the components are presented. The container closure system material complies with Ph. 
Eur. and EC requirements.  
The 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL finished products contain no preservatives and they are manufactured 
using an aseptic process. Container closure integrity tests were performed to validate the integrity of 
the container closure system and its ability to prevent microbial contamination. The choice of the 
container has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Studies to determine the extractables and potential leachables from the stopper have been conducted, 
in line with relevant guidelines. The data obtained indicate that there are no leachables related to the 
stoppers observed above the threshold of concern to patient safety. Therefore, the results support the 
use of the selected vial and stopper container closure system in the manufacturing of teclistamab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

Physicochemical compatibility studies were executed to investigate the in-use stability and 
compatibility between teclistamab 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL finished products and the materials that 
are in direct contact with the finished product during dose preparation and administration by 
subcutaneous injection. Based on the results obtained, total in-use storage time (including dose 
preparation, transportation and administration for the undiluted finished product) is supported. For 
commercial use, the total in-use storage time will be  limited to not exceed 20 hours. This conclusion is 
considered acceptable.  
In conclusion, pharmaceutical development of 10 mg/mL and 90mg/mL teclistamab finished products 
is adequately described. 
 Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The teclistamab finished product is manufactured, filled, packaged, inspected and tested in accordance 
with GMP. Janssen Biologics B.V., The Netherlands, is responsible for batch release of the finished 
product.  
The 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL finished products are manufactured using frozen 90 mg/mL teclistamab 
active substance. The manufacturing process consists of the thawing and storage of thawed active 
substance, compounding and storage of bulk finished product solution, sterile filtration, aseptic filling 
and stoppering of finished product vials, capping and optical inspection. 
The manufacturing process is, in general, described with sufficient details. Process parameters and 
IPCs are adequately set to control the process leading to consistent quality. There are no reprocessing 
steps and no intermediates in the finished product manufacturing process.  
A compounding batch size (which represents the commercial manufacturing scale) was validated 
during process validation. Validation of the manufacturing process for teclistamab 10 mg/mL and 90 
mg/mL finished product consisted of clinical manufacturing batches and consecutive process validation 
batches at the commercial manufacturing site. The analytical procedures have been either 
appropriately verified as suitable for use or validated according to ICHQ2(R1). Unit operations studied 
were active substance thaw, finished product compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
stoppering/capping, post-fill process steps.  
Sufficient information is provided on hold times, media fills, sterile filtration time, process validation 
batch consistency, the extractable and leachable risk assessment for polymeric product contact 
materials, filter validation, shipping validation and ongoing process verification. Risk based approaches 
will be used to evaluate excursions, trends and process shifts for any potential impact to product 
Critical Quality Attributes or process performance that are part of the short-term continued validation 
programme. The submitted data demonstrate that the process is generally well controlled, with little 
variation in the reported results, which were all within defined limits. 
In conclusion, the teclistamab finished product manufacturing process is considered appropriately 
validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
 Product specification  
The proposed finished product release and shelf-life specifications for the teclistamab finished product 
are presented.  
The release specification includes general tests (appearance of primary container, colour, pH, 
extractable volume, osmolality, turbidity), Polysorbate 20, visible foreign particles, visible translucent 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

particles, sub-visible particles, identity (dot blot), quantity (A280 protein concentration), potency, 
charge heterogeneity (IE-HPLC), purity (SE-HPLC, cSDS reduced, cSDS non-reduced), post-
translational modifications (MAM peptide mapping) and contaminants (endotoxin, sterility, CCS 
integrity).  
The strategy for setting acceptance criteria is described. The statistical methods used for setting 
specifications are described. Tightening of the release and stability acceptance criteria was requested 
during the assessment for some parameters.  
Overall, the parameters included in the finished product specification are found adequate to control the 
quality of the finished product at release and shelf-life. The acceptance criteria currently proposed for 
both active substance and finished product are recommended to be re-evaluated once data from both 
30 commercial active substance batches and of 30 commercial drug product batches are available. 
Process-related impurities for 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL finished product include the same impurities 
characterised for the active substance and encompass those derived from the active substance 
manufacturing process. No additional process related impurities derived from the finished product 
manufacturing process were identified. 
Product-related impurities in 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL finished product are monitored by appropriate 
release and stability tests to ensure product quality.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004 - Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical methods 
Teclistamab finished product is tested using a combination of compendial and non-compendial 
analytical tests. Compendial analytical methods used for finished product release testing include Colour 
of Solution, pH, Extractable Volume, Osmolality, Turbidity, Particulate matter (sub-visible and visible 
foreign), Sterility and Endotoxin (Kinetic Chromogenic Assay). Colour of Solution and pH are also used 
for active substance release testing. The methods are conducted as described by relevant sections of 
Ph. Eur. and have been verified for use using teclistamab test articles. Results of the verification for 
the tests for sterility and endotoxin were also provided. 
Non-compendial analytical methods used for teclistamab active substance and finished product batch 
release include Polysorbate 20 concentration, Identity by Dot Blot, Protein Concentration by A280, 
Potency assay, Charge Heterogeneity by IE-HPLC, SE-HPLC, Purity by Capillary Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate 
Gel Electrophoresis (cSDS, Reduced and Non-Reduced) and Post Transitional Modifications by MAM 
Peptide Mapping. In addition, the tests for Appearance of primary container, Particulate Matter (Visible 
Translucent By MDI) and Container and Closure Integrity Test used only for finished product release 
are presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

Many of the analytical methods are performed and co-validated at several sites. In general, sufficiently 
detailed descriptions of all the non-compendial analytical methods, including a high-level listing of 
reagents, materials and equipment for the assays, system suitability and assay/test article acceptance 
criteria and formulae for calculating the results, were provided. Appropriate parameters were included 
in the validation of all non-compendial methods. In many cases the method validation was performed 
using only active substance test articles, which are considered representative of the finished product 
test articles, as the protein concentration and formulation are highly similar. As many of the methods 
were co-validated at several sites, the validation activities also covered evaluation of equivalence of 
the assays between the different sites. All pre-determined validation acceptance criteria were met and 
equivalent performance of the methods between different sites was confirmed. 
Overall, the non-compendial analytical methods have been appropriately validated according to ICH Q2 
(R1) guideline.  
Batch analysis 
The applicant has provided batch analysis results for toxicology, clinical and process validation batches 
of teclistamab finished product. The process validation batches are representative of the commercial 
manufacturing process. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
See active substance section on Reference materials. 
 Stability of the product 
The applicant proposed a shelf-life of 18 months at 5°C ± 3°C for the finished product, based on 
stability data provided at the long-term storage condition (5°C ± 3°C), at the accelerated storage 
condition and at the stress storage condition The presented stability data has been generated using 
both 10mg/mL and 90 mg/mL presentations and both clinical and PV material. The stability samples 
have been stored in different size containers, representative of the commercial scale and material, 
which is acceptable. The stability-indicating properties of the analytical procedures for potency assay, 
SE-HPLC, cSDS reduced, cSDS non-reduced, MAM peptide mapping and charge heterogeneity IE-HPLC 
used in the stability studies were demonstrated during method validation.  
An assessment of the stability data at the recommended (5°C ± 3°C) storage condition for the 90 
mg/mL and 10 mg/mL finished product strengths showed that similar stability trends are observed for 
most quality attributes. The applicant’s approach is considered justified and acceptable. The stability 
studies are planned to continue up to 36 months at the long-term conditions. 
No significant trends can be observed in the provided stability data and the proposed commercial 
release and stability acceptance criteria were met over the proposed 18-month shelf-life when stored 
at the recommended storage condition of 5°C ± 3°C, in the proposed container.  
Photostability studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q1B. The studies showed evidence of 
finished product degradation upon light exposure, which was not seen upon shielding of the finished 
product in its secondary packaging (opaque paperboard carton), the finished product was 
recommended to be stored in its outer carton to protect it from light. This is considered satisfactory. 
A temperature cycling study was performed to provide stability data to support potential temperature 
excursions that may be encountered during transportation, storage and handling. A 10mg/mL and a 
90mg/mL batch were subjected to  temperature cycles and then placed on a long-term stability 
programme. Results of the study are currently available only for the initial time point (T=0). However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 28/144 
 
 
 
all physical and biochemical product quality attributes tested conform to the proposed commercial 
stability acceptance criterion and the initial data is consistent with results without the prior freeze/thaw 
cycle.   
Overall, the stability of teclistamab finished product has been adequately addressed in line with current 
ICH Q5C and ICH Q1A(R2) guidelines. The applicant commits to complete the stability studies as 
described. Confirmed out of specifications (OOS) results obtained at the recommended storage 
temperature will be reported to the health authorities.  
Based on available stability data, the finished product shelf-life of 18 months and storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original carton in 
order to protect from light) are acceptable. For the prepared syringe for subcutaneous administration, 
this should be administered immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, in-use storage 
times of the prepared syringe should be no longer than 20 hours at 2°C - 8°C or ambient temperature 
(15°C – 30°C). 
 Adventitious agents 
Mycoplasma and microbial bioburden are adequately controlled through use of a sanitary process 
design and appropriate in-process testing. It can also be concluded that there is minimal risk of 
contamination by TSE in the final product. 
The results of viral testing performed as part of cell line qualification demonstrate that MCB and WCB 
used for preparing anti-CD3 and anti-BCMA antibodies are free of adventitious and endogenous viral 
agents. These results also indicate that no viral contamination occurred during cell line development 
and cell banking MCB and WCB testing is reviewed as part of the active substance control, as well as 
the control of raw materials. Any viral agents would be detected by the in vitro assay performed during 
anti-CD3 and anti-BCMA manufacturing as a routine basis for the ongoing assessment of adventitious 
viruses. MCB, WCB and End of Production Cells are adequately tested for adventitious agents.  
Viral clearance studies were performed with a suitable panel of model viruses on qualified small-scale 
models. The total process clearance determined by summation of removal/inactivation methods. The 
safety margin over the estimated retroviral burden per Retrovirus-like particles is considered 
satisfactory.  
In conclusion, the evaluation of adventitious agents has been adequately performed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The active substance and finished product manufacturing processes and process controls are 
appropriately described and the processes are appropriately validated. Characterisation of teclistamab 
active substance was performed using an extensive panel of appropriate methods. Comprehensive 
control strategy for teclistamab manufacture is in place. Overall, the test parameters proposed to be

included in the teclistamab active substance and finished product specifications are considered 
appropriate and in line with relevant guidance. Sufficient stability data to support the claimed shelf-life 
for both active substance and finished product have been provided.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there is one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the acceptance criteria for active substance and 
finished product specification. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendation for future 
quality development.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends a point for investigation. 
3.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical programme for teclistamab was conducted in accordance with the ICH guidelines S9 
and S6(R1), as well as S7A, S2(R1), M3(R2), S3A, and S5(R3). Nonclinical studies were performed to 
investigate the primary pharmacology of teclistamab, identify a toxicology species for teclistamab, 
investigate the pharmacokinetics and potential immunogenicity of teclistamab in the test species, and 
to investigate the potential general toxicity associated with teclistamab. 
3.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Pharmacology studies evaluated the tissue expression of BCMA, determined teclistamab in vitro 
mechanism of action including bi-specific target binding activity (CD3 and BCMA) and specificity, and 
efficacy in BCMA+ multiple myeloma cell lines and in patient-derived primary myeloma cells, and 
efficacy in vivo in xenograft tumour rodent models. 
 Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro studies 
Target binding affinity and specificity  
Teclistamab’s bispecific binding activity was demonstrated: teclistamab bound to human BCMA 
(hBCMA) with high affinity, with average Kd of 0.18 nM and to CD3 with Kd of 28.03 nM. Teclistamab 
bound with nanomolar affinity to cynomolgus monkey BCMA (cBCMA) with average Kd of 6.5 nM (36-
fold weaker affinity than to hBCMA), and to CD3 with Kd of 38.48 nM. Teclistamab binds only weakly to 
rodent BCMA and does not cross-react with rodent or rabbit CD3. Hence, rodents and rabbits are not a

pharmacologically relevant animal species for toxicity evaluation of teclistamab. The cynomolgus 
monkey was selected as the most pharmacologically relevant species for the teclistamab safety 
evaluation.   
Teclistamab bound specifically to the BCMA+ multiple myeloma cell lines (H929, MM.1R and RPMI 8226) 
with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 0.5 to 2.6 nM. 
Functional activity (T-cell activation and cytotoxicity) 
Teclistamab in vitro functionality was demonstrated in CHO cells expressing BCMA and multiple 
myeloma cell lines. In BCMA+CHO cells and in the presence of T-cells (effector:target (E:T) ratio of 
5:1) teclistamab induced T-cell activation with EC50 value of 0.22-0.32 nM, and cytotoxicity leading to 
death of BCMA-expressing cells with EC50 of 0.31-0.89 nM. In cBCMA expressing CHO cells and with 
cynomolgus monkey T-cells, EC50 value for T-cell activation 1.38-3.9 nM, and for cytotoxicity was 
0.64-3.3 nM. The interspecies comparison of biological activity of teclistamab is shown in Table 2.

In BCMA+ myeloma cell lines, teclistamab led to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity ex vivo in the presence 
healthy donors of T cells (E:T ratio of 5:1) with EC50 of 0.07 - 0.7 nM (EC20 of 0.04 – 0.34 nM). 
Induction of activation marker CD25, on T cells was specific for BCMA+ cells and was observed with 
EC50 values of 0.15 - 0.50 nM in these experiments. No lysis was observed in the BCMA- cell line MV4-
11 or with control bispecific antibodies.  
Teclistamab -related T-cell activation correlated with the release of the INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, 
IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokines in BCMA+ multiple myeloma cell lines.  
Functional activity in whole blood (ex vivo physiological model)  
Teclistamab dose-dependently resulted in BCMA+ multiple myeloma cells cytotoxicity up to 88.5% 
when spiked into the blood of 6 healthy donors at an E:T ratio of 5:1. The mean cytotoxicity EC50 
value was 1.26 nM (range from 0.305 to 3.422 nM). 
Teclistamab dose-dependently activated T-cells up to 63.1% (as measured by % of CD3+/CD25+ 
T-cells). The mean EC50 value for activation was 1.406 nM (range from 0.486 to 2.2 nM).  
Teclistamab induced release of the INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, IL12p70 
and IL-30 cytokines. The arithmetic mean EC50 values for the most sensitive cytokines IL-6 and IL-2 
were 1.207 and 1.275 nM, respectively. 
Functional activity in patient-derived CD138+ MM bone marrow cells ex vivo  
Teclistamab bound to, activated T-cells and induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner when 
primary CD138+ cells were co-cultured with healthy donor T-cells (Table 3). The following average

efficacy values were obtained from 5 patient samples: T cell activation EC50 [EC20] = 1.33 [0.70] nM 
and cytotoxicity EC50 [EC20] = 2.53 [1.03] nM. A cytotoxicity EC90 value of 41.29 nM (6039 ng/mL) 
was estimated and used to model clinical efficacy dose predictions.  
Control bispecific antibodies did not lead to significant cytotoxicity or T cell activation in 4 patient 
samples, 1 out of 5 patients had minimal cytotoxicity at concentrations >67 nM.

Effect of teclistamab on BCMA downstream signaling and APRIL and BAFF ligand binding 
Teclistamab had no agonistic activity on BCMA receptor signalling as measured by phosphorylation of 
p38. In the presence of BCMA ligands APRIL and BAFF, teclistamab inhibited p38 phosphorylation by 
50%.  
Effect of soluble BCMA, APRIL and BAFF on teclistamab BCMA binding and functionality 
High levels of soluble BCMA (sBCMA) have been measured in MM patient plasma samples (mean levels 
of 15.27±4.58 nM). The median serum levels of APRIL have been 3.3 nM and BAFF 0.61 nM in MM 
patients. 
sBCMA or BAFF did not affect the binding of teclistamab to BCMA at physiologically relevant 
concentrations, and is not expected to have an impact on in vivo efficacy of teclistamab. BCMA ligand 
APRIL inhibited the binding of teclistamab to BCMA+ cells at physiologically relevant concentrations of 
≥0.6 nM.  
The T-cell mediated cytotoxic potential of teclistamab was reduced by 2-fold in the presence of 167 nM 
sBCMA and 16 nM APRIL. BAFF had no impact on teclistamab mediated cytotoxicity at concentrations 
up to 51 nM. 
BCMA expression on haematological and nonhaematological tissues 
Analyses conducted to evaluate BCMA expression in normal human tissues using flow cytometry, qPCR 
and immunohistochemistry collectively demonstrated that BCMA was expressed mostly by plasma cells 
and subsets of mature B cells.

Teclistamab bound only to T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) of whole blood from normal human donors and to 
mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients, and not in any other peripheral blood cell population 
(i.e. basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils, or eosinophils). 
Immunohistochemistry studies performed with a commercially available anti-BCMA antibody on normal 
human tissue microarray showed weak cytoplasmic staining in all 3 tissue microarrays in the adrenal 
gland and the brain. Weak cytoplasmic staining patterns were observed in 1 or 2 tissue microarrays for 
the following gastrointestinal tract tissues: stomach, basal crypts of the stomach, oesophagus, ileum, 
caecum, colon, rectum, and glandular mucosa. 
In vivo studies 
In vivo efficacy of teclistamab was assessed in three studies in humanised immunocompromised NSG 
mice tumour models. CD3×null or BCMA×null bispecific antibodies failed to suppress tumorigenesis in 
these models. 
Teclistamab significantly reduced tumour (origin of H929 BCMA+ multiple myeloma cells) growth at 
doses of 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg in the NSG mice, when administered at the time of implantation of 
tumour cells.  
Teclistamab inhibited tumour (origin of RPMI 8226 BCMA+ multiple myeloma cells) growth by 53% on 
Day 28 as compared to PBS-treated controls (p<0.05) at dose of 0.005 mg/kg in xenograft mice model 
(RPMI 8226 xenograft, T-cell model). The higher 0.05 mg/kg dose showed limited efficacy. In the 
repeated study in the same model, 0.05 mg/kg teclistamab dose was not effective, but higher 0.5 and 
2.5 mg/kg doses (administered IP every 3 or every 4 days for 8 total treatments post implantation of 
human pan T-cells) inhibited significantly the tumour growth (TGI). On Day 60 at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg 
doses, the TGI was 79% and 87%, respectively.  At the end of study, 9 of 10 animals at 2.5 mg/kg 
dose group had durable and complete TGI responses.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific secondary pharmacology studies were conducted with teclistamab. In the tissue reactivity 
analyses, teclistamab bound selectively only to CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells of whole blood from normal 
human donors and to mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients (data not shown). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular, respiratory, and observational CNS safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated 
into the pivotal 5-week repeat-dose toxicity GLP study (with an 8-week recovery period) in cynomolgus 
monkeys (see Section 2.5.4). The data suggested that teclistamab would not have adverse effects on 
the vital functions at the therapeutic dose levels. There were no significant increases in circulating 
cytokines in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with teclistamab. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were submitted, as teclistamab is unlikely to 
have pharmacodynamic interactions with co-administered drugs due to its high binding specificity for 
its targets, BCMA and CD3.

Exploratory single and 5-week repeat-dose IV tolerability study in cynomolgus monkeys 
(T-2015-030) 
The PK/TK profile of teclistamab was evaluated in male cynomolgus monkeys (3/group) administered 
IV a single dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg or 5 weekly doses of 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg.  
In the single-dose groups, serum teclistamab Cmax and AUClast values increased with dose in a dose-
proportional manner from 1 to 10 mg/kg. Teclistamab concentrations for 2 animals in the 1 mg/kg 
group and all 3 animals in the 10 mg/kg group showed a fast decrease after Day 15, which was likely 
due to ADA development. Therefore, AUCinf, CL, and T1/2 were not reported for these animals.  
In the repeat-dose groups, all teclistamab-treated animals had quantifiable serum teclistamab 
concentrations throughout the 5-week treatment period, with the exception of 1 animal at 
1 mg/kg/week with concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration (0.15630 μg/mL) at the 
Day 29 predose time point. Teclistamab exposure increased with dose in an approximately dose-
proportional manner. There was an approximately 2-fold increase in teclistamab exposure in the 
systemic circulation from the first to fifth dose, indicating moderate drug accumulation, except for 
1 animal at 1 mg/kg/week with lower exposure following the fourth dose on Day 22 likely due to the 
presence of ADA. Mean pK parameters following dosing on Days 1 and 22 are presented in Table 4.

Pivotal 5-week IV toxicity study with an 8-week recovery period in cynomolgus monkeys 
(T-2016-030) 
A pivotal 5-week repeat-dose toxicity GLP study with a recovery period evaluated the toxicokinetic 
profile and immunogenicity of teclistamab in male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Main study 
animals (3/sex/group) and recovery animals (2/sex/group) received weekly IV doses of 1, 10, or 
30 mg/kg teclistamab for 5 weeks followed by an 8-week treatment-free period.

Teclistamab-treated animals had quantifiable serum teclistamab concentrations throughout the 5-week 
treatment period, except for 2 monkeys (1 each in the 1 and 10 mg/kg/week groups) with 
concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration in a sample (0.15630 µg/mL) at the Day 29 
predose time point. Teclistamab exposure (mean Cmax and AUC) increased approximately dose 
proportionally from 1 to 30 mg/kg/week following dosing on Days 1 and 22.  
Following 4 doses, the mean accumulation ranged from 1.65 to 2.04. Exposure was lower following the 
fourth dose on Day 22 than on Day 1 in 5 animals (1, 2, and 2 in the 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg/week 
groups, respectively) due to the presence of ADA in these animals. No apparent differences in 
toxicokinetic parameters were observed between male and female animals. At the end of the recovery 
period, serum teclistamab concentrations were below the lowest quantifiable concentration in 4 of 
12 animals (3 animals at 1 mg/kg/week and 1 animal at 10 mg/kg/week). Mean toxicokinetic 
parameters following the doses on Day 1 and 22 are presented in Table 5.

at 30 mg/kg); exposure was lower in 5 ADA-positive animals during the Day 22 dosing period (1, 2, and 2 at 1, 10, 
and 30 mg/kg, respectively) and 2 ADA-positive animals on Day 29 (1 each at 1 and 10 mg/kg) compared with 
ADA-negative animals in the same dose group. 
b Mean of individual ratios. 
Distribution, metabolism and excretion 
Traditional distribution studies were not conducted for teclistamab, which is an antibody with a 
molecular weight of 146.261 kDa. Due to its molecular size, teclistamab is expected to be primarily 
confined to the vascular space with only limited distribution to the extracellular space, which is typical 
for IgG-based mAbs. 
As an IgG-based antibody, teclistamab is presumed to be catabolised and eliminated by processes 
involved in the turnover and degradation of endogenous IgGs.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were conducted, which is acceptable. 
3.2.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology programme for teclistamab characterised general toxicity and toxicokinetics 
(see Pharmacokinetics Section 4.2.3 of this report) in cynomolgus monkeys following IV 
administration. Repeated weekly doses of teclistamab IV were evaluated in a pivotal 5-week toxicity 
study in cynomolgus monkeys. To support transition from IV to SC dosing in humans, the local 
Assessment report

tolerance of teclistamab SC was evaluated in rabbits. Tissue cross reactivity, cytokine release, serum 
compatibility, and haemolytic potential of teclistamab was assessed in vitro. 
 Single and repeat dose toxicity 
The nonclinical toxicology programme for teclistamab characterised general toxicity and toxicokinetics 
in cynomolgus monkeys following IV administration. Repeated weekly doses of teclistamab IV were 
evaluated in a pivotal 5-week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (see Pharmacokinetics Section 
4.2.3 of this report). 
Teclistamab IV was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys. No teclistamab-related effects were noted 
in major body systems or in pathology assessments, survival, or clinical observations at doses 
expected to be pharmacologically active. The NOEL in the pivotal 5-week study was 30 mg/kg/week 
(highest dose). No microscopic findings were noted on histopathological examination, and no 
teclistamab-mediated effects were noted from overall cellularity of T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells (CD20), 
and anti-plasma cells on formalin-fixed spleen, mandibular lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, and 
bone marrow (sternum). Teclistamab did not significantly increase in circulating cytokines in 
cynomolgus monkeys. No off-target toxicities were noted in monkeys. 
Exposure in monkeys after 4 doses at 30 mg/kg/week teclistamab IV was 43 times Cmax and 22 times 
AUCtau human steady-state exposure at 1.5 mg/kg teclistamab SC weekly, the recommended weight-
based dose regimen, for subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in Phase 1/2 study

Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with teclistamab, as these are not 
required for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
BCMA is not expressed in female or male reproductive organs. In cynomolgus monkeys, no test article-
related microscopic findings were noted in the histopathology examination including male (epididymis, 
prostate, and testis) and female (cervix, uterus, and vagina) reproductive tissues in pivotal toxicology 
study. Based on the weight of evidence (EoW)risk assessment, teclistamab is not expected to pose a 
risk to reproduction or be teratogenic.  
Local Tolerance  
In the SC local tolerance GLP study (T-2018-019), male New Zealand White rabbits (6/group) 
received a single SC injection (2 mL dose volume) in the scapular region of 20 mg (10 mg/mL) 
teclistamab or sterile saline on the right side and formulation buffer on the left side. The formulation 
buffer (aqueous solution containing 10 mM sodium acetate, 8% (w/v) sucrose, 0.04% (w/v)

polysorbate 20, and 20 μg/mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, at pH 5.2) contains the same 
components as the drug product. Injection sites were evaluated for up to 72 hours post-dose, and 
animals were necropsied on Day 4. 
Two of the 6 teclistamab-treated rabbits had ≤Grade 2 erythema at the injection site. In 1 animal, the 
maximal erythema of Grade 2 on Day 2 resolved by the Day 4 necropsy. The other animal had Grade 1 
erythema on Days 2 through 4. There were no gross or microscopic findings in the injection sites or 
draining lymph nodes of teclistamab treated or control animals. Because rabbits are not a 
pharmacologically relevant species, the study tested the local tolerance of the buffer formulation that 
contains the same components as the drug substance formulation at a teclistamab concentration of 
10 mg/mL. 
In the repeat-dose IV toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys where teclistamab was administered at 
up to 30 mg/kg/week for 5 weeks, there were no teclistamab related effects at IV injection sites based 
on clinical observations and histopathology evaluation. 
 Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
The development of ADA to teclistamab was evaluated in the pivotal 5-week IV toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys (T-2016-030). ADA was detected in 21 of 30 teclistamab-treated animals (Table 
7).

doses of teclistamab in cynomolgus monkeys in a GLP 5-week study 
a 5/sex/group (3/sex/main study animals + 2/sex/recovery animals) 
Serum samples for ADA analysis were obtained from blood collected from all animals at predose on Days 1, 22, and 
29 and from recovery animals on Days 43, 62, 76, and 87. 
Immunotoxicity 
The flow cytometry for whole blood CD3 receptor occupancy, immunophenotyping of whole blood, 
immunophenotyping of spleen and bone marrow tissue, plasma cytokine analysis (eg. IL-2, IL-6, IL-
10, IFN-γ, TNF-α), and serum IgG and IgM level were assessed in cynomolgus monkeys (T-2015-030 
and T-2016-030). The repeat-dose toxicity studies revealed no apparent teclistamab-related adverse 
effects on the immune system. 
The tissue cross-reactivity (Studies T-2016-031/App5 for T-2015-051, T-2016-031) 
Studies confirmed the expected binding pattern which is limited to the cells of the B cell lineage. 
Binding was observed in tissues where BCMA expressing cells reside. The binding was essentially 
similar between cynomolgus monkey and human tissues.

Haemolytic potential (T-2016-047, T-2016-048) 
Serum and blood samples used in the assays were collected from normal human volunteers (3 
donors/study). No teclistamab-related serum precipitation or haemolysis was observed. Based on 
these results, teclistamab concentrations up to 10 mg/mL were considered compatible with human 
serum and blood. 
Cytokine release (T-2016-046) 
Teclistamab was shown to induce a statistically significant low-level secretion of IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α 
in normal human cells at concentrations of ≥82 ng/mL. The risk of cytokine release syndrome is a 
known risk clinically and it managed with tocilizumab treatment. 
3.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Teclistamab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no studies as part of the 
Environmental Risk Assessment for teclistamab are required. 
3.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
Teclistamab function requires the formation of a trimolecular complex by the binding to CD3 on T-cells 
and to BCMA on target cells to elicit pharmacologic activity. The pharmacology characterisation of 
teclistamab demonstrated the bi-specific binding with high nanomolar affinity to BCMA and CD3, and 
that teclistamab selectively promoted the T-cell dependent elimination of human cells expressing BCMA 
on their surface in vitro and in vivo. The T-cell mediated cytotoxic effect on BCMA+ MM cells of 
teclistamab at nM concentrations, and induction of cytokine secretion was also demonstrated in 
physiologically relevant conditions ex vivo in whole blood.  
The dose necessary for near (or full) elimination of tumours (cytotoxic EC90 of 41.29 nM) was 
estimated (and used to model clinical efficacy dose predictions) based on the ex vivo studies on 
primary CD138+ cells (5 patient samples) co-cultured with healthy donor T-cells, in which teclistamab 
activated T-cells and induced cytotoxicity with EC50 values of 1.3 and 2.5 nM (EC20, i.e. 20 % of 
maximal efficient dose values were 0.70 – 1 nM). The cytotoxic effect was appeared selective, but in 
one patient sample, low cytotoxicity at control bispecific antibody at >67 nM concentration was 
triggered.  
In xenograft mice tumour models, 10 and 50 mg/kg teclistamab doses (when delivered IP every 3 or 
4 days for 8 total treatments post human pan T cells implantation) significantly inhibited the tumour 
growth by the study D60 of 79% - 87%, and by the end of study 9 of 10 animals (dosed with 50 
mg/kg of teclistamab) had durable and complete responses. Significant reduction of tumour growth 
was also noted in another xenograft tumour model (H929 BCMA+) with lower teclistamab doses, i.e. 
0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg. The elimination of BCMA+ tumour cells seemed occur in wide range of 
teclistamab doses (0.05 – 50 mg/kg). Nevertheless, these studies provided the proof of concept for in 
vivo functionality for this bi-specific Mab.   
IHC data on normal tissues collectively provide evidence that, in nonmalignant cells, BCMA is 
expressed mostly by plasma cells and subsets of mature B cells, which also supports the data from 
previously published reports on BCMA expression pattern. The weak signal detected in brain and 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 38/144 
 
 
 
adrenal gland appeared to be unspecific staining and does not represent true BCMA expression in these 
tissues. This is also supported by the information from the literature. Studies by Carpenter (2013) and 
Bu (2018) found no expression in these tissues outside of resident plasma cells.  
BCMA RNA levels have been found to be negligible in normal brain tissues, but BCMA has been 
reported by Osorio et al. (2014) to have a role in neural development. Based on a recent publication 
reporting potential BCMA RNA expression in the basal ganglia (Mohyddin 2021), the applicant 
performed an assessment of BCMA expression in the brain (Marella 2022). According to these 
analyses, BCMA expression or mRNA was negligible in healthy donor of over 30 years of age brain and 
tibial nerve samples. Thus, the potential for neurotoxicity related on-target/off-tumour toxicity was 
concluded unlikely. 
Cynomolgus monkey was selected as a pharmacologically relevant species. hBCMA shares >90% 
sequence homology with cBCMA, and relative target binding affinities and functional activity in cell-
based assays of teclistamab supported the use of the cynomolgus monkey in toxicology studies. 
However, teclistamab binds with 36-fold lower affinity to cBCMA compared to hBCMA and the 
functional activities such as cytotoxicity and T cell activation were somewhat lower (2-20 fold) in 
cynomolgus monkeys than in humans. Although the cynomolgus monkey can be considered as a 
pharmacologically relevant animal species for evaluation of toxicity, results from studies in normal 
healthy monkeys (in which only very low amounts of BCMA+ cells are present) may have limited 
translatability to multiple myeloma patients, and the toxicity data should be interpreted with caution.  
High levels of soluble BCMA (sBCMA) have been measured in MM patient plasma samples (mean levels 
of 15.27±4.58 nM), and BCMA ligands APRIL and BAFF, and these ligands could interfere the activity of 
teclistamab. It was demonstrated that soluble BCMA or BAFF ligand did not affect the binding of 
teclistamab to BCMA at physiologically relevant concentrations, and is not expected to have an impact 
on the efficacy of teclistamab. APRIL reduced teclistamab cytotoxicity by 2-fold up to 16.4 nM, and the 
highest concentration of APRIL tested (48.1 nM) caused around 6-fold reduction of potency (EC50) for 
both cytotoxicity and T-cell activation. The levels of APRIL in multiple myeloma patients range around 
5 nM. Therefore, the activity and clinical efficacy of teclistamab are not anticipated to be affected by 
the presence of physiological levels of APRIL.   
Pharmacokinetics 
Teclistamab pharmacokinetics/toxicokineitcs is sufficient and no questions are raised. Serum 
teclistamab exposure, Cmax and AUClast values increased with a dose-proportional manner in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Serum concentrations of teclistamab were adequately maintained throughout 
the dosing periods in the studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, except for approximately 10% of 
the treated animals, likely due to presence of ADAs. 
Formation of ADA was clearly triggered by teclistamab in cynomolgus monkeys. ADAs were detected in 
most of the teclistamab-treated cynomolgus monkeys (21 out of 30 animals) in pivotal repeated dose 
toxicology/toxicokinetic study, and ADAs impacted the PK in many of the animals. Residual teclistamab 
concentrations in some of the ADA samples from ADA-negative animals were above the drug 
concentration tolerance limit for the ADA assay (100 µg/mL). Therefore, potential interference of ADA 
detection by residual teclistamab cannot be excluded, and the numbers for ADA positive animals could 
have been underestimated. Similar to repeated-dose toxicology study, after a single teclistamab dose 
in cynomolgus monkeys, a fast decrease in teclistamab serum concentrations was noted after Day 15, 
which was also likely due to ADA development. In repeated dose pivotal toxicology study, of 21 ADA-
positive animals, 14 had drug exposure comparable and 7 had lower to that of ADA-negative animals 
in the same dose groups. Despite the presence of ADAs in most of the animals, 28 out of 30 animals 
had continuous exposure to teclistamab during the entire study. Of a further note, the immunogenicity 
in animals towards human proteins is of a limited predictive value for the human immunogenicity.   
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 39/144 
 
 
 
Overall, mean serum concentrations throughout the studies in monkeys were higher than the EC50 
(0.09 to 0.48 μg/mL) for cytotoxicity with cynomolgus monkey T cells against cBCMA-expressing target 
cells. It could be concluded that monkeys were sufficiently exposed to teclistamab in pivotal study, and 
the safety margins (at NOEL 30 mg/kg IV weekly dosing) were adequate, i.e. 48 times the Cmax and 22 
times the AUCtau compared to subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in Phase 1/2 study 
MajesTEC-1 (at steady-state exposure at 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly, the recommended weight-based dose 
regimen).  
Toxicology 
Teclistamab was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to highest dose tested, 30 mg/kg, and the 
teclistamab exposures were sufficient and with adequate exposure multiples (AUC 22-fold) compared 
to exposures at steady state in Phase 1 (of phase I/II) study in multiple myeloma patients.  
Nevertheless, there were some limitations in the toxicology studies, including lower (36-fold) affinity of 
teclistamab to cBCMA compared to hBCMA and 2-20-fold lower functional activity (cytotoxicity, T-cell 
activation) in cynomolgus monkeys and lack of pharmacologic and toxicologic effects in the 
cynomolgus monkey serum concentrations higher than the EC50 for T-cell cytotoxicity. These results 
from studies in normal healthy monkeys (in which only very low amounts of BCMA+ cells are present) 
may have limited translatability to multiple myeloma patients. 
The applicant provided a comprehensive risk assessment for reproduction and developmental toxicity 
risk based on the weight of evidence to the clinical use of teclistamab. Teclistamab does not bind to 
rodent CD3 and binds only weakly to rodent BCMA, thus excluding normal rodents as a potential 
species for development and reproductive toxicology studies. In the 5-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
in cynomolgus monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs at 
doses up to 30 mg/kg/week (approximately 22 times the maximum recommended human dose, based 
on AUC exposure) intravenously for five weeks. It was concluded in WoE risk assessment that 
teclistamab is not expected to pose a risk to reproduction or be teratogenic. It is agreed that no animal 
studies are needed to address the risk to reproduction, and that the potential risks can be concluded 
based on the mechanism of action (including on-target/off-tumour toxicity, cytokine release syndrome, 
and secondary cytokine-mediated effects), which may have an impact on the developing fetus, and in 
the mother during pregnancy. These are appropriately reflected in the SmPC section 4.6 Fertility, 
pregnancy and lactation and section 5.3.

multi-center dose escalation study with dose expansion to identify the recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumour activity 
of teclistamab administered to adult subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

The Phase 1 part of the study comprised of a dose escalation (Part 1) and a dose expansion (Part 2). 
The Phase 2 (Part 3 of the study) had sparse PK sampling and consisted of Cohorts A and C. Cohort A 
included approximately 100 subjects with multiple myeloma who were triple class exposed (PI, IMiD, 
and anti-CD38 mAb) and have previously received treatment with ≥3 prior lines of therapy. Cohort C 
included approximately 38 subjects who have previously received ≥3 prior lines of therapy that 
included a PI, an IMiD, an anti-CD38mAb and an anti-BCMA treatment (with CAR-T or an ADC). 
Study MMY1001 non-compartmental PK results, RP2D 
In Phase 1, a total of 40 subjects were treated at RP2D and had evaluable teclistamab PK data. PK 
parameters for these subjects were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. The PK parameters 
are summarised in Table 8.   
Table 8. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Teclistamab Following the First Treatment Dose of 1.5 mg/kg 
SC in Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 in Subjects with Multiple Myeloma; Pharmacokinetics Analysis Set (Study 
MMY1001, Pivotal RP2D [Phase 1 Only]) 
The ARCmax was defined as Cmax, cycle 3/ Cmax, cycle 1, and ARAUCtau was defined as AUCtau, cycle 3/ 
AUCtau, cycle 1. 
PK steady-state was attained in Cycle 3 following the RP2D. Following the treatment dose of 
teclistamab at RP2D (Phase 1 and Cohort A), mean Ctrough was maintained above the maximum EC90 
value identified in the ex vivo cytotoxicity assay.  
Population PK model 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis used serum teclistamab concentration data from Phase 1/2 
Study MMY1001 Part 1 (Phase 1 dose escalation), Part 2 (Phase 1 dose expansion), and Part 3 (Phase 
2 dose expansion) with the pharmacokinetics data cutoff on 1st of December 2021.  
A total of 4840 measurable serum teclistamab concentration records from 338 subjects with relapsed 
or refractory multiple myeloma who received at least 1 teclistamab dose were used for the nonlinear

mixed-effects modeling. This included 83 subjects who received teclistamab IV administration and 255 
subjects who received SC administration.  
The observed concentration-time data of teclistamab were described by a 2-compartment model with 
first-order absorption and parallel time-independent (representing the nonspecific clearance for IgG) 
and time-dependent (representing changes in capacity of the target-mediated clearance) elimination 
pathways. The model was parameterised in terms of time-independent clearance (CL1), time-
dependent clearance (CLt), volume of distribution of the central compartment (V1), inter-
compartmental clearance (Q), volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment (V2), first-order 
absorption rate constant (Ka), and SC bioavailability (F). 
The covariates assessed in the population pharmacokinetic analysis included demographic 
characteristics (body weight, age, sex, race, region, ethnicity [Hispanic vs non-Hispanic; Asian vs non-
Asian]), disease characteristics and biomarkers (baseline total T cells, baseline soluble BCMA and 
soluble BCMA over time, baseline bone marrow percent plasma cells, baseline plasmacytoma, baseline 
type of myeloma, baseline lesion number, baseline lytic lesion, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group [ECOG] status, baseline International Staging System [ISS] staging, baseline revised ISS 
staging, cytogenetic risk), clinical laboratory characteristics (baseline creatinine clearance, baseline 
albumin, baseline alanine aminotransferase, baseline alkaline phosphatase, renal function, hepatic 
function), prior treatment and refractory status (prior use of anti-CD38 antibodies, prior use of 
daratumumab, prior use of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 [PD1]/anti
programmed death-ligand 
1 [PD-L1], prior use of anti-BCMA treatment, triple refractory status, penta refractory status, number 
‑
of prior lines of therapies [≤3 vs >3]), antibodies to teclistamab status, and drug product. 
After the covariate selection procedure, the covariate effects retained in the final model were the effect 
of body weight on CL1, V1, and V2, the effects of ISS staging on CL1, and the effect of type of myeloma 
(IgG vs non-IgG) on CL1 and CL2. Other covariates tested were not statistically significant. 
The parameters of the final population pharmacokinetic model are summarised in Table 9.

Table 9. Parameter Estimates of Teclistamab for the Final Population Pharmacokinetic Model  
To compare the effects of covariates on exposure to teclistamab for the subjects in study MMY1001, 
subgroup analyses were conducted on predicted exposure metrics based on the individual 
pharmacokinetic parameters from the final population pharmacokinetic model following the teclistamab 
RP2D, ie, 1.5 mg/kg teclistamab SC administered weekly, with the first treatment dose preceded by 
step-up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg.  
The model-predicted individual pharmacokinetic exposure metrics, predicted average concentration of 
the first treatment dose (Cave,1stdose) and predicted steady-state trough concentration (Ctrough,ss) at the 
RP2D, were compared across different strata for covariates of interest. No clinically meaningful 
differences (i.e., <20-30%) in the exposure to teclistamab were observed in subjects with different 
body weight when teclistamab was administered on the weight proportional dosing regimen. Exposure 
of teclistamab largely overlapped across body weight subgroups.  
The disease status variables including multiple myeloma type (IgG vs non-IgG) and ISS staging (II vs I 
and III vs I) affected teclistamab exposure. The simulated Cave,1stdose and Ctrough,ss were approximately 
33% and 47% lower in subjects with IgG type of multiple myeloma, respectively, compared with those 
with non- IgG type of multiple myeloma. The simulated Cave,1stdose and Ctrough,ss were approximately 
15% and 31% lower in subjects with ISS stage II, respectively, compared with those with ISS stage I. 
The simulated Cave,1stdose and Ctrough,ss were approximately 28% and 43% lower in subjects with ISS 
stage III, respectively, compared with those with ISS stage I. The applicant states that further clinical 
Assessment report

efficacy subgroup analyses and E-R analyses demonstrated that these covariates had no clinically 
relevant effect on efficacy at the recommended dose regimen. 
Absorption  
Following teclistamab SC administration, the typical value of Ka was approximately 0.133 day-1 based 
on population pharmacokinetic evaluation. The observed individual Tmax occurred 2 to 7 days after the 
SC administration of teclistamab on Cycle 1 Day 1. Both noncompartmental and population PK 
analyses estimate an SC bioavailability of approximately 70%. The noncompartmental SC 
bioavailability value should be interpreted with caution, as it is not based on individual results and 
combines the results of multiple cohorts. 
Distribution 
Typical IgG-4 mAbs are primarily confined in the vascular system. The population PK model-estimated 
typical volume of distribution for the central compartment was 4.13 L (Table 9). Volume of distribution 
increased with body weight. The typical peripheral volume was estimated to be 1.34 L. 
Elimination 
As an IgG-4 mAb, teclistamab is presumably biotransformed in the same manner as any other 
endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and undergoes 
similar elimination. 
In a population PK model, the elimination of teclistamab was described by parallel CL1 and time-
dependent clearance (CLt=CL2*exp(-KDES·Time)). The CL1 component is thought to reflect the 
endogenous catabolic processes of IgG degradation. The CLt component corresponds to the decrease in 
drug clearance as disease status improves over time post treatment, which may be related to tumour 
burden or target amount. The model estimated typical CL1 and CL2 were 0.449 L/day and 0.547 L/day, 
and KDES was 0.0328 day-1.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following teclistamab IV dosing, exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased approximately dose-proportionally 
across the dose range of 0.0192 to 0.72 mg/kg, both after the first dose and after repeated dosing. 
Following teclistamab SC dosing, exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner 
across the dose range of 0.08 to 6 mg/kg after the first dose, and across the dose range of 0.08 to 
3 mg/kg after repeated dosing.  
Special populations 
The effect of renal impairment as defined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula 
(normal [n=90, 29.2%], mild [n=141, 45.8%], moderate [n=76, 24.7%], and severe [n=1, 0.3%]) 
was evaluated in population pharmacokinetic analysis and was not identified as significant covariate on 
teclistamab pharmacokinetics. Also, mild hepatic impairment (n=34, 11%) was not identified as a 
significant covariate on teclistamab PK.  
No effect of gender, race or age on teclistamab PK was identified in the population PK analysis.  
The number of elderly subjects for whom PK data were available is shown in Table 10.

Body weight effect on teclistamab pharmacokinetics was evaluated and the final population 
pharmacokinetic model included body weight as covariates on the clearance and volume of distribution 
parameters. The effect of bodyweight on teclistamab PK is taken into account via the use of mg/kg 
dosing. 
in addition to the effects of bodyweight on PK, the population PK analysis found that the type of 
multiple myeloma (IgG vs non-IgG) and International Staging System score were predictors of 
teclistamab clearance. The simulated Cave,1stdose and Ctrough,ss were approximately 28% and 43% lower 
in subjects with ISS stage III, respectively, compared with those with ISS stage I. Moreover, the 
simulated Cave,1stdose and Ctrough,ss were approximately 33% and 47% lower in subjects with IgG type of 
multiple myeloma, respectively, compared with those with non- IgG type of multiple myeloma.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical studies examining the interaction between teclistamab and other products have been 
conducted. Teclistamab is not metabolised via CYP enzymes and is not expected to directly affect the 
CYP enzymes. 
 Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Teclistamab is a full-size, IgG4-PAA bispecific antibody that targets the CD3 receptor expressed on the 
surface of T cells and BCMA, which is expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B 
lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is 
able to draw CD3+ T cells in close proximity to BCMA+ cells, resulting in T cell activation and 
subsequent lysis of BCMA+ cells, which is mediated by secreted perforin and various granzymes stored 
in the secretory vesicles of cytotoxic T cells. This effect occurs without regard to T cell receptor 
specificity or reliance on MHC Class 1 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells for 
activation, leading to cell death of the BCMA+ cells. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Phase 1 
Soluble BCMA 
Following teclistamab IV or SC administration in the Phase 1 study, majority of responders had a 
decrease in sBCMA on Cycle 4 Day 1 (54 of 69 subjects [78.3%]), and a majority of non-responders 
had an increase in sBCMA on Cycle 4 Day 1 (10 of 16 subjects [62.5%]) compared with baseline 
values. Additionally, a greater reduction in sBCMA was observed in subjects with deeper responses to 
teclistamab (Figure 1).

Investigator; PK Evaluable Analysis Set in the Efficacy Analysis Set (Phase 1) 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest and Teclistamab Concentration 
To investigate the potential correlation between CRS and teclistamab PK exposure or incidence of 
antibodies to teclistamab, serum samples were collected at a CRS event of Grade ≥2 (at onset, then 
24 and 48 hours after [72 hours instead of 48 hours for the initial IV cohorts before Protocol 
Amendment 5]) in Phase 1, if feasible.  
Teclistamab concentrations ranged from 0.0676 to 7.79 μg/mL on or within 48 hours from the onset of 
CRS events (including step-up and treatment doses). Based on the available data, it seems that there 
was no clear correlation between the presence or grade of CRS and teclistamab concentration. No 
serum sample collected during a CRS event was identified to be positive for antibodies to teclistamab, 
indicating a lack of correlation between CRS and immunogenicity. 
Serum samples were also collected at a sARR event of Grade ≥2 (at onset, then 24 and 48 hours after 
[72 hours instead of 48 hours for the initial IV cohorts before Protocol Amendment 5]) in Phase 1, if 
feasible. PK data were available from 3 of 5 subjects who experienced sARR, with teclistamab 
concentrations ranging from 0.105 to 2.02 μg/mL. No serum sample collected during a sARR event was 
identified to be positive for antibodies to teclistamab in these subjects.

Pivotal RP2D 
Soluble BCMA 
Following teclistamab at RP2D, a rapid decrease in sBCMA was observed in the majority of the 
responders (PR or better) within the first month of treatment. A majority of responders had a decrease 
in sBCMA on Cycle 2 Day 1 (40 of 59 subjects [67.8%]), and a majority of non-responders had an 
increase in sBCMA on Cycle 2 Day 1 (27 of 28 subjects [96.4%]) compared with baseline values 
(Attachment TPKCONC03ARP2D). Responders to teclistamab also showed a trend of sBCMA reduction 
over time.  
On Cycle 4 Day 1, a majority of responders had a decrease in sBCMA (63 of 72 subjects [87.5%]), and 
all non-responders had an increase in sBCMA (9 of9 subjects [100%]; fewer non-responders provided 
data on Cycle 4 Day 1 due to early treatment discontinuation). In addition, a greater reduction in 
sBCMA was observed in subjects with deeper responses to teclistamab (Figure 2).

IRC; Pharmacokinetics Evaluable Analysis Set in the Efficacy Analysis Set (Pivotal RP2D) 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest and Teclistamab Concentration 
Based on the available data, it seems that there was no clear correlation between the presence or 
grade of CRS and teclistamab concentration. No serum sample collected during a CRS event was 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

identified to be positive for antibodies to teclistamab, indicating a lack of correlation between CRS and 
immunogenicity. 
Teclistamab concentrations ranged from 0.0549 to 7.58 μg/mL on or within 48 hours from the onset of 
CRS events (including step-up and treatment doses). This information can be useful also to have 
information on the range of concentrations at which the CRS can occur, often below the serum 
concentrations leading to a response. 
T Cell Redistribution 
T cell redistribution was observed in patients treated at the pivotal RP2D, as demonstrated by 
reduction in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the initial doses of teclistamab. 
Although the T-cell redistribution is observed at RP2D, a return to baseline value seems to be 
observed. 
B Cell Reduction 
Reduction of CD19+ B cells was observed in subjects treated at pivotal RP2D within the first cycle. 
Persistently decreased levels were noted at Cycle 3 (Figure 3). 
Figure 3. B-cell reduction over time, Study MMY1001 
Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
Subjects who received teclistamab SC starting at 0.24 mg/kg dose level demonstrated consistent 
pharmacodynamic changes indicative of the proposed mechanism of action, including T-cell activation, 
induction of cytokines, and T-cell redistribution. Optimal pharmacodynamic changes were observed in 
subjects who received 1.5 mg/kg SC. Greater induction of T-cell activation markers such as PD1, 
CD38, LAG-3, TIM-3, and HLA-DR was seen for subjects treated at 1.5 mg/kg doses level compared 
with the increases observed for subjects treated at 0.72 mg/kg SC dose level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 49/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Markers for T-cell activation did not increase consistently with further increases in dose. Consistent 
increases in cytokines such as IL-10, IL-2Rα, and IL-6 were observed for subjects treated at the 
1.5 mg/kg SC dose level. Optimal activation of cytokines was observed at 1.5 mg/kg as evidenced by 
consistently high median values for maximum fold change of cytokines when compared with other dose 
levels evaluated. 
Exposure-response model 
The objectives of the exposure-response (E-R) analyses of teclistamab were to explore the E-R 
relationship for selected efficacy endpoints, focusing on the primary endpoint of overall response rate 
(ORR) and other efficacy endpoints, including duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival 
(PFS), and overall survival (OS), in subjects who received teclistamab SC. A further objective was to 
explore the E-R relationship for selected adverse events (AEs), including Grade ≥3 anaemia, 
neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and infection, in subjects who received teclistamab SC. 
Various model-derived exposure metrics based on actual dose schedule information were estimated 
and used to investigate the relationship between teclistamab exposure and the selected efficacy and 
safety endpoints. The exposure metrics for efficacy E-R analyses included the predicted average 
concentration of the first treatment dose (Cave,1stdose) and the predicted trough concentration after the 
first 4 weekly treatment doses (Ctrough,4doses). The exposure metrics for safety E-R analyses included the 
predicted maximum concentration following the first treatment dose (Cmax,1stdose) and the first 4 weekly 
treatment doses (Cmax,4doses). These metrics were selected to maximise the number of subjects included 
in the analyses, and to avoid potential bias caused by exclusion of non-responder subjects with early 
discontinuation and potential confounded E-R relationships due to time-varying clearance as a result of 
disease status improvement following treatment. 
The populations included for different efficacy and E-R analyses are listed in Table 11. 
Table 11. Datasets for E-R Efficacy and Safety Analyses 
Exposure-efficacy results 
For pivotal RP2D efficacy data, the primary analysis population included 150 subjects at the RP2D in 
the Efficacy Analysis Set.  The primary endpoint for the pivotal efficacy analysis of RP2D was ORR. The 
E-R relationships between the selected exposure metrics and other efficacy endpoints, ie, PFS, DOR, 
and OS were also explored in these subjects (ie, RP2D only). 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 50/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Near flat E-R relationship was observed between the RP2D ORR and Cave,1stdose and Ctrough,4doses. For 
RP2D ORR, responders and non-responders had comparable Cave,1stdose exposures. Teclistamab 
Ctrough,4doses for responders and non-responders overlapped in their interquartile ranges (bottom panel). 
Overall, these results suggest no apparent associations between teclistamab exposure and the ORR in 
RP2D subjects, given that the exposure are comparable between responders and non-responders. 
The Kaplan-Meier plots for DOR, PFS, and OS in the pivotal RP2D subjects showed overlapping 
confidence intervals and no statistically significant relationship with either Cave,1stdose or Ctrough,4doses. In 
addition, the Cox proportional hazard regression of DOR, PFS, and OS vs exposure also resulted in 
95% confidence intervals containing 1, indicating no significant difference in these efficacy endpoints 
across the exposure tertile groups. 
As supporting analysis, since the ORR was assessed by the investigator (International Myeloma 
Working Group 2011 criteria) in Phase 1, E-R relationship in Phase 1 subjects receiving teclistamab SC 
dosing (n=72; 28 in <RP2D, 40 in RP2D, and 4 in >RP2D cohorts) between ORR and Cave,1stdose and 
Ctrough,4doses were explored. Positive E-R relationship was observed, and the response at the 
concentration range associated with RP2D is approaching the ORR plateau (or maximum response).  
Exposure-safety results 
All subjects who received teclistamab SC treatment in Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 Cohort A were included 
in the exposure-safety analyses. 
Part 1 and Part 2 subjects who received SC doses and Part 3 Cohort A subjects were included for the 
exposure-safety analyses (N=199; 28 in <RP2D, 160 in RP2D, and 11 in >RP2D cohorts). The E-R 
relationships for the safety endpoints including Grade ≥3 TEAEs of neutropenia, lymphopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and infections showed no apparent increase in the AE occurrence rates with 
increasing exposure (Cmax,1stdose and Cmax,4doses) quartile groups. A slight decrease in rate of Grade ≥3 
anemia with increasing exposure was observed, and this apparent relationship is likely confounded by 
the fact that subjects with more severe disease such as ISS staging II or III have a higher rate of 
Grade ≥3 anemia, while at the same time have lower teclistamab exposure compared with ISS staging 
I.  Consistently, teclistamab exposures were overall comparable between subjects with or without 
these TEAEs, indicating no apparent E-R trend. 
3.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK data contained in this MAA submission consisted of interim results from one phase 1/2 study, 
MMY1001.  
The PK analyses consisted of noncompartmental analyses and population PK modelling.  
The PK data showed that mean Ctrough were comparable between Cycle 3, Cycle 4, and subsequent 
cycles following the RP2D. The mean Ctrough was maintained above the maximum EC90 value 
following the treatment dose of teclistamab at RP2D in Phase 1 and Cohort A of Phase 2. The 
population PK analysis features a two-compartment model with both time-varying and time-
independent clearance components, both of which are linear. The time-dependent change in clearance 
(decreased clearance over time) may be caused by a decrease in target concentrations over time as 
the treatment progresses, or by a general improvement in patients’ physical condition as the treatment 
progresses. Even though the time-dependent change in clearance may be caused by a change in target 
concentrations, changes in soluble BCMA concentrations over time were not found to correlate with 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 51/144 
 
 
 
 
changes in clearance over time. Grade or presence of cytokine release syndrome did not correlate with 
change in clearance, and therefore it is unlikely that time-dependent changes in clearance would be 
caused by inflammation mediated by cytokine release at the start of treatment.  
The non-compartmental plots of dose-normalised exposure as a function dose suggest linear PK. The 
population PK model features linear PK. Teclistamab displays time-dependent PK.  
The population PK model had a fairly strict criterion of p<0.001 for the inclusion of covariate effects. As 
such, it is expected that only the most obvious covariates were captured within the model. No effect of 
gender, race or age on teclistamab PK was identified in the population PK analysis. The SmPC 
information regarding these covariates is considered sufficient. 
In accordance with Scientific Advice received from the CHMP the applicant did not conduct renal and 
hepatic impairment studies. Results of the population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild renal 
impairment (60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤ estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
or moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤ eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) did not significantly 
influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. Limited data are available from patients with severe 
renal impairment. 
Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
>1 to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and any aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total 
bilirubin ≤ULN and AST>ULN) did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. No 
data are available in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted, which is in line with the received 
Scientific Advice. As had been advised, the applicant has included a warning in Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC that the initial release of cytokines associated with the start of TECVAYLI treatment could 
suppress CYP450 enzymes and that the highest risk of interaction is expected to be from initiation of 
teclistamab step-up schedule up to 7 days after the first treatment dose or during a CRS event. During 
this time period, medicinal product concentrations (e.g., cyclosporine) should be monitored in patients 
who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. The dose of the 
concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.  
Because grade or presence of cytokine release syndrome did not correlate with change in teclistamab 
clearance, it is also unlikely that cytokine release at the start of treatment would affect the PK of other 
monoclonal antibodies to a significant extent. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Dose-proportional increases were observed in concentrations of various soluble factors and cytokines. 
Many soluble factors and cytokines reported in literature to correlate with CRS and neurotoxicity, were 
highly induced within 24 hours after teclistamab treatment and significantly associated with CRS. Early 
post-infusion, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-6 concentrations were increased and a trend was also 
observed for higher induction of CD38, TIM-3, or LAG-3 on CD4+T cells among subjects with a higher 
grade of CRS. However, and no marker that could be used to identify patients at high risk of these 
events was identified. Moreover, for the majority of subjects, the highest cytokine levels induced by 
teclistamab treatment did not correspond to the exact timing of occurrence of the CRS event. 
Soluble BCMA is a peripherally accessible biomarker of myeloma disease burden that correlates with 
the total number of normal and malignant plasma cells. Thus, declining concentrations in responders, 
and stable / elevated concentrations in non-responders are expected. However, the data available is 
insufficient to inform whether baseline level of sBCMA could predict the efficacy of treatment with 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 52/144 
 
 
 
teclistamab. To address this issue, the applicant should further investigate the impact of sBCMA on 
teclistamab PK, PD and efficacy in the ongoing/planned phase III studies. 
The applicant justifies the selected dose for RP2D by stating that “optimal pharmacodynamic changes 
and optimal activation of cytokines were observed and in subjects who received 1.5 mg/kg SC”. This 
assumption is partially supported by data showing increases in cytokines such as IL-2Rα, and IL-6 (no 
data provided for IL-10) at the 1.5 mg/kg SC dose level.  
The pharmacodynamics markers seem to describe the anti-tumour activity of teclistamab, but do not 
provide tools to guide patient selection, identification of high-risk patients in terms of toxicities, or 
clinically relevant new tools for monitoring treatment. 
Exposure-response model 
The exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses conclude a lack relationship between exposure 
and efficacy/safety at the RP2D. However, an exposure-efficacy relationship was observed in study 
MMY1001 Part 1 data. This is unsurprising, since the Part 1 of the study included very low doses, which 
consequently were associated with low response rates. The applicant concludes that the RP2D, the 
dose for which indication is being sought, lies in the flat part of the observed exposure-response-safety 
curve. While the model suggests that the exposure-response profile is flat, it is important to point out 
that the PK model predicts that ISS stage II and III patients will have lower exposures than ISS stage 
I patients. At the same time, a trend of higher ISS stage and lower efficacy can be observed. In other 
words, potential trends are present of lower exposures correlating with lower response probability, 
even though these trends did not reach statistical significance within the exposure-response model. 
The chosen exposure metrics reflect the PK at the start of treatment, and do not necessarily reflect the 
PK as the treatment progresses. The applicant argued that time-dependent changes in clearance may 
be caused by the response, and therefore the traditional assumption that exposure affects response 
does not necessarily hold; response may affect exposure. Therefore, the applicant argued that in order 
to avoid confounding, the exposure metrics used in the exposure-response analysis should reflect 
exposures at the start of treatment. This reasoning is understood. However, it is also known that for 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, which often contain time-dependent clearance, the magnitude of change 
in time-dependent clearance is correlated with probability of response. Since teclistamab PK also 
contains time-dependent clearance, the applicant was requested for additional analyses, where the 
magnitude of clearance decrease is used as a predictor of response probability and as a predictor of AE 
probability. In response, the applicant provided graphical analyses of %change in clearance versus 
response type, and %change in clearance versus AE frequency. There appeared to be a correlation 
between %change in clearance and response, with responders having a higher decrease in clearance. 
In this case, it seems likely that the response causes a decrease in clearance, and it seems unlikely 
that the decrease in clearance (and consequent increase in exposure) would cause the response. No 
graphical trends were apparent in plots of %change in clearance versus AE frequency. 
3.3.1.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has adequately characterised the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
teclistamab which therefore can be recommended for (conditional) marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing pharmacology data:

3.3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
 Dose response study 
Dose response was evaluated as a part of the pivotal phase 1/2, open-label, multi-centre, study 
64007957MMY1001 (MajesTEC-1). 
Selection of RP2D  
The registrational treatment dose of teclistamab monotherapy (1.5 mg/kg SC administered weekly, 
with the first treatment dose preceded by step-up doses of 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg) was selected based on 
the PK, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data available from Phase 1 dose escalation. Phase 2 
further established 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly as a safe and effective dose for the treatment of relapsed or 
refractory MM. The data presented in this section were collected through the clinical cut-off for this 
primary analysis.  
Target Exposure Based on Modelling (please also refer to PK section). 
During dose escalation, PK modelling and simulation were performed to predict a dose of teclistamab 
SC that would provide trough levels comparable to or higher than the maximum EC90 values identified 
in an ex vivo cytotoxicity assay. This assay assessed the ability of teclistamab to induce killing using 
mononuclear cells from bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma in coculture with 
T cells from healthy donors. PK results showed that mean trough levels following the first 1.5 mg/kg 
SC dose were comparable with or higher than the maximum EC90 values. At lower dose levels, the 
exposure dropped below the maximum EC90. In addition, SC dosing had a more favourable PK profile, 
with a low peak-to-trough ratio compared to IV infusion. 
Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
Subjects who received teclistamab SC starting at the 0.24 mg/kg weekly dose level demonstrated 
consistent pharmacodynamic changes indicative of the proposed mechanism of action, including T cell 
activation, induction of cytokines, and T cell redistribution. Optimal pharmacodynamic changes were 
observed in subjects who received 1.5 mg/kg SC. Greater induction of T cell activation markers such 
as PD-1, CD38, LAG-3, TIM-3, and HLA-DR was seen for subjects treated at the 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly 
dose level compared with the increases observed for subjects treated at the 0.72 mg/kg SC dose 
weekly level Markers for T cell activation did not increase consistently with further increases in dose. 
Consistent increases in cytokines such as IL-10, IL-2Rα, and IL-6 were observed for subjects treated at 
the 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly dose level. Optimal activation of cytokines was observed at 1.5 mg/kg SC 
weekly, as evidenced by consistently high median values for maximum fold change of cytokines when 
compared to other dose levels evaluated. These data represent maximum fold changes through Cycle 
1. 
Clinical Safety 
The safety profile observed at the 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly dose level was consistent with that observed 
at lower dose levels. Step-up doses were used to mitigate the risk of high-grade CRS. As of 07 
September 2021, 165 subjects were evaluated for safety at 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly. No DLTs were 
observed at this dose level among subjects evaluated by the SET for this purpose. The most frequently 
reported (≥20%) TEAEs were CRS (71.5%), neutropenia (65.5%), anaemia (49.7%), 
thrombocytopenia (38.2%), lymphopenia (33.9%), injection site erythema (25.5%), fatigue (24.8%), 
nausea (24.2%), headache (21.8%), and diarrhea (20.6%). Overall, a low rate of treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 54/144 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation due to TEAE was observed, with only 1 subject ((<1%) discontinuing treatment due to 
TEAE, and no subject reducing the dose of teclistamab. No subject died due to aTEAE judged by the 
investigator as related to teclistamab.  
CRS was manageable and reversible. Eighty-two subjects (49.7%) experienced maximum Grade 1 CRS 
and 35 (21.2%) experienced maximum Grade 2 CRS. One subject experienced Grade 3 CRS in the 
context of concurrent pneumonia. Sixty subjects (36.4%) were treated with tocilizumab, 13 (7.9%) 
received steroids, and 21 (12.7%) received low-flow oxygen to treat CRS. The subject who 
experienced Grade 3 CRS required a single vasopressor. No subject required treatment discontinuation 
for CRS; all events resolved. 
Neurotoxicity was observed infrequently (21 subjects [12.7%]) and was low grade at 1.5 mg/kg SC 
weekly. The most frequently reported neurotoxicity event was headache. Five subjects (3.0%) had 
ICANS, all Grade 1 or Grade 2. Nearly all neurotoxicity (33/36 events) resolved, with events of Grade 2 
hypoesthesia, Grade 2 dysgeusia, and Grade 1 headache ongoing as of the clinical cut-off.  
None of the subjects who received RP2D developed ADAs against teclistamab. 
At 3 mg/kg SC weekly (n=5), the CRS and neurotoxicity profile appeared consistent with those for 
1.5 mg/kg SC weekly; however, 1 subject had a dose reduction to 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly for TEAEs of 
vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. The safety profile at 6 mg/kg SC weekly appears consistent with that 
for lower dose levels, but analysis for this dose level is limited by short duration of follow-up. 
Clinical Efficacy (detailed results from this part of the study are presented under Section 2.6.5.6 in this 
report).  
As of 07 September 2021, 150 subjects were included in the Efficacy Analysis Set at 1.5 mg/kg SC 
weekly. This dose of teclistamab led to a compelling efficacy profile for heavily pre-treated patients 
with myeloma, with an ORR of 62.0% (95% CI: 53.7% to 69.8%) and rapid median onset of response 
of approximately 1 month. Responses to teclistamab deepened over time, where 58.0%of patients 
achieved VGPR or better and 28.7% achieved CR or better. Among patients who achieved CR or better, 
the MRD-negativity rate at 10-5 was 41.9%. Responses were durable, with a median DOR that was not 
reached. The probabilities of responders remaining in response at and 9 months were 92.5% (95% CI: 
80.6% to 97.2%) and 85.9% (95% CI: 70.0% to 93.7%). 
At SC dose levels below 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly, the ORR was lower (n=13, ORR was 46.2%). Subjects 
assigned to the 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly dosing cohort had an ORR of 60% (9 of 15 subjects); however, 
1 of 9 responders had their first response observed after increasing the teclistamab dose to 1.5 mg/kg. 
Importantly, the 6-month event-free rate for DOR at the 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly dose level was only 
77.8%, compared with 92.1% for responders treated at 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly in Phase 1 (n=26). 
Efficacy analysis for subjects treated at 3 mg/kg SC weekly is limited by small numbers or short 
duration of follow-up, but it appears consistent with the 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly dose level. 
 Main study

The study was conducted in 3 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) to identify the recommended phase 2 
dose(s) [RP2D(s)], dose expansion at RP2Ds (Part 2), and phase 2 dose expansion in cohorts of 
subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who previously received at least 3 prior lines of 
therapy and were triple-class exposed (Part 3).  
Part 3 was added to the study protocol after an amendment in July 2020 to evaluate efficacy and 
safety at RP2D administered SC in cohorts of subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
with unmet medical need given their heavily pre-treated status. 
The study was initiated with a biweekly (every 2 weeks; Q2W) IV dosing schedule. Based on review of 
the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic data, an RP2D treatment dose of 
1500 µg/kg of teclistamab SC was selected for Part 3. 
The phase 2 was divided in two cohorts:  
- 
- 
in Cohort A, subjects received at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including a PI, an IMiD and an 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.  
In Cohort C, subjects received an anti BCMA therapy (antibody drug conjugate [ADC] or 
chimeric antigen receptor T cell [CAR-T]) in addition to the therapeutic classes and lines of 
therapy required for Cohort A. 
The study was divided into 3 periods: a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a posttreatment 
follow-up phase.

•  Treatments 
Teclistamab was administered by SC injection at 60 and 300 μg/kg (priming doses) followed by a 
1500 μg/kg (1.5 mg/kg) weekly treatment dose. 
Priming Dose Schedule: The priming schedule consists of 2 priming doses: a first priming dose of 
60 μg/kg followed by a second priming dose of 300 μg/kg. Each priming dose is separated by 2 to 
4 days and to be completed 2 to 4 days prior to the first treatment dose. 
If there are no delays in treatment, the first treatment dose should be administered 4-8 days after 
the first priming dose and 2-4 days after the second priming dose.  
Treatment Dose Schedule: full doses on each dosing day. 
Weekly dosing: Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle.

the IMWG-based response criteria (2016). 
A central laboratory was used for disease evaluations (M-protein and serum free light chain 
measurements, and immunofixation determinations in serum and 24-hour urine). Bone marrow 
samples to assess for plasma cell percentage and clonality were analysed locally; bone marrow 
samples to assess for MRD negativity were analysed centrally. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Overall Response Rate 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was ORR, defined as sCR+CR+VGPR+PR, according to 
2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria and as assessed by IRC. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Duration of Response 
DoR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of PR or better until the earliest date 
of disease progression (PD) per IMWG, or death due to PD among participants or death due to 
PD, whichever occurs first. Relapse from CR is not considered as disease progression. For subjects 
who have not progressed, data will be censored at the last disease evaluation before the start of 
any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. 
VGPR or better/CR or better/sCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a VGPR or 
better response according to the IMWG (2016) criteria. 
Time to Response 
TTR is defined as the time between date of first dose of study drug and the first efficacy 
evaluation that the subject has met all criteria for PR or better. 
Progression-Free Survival 
PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first 
documented disease progression, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. For subjects who have not progressed and are alive, data will be censored 
at the last disease evaluation before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. 
Overall Survival 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 59/144 
 
 
 
 
 
OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the subject’s 
death. If the subject is alive or the vital status is unknown, then the subject’s data will be 
censored at the date the subject was last known to be alive. 
Time to Next Treatment (TTNT)  
TTNT is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the start of the next line 
treatment. 
Minimal Residual Disease 
Exploratory Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate is the proportion of subjects who 
achieved MRD-negative status to a threshold of 10-5 at any timepoint after initial dose of 
teclistamab and before disease progression or starting subsequent therapy. 
Patient-reported Outcome Analyses 
Change from baseline in overall HRQoL, symptoms, and functioning were capture using the 
following PRO measures: 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-
30 item (EORTC QLQ-C30). 
EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). 
Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS).

•  Sample size 
Part 3 (Phase 2) 
The sample size requirements for the cohorts enrolled in Phase 2 were as follows: 
•  Cohort A: With approximately 100 subjects treated with teclistamab, there would be >85% 
power to declare the ORR is higher than 30% at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025 with the 
assumption that ORR among those treated with teclistamab would be at least 45%. Subjects 
treated with teclistamab who have a non-evaluable response would be counted as non-
responders in the ORR assessment. An interim analysis for futility was to occur after 30 
subjects in Cohort A became evaluable for futility (received at least 8 weeks of study treatment 
and completed at least 2 postbaseline disease assessments, progressed, died, or discontinued 
treatment for reasons other than disease progression). 
To achieve >90% power to declare the ORR was higher than 30%, at least 112 subjects would 
need to receive RP2D. 
o  Cohort C: Simon’s 2-stage design was used to test the null hypothesis that the ORR was at 
most 15%, against the alternative that the ORR was at least 35%. With a 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 and a power of 80%, Cohort C needed 34 response-evaluable 
subjects. Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 10%, the total sample size required for Cohort 
C was approximately 38 subjects. An interim analysis to assess futility occurred when 21 
subjects were enrolled and had been followed for at least 2 cycles to be evaluable for 
response or discontinued early. At that time, 25 subjects were evaluable for safety. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 60/144 
 
 
 
 
 
This was an open-label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
For the pivotal RP2D, ORR (per IRC assessment) and 2-sided 95% exact CI were calculated for 
each cohort, based on the IMWG 2016 response criteria.  
Homogeneity of ORR treatment effect was assessed across prespecified subgroups. Sensitivity 
analyses of ORR were performed for pivotal RP2D data using disease response based on: 
•  Computerised algorithm according to IMWG 2016 response criteria (Phase 1 at RP2D and 
Phase 2) 
•  Investigator assessment according to IMWG 2016 response criteria for Phase 2) and IMWG 
2011 response criteria for Phase 1. 
•  Kappa statistics and 95% CI were calculated for assessing agreement between IRC assessment 
and computerised algorithm assessment for response (response [PR or better] vs no 
response). 
A sensitivity analysis was performed for ORR in which subjects who died due to COVID-19 and 
were not evaluable for response were excluded. 
Supplementary analyses of ORR were performed for the Response Evaluable Analysis Set. 
VGPR or better rate, CR or better rate, sCR rate, and ORR in subjects with high-risk cytogenetics 
at baseline, and their 2-sided 95% exact CI were calculated, as assessed by the IRC, based on the 
IMWG 2016 response criteria. 
Time-to-event endpoints, including DOR, PFS, and OS, and TTNT were evaluated using Kaplan-
Meier method, and the median value and corresponding 95% CI were provided for each. 
MRD-negativity rate and its 2-sided 95% exact CI were calculated and TTR, PROs, and biomarker data 
were summarised descriptively. 
An interim analysis for futility was performed for Cohort A in Phase 2 after 30 subjects in this cohort 
became evaluable for futility. The stopping boundary for Cohort A was exceeded (more than 6 of 
30 subjects had responded). 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
In total, 165 subjects (40 in Phase 1 and 125 in Cohort A in Phase 2) received at least 1 dose of 
teclistamab at RP2D on or before the clinical cut-off of 07 September 2021 and were included in the All 
Treated Analysis Set for pivotal RP2D data. Subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set for pivotal RP2D 
were included in the Efficacy Analysis Set for this population if they received their first dose of 
teclistamab by 18 March 2021. 
For subjects in the pivotal RP2D in the Efficacy Analysis Set, 104 (69.3%) remained in the study as of 
the clinical cut-off. As of the clinical cut-off date, the median follow-up in this set was 9.8 months 
(range: 0.5 [subject died] to 20.3 months. Seventy-five subjects (50.0%) remained on treatment; the 
primary reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (51 of 75 subjects).

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was ORR per IMWG as determined by IRC. The ORR as 
assessed by IRC was 62.0% (95% CI: 53.7% to 69.8%). Most responses occurred rapidly, by the start 
of Cycle 2. Many responses deepened over time, from an initial response of PR or VGPR, to a best

Similar results were obtained by sensitivity analysis via computerised algorithm. In addition, there was 
a high degree of concordance between the assessments by IRC and by computerised algorithm:

Table 17. Best Confirmed Response based on IRC (MajesTEC-1study, RP2D, phase 1 and Cohort A, 
phase 2, data cut-off:16 March 2022) 
ORR was examined based on the IRC data in prespecified subgroups, including number of lines of prior 
therapy, refractoriness to prior therapy and cytogenetic risk at baseline. Subgroup analyses 
demonstrated that teclistamab delivered generally consistent ORR in subjects treated at RP2D across 
pre-specified clinically relevant subgroups (Figure 4).

Duration of Response 
The median DOR was not reached as of the initial data cut-off. Among responders, median follow-up was 
8.0 months (range: 2.4 [subject died] to 18.0) and 91.4% had at least 6 months of follow-up.  
With a median follow-up of 14.1 months (data cut-off: 16 March 2022), median DOR for subjects 
treated at pivotal RP2D (All Treated Analysis Set) was 18.4 months (95% CI: 14.9 to NE) with 68.3% 
of responders censored Table 18). 
Results for DOR were generally similar across subgroups (data not shown).

•  Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy data from phase 2 part of the study 64007957MMY1001 (Cohort C) 
A total of 40 subjects received at least 1 dose of teclistamab in Cohort C (i.e., subjects with prior anti-
BCMA therapy) in Phase 2 on or before the clinical cutoff of 16 March 2022 and were included in the 
All-Treated Analysis Set for Cohort C (Table 20).  
Table 20.Treatment disposition; All Treated Analysis Set (MajesTEC-1 study; Cohort C, data cut-off 
date: 16 March 2022) 
Of the total deaths (n=17), 6 (15% of all subjects treated in Cohort C) occurred within 60 days of the 
first dose of teclistamab. During this time period, 3 subjects (7.5%) died due to progressive disease, 1 
subject died due to COVID-19 (reported as an AE), 1 subject died due to cardiac failure (reported as 
an AE), and 1 subject died due to coronary artery dissection (reported as an AE). 
Median follow-up of 12.5 months (range 0.66 [subject died] to 14.42). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics  
In the All-Treated Analysis Set, the median age of subjects treated in Cohort C was 63.5 years 
(range: 32 to 82). Twenty-five subjects (57.5%) were male and 15 (36.8%) were female. Most 
subjects (30 [75%]) had an ECOG score of 1. 
Assessment report

The median time from diagnosis of multiple myeloma to enrollment in the study was 6.5 years (range: 
1.1 to 24.1). Eleven subjects (28.9%) had 1 or more extramedullary plasmacytomas at baseline. Of 
the 34 subjects with baseline cytogenetic data reported, 11 subjects (32.4%) had at least 1 high-risk 
abnormality, most commonly del(17p). Among all subjects treated in Cohort C, 20 (52.6%) were ISS 
Stage I and 9 (23.7%) were ISS Stage III. 
Prior Exposure  
All subjects treated in Cohort C received at least 3 prior lines of multiple myeloma therapy, 11 subjects 
(28.9%) received 5 prior lines of therapy, and 20 (52.6%) received more than 5 prior lines of therapy. 
The median number of lines of prior therapy was 6 (range: 3 to 14). All 38 subjects (100.0%) were 
triple-class exposed (PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) and a majority were penta-
exposed (at least 2 PIs, at least 2 IMiDs, and at least 1 anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody; 30 subjects 
[78.9%]). Per inclusion criteria for Cohort C, all subjects (100.0%) received prior anti-BCMA therapy. 
Among those treated in Cohort C, 89.5% had prior transplant. 
Overall Response Rate by IRC  
ORR (PR or better) as assessed by the IRC was 52.5% (95% CI: 36.1% to 68.5%; Table 21). 
Table 21. Summary of Overall Best Confirmed Response based on IRC Assessment; Efficacy Analysis 
Set (MajesTEC-1 study; Cohort C, data cut-off: 16 March 2022) 
Seven responses deepened over time, from an initial response of PR or VGPR, to a best response of 
VGPR or better. Responses were ongoing for 8 of 10 subjects at the clinical cut-off. 
Subgroup Analysis of ORR  
ORR by prior anti-BCMA therapy was 55.2% (95% CI: 35.7% to 73.6%) among subjects who had 
progressed after receiving a BCMA-directed ADC and 53.3% (95% CI: 26.6% to 78.7%)) among 
subjects who had progressed after receiving a BCMA-directed CAR-T (16 March 2022 data cut-off).  
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

A similar percentage of subjects in Cohort C responded to teclistamab after prior anti-BCMA therapy, 
regardless of refractoriness to prior therapies. ORR was generally similar across other prespecified 
subgroups, but small sample sizes limits interpretation. 
Duration of Response 
With a median follow-up of 11.8 months (representing >6 months of additional follow-up) among 
responders in the All Treated Analysis set of Cohort C, median DOR (time from first response to 
disease progression or death due to any cause) was not reached. At 12 months, it was estimated that 
63.5% (95% CI: 26.0% to 85.8%) of subjects were still in response, with 4 of 21 responders (19%) at 
risk at this time point at the clinical cutoff. 
Minimal Residual Disease Negativity  
7 subjects (17.5%; 95% CI: 7.3% to 32.8%) achieved MRD negativity at 10-5. Among subjects with 
CR or better by IRC, 7 of 11 subjects (63.6%; 95% CI: 30.8% to 89.1%) achieved MRD negativity at 
10-5.

Cohort A: Patients who were triple-class exposed (PI, IMiD, and anti CD38 monoclonal 
antibody) and received ≥3 prior lines of therapy 
• 
Treatment with teclistamab will have significant anti-myeloma activity (lower 
limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for ORR is greater than 30%) 
Cohort C: Patients who have previously received ≥3 prior lines of therapy that included a 
PI, an IMiD, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and an anti-BCMA treatment (with CAR T 
cells or ADC).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly patients included in the pivotal RP2D population (N=165), all subjects treated in the study who 
were naïve to prior anti-BCMA therapy (N=302), and the All Treated Analysis Set for Cohort C (ie, 
subjects with prior anti- BCMA therapy) in Phase 2 are summarised in Table 23.  
Table 23. Summary of elderly subjects in pivotal studies with teclistamab 
In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
No biomarker test is proposed to be used for patient selection. 
Teclistamab targets BCMA, a receptor expressed on differentiated plasma cells, a subset of mature 
B cells in lymphoid tissue, and on myeloma cells. BCMA expression increases with disease progression 
and soluble BCMA in serum acts as a prognostic factor for survival and indicator for response for 
therapy. Myeloma cells express BCMA almost uniformly, level ranging from 400 to 4000 receptors/cell.

N/A 
Supportive study 
Efficacy data from phase 1 part of the study 64007957MMY1001 (MajesTEC-1) (dose 
escalation/ dose expansion) 
A total of 177 subjects received at least 1 dose of teclistamab in Phase 1 on or before the clinical cut-
off of 07 September 2021 and were included in the All Treated Analysis Set for Phase 1.  
From the All Treated Analysis Set, 74 subjects (41.8%) treated in Phase 1 have discontinued study 
participation. Sixty-five subjects (36.7%) completed the study at time of death, 6 (3.4%) withdrew 
consent, and 3 (1.7%) were lost to follow-up 
The proportion of subjects enrolled in cohorts for teclistamab IV who discontinued the study (57.1%) is 
larger than that for teclistamab SC (28.0%), commensurate with lower treatment doses evaluated for 
teclistamab IV and the fact that the first response was not observed until the tenth dose escalation 
cohort for teclistamab IV (treatment dose of 0.0384 mg/kg, with a step-up dose of 0.0192 mg/kg; see 
Section 5.4.2.1). Additionally, enrollment for teclistamab IV occurred earlier in the conduct of the 
study. A higher incidence of subjects discontinued from the study due to death in cohorts examining 
teclistamab IV (48.8%) compared with teclistamab SC (25.8%) 
As of the clinical cut-off, median duration of follow-up for all subjects treated in Phase 1 (All Treated 
Analysis Set, was 17.3 months (range: 0.4 to 45.9). Similar to the above, median duration of follow-up 
was longer for subjects enrolled in cohorts for teclistamab IV (21.4 months [range: 0.6 to 45.9]) 
compared with that for teclistamab SC (12.6 months [range: 0.4 to 24.9]). 
At least 1 subject in the following 10 cohorts had follow-up exceeding 24 months: 0.0024 mg/kg and 
0.0096 mg/kg IV Q2W; 0.0384 mg/kg, 0.0576, 0.08, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27 mg/kg IV weekly; and 0.08 
mg/kg SC weekly. Median duration of follow-up for subjects treated at RP2D in Phase 1 (All Treated 
Analysis Set,) was 12.2 months (range: 1.18 [subject died] to 18.0). 
Median follow-up in Efficacy Analysis Set was 18.2 months (range: 0.62 to 45.9) and median follow-up 
responders (per investigator) was 17.5 months (range: 5.42 [subject died] to 34.9). 
Treatment Disposition 
Overall, 112 subjects (63.3%) treated in Phase 1 (All Treated Analysis Set) have discontinued 
teclistamab as of the clinical cut-off (Table 24).

Table 24. Treatment Disposition; All Treated Analysis Set (MajesTEC-1 Study, Phase 1, data cut-off: 
07 September 2021) 
Demographics 
In the All Treated Analysis Set, the median age of subjects treated in phase 1 was 64.0 years (range: 
24 to 84), with 11.3% being at least 75 years of age. Three subjects were 80 years or older. Ninety-
five subjects (53.7%) were male and 82 (46.3%) were female.  
Most subjects (104 [58.8%]) had an ECOG score of 1 and 88 subjects (49.7%) were enrolled at sites 
in the EU (including the UK). Of the 147 subjects with baseline cytogenetic data reported, 45 (30.6%) 
had at least 1 high-risk abnormality, most commonly del(17p). Of the 174 subjects with baseline ISS 
data reported, 84 (48.3%) were ISS Stage I and 35 (20.1%) were ISS Stage III. 
Prior Systemic Therapies 
Overall, 170 of the 177 subjects treated in Phase 1 received at least 3 prior lines of multiple myeloma 
therapy. Among all subjects treated in Phase 1, the median number of lines of prior therapy was 5.0 
(range: 2 to 14). One hundred and seventy-one subjects (96.6%) were triple-class exposed (PI, IMiD, 
and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) and a majority were penta-exposed (at least 2 PIs, at least 2 
IMiDs, and at least 1 anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody; 117 subjects [66.1%]). Among all subjects 
treated in Phase 1, 83.6% has prior transplant. 
Refractory Status 
Among all subjects treated in Phase 1, 160 (90.4%) were refractory to their last line of therapy. One 
hundred-and-forty subjects (79.1%) were triple-class refractory (PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody), and 67 (37.9%) were penta-refractory (at least 2 PIs, at least 2 IMiDs, and at least 1 anti-
CD38 monoclonal antibody). Among the 40 subjects treated at RP2Din phase 1, 32 (80.0% of the 
cohort) were triple-class refractory and 16 (40.0% of the cohort) were penta-refractory. Refractory 
status in the Efficacy Analysis Set for subjects treated in phase 1 and key cohorts and was not notably 
different from that in the All Treated Analysis Set. 
Efficacy 
For dose escalation/dose expansion efficacy data, the Efficacy Analysis Set for Phase 1 included 
156 subjects who received their first dose of teclistamab on or before 18 March 2021.

Selected efficacy endpoints were analysed in the subset of these subjects who responded to 
teclistamab (PR or better). 
Efficacy results in this section are exploratory and are intended to be supportive of the primary efficacy 
analyses at pivotal RP2D.   
This section focuses on the robust efficacy results observed in Phase 1 for RP2D of 1.5 mg/kg SC 
weekly (N=40) and for 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly (N=15), which supported dose selection for RP2D. 
Efficacy results are also discussed for the dose-expansion cohort of 0.72 mg/kg IV weekly (N=15). 
In the Efficacy Analysis Set for phase 1, responses (PR or better) were seen at treatment doses of 
0.0384 mg/kg (with 0.0192 mg/kg step-up dose) IV weekly or higher, and in every SC weekly dosing 
cohort (Table 25). 
Table 25. Summary of Overall Best Confirmed Response Based on Investigator Assessment; Efficacy 
Analysis Set ((MajesTEC-1 Study, Phase 1, data cut-off: 07 September 2021) 
Responses were also observed at treatment doses of 0.0384 mg/kg IV weekly (with step-up dosing) or 
higher and 0.080 mg/kg SC weekly or higher. Responders in the lower dosing cohorts were enrolled 
earlier and thus had longer follow-up. Many responders to lower doses had durable responses with 
prolonged follow-up. However, those other dosing cohorts were smaller, limiting interpretation of 
efficacy- 
In Part 2 (dose expansion), a majority of subjects responded to treatment doses of 0.72 mg/kg IV 
weekly (ORR, 66.7%) or RP2D (ORR, 65.0%). A majority of subjects also responded to the SC dosing 
regimen of 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly (ORR, 60.0%). ORR was similar across these 3 cohorts. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 86/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All responses in the 0.72 mg/kg IV weekly cohort and most responses in the SC weekly cohorts (44 of 
45 responses) were VGPR or better. Similar results for ORR were seen among response-evaluable 
subjects in Phase 1.  
Among 10 responders in the 0.72 mg/kg IV weekly cohort, responses were maintained until the clinical 
cutoff for 7 subjects (all were ongoing responses >6 months from the first treatment dose): 2 subjects 
were alive after disease progression and 1 subject died (after disease progression). 
Among 45 responders to any SC weekly treatment dose for teclistamab, responses were maintained 
until the clinical cutoff for 32 subjects (all were ongoing responses >6 months after the first treatment 
dose): 7 subjects were alive after disease progression and 6 subjects died (3 after disease progression, 
1 died after discontinuing treatment due to an AE, and 2 after discontinuing treatment for other 
reasons). 
Duration of Response 
At treatment doses of 0.72 mg/kg IV weekly, 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly, and RP2D, respectively, 70.0%, 
66.7%, and 80.8% of responders were censored with ongoing response, resulting in median DOR that 
was not reached in these cohorts. The probability of responders remaining in response at 9 months at 
these doses was 90.0% (95% CI: 47.3% to 98.5%) for 0.72 mg/kg IV weekly, 77.8% (95% CI: 
36.5% to 93.9%) for 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly, and 87.5% (95% CI: 66.0% to 95.8%) for RP2D. 
Progression-Free Survival 
With a median follow-up of 18.2 months overall in the Efficacy Analysis Set, median PFS for 0.72 
mg/kg IV weekly was 13.9 months (95% CI: 1.0 to not evaluable) and 7 subjects (among 10 subjects 
who responded) were censored before a PFS event occurred.  
In the 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly cohort, median PFS by investigator assessment was 14.2 months 
(95% CI: 0.9 to not evaluable) and 6 subjects (among 9 subjects who responded) were censored 
before a PFS event occurred. 
At RP2D, median PFS by investigator assessment was 12.5 months (95% CI: 4.4 to not evaluable) and 
23 subjects (among 26 subjects who responded) were censored before a PFS event occurred.  
Overall Survival 
With a median follow-up of 18.2 months overall in the Efficacy Analysis Set, median OS was 18.9 
months (95% CI: 2.8 to not evaluable) for 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly; median OS was not reached for any 
other SC weekly dose or for 0.72 mg/kg IV weekly. 
3.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) application is supported by efficacy data from a single, 
uncontrolled, Phase I/II pivotal study (MMY1001; MajesTEC-1) in triple-exposed subjects with multiple 
myeloma (i.e. patients with prior exposure to at least an IMiD, a PI and an anti-CD38 mAb). The 
indication initially claimed for teclistamab was for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies including a proteasome 
inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.  
The target population on the pivotal phase 1/2 study represents a MM patient population with multi-
refractory disease and most patients were previously treated with several (median of 5 previous) lines 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 87/144 
 
 
 
 
of therapies. The CHMP however requested that the indication proposed by the applicant should be 
revised to better reflect the patient population of the pivotal study. The enrolled patient population was 
largely triple refractory, had demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy and was treated 
with teclistamab monotherapy. The Applicant modified the teclistamab indication to monotherapy for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at 
least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-
CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
Dose response was evaluated as a part of the pivotal phase 1/2, study. The dose of 1.5 mg/kg SC 
weekly (termed as pivotal RP2D) achieved exposure consistently above the EC90.  
One limitation of the study is the single-arm design, since the phase 1/2 study was conducted without 
an active control arm. Because there is no standard treatment for these patients, the missing control 
arm may therefore be considered acceptable. Single arm study setting always brings uncertainties to 
efficacy assessment and contextualisation of the results. Concerns regarding single arm study setting 
in relation to patient population were discussed in Scientific advice procedures during clinical 
development. On a general level, the CHMP agreed that patients with relapsed and/or refractory 
multiple myeloma who are triple-class exposed to PI, IMiD and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody 
represent a population with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options.  
ORR has been selected as primary endpoint for the Phase II part of study MMY1001: this is acceptable 
considering the exploratory nature of the trial and the significant rate of refractoriness expected in the 
study population. Additional measures of depth of response (VGPR or better/CR or better/sCR/MRD 
negative rates) have also been included to further characterise the extent of cytoreduction with 
teclistamab. The use of the 2016 IMWG response criteria is in line with current guidelines (see e.g. 
Dimopoulos MA et al, Multiple myeloma: EHA-ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, 
treatment and follow-up Ann Oncol 2021, and the NCCN guidelines for multiple myeloma, v 5.2022) 
and endorsed. 
The relevance of ORR to inform clinical benefit evaluations is, however, per se, limited, and robust 
demonstrations of durable responses are needed to conclude for clinical benefit. In this regard, 
however, reliable interpretations of PFS and OS data, which are the most relevant clinical endpoints to 
support B/R evaluations in RRMM, are not possible in the absence of proper controls. The importance 
of sufficient follow-up time and characterisation of duration of response (DOR) is, therefore, 
emphasised and exposure times should be sufficient to cover the projected exposure periods in clinical 
practice. 
The applicant also included PROs analyses using the EORTC QLQ-C30, EQ-5D-5L and PGIS instruments 
to investigate changes from baseline in HR-QoL, symptoms and functional parameters. HR-QoL is of 
pivotal importance for patients with relapsed and refractory MM, since the burden of both disease 
symptoms and treatment-related toxicity can be considerable. PROs evaluation in an uncontrolled, 
open-label study is, however, of limited value, since it is not possible to exclude with reasonable 
certainty that relevant bias (e.g. the positive impact of concomitant treatments aimed at improving 
symptoms) are present. 
The patient population included is a combination of high-risk disease features, high number of prior 
lines of therapy, high proportion of patients refractory to other treatment options, but with good 
performance status and of relatively young age. Although exclusion of patients with significant 
comorbidities is understood from the safety perspective, the criteria applied selected mostly healthy 
patients, and thus information on tolerability of the treatment in a less fit, older patient population is 
currently limited. Only patients with a baseline ECOG PS score of 0 or 1 could be enrolled in study 
MMY1001. It is noted that the inclusion of subjects with an ECOG PS of 2 was advised by the CHMP 
Assessment report

(see e.g. EMA/SA/0000050045) to increase results generalisability to frailer patients. To adequately 
describe the enrolled patient population, this information is now included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Sample size calculations for Cohorts A and C in study MMY1001 are formally correct and acceptable. 
The clinical relevance of the assumed ORR thresholds to claim efficacy, especially for Cohort A (i.e. 
ORR 30%), is however uncertain when the currently available alternatives in advanced MM are taken 
into account (e.g. the ORR is 67% with idecabtagene vicleucel in the ITT population, and 32% and 
25.3% with belantamab mafodotin and selinexor, respectively, in a more pre-treated population). 
In line with the early, exploratory nature of study MMY1001, the applicant has made several, important 
amendments to the original study, the most important one being introducing Part 3 (Phase 2) to the 
initially planned phase 1 study and replacing the originally proposed iv administration with SC dosing 
instead. While this continuum is most likely due to a rationale to speed up the development 
programme of teclistamab, a phase 2 study with a more carefully considered, prespecified and treated 
(SC) patient population would have been a more preferred solution. 
The applicant has also included an explorative cohort to study the efficacy of teclistamab in patients 
with a previous anti-BCMA treatment (antibody-drug or CAR-T cell) in addition of being at least triple-
exposed. Considering the higher unmet medical need of these patients, results from Cohort C are 
considered of value to further support the possible benefit of the immediate availability of teclistamab 
through a CMA. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-response studies in a relapsing/remitting condition such as MM should take into consideration 
both depth and duration of response as the main efficacy variables to inform dose selection. In this 
regard, it is agreed that, compared to what observed at the RP2D, the limited available data with lower 
dose regimens (e.g. 0.72 mg/kg/weekly s.c.) showed a similar ORR (60%) yet with a trend towards 
reduced response duration. On the other hand, efficacy data with doses higher than 1.5 mg/kg/weekly 
are limited, especially with respect to the 6 mg/kg sc regimens.  
Published data (see e.g. Chen H et al, Leuk Res 2019) highlighted how the binding of anti-BCMA 
antibodies to target cells might be negatively impacted by high serum BCMA (sBCMA) levels. Lower 
response rates were observed in the pivotal study in patients with the highest baseline sBCMA levels 
(e.g. ≥ third quartile) when compared to patients with lower baseline sBCMA levels: ORR by IRC was 
26.8% (95%CI 14.2, 42.9) vs. 75.2% (95%CI 66.5, 82.6), sCR+CR rate 17.1% (95%CI 7.2, 32.1) vs. 
46.3% (95%CI 37.2, 55.6). However, PK data did not show a similar effect in terms of teclistamab 
clearance. The applicant pointed out how subjects in the high baseline sBCMA subgroup were more 
likely to have features associated with high tumour burden, such as presence of plasmocytoma (36.6% 
vs. 9.9% in the “higher” and “lower” sBCMA subgroups, respectively), massive bone marrow 
plasma cell infiltrate (≥60% 20.5% vs. 7.6%, respectively) and advanced ISS stage (stage III 30% 
vs. 6.7%, respectively). Whether high sBCMA levels should be regarded as generally prognostic or 
predictive of teclistamab efficacy cannot be answered in the absence of controlled data. The applicant 
is thus recommended to further investigate the impact of sBCMA on teclistamab PK, PD and efficacy in 
the ongoing/planned phase III studies 
The most updated results (16 March 2022 data cut-off) from patients who received teclistamab at the 
RP2D in the pivotal trial showed an ORR of 63.0% (95% CI: 55.2% to 70.4%), which can be 
considered of clinical relevance when contextualised in the current treatment landscape. With the limits 
of such indirect comparisons in a heterogeneous condition such as MM, the ORR in study MMY1001 
compared favourably with the results observed with selinexor and dexamethasone (ORR 25.3%), 
belantamab mafodotin (ORR 32%) and is in line with idecabtagene vicleucel (ORR 67.1% in the ITT 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 89/144 
 
 
 
 
population) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (ORR 84%) in advanced settings of relapsed and refractory 
MM. Several subgroups analyses were performed for the ORR with no clear differences in responses, 
except in patients with extramedullary disease. 
The most updated VGPR or better rate (58.8%, 95% CI: 50.9% to 66.4%), CR or better rate (39.4%, 
95% CI: 31.9% to 47.3%) and MRD negativity rate with teclistamab (26.7%; 95% CI: 20.1% to 
34.1%)are also considered of interest in such advanced disease setting. It is unclear, however, to what 
extent teclistamab, being a bispecific antibody, can interfere with immunofixation assays that are 
required to confirm CR in MM. Since teclistamab is a modified IgG lambda antibody, interference with 
immunofixation assays could not be excluded. However, CR was adjudicated in a similar fraction of 
subjects with IgG kappa and IgG lambda M protein, although time to CR was slightly longer for 
subjects with IgG lambda MM. This finding would suggest that the interference of teclistamab in the 
assessment of CR by immunofixation might be limited, yet the small sample size does not allow for 
definitive conclusions. The Applicant is recommended to further evaluate the possible interference of 
teclistamab in immunofixation techniques.  
Subgroup analyses showed that the activity of teclistamab in study MMY1001 was overall consistent 
irrespectively of age, sex, renal function, ECOG PS score, extent of refractoriness, serological type of 
MM and cytogenetic risk class. Limited numbers in subgroups do not allow, however, for definitive 
conclusions. It is noticed, however, how a possible trend towards a reduced activity of teclistamab (in 
terms of both rate/depth of response and response duration) was observed in subgroups defined by 
measures of increased disease burden (e.g. in subjects with higher ISS stage or with increased bone 
marrow plasma cells). Limited information is available to address this issue: no data on the effect of 
higher doses of teclistamab in subjects with high MM burden was available, and the relative weight of 
tumour burden and sBCMA levels on the observed reduction of teclistamab activity could not be 
disentangled due to the limited sample size and the absence of controlled data. Additional data from 
the ongoing phase III studies are needed to further understand the role of measures of tumour burden 
on teclistamab efficacy and the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen for all subjects in the 
claimed indication. 
This MAA for teclistamab is supported by a single, uncontrolled pivotal trial. Considering the limited 
sample size and the lack of control, it is important to note that response rates were consistent across 
all regions/sites.  
Duration of response is essential for demonstration of clinical benefit. At the time of the initial 
submission, median DOR was not estimable with 80.9% of responders censored in the Efficacy Analysis 
Set (N=150). With a median follow-up of 14.1 months (representing >4 months of additional follow-
up) as of the updated clinical cutoff, median DOR for subjects treated at pivotal RP2D (All Treated 
Analysis Set) was 18.4 months (95% CI: 14.9 to NE) with 68.3% of responders censored. The 12-
month DOR rate was estimated to be 68.5% 
At the time of the initial submission, median PFS was 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.0 to NE) in the Efficacy 
Analysis Set (N=150). With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, median PFS based on IRC assessment 
was 11.3 months (95% CI: 8.8 to 17.1 months). The estimated PFS rate at 12 months was 48.3% 
(95% CI: 40.0% to 56.0%). 
Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study intervention to 
the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For 
participants who have not progressed and are alive, data were censored at the last disease evaluation 
before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. However, according to the EMA guideline 
(Appendix 1 to the guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man. Methodological 
consideration for using progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS) in confirmatory 
trials, EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1), “informative” censoring should be taken into account. A 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 90/144 
 
 
 
sensitivity analysis was performed to address this issue. This analysis considers 13 additional subjects 
to have had a PFS event compared with the initial analysis, 11 of whom had discontinued treatment. 
By this more conservative definition, median PFS was 9.8 months (95% CI: 6.9 to 12.5 months). The 
estimated PFS rate at 12 months was 43.8 % (95% CI: 36.0% to 51.4%). 
With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, median OS based on IRC assessment was 18.3 months (95% 
CI: 15.1 months to NE) and not yet mature. 
The provided MRD data suggest that most of the CR/sCR responses are deep which is important. From 
the pooled MRD data from the literature, even in the last line treatment, it seems that with deeper 
responses at least the DOR could be improved. With a median follow-up of 14.1 months (representing 
>4 months of additional follow-up), 44 subjects (26.7%; 95% CI: 20.1% to 34.1%) achieved MRD 
negativity at 10-5. ). Among subjects with CR or better by IRC, 30 of 65 subjects (46.2%; 95% CI: 
33.7% to 59.0%) achieved MRD negativity at 10-5.  
The study included an additional independent cohort of (Cohort C) 38 participants who had also 
received prior anti-BCMA targeted therapy. The updated ORR for 40 evaluable patients was 52.5% 
(95% CI: 36.1% to 68.5%) and prior ADC was 55.2% (95% CI: 35.7% to 73.6%) and 53.3% (95% 
CI: 26.6% to 78.7%) among receiving a prior BCMA-directed CAR-T. The median DOR was 11.8 
months.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The demonstration of efficacy relies on one pivotal single arm study.  This poses well known limitations 
with regards to interpretation of data, in particular with regards to assessment of time to event 
endpoints. These uncertainties will be addressed by results from the ongoing Phase III study 
(MMY3001; MajesTEC-3) investigating the efficacy of teclistamab in combination with sc. daratumumab 
vs. investigator’s choice (DPd or DVd) in adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in an earlier 
treatment stage (i.e. 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy including lenalidomide and a PI). Although the study 
enrols a less heavily pre-treated patient population, and teclistamab is administered in combination 
with daratumumab, the study is considered adequate to address this issue and provide relevant data 
on PFS (primary endpoint) and OS. Completion of this study is expected in Q1 2028. 
The pivotal study MajesTEC-1 is currently on-going. Although additional follow-up data as requested by 
the CHMP (most recent data cut-off 16 March 2022) have been provided during the procedure, long-
term efficacy and safety cannot yet be comprehensively characterised, and the final CSR of the study 
MajesTEC-1 will be provided.  
3.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data submitted in this MAA support the benefit of teclistamab in the final agreed 
indication.

context of a conditional MA:

combination with sc. daratumumab vs. investigator’s choice (DPd or DVd) in adults with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma should be provided. 
In addition, it is recommended that the Applicant further evaluates the possible interference of 
teclistamab in immunofixation techniques.  
3.3.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In total, safety data are provided for 342 subjects who received at least 1 dose of teclistamab 
monotherapy by 16 March 2022. Primary safety data are summarised for 165 subjects on the pivotal 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; 1.5 mg/kg teclistamab SC administered weekly, with the first 
treatment dose preceded by step-up doses of 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg) in MajesTEC-1, who received their 
first dose of teclistamab by 16 March 2022.  Supportive safety data are presented for 137 subjects 
treated with other subcutaneous (SC) teclistamab doses (i.e., non-RP2D [n=53]) or with intravenous 
(IV) teclistamab (n=84) in Phase 1 of MajesTEC-1, as well as for 40 subjects in Cohort C of MajesTEC-
1 Phase 2 (i.e., subjects having received a prior anti-BCMA therapy), who received their first dose of 
teclistamab before the clinical cut-off. The maximum dose explored with SC dosing has been 6 mg/kg 
teclistamab weekly for 2 cycles, then biweekly, and then monthly after 6 cycles. 
The “Total All Treated Analysis Set”, includes 302 subjects on pivotal RP2D, SC non-RP2D, or IV 
treatment but excludes Cohort C subjects. 
In addition to the 342 subjects in MajesTEC-1, 54 subjects have been treated with teclistamab in 
combination with daratumumab SC with and without pomalidomide in Study 64407564MMY1002 
(TriMM-2), 39 subjects have been treated with teclistamab in combination with talquetamab and 
daratumumab in Study 64007957MMY1003 (RedirecTT-1), and 42 subjects have been treated in the 
platform study 64007957MMY1004 (MajesTEC-2). Apart from an integrated assessment of all 
hepatobiliary events, no safety data from these other studies exploring combination therapies has been 
provided for assessment. 
In the All Treated Analysis Set, median age was 64.0 years (range: 24 to 84), with 39 subjects 
(12.9%)  
≥75 years old; 165 subjects (54.6%) were male and 137 (45.4%) were female. The median time from 
diagnosis to enrolment in the study was 6.4 years (range: 0.5 to 26.2). Apart from 6 subjects not 
previously exposed to an anti-CD38 antibody, all 302 subjects were triple-class exposed (prior PI, prior 
IMiD, and prior anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody), and 207 subjects (68.5%) were penta-exposed (at 
least 2 prior PIs, at least 2 prior IMiDs, and at least 1 prior anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody). The 
median number of lines of prior therapy was 5 (range: 2 to 14). Two hundred forty-nine subjects 
(82.5%) had prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 
In the RP2D group, median age was 64.0 years (range: 33 to 84), with 24 subjects (14.5%) ≥75 years 
old; 96 subjects (58.2%) were male and 69 (41.8%) were female. The median time from diagnosis to 
enrolment in the study was 6.0 years (range: 0.8 to 22.7). All 165 subjects (100.0%) were triple-class 
exposed (prior PI, prior IMiD, and prior anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody), and 116 subjects (70.3%) 
were penta-exposed (at least 2 prior PIs, at least 2 prior IMiDs, and at least 1 prior anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody). The median number of lines of prior therapy was 5 (range: 2 to 14). One 
hundred thirty-five subjects (81.8%) had prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Table 28. Treatment Disposition in MajesTEC-1; All Treated Analysis Set, data cut-off: 16 March 2022 
The median duration of study treatment for the total All Treated Analysis Set was 7.1 months (range: 
0.03 to 40.87). One hundred sixty-five subjects (54.6%) received teclistamab monotherapy for at least 
6 months, 124 subjects (41.1%) for at least 9 months, 93 subjects (30.8%) for at least 12 
months,35 subjects (11.6%) for at least 18 months, and 17 subjects (5.6%) for at least 24 months. 
The median relative dose intensity for all study treatment, including step-up doses, was 95.9% for the 
total All Treated Analysis Set. 
In the RP2D group, the median duration of treatment was 8.5 months (range: 0.2 to 24.4). Ninety-
eight subjects (59.4%) received teclistamab monotherapy for at least 6 months, 79 subjects (47.9%) 
for at least 9 months, 58 subjects (35.2%) for at least 12 months, 10 subjects (6.1%) for at least 18 
months, and 1 subject (0.6%) for at least 24 months. Subjects received a median of 10 treatment 
cycles (range: 1 to 29; cycle duration for RP2D was 21 days in Phase 1 and 28 days in Phase 2). The 
median relative dose intensity for all study treatment, including step-up doses, was 93.7%.  
The study protocol for MajesTEC-1 allowed investigators to adjust study treatment in response to 
treatment toxicity using cycle delay, dose reduction, and dose interruption (i.e., delay within a cycle 
and dose skips). In the total All Treated Analysis Set, cycle delays were reported in 169 subjects 
(56.0%), dose delays in 52 subjects (17.2%), and dose skips in 185 subjects (61.3%). Dose 
reductions were reported for 4 subjects (1.3%) for any reason, 1 of whom was receiving pivotal RP2D, 
2 of whom were receiving SC non-RP2D, and 1 of whom received IV treatment. In the RP2D group, 
cycle delays were reported in 96 subjects (58.2%), dose delays in 24 subjects (14.5%) and dose skips 
in 117 subjects (70.9%). AEs were the most frequently cited reason for cycle delays and both types of 
dose interruption. The nature of AEs leading to treatment modifications are discussed in Section 
2.6.8.8.

 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
At least 1 serious TEAE was reported for 190 subjects (62.9%) in the total All Treated Analysis Set, 
and for 107 subjects (64.8%) in the RP2D group. In the RP2D group, the most frequently involved 
SOC was Infections and Infestations (40.6%). A summary of the most frequently reported serious 
TEAEs is provided in Table 32.

Deaths 
For the total All Treated Analysis Set, 132 subjects (43.7%) had died as of the clinical cut-off, with 
disease progression cited as the primary cause of death for most subjects (84 subjects [27.8%]) 
(Table 34).

Table 34. Summary of Deaths and Cause of Death in MajesTEC-1; All Treated Analysis Set 
In the RP2D group, 68 subjects (41.2%) had died as of the clinical cut-off. According to investigator 
assessment of primary cause of death, 41 subjects (24.8%) died due to disease progression, 19 
(11.5%) died due to AE, and 8 (4.8%) died due to other causes. Of the 19 deaths due to an AE, 12 
were a result of COVID-19. In total, 18 Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in subjects treated at pivotal 
RP2D who died due to AE: COVID-19 (12 subjects) and pneumonia, haemoperitoneum, pneumonia 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

streptococcal, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, hepatic failure, and hypovolaemic shock in 
one subject each. The events of hepatic failure, pneumonia streptococcal, progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, and one event of COVID-19 were judged by the investigator as possibly or 
probably related to teclistamab. The investigator-assessed relationship to teclistamab is missing for 
one subject who experienced a Grade 5 TEAE of COVID-19. 
Disease progression was also the most common cause of death in the SC non-RP2D and IV groups. 
Four Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in subjects treated at SC non-RP2D doses who died due to AE: 
COVID-19, pneumonia, sepsis, general physical health deterioration, and myelodysplastic syndrome. 
The events of COVID-19 and myelodysplastic syndrome were judged by the investigator as possibly 
related to teclistamab. Six Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in subjects treated at IV doses who died due 
to AE: COVID-19 (3 subjects) and pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, and respiratory failure in one 
subject each. The event of pneumonia was judged by the investigator as possibly related to 
teclistamab. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity events were anticipated events in the MajesTEC-1 
study based on the mechanism of action of teclistamab, specifically the activation of T cells. Multiple 
myeloma as a disease state is associated with cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinemia, and an increased 
risk of infection. Other adverse events of clinical interest relate to administration of teclistamab and 
include systemic administration-related reactions (sARRs) and injection-site reactions. 
•  Cytokine release syndrome 
The MajesTEC-1 protocol required administration of specific premedication, comprising steroids, 
antipyretics (paracetamol) and antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists), before one or more doses of 
study treatment in all subjects (ie, required prior to each step-up dose, the first treatment dose, and 
for subsequent doses following prespecified AEs). The observed frequencies and severities thus largely 
reflect occurrence of CRS despite the use of premedication. 
The main characteristics of CRS in the R2PD group are summarised in Table 35.

Assessment report

Page 103/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The protocol for MajesTEC-1 provided guidance for management of CRS with specific recommendations 
for the use of tocilizumab and corticosteroids based on the severity of presenting symptoms. However, 
the guidance was not prescriptive, and management was ultimately based on physician discretion and 
standard of care at the investigational site. The use of supportive measures to treat CRS is replicated 
in Table 36.

Table 36. Number of Subjects Receiving Supportive Measures to Treat CRS; All Treated Analysis Set 
(Study 64007957MMY1001) 
The characteristics of CRS events in the SC non-RP2D and IV groups were generally similar to the 
RP2D group. 
•  Neurologic adverse events and neurotoxicity 
A “neurologic adverse event” was defined as any TEAE reported in either the Nervous System 
Disorders or Psychiatric Disorders SOC, regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment. 
“Neurotoxicity” was a neurologic AE judged by the investigator to be causally related to teclistamab.

Immune effector cell – associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) 
Per the ASTCT definition, ICANS is “a disorder characterised by a pathologic process involving the central 
nervous  system  following  any  immune  therapy  that  results  in  the  activation  or  engagement  of 
endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Symptoms or signs can be progressive 
and may include aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, motor weakness, 
seizures,  and  cerebral  edema.”  ICE  score  data  required  for  formal  identification  of  ICANS  was  only 
collected  in  Phase  2  of  MajesTEC-1,  but  data  for  subjects  treated  at  pivotal  RP2D  in  Phase  1  were 
retrospectively evaluated for neurotoxicity events and neurologic AEs for events that would be clinically 
consistent with ICANS. The characteristics of ICANS events are summarised in Table 39. The reported 
individual  symptoms  of  ICANS  included  dysgraphia  and  confusional  state,  aphasia,  dyscalculia, 
disorientation, and mental status changes. Most ICANS events were concurrent with CRS (i.e., during or 
within 7 days of CRS resolution).

Peripheral neuropathies 
As of the updated clinical cutoff, there were 26 subjects who experienced at least 1 peripheral 
neuropathy. Of these, 17 subjects experienced maximum Grade 1 events, 8 experienced maximum 
Grade 2 events, and 1 subject experienced a maximum Grade 3 event. None of these TEAEs led to 
interruption of teclistamab treatment and only 1 (the maximum Grade 3 event) worsened over time. 
•  Cytopenias 
Cytopenias were among the most frequently reported TEAEs for subjects treated in MajesTEC-1. The 
characteristics of cytopenias reported as TEAEs for the total All Treated Analysis Set and for the RP2D 
group are summarised in. Cytopenias were frequently managed with myeloid growth factors, platelet 
transfusions and transfusions with packed red blood cells.

Table 40. Number of Subjects with Treatment-emergent Cytopenic Adverse Events by MedDRA 
Preferred Term, and Maximum Toxicity Grade of 3 or Higher in MajesTEC-1; All Treated Analysis Set 
In total, there were 154 subjects (93.3%) treated at pivotal RP2D who had at least 1 laboratory finding 
of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or lymphopenia. The events were considered 
prolonged in 109 subjects (66.1%). This incidence was driven primarily by lymphopenia (86 subjects 
[52.1%]), while prolonged neutropenia and prolonged thrombocytopenia were reported in 17.6% and 
7.9% of subjects, respectively. Median duration of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were similar 
(25.5 and 22.0 days, respectively), while that for lymphopenia was longer (39.0 days). 
Haemorrhagic TEAEs were reported for 29 subjects (17.6%) with most having a maximum severity of 
Grade 1 or Grade 2. Higher grade haemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 6 subjects.

•  Hypogammaglobulinemia 
The incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia was assessed based on both AE reporting by investigators 
(i.e., the grouped term hypogammaglobulinemia, which included the preferred terms 
hypogammaglobulinemia, blood immunoglobulin G decreased, and hypoglobulinemia), as well as by 
clinical laboratory data (where hypogammaglobulinemia was defined as a postbaseline IgG 
value <500 mg/dL). As seen in Table 41 hypogammaglobulinemia, was identified for the majority of 
subjects based on clinical laboratory criteria.

• 
Infections 
For the total All Treated Analysis Set, TEAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported for 
226 subjects (74.8%), with Grade 3 or 4 infections reported for 96 subjects (31.8%). Grade 5 
infections were reported for 21 of 28 subjects who had AE identified as their primary cause of death by 
investigators, including 15 subjects with Grade 5 COVID-19.

In the RP2D group, treatment-emergent infections were reported for 126 subjects (76.4%). The 
following infections of any grade were reported for ≥5% of subjects: 
Maximum Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported for 60 subjects (36.4%) in the RP2D group, with the 
following treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 infections reported in ≥2% of subjects: 
For subjects treated at pivotal RP2D, 21 (12.7%) experienced Grade ≥3 neutropenia or febrile 
neutropenia concurrently or within 2 weeks prior to a Grade ≥3 infection. A similar proportion (23 
subjects [13.9%]) experienced a Grade ≥3 infection within 4 weeks of Grade ≥3 neutropenia or febrile 
neutropenia. 
Serious infections were reported for 67 subjects (40.6%) in the RP2D group, and Grade 5 infections 
were reported for 15 of 18 subjects with AE cited by investigators as the primary cause of death. These 
fatal infections included COVID-19 (12 subjects) and pneumonia, pneumonia streptococcal, and 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (1 subject each). 
Overall, COVID-19 (as a grouped term including COVID-19, asymptomatic COVID, suspected COVID, 
COVID-19 pneumonia, and SARS-COV-2 positive) was reported for 44 subjects (14.6%) in the total All 
Treated Analysis Set. The maximum severity of COVID-19 was Grade 3 or higher for most subjects, 
and Grade 5 COVID-19 was reported for 16 subjects. 
Opportunistic infections were reported for 19 subjects (6.3%) in the total All Treated Analysis Set. A 
summary of opportunistic infections by pathogen origin is displayed in Table 42.

In the total All Treated Analysis Set, oral herpes was reported in 9 subjects (3.0%), and herpes zoster 
in 4 subjects (1.3%); in the RP2D group, oral herpes was reported in 4 subjects (2.4%), and herpes 
zoster in 2 subjects (1.2%). Prophylactic antiviral medication for herpes was prescribed for 88.4% of 
subjects in the total All Treated Analysis Set, and for 92.7% of subjects in the RP2D group. 
A case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was also reported in a patient more than a 
year after initiation of treatment with teclistamab.   
• 
Immune-mediated adverse events 
Any grade immune-mediated TEAEs were reported for 6 subjects (2.0%) in the total All Treated 
Analysis Set; all were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. In the RP2D 
group, Grade 2 immune-mediated lung disease was reported in two subjects, with Grade 2 immune-
mediated arthritis and Grade 1 immune-mediated enterocolitis reported in one subject each. In the SC 
non-RP2D group, Grade 2 immune-mediated enterocolitis was reported in one subject, and in the IV 
Assessment report

group, one subject was reported with Grade 3 immune-mediated arthritis and Grade 2 immune-
mediated lung disease. 
According to the applicant, PK exposure in these subjects was comparable with other subjects who 
received the same teclistamab dose. 
•  Tumour lysis syndrome 
One case of Grade 3 tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), considered a serious event and judged by the 
investigator to be very likely related to teclistamab, was reported in the RP2D group. The subject had 
no clinical symptoms and TLS was diagnosed by the site based on elevated uric acid results only 
(potassium and phosphate levels were normal). TLS was not reported for subjects who received SC 
non-RP2D or IV treatment. 
•  Second primary malignancies 
For the total All Treated Analysis Set, 13 subjects (4.3%) experienced second primary malignancies 
after median follow-up of 16.3 months (range: 0.26 [subject died] to 49.4). 
•  Adverse events associated with administration of teclistamab 
In the total All Treated Analysis Set, 6 subjects (2.0%) experienced Grade 1 (4 subjects [1.3%]) or 
Grade 2 (2 subjects [0.7%]) treatment-emergent systemic administration-related reactions (sARRs). 
Four of these subjects received IV treatment, while 2 subjects (1.2%) treated at pivotal RP2D 
experienced sARRs. In the RP2D group, the first subject experienced Grade 1 tongue swelling 
associated with Step-up Dose 1, and the second subject experienced recurrent Grade 1 pyrexia 
associated with doses at Cycle 3 Day 8, Cycle 7 Day 1, and Cycle 7 Day 8. Median sARR duration was 1 
day (range: 1 to 2), and all sARR events resolved. 
In the RP2D group, a total of 148 injection-site reactions were reported for 60 subjects (36.4%). These 
comprised injection site erythema in 43 subjects (26.1%), injection site pruritus in 13 subjects (7.9%), 
and injection site rash in 10 subjects (6.1%). The maximum severity was Grade 1 for 52 subjects 
(31.5%) and Grade 2 for 8 subjects (4.8%). Median time from last dose of study treatment to 
injection-site reaction onset was 2 days (range: 1 to 11). Median duration was 4 days (range: 1 to 
328); out of the 148 injection-site reactions, 136 reactions were reported as resolved as of clinical cut-
off, 2 reactions were resolving, and 10 reactions were not resolved. Eighteen subjects (10.9%) 
received supportive treatment for injection-site reactions: topical steroids were administered for 15 
subjects (9.1%) and antihistamines for 6 subjects (3.6%). Eight of 60 subjects treated at pivotal RP2D 
who experienced an injection-site reaction had at least 1 atopy/allergy condition in their medical 
history. 
•  Dose-limiting toxicities 
Two subjects experienced dose-limiting toxicities during the dose escalation portion (Phase 1) of 
MajesTEC-1; the events were Grade 4 delirium and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, reported for 1 subject 
each. Both subjects received treatment with IV teclistamab, with the day of onset and onset dose 
being reported as day 3 / 20 ug/kg for delirium, and day 9 / 180 ug/kg for thrombocytopenia. The 
events resolved upon study drug discontinuation and interruption, respectively. 
 Laboratory findings 
Summaries of worst toxicity grade for haematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory values 
collected during treatment is provided for the total All Treated Analysis Set and the RP2D group in 
Table 43 and Table 44, respectively.

Haematology 
Worsening postbaseline shifts of 1 to 2 toxicity grades were commonly observed, but on the level of 
mean values, trends were limited to transient decreases in lymphocytes, platelets and haemoglobin at 
early stages of treatment. 
Blood chemistry 
A seen in Table 43 and Table 44 Grade 1 to 2 toxicity was commonly observed for many chemistry 
analytes, but Grade 3 to 4 toxicity was relatively infrequent. There were no clinically relevant changes 
in mean chemistry values over time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

Coagulation 
In Phase 1 of MajesTEC-1, coagulation was assessed at screening, at each step-up dose, at the 
first 2 treatment doses, and as clinically indicated thereafter (including if a subject developed CRS). In 
Phase 2, coagulation was assessed at screening and as clinically indicated thereafter (including if a 
subject developed CRS). As seen in Table 43 and Table 44, Grade 3 abnormalities were infrequent, and 
Grade 4 worsening was not observed. 
An analysis of the 302 subjects treated in MajesTEC-1 who were naïve to prior anti-BCMA identified 
two subjects who experienced laboratory Grade 3 elevation in aPTT and 4 who experienced Grade 3 
laboratory hypofibrinogenemia. No DIC and bleeding events were reported in these subjects. Four of 
the 6 subjects had either aPTT prolongation or hypofibrinogenemia concurrently with CRS or within 15 
days after CRS events. One subject had Grade 3 decreased fibrinogen with concurrent Grade 3 
adenovirus infection. One subject experienced Grade 3 increased aPTT on Study Day 8 without 
concurrent CRS or infection. The majority of the laboratory events occurred in the context of CRS. 
Overall, 5 of the 6 subjects with Grade 3 hypofibrogenemia or aPTT prolongation were associated with 
CRS or infection. No clinical events of bleeding or thrombosis were associated with these events, 
though Grade 2 DIC was reported as a symptom of CRS for a subject enrolled in the 0.18 mg/kg 
teclistamab IV cohort in Phase 1. 
 Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from participation in MajesTEC-1. According to the 
applicant, there were no reports of pregnancy or breastfeeding during the study. 
Safety in elderly patients 
No notable trends were seen in an analysis of age-relevant adverse events (Table 45).

 Immunological events 
Among subjects who received the Pivotal Recommended Phase 2 Dose 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous weekly 
(RP2D), 150 subjects were ADA evaluable with at least 1 post-dose ADA sample at data cut-off. Of 
these subjects 79 and 9 subjects had evaluable ADA data at ≥6 months and ≥1 year after the first dose 
of study treatment. None of them (0%) were identified as positive for antibodies to teclistamab. 
Among subjects who received SC non-RP2D in Phase 1, 53 subjects were ADA evaluable with at least 1 
post dose ADA sample, and 19 and 13 subjects had evaluable ADA data at ≥6 months and ≥1 year

after the first dose of study treatment. One of these subjects was identified as positive for ADA at the 
end of treatment. No PK data were collected for the subject at or after the end of treatment to allow 
assessment of the effect of ADA on teclistamab PK.  
Among subjects who received RP2D in Cohort C in Phase 2, 35 subjects were ADA evaluable with at 
least 1 post dose ADA sample, and 10 subjects had evaluable ADA data at ≥6 months after the first 
dose of study treatment. None of these 35 subjects were identified as positive for ADAs 
Among the 82 subjects treated with teclistamab IV who were ADA evaluable (31 and 21 subjects had 
evaluable ADA data at ≥6 months and ≥1 year after the first dose, respectively), one subject was 
identified as positive for antibodies to teclistamab. The PK parameters for this subject were comparable 
to those for ADA negative subjects. 
Overall, 238 subjects receiving teclistamab SC were ADA evaluable. One of these subjects (0.4%) 
developed antibodies to teclistamab. The detected ADAs were neutralizing and of low-titer. 
No serum sample collected during a CRS event was identified to be positive for antibodies to 
teclistamab, indicating a lack of correlation between CRS and immunogenicity.  
No serum sample collected during a sARR event was identified to be positive for antibodies to 
teclistamab in the 5 subjects who experienced sARR. 
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with teclistamab. 
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Within the total All Treated Analysis Set, 13 subjects (4.3%) experienced TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
• 
• 
In the RP2D group, 2 subjects (1.2%) discontinued treatment, one due to Grade 3 adenoviral 
pneumonia that was considered by the investigator as very likely related to teclistamab, and 
one due to Grade 4 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy that was considered by the 
investigator as probably related to teclistamab. 
In the SC non-RP2D group, 3 subjects (5.7%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The first 
subject discontinued treatment due to congestive cardiac failure, pleural effusion, and viral 
pneumonia, all considered unrelated to teclistamab by the investigator. The second subject 
discontinued treatment due to myelodysplastic syndrome, considered possibly related to study 
drug. The third subject discontinued study drug due to rectal haemorrhage, considered 
unrelated to study drug by the investigator. 
• 
In the IV group, 8 subjects (9.5%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Three subjects 
discontinued treatment due to multiple TEAEs; the first subject discontinued treatment due to 
cellulitis, sepsis, urinary tract infection, bone pain, and depressed level of consciousness. The 
second subject discontinued treatment due to nephropathy and proteinuria. The third subject 
discontinued treatment due to immune-mediated lung disease and immune-mediated arthritis. 
Two subjects (2.4%) discontinued treatment due to plasma cell leukaemia, and the following 
TEAEs each led to treatment discontinuation for 1 subject (1.2%): pneumonia, respiratory 
failure, and delirium. Immune-mediated lung disease, immune-mediated arthritis, and delirium 
were considered related to study drug by the investigator.

Within the total All Treated Analysis Set, 4 subjects (1.3%) experienced TEAEs leading to dose 
reduction. The reported TEAEs leading to dose reduction in those subjects were: neutropenia (Grade 
4), nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea (in one subject), muscular weakness and diarrhoea. 
The occurrence of AEs frequently led to treatment modifications (cycle delays, dose delays and dose 
skips). Overall, cycle delays were reported in 169 subjects (56.0%), dose delays in 52 subjects 
(17.2%), and dose skips in 185 subjects (61.3%) in the total All Treated Analysis Set, with AEs being 
the most frequently cited reason for all categories. In the RP2D group, at least 1 TEAE leading to cycle 
delay or dose interruption (dose delay or dose skip) was reported in 123 subjects (74.5%). These 
events were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (84 subjects [50.9%]) 
and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (63 subjects [38.2%]). The following TEAEs led to cycle 
delay or dose interruption in ≥2% of subjects in any SOC: 
 Supportive safety information 
Supportive Safety Data for Subjects in Cohort C in Phase 2 
The applicant provided interim safety data for 40 subjects enrolled in Cohort C in Phase 2 of 
MajesTEC-1; subjects in Cohort C are required to have received prior anti-BCMA therapy. 
At the time of the latest data cut-off of 16 March 2022, seventeen subjects (42.5%) are still on 
treatment. Rason for discontinuation was reported as progressive disease in 14 subjects (35.0%) and 
death in 7 subjects.  
Subjects in Cohort C received teclistamab for a median of 5.2 months (range: 0.2 to 13.6). Nineteen 
subjects (47.5%) received teclistamab for at least 6 months and 11 subjects (27.5%) received 
teclistamab for at least 9 months. Nineteen subjects (47.5%) were treated for at least 6 cycles and 16 
(40.0%) were treated for at least 9 cycles. Median relative dose intensity was 99.7% in Cycle 1 and 
94.2% in Cycle 2+. Median relative dose intensity for all treatment, including step-up doses, was 
95.9% for all subjects treated in Cohort C. 
Cycle delays occurred in 13 subjects (32.5%) treated in Cohort C. Dose interruption (dose delay[s] and 
dose skip[s]) occurred in 6 subjects (15.0%) and 25 subjects (62.5%), respectively. AE was the most 
frequently reported reason for cycle delays and both types of dose interruption. 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

TEAEs were reported for 40 subjects (100%) treated in Cohort C. Serious TEAEs were reported for 
24 subjects (60.0%). Maximum Grade 3 TEAEs were reported for 9 subjects (22.5%) and maximum 
Grade 4 TEAEs were reported for 20 subjects (50.0%). No subjects experienced dose reduction or a 
TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. TEAEs leading to cycle delay or dose interruption (dose 
delay and dose skip) were reported in 29 subjects (72.5%). 
Eight subjects (20.0%) experienced Grade 5 TEAEs. Six of the 8 subjects with Grade 5 TEAEs had AE 
identified by the investigator as the primary cause of death. Grade 5 TEAEs for these 6 subjects 
included COVID-19 (2 subjects) and cardiac arrest, coronary artery dissection, sudden death, and 
cardiac failure (1 subject each). The event of cardiac arrest was judged by the investigator as possibly 
related to teclistamab. The other 2 Grade 5 TEAEs were acute kidney injury and multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome in subjects for whom progressive disease was reported as the primary cause of 
death. 
The most frequently reported individual TEAEs of any severity grade (≥20%) were: 
At least 1 Grade 3 or 4 TEAE was reported for 37 subjects (92.5%) in Cohort C. Grade 3 or 4 events 
were most frequently reported in the SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (34 subjects 
[85.0%]) and Infections and Infestations (12 subjects [30.0%]), with the following events occurring in 
≥10% of subjects in any SOC: 
No individual infection other than COVID-19 (3 subjects [7.5%]) was reported as Grade 3 or 4 in more 
than 1 subject. 
A total of 44 events of any-grade CRS were reported in 26 subjects (65.0%). The maximum severity 
grade by ASTCT criteria was Grade 1 in 21 subjects (52.5%) and Grade 2 in 5 subjects (12.5%). Most 
events occurred during step-up or Day 1 of Cycle 1; median time to onset from last injection of

teclistamab was 2 days (range: 2 to 6), and median duration was 2 days (range: 1 to 4). All CRS 
events were reported as resolved. Supportive measures to treat CRS were used in 23 subjects 
(57.5%), including tocilizumab in 12 subjects (30.0%). 
Neurologic TEAEs were reported in 21 subjects (52.5%), with the following reported in more than 
1 subject: headache (9 subjects [22.5%]); ICANS and insomnia (4 subjects [10.0%] each); peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (3 subjects [7.5%]); encephalopathy (2 subjects [5.0%], a grouped term 
including preferred terms of depressed level of consciousness and memory impairment in 1 subject 
each); and dizziness and motor dysfunction (2 subjects [5.0%] each). Grade 3 or 4 neurologic AEs 
included Grade 3 ICANS reported in 1 subject (2.5%) and Grade 3 spinal cord compression (reported 
term: spinal cord compression due to myeloma bone disease) reported in 1 subject (2.5%). Serious 
neurologic AEs included the Grade 3 ICANS and spinal cord compression events noted above, and 
Grade 2 psychomotor retardation that was considered unrelated to teclistamab. 
Neurotoxicity events (i.e., neurologic AEs judged by the investigator as related to study treatment) 
were reported for 10 subjects (25.0%), with headache (5 subjects [12.5%]), and ICANS (4 subjects 
[10.0%]) reported for more than 1 subject. All neurotoxicity was Grade 1 or Grade 2 severity, except 
for the subject with serious Grade 3 ICANS. 
Among the 4 subjects with ICANS, maximum ICANS severity was Grade 1 in 3 subjects and Grade 3 in 
1 subject. All ICANS events were concurrent with CRS, and no subjects discontinued treatment due to 
ICANS. Median time to onset from last injection of teclistamab was 2.5 days (range: 2 to 4), and 
median duration was 1.5 days (range: 1 to 2). All ICANS events were reported as resolved. Supportive 
measures to treat ICANS were used in 2 subjects, with both of these subjects receiving tocilizumab. 
Cytopenias were reported for 35 subjects (87.5%). Maximum Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia were reported in 67.5% (n=27), 50.0% (n=20), 45.0% (n=18), 
and 45.0% (n=18) of subjects, respectively. When considered as individual preferred terms, 5 subjects 
(12.5%) experienced serious TEAEs in SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, including 
3 subjects (7.5%) with febrile neutropenia and 2 (5.0%) with anaemia. Haemorrhagic events were 
reported for 5 subjects (12.5%), one of which was Grade 2 haematuria. 
At least 1 any grade treatment-emergent infection was reported for 26 subjects (65.0%). The 
infections reported in more than 1 subject were COVID-19 (5 subjects [12.5%]); bronchitis (4 subjects 
[10.0%]); pneumonia (3 subjects [7.5%]); and cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, implant site 
infection, laryngitis, oesophageal candidiasis, pharyngitis, viral pneumonia, rhinitis, tooth infection, and 
urinary tract infection (2 subjects [5.0%] each). Ten subjects experienced maximum Grade 3 or 4 
infections, with no individual preferred term reported in more than 1 subject; 2 subjects died of 
COVID-19. Infections were reported as serious in 10 subjects (25.0%). No subjects discontinued 
treatment due to infection. 
Opportunistic infections were reported for 7 subjects (17.5%), with the following events reported in >1 
subject: cytomegalovirus infection reactivation and esophageal candidiasis (2 subjects each). The 
following event terms were each reported in 1 subject: Adenovirus infection, Adenovirus reactivation, 
Aspergillus infection, BK virus infection, Human herpesvirus 6 infection, and Human herpesvirus 
6 infection reactivation. No fatal infections were classified as opportunistic. 
Immune-mediated TEAEs or TLS were not reported. A second primary malignancy was reported for 
1 subject (2.5%); this was a breast lesion, considered a ductal carcinoma in situ, that was diagnosed 
on Day 145. The investigator considered this event to be doubtfully related to teclistamab. As of Day 
226, the subject was continuing on teclistamab; the breast lesion was reported as not resolved. 
As of the clinical cut-off, 17 subjects (42.5%) treated in Cohort C had died (Table 46). Of the total 
deaths (n=17), 6 (15.0% of all subjects treated in Cohort C) occurred within 60 days of the first dose

of teclistamab. During this time period, 3 subjects (7.5%) died due to progressive disease, 1 subject 
died due to COVID-19 (reported as an AE), 1 subject died due to cardiac failure (reported as an AE), 
and 1 subject died due to coronary artery dissection (reported as an AE). 
At least 1 serious TEAE was reported for 24 subjects (60.0%) treated in Cohort C. Serious events were 
most frequently reported in the SOC of Infections and Infestations (10 subjects [25.0%]). The 
following serious TEAEs were reported in more than 1 subject in any SOC: COVID-19 (4 subjects 
[10.0%]); CRS and febrile neutropenia (3 subjects [7.5%] each); and anaemia (2 subjects [5.0%]). 
Serious TEAEs considered by the investigator as related to teclistamab included the following: CRS, 
COVID-19, adenovirus infection; cytomegalovirus infection reactivation; bacterial pneumonia; viral 
pneumonia; Moraxella infection, febrile neutropenia, cardiac arrest, pyrexia, pain in jaw, and ICANS. 
Within the events considered as related to teclistamab, CRS was reported for 3 subjects (7.5%), and 
all others reported for 1 subject each (2.5%).

Table 46. Summary of Deaths and Cause of Death in MajesTEC-1 Cohort C; All Treated Analysis Set 
Integrated analysis of hepatobiliary events 
Based on new hepatobiliary events reported as of the updated clinical cut-off, an investigation was 
performed into hepatobiliary events observed in subjects treated in MajesTEC-1 as well as other 
subjects treated with teclistamab in combination with other therapies in other ongoing studies being 
conducted by the Applicant. 
Data from MajesTEC-1 
In the pivotal RP2D group, TEAEs of ALT increased, AST increased, ALP increased, and 
hyperbilirubinemia were reported for 20 subjects (12.1%), 15 subjects (9.1%), 18 subjects (10.9%), 
and 7 subjects (4.2%), respectively, treated at pivotal RP2D. The majority of these events were Grade 
1 and Grade 2. Grade 3 or 4 ALT increased, AST increased, and ALP increased, were each reported for 
3 subjects (1.8%), and Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia was reported for 2 subjects (1.2%). Other 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were GGT increased in 5 subjects (3.0%), cholestasis in 2 subjects (1.2%); and 
hepatic cytolysis and hepatitis acute in 1 subject (0.6%) each. One Grade 5 event of hepatic failure 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022

was reported. The event of Grade 5 hepatic failure occurred on in a subject who had previously 
developed Grade 4 acute hepatitis and which had resulted in study drug interruption. Both the events 
of hepatic failure and acute hepatitis were considered possibly related to teclistamab by the 
investigator. This case also met Hy’s law criteria.  
Anther subject met laboratory criteria for drug-induced liver injury and developed Grade 3 
hyperbilirubinemia, with Grade 3 AST elevation and Grade 1 ALT elevation. The subject also 
experienced TEAEs of Grade 1 fever, Grade 2 anorexia, Grade 3 pain in the left lower extremity, Grade 
3 bacteremia, Grade 3 cellulitis, and Grade 2 Clostridium difficile colitis. The criteria were not met for 
Hy’s law given the ongoing sepsis and other infectious complications and concurrent medications 
capable of causing the observed injury. 
The incidence of worsening of laboratory abnormalities for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and bilirubin from 
baseline (any grade) in subjects receiving pivotal RP2D was 34.5%, 40.6%, 43.0%, 38.2%, and 8.5%, 
respectively. Most of these were Grade 1 and Grade 2, and <5% of these events were Grade 3 and 
Grade 4 for all events except GGT (9.1%). 
According to the Applicant, analysis of the time course of ALT elevation and association with CRS 
revealed that a majority of ALT elevations occurred in the first cycle or early Cycle 2. This pattern is 
consistent with the occurrence of CRS. Most of ALT/AST elevations were under the context of CRS. 
In the SC Non RP2D group, no subjects potentially met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s law. In the IV 
group, one subject potentially met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s law from Study Days 141 to 161. 
This subject also experienced TEAEs of Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia and Grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia 
over the same study period. 
Global Safety Database 
As of 16 March 2022, 668 subjects have been treated with teclistamab from multiple ongoing studies. 
A search of the Global Safety Database for teclistamab (cumulative to 16 March 2022), which included 
all ongoing clinical studies, identified 20 cases (including 1 case of HLH [preferred term: 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]) of hepatic function abnormalities. 
Nine cases involved biliary disorders (cholecystitis [4 subjects]; cholecystitis acute [3 subjects]; and 
cholangitis and obstructive pancreatitis [1 subject each]). All cases had underlying conditions 
(eg, cholelithiasis, polyps in the gallbladder) and/or an alternative etiology which provided a more 
plausible explanation for the TEAEs. In the remaining 11 cases (6 non-fatal and 5 fatal), the 6 non-
fatal cases included 2 cases (hyperammonemia [history of encephalopathy] and hyperbilirubinemia) in 
the context of disease progression, including 1 with liver involvement; 3 cases (1 hepatitis B 
reactivation, 1 hepatitis E infection, and 1 liver abscess) where the etiology of the events may be 
different from drug-induced liver injury and likely due to an infectious process, and 1 case of hepatic 
cytolysis consistent with a pattern of liver injury associated with CRS (2 days after Step-up Dose 2 of 
teclistamab). 
The 5 fatal cases included 3 fatal hepatic failure cases: 2 fatal cases were due to hepatic failure (1 of 
which had an additional preferred term of hepatitis acute) and 1 fatal case was due to disease 
progression. In the remaining 2 fatal cases, the fatality was due to hepatitis B reactivation and HLH.

3.3.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data available for teclistamab stem from the ongoing MajesTEC-1 study, in which a total of 
342 subjects have been exposed to teclistamab monotherapy. Of these, 165 subjects have been 
exposed to the proposed registrational dosage (termed “recommended Phase 2 dose” [RP2D]), and the 
maximum dose explored with SC dosing has been 6 mg/kg (administered weekly for 2 cycles, then 
biweekly, and then monthly after 6 cycles). 
Notably, MajesTEC-1 is a single-arm trial, and there is thus no concurrent control group against which 
the safety profile could be compared, which limits a comprehensive assessment.  
Median duration of follow-up in the RP2D group was 14.1 months, and median duration of treatment 
was 8.5 months, with 42% of subjects remaining on treatment. Some dosage modifications, most 
commonly due to an AE, were required in a substantial proportion of subjects in the RP2D group. On 
the other hand, treatment discontinuation due to an AE was rare, being required in only two subjects 
in the RP2D group, which would support the view that dosage modifications are an efficient means to 
manage emerging tolerability issues. The nature of AE’s requiring treatment modifications was 
consistent with the general safety profile of teclistamab, the most common reasons being neutropenia, 
CRS and infections. The modification guidelines provided for the RP2D group in the MajesTEC-1 study 
are reflected in the SmPC, and this is endorsed. 
The most common TEAEs were in the System Organ Classes Blood and lymphatic system disorders, 
General disorders and administration site conditions, Immune system disorders, Gastrointestinal 
disorders and Nervous system disorders. CRS was the most commonly observed individual TEAE and 
was reported in over 70% of subjects in the RP2D group; in the Applicant’s data displays, the 
individual symptoms of CRS have been excluded for subjects in whom CRS was diagnosed and this is 
considered acceptable. Haematological TEAEs, including neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and 
lymphopenia were also commonly reported. Other common events included fatigue, pyrexia, headache 
and GI symptoms. Injection site erythema occurred on SC administration in over 20% of subjects. 
Within the initially provided documentation, the applicant described the process of determining adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) for labelling purposes based on the pivotal RP2D group. The methodology 
applied was endorsed by the CHMP, which however requested, an additional analysis from the 
applicant in the All Treated Analysis Set (302 patients). No additional ADRs were identified based on 
the analysis in the All Treated Analysis Set; a statement to this effect has been added in Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  Grade 3 prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and Grade 3 fibrinogen 
decrease were observed in 2.9% and 2.4% of subjects, respectively, in the RP2D cohort. Moreover, 
lower grade INR increased, aPTT prolongation or hypofibrinogenemia occurred very frequently in the 
MajesTEC-1 study, even in contexts other than CRS and infections (one subject with Grade 3 increased 
aPTT on Study Day 8 without concurrent CRS or infection). Therefore, INR increased, aPTT 
prolongation and fibrinogen decreased should be included in the SmPC as ADRs.  
As could be expected based on the mechanism of action, cytokine release syndrome was observed in a 
high proportion of subjects receiving teclistamab. These events were mostly Grade 1 or 2, mostly 
occurred during the early stages of treatment, were generally of a transient nature (median duration 
was 2 days), and there were very few cases of recurrent events that were worsening over time or 
cases with first occurrence beyond first Treatment Dose. Overall, the observed characteristics support 
a view that CRS occurring in the context of teclistamab use is manageable with diligent care. 
In MajesTEC-1, the use of premedication was mandated according to a specific scheme provided in the 
protocol. The same scheme has been brought forward into the SmPC, and in light of the high 
frequency of CRS, the routine use of premedication is endorsed. Supportive measures, including the 
use of tocilizumab, were used for management of CRS in a substantial proportion of subjects. While 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 126/144 
 
 
 
the guidelines provided in the MajesTEC-1 protocol for management of CRS were not prescriptive, it is 
particularly noted that tocilizumab was used as part of the treatment measures in 36% of all subjects 
(and over 50% of subjects requiring any supportive measures for treatment of CRS). Treatment 
guidelines for CRS consistent with those provided in the MajesTEC-1 protocol are included in the 
Product Information for teclistamab (see SmPC section 4.2).     
Overall, the nature and characteristics of CRS reported with teclistamab portray a profile that seems 
less severe than that reported e.g. with CAR-T therapies. However, it is also noted that the profile is 
contingent on routine use of premedication, and that in MajesTEC-1, the use of supportive measures 
appears to have been relatively liberal (particularly with many subjects with Grade 2 CRS having been 
treated with tocilizumab). As the occurrence of CRS events is quite heavily concentrated into the early 
stages of therapy, the precautions regarding intensified monitoring, as currently proposed in the 
SmPC, are endorsed and that a monitoring recommendation of 48h after each dose in the Step-up 
dosing schedule is sufficient. To further minimise this risk, applicant will ensure that all patients treated 
with teclistamab will received a Patient Card in order to inform them about the risks of CRS and when 
to when to seek urgent attention from the healthcare provider or seek emergency help, should signs 
and symptoms of CRS occur. Additional safety information on this risk will be collected through the 
planned randomised study comparing teclistamab to other treatments used in relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma. The ongoing pivotal trial will also further characterise the long-term safety 
associated with teclistamab use.  
The potential for neurotoxicity is a recognised safety concern for immune effector cell – activating 
therapies, and neurological AEs were observed in a high proportion of subjects. Most of the events 
were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, the most common individually reported AE being headache. 
Neurotoxicity events (i.e. neurologic AEs attributable to teclistamab) were reported in some 13% of 
subjects treated at RP2D, the most common event also in this category being headache. Grade 1 to 2 
ICANS was observed in 3% of subjects treated at RP2D. 
Similar to CRS, the events were mostly of limited duration, but supportive treatment including 
tocilizumab was used in most subjects developing ICANS; this should be noted in the context of most 
of the ICANS events occurring concurrently with CRS. As such, the inclusion of treatment guidelines for 
neurotoxicity, including potential ICANS, in the Product Information for teclistamab, is supported. The 
guidelines proposed by the applicant are consistent with those provided in the MajesTEC-1 protocol, 
and the inclusion of this evidence-based treatment scheme also in the PI for teclistamab is endorsed. 
Within the Nervous system disorders SOC, any Grade peripheral neuropathies were reported with very 
common frequency in 26/165 subjects (16%), and Grade ≥3 in one subject (0.6%). Despite the 
prevailing understanding that its expression is limited to haematopoietic cells, BCMA appears to have a 
role in neural development, as reported by Osorio et al (Osorio et al. Mol Cell Neurosci 2014). In 
addition, BCMA seems to be expressed in the CNS as well as in the peripheral neural tissue (Mohyddin 
et al. Clin Rev Oncol 2021). Whether bispecific antibodies can cross the blood-brain remains unclear, 
but BCMA expression on basal ganglia may be a plausible explanation for the peripheral neuropathies 
observed with “very common” frequency after teclistamab, as a possible BCMA off-target toxicity. 
Therefore, newly diagnosed and/or worsening peripheral neuropathies and extrapyramidal symptoms 
with teclistamab should continue to be monitored in the ongoing clinical trials and in the post-
marketing setting. 
Cytopenias were among the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (neutropenia 66%, 
anaemia 51%, thrombocytopenia 38% and lymphopenia 34%) and were clinically managed through 
standard of care. Although cytopenias can be considered known risks related to the underlying clinical 
condition, a potential role of teclistamab cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, considering that the SmPC 
already considers neutropenia within the Warnings/Precautions section of the SmPC and neutropenia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 127/144 
 
 
 
thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia are also included as ADRs in the SmPC, additional precautions or 
other measures were not considered necessary. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia is not an uncommon observation in MM patients. Thus, due to confounding 
caused by the underlying disease, assessment of a potential contributory role of teclistamab is 
complicated by the absence of a concurrent control group. Nevertheless, teclistamab is expected to 
reduce B cells which may lead to new onset or worsening hypogammaglobulinemia, eventually 
resulting in an increased risk of serious infections. However, as hypogammaglobulinemia is included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC and is reported as an ADR in section 4.8, it is agreed that specific additional 
precautions ae not required. It is furthermore noted that in the SmPC, patients are recommended to be 
treated according to local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions, antibiotic or antiviral 
prophylaxis, and administration of immunoglobulin replacement. 
Patients with MM have increased infectious liability due to their underlying condition, and a high rate of 
infectious complications is therefore not unexpected. A substantial proportion of the most severe 
infections resulted from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which probably has resulted in a very 
dynamic and constantly evolving situation as regards serious infectious complications. Due to the 
absence of a control group, no robust conclusions can be made. 
Opportunistic infections were reported in 7.9% of subjects (n=13) in the RP2D cohort). Pathogens 
included Pneumocystis jirovecii, adenovirus, aspergillus, BK virus, cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B. A 
Grade 3 event of adenoviral pneumonia led to treatment discontinuation. The low frequency of herpes 
viral infections likely results from the vast majority of subjects using prophylactic antiviral medication. 
The SmPC section 4.4 includes a recommendation to consider antiviral prophylaxis prior to starting 
teclistamab. 
The reported case of PML, with a probable relationship to teclistamab, is potentially concerning. 
Whereas PML is known to sometimes occur in patients with haematological malignancies, it is also an 
adverse reaction known to be associated with many immunomodulatory drugs. Considering the severe 
nature of PML, treating physicians should be vigilant in monitoring for early signs of potential PML, and 
a specific mention of PML in the Infections subsection of SmPC Section 4.4 has been included. In the 
All Treated Analysis Set, 2.0% of subjects (n=6; n=4 in the pivotal RP2D group) experienced TEAEs 
classified as immune-mediated. In the RP2D group, Grade 2 immune-mediated lung disease was 
reported in two subjects, with Grade 2 immune-mediated arthritis and Grade 1 immune-mediated 
enterocolitis reported in one subject each. In the SC non-RP2D group, Grade 2 immune-mediated 
enterocolitis was reported in one subject, and in the IV group, one subject was reported with Grade 3 
immune-mediated arthritis and Grade 2 immune-mediated lung disease. All events were considered by 
the investigators to be related to teclistamab and most of them were associated with treatment 
discontinuation and/or with clinical sequelae. In these subjects, PK exposure seems to be comparable 
with other subjects who received the same teclistamab dose. From in vitro specificity study, 
teclistamab demonstrated the specificity of T cell activation (except at concentrations >100 nM) and 
did not cause activation of T cells in the absence of target BCMA cells+. However, at the moment and 
in the absence of controlled data, a potential role of teclistamab on immunological activation related to 
lymphocytes’ activation mediated by the non-specific binding with CD3+ molecules cannot be ruled 
out. The Applicant should continue to monitor immune-mediated toxicity in the ongoing clinical trials 
and in the post-marketing setting. 
One patient who received teclistamab at pivotal RP2D experienced Grade 3 TLS, diagnosed on the 
basis of elevated uric acid. Signs and symptoms of TLS should be monitored, and events managed 
according to standard guidelines. The Applicant will continue to monitor TLS in the ongoing clinical 
studies and in the post-marketing setting, inclusion of TLS as an ADR in the SmPC is currently not 
warranted.

The incidence of second primary malignancies in MM patients has been reported to be between 0.5% 
and 5% with a latency period of >12 months (Areethamsirikul et al, Leukemia and Lymphoma. 2015). 
The times from initiation of teclistamab to diagnosis are relatively short in many of the reported cases, 
rendering any causal association less likely. For the myelodysplastic syndrome, a time to onset of 
approximately one year could be considered more plausible, but the risk of secondary myelodysplastic 
syndrome is also known to be generally elevated in MM patients. Overall, based on current evidence, it 
can be agreed that the reporting rate of second primary malignancies in MajesTEC-1 is consistent with 
medical literature. 
Systemic administration-related reactions were overall uncommon, and their risk is likely mitigated by 
the premedication mandated by the MajesTEC-1 protocol. Local injection site reactions were relatively 
common, but mostly comprised transient mild erythema. 
As of the updated clinical cut-off, 41.2% of RP2D subjects participating in MajesTEC-1 had died. 
Progressive disease was the most commonly reported cause of death, accounting for 60% of reported 
deaths in the RP2D group. Among AEs reported as the primary cause of death, COVID-19 was the 
most common event. 
For the total All treated Analysis Set, 132 subjects (43.7%) had died, with “disease progression” 
reported as the primary cause of death for most subjects (n=84, 27.8%). Differences in the 
percentages of subjects who died due to disease progression could be related to differences in the 
duration of follow up between the different groups, particularly in subjects who received IV treatment 
early in dose escalation in Phase 1. The higher frequency of death related to disease progression within 
30 days of last dose of teclistamab in the RP2D set of the pivotal study could be related to 
corresponding differences in baseline characteristics. 
For the reported non-fatal serious TEAEs, the most common individual events were COVID-19, 
pneumonia and CRS, reported in 14.5%, 10.3% and 8.5% of RP2D subjects, respectively. Overall, no 
unexpected characteristics or clustering of events are seen among the reported deaths or non-fatal 
serious TEAEs. 
Changes in haematological parameters are commonly observed in MM patients, and in the absence of a 
control group, the relative effect of teclistamab vs. disease-associated changes cannot be robustly 
assessed. While decreases in neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts and haemoglobin 
concentration were observed in a high proportion of subjects, changes on the level of mean values 
were limited to transient effects on lymphocyte and platelet counts and haemoglobin concentration. 
Although Grade 1 to 2 abnormalities in clinical chemistry parameters were common, there were no 
clinically meaningful changes on the level of mean values. One case of fatal hepatic failure, meeting 
the formal criteria of Hy’s law, was reported. 
A separate investigation into hepatobiliary events that had occurred in MajesTEC-1 as well as other 
studies being conducted with teclistamab was undertaken. In total, 20 cases of hepatic function 
abnormalities, of which five were fatal, were identified in the Applicant’s global safety database. The 
five fatal cases included three fatal hepatic failure cases: two fatal cases were due to hepatic failure (1 
of which had an additional preferred term of hepatitis acute) and one fatal case was due to disease 
progression. In the remaining two fatal cases, the fatality was due to hepatitis B reactivation and 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. While no obvious alternative aetiology was present for the acute 
hepatitis leading to fatal hepatic failure (which also formally met the criteria of Hy’s law), confounding 
factors and alternative aetiologies are present for the majority of cases. Furthermore, most of the 
transaminase elevations associated with teclistamab occur in the context of CRS. As such, whereas the 
reported case of Hy’s law warrants careful continued attention to hepatobiliary events, it can be agreed 
that in the absence of any identifiable mechanistic basis for direct hepatotoxicity, this monitoring 
currently can be performed within the context of the multiple manifestations of CRS.

Although the sample size for subjects with previous exposure to anti-BCMA therapy (Cohort C) is still 
limited, the currently available safety data is consistent with that observed in the wider RP2D group, 
although it is noted that the only currently reported case of Grade 3 ICANS occurred in a subject within 
this cohort. At the present time, no specific precautions in this patient group beyond the general 
principles outlined in the SmPC are considered necessary. 
Over the course of Study MajesTEC-1, the overall incidence of antibodies to teclistamab was low, with 
all ADA-positive subjects (a total of 2) having low titers. No effect of immunogenicity on safety, 
including sARR and CRS was seen and there was no observable effect of ADA formation on 
pharmacokinetics or clinical efficacy.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
As duration of exposure to teclistamab and corresponding follow-up of patients in MajesTEC-1 is 
relatively short further data from subsequent data lock-points are expected in order to further 
characterise the long-term safety of teclistamab and the important identified risks associated with its 
use.  This includes the final CSR for MajesTEC-1 which is expected to be available by the end of 2028.  
Additional safety data for the known important identified risks with teclistamab, will be required from 
the ongoing comparative MajesTEC-3 study which will support eventual conversion to a full MA for 
Tecvayli. 
3.3.7.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of teclistamab monotherapy, when used in the management of MM patients, has 
been studied in a single-arm trial. The total number of subjects studied to date enables a reasonable 
characterisation of the overall safety profile and common adverse events, but the lack of a concurrent 
control group limits a comprehensive assessment. 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of teclistamab, CRS was observed in over 70% of all subjects 
receiving RP2D teclistamab and can indeed be considered its key risk. It is however noted that CRS 
appeared to be transient in nature, mostly low-grade severity, and was manageable with diligent 
patient care. The inclusion of specific treatment guidelines for CRS, similar to those applied in the 
pivotal trial, in the Product Information together with the provision of a patient card to directly inform 
patients when to seek medical is expected to adequately minimise this risk. Provided information will 
also the management of ICANS (which often occurs concurrently with CRS). For other identified risks 
(such as cytopenias and infections), it is considered that treatment modification guidelines in the 
Product Information for teclistamab are sufficient.

context of a conditional Marketing Authorisation:

this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
4.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
4.1.  Therapeutic Context 
4.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is submitting a Marketing Authorisation Application for consideration of conditional 
approval of teclistamab as monotherapy for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a 
proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody 
Treatment guidelines for MM do not give specific recommendations after multiple relapses, and 
treatments are chosen individually based on patient and disease characteristics and prior treatments. 
Although response rates and durations generally decline after several lines of treatment, patient 
populations are better defined by refractoriness to available treatments rather than number of 
therapies received. Generally, patients can be considered to have limited treatment options when they 
are refractory to an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody, and 
exhausted effective treatment options when they are penta-refractory, defined as being refractory to 
two immunomodulatory agents, two PIs and an anti-CD38 antibody. In addition, patients with a 
previous BCMA-targeting therapy represent the last line setting in the current therapeutic landscape. 
4.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need. 
Much progress has been made over the past decade in the understanding of myeloma disease biology 
and individualised treatment approaches. Several new classes of drugs have joined the traditional 
armamentarium (corticosteroids, alkylating agents and anthracyclines) and, along with high-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 135/144 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, have led to deeper and durable clinical 
responses. 
Due these achievement survival outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have also 
significantly improved over the past 15 years.  The introduction of novel classes of drugs [proteasome 
inhibitors (PIs) (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib), immunomodulatory imide agents (IMiDs) 
(thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide) and lately targeted therapies, such as monoclonal 
antibodies targeting CD38 (daratumumab) and SLAMF7 (elotuzumab) have enabled numerous 
combinations in the treatment armamentarium of MM. However, almost all patients with multiple 
myeloma eventually relapse and the remission duration in relapsed multiple myeloma decreases with 
each regimen. 
With the approval of daratumumab and its wide use in combinations in earlier lines of MM treatment, a 
new population of patients is created who have become refractory to all available agents (including 
daratumumab). This population can be referred to as triple-class refractory MM and it encompasses 
those patients with disease refractory to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and 1 anti-CD38 mAb (such as 
daratumumab). 
Therefore, an unmet medical need persists particularly in patients pre-treated with daratumumab, and 
new mechanisms of action are needed to overcome drug resistance. However, both Blenrep 
(belantamab mafodotin, a BCMA-targeting antibody-drug), Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) and 
Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) (CAR t-cell products targeting BCMA) were recently authorised in 
patients who have previously received at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory 
agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Thus, a new last line RRMM patient population now also 
includes treatment with a BCMA-targeting treatment. 
4.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is derived from a single phase 1/2 study 64007957MMY1001 
(MajesTEC-1). This was open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teclistamab 
monotherapy (1.5 mg/kg SC administered weekly with the first treatment dose preceded by step-up 
doses of 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg) in RRMM patients. The pivotal population with regard to efficacy are the 
subjects treated at RP2D in phase 1 and subjects treated in Cohort A in phase 2 (n=165) with previous 
exposure to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and 1 anti-CD38 mAb. 
Supportive efficacy data, especially supporting the efficacy in patients also with previous BCMA-
targeting treatment, is provided from Cohort C. 
4.2.  Favourable effects 
The ORR according to the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria as 
assessed by the IRC was 63.0% (95% CI: 55.2% to 70.4%). The median DOR for subjects treated at 
pivotal RP2D (All Treated Analysis Set) was 18.4 months (95% CI: 14.9 to NE). 
A best response of VGPR or better as assessed by the IRC was reported for 58.8% (95% CI: 50.9% to 
66.4%) of subjects and sCR was reported for 32.7% (95% CI: 25.6% to 40.5%) of subjects. 
The median time to response was 1.18 months (range: 0.2, 5.5), and the median time to best 
response (PR or better) was 3.79 months (range 1.1; 16.8). 
The median PFS and OS based on IRC assessment were 11.3 months (95% CI: 8.8 to 17.1 months) 
and 18.3 months (95% CI: 15.1 months to NE) respectively

4.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy assessment relies on a single arm study, conducted without an active control arm. This poses 
well know limitations with regards to interpretation of data, in particular with regards to selection bias 
and assessment of time to event endpoints. Patient population defined by the proposed indication, 
adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody, are currently eligible for 
other treatments. The presented results are considered compelling in this setting, and will be further 
confirmed in a randomised confirmatory study MMY3001 (MajesTEC-3). 
Subjects in the pivotal study were generally fit  and elderly patients were underrepresented. Subjects 
with active CNS involvement or with clinical signs of meningeal involvement by MM were excluded from 
trial participation, as well as patients with plasma cell leukaemia. The activity of teclistamab in these 
rare subsets of MM is unknown. The low percentage of subjects with severe MM signs/symptoms (e.g. 
anaemia, renal failure, hypercalcaemia) is in line with the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, yet raises 
uncertainties of the generalisability of results in study MMY1001 to the target population. 
4.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in all subjects, with at least one Grade 3 to Grade 
4 event reported in over 90% of subjects in the RP2D group. These were most frequently reported in 
the Blood and lymphatic system disorders and Infections and infestations SOCs. 
In the RP2D group, the most frequently reported TEAEs included CRS (72%), neutropenia (71%), 
anaemia (52%), thrombocytopenia (40%), lymphopenia (34%), injection site erythema (26%), 
diarrhoea (28%), fatigue (28%), nausea (27%), pyrexia (27%), and headache (24%). Cytopenias and 
infections were the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs. 
At least 1 event of any grade CRS was reported in 73% of subjects treated at pivotal RP2D. Most 
events occurred during the step-up stage of dosing. Median time to onset was 2 days, and median 
event duration was 2 days. CRS was frequently managed with supportive measures, including 
tocilizumab in over 50% of subjects requiring any supportive measures for treatment of CRS. No Grade 
4 or 5 CRS was observed. 
In the RP2D group, 14.5% of subjects experienced treatment-emergent neurotoxicity. One Grade 4 
seizure was reported; other events had a maximum toxicity of Grade 1 or 2. The most common event 
was headache, reported in 8.5% of subjects. Grade 1 to 2 ICANS was reported in 3% of RP2D 
subjects. In addition, one subject in Cohort C experienced Grade 3 ICANS. 
Cytopenic events were reported in the majority of subjects. In the RP2D group, Grade 3 to 4 
neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia were reported in 64%, 37% and 21% of subjects, 
respectively. There was one case of Grade 5 haemoperitoneum in a subject with Grade 2 
thrombocytopenia at baseline. 
In the RP2D group, treatment-emergent infections were reported in 76% of subjects, and Grade 3 to 4 
infections in 36% of subjects. The most common Grade 5 infection was COVID-19. 
4.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The key uncertainty is related to the nature of the MajesTEC-1 study; it is a single-arm study, and the 
absence of a concurrent control group in a heavily pre-treated patient population with multiple disease-
associated complications severely limits the ability to robustly assess the safety profile of teclistamab.  
Despite the updated analyses submitted during the assessment, the limited duration of treatment and 
follow-up still complicate assessment of longer-term effects for a treatment that is foreseen to continue 
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 137/144 
 
 
 
until disease progression. The uncertainty is particularly pertinent related to effects that have a high 
underlying prevalence in the relevant patient population, i.e. cytopenias and infections. The long-term 
safety profile of teclistamab will be further characterised through the ongoing MajesTEC-1 study and 
additional information will be collected through the randomised phase 3 study MMY3001 (MajesTEC-3).  
The overall size of the safety population, and particularly that of Cohort C, remains limited.

4.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
4.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The use of the teclistamab as a single-agent therapy demonstrated a clinically meaningful antitumour 
activity. With the limits of naïve indirect comparisons in a heterogeneous condition such as MM, the 
ORR of 63.0% is higher than what has been observed with other agents in similar patient populations: 
32% ORR with recently approved belantamab mafodotin, and 26.2% with selinexor in combination with 
dexamethasone, and comparable to CAR T products idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene 
autoleucel. Despite recent approvals of these products, limited treatment alternatives are available in 
these heavily pre-treated RRMM patients.  
Observed high ORR in this last line of treatment is considered potentially relevant, providing a new 
alternative with a new MoA in the current therapeutic landscape of MM. The revised indication wording 
is considered to adequately reflect the last line patient population included in the pivotal study.  
sCR rate of 32.7% and CR or better rate of 39.4% is considered high in a heavily pre-treated RRMM 
population. The updated data demonstrate that responses can continue to deepen with prolonged 
treatment.

Based on currently available data, the key risk associated with teclistamab is CRS. In general, it seems 
that CRS events can be managed firstly, with appropriate premedication being used for overall CRS 
risk mitigation, and secondly, with due vigilance particularly at the early stages of therapy and active 
use of supportive measures. The SmPC includes management guidelines for CRS that are consistent 
with those used in MajesTEC-1, which together with the additional risk minimisation measures included 
in the RMP are considered sufficient to minimise this risk. 
The high underlying prevalence of infections and cytopenias in MM patients complicates the 
assessment of any contributory role of teclistamab for these complications; moreover, the infection 
profile is confounded by the highly dynamic COVID-19 landscape during the conduct of MajesTEC-1. 
While no outstanding safety concerns can currently be identified, a more comprehensive assessment in 
this respect will have to await results from controlled studies. 
The limited follow-up and the overall limited size of the database also pose uncertainties particularly 
for assessment of very rare events such as PML and also hepatobiliary events; as such, the safety 
profile of teclistamab may still be evolving but will be further characterised through the ongoing 
MajesTEC-1 study and the randomised phase 3 study MajesTEC-3. 
4.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The study population were heavily pre-treated and had received at least three prior therapies (median 
5). All patients had been exposed to, and majority were refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor 
(85.0%), at least one immunomodulatory agent (95%), and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody 
(97.5%). The observed efficacy is considered clinically relevant in this population. The CHMP requested 
that the indication for teclistamab is revised to relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have 
received at least three prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor 
and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy to better 
reflect the patient population of the pivotal study.  
The limited follow-up and overall size of the safety database from MajesTEC-1 also limit a 
comprehensive assessment of the risks associated with the use of teclistamab. While the acute safety 
profile, including common adverse reactions, can be considered reasonably established, longer-term 
safety data, also from appropriately controlled studies, will be required; together with a more 
comprehensive understanding of efficacy, this will enable an improved overall contextualisation of the 
safety profile. 
In the context of a CMA, the B/R balance is positive. 
4.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
It is acknowledged that conducting an RCT is challenging in a late line RRMM setting. However, it 
should be noted that “last line setting” in multiple myeloma is a moving target in this rapidly evolving 
field, and strictly only the Cohort C (patients exposed to a PI, an IMID, an anti-CD38 antibody and a 
BCMA-targeting therapy) serving as supportive data represent true last line setting in the current 
therapeutic landscape. This application is based on a single arm trial, and similar evidence base has 
supported several recent conditional marketing authorisations. Nevertheless, the evidence for efficacy 
generated in a single arm trial is less robust and subject to different types of bias, most notably 
selection bias. Time-to-event endpoints are considered important for demonstration of clinical benefit, 
but cannot be reliable assessed in a SAT setting. Thus, the pivotal SAT can be considered sufficient to 
demonstrate clinical benefit in this patient population, but not to provide comprehensive data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/789141/2022  
Page 140/144 
 
 
 
No external comparison has been provided to contextualise the data. However, the natural history of 
the disease is well characterised, and multiple clinical trials with other medicinal products have been 
performed in comparable patient populations. An overview of the relevant clinical trials has been 
provided. The pharmacological rationale is strong and there are no doubts on causality of effects. 
Even though ORR is accepted as an endpoint for regulatory purposes, the ultimate patient benefit as 
reflected in OS cannot be reliably determined in a single arm trial. The observed ORR is likely an over-
estimation due to a selected patient population, but the magnitude is sufficient to assume clinically 
relevant efficacy also in a broader patient population. Moreover, the depth of the observed responses 
(CR/sCR), MRD) provides important supportive data. The median DOR is 18.4 months which is 
considered clinically relevant. Importantly, PFS and OS demonstrating (long-term) treatment benefit 
cannot be reliably determined in a single arm trial. Thus, the available efficacy data is not considered 
to be comprehensive but is sufficient to demonstrate clinical benefit.  
In terms of safety, the number of patients exposed to teclistamab is limited but can be considered 
sufficient to characterise the expected overall safety profile. Teclistamab is administered until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity, and at the time of the updated data cut-off, over 40% of patients 
in the RP2D group were still on treatment. The patient population in the pivotal study is relatively 
young and fit considering the late line disease setting, and limited data on safety and tolerability of the 
treatment in less fit patients is available. Thus, the safety data cannot be considered to be 
comprehensive. 
In summary the data provided for MA are not regarded as comprehensive due to lack of interpretable 
time-to-event endpoints to determine treatment benefit and the extent of exposure and length of 
follow-up for safety. 
Based on the above, the clinical data are not considered comprehensive. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available as discussed above, a conditional marketing 
authorisation was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease.  
The product could fulfil the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The Applicant is conducting a randomised Phase 3 registration study, MajesTEC-3, in subjects 
with multiple myeloma who have been previously treated with 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, 
including a PI and lenalidomide. In this study, subjects will be randomised to receive a 
combination of teclistamab and daratumumab (Tec-Dara) or an investigator’s choice of DPd or 
DVd which are currently authorised therapies in this setting. Primary endpoint is progression free 
survival, and key secondary endpoints include overall response (PR or better), MRD negativity 
rate, patient reported outcomes and OS. Approximately 560 subjects will be randomised 1:1. 
This study will provide further confirmatory data on the safety and efficacy profile of teclistamab, 
and will address several aspects for lack of comprehensiveness of the available data, including 
limited number of patients, limited duration of follow-up, and especially lack of time-to-events 
endpoint data (PFS, OS) data to confirm clinical benefit of the treatment.  
The MajesTEC-3 study is currently ongoing, Aa with clinical cut-offs for interim and primary 
analyses expected in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, respectively.

•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed: 
Teclistamab will provide a novel, targeted option for the treatment of subjects with multiple 
myeloma, with a mechanism of action that is unique to all other approved therapies. It is thus 
expected that teclistamab will offer an additional option to patients that are no longer responsive 
to existing treatments for this condition.  
There are authorised treatments of MM in the EU, and multiple products reviewed by the 
Applicant have overlapping indications with the proposed indication with teclistamab. However, 
according to the current ESMO recommendations, once patients are refractory to an IMiD, PI, 
and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, the current recommendation is either belantamab 
mafodotin or selinexor. Both products are conditionally approved, and Teclistamab is expected to 
address the unmet medical need in the targeted patient population at least to a similar extent. 
Although comparison of response rates across single arm studies should be interpreted with 
caution, available data suggests superior response rates when compared with other available off-
the-shelf therapies. However, it should be noted that the patient populations in the registration 
trials for these products were more heavily pre-treated as compared to MajesTEC-1 population. 
Belantamab mafodotin application was based on data from the DREAMM-2 study, in which all 
subjects were triple-class refractory. ORR in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort of DREAMM-2 was 32%. 
Selinexor in combination with dexamethasone was approved for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least 4 prior therapies and whose disease is 
refractory to at least 2 PIs, 2 IMiDs, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. In the STORM study, a PR or better was 
observed in 25.3% of subjects and the median duration of response was 3.8 months. 
The CAR T therapies idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel which have also 
received conditional approvals, have shown comparable rates of response in this setting (ORR 
67% and 84%, respectively). However, this treatment may not be suitable for all patients due to 
their potential to cause severe safety events and complexity of the treatment (limited availability 
in specialised treatment centres, delay in treatment related to the manufacturing process, need 
for bridging therapy). Teclistamab therefore offers an alternative therapeutic option that will be 
readily available to a broader patient population.  
Furthermore, preliminary data from Cohort C of the MajesTEC-1 study also suggest that 
teclistamab provides benefit for patients who have already been treated with a BCMA-targeting 
ADC or CAR-T therapy, where there are very limited treatment options and is an area of further 
unmet medical need. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability are considered to outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required, as an additional therapy option for 
RRMM patients with three or more previous systemic therapies is considered beneficial.  
4.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Tecvayli is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

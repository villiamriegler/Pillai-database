Summary of risk management plan for Arikayce (amikacin sulfate) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Arikayce.  The RMP details important 
risks of Arikayce, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Arikayce's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Arikayce's  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Arikayce should be used.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Arikayce's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Arikayce  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  Mycobacterium  Avium  Complex  lung 
infection (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains amikacin sulfate as the active substance 
and it is given by inhalation. 
Further information about the evaluation of  Arikayce’s benefits can be found in Arikayce’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/arikayce-liposomal. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Arikayce,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Arikayce 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Arikayce is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Arikayce  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Arikayce.  Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.    Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Allergic alveolitis 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Allergic  alveolitis  is  a  condition  in  which  the  air  sacs  in  the  lung  become 
inflamed  due  to  breathing  in  foreign  substances  including,  in  some  cases, 
certain medicines. 
In  clinical  studies  with  Arikayce  for  the  treatment  of  nontuberculous 
mycobacterial  lung  disease  the  percentage  of  subject  in  whom  allergic 
alveolitis  was  reported  was  3.2%,  which  was  higher  than  the  percentage  in 
subjects that were not treated with Arikayce in the same studies (1.3%).  
The evidence is derived from randomised, controlled clinical trials.  Evidence 
from these sources is considered to be a reliable predictor of how subjects will 
respond to treatment in clinical practice, by convention. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk factors for the development of allergic alveolitis in response to treatment 
with inhaled Arikayce have not been identified.  
In  the  general  population,  repeated  exposure  to  inhaled  organic  materials 
including  inhaled  medicines  increases  the  risk  of  development  of  allergic 
alveolitis.

Important identified risk: Ototoxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Ototoxicity  refers  to  drug  or  chemical-related  damage  to  the  inner  ear, 
resulting in damage to the organs responsible for hearing and balance.  Such 
damage  can  lead  to  temporary  or  permanent  hearing  loss,  and/or  loss  of 
balance.  
In  clinical  studies  with  Arikayce  for  the  treatment  of  nontuberculous 
mycobacterial lung disease the percentage of subject in whom ototoxicity was 
reported  was  17.8%,  which  was  higher  than  the  percentage  in  subjects  that 
were not treated with Arikayce in the same studies (10.2%).  
The evidence is derived from randomised, controlled clinical trials.  Evidence 
from these sources is considered to be a reliable predictor of how subjects will 
respond to treatment in clinical practice, by convention. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk factors for the development of ototoxicity in response to treatment with 
inhaled Arikayce have not been identified.  
In  the  general  population,  the  following  factors  may  influence  the  risk  of 
development of ototoxicity in response to aminoglycoside antibiotics: 
  dose and duration of treatment; 
  cumulative lifetime dose; 
 
 
 
impaired kidney function;  
treatment with another ototoxic drug at the same time; 
increasing age; 
  pre-existing hearing loss; 
  genetic susceptibility; 
 
family history of ototoxicity.

Important identified risk: Nephrotoxicity 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Nephrotoxicity refers to damage to kidney function as a result of exposure to 
certain substances including chemicals and some medicines. 
In  clinical  studies  with  Arikayce  for  the  treatment  of  nontuberculous 
mycobacterial lung disease the percentage of subject in whom nephrotoxicity 
was reported was 4.2%, which was higher than the percentage in subjects that 
were not treated with Arikayce in the same studies (2.5%).  
The evidence is derived from randomised, controlled clinical trials.  Evidence 
from these sources is considered to be a reliable predictor of how subjects will 
respond to treatment in clinical practice, by convention. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  nephrotoxicity  in  response  to  treatment 
with inhaled Arikayce have not been identified.  
Pre-existing kidney disease and simultaneous treatment with other drugs that 
may affect the kidney are the most important risk factors for nephrotoxicity. 
In  the  general  population,  the  following  factors  may  influence  the  risk  of 
development  of  nephrotoxicity  in  response  to  aminoglycoside  antibiotics, 
including  Arikayce:    The  presence  of  other  serious  illnesses;  low  blood 
volume; liver disease; sepsis ((blood poisoning); low blood level of potassium; 
low  blood  level  of  magnesium;  advanced  age;  prolonged  treatment;  high 
frequency of  dosing;  high blood level of  aminoglycoside antibiotic;  and the 
timing of treatment administration.

Important identified risk: Impaired neuromuscular transmission 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Impaired  neuromuscular  transmission  refers  to  a  condition  in  which  nerve 
impulses cannot be properly transmitted to muscles to make them contract.  This 
may lead to muscle weakness or fluctuating muscle fatigue. 
In  clinical  studies  with  Arikayce  for  the  treatment  of  nontuberculous 
mycobacterial  lung  disease  the  percentage  of  subject  in  whom  impaired 
neuromuscular transmission was reported was 3.0%, which was higher than the 
percentage in subjects that were not treated with Arikayce in the same studies 
(0.6%).  
The evidence is derived from randomised, controlled clinical trials.  Evidence 
from these sources is considered to be a reliable predictor of how subjects will 
respond to treatment in clinical practice, by convention. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  impaired  neuromuscular  transmission  in 
response to treatment with inhaled Arikayce have not been identified.  
In  the  general  population,  the  following  factors  may  influence  the  risk  of 
development  of  impaired  neuromuscular  transmission  during  treatment  with 
aminoglycoside  antibiotics  including  Arikayce:  the  presence  of  diseases 
affecting neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert 
that  affect 
syndrome);  simultaneous 
neuromuscular transmission (e.g., muscle relaxants used in anaesthesia); recent 
exposure to some agricultural insecticides.

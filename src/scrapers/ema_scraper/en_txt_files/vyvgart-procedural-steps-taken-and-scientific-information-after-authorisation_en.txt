1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and PL 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC are updated to inform 
to amend an existing warning on use of vaccination 
and update drug-drug interaction information on 
vaccines based on final results from study ARGX-
113-2102; this is a phase 1, randomized, open-label, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate 
the immune response to PNEUMOVAX 23 in healthy 
participants receiving efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg or 
placebo. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. The RMP version 2.1 was adopted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
that the safety of immunisation with live or live attenuated 
vaccines and the response to immunisation with these 
vaccines during treatment with efgartigimod alfa are 
unknown. For patients that are being treated with 
efgartigimod alfa, vaccination with live or live attenuated 
vaccines is generally not recommended. If vaccination with 
live or live attenuated vaccines is required, these vaccines 
should be administered at least 4 weeks before treatment 
and at least 2 weeks after the last dose of efgartigimod 
alfa. However, other vaccines may be administered as 
needed at any time during treatment with efgartigimod 
alfa.

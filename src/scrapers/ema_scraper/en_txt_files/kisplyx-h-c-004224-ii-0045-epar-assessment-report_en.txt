2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include the first-line combination treatment with 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab of adult patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
The approved indication is:  
Kisplyx is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC): 
• 
in combination with pembrolizumab, as first-line treatment (see section 5.1). 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Worldwide, kidney cancer is the 14th most common cancer, and is the 9th most frequently diagnosed 
cancer in men and 14th in women (World Cancer Research Fund, 2020).  Renal cell carcinoma is the most 
common type of kidney cancer, constituting the majority of primary renal neoplasms.  Most cases of RCC 
(70%–80%) are classified as clear-cell tumours.  
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The proposed new indication for Kisplyx in this procedure is: 
“Kisplyx in combination with pembrolizumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcinoma in adults” 
The proposed posology for this new indication is 20 mg lenvatinib administered orally once daily (QD) in 
combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) 
Epidemiology  
Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, constituting the majority of primary 
renal neoplasms.  Most cases of RCC (70%–80%) are classified as clear-cell tumours.  
In 2020, an estimated 138,611 new cases of kidney cancer were expected to be diagnosed in Europe with 
approximately 54,054 people expected to die from the disease (GLOBOCAN, 2020).Well-known risk 
factors for RCC are cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension (Chow et al. Nat Rev Urol. 2010). 
Biologic features 
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, comprising 80-90% of 
all kidney tumours (2020 European Association of Urology [EAU] RCC guidelines). 
Approximately 2%-3% of all RCCs are hereditary and several autosomal dominant syndromes are 
described, each with a distinct genetic basis and phenotype, the most common one being von Hippel–
Lindau (VHL) disease (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 8/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Many renal masses remain asymptomatic until the late disease stages. Currently, >50% of RCCs are 
detected accidentally by non-invasive imaging investigating various non-specific symptoms and other 
abdominal diseases (2020 EAU RCC guidelines; Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). In addition, 25-40% of 
the patients that are radically treated (nephrectomy) will eventually relapse. ‘Advanced’ RCC (hereafter 
simply referred to as advanced RCC) entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local 
therapy, i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus 
requires systemic treatment. All histological epithelial subtypes of RCC (clear cell, papillary, 
chromophobe) can present with sarcomatoid differentiation, which is the most aggressive form of RCC. A 
high proportion of RCC patients with sarcomatoid features presents with metastatic disease. These 
features are found in 5-8% of clear cell RCC.  
RCC with sarcomatoid features is characterised by limited therapeutic options due to its relative 
resistance to established systemic targeted therapy. Most trials report on a poor median OS of 5 to 12 
months. Studies have shown that sarcomatoid RCC express programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 
(PD-L1) at a much higher level than non-sarcomatoid RCC, suggesting that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 
axis may be an attractive new therapeutic strategy (Pichler et al. Cancers (Basel). 2019). 
Management 
Renal cell carcinoma generally resists both traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Surgical 
resection can be curative for patients presenting with localized disease. However, one third of patients 
present with regional or distant metastases and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease is 
approximately 12%.   
Cytokine based immunotherapy was the standard of care for advanced RCC until developments in the 
understanding of the pathogenesis and molecular biology of RCC led to the identification of angiogenesis 
as a key factor in the development of RCC.  This led to a shift from predominantly cytokine-based 
treatment options to the use of targeted agents, including those targeted against VEGF/receptors of VEGF 
(VEGFR), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).   
New treatment approach for patients with treatment naïve advanced RCC consisted of single agent VEGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pazopanib, and sunitinib.  This approach improved clinical outcomes and 
expanded treatment options. 
Several immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations have demonstrated a survival advantage in advanced 
RCC and standard, globally approved 1L therapy has changed to include nivolumab plus ipilimumab (for 
International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium [IMDC] intermediate or poor risk 
disease), axitinib plus avelumab, axitinib plus pembrolizumab, and cabozantinib plus nivolumab (National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2021).  All of the pivotal studies that support these indications 
included sunitinib as the comparator arm, since sunitinib was standard of care at the time they were 
initiated and conducted.   
As of 2020, the ESMO guidelines include combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab, which is now 
recommended as front-line therapy for advanced disease. This is based on data from the CheckMate 9ER 
study, which compared programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors plus vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) versus sunitinib in the front-line setting. Results 
showed a significant overall survival advantage (OS) for cabozantinib and nivolumab at interim analysis 
(18.1 months median follow-up) [(hazard ratio (HR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.89; 
P<0.001). Reponses rates and progression-free survival (PFS) also significantly favoured the combination 
(56% versus 27% and HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.64, respectively).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Lenvatinib 
Lenvatinib is a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) active against both VEGFR, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 
(KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4) and FGFR, FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4. Lenvatinib also inhibits other Receptors 
Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumour growth, and

Rationale for the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in RCC 
Renal cell carcinoma is a highly vascularized tumour, and VEGF is a crucial regulator of both physiologic 
and pathologic angiogenesis; increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis (Ferrara, 
et al., 2003; Posadas, et al., 2013).  Accumulated evidence also suggests that FGF and its receptor 
tyrosine kinase, FGFR, play a role in angiogenesis and contribute to the aggressiveness of RCC (Cross and 
Claesson-Welsh, 2001; Lieu, et al., 2011; Limaverde-Sousa, et al., 2014).  Therefore, the blocking of not 
only VEGFRs but also FGFRs may be important for antiangiogenesis (Hojjat-Farsangi, 2014).  In addition, 
FGF induced angiogenesis has been reported to be involved in resistance to anti VEGF/VEGFR therapy; 
therefore, inhibition of FGF may decrease the rate of drug resistance (Dieci, et al., 2013; Stjepanovic and 
Capdevila, 2014). 
Renal cell carcinoma is also considered an immunogenic tumour, as evidenced by the use of cytokine-
based immunotherapy, which affords long-term durable response in some patients.  Upregulation of the 
anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and its ligand PD-L1 on 
tumour cells, is associated with poor prognosis (Hsieh, et al., 2018). 
The immune-modulating effect of lenvatinib may result in a potent combination effect with PD-1/L1 signal 
inhibitors.  Thus, the effect of combining lenvatinib with an anti- PD-1 mAb (a surrogate for 
pembrolizumab) was investigated.  The combination was tested in 4 murine tumour isograft models and 
showed significant tumour growth inhibition compared with control.  Significantly longer survival was 
observed in the RAG murine tumour isograft model (Study M18018), and a significant increase in the 
population of activated cytotoxic T cells was observed in the CT26 murine tumour isograft model, in 
groups treated with the combination compared with the respective monotherapy groups (Kato, et al., 
2019).  Treatment was well tolerated, and severe body weight loss was not observed (data on file). 
Combinations involving PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors have become effective therapies in several 
malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer, RCC, and endometrial carcinoma (Schmidt, 2019).  
Lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab was examined in the multi cohort Phase 1b/2 Study E7080 
A001 111/KEYNOTE 146 (hereafter referred to as Study 111/KN-146), a multicenter, open-label study 
that was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumour activity of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab in patients with advanced RCC, endometrial carcinoma, melanoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and urothelial carcinoma.  
The primary objective of the Phase 1b part of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for lenvatinib to be used in combination with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (treatment dosage for all currently approved indications).  The RP2D, 20 mg 
daily, was evaluated for efficacy and safety in the Phase 2 portion.  Across cohorts, ORRs (per immune 
related RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment) ranged from 25% to 70%, with the most favourable 
responses seen among patients with RCC, EC, and melanoma (Taylor, et al., 2020).  Efficacy data for the 
first 30 subjects with RCC treated with zero to 5 prior therapies, revealed that the ORR was 70% (95% 
CI:  50.6, 85.3).  These efficacy data were compelling, showing significant tumour reduction with durable 
responses in treatment naïve and previously treated subjects.  Moreover, adverse events (AEs) were 
manageable with dose interruptions and dose reductions, and there were no new safety signals for either 
lenvatinib or pembrolizumab.  Based on these data, the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab development

program was expanded, which currently consists of 16 Phase 2 and Phase 3 registration studies in a 
range of indications.  Lenvatinib 20 mg QD (starting dosage) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W were the 
RP2D for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in Study 111, and thus were used in Study 307 
and have been implemented as the recommended starting dosages across the program

Rapporteur/Co-rapporteur/EMA  
To discuss the topline data of Study 307/KN581 and the new indication filing. 
In the Scientific Advice from 01 April 2016, the CHMP pointed the risk of underestimating PFS (and ORR) 
in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm (arm B) vs. arms A and C should be taken into consideration. It 
was also noted that PFS was be determined using irRECIST for Arm B only as an exploratory endpoint, 
but the Applicant may also consider including also irRECIST for arms A and C for comparison. In a 
subsequent amendment to the Study 307 protocol (ie amendment 7), the exporatory objective to assess 
PFS by irRECIST has been removed from the protocol. 
The proposed stratification factors, geographic region and MSKCC prognostic risk model (alternatively 
IMDC could be considered), were considered acceptable. MSKCC prognostic risk model was employed as 
stratification factor (in addition to geographic location) and in the analysis the IMDC was 
programmatically derived and included in the subgroup analyses. 
The evidence to support the contribution of components was discussed in the Scientific Advice from 18 
Oct 2018. It acknowledged the Applicant’s intention to demonstrate the contribution of each agent based 
on cross-study comparisons of the efficacy data for the lenvatinib monotherapy in 2L and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in 1L, compared to the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in 1L. The CHMP 
noted that it was presumed that the patient population influences the likelihood of OR; therefore, cross 
study comparisons also of this parameter were not straightforward. Furthermore ORR is generally seen as 
a marker of pharmacodynamic activity and not as a clinical benefit per se; however, showing convincing 
additive effects on ORR are generally accepted as supportive of combination use. 
CHMP pointed out that a randomised comparison, even of ORR rather than relevant time to event 
endpoints would be preferred and that eventually the contribution of components would be a review 
issue, dependent on the actual ORR observed in Study 307. 
Regulatory concerns regarding the dissemination of results in case of positive IA findings in the US were 
discussed. A submission to FDA may in itself trigger anticipation regarding efficacy of the combination. 
This could affect the behaviour of investigators and patients still on therapy in this open-label trial and 
ultimately the conclusions of the study. 
During the pre-submission meeting with the Rappoterur/Co-rapporteur/EMA, there was an agreement on 
the data to be submitted. Updated OS data were agreed to be provided during the review procedure.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support this submission for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab, 4 in vivo primary 
pharmacodynamics studies were conducted with lenvatinib, rat anti-murine programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone RMP1-14, as a surrogate antibody for pembrolizumab, and the 
combination of lenvatinib with anti-PD-1 mAb. The following in vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies 
were conducted: 
• Antitumour activity in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb in the RAG murine RCC, LL/2 murine Lewis lung 
carcinoma, Hepa1-6 murine HCC, and CT26 murine colon carcinoma isograft models 
• Effects of lenvatinib in combination with anti-murine PD-1 mAb on the populations of tumour-associated 
macrophages and cytotoxic T cells in the tumour microenvironment in a murine tumour isograft model 
• Effects of CD8+ T-cell depleting anti-murine CD8α mAb on the antitumour activity of lenvatinib in 
murine tumour isograft models 
• Effects of interferon-γ (IFN- γ) neutralizing anti-murine IFN-γ mAb on the antitumour activity of 
lenvatinib and lenvatinib in combination with anti-murine PD-1 mAb in a murine tumour isograft model

In vivo pharmacodynamics 
1)  Antitumour Activity of Lenvatinib in Combination With Anti-Murine PD-1 mAb in the RAG Murine 
Renal Cell Carcinoma Isograft Model 
Rat anti-murine PD-1 mAb (anti-PD-1 mAb, clone RMP1-14) was used as a surrogate antibody for 
pembrolizumab, an anti-human PD-1 humanized mAb. RAG cells were inoculated subcutaneously into 6-
week old female immunocompetent BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mice. At 7 days after inoculation, lenvatinib 
mesilate (10 mg/kg), anti-PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg), and rat IgG2a isotype control (control immunoglobulin 
G [IgG], 10 mg/kg) were administered to mice (20/group). 
Lenvatinib and vehicle were administered orally once daily for 28 days, and anti-PD-1 mAb and 
control IgG were administered intraperitoneally twice per week totalling 8 times (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 
15, 18, 22, and 25). A survival day was defined for each mouse as a duration from Day 1 to the 
day when the mouse was euthanized or found dead.

Figure 2 Antitumour Activity of Lenvatinib in Combination With Anti-PD-1 mAb Against the RAG Murine 
RCC Isografts 
The TV and body weight were measured twice per week (Days 1 – 63 and Days 71 – 90) or once per 
week (Days 64 – 70). The TV was calculated according to the formula: TV (mm3) = length (mm) × 
width2 (mm2) × ½. The relative body weight (RBW) was calculated as a ratio of the mean body weight at 
a given time point to the mean body weight at the initiation of dosing. 
Lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) monotherapy and lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg) 
showed significant TGI compared to the control group from Days 8 to 22 in the RAG isograft model, the 
antitumour activity of the combination of lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 mAb was only slightly greater than that 
of lenvatinib monotherapy on Days 18 and 22. Severe body weight loss ( BWL) (>20% compared to Day 
1) was not observed during the dosing period (Days 1 to 28) in any of the treatment groups.

Each line represents the percent survival of 20 animals per group through Day 90. The horizontal bar signifies the dosing period of 
lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 mAb. A total of 66 mice were euthanized on Days 22 – 90 because their TV was >2000 mm3. In the control 
group, 3/20 mice were found dead on Days 24 – 25. In the combination group, 2/20 mice were found dead on Days 41 and 54, and 
1/20 mice was euthanized on Day 78 due to hemorrhage-related tumor rupture. BIW = twice per week, IgG = immunoglobulin G, mAb

RAG Murine RCC Isograft Model 
Comparable results were obtained when evaluating the antitumour activity of lenvatinib in combination 
with anti-Murine PD-1 mAb in the LL/2 (LLC1) Murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma Isograft Model and in 
an the Hepa1-6 Murine HCC Isograft Model (data not shown). 
2)  Antitumour and Immunomodulatory Activity of Lenvatinib in the CT26 Murine Colon Carcinoma 
Isograft Model 
Antitumour activity of lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb was also evaluated in the CT26 
murine colon carcinoma isografts in syngeneic immunocompetent BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mice and athymic 
CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj mice (Kato et al. 2019). Here more extensive studies have been performed.  
CT26 cells were inoculated in syngeneic immunocompetent BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mice (7-week old females. 
When tumour sizes reached a mean volume of 33 mm3 (Day 1), vehicle (3 mmol/L HCl), lenvatinib 
mesilate (10 mg/kg), anti-PD-1 mAb; (200 μg/animal, clone RMP1-14), or the combination of lenvatinib 
and anti-PD-1 mAb was administered to the mice (8/group). Lenvatinib was administered orally once 
daily for 25 days for monotherapy, and once daily for 28 days for combination therapy. Anti-PD-1 mAb 
was administered intraperitoneally once every 3 days totalling 7 times for monotherapy, and once every 3 
days totalling 10 times for combination therapy. The TV and body weight were measured twice per week.   
As Figure 5.2.3 demonstrates lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) monotherapy and anti-PD-1 mAb (200 μg/animal) 
monotherapy showed Tumour Growth Inhibition (TGI) compared with the vehicle control. In addition, 
antitumour activity of their combination therapy was greater than that of either monotherapy on Day 19. 
Severe BWL (>20% compared to Day 1) was not noted in any treated groups.  
As shown in Figure 4 (B), flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of the population of TAMs 
was decreased, and the populations of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and GzmB+CD8+ T cells (activated cytotoxic 
T cells) were increased in the tumours of mice treated with lenvatinib alone, and those treated with the 
combination of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 mAb compared with those of vehicle-control mice. The 
GzmB+CD8+ T cell population expressing a cytotoxic enzyme, GzmB, was increased following treatment 
with the combination compared with that of lenvatinib monotherapy. 
Therefore, lenvatinib could modulate the Tumour Microenviroment (TME) by decreasing the 
immunosuppressive TAM population and the increasing activated cytotoxic T cell population. Here no 
significant difference could be demonstrated between the TAM suppression and cytotoxic T-cell activation 
of lenvatinib monotherapy and the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab combination.

The antitumour activity of lenvatinib monotherapy and the combination therapy was also decreased in 
mice injected with anti-IFN-γ mAb, whereas the antitumour activity of anti-PD-1 mAb monotherapy was 
not affected by injection with anti-IFN-γ mAb. These results suggested that IFN-γ signaling contributed to 
the antitumour activity of lenvatinib and the combination of lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 mAb in this model.

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab; 
however, since pembrolizumab is enzymatically catabolized to individual amino acids while lenvatinib is 
cleared via aldehyde oxidase and cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism, as well as spontaneous 
hydrolysis, no metabolic drug interactions are expected. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
The possibility of toxicologic interaction of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab is considered low based on the 
toxicity profiles of the 2 agents. The toxicities observed with the 2 agents are consistent with their 
respective mechanisms of action, and the combination of lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 mAb (surrogate for 
pembrolizumab) was well tolerated when studied in mouse isograft models. No significant mortality or 
body weight loss was observed in these studies.  
In the chronic toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys with lenvatinib, target organ toxicity was 
primarily observed in the kidneys, gastro-intestinal tract, artery/arteriole in various organs, bone, and 
male and female reproductive organs (testis and ovary) in both species, and in the incisor and adrenals in 
rats. These findings were reversible and most were not evident at the end of a recovery period of 4 
weeks. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for the 26- and 39-week toxicity studies in rats 
and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively, were the lowest doses tested in those studies (0.4 and 0.1 
mg/kg, respectively). The exposure margins at the NOAELs based on systemic exposure (area under the 
concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours; AUC(0-24)) compared to exposures at the maximum 
recommended human dose (24 mg) were 0.7- to 0.8-fold in rats and 0.1-fold in monkeys. 
The nonclinical safety of pembrolizumab was characterized in cynomolgus monkeys in toxicology studies 
up to 6-months duration. Pembrolizumab was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to a 200 
mg/kg/dose with corresponding systemic exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve 
from zero time to Day 14 (AUC(0-14d)) of approximately 67,500 μg·day/mL with biweekly dosing over the 
course of the 6-month study. No findings of toxicologic significance were observed and the NOAEL was ≥ 
200 mg/kg. The exposure margins at the NOAEL based on AUC(0-tau) are ≥ 19-fold and ≥ 74-fold 
compared to exposures at the human dose of 10 mg/kg and 200 mg, respectively. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
It was previously concluded that “The findings of the nonclinical studies indicate that by general 
comparison of the responses observed with the extremely low environmental exposure”. Based on 
previous environmental risk assessments (ERA), lenvatinib has not been identified as a PBT (persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic) or a vPvB substance (very persistent and bioaccumulative) and there are no 
environmental concerns expected for lenvatinib.  
An additional ERA was performed to evaluate the potential environmental risk (PECSURFACEWATER) from the 
use of lenvatinib for the additional indication of first treatment of RCC, as well as for different 
combinations of indications. The individual PECSURFACEWATER value of lenvatinib for first line RCC is below 
the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. Based on worst-case assumptions for patient populations eligible for 
treatment, the total of the lenvatinib PECSURFACEWATER values for all the indications (RR-DTC, HCC, 1L or 2L 
RCC & 2L EC) just exceeds the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. However, refining the calculation for the patient 
population eligible for 2nd line treatment for EC resulted in PECSURFACEWATER values below the action limit 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 20/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for all combinations. In conclusion, lenvatinib is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment when 
used in accordance with the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lenvatinib is an oral multiple RTK inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of VEGF receptors 
VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic 
pathway-related RTKs including FGF receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the PDGF receptor PDGFRα; KIT; and 
RET.  
In vivo human tumour xenograft studies in athymic mice have shown that lenvatinib exerts antitumour 
activity against various tumour types including RCC, thyroid cancer, HCC, non-small cell lung cancer, 
melanoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer, mainly through its potent inhibition of 
tumour angiogenesis driven by VEGFR and FGFR signaling.  
The new nonclinical studies conducted with lenvatinib investigated the antitumour activity of lenvatinib 
and the combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 mAb (used as a surrogate antibody for 
pembrolizumab), in murine tumour isograft models of RCC, HCC, colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma. In 
addition, the immunomodulatory activity of lenvatinib in murine tumour isograft models using 
immunocompetent mice and athymic mice was investigated to determine the effects of lenvatinib on the 
host immune systems in the tumour microenvironment. 
Lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg, 200 μg/animal, or 500 μg/animal) 
showed significant tumour growth inhibition compared to the control group against the isografts of RAG 
murine RCC, LL/2 murine Lewis lung carcinoma, Hepa1-6 murine HCC, and CT26 murine colon carcinoma 
in immunocompetent mice. Lenvatinib monotherapy and lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb 
showed inhibition of tumour growth, however, the antitumour activity of the combination of lenvatinib 
and anti-PD-1 mAb was only slightly greater than that of lenvatinib monotherapy in every model 
investigated. Severe body weight loss (ie, >20% compared to the initial day of dosing) was not noted for 
any treatment groups in these models. 
Lenvatinib showed greater antitumour activity in immunocompetent mice than in athymic mice in the 
Hepa1-6 and CT26 isograft models, and antitumour activity in immunocompetent mice was significantly 
decreased by CD8+ T-cell depletion with the prior and concomitant injection of an anti-CD8α mAb in both 
models. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the population of tumour-associated macrophages in the 
tumour microenvironment was significantly decreased and populations of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and 
granzyme B+CD8+ T cells (both considered activated cytotoxic T cells) were significantly increased in the 
groups treated with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus anti- PD-1 mAb. However, these experiments could not 
convincingly demonstrate an additive effect of anti-PD-1 treatment to the lenvatinib monotherapy.  
In addition, the antitumour activity of lenvatinib as well as lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 mAb was significantly 
reduced by the prior and concomitant injection of an IFN-γ neutralizing anti-murine IFN-γ mAb, but the 
antitumour activity of anti-PD-1 mAb monotherapy was not changed by anti-IFN-γ mAb in this model. 
These results suggested that in addition to its anti-angiogenesis activity, the immunomodulatory activity 
of lenvatinib involving the decrease of immunosuppressive tumour-associated macrophages, increase of 
activated cytotoxic T cells, and an activation of IFN-γ signaling contributes to its antitumour activity in 
immunocompetent mice.  
No new PK or toxicology studies were conducted with lenvatinib or pembrolizumab to support this 
submission, which is considered acceptable based on the available clinical data on lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab. Because pembrolizumab was well tolerated in chronic toxicity studies, the potential of a 
toxicologic interaction with lenvatinib is considered low. The clinical adverse effect profiles of both agents 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 21/144 
 
 
 
 
have been well characterized in the various clinical trials conducted with each agent. In addition, the 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab is being evaluated in 
completed/ongoing clinical studies (Study 111/KN-146 and KEYNOTE-523 Phase 1b studies in subjects 
with solid tumours including EC, Study 307/KN-581 Phase 3 in advanced RCC, Study 309/KN-775 Phase 3 
study in subjects with EC).  
The applicant provided additional data for the ERA regarding the prevalence of the disease population 
targeted by the first line RCC, as well as for different combinations of indications. Based on the updated 
data submitted in this application, the new indication does not lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of lenvatinib. Considering the above data, lenvatinib is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The available pharmacodynamics studies in mice tumour isograft models (RCC, HCC, colon carcinoma and 
lung carcinoma) showed that the antitumour activity of the combination therapy of lenvatinib and the 
anti-PD-1 mAb (pembrolizumab) was greater than either monotherapy, however the difference to 
Lenvatinib monotherapy was not striking especially in the murine model of RCC.  
Nevertheless, the previously established antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib resulting from the inhibition 
of VEGFR and FGFR signalling and its immunomodulatory activity with a different mode of action from a 
PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (decrease of TAMs, increase of activated cytotoxic T cells and 
activation of IFN-γ signalling) could indeed lead to an additive effect of both components in RCC. 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new indication does not lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of lenvatinib. Considering the above data, 
lenvatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology data pertaining to the existing licenses are contained in the original lenvatinib 
Marketing Authorization Application.  
The current application concerns the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for the first-line 
treatment of patients with advanced RCC based on efficacy and safety data for the combination from the 
Phase 3 Study 307. In addition to the studies supporting the proposed indication, the applicant mentions 
that newly completed studies were carried out to evaluate the effect of intrinsic factors and for drug-drug 
interactions. 
Updated clinical pharmacology data are included in the following studies:  
● Study 307; lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination in subjects with RCC 
• E7080-A001-010; in subjects with either renal or hepatic impairment and matched healthy    
controls. 
• E7080-A001-109; in subjects with solid tumours to determine the effect of lenvatinib on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam (a cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4] substrate) 
• Population PK analysis of lenvatinib on pooled data from several studies, including PK/safety 
analyses from Study 307/Arm B data. 
• The observed pembrolizumab and incidence rate of anti-drug antibodies of pembrolizumab in 
combination with lenvatinib in Study 307 Arm B were summarized and compared with historical 
rates from pembrolizumab monotherapy 
Bioanalytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods used for the determination of lenvatinib concentration in human plasma 
The main biopharmaceutics information has been previously presented in the submissions for 
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC), second line RCC in combination with everolimus and HCC.   
A sensitive, specific, and reproducible method was developed and validated for the determination of 
lenvatinib (free base concentration) in human plasma (sodium heparinized) and was previously reported 
in DTC and HCC indications and are not discussed. 
Study 307 
Plasma samples from study 307 were analyzed for lenvatinib. The results from the calibration standards 
and quality control samples demonstrated acceptable performance of the method for all reported 
concentrations and met acceptance criteria for incurred sample reproducibility. 670 out of 701 (95.58%) 
samples for lenvatinib met the acceptance criteria.  
Immunogenicity assays and strategy used for the detection and characterisation of Anti-drug Antibody 
(ADA) against Pembrolizumab  
The samples were assayed for anti-pembrolizumab antibodies presence using a validated 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay on the MesoScale Discovery (MSD) platform. Bioanalysis 
of pembrolizumab ADA was carried out using the standard 3-tiered assay approach that consisted of 
screening (Tier 1), confirmation (Tier 2) and antibody titer assessment (Tier 3). Only Tier 2 confirmed 
ADA positive samples were moved to Tier 3 and reported with a titer value and a neutralizing antibody 
(NAb) result. 
Pembrolizumab could interfere with the antibody assays at concentrations above the drug tolerance level 
(DTL). Therefore, an integrated evaluation of pembrolizumab ADA results and pembrolizumab serum 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 25/144 
 
 
 
 
concentration was created for interpretation of immunogenicity results. A flow chart of the ADA sample 
analysis is given in the figure below. 
The DTL for the ADA assay, executed at the vendor PPD, is 124 µg/mL. 
Figure 6 Flow Chart of ADA Sample Analysis 
Tier 2 confirmed ADA positive samples were also characterized for neutralizing capacity using a 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay based on the ability of ADA to block (neutralize) the critical first step in 
the pharmacological action of pembrolizumab, which is binding to PD-1, it’s in vivo target. 
The neutralizing assay was a validated ligand binding ECL assay, with an assay cut point of 1% false 
positives. The assay employed, next to the acid dissociation step, a purification step to further reduce the 
influence of remaining drug in the study serum sample. 
The flow chart followed for the ADA subject analysis is presented in the figure below: 
Figure 7 Flow Chart of ADA Subject Analysis 
It should be noted that the subject with pre-treatment and postdose sample positive in the confirmatory 
assay for antibodies against pembrolizumab is considered subject treatment-emergent positive if  an 
increase in titer ≥ 2 fold of baseline is observed (treatment-boosted positive). 
An immunogenicity evaluation of pembrolizumab combination therapy with lenvatinib in subjects with 
advanced RCC has been performed using data from Eisai Study E7080-G000-307 (Study 307) / 
KEYNOTE-581. For pembrolizumab combination therapy, ADA samples were available from 343 subjects. 
A subset of the subjects was not assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity because the subjects were 
not treated with pembrolizumab or only a pre-treatment ADA sample was available (N=11). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 26/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remaining 332 subjects were assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity analysis. On those assessable 
subjects, 18 subjects were found inconclusive, i.e. subjects with no positive ADA samples present and the 
drug concentration in the last sample above the drug tolerance level. A listing of all the ADA samples has 
been presented. 
Absorption, Distribution, Elimination 
No new Absorption, distribution and Elimination data have been submitted in this application. The data 
provided on protein binding (study E7080-A001-010) are not new since they were submitted in a 
previous worksharing procedure (WS1607) in 2019 (see below).  The information on lenvatinib 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination is unchanged from the original DTC (Lenvima) and 
RCC (Kisplyx) indications. 
Special populations 
E7080-A001-010 
During review of the initial Marketing Authorisation Applications, the applicant was requested to provide 
the results from the Multicenter Phase 1 Study in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Either Hepatic or 
Renal Impairment to Obtain Plasma To Assess In Vitro Lenvatinib Protein Binding (Study E7080-A001-
010). This commitment was captured as Measure 010 in the Post-Authorisation Measures for Lenvima and 
Measure 005 for Kisplyx.  
The primary objective of this multicenter parallel-group study was to obtain plasma from subjects with 
mild, moderate, or severe hepatic or renal impairment, as well as healthy subjects for use in in-vitro 
protein binding studies in order to define correctly the dose-adjustment in patients with severe hepatic 
and renal impairment and determine unbound drug concentration. 
Lenvatinib plasma protein binding results are similar to previously reported ex-vivo and in-vitro studies 
conducted by equilibrium dialysis, and unbound plasma protein binding of lenvatinib correlated with 
serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentrations regardless of the degree of hepatic or renal 
impairment. No new safety concerns were identified during this study. There is therefore no impact on 
the benefit and risk conclusions based on the results of Study E7080-A001-010 and the benefit-risk 
balance of Lenvima-Kisplyx remains positive.

Figure 8  Plasma Protein Binding Versus Lenvatinib Concentrations by Hepatic Impairment 
Status – Safety Analysis Set 
From E7080-A001-010, it can be concluded that plasma protein binding in both hepatically and renally 
impaired subjects was similar to the respective matched healthy subjects and no concentration 
dependency was observed for lenvatinib binding in plasma. Lenvatinib plasma protein binding ranged 
from 98.0% to 98.4% in renally impaired subjects; 97.5% to 98.2% in hepatically impaired subjects; and 
98.0% to 98.2% in matched healthy control subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study E7080-A001-109 
During the review of initial MAAs, it was requested that the applicant investigates the potential of 
lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction (study 109) in a drug-drug interaction study. The commitment 
was captured as Measure 006 from the Post-Authorisation Measures for Lenvima and Measure 003 for 
Kisplyx. 
In order to fulfil the commitment, Eisai herein submitted in 2018 the results of the finalised Phase 1 study 
E7080-A001-109, to determine DDI of lenvatinib (E7080) and midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in 
subjects with advanced solid tumours (Study Title - An Open-Label Phase 1 Study to Determine the Effect 
of Lenvatinib (E7080) on the Pharmacokinetics of Midazolam, a CYP3A4 Substrate, in Subjects With 
Advanced Solid Tumours).  
The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of lenvatinib on cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) activity by using midazolam as a probe. The secondary objective was to assess the safety of 
lenvatinib when co-administered with midazolam to subjects with advanced solid tumours. 
The study was a multi-center, open-label, non-randomised, Phase 1 study conducted in 3 phases: a pre-
treatment Phase, a Treatment Phase, and an Extension Phase as depicted in the figure below. The pre-
randomization phase comprised 2 periods, screening and baseline. Subjects who completed the Pre-
randomization Phase entered the Treatment Phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021

In the Treatment Phase, all subjects received lenvatinib once daily (QD) in 28-day cycles and 3 single 
doses of midazolam, 1 each on Days −3, 1, and 14 of Cycle 1.

The mean PBPK model-predicted midazolam AUCR with lenvatinib was 1.18, which is in agreement with 
the observed mean AUCR of 1.14 from this clinical study, confirming that there is no clinically relevant 
effect of lenvatinib on the PK of midazolam. 
Study 307 - E7080-G000-307/KEYNOTE-581  
Study 307 determined the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus everolimus (Arm A) or pembrolizumab 
(Arm B) versus the control arm of sunitinib (Arm C). 
One of the secondary objectives of this study was to summarize serum concentrations of pembrolizumab 
obtained from subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following administration of 
pembrolizumab (200 mg pembrolizumab Q3W) in combination with lenvatinib (Eisai Study 307 
/KEYNOTE-581) and to compare observed pembrolizumab PK data in Eisai Study 307 / KEYNOTE-581 
with reference pembrolizumab model (TDPK model based) predicted PK. 
PK analysis for pembrolizumab was reported in pembrolizumab (MK-3475) PK analysis report HOPE307-
PembroPK. Over the course of clinical development of pembrolizumab, PK has been robustly 
characterized. Using a dataset with sample size of 2993 participants administered with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, a time-dependent PK model was created to describe the PK profile as indicated in the 
pembrolizumab USPI and EU SmPC. This model is used as the reference PK model to support 
pembrolizumab submissions across indications worldwide.

Observed concentration of pembrolizumab from Study 307 Arm B was compared graphically with 
historical pembrolizumab monotherapy reference existing data at the same dose level from completed 
studies. Using a dataset with sample size of 2993 participants administered with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, a time-dependent PK model was created to describe the PK profile. This model is used as 
the reference PK model to support pembrolizumab submissions across indications worldwide. 
Observed pembrolizumab concentration data in Study 307 Arm B are overlaid on the simulated profile 
using the reference model as shown in the figure below. The majority of the observed pembrolizumab 
serum concentration values are contained within the boundaries of the predicted interval using the 
reference PK model, which indicate that pembrolizumab data from study are consistent with the historical 
monotherapy data.

Concomitant pembrolizumab dosing did not affect lenvatinib PK, and exposures of pembrolizumab were 
not impacted in the presence of lenvatinib when the 2 drugs were administered as a combination therapy. 
The observed pembrolizumab concentration data in Study 307 Arm B from subjects with advanced RCC 
following administration of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) pembrolizumab therapy in combination with 20 
mg once daily (QD) lenvatinib are consistent and within the range of simulated monotherapy 
pembrolizumab PK profiles using the reference population PK model created using data from 2993 
subjects administered with pembrolizumab monotherapy regimen. 
The population PK of lenvatinib when co-administered with pembrolizumab has been characterised in 
study CPMS-E7080-012R-LP:  
CPMS-E7080-012R-LP 
The objectives of the population PK analysis of lenvatinib is to characterize the PK of lenvatinib in subjects 
with RCC when administered alone and concomitantly with either everolimus or pembrolizumab and 
compare to that in healthy subjects and subjects with other types of cancer (mainly DTC and HCC) on 
pooled data from several studies including Study 307. 
Population PK analysis of lenvatinib was based on pooled PK data from the 21 studies, including Study 
307 in RCC subjects. 
In the previous PK analysis (CPMS-E7080-013R), lenvatinib PK was best described by a 3-compartment 
model with simultaneous first and zero order absorption and linear elimination from the central 
compartment parameterized for apparent total clearance following oral administration (CL/F), apparent

volume of the central compartment (V1/F), apparent volume of peripheral compartments (V2/F and 
V3/F), inter-compartmental clearance between V1/F and V2/F and V1/F and V3/F (Q2/F and Q3/F), 
absorption rate constant (Ka), and duration of zero-order absorption (D1) and relative bioavailability 
(F1rel). PK model included the following covariates: body weight on clearances and volume parameters, 
healthy subjects on CL/F, DTC, RCC, and HCC subjects on CL/F, albumin < 30 g/L and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab First-Line Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma 2.7 Clinical

Page 15 of 27 > upper limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F, and capsule formulation 
on relative bioavailability. In the current analysis, due to the large dataset which resulted in a very long 
run time Ka, D1, F1rel, V3/F and effect of healthy subjects and CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F, which all were 
similar to those from many previous PK analyses, were fixed to those from the recent PK analysis and 
only effects of albumin, ALP and tumour type were re-evaluated in the PK model in addition to co-
medication effect of everolimus and pembrolizumab (categorical) or area under the concentration × time 
curve (AUC) of everolimus on CL/F.Estimation of model parameters was performed using first order 
conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). 
PK analysis for lenvatinib 
The final model was a 3-compartment model with simultaneous zero and first order absorption and first 
order elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL/F, V1/F, V2/F, V3/F, Q1, Q2, Ka, 
D1 and relative bioavailability (F1rel) for capsule formulation compared to tablet. The model included 
body weight as an allometric constant on clearances and volume parameters, albumin < 30 g/L and ALP 
> ULN on CL/F and CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F. In addition to the above, population effects on lenvatinib 
CL/F for RCC and HCC subjects and for healthy subjects were determined and included in the model. 
Finally, the effects of DTC and dosing (categorical) and exposure levels (AUC) of concomitant everolimus 
and concomitant pembrolizumab (categorical) were tested on lenvatinib CL/F, however, in these cases 
none was found to be significant. Population PK parameter estimates from the final model are presented 
in the table below:

The DTC population was found to have similar lenvatinib CL/F to that in patients with other cancer types 
excluding RCC and HCC. The RCC population was found to have a 14.6% lower lenvatinib CL/F compared 
with patients with DTC and other cancer types excluding HCC. The HCC population was found to have a 
12.7% lower lenvatinib CL/F compared with patients with DTC and other cancer types excluding RCC. The

magnitude of each effect is within the inter-subject variability for CL/F (%CV = 34.2 %) and hence of no 
clinical relevance. These effects are consistent with those from a recent analysis (CPMS-E7080-013R). 
Individual lenvatinib CL/F and AUC for RCC subjects receiving lenvatinib 20 mg in combination with 
pembrolizumab (Arm B) in Study 307 are summarized in Table 5. The median values and range of 
parameter values are comparable with CL/F and AUC dose-normalized to 20 mg in subjects with RCC who 
received lenvatinib monotherapy in Study 205 (Table 6), confirming the non-clinically relevant effect of 
pembrolizumab co-administration on lenvatinib exposure. The median values and range of CL/F and AUC 
for Asian (Japanese + Chinese + other Asian) and Japanese populations are comparable with overall

Figure 12 Effect of ADA on on Pembrolizumab Exposure after Pembrolizumab Combination Therapy, 200 
mg MK-3475 Q3W, in Combination with Lenvatinib (Eisai Study 307 / KEYNOTE-581) 
The evaluation has confirmed the assessment that pembrolizumab combination therapy with lenvatinib in 
subjects with advanced RCC, has a limited potential to elicit the formation of ADA and that there is no 
impact on pembrolizumab exposure in the cases where ADA formation occurs.  
The observed incidence of treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects based on a pooled analysis 
(pembrolizumab combination therapy) in subjects with advanced RCC is 0.3% (1 out of 314), based on 1 
subject with treatment emergent positive. The treatment emergent positive subject had no antibodies 
with neutralizing capacity. 
This is consistent with the low immunogenicity incidence after pembrolizumab monotherapy of prior 
immunogenicity evaluations. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total 
treatment emergent ADA (1.4 - 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis 
has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in the USPI and EU SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 37/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumour type and no clinical 
consequences have been observed in the subjects with a positive immunogenicity reading. 
Immunogenicity evaluation for study 307 
For pembrolizumab combination therapy, ADA samples were available from 343 subjects. A subset of the 
subjects was not assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity because the subjects were not treated with 
pembrolizumab or only a pre-treatment ADA sample was available (N=11). The remaining 332 subjects 
were assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity analysis. 
Table 7 Overview of Subjects Included in the Immunogenicity Analysis after Pembrolizumab Combination 
Therapy, 200 mg MK-3475 Q3W, in Combination with Lenvatinib (Eisai Study 307 / KEYNOTE-581) 
The table below presents an overview of the immunogenicity status of all assessable subjects. 
To evaluate immunogenicity, the overall immunogenicity was defined as the proportion of emergent 
positive subjects to the total number of evaluable subjects (treatment emergent positive, non-treatment 
emergent positive and negative immunogenicity status).

Impact on pembrolizumab exposure 
The effect of ADA on pembrolizumab levels, for the subjects with ADA positive samples, is compared with 
the subjects treated with the same regimen that only have ADA negative samples. For the ADA positive

subject, the pembrolizumab exposure was comparable to that for other subjects treated with the same 
regimen.

MK-3475 Q3W, in Combination with Lenvatinib (Eisai Study 307 / KEYNOTE-581) 
Impact of ADA on pembrolizumab safety and efficacy 
There was one ADA positive sample from one patient for whom no neutralising activity was detected. 
The evaluation has confirmed the assessment that pembrolizumab combination therapy with lenvatinib in 
subjects with advanced RCC has a limited potential to elicit the formation of ADA and that there is no 
impact on pembrolizumab exposure in the cases where ADA formation occurs. This is consistent with the 
low immunogenicity incidence after pembrolizumab monotherapy of prior immunogenicity evaluations. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK analysis of lenvatinib was based on PK data from the 21 studies, including study 307 in 
RCC subjects. Exposure-response analysis for AEs was based on data from Arm B of study 307.  
Objectives 
The objectives of the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of lenvatinib were to characterize the PK 
of lenvatinib in subjects with RCC when administered alone and concomitantly with either everolimus or 
pembrolizumab and compare to that in healthy subjects and subjects with other types of cancer (mainly 
DTC and HCC) on pooled data from several studies including Study 307.  
The objectives of the PK/PD analysis for safety of combination therapy of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
in subjects with RCC were to explore the relationship of lenvatinib exposure with the occurrence of 
adverse events (AEs) related to only lenvatinib in subjects with RCC, which were previously specified to 
include hypertension, proteinuria, weight decreased, vomiting and hypothyroidism (Arm B of study 307). 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 39/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The PK/PD safety analysis included data from RCC subjects from the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
combination arm from study 307. Across the lenvatinib program, including this study, safety was 
assessed by evaluation of adverse events (AE), clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry and hematology), 
urinalysis, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG), echocardiograms and other 
examinations as clinically indicated. 
Where possible AEs recorded throughout the treatment were graded on the five-point scale according to 
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0 or higher. AEs for hypertension, proteinuria, weight 
decrease, vomiting and hypothyroidism were analysed to examine their relationships with lenvatinib 
exposure. 
Baseline and covariates

Analysis of Lenvatinib from Study 307/Arms A & B (N=699) 
Results 
With the exception of hypothyroidism and to a smaller extent proteinuria, there was a generally weak, 
albeit positive relationship of TEAEs and lenvatinib AUC, with the 95% Cis for the exposure logit 
parameter including 0. For example, for hypothyroidism the probability of any Grade (1 to 3) increased 
from 56 to 75% across the exposure quantiles (table below). Proteinuria increased from 19% to 30% 
across the same lenvatinib concentration range.

Concentration Quantiles 
Age was associated with a decreased odd ratio of hypothyroidism 0.59 for subjects <65 years old. 
Proteinuria was weakly associated with a lower ECOG score, with an odds ratio of 0.45. At baseline, 
Japanese subjects were associated with a 2.5 higher odds ratio of proteinuria and hypothyroidism. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results for the combination therapy of pembrolizumab together with lenvatinib 
specific to support approval for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
are available from the pivotal study KEYNOTE-581/Study 307. 
A substantial characterization of the key clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity findings of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy have been provided in previous submissions. 
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison was conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication (RCC) in combination with 
lenvatinib and the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
data (KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024).  
Predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at 
cycles 1, 2, 3, 5 and and during the off-treatment visit after pembrolizumab discontinuation. Postdose 
serum concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the end of the infusion 
in cycle 1 and cycle 2. 
The observed concentrations in RCC patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib 
generally fall within the range of predicted concentrations, both after first dose and at steady state, 
although some low concentrations do not fall in the 90% PI. 
It is already demonstrated that RCC subjects had 14.6 % lower oral clearance than that in subjects with 
other types of tumour excluding HCC. It is agreed that the magnitude of the effect is within the inter-
subject variability for CL/F and that therefore the difference is of no clinical relevance.  
Based on the PK results of study 307 and POP PK analysis based on pooled PK data from the 21 studies, 
including Study 307, a change in the PK information of the Kisplyx SmPC is not justified.  
The information on special populations is unchanged from the original DTC (Lenvima) and RCC (Kisplyx) 
indications.  
Given the divergent metabolic pathways for both compounds, no DDI is expected on pembrolizumab and 
lenvatinib when administered in combination with each other. Treatment comparison for lenvatinib PK 
parameters showed that median lenvatinib plasma concentration-time profiles were comparable when 
lenvatinib was administered alone and with pembrolizumab. Concomitant pembrolizumab dosing did not 
affect lenvatinib PK, and exposures of pembrolizumab were not impacted in the presence of lenvatinib 
when the 2 drugs were administered as a combination therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 41/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Pembrolizumab combination therapy with lenvatinib in subjects with advanced RCC, has a limited 
potential to elicit the formation of ADA and that there is no impact on pembrolizumab exposure in the 
cases where ADA formation occurs. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The updated lenvatinib PK profile containing data from Study 307/KEYNOTE-581 is consistent with the 
current population PK profile of lenvatinib. The observed concentration from KEYNOTE-581 fall within the 
90% CI of the model predicted median concentration. 
The incidences of treatment emergent ADA is negligible when pembrolizumab is combined with lenvatinib 
which is consistent with the low immunogenicity incidence after pembrolizumab monotherapy of prior 
immunogenicity evaluations. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Study E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE 146  
Study KEYNOTE 146 (E7080 A001 111) is an ongoing, open-label Phase 1b/2 study evaluating the safety 
and efficacy of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in subjects with selected metastatic solid tumour types, 
including endometrial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, RCC, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck, and melanoma.  The primary objective of the Phase 1b part of the study 
was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for 
lenvatinib to be used in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (treatment dosage for all currently 
approved indications). 
The Phase 1b dose-finding portion of the study using a dose de-escalation strategy with a 3+3 design.  
Per protocol, in Phase 1b of this study, if ≥2 subjects at a dose level experienced dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT), the study proceeded with enrollment at the next lower dose level.  The MTD was confirmed if ≤ 3 
of the 10 evaluable subjects in a dose level experienced DLTs during the first 3 weeks of treatment (Cycle 
1). The study began with 3 subjects enrolled in the lenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg dose 
level.  There were 2 DLTs at this dose level (1 subject with Grade 3 arthralgia and another subject with 
Grade 3 fatigue) during Cycle 1. Both subjects had a dose reduction to 20 mg QD and continued to 
receive study treatment.  Ten subjects were subsequently enrolled in the lenvatinib 20 mg/day + 
pembrolizumab 200 mg dose level and no DLTs were reported.  
Based on these data, the lenvatinib 20 mg QD (starting dosage) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W has 
been implemented as the recommend dose across the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination 
program (with the exception of hepatocellular carcinoma), that currently consists of 13 Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 registration studies in a range of indications.  Lenvatinib 20 mg QD plus pembrolizumab 200 mg 
Q3W are also the approved dosages for the treatment of patients with advanced EC (in those countries 
where this indication is currently approved).

Sample size 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary endpoint of PFS. Approximately 1050 subjects were 
to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 3 treatment arms: lenvatinib + everolimus, lenvatinib + 
pembrolizumab, or sunitinib alone.  
The same treatment effect was assumed for the primary comparisons of lenvatinib + everolimus (Arm A) 
and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (Arm B) each compared to sunitinib alone (Arm C). Assuming the 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 47/144 
 
 
 
 
median PFS of sunitinib to be 12.3 months and a targeted HR of 0.714 for the primary comparisons, this 
corresponds to a 40% improvement (4.9 months) in median PFS from 12.3 months to 17.2 months for 
Arm A versus Arm C and for Arm B versus Arm C. A yearly loss of PFS event rate of 22% is assumed in 
the sample size calculation.  
Since the study was testing more than one comparison for the primary and secondary endpoints, the 
graphical approach was used for testing multiple hypotheses. For the two PFS comparisons (one for each 
test arm), the sponsor chose to split the total alpha of 0.0499 (2-sided), as initial allocations, into α = 
0.045 for the comparison between Arm B and Arm C, and α = 0.0049 for the comparison between Arm A 
and Arm C. 
The study was designed to achieve 90% power at α = 0.045 to detect a statistically significant difference 
in PFS in the comparison between Arm B and Arm C. Therefore, a total of 388 PFS events were required 
between Arms B and C in the final PFS analysis. Since the same number of PFS events were expected to 
be observed in Arms A and C, a total of 388 PFS events is expected in the final PFS analysis for the 
comparison between Arms A and C.  
The power to detect a statistically significant difference in PFS between Arm A and Arm C is 
approximately 70% at the initial assigned α = 0.0049, and would at least 90% when the hypothesis tests 
of PFS and OS in the comparison of Arm B and Arm C are statistically significant, and vice versa. In the 
power calculation for PFS analysis, it was assumed that one interim analysis of PFS is to be performed at 
the 80% information fraction and a Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary used 
between the interim and final analysis of PFS. 
Assuming an average enrollment rate of 31 subjects per month, the interim and final analysis of PFS 
would occur approximately 38 and 45 months (34-month enrollment period) after the first subject had 
been randomized. A total of 582 PFS events were expected in 3 arms by the time of planned final PFS 
analysis. 
Sample size calculation for OS 
For the key secondary endpoint of OS, a total of 304 deaths for each comparison (456 death events 
among the 3 arms) were expected in the final OS analysis. For OS testing, when the corresponding PFS 
testing is statistically significant at the initial assigned alpha, the study would provide 80% power to 
detect a statistically significant difference at an α level of 0.045 for the comparison between Arms B and 
C, and 50% power at an α level of 0.0049 for the comparison between Arm A and C. By using the 
graphical approach, the power for the OS comparison between Arms A and C would increase to at least 
80% when the OS testing between Arms B and C is significant and both PFS testings are significant, and 
vice versa. 
The assumptions that are used for the OS power calculations were: 1) the hazard ratio is 0.70 (median 
OS is 54.1 months in Arm A or Arm B and 37.9 months in Arm C), 2) interim analyses are performed at 
approximately 45%, 60%, and 80% information fraction of death events, 3) a Lan-DeMets spending 
function with Pocock boundary is used, and 4) the yearly rate for loss to follow-up is 3%.  
With the planned sample size and the assumptions for enrollment, the final analysis of OS was expected 
to occur approximately 69 months after the first subject is randomly assigned to treatment. 
For the key secondary endpoint of ORR, assuming an ORR of 32% in Arm C and 48% in Arm A or Arm B, 
the study will provide at least 95% power to detect a difference when testing of PFS and OS are positive 
for each comparison of Arm B vs Arm C and Arm A vs Arm C.

Randomisation 
Subjects were to be assigned to treatments based on a computer-generated randomization scheme that 
were reviewed and approved by an independent statistician. Randomization was to be performed centrally 
by an interactive voice and web response system (IxRS). 
Stratification 
The randomization was based on the following stratification factors:  
- Geographic region: Region 1(Western Europe and North America); Region 2 (rest of the world) 
- Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic groups: favorable, intermediate, and poor 
risk 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label to sites and investigators and was blinded to MAH clinical, biostatistics, and ICL 
personnel. The data integrity of Study 307 was maintained by 1) the Data Integrity Protection Plan, which 
detailed the masking procedures throughout the study conduct, and 2) the Operational and 
Communication Plans, which specified the operational and communication procedures that were followed 
during conduct of each of the interim analyses. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis population 
The Full Analysis Set (Intent-to-Treat Analysis [ITT] Population) was planned as the group of all 
randomized subjects regardless of the treatment received. This was planned to be the primary analysis 
population used for all efficacy analyses which was planned to be based on the intent-to-treat principle. 
Primary outcome variable: PFS 
The primary endpoint was planned to be PFS assessed by independent review (IIR), defined as the time 
from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression using 
RECIST 1.1 or death (whichever occurs first). 
Missing values and censoring of PFS 
Progression date was planned to be assigned to the earliest date when any RECIST 1.1-defined disease 
progression is observed without missing more than one adequate radiologic assessment. The following 
rules were planned be used for censoring, with a priorization described below. 
Table 11 Censoring Rules for Derivation of Progression-Free Survival  
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 49/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The priority of the censoring rules was planned as follows: 
1. If the subject had PD or death, the following sequence will be applied: 
• 
If a subject did not have a baseline tumour assessment (No. 1), the subject will be censored on 
the date of randomization. However, if the subject died within 121 days after randomization and 
did not receive a new anticancer treatment, it will be counted as PFS event at the date of death. 
If a subject had new anticancer treatment before PD or death (No. 4), the subject will be 
censored on the date of the last adequate tumour assessment prior to or on the date of new 
anticancer treatment. 
• 
If a subject missed two or more tumour assessments before PD or death (No. 7), the subject will 
be censored on the date of the last adequate tumour assessment before PD or death. Note that if 
a subject is censored by both this criterion and the anticancer treatment criterion, the earliest 
censoring date will be used. 
•  Otherwise, if a subject had an event (No. 2, No. 5, or No. 6), the earliest event date will be used. 
2. If a subject did not have PD or death, the censoring date will be the earliest censoring date if the 
subject met multiple censoring criteria (No. 1, No. 3, No. 4, No. 7). 
Key secondary outcome variable: OS 
Overall survival (OS) was planned to be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
death from any cause. Subjects who are lost to follow-up and those who are alive at the date of data cut-
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021

off were planned to be censored at the date the subject was last known alive, or date of data cut-off, 
whichever occurs first. 
Analysis model and covariates 
PFS was planned to be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates and the statistical significance of 
the difference in PFS for the 2 primary comparisons was planned to be tested by stratified logrank test. 
Geographic region and MSKCC prognostic groups were planned to be used as stratification factors for 
randomization. The hazard ratio (lenvatinib + everolimus relative to sunitinib and lenvatinib + 
pembrolizumab relative to sunitinib) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were planned 
to be estimated using the Cox regression model with Efron’s method for handling tied results, stratified 
by the same stratification factors. 
The analysis of OS was planned accordingly: 
Overall Survival (OS) was planned to be compared between lenvatinib + everolimus (Arm A) vs. sunitinib 
alone (Arm C) and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (Arm B) vs. sunitinib alone (Arm C) using the stratified 
logrank test with geographic region (Western Europe and North America vs. Other) and MSKCC 
prognostic groups (favorable, intermediate and poor risk) as strata. The hazard ratio and its 95% CI 
comparing lenvatinib + everolimus (Arm A) vs. sunitinib alone (Arm C) and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab 
(Arm B) vs. sunitinib alone (Arm C) was planned to be estimated by a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model with Efron’s method for handling tied results, stratified by geographic region and MSKCC 
prognostic groups. Median OS with 2-sided 95% CIs will be calculated using K-M product-limit estimates 
for each treatment arm and K-M estimates of OS were planned to be plotted over time. 
Multiplicity 
To adjust for multiplicity and control the overall FWER, the graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz 
(Maurer et al., 2013) will be used in the primary endpoint of PFS and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints (OS and ORR). No multiplicity adjustment will be made for other secondary endpoint analyses. 
An α of 0.0001 will be subtracted from the total α of 0.05 to account for the interim analysis of ORR from 
Arm B. Figure below shows the initial α- allocation (the remaining α of 0.0499) for each hypothesis and 
the graphical approach for multiple analyses of PFS, OS, and ORR. 
If the null hypothesis of PFS is rejected at the initial allocated alpha level 0.045 for H1 (or 0.0049 for H2), 
this alpha of 0.045 (or 0.0049) will be reallocated to the tests with the corresponding weights as shown in 
Figure 15. The initial weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented by the 
numbers next to the arrows (eg, if H1 and H3 are positive, 90% alpha will be reallocated to H2, and 10% 
to H5). An alpha level 0.045 is assigned to H1 to increase the successful rate of H1 test so that this alpha 
can be re-allocated to other hypothesis tests. When alpha is re-allocated as planned for all hypotheses, 
the PFS tests H1 and H2 will both have 90% power, OS tests H3 and H4 will both have 80% power, and 
Assessment report

the ORR tests H5 and H6 will both have more than 95% power
Figure 15 Graphical Approach to Control Familywise Error Rate for Testing 
Initially, a truncated Hochberg method was planned for the two primary comparisons of PFS (arm A vs C, 
arm B vs C) with a truncation parameter of 0.7: At the final PFS analysis, if the larger p-value for both 
comparisons is less than 0.0425, then statistical significance for both comparisons was planned to be 
declared. Otherwise, if the other p-value is less than 0.025, then statistical significance for the 
corresponding comparison was planned to be declared. 
In amendment 04, dated 30 Jun 2018, the analysis of ORR was introduced and a portion of α=0.0001 
was allocated to this analysis, leaving α=0.0499 for PFS. 
The graphical approach and bonferroni-type split of the significance level of α=0.045 for arm B vs C and 
α=0.0049 for arm A vs. C was introduced in protocol amendment 06, dated 10 Sep 2019, and replaced 
the previous strategy.

Interim analysis 
The interim efficacy analyses were planned to be conducted by an independent statistical group that has 
no other responsibilities for the study. The safety monitoring was planned to be conducted by the 
independent DMC and only the DMC was planned to have access to data with treatment information. 
The frequency of the safety reviews was planned to be defined in the DMC charter. The recommendation 
whether to stop the trial for safety reasons had to be reached by the DMC based on its review of safety 
data with treatment information. The function and membership of the DMC was planned to be described 
in the DMC charter. 
Interim analyses of PFS, OS, and ORR were planned. The timing of each analysis are summarized in table 
13 below.

An interim analysis of ORR for the first 88 subjects from the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm (Arm B) of 
this study was planned to be performed. No comparative analysis was planned to be conducted for the 
interim analysis of ORR; however, an α of 0.0001 will be allocated and deducted from the analyses of 
PFS. Details outlining how the integrity of study conduct will be maintained are described in a separate 
operational plan. This interim analysis of ORR will occur after the first 88 subjects treated in Arm B 
(lenvatinib + pembrolizumab) have completed a median follow-up of 12 months and a minimum DOR 
follow-up of 6 months.

Recruitment 
Enrolment in Study 307 occurred between 13 Oct 2016 (first subject gave informed consent) and 24 Jul 
2019 (last subject randomized). 
Data cut off for IA3 occurred on 28 Aug 2020 after 365 PFS events had been observed for the comparison 
between lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib and 396 PFS events had been observed for the 
comparison between lenvatinib plus everolimus and sunitinib. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (v1.0) was approved on 22 Jun 2016. There were 7 protocol amendments.  
Amendment 01 (26 Sep 2016) 
- 
Proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to toxicity, and time to treatment failure 
due to toxicity were added as new secondary endpoints as requested by the EMA. 
-  Characterization of the population PK of pembrolizumab was added as an exploratory objective. 
- 
Exclusion Criterion 19 was changed, and Exclusion Criterion 20 was added to clarify the exclusion 
of subjects with a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment and 
exclusion of subjects with current pneumonitis. 
Amendment 02 (03 Feb 2017) 
-  Assessment of PFS based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 was added as a secondary 
objective/endpoint as requested by the regulatory authorities. 
- 
- 
Exclusion Criterion 13 was adapted for the study indication (ie, carotid artery reference was 
deleted). 
Exclusion Criterion 27 was added to capture “known intolerance to any of the study drugs (or any 
of the excipients),” as requested by the regulatory authorities. 
-  Dose modification guidelines for holding treatment for pneumonitis were amended from “Grade 3 
to 4” to “Grade 3 to 4 or Recurrent 2.” 
- 
Pregnancy assessment was added to the Follow-up Period, as requested by the regulatory 
authorities. 
-  As requested by the regulatory authorities, the Follow-up Period for collecting SAE data was 
lengthened as follows: “SAEs regardless of causality assessment must be collected through the 
last visit and for 120 days after the subject’s last dose, or 30 days following the last dose if the 
subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.” 
- 
PK and PK/PD related exploratory objectives were recategorized from exploratory to secondary, 
and the following secondary endpoints were added as requested by the regulatory authorities: 
-  Model-predicted clearance and AUC for lenvatinib in Arms A and B. 
-  Model-predicted clearance and AUC for everolimus in Arm A and for pembrolizumab in Arm B. 
Amendment 03 (10 Jan 2018) 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 57/144 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Exclusion Criterion 15 was revised to change cardiovascular impairment window from 6 months to 
12 months, as requested by the EMA. 
-  Dose modification guidelines for pembrolizumab were updated. 
-  Guidelines for the management of proteinuria, hypertension and hemorrhage were revised. 
Amendment 04 (30 Jun 2018) 
- 
Planned enrolment was increased to 1050 subjects (approximately 350 subjects per arm) to 
address slow enrolment in the first 12 months and high loss of PFS event rate and provide 
adequate power for intergroup comparisons of OS. The planned number of investigational sites 
was increased to 200 to accommodate the delay in study enrollment. 
- 
The estimated duration of the Study Randomization Period was increased to 43 months (29-
month enrolment period; 14-month Follow-up Period). The total study period was increased to 53 
months. 
-  Specific conditions under which subjects in Arm B could receive retreatment with pembrolizumab 
with or without lenvatinib, referred to as the Second Course Phase, after discontinuation or 
completion of pembrolizumab in this study were added. 
- 
- 
Exclusion Criterion 2 was revised to clarify that CNS metastases (not just brain metastases) must 
be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting study treatment. 
Exclusion Criterion 28 was added to exclude subjects who had had an allogenic tissue/solid organ 
transplant in accordance with current pembrolizumab label. 
-  Management of proteinuria section was updated to include to clarify that lenvatinib/sunitinib must 
be discontinued in the event of nephrotic syndrome, to align with guidance in the current 
lenvatinib global investigator brochure (IB). 
- 
Two interim analyses were added: 
-  A planned interim analysis of ORR and DOR was added to include the first 88 treated subjects 
from the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm who had completed a median follow-up of 12 
months and had a minimum of 6 months follow-up for DOR. 
-  A planned interim analysis of OS was added to be performed at the time of the primary 
analysis for PFS. 
- 
- 
For the primary analysis of PFS, α was decreased to 0.0499 for all comparisons, due to the 
addition of an interim analysis to which an α of 0.0001 was allocated. 
For the multiplicity adjustment, the P value thresholds for the primary analysis of PFS were 
changed because of the addition of an interim analysis. 
Amendment 05 (19 Dec 2018) 
-  Removed the second course retreatment phase option for pembrolizumab at the assessors’ 
request following the EU member states Voluntary Harmonisation Procedure regulatory authority 
review. 
-  Updated interim analysis of ORR and DOR to clarify that the results may be considered for an 
early submission in regions outside of EMA jurisdiction. 
Amendment 06 (10 Sep 2019) 
-  Added of interim analysis of PFS and ORR 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 58/144 
 
 
 
 
-  Added of interim analysis of OS 
-  Updated multiplicity adjustment strategy for efficacy 
Amendment 07 (06 Aug 2020) 
-  Removal of the exploratory objective to assess PFS using immune-related RECIST in subjects 
treated with lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, the rate of major protocol deviations was low, and the incidence and nature of the protocol 
deviations were balanced across the treatment arms; therefore, there was no impact on the overall 
conclusions of the study. The categories for the major protocol deviations are summarized below. 
Table 15 Summary of Major Protocol Deviations - FAS 
Of the major protocol deviations described above, 1 subject in the sunitinib arm, who missed more than 1 
consecutive tumour assessment scans leading to censoring of PFS event per IIR, was associated with 
coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). 
Site Closure Due to Non-Compliance: 
Site 2906 was initiated on 29 May 2017 and enrolled a total of 11 subjects. Due to significant compliance 
issues, the enrollment was halted on 16 April 2018 and alternative arrangements for the care of 4 
ongoing subjects was put in place. A total of 3 subjects (2 with major protocol deviations and 1 who 
discontinued the study due to subject choice before receiving study drug) from this site were excluded 
from the PP analysis set; no other sensitivity analysis was considered necessary. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline demographics were generally balanced across the treatment arms. Most subjects were male, 
white, overweight with a KPS score ≥80 at study entry. Overall, the age of subjects ranged from 29 to 88 
years, with a median age of 62.0 years.

Overall, 53.1% of subjects had Stage IV disease at initial diagnosis. Most subjects had metastatic disease 
at study entry, with predominantly 2 metastatic organs/sites (37.6%); the most common metastatic site 
at baseline was lung (67.8%). Subject randomization was stratified by MSKCC prognostic group; most 
subjects (63.8%) were in the intermediate risk prognostic group. International Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group was derived programmatically and was not a 
stratification factor; most subjects (55.8%) were in the intermediate risk group, and there was a 
numerically higher proportion of subjects in the IMDC favourable risk group in the sunitinib arm. Overall, 
tumours were PD-L1 positive for 342 subjects (32.0%) and PD-L1 negative for 333 subjects (31.2%), 
while PD-L1 status was not available for 394 subjects (36.9%). 
Prior Therapy  
None of the subjects enrolled had received prior systemic anticancer therapy for RCC. The proportion of 
subjects who had a prior nephrectomy and those who received prior radiotherapy was balanced across 
the treatment arms. Overall, most subjects (74.6%) had undergone prior nephrectomy and 12.5% of 
subjects had received prior radiotherapy. 
Numbers analysed 
The full analysis set (FAS) was the primary analysis set used for efficacy analyses and the safety set was 
used for the safety analyses. The FAS consisted of 355 subjects randomly assigned to lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab, 357 to lenvatinib plus everolimus, and 357 to sunitinib. In total, 22 of these subjects did 
not receive study drug: 3 in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm, 2 in the lenvatinib plus everolimus 
arm, and 17 in the sunitinib arm. 
Therefore, the Safety Analysis Set included 352 subjects treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, 355 
subjects treated with lenvatinib plus everolimus, and 340 subjects treated with sunitinib.

Primary objective: Progression Free Survival 
Median PFS based on IIR using RECIST 1.1 was 23.9 months for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 9.2 
months for sunitinib (HR=0.39, [95% CI:  0.32, 0.49], P<0.0001]). The P value was less than the pre 
specified P value boundary of 0.0411 and the null hypothesis was rejected. Median follow-up time for PFS 
was 22.3 months (95% CI:  21.1, 25.6) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 16.6 months (95% 
CI:  13.1, 18.5) in the sunitinib arm. 
Results for PFS by investigator assessment were consistent with those of PFS by IIR.  Median PFS was 
22.1 months for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with 9.5 months for sunitinib (HR=0.47, [95% 
CI:  0.38, 0.58], nominal P<0.0001).

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the Full Analysis Set within the relevant treatment group. Per EMA guidance, 
the actual reported date of progression by independent imaging review or death regardless of missing assessments, or use of new anti-
cancer therapy were used for analysis. NE = Not Estimable; PD = Progressive Disease. a: Quartiles are estimated by Kaplan-Meier 
method, and the 95% CIs are estimated with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.b: Hazard ratio is based on a Cox 
Proportional Hazards Model including treatment group as a factor; Efron method is used for ties.c: Stratified by geographic region 
(Region 1: Western Europe and North America, Region 2: Rest of the World) and MSKCC prognostic groups (favorable, intermediate and 
poor risk) in IxRS.d: Progression-Free survival rate and 95% CIs are calculated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and 
Greenwood Formula.e: Estimates for PFS follow-up time are calculated in the same way as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS but with 
the meaning of ‘censor’ and ‘event’ status indicator reversed. 
Secondary objective: Overall Survival The OS HR of 0.66 (95% CI:  0.49, 0.88, P=0.0049) represents 
a 34% reduction in the risk of death for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib (see 
below).   
The P value was less than the pre specified P value boundary of 0.0161 and the null hypothesis was 
rejected.  Many subjects remained alive at the time of the DCO and median OS was not reached;.  OS 
rates at Months 12, 18, and 24 were higher in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm (91.4%, 87.1%, 
and 79.2%, respectively) than the sunitinib arm (80.2%, 74.4%, and 70.4%, respectively). 
The median duration of survival follow-up was similar for both arms: 26.7 months (95% CI:   25.9, 27.4) 
for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 26.3 months (95% CI:  25.4, 27.2) for sunitinib.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the Full Analysis Set within the relevant treatment group. Stable disease must be ≥7 weeks after 
randomization. Durable stable disease must be ≥23 weeks after randomization. Time to first objective response (months) = (date of first objective response – 
date of randomization + 1) × 12 / 365.25, for subjects with best overall response of CR/PR. It is censored for subjects without best overall response of CR/PR. 
Duration of objective response (months) = ‘(Date of PD/Death or Censor Date – Date of First Objective Response + 1) × 12 / 365.25, for subjects with 
objective response. CI = confidence interval, CR = complete response, IxRS = interactive voice and web response system, NE = not estimable, PD = 
progressive disease, PR = partial response, Q = quartile, RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, SD = standard deviation.a: 95% CI is 
constructed using the method of Normal Approximation.b: Odds Ratio and nominal P value are calculated using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method, 
stratified by IxRS stratification factors.c: Quartiles are estimated by Kaplan–Meier method, and the 95% CIs are estimated with a generalized Brookmeyer and 
Crowley method.+: indicates the time is censored. 
Confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by IIR in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm was higher 
the ORR in the sunitinib arm (71.0% and 36.1%, respectively).   
The odds ratio (OR) was 4.35 (95% CI:  3.16, 5.97; nominal P<0.0001) in favor of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab.  These data were consistent with the final analysis of ORR performed at IA2 (DCO 15 
Nov 2019). The proportion of subjects who achieved a confirmed CR from lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
was approximately four times higher than from sunitinib (16.1% and 4.2%, respectively).   
Responses occurred early, with a median time to first objective response in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm of 1.94 months. 
Among subjects who responded, the DOR was longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared 
with the sunitinib arm.  The median DOR in responders was 25.8 months (95% CI:  22.1, 27.9) in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 14.6 months (95% CI:  9.4, 16.7) in the sunitinib arm.

With Cancer–Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and the EQ-5D-3L with the associated Visual Analogue Scale 
(EQ-VAS).   
With a mean follow-up time of 46 weeks from baseline, the longitudinal analysis of changes from baseline 
favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for many scales, and the difference was significant for the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale as well as for symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and constipation.  From 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, time to first deterioration HRs favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for several 
measures, and the HRs indicated a significant difference for physical functioning, dyspnea and appetite 
loss.  Time to definitive deterioration results all favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, and the HRs 
indicated a significant difference for every scale except for cognitive functioning and financial difficulties.  
When compared with sunitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab had prolonged time to definitive 
deterioration of the following functions and symptoms: physical functioning (56 weeks longer), role 
functioning (27 weeks longer), social functioning (27 weeks longer), fatigue (51 weeks longer), insomnia 
(30 weeks longer), dyspnea (27 weeks longer), nausea, and vomiting (16 weeks longer), pain (14 weeks 
longer), appetite loss (10 weeks longer), diarrhea (6 weeks longer).

Design 
Study 307/KEYNOTE-581 (Study 307) is an ongoing multicenter, 
randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study evaluating lenvatinib plus 
everolimus (Arm A) or lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Arm B) versus 
sunitinib alone (Arm C) as first-line treatment in advanced renal cell 
carcinoma.  This submission is for the combination of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab, as such, the focus for efficacy data is the comparison 
of Arm B and Arm C. 
Primary objective: to determine the superiority of either combination 
relative to sunitinib alone in improving progression-free survival (PFS).  
Key secondary efficacy objectives were to assess overall survival (OS) 
and objective response rate (ORR).

a. Quartiles are estimated by Kaplan–Meier method, and the 95% CIs are estimated with a 
generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method. 
b.Hazard ratio is based on a Cox Proportional Hazard Model including treatment group as a 
factor, Efron method is used for ties. 
c.Stratified by geographic region (Region 1:  Western Europe and North America, Region 
2:  rest of the world) and MSKCC prognostic groups (favorable, intermediate, and poor 
risk) in IxRS. 
d.95% CI is constructed using the method of Normal Approximation. 
e.Odds Ratio and nominal P value are calculated using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel 
method, stratified by IxRS stratification factors.  At the earlier pre-specified final analysis 
of ORR (median follow-up time of 17.3 months), statistically significant superiority was 
achieved for ORR comparing lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab with sunitinib (odds ratio: 
3.84 [95% CI: 2.81, 5.26], P value <0.0001).

To establish the contribution of the individual components pembrolizumab and lenvantinib to the 
pembro+lenvatinib regimen in 1L advanced RCC, Keynote-581/Study307 results were assessed relative

to lenvatinib monotherapy data from the 2L Study 205 and pembrolizumab monotherapy data from study  
Keynote-427 in 1L advanced RCC, respectively. Key details of the study design, primary and secondary 
objectives of KEYNOTE-581, Study 205 and KEYNOTE-427 are summarized in Table 27.  
Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies - Assessment of the Contribution of 
Components 
Comparison of key features of Study 307 versus Study 205 and KEYNOTE-427 
A major difference in entry criteria between Study 307 and KN-427 versus Study 205 is that both Study 
307 and KN-427 recruited subjects receiving 1L systemic therapy for RCC, while Study 205 enrolled 
subjects that had received 1 prior VEGF-targeted treatment.   
Lenvatinib was administered at different doses in Study 307 and Study 205; the RP2D of lenvatinib in 
combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg in Study 111 (20 mg QD) is lower than the monotherapy 
dosage used in Study 205 (24 mg QD), however, this is unlikely to account for the difference in activity 
observed with the combination.  Pembrolizumab was administered at a dose of 200 mg in both Study 307 
and KN-427.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current application concerns lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab for adults with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as first-line treatment.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study 307 is an multicentre, randomized, open-label, 3 arm Phase 3 study. 
The study randomized 1,069 subjects with advanced RCC in total.  A total of 355 subjects were 
randomized 1:1:1 to receive lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, 357 subjects were allocated to receive 
lenvatinib plus everolimus, and 357 subjects were allocated to receive sunitinib, in the 1L setting. Arm A 
of the study (lenvatinib and everolimus) is not part of the current submission. The ITT population includes 
355 subjects in lenvatinib and pembrolizumab (arm B) and 357 subjects in the sunitinib arm (arm C). 
Three subjects (0.8%) in arm B ad 17 (4.8%) subjects in arm C were not treated.  
Study participants included adult male and female subjects with advanced RCC with without prior 
systemic anti-cancer therapy. To be included, patients should have had a KPS of ≥70, histologically or 
cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced RCC with clear-cell subtype component and no evidence of 
significant cardiovascular impairment within 12 months prior study. Subjects were stratified by 
geographic region (Western Europe and North America or rest of the world) and MSKCC prognostic group

(favorable, intermediate, and poor risk). The IMDC risk group was derived programmatically and was not 
a stratification factor. 
Sunitinib is considered to be an acceptable comparator in the target population as the study started 
inclusion in 2016. The shift to new standard of care in first line RCC across IMDC risk categories to 
combination regimens (pembrolizumab + axitinib or nivolumab + ipilimumab) occurred in European 
guidelines (ESMO, EAU) during 2018, 2019 and 2020.  
The MAH bases the lenvatinib dose selection on the phase 1b/2 E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE 146 study. No 
DLT as defined by the protocol were observed at 20 mg lenvatinib dose level (in combination with 200 mg 
pembrolizumab Q3W). The overall rate of dose reductions and interruptions due to TEAE was overall high 
(67% of patients) with 20 mg lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab (Study 111 CSR).  
The primary objective of Study 307 was to demonstrate that lenvatinib plus everolimus or lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab is superior to sunitinib alone in improving PFS (by independent imaging review using 
RECIST version 1.1). OS, ORR, DoR, and safety were secondary outcomes. PFS as primary objective is 
considered appropriate since OS is defined as a secondary objective. 
All efficacy analyses were to be carried out using the treatment arm as randomised (intent to treat). 
Overall, the statistical analyses are considered appropriate and the sample size calculations can be 
endorsed. 
Seven amendments have been done since the original protocol. The amendments were done to clarify 
inclusion/exclusion criteria or to adapt the HA requests. The amendment 4 increased the planned 
enrolment to 1050 subjects from 735 initially planned to address slow enrolment and provide adequate 
power for OS comparisons. Amendment 7 has been performed to exclude the assessment of PFS and ORR 
based on irRECIST in arm B. The amendment was issued three weeks before 28 Aug 2020 (data cutoff for 
the final PFS analysis and second interim analysis of OS; interim analysis 3 [IA3]).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cutoff for the primary analysis occurred on 28 August 2020. Median duration of follow-up for 
PFS was 22.3 months for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination and 16.6 months for sunitinib;  
At the time of DCO study treatment was ongoing for 40% in lenvatinib and pembrolizumab arm and 18.8 
for sunitinib arm.  
Baseline demographics were generally balanced across the treatment arms. Most subjects were male, 
white, overweight with a favourable KPS score ≥80 at study entry. The median age was 62.0 years. The 
baseline distribution of European patients are not available since the grouping was based on Western 
Europe and North America and the rest of the world.  
The majority of patients had intermediate and favourable risk as per MSKCC at baseline, with less than 
10% of patients having poor risk. Approximately one third of patients had either combined positive score 
(CPS)≥1, <1 or unknown status each. All but one patient had clear cell carcinoma histology subtype, and 
49 patients had clear cell RCC with sarcomatoid features: 28 (7.9%) in lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm 
and 21 (5,9%) in sunitinib arm. Except for International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database 
Consortium (IMDC) poor risk group (9.3% in lenvatinib arm and 10,4% in sunitinib arm), the disease 
baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arm B and arm C of 307 study. 
Primary endpoint: PFS

Acceptable mature PFS results (event rate pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 45.1%; sunitinib: 57.4%) show a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS per IIR for pembrolizumab+ lenvatinib compared with 
sunitinib. There was a clear, early separation (from 2 months on) of the PFS KM curves that widened over 
time (Figure 5.4. 3). Results for PFS by investigator assessment were consistent with those of PFS by IIR. 
Median PFS was 23.9 months for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with 9.2 months for sunitinib 
(HR=0.39, [95% CI:  0.32, 0.49], nominal P<0.0001   This PFS benefit can be regarded as clinically 
relevant. 
Key secondary endpoint-Overall survival 
Median OS was not reached at the time of DCO. Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab treatment resulted in 
higher and statistically significant OS rates compared with sunitinib alone.  
The OS HR of 0.66 (95% CI:  0.49, 0.88) represents a statistically significant reduction in the risk of 
death for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib. The P value was less than the pre 
specified P value boundary of 0.0161 and the null hypothesis was rejected.   
The separation of KM curves appears to occur early after 3 months from randomization. No clear 
separation is observed before 3 months. Extensive censoring after approximately month 12 can be 
observed. 
The data are immature with about 20-30% events; however, a clear separation of the curves over time is 
apparent. Since median OS was not reached, there is an uncertainty in interpretation of the OS results.  
In the subgroup analysis DCO 28 August 2020, OS HRs for most subgroups favored (HR < 1) lenvatinib 
and pembrolizumab vs sunitinib with the exception of favourable IMDC risk groups.  
In the initial data package, the OS data for all subgroups were immature as median OS was not reached 
for several subgroup in both arms. Updated data for OS were submitted during the procedure (see 
Conclusion of Clinical Efficacy).  
Key secondary endpoint-Objective response rate 
ORR as assessed by IIR was also statistically significantly higher with pembrolizumab+lenvatinib 
compared to sunitinib: 71.0% vs 36.1%. In addition, more patients in the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib arm 
had a CR compared to the sunitinib arm: 16.1% vs 4.2%. The investigator-assessed ORR results were 
confirmatory. Among subjects who responded, the DOR was longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
arm compared with the sunitinib arm.  The median DOR in responders was 25.8 months (95% CI:  22.1, 
27.9) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 14.6 months (95% CI:  9.4, 16.7) in the sunitinib 
arm. 
Secondary endpoint  
PFS2 In the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab arm, the most frequent systemic (30.4%) anticancer therapy 
administered after study drug were VEGF inhibitors; 8.2% patients received checkpoint inhibitors. In the 
sunitinib arm, 33.6% of the patients received a VEGF inhibitor and 43.1% received checkpoint inhibitors.  
The PFS2 did not reach the median in the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab arm; the PFS2 analysis favors 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab when compared with sunitinib (HR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.65). The 
immaturity of the data and the different anti-cancer treatments used as second line contributes to an 
uncertainty in interpretation of the PFS2. 
The mPFS, OS, ORR and mDOR were favourable in the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab arm compared with 
sunitinib, independently of the PD-L1 tumour expression (CPS≥1, <1 or unknown status).  
There was low incidence of treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects based on a pooled analysis 
(pembrolizumab combination therapy) in subjects with advanced RCC.

Contribution of each component in the combination regimen 
The clinical trial design of the study 307 is lacking a monotherapy arm, testing the combination lenvatinib 
and pembrolizumab against either lenvatinib and pembrolizumab alone.  This leads to uncertainties when 
it comes to reaching a conclusion on the contribution of each agent to the combination. The MAH has 
provided cross trial comparisons. 
To justify the contribution of lenvatinib the MAH provided results from study 205. This is a completed, 
multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study of lenvatinib administered alone and in combination with 
everolimus in subjects with unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC (predominantly clear-cell) following 
1 prior VEGF-targeted treatment. The results of this trial led to approval of lenvatinib in combination with 
everolimus in RCC as 2L, after failure of VEGF targeted therapy.  
To assess the contribution of pembrolizumab, the MAH summarised results from study KN-427 (an 
ongoing, multicenter, single arm, open-label, Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab 
(200 mg Q3W) in adults with 1L locally advanced or metastatic RCC.  
A precise quantitative assessment of the contribution of each component of the 
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib combination cannot be established. However the additive efficacy of both 
individual components has sufficiently been shown in a qualitative sense based primarily on a substantial 
increase in ORR over the individual agents, even though based on cross-study comparisons only. 
Numerically higher PFS, OS and ORR were observed in lenvatinib and pembrolizumab arm in study 307 
than in study 205 or in study KN-427.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with RCC as first line therapy demonstrated 
superiority with regard to PFS over sunitinib therapy. This is supported by the ORR results. In addition, 
there is an OS survival improvement observed with HR of 0.66 (95% CI:  0.49, 0.88). However, OS data 
are still immature and mOS was not reached in key subgroups. An updated OS analysis with the data cut-
off date of 31 March 2021 was provided: HR for OS was 0.72 (0.55, 0.93), in line with the IA3 results. 
Study 307 lacked monotherapy controls, hampering the assessment of contribution of components to the 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination. Cross-trial comparisons have been provided however 
evaluation of contribution of lenvatinib, either additive or synergic to pembrolizumab, has limitations due 
to the fact that 1L therapy in study 307 is being compared with 2L therapy in study 205. Nevertheless, 
the numerically higher PFS, OS and ORR for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in study 307 compared with 
lenvatinib monotherapy (2L) or pembrolizumab (1L) study comparison can be viewed as supportive.  
In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Kisplyx in combination with pembrolizumab in the MSKCC 
favourable prognosis subgroups in first line treatment of adults patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), the MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis from the E7080-G000-
307/KEYNOTE 581 study which is comparing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination 
with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus everolimus vs. sunitinib monotherapy as a first-Line treatment of 
patients with advanced RCC.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary data to support the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC indication are from the 
ongoing, open-label, phase 3 Study 307 (KEYNOTE-581). Safety data from 352 subjects enrolled in Arm B 
of Study 307 who received at least 1 dose of either study drug (lenvatinib or pembrolizumab) and 340 
subjects enrolled in Arm C who received at least 1 dose of sunitinib were used for the safety assessment 
in this submission: 
• 
Indication Safety Set (N=352): All subjects from Study 307 with 1L RCC who received at least 1 
dose of lenvatinib 20 mg or pembrolizumab 200 mg as of the data cutoff date of 28 Aug 2020.  
•  Sunitinib Safety Set (N=340): All subjects from Study 307 with 1L RCC who received at least 1 
dose of sunitinib 50 mg. 
Further safety data are presented from the 
•  All RCC Safety Set (N=497): Subjects from Study 307 and Study 111 with RCC who received at 
least 1 dose of lenvatinib 20 mg QD + pembrolizumab 200 mg as starting dose, regardless of prior 
anticancer therapy.  
•  Non-RCC Safety Set (N=215): Subjects in non-RCC cohorts (NSCLC, endometrial carcinoma, 
urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma) from Study 111 and 
Study 115 who were treated with lenvatinib 20 mg QD + pembrolizumab 200 mg as starting dose. 
•  Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (N=1119): All subjects with starting dose level of lenvatinib 
24 mg QD monotherapy from 11 studies. 
•  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A Safety Set (N=2799): Subjects treated with pembrolizumab 
in studies KN001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3, KN002 (original phase), KN006, and KN010, 
including 1567 subjects with advanced melanoma and 1232 subjects with NSCLC. 
•  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B Safety Set (N=5884): Subjects treated with 
pembrolizumab, including 5884 subjects from studies of melanoma, NSCLC, cHL, urothelial cancer, 
and HNSCC in EU-approved indications. 
Safety data from the Indication Safety Set are assessed relative to the data from the Lenvatinib and 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets. 
Patient exposure 
At the time of data cut-off (28-Aug-2020), the median duration of treatment was 17.00 months in 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and was 7.84 months in the sunitinib arm.  
The median duration of treatment with each individual study drug was longer in the Indication Safety Set 
than in the respective monotherapy safety sets: 16.13 months and 5.55 months, respectively, for 
lenvatinib; 15.08 months and 4.86 months (RSD-B), respectively, for pembrolizumab (Table 34).  
In the Indication Safety Set, similar percentages of subjects received lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
beyond 1 year: 64.2%, 44.0%, and 29.0% of subjects received lenvatinib for ≥12 months, ≥18 months,

and ≥24 months, respectively, and 60.5%, 39.8%, and 15.6% of subjects received pembrolizumab for 
≥12 months, ≥18 months, and ≥24 months, respectively. 
Table 34 Duration of treatment by safety set 
In the Indication Safety Set, the median percentage of the planned dose of lenvatinib received was 
69.65% and the median dose intensity was 13.93 mg per day. In the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set, where subjects received a higher starting dose of lenvatinib (24 mg), the median percentage of 
planned dose and the median dose intensity were higher (83.61% and 20.07 mg per day, respectively) 
(Table 35).  
The median dose intensity of sunitinib was 83.18% of intended dose (41.59 mg/day dose intensity per 
subject).

In the Indication Safety Set, the median number of doses of pembrolizumab per subject was 22.0 doses, 
higher than that in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets, where the median 
number of doses was 7.0 and 8.0 doses, respectively.

For discontinuation of drug or dose reductions and interruptions due to AEs, please see separate section 
below. 
Characteristics of Study Population 
Of the 352 subjects in the Indication Safety Set, the majority were overweight, white and male, and the 
overall median age was 63.5 years.  Demographic characteristics of the Indication Safety Set were 
generally consistent with those of the Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets, with the 
following exceptions: 
•  A higher proportion of male subjects were included in the Indication Safety Set (71.6%) than in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy and Pembrolizumab (RSD-A and RSD B) Monotherapy Safety Sets (49.5%, 
59.3%, and 66.1%, respectively).  Also, a greater proportion of subjects had baseline hypertension 
and impaired renal function (ie, a CrCl of <60 mL/min) in the Indication Safety Set (57.4% and 
30.1%, respectively) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (47.3% and 14.0%, respectively; 
no data available for Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets). These differences are expected 
considering the disease under study. 
• 
The proportion of subjects from the Rest of World geographic region was higher in the Indication 
Safety Set (44.0%) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and 
RSD-B) Safety Sets (24.8%, 17.0%, and 27.2%).

Adverse events  
AEs were defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in a physical sign(s) or symptom(s), or a 
clinically significant laboratory change occurring in a subject during clinical study participation, regardless 
of its relationship to study drug or if due to progression of disease (PD). 
In Study 307, PD was monitored as part of the efficacy assessments and was not recorded as an AE, 
unless malignant neoplasm progression was the only term the study investigator could use to describe a 
fatal event. However, if PD led to an untoward medical occurrence (eg, increased pain, pleural effusion), 
the medical occurrence itself was recorded as an AE.  
The analysis of AEs was based on TEAEs, which were considered any of the following:  
•  An AE that emerged during treatment (up to 30 days after the subject’s last dose of study drug), 
having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline).  
•  An  AE  that  reemerged  during  treatment  or  up  to  30  days  following  the  last  dose  of  study  drug, 
having been present at pretreatment (Baseline), but stopped before treatment.  
•  An AE that worsened in severity during treatment or up to 30 days following last dose of study drug 
relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE was continuing.  
SAEs were defined as any AE that resulted in death or was otherwise life threatening, that required 
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization, that resulted in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, that  resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or which was an important 
medical event that could jeopardize the subject or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
any of the outcomes listed above. 
SAEs were collected through the termination visit and for 30 days (lenvatinib monotherapy studies), 90 
days (Studies 111 and 115, and pembrolizumab monotherapy studies), or 120 days (Study 307) after the 
last dose of study drug (or 30 days following the last dose if the subject initiated new anticancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier). All were followed to resolution or, if resolution was unlikely, to stabilization.

Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs sunitinib 
Nearly all subjects in both the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms had at least 1 TEAE 
(99.7% vs 98.5%) and related TEAE (96.9% vs 92.1%). For other AE categories higher incidences were 
reported in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared to the sunitinib arm, including Grade ≥3 
and related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% vs 71.8% and 71.6% vs. 58.8%), non-fatal SAEs (50.0% vs 
32.6%), and TEAEs leading  to discontinuation of either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab (37.2% vs 14.4%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of all study drugs was similar in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms (13.4% vs 14.4% of subjects). TEAEs leading to dose reduction of 
lenvatinib in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm occurred in 68.8% of subjects, which was higher 
than in the sunitinib arm (50.3% of subjects). TEAEs leading to dose interruption of either study drug in 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm occurred in 78.4% of subjects, which was higher than in the 
sunitinib arm (53.8% of subjects). Fatal TEAEs (Grade 5) were reported in 15 subjects (4.3%) in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm, which was similar to 11 subjects (3.2%) in the sunitinib arm.  
Adjusted by drug exposure, the rates of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was comparable at 1.95 and 2.06 per SY but 
remained numerically higher for SAEs (0.72 vs 0.55 per SY) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively. 
Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs lenvatinib or pembrolizumab monotherapy  
The incidences of most TEAEs categories were similar between the Indication Safety Set and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, including any TEAEs (99.7% and 99.0%, respectively), treatment-
related TEAEs (96.9% and 94.7%), Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% and 80.3%), nonfatal SAEs (50.0% and 
51.8%), and fatal AEs (4.3% and 8.7%). The rate of related Grade ≥3 TEAEs was numerically higher in 
the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (71.6% and 64.7%), 
mainly driven by Grade 4 events (11.6% and 4.7%). Adjusted by drug exposure, incidences for all TEAEs

categories were numerically lower in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Set.     
The comparison of the Indication Safety Set with pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated 
considerably lower incidences for pembrolizumab monotherapy across all TEAEs categories.

In the Indication Safety Set, the most commonly reported (occurring in >30% of subjects) TEAEs, by 
decreasing incidence, were diarrhoea (61.4%), hypertension (55.4%), hypothyroidism (47.2%), 
decreased appetite (40.3%), fatigue (40.1%), nausea (35.8%), and stomatitis (34.7%) (Table 39). 
For sunitinib the most commonly reported TEAEs (>30%) were diarrhea (49.4%), hypertension (41.5%), 
stomatitis (38.5%), PPE (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) syndrome (37.4%), fatigue (36.8%), 
nausea (33.2%), and decreased appetite (30.9%).  
TEAEs that occurred at a higher incidence in subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared 
with the sunitinib arm (≥10% difference) were diarrhoea (61.4% vs 49.4%), hypertension (55.4% vs 
41.5%), hypothyroidism (47.2% vs 26.5%), abdominal pain (21% vs 8.2%), weight decreased (29.8% 
vs 9.1%), arthralgia (28.1% vs 15.3%), myalgia (15.9% vs 3.5%), proteinuria (29.5% vs 12.6%), 
dysphonia (29.8% vs 4.1%), and rash (27.3% vs 13.8%); additional notable TEAEs that occurred in 
subjects at a higher incidence but <10% difference included lipase increased (18.2% vs 12.9%), amylase 
increased (17.9% vs 8.2%), adrenal insufficiency (4.8% vs 0%), and pneumonitis (5.1% vs 0%). 
When adjusted by episodes per treatment duration, the rates of aforementioned TEAEs became 
comparable between the two arms for the most frequently reported TEAEs: diarrhoea, hypertension, 
hypothyroidism, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea and stomatitis. The rates remain higher in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared to the sunitinib arm for dysphonia (0.26 vs 0.05 per SY), 
weight decreased (0.24 vs 0.09 per SY), proteinuria (0.37 vs 0.22 per SY), myalgia (0.12 vs 0.05 per 
SY), amylase increased (0.20 vs 0.12 per SY), adrenal insufficiency (0.04 vs 0 per SY), and pneumonitis 
(0.04 vs 0 per SY). 
Common TEAEs with a higher incidence in the Indication Safety Set than in the monotherapy safety sets 
included diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, increased lipase, increase amylase, increased blood creatinine, 
increased ALT and AST, hyperthyroidism, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, rash and 
maculopapular rash, hyperkalaemia, and hypophosphatemia.

The most common treatment-related TEAEs (≥30% of subjects in either arm) in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm and sunitinib arm, in decreasing incidence, were diarrhea (54.5% vs 44.4%), 
hypertension (52.3% vs 39.1%), hypothyroidism (42.6% vs 23.2%), stomatitis (32.1% vs 37.4%), 
fatigue (32.1% vs 32.1%), decreased appetite (34.9% vs 24.7%), and PPE (28.1% vs 35.9%). 
The incidence of treatment related TEAEs in the Indication Safety Set were generally consistent with that 
in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy or Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety (RSD-A and RSD-B) Sets, with the 
exceptions of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Diarrhoea (54.5%, 45.4%, 12.3%, and 10.7%, respectively) 
Hypothyroidism (42.6%, 11.1%, 7.6%, and 9.6%, respectively) 
Increased amylase (15.1%, 0.9%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, respectively)  
Increased lipase (14.2%, 2.8%, 0.1%, and 0.3%, respectively) 
COVID-19 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
TEAEs due to COVID-19 were reported in 1 subject (0.3%) each in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
arm and the sunitinib arm; both cases reported a Grade 2 TEAE of COVID-19 pneumonia that were 
considered by the investigator not to be related to study drug. Study treatment was interrupted for both 
subjects but was resumed upon recovery at the same dose; both subjects continued on treatment as of 
the data cut-off date.

Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in 82.4% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 
71.8% of subjects in the sunitinib arm; the rate of severe TEAE episodes adjusted for treatment duration 
was similar between the 2 arms (1.95 and 2.06 per SY, respectively). 
Compared to the Indication Safety Set, the incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was similar in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set (80.3%), but lower for Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A (45.5%) and RSD-B 
(48.1%).  
Related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were numerically highest in the Indication Safety Set (71.6% vs. 58.5% for 
sunitinib, 64.7% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and only 15.6% for Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy).  
Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 63.4% and 59.1% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively. The most common Grade 3 TEAEs (≥5% of subjects in either arm) in 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms, respectively, were: hypertension (27.6% vs 18.8%), 
diarrhea (9.7% vs 5.0%), weight decreased (8.0% vs 0.3%), proteinuria (7.7% vs 2.9%), amylase 
increased (7.4% vs 2.1%), lipase increased (7.1% vs 6.2%), and asthenia (5.4% vs 4.4%). 
Grade 4 TEAEs occurred in 14.8% of subjects in the combination arm and 9.4% of subjects in the 
sunitinib arm. The only Grade 4 TEAEs that occurred in 1% or more of subjects in the combination or 
sunitinib arms, respectively, were lipase increased (5.7% vs 2.6%) and amylase increased (1.7% vs 
0.9%). 
The incidence and type of Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs observed in the Indication Safety Set were 
generally consistent with one or more monotherapy safety sets except for the following TEAEs:  increased 
lipase and increased amylase, QT prolongation, pancreatitis, increased ALT and increased AST, adrenal 
insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction, rash, and renal failure (see Table 43).

•  Treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs 
In the Indication Safety Set, most common Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
were hypertension (25.3%), diarrhea (8.2%), proteinuria (7.4%), increased amylase and decreased weight 
(6.0% each), and increased lipase (5.4%). The only treatment related Grade 4 TEAEs that occurred in 3 or 
more subjects in the Indication Safety Set were increased lipase (4.3%), increased amylase (1.4%), and 
decreased neutrophil count and hyperlipasemia (0.9% each). 
The  incidence  and  type  of  severe  treatment-related  TEAEs  observed  in  the  Indication  Safety  Set  was 
generally consistent with that in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy or Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and 
RSD-B)  Safety  Sets,  with  the  following  exceptions:    increased  lipase  (9.7%,  1.1%,  <0.1%,  and  0.2%, 
respectively)  and  increased  amylase  (7.4%,  0.4%,  <0.1%,  and  0.1%,  respectively).  These  findings  are 
consistent with those for overall severe TEAEs. 
ADRs pooled across RCC participants to support update of SmPC  
The Applicant provided a tabular summary of adverse reactions which were used to update section 4.8, and 
more in particular the column with pembrolizumab/lenvatinib combination therapy in RCC (SmPC Table 4).  
Pooling comprised of subjects from Study 307 and Study 111 with RCC who  received at least 1 dose of

lenvatinib 20 mg QD + pembrolizumab 200 mg as starting dose, regardless of prior anticancer therapy. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Nonfatal SAEs were reported in 50.0% and 32.6% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively; the rate of nonfatal SAE episodes adjusted for treatment duration was 0.68 
and 0.51 per SY, respectively. 
In the Indication Safety Set, the most frequently reported nonfatal SAEs (occurring in >2% of subjects) 
were diarrhoea (3.4%), vomiting (2.8%), pneumonitis (2.6%), and acute kidney injury and hypertension 
(2.3% each).   
SAEs that occurred at a higher incidence in subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared 
with the sunitinib arm, respectively, were: diarrhoea (3.4% vs 1.2%), pneumonitis (2.6% vs 0%), 
vomiting (2.8% vs 0.9%), acute kidney injury (2.3% vs 1.2%), hypertension (2.3% vs 0.6%), adrenal 
insufficiency (2.0% vs 0%), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs 0.3%), acute myocardial infarction (1.4% vs 
0%), immune-mediated hepatitis and lipase increased (1.1% vs 0% for both), renal failure (1.1% vs 
0.6%), and pancreatitis (1.7% vs 0%).

•  Drug-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 33.8% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 
15.0%  of  subjects  in  the  sunitinib  arm.  In  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  arm,  the  most  frequently 
reported treatment-related SAEs (occurring in >1% of subjects) were diarrhoea (2.8%), vomiting (2%), 
hypertension (2%), and nausea, acute kidney injury, and myocardial infarction (1.1% each). In the sunitinib 
arm, pyrexia (1.5%) was the only related SAEs that occurred >1%. 
Deaths 
[Methodology: Progressive disease (PD) was monitored as part of the efficacy assessments and was not 
recorded as an AE, unless malignant neoplasm progression was the only term the study investigator could 
use to describe a fatal event. If PD led to an untoward medical occurrence (eg, pleural effusion, spinal 
cord compression), the medical occurrence was recorded as an AE. All death events, other than the 
reported terms of “malignant neoplasm progression”, are included in the frequency count of fatal TEAEs.] 
AEs with Fatal Outcome in the Indication Safety Set (N=27) 
•  Malignant Neoplasm Progression (N=12)  
•  Other Fatal AEs (N=15) 
o  Due to PD (N=5) 
o  Treatment Related (N=4) 
o  Not Related to Treatment or PD (N=6) 
Treatment emergent deaths were reported for 27 subjects (7.7%) in the Indication Safety Set. Out of 
these 27 subjects, 12 (3.4%) deaths were reported to be due to ‘malignant neoplasm progression’ (no 
further discussion provided).  
Among the 15 subjects with other fatal AEs (4.3%) in the Indication Safety Set, 5 subjects (1.4%) had 
other TEAEs that were associated with PD (dyspnoea, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, multiple 
organ dysfunction, and arrhythmia/cardio-respiratory arrest). Four subjects (1.1%) had fatal AEs 
attributed to study drug by the investigator (increased blood creatinine, hypertensive crisis, and 
myasthenic syndrome reported in 1 subject each and 1 subject who had a fatal AE of autoimmune 
hepatitis along with fatal AEs of myocarditis, pneumonitis, and nephritis).  
Six subjects in the Indication Safety Set had fatal AEs that were neither attributed by the investigator to 
study treatment nor to PD (subarachnoid haemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, Klebsiella sepsis, and death 
(unknown cause), reported in 1 subject each; and sepsis reported in 2 subjects). Sponsor assessment of 
attribution for these events was consistent with the investigator assessment except for the event of 
subarachnoid haemorrhage. Haemorrhagic events is a CSE for lenvatinib and this subject experienced 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 112/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subarachnoid haemorrhage during Cycle 14 in the setting of elevated BP while on study drugs; therefore, 
the sponsor considered subarachnoid hemorrhage as related to study treatment. 
The incidence of fatal AEs, excluding ‘malignant neoplasm progression’, was 4.3% in the Indication Safety 
Set, 3.2% in the sunitinib arm, 8.7% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, and 3.9% and 5.3%, 
respectively, in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets, indicating that there is 
no increased risk of fatal AEs with combination therapy. The same was observed when adjusted for 
exposure, the rate of fatal AEs was 0.04 episodes per subject-year in the Indication Safety Set, 0.03 in 
the sunitinib arm and 0.09, 0.06, and 0.08 episodes per subject-year in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy and 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets, respectively.

hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal perforation, fistula formation, hemorrhage, hepatotoxicity, hypertension, 
hypocalcemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES), proteinuria, QT prolongation, and renal events. 
The overall incidence of CSEs of all grades, serious CSEs, and CSEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
were generally similar in the Indication and Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets.  In the Indication Safety 
Set, most of the Grade ≥3 CSEs were Grade 3. CSE leading to dose reductions were higher in the 
Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets. 
Fourteen (4.0%) subjects had Grade 4 CSEs:  arterial thromboembolic events (3 subjects), 
hepatotoxicity events (5 subjects), hypertension events (1 subject), hypocalcemia events (1 subject), 
PRES events (1 subject), and renal events (3 subjects).   
Five (1.4%) subjects had fatal events in the following CSE categories:  hemorrhage events (2 subjects:  
PT ruptured aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage), hepatotoxicity events (1 subject:  PT autoimmune 
hepatitis), hypertension events (1 subject:  PT hypertensive crisis), and renal events (2 subjects:  PT 
increased blood creatinine and nephritis).

Higher incidences in the Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set were 
reported for the CSEs of hypothyroidism, renal events, and hepatotoxicity (see discussion below).  CSEs 
of hypothyroidism and hepatotoxicity occurred at a similar incidence in the Indication Safety Set and the 
Non-RCC Safety Set; both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab are associated with hypothyroidism and liver 
toxicity.   
Similar incidences in the Indication Safety Set and the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set are noted for 
all other CSEs. QT prolongation, arterial thromboembolic events, and cardiac dysfunction are discussed 
further because of their clinical relevance. 
Hypothyroidism 
Thyroid dysfunction is a known class effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors due to the antiangiogenic effect 
on the thyroid blood vessels. Hypothyroidism is also an AEOSI for pembrolizumab. 
The incidence of the CSE of hypothyroidism in the Indication Safety Set (56.8%) was higher than that in 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and similar to that in the Non-RCC Safety Set (19.8% and 47.0%, 
respectively). Of note, approximately half of subjects in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set had 
thyroid cancers, likely had thyroid resection and/or radio iodine ablation, and were, therefore, already 
receiving thyroid replacement therapy. The majority of CSE of hypothyroidism in the Indication Safety Set 
were Grade 1 (14.5%) or Grade 2 (40.9%); the incidence of Grade 3 events was 1.4% in the Indication 
Safety Set, 0.8% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, and 0.5% in the Non-RCC Safety Set.

Renal events 
The incidence of the CSE of Renal events in the Indication Safety Set (22.2%) was higher than that in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (10.0%) and the Non-RCC Safety Set (12.1%;) but similar compared 
to the All RCC Safety Set (22.5%).  
The majority of renal events in the Indication Safety Set were Grade 1 (9.4%) or Grade 2 (7.1%). Grade 
3 and 4 events were reported with 4.3% and 0.9% (compared to 2.2% and 0.2% in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set). Reported incidences in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set were: 4.3% vs. 2.4% for SAEs, 1.7% vs. 0.4% for discontinuations of lenvatinib, 
and 5.1% vs. 1.9% for dose interruptions of lenvatinib.   
Higher incidences in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set were 
reported for the preferred terms increased blood creatinine (13.6% vs 4.8%), and renal failure (2.8% vs 
0.9%). In the All RCC Safety Set, rate of increased blood creatinine was 14.9% and rate of renal failure 
was 2.6%. Acute kidney injury was reported in 3.7% in the Indication Safety Set vs 2.9% in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. Serious TEAEs of acute kidney injury were reported for 2.3% of 
subjects in the Indication Safety Set (and 1.8% of subjects in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set).  
Hepatotoxicity 
The incidence of the CSE of hepatotoxicity in the Indication Safety Set (27.3%) was higher than that in 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (17.5%) but similar compared to the Non RCC Safety Set 
(22.8%). The majority of events were Grade 1 (9.1%) or Grade 2 (8.2%) in the Indication Safety Set. 
Grade 3 events were 8.2% and 4.7%, Grade 4 events 1.4% and 0.4% in the Indication Safety Set and 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, respectively. One subject (0.3%) in the Indication Safety Set had 
a Grade 5 event (autoimmune hepatitis); in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, the incidence of 
Grade 5 events was similar (0.4%). 
Incidences of hepatotoxicity in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set were 3.1% vs. 1.7% for SAEs, 1.1% vs. 0.8% for discontinuations, 8.5% vs 3.1% for dose 
interruptions and 4.3% vs. 2.1% for dose reductions. 
QT Prolongation 
The overall incidence of QT prolongation events is similar in the Indication and Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Sets (6.5% and 4.8%).  Grade 3 events were reported at a higher incidence in the Indication 
Safety Set (2.8%) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (1.1%). In the Indication Safety Set, 8 
subjects (2.8%) had cardiac-related TEAEs that were associated with QT prolongation events:  4 subjects 
had Grade 2 QT prolongation events associated with TEAEs of mild arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia or 
supra ventricular extrasystole) or mild LV dysfunction, and 4 subjects each had one Grade 3 QT 
prolongation event associated with atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, or acute cardiac 
failure. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation, interruption, and reduction of lenvatinib were 
reported at a similar incidence in the Indication Safety Set (0.3%, 0%, and 0.6%, respectively) and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (0.1%, 0.9%, and 0.3%, respectively. 
Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events was higher in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm 
compared with the sunitinib arm (5.4 and 2.1%, respectively).

The incidence of the CSE arterial thromboembolic events was similar between the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm (5.4%) and the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (5.7%); however, a clinically 
meaningful difference was noted in the incidence for the PTs of acute myocardial infarction and 
myocardial infarction (all AEs of myocardial infarction were Grade 3 or 4 in the Indication Safety Set). 
Table 48 TEAEs by SOC and PT  
Cardiac Dysfunction 
The incidence of the CSE of cardiac dysfunction events was similar in the Indication Safety Set (2.6%), 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (5.5%) and in the sunitinib arm (2.1%).

Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction events were congestive cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 
decreased, left ventricular dysfunction and stress cardiomyopathy reported in 1 subject each and cardiac 
failure reported in 2 subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm; A review of the 6 subjects with 
Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction events in the Indication Safety Set indicated that the majority of the subjects 
had pre-existing risk factors: the subject with stress cardiomyopathy had multiple pericardial tumour 
lesions along with a reduced ejection fraction (30%) reported on Day 3; the subject with left ventricular 
dysfunction had this condition at Baseline; the subject with congestive cardiac failure had baseline aortic 
valve incompetence, stenosis, and replacement with left bundle branch block; the subject with acute 
cardiac failure had a pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation and had an associated TEAE of QT 
prolongation.  One subject with cardiac failure had concurrent Grade 3 myocarditis. 
AEOSI for pembrolizumab  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) are categories comprised of groups of PTs developed by the 
Sponsor during the pembrolizumab monotherapy program to assess the frequency of immune-mediated 
events considered by the Sponsor to be causally related to pembrolizumab. 
The overall incidence of AEOSI was higher in the Indication Safety Set (60.8%) than in the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (21.4% and 25.1%, respectively). The 
majority of AEOSI events were Grade 1 and 2; however higher incidences of AEOSI in the Indication 
Safety Set were also observed for Grade ≥3 (14.8% vs 6.5%), serious AEOSI (12.5% vs 6.5%) and 
AEOSI leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab (10.2% vs 3.9% for the Indication Safety Set vs the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B Safety Set, respectively; see Table 51).  In the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm, the incidence of Grade ≥3 AEOSI was 14.8%, consisting primarily of Grade 3 events 
(12.8%). Five subjects (1.4%) had Grade 4 AEOSI; these were immune-hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, 
pneumonitis, severe skin reactions (PT toxic epidermal necrolysis), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (PT 
diabetic ketoacidosis). Two subjects (0.4%) had Grade 5 AEOSI: myocarditis, nephritis, pneumonitis, and 
hepatitis in 1 subject, and myasthenic syndrome in the other subject.  
The higher incidence of all-grade AEOSI in the Indication Safety Set was primarily driven by 
hypothyroidism (47.2%, 8.5%, and 11.1%, respectively).  Further AEOSI with an increased incidence in 
the Indication Safety Set compared to the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets 
were hyperthyroidism (8.0%, 3.4%, and 4.2%, respectively), adrenal insufficiency (5.1%, 0.8%, and 
0.8%), severe skin reactions (5.1%, 1.4%, and 1.6%), and pancreatitis (2.8%, 0.3%, and 0.3%). [- 
Numerically higher incidences in the Indication Safety set were also reported for AEOSIs of colitis (2.6%, 
1.7%, 1.1%), hepatitis (2.0%, 0.7%, 0.5%), myocarditis (1.1% vs. 0%, 0%), and nephritis (1.7%, 
0.3%, 0.4%). Pneumonitis was reported for 5.4%, 3.4%, and 4.5% of subjects, incidences of Grade ≥3 
pneumonitis events were 2.0%, 1.3% and 1.5%.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant safety set. 
Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported in the same special interest category or PT were counted only once in the worst CTCAE grade. 
Adverse event terms were coded using MedDRA version 23.0. 
Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 4.03.

Data cutoff date:  28 Aug 2020 for Study 307; for all other studies, the clinical cutoff dates specified in ISS SAP version 2.0 were used. 
1L = first line, AEOSI = adverse event of special interest, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Lenv = 
lenvatinib, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, Monotx = monotherapy, Pembro = pembrolizumab, PT = preferred 
term, Q3W = once every 3 weeks, QD = once daily, RCC = renal cell carcinoma, RSD = Reference Safety Dataset, TEAE = treatment 
emergent adverse event. 
Hypothyroidism 
TEAEs of hypothyroidism were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the Indication Safety Set 
(47.2%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A or RSD-B) Safety Sets (8.5%, and 11.1%, 
respectively).  In the Indication Safety Set, most of the events of hypothyroidism (97.0%) were Grade 1 
or 2.  The remaining 5 events were all Grade 3.  The incidence of drug discontinuation due to 
hypothyroidism was low in both the Indication Safety Set and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A 
and RSD-B) Safety Sets (0.6%, <0.1%, and <0.1%, respectively).   
Hyperthyroidism 
TEAEs of hyperthyroidism were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the Indication Safety Set 
(8.0%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A or RSD-B) Safety Sets (3.4%, and 4.2%, 
respectively); the same was also observed for treatment-related TEAEs (6.3%, 2.9%, and 3.7%, 
respectively).  All hyperthyroidism events in the Indication Safety Set were Grade 1 and 2 with no Grade 
≥3 events.  In the Indication Safety Set, hyperthyroidism did not lead to drug discontinuation and led to 
pembrolizumab interruption in only 2 subjects (0.6%). 
Adrenal Insufficiency 
TEAEs of adrenal insufficiency were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the Indication Safety 
Set (5.1.%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets (0.8%). Adrenal insufficiency events in 
the Indication Safety Set were mostly Grade 1 or 2 (14 of 18 subjects).  The remaining 4 events were all 
Grade 3 (1.1% in the Indication Safety Set and 0.3% in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets).  
Of the 18 subjects, 14 had prior nephrectomy/adrenalectomy and another subject had preexisting 
pituitary adenoma with secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.  Adrenal insufficiency was managed with 
drug discontinuation of pembrolizumab (1 subject [0.3%]) and drug interruption (5 subjects [1.4%]), 
systemic corticosteroids as appropriate, and standard medical care as per the protocol. 
Severe Skin Reactions 
Severe skin reaction AEOSI in the Indication Safety Set were mostly Grade 3 (4.8%) with 1 Grade 4 
(0.3%) event, and were reported at a higher incidence than that in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy 
(RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (Grade 3:  1.1% and 1.3%, respectively; Grade 4:  0% and 0%).  The 
incidence of severe skin reaction events leading to drug discontinuation was low in both the Indication 
Safety Set and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (1.4%, 0.1%, and 
0.2%).  The event led to drug interruption in 6 subjects (1.7%) in the Indication Safety Set.   
Pancreatitis 
The overall pancreatitis incidence in the Indication Safety Set was higher than that in the Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (2.8%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively).  In the Indication 
Safety Set, the events were Grade 2 in 4 subjects, Grade 3 in 5 subjects, and Grade 4 in 1 subject 
(1.1%, 1.4%, and 0.3%, respectively); respective incidences for Grade 2, 3 and 4 events in the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A Safety Set were lower (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.0%). The incidence of 
pancreatitis leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab was 0.9% in the Indication Safety Set and 0.1% 
in both Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets.  Drug interruption due to the events occurred in 5 
subjects (1.4%) in the Indication Safety Set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 121/144 
 
 
 
 
 
In the Indication Safety Set, SAEs of pancreatitis (including acute pancreatitis and immune-mediated 
pancreatitis) were reported for 7 (2.0%) subjects.  The majority of subjects reporting pancreatitis SAEs 
had pre-existing hyperlipidemia and elevated triglycerides as well as obesity (BMI over 30). 
Of note, pancreatitis is also a known ADR for lenvatinib.   
Myocarditis 
The incidence of myocarditis was 1.1% in the Indication Safety Set with 4 events:  1 Grade 1 (0.3%), 2 
Grade 3 (0.6%), and 1 Grade 5 (0.3%).  The incidence of Grade ≥3 myocarditis was lower for  
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (0.1% in RSD-B). 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology  
Overall, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory results in the Indication Safety Set was 
low (≤5%), similar to that in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and higher in the sunitinib arm. 
Grade 3 events of INR increased were reported in 3% of subjects (compared to 0.8% in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set and 1.3% in the sunitinib arm).

a:  ‘m’ indicates the number of subjects with both nonmissing baseline and at least 1 postbaseline result in the 
relevant safety set; this number is used to calculate the percentages within each laboratory test.

Urinalysis 
In the Indication Safety Set, a total of 19.0% (65/343) of subjects had a shift in urine dipstick protein 
from negative or trace at Baseline to 3+ during treatment. A shift in score from negative or trace at 
Baseline to 4+ during treatment occurred for an additional 5.2% (18/343) of subjects. A similar shift 
pattern was observed in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS with 13.2% (139/1049) of subjects having a shift 
from negative or trace at Baseline to 3+ during treatment and 5.2% (55/1049) of subjects having 
negative or trace at Baseline to 4+ during treatment. 
The AE data were consistent with the laboratory data, although more subjects in all safety sets reported 
proteinuria as a TEAE than had shifts in urine dipstick protein from a score of negative or trace at 
Baseline to 3+ or 4+ during treatment. In the Integrated Safety Set, the majority of proteinuria TEAEs 
(29.5%) were effectively managed with dose interruptions (7.7%) or reductions (10.2%); few subjects 
(1.7%) had proteinuria events leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib treatment. 
2.5.1.1.  Vital Signs 
In the Indication Safety Set, a shift from Grade 0 or from Grade 1 hypertension at Baseline to a worst 
postbaseline of Grade 3 during treatment was observed for 6.3% of subjects for Grade 0 and 24.1% of 
subjects for Grade 1. These findings were similar to those in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS (8.4% and 
21.8%, respectively) No such data are available for the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy SSs. 
In the Indication Safety Set, the incidence of hypertension reported as a TEAE was 55.4% and that of 
hypotension was 6.8%. These results are similar to those in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS (60.1% for 
hypertension and 7.8% for hypotension); however, the incidences are higher than those observed in the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A (3.8% for hypertension and 2.4% for hypotension) and RSD-B 
(5.0% for hypertension and 2.8% for hypotension) Safety Sets.  
In the Indication Safety Set, 1 subject (0.3%) had a TEAE of hypertension that led to the discontinuation 
of lenvatinib; this was similar to the incidence of hypertension leading to discontinuation in the lenvatinib 
Monotherapy SS (15 subjects [1.3%]). 
2.5.1.2.  ECG 
In the Indication Safety Set, shifts in ECG findings from normal at Baseline to abnormal, clinically 
significant postbaseline were observed in 7.0% of subjects and shifts from abnormal, not clinically 
significant to abnormal, clinically significant were observed in 5.8% of subjects. Corresponding shifts were 
similar for the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS (5.6% and 4.5%, respectively). 
2.5.1.3.  QTc 
In the Indication Safety Set, there were no clinically relevant differences in shifts in Karnofsky 
Performance Status scores from Baseline to worst postbaseline KPS score. 
Echocardiogram data were consistent in the Indication and lenvatinib Monotherapy SSs. In the Indication 
Safety Set, most subjects had a normal LVEF value at Baseline, with no postbaseline shift (89.2% 
[74/83]). Only 3 subjects (3.6%) had a worsening shift in LVEF from normal at Baseline to mild 
dysfunction, 2 subjects (2.4%) to moderate dysfunction, and 3 subjects (3.6%) to severe dysfunction 
postbaseline. 
In the Indication Safety Set, the median change (decrease) from Baseline in LVEF was -2.0% (range: -
32% to 13%), similar to results in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS (-5.0% [range: -54% to 19%]). 
Likewise, the percentage of subjects with a worst postbaseline LVEF less than 50% was similar in the 
Indication (10.6%) and Lenvatinib Monotherapy (11.3%) Safety Sets. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021

The TEAEs of “ejection fraction decreased” were reported for 1 subject (0.3%) in the Indication Safety 
Set, 37 subjects (3.3%) in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS and 6 subjects (2.8%) in the Non-RCC Safety 
Set, indicating that there likely is no increased risk of decreased LVEF with combination therapy. 
Safety in special populations 
2.5.1.4.  Pregnancy & Lactation 
No pregnancies have been reported with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in the treatment of RCC as of the 
data cutoff date (28 Aug 2020) for Study 307. However. Based on their MoA it is generally accepted that 
both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab will have fetotoxic properties that will likely lead to in-utero harm. 
Lenvatinib was embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits, and while animal 
reproduction studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab, blockade of programmed death-
ligand 1 (PD-L1) signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the 
fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss. 
This data and consequences for treatment are clearly noted in both Kisplyx and Keytruda product’s 
SmPCs. 
2.5.1.5.  Subgroup analysis: Age 
Safety and exposure were evaluated for the age subgroups <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years, with the 
majority of Indication SSsubjects being <65 years of age (54.8%) and the ≥75 years of age subgroup 
being relatively small which implies caution should be needed when interpreting results in this advanced 
age group. 
Median treatment duration, dose intensity and percentage received dose based on the planned starting 
dose also decreased with increasing age, an observation that was also shared in the lenvatinib 
Monotherapy SS. An overview of TEAE occurrence in the age subgroups for all SSs is shown in Table 55.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant safety set. MedDRA preferred terms ‘Neoplasm Progression,’ 
‘Malignant Neoplasm Progression,’ and ‘Disease Progression,’ which are unrelated. For each row category, subjects with 2 or more AEs 
in that category were counted only once. A subject may be counted in multiple categories. For nonserious AEs, TEAEs used the window 
of 30 days within the last dose of study drug. Data cutoff date: 28 Aug 2020 for Study 307; for all other studies, the clinical cutoff dates 
specified in ISS SAP version 2.0 were used. Indication Safety Set: Subjects from Study 307 with 1L RCC who received Lenv 20 mg QD 
+ Pembro 200 mg Q3W. Sunitinib Safety Set: Subjects from Study 307 with 1L RCC who received Sunitinib 50 mg QD. All RCC Safety 
Set: Subjects from Study 307 and Study 111 with RCC who received at least 1 dose of Lenv 20 mg QD + Pembro 200 mg as starting 
dose, regardless of prior anticancer therapy. Non-RCC Safety Set: Subjects from non-RCC cohorts (non-small-cell lung cancer, 
endometrial carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and melanoma) from Studies 111 and 115 
who were treated with Lenv 20 mg QD + Pembro 200 mg Q3W as starting dose. Lenv Monotx Safety Set: Subjects with a starting dose 
level of Lenv 24 mg QD monotherapy from 11 studies. Pembro Monotx RSD-A Safety Set: Subjects treated with Pembro from clinical 
studies (KN-001, KN-002, KN-006, and KN-010). Pembro Monotx RSD-B Safety Set: Subjects treated with Pembro from clinical studies 
(RSD-A plus KN-012, KN-013, KN-024, KN-040, KN-042, KN-045, KN-048, KN- 052, KN-054, KN-055, KN-087) in EU-approved 
indications as of 11 Sep 2020. 1L = first line, AE = adverse event, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Lenv = lenvatinib, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, 
Monotx = monotherapy, NA = not applicable, Pembro = pembrolizumab, Q3W = once every 3 weeks, QD = once daily, RCC = renal cell 
carcinoma, RSD = Reference Safety Dataset, SAE = serious adverse event, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. a:  Adverse 
events were graded using CTCAE version 4.03. 
b:  Treatment-related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be related, or possibly/probably related to the 
study drug or TEAEs with a missing causality on the case report form.  A total of 19 events (12 subjects) in the Pembro Monotx RSD-A 
and 31 events (21 subjects) in the Pembro Monotx RSD-B with missing causality were considered ‘related’ to study drug. 
c:  For combination of Lenv 20 mg + Pembro, the SAE follow-up window was 90 days after the last dose for Studies 111 and 115, and 
120 days after the last dose date for Study 307.  For Lenv Monotx and Pembro Monotx (RSD-A and RSD-B), the window was 30 days 
and 90 days after the last dose, respectively. 
d:  Lenv or Pembro (or sunitinib). 
e:  Regardless of the action taken for Pembro. 
f:  Regardless of the action taken for Lenv. 
g:  Due to the same AE. 
h:  Dose modification includes dose reduction or drug interruption.

As can be seen in Table 55 the incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was higher in the older age subgroups than 
in the <65 years age subgroup in the Indication Safety Set and in both the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS as 
well as in the pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B SS.  
The incidence of deaths was also higher in the older subgroups for both the Indication and 
pembrolizumab Monotherapy SSs, but not for the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS. 
Consistent with the duration of treatment, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study 
drug was higher in 1 or both of the older aged subgroups than in the <65 years age subgroup for the 
Indication SSS and lenvatinib Monotherapy SS but not for the pembrolizumab Monotherapy SSs, though a 
trend in this direction seems to be visible there too. Discontinuations of each investigated therapy taken 
alone were similar to that observed with discontinuations overall. 
The incidence of dose reductions and interruptions for lenvatinib was higher in 1 or both of the older aged 
subgroups than in the <65 years age subgroup for the Indication Safety Set and the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set.  Note that pembrolizumab was not dose reduced as per the study protocols  
Lastly, the incidence of dose modifications was more common in the 2 older age subgroups than in the 
<65 years age subgroup in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  
Overall lenvatinib CSEs were reported in similar incidence in the various age subgroups in the associated 
safety sets with the exception of proteinuria and renal events, both of which occurred more frequently in 
the older subgroups. This latter observation was seen in both the Indication as well as the lenvatinib 
Monotherapy SSs. 
Subgroup analysis: Sex 
In the Indication Safety Set, the majority of the subjects were male (71.6%), whereas these percentages 
were 49.51%, 59.27% and 66.06% in the lenvatinib, pembrolizumab RSD-A and pembrolizumab RSD-B 
subgroups. Given the rather large intergroup inbalance in male:female ratios, any interpretations of this 
subanalysis should be done with caution. 
Overall, the most obvious difference noted was that the incidence of Grade ≥3 related TEAEs being  
higher in the female subgroup than in the male subgroup in the lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set while 
being  similar between sexes in the Indication SS and pembrolizumab Monotherapy SSs.  
In the Indication Safety Set, the incidence of diarrhea was higher in male subjects (66.7%) than female 
subjects (48.0%), which was not observed in the monotherapy safety sets or the Non-RCC Safety Set.  
Regarding lenvatinib CSEs, for the overall population these were all reported at a similar incidence within 
each sex subgroup for both Indication and lenvatinib Monotherapy SSs.  
Subgroup analysis: Race 
Overall the incidence of TEAEs, related TEAEs, and Grade ≥3 TEAEs were similar between the race 
subgroups in the Indication SS, which itself was consistent with that in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS . 
The incidence of SAEs and non-fatal SAEs was similar between the race subgroups in the Indication 
Safety Set and the monotherapy safety sets. Of note is the fact that the incidence of fatal SAEs was lower 
in the Asian Race subgroup than in the White Race subgroup in the Indication Safety Set, as well as the 
All RCC and Non-RCC Safety Sets, but not in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  No major 
differences in TEAE incidences were evident in the Indication SS between White and Asian subsets, a part 
for: 
−  PPES (17.3% and 64.2% respectively) and proteinuria (and 22.7% and 55.6%), which were also 
seen in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS .  
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 127/144 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
fatigue (46.5% and 23.5%, respectively), nausea (41.9% and 14.8%), arthralgia (31.9% and 
14.8%), vomiting (27.3% and 18.5%), asthenia (25.8% and 3.7%), cough (23.8% and 6.2%), 
and dyspnea (18.8% and 1.2%); all of which, save for asthenia, were not seen in the lenvatinib 
Monotherapy SS . 
Lenvatinib CSEs did not show any disparity between Asian and White subsets, a part for hypothyroidism 
which was reported with a 14,9% higher incidence by the former subset. This latter difference was 
however not replicated in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS. 
Subgroup analysis: Baseline Renal Function 
Two creatine clearance subgroups were defined for this analysis: CrCl ≥60 mL/min and CrCl <60 mL/min, 
the former of which encompassed 65.1% of the Indication SSsubjects. 
In the Indication Safety Set, the median duration of treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 
higher in the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup than in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup, the former of which was 
about 69% longer compared to the latter. This was in contrast to the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS where 
both subgroups’ median treatment duration was broadly similar. It should be noted that in the Indication 
SS the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup median dose intensity and received dose as a percentage of planned 
starting dose were 18.6% and 11.43% higher, respectively, than in the lower CrCl group. 
The incidences of TEAEs and related TEAEs were similar between the renal function subgroups in the 
Indication SS, which was consistent with the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS . The incidences of Grade ≥3 
TEAEs and Grade ≥3 related TEAEs were however higher in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup for the 
Indication Safety Set whereas they were similar between the renal function subgroups in the lenvatinib 
Monotherapy SS as well as the Non-RCC Safety Set. 
The incidences of fatal SAEs and nonfatal SAEs were higher in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup than in the 
CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup for the Indication Safety Set but were again similar between the renal 
function subgroups in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS as well as in the Non-RCC SS. The subjects in the 
Indication Safety Set in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup had a higher incidence of discontinuation of 
lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, and both drugs than in the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup.  
Finally, in the Indication SS, events in the most common lenvatinib CSE groups were reported at a similar 
incidence in each of the renal function subgroup, which was also true of the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS, 
save for renal events which were reported at a 13.6% higher frequency in the CrCl <60 mL/min 
subgroup. 
Subgroup analysis: Baseline Hepatic Function 
Due to the imbalance in hepatic function subgroups (330 subjects with Normal (no CTCAE Grade 1 AST, 
ALT, and bilirubin) function vs 22 subjects with abnormal funtion), comparisons regarding TEAEs in the 
Indication SS are considered not meaningful. 
Subgroup analysis: Baseline Hypertension 
In the Indication SS 57.4% of subjects had hypertension, and the overall TEAEs, related TEAEs, non-fatal 
SAEs and fatal SAEs was similar between the hypertension and no hypertension subgroups. The incidence 
of Grade ≥3 TEAEs and Grade ≥3 related TEAEs were slightly higher in the former group and this was 
also noted in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS. 
In contrast, the subjects with hypertension at Baseline in the Indication Safety Set had a higher incidence 
of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib than did the subjects without Baseline hypertension. This 
difference was not observed in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS.

Outcomes in the all-RCC ss were wholly consistent with the findings in the Indication SS.Subgroup 
analysis: Geographic Region 
Safety and exposure were evaluated for the geographic regions Western Europe and North America verus 
Rest of World, and in the Indication SS the median duration of treatment with lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab was similar for both geographic regions (6% difference only). 
Overall, there was no major difference between TEAE incidence between subgroups and this was 
consistent across all SSs. TEAEs leading to lenvatinib discontinuation occurred less in the WE/NA group 
compared to the ROW group, though strangely this finding was opposite in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS  
On the other hand, incidences of TEAEs leading to lenvatinib dose reduction were similar between the 
Indication SSsubgroups, whereas these incidences were lower in the WE/NA subgroups of the lenvatninb 
Monotherapy SS. 
Overall study drug interruption due to TEAEs was also higher in the WE/NA subgroups of the lenvatninb 
Monotherapy SS, whereas they were similar to the ROW subgroups in all the other SSs. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Since Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is primarily catabolized like other proteins, while 
lenvatinib is metabolized by enzymatic (cytochrome P450 3A and aldehyde oxidase) and nonenzymatic 
processes, no pharmacokinetic drug interaction is expected between both. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total 13.4% of subjects had TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation of both lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab, which was similar to that in the All RCC Safety Set (12.9%) and lower than that in the 
Non-RCC Safety Set (23.7%). It was also similar to the rate of such events in the sunitinib SS (14.4%). 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug in more than 1 subject were as follows:  
−  Acute kidney injury (2 subjects; 1 Grade 4 and 1 Grade 3 TEAE, both related to study drug) 
−  Pneumonitis (2 subjects; 1 Grade 4 and 1 Grade 3 TEAE, both related to study drug) 
−  Proteinuria (2 subjects; 1 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 2 TEAE, both related to study drug) 
−  Rash (2 subjects; both Grade 3 and related to study drug) 
The Incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation of lenvatinib, regardless of the action taken 
with pembrolizumab, was similar in the Indication Safety Set (25.6%) and in the lenvatinib Monotherapy 
SS (26.7%). The incidences of each of these events in the Indication Safety Set were all less than 2%. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs leading to treatment discontinuation of pembrolizumab, 
regardless of the action taken with lenvatinib, in the Indication Safety Set (28.7%) was higher than that 
in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets (RSD-A: 11.9%; RSD-B: 13.4%). The most frequently 
reported event in the Indication Safety Set was pneumonitis (2.8%). The incidences of other events 
leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab were all less than 2%.  
Dose alterations due to AEs 
In the Indication Safety Set, 84.7% of subjects had TEAEs leading to a lenvatinib dose modification (dose 
interruption or reduction), 73.0% had TEAEs leading to a dose interruption, and 68.8% had TEAEs leading 
to a dose reduction. This was in contrast to the sunitinib SS where these latter two numbers were 53.8% 
and 50.3% respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 129/144 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to such dose reduction of lenvatinib was higher in the Indication Safety 
Set (68.8%) than in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS (47.5%) and a similar trend was observed for 
treatment-related TEAEs leading to lenvatinib interruption or reduction.  
TEAEs that most frequently leading to a lenvatinib dose reduction (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) were 
diarrhea (15.9%), hypertension (11.6%), proteinuria (10.2%), PPES (8.8%), decreased appetite (7.7%), 
and nausea (5.1%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to a dose interruption of lenvatinib was similar in the Indication (73.0%) 
and Lenvatinib Monotherapy (67.6%) Safety Sets and again a similar trend was observed for treatment 
related TEAEs leading to lenvatinib dose reduction.  
The TEAEs that most frequently led to a lenvatinib dose interruption (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) were 
diarrhea (17.6%), hypertension (8.2%), proteinuria (7.7%), asthenia (6.3%), increased lipase (5.4%), 
and fatigue (5.1%).  
Regarding pembrolizumab, the overall incidence of TEAEs leading to a dose interruption in the Indication 
Safety Set (55.1%) was higher than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets (22.2% for RSD-A 
and 25.4% for RSD-B). 
The TEAEs that most frequently led to a pembrolizumab dose interruption (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
in the Indication Safety Set were diarrhea (10.2%) and increased lipase (5.1%). 
Overall Conclusions on discontinuations and dose modifications 
TEAE-caused treatment discontinuation rates for lenvatinib were similar in both Indication (25.6%) and 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy (26.7%) Safety Sets. Moreover, they were substantially lower than the rates for 
dose reductions (68.8% and 47.5% in the Indication and lenvatinib Monotherapy SSs, respectively) and 
interruptions (73.0% and 67.6). 
Hence, these findings indicate that the majority of TEAEs can be managed with lenvatinib dose 
modifications rather than with lenvatinib discontinuation according to the prespecified dose modification 
Post marketing experience 
Both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab have a safety profile which is well-known and summarized in the 
respective Periodic Safety Update Reports and product information.  
No revocation or withdrawal of lenvatinib or pembrolizumab or registration for safety reasons has 
occurred in any country. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In support of the safety of the novel combination therapy consisting of oral QD lenvatinib and IV Q3W 
pembrolizumab in the context of 1L advanced RCC, the Applicant submitted the results of the E7080-
G000-307/KEYNOTE 581 CLEAR trial, wherein the aforementioned combination is compared to the, 
treatment of oral sunitinib in a 4/2 schedule.  
Note that the E7080-G000-307/KEYNOTE 581 CLEAR trial also included a lenvatinib + everolimus 
investigative arm, but in light of the investigative subject of this particular procedure this arm was 
considered of negligible interest and as such any results thereof are not discussed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 130/144 
 
 
 
 
 
As of data cut-off date 352 subjects were enrolled to receive a starting dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab 
every 3 weeks and 20 mg lenvatinib once daily (QD) (Indication Safety Set) and 340 subjects were 
enrolled in Arm B to receive sunitinib 50 mg QD (Sunitinib Safety Set). 
In addition to the comparison with the preferred treatment regimen the Applicant also discussed the 
safety findings in contrast to the aggregated safety results from lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy studies in a variety of indications. Additionally, supportive safety data was also available 
from other studies using the investigative combination in RCC and non-RCC indications. 
When adjust for exposure time the median duration of exposure of the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
combination was about 2.2 times longer than sunitininband the safety profiles between sunitinib and the 
investigative combination became more similar than initially observed, though  observed difference in 
safety outcomes still remains. 
The most common TEAEs, occurring in over 30% of subjects, were generally similar between both 
treatment arms a part for hypothyroidism which was only common in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab 
arm and PPE syndrome which was only common in the sunitinib arm. When comparing to the aggregated 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab monotherapy data TEAE outcomes and incidences were generally 
consistent, and for those known safety effects that had an imbalance to the detriment of the combination 
treatment (diarrhea (54.5%, 45.4%, and 10.7%); hypothyroidism (42.6%, 11.1%, and 9.6%); increased 
amylase (15.1%, 0.9%, and 0.2%); increased lipase (14.2%, 2.8%, and 0.3%)) any excess incidence 
was mostly due to low grade (≤2) events. 
Overall severe events (Grade ≥3) occurred with a +/- 10% higher incidence in the investigative 
combination treatment in absolute terms, which was also reflected in individual event incidences, but 
when adjusted for exposure the rates were  similar in both treatment arms (1.95 versus 2.06 per SY 
overall), save for SAEs (0.72 vs 0.55 per SY, respectively). 
Non-fatal STEAEs had, in absolute terms, a higher incidence in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
arm(50%) then in the sunitinib (32.6%), and this difference remained pronounced after adjustment for 
exposure (0.68 versus 0.51 per SY). On the other hand, fatal TEAEs were reported in similar absolute 
overall incidence rates between both lenvatinib and sunitinib arms, 7.7% versus 6.8%, as well as in 
exposure-adjusted rates (0.04/SY versus 0.03/SY). When compared to the aggregated monotherapy data 
of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab fatal TEAEs were respectively similar and less numerous in the 
combination treatment safety set, both in absolute and exposure adjusted terms, and no clustering of 
fatalities was apparent. 
Despite the seemingly worse SAE profile in the combination treatment there were nonetheless not more 
treatment discontinuations noted (13.4% versus 14.4%) and importantly there were no TEAEs identified 
that led to cluster discontinuations (= more than 2 subjects). Moreover, this observation also held when 
comparing discontinuation rates with the aggregated lenvatinib and pembrolizumab monotherapy data. 
Dose reductions or interruptions occurred more frequently in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm, but 
given that there was no significant difference in discontinuation rates versus the monotherapy comparator 
data this indicates that dose management of the combination treatment is sufficient to allow patients to 
continue treatment in case of (S)TEAEs. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSIs) for pembrolizumab occurred in twice as many subjects in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared to the sunitinib arm, and similarly a small increase of these 
events compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy data was also seen. Nonetheless, AEOSIs were overall 
low Grade (≤2), consistent with the known safety profile for pembrolizumab and no new immune events 
were noted. One notable exception to the known safety profile was the heightened incidence of low-grade 
hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a known adverse drug reaction for both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
and the unexpected higher incidence could be due to the combination of that two risk profiles.  
Assessment report  
EMA/621560/2021 
Page 131/144 
 
 
 
 
Overall the observed CSEs for lenvatinib differ in overall incidence compared to the sunitinib arm by 94% 
versus 85% and the observed lenvatinib CSE profile was congruent with the known safety profile of the 
drug.  
When comparing CSEs with the lenvatinib monotherapy set most were similar a part for hypothyroidism, 
renal events, and hepatotoxicity that were higher, although the difference was mostly due to low grade 
(≤2) events. The higher incidence of renal events was an expected observation in this patient population 
due to the underlying disease versus the indication-independent aggregated monotherapy set. As for 
hepatotoxicity events, no clustering or patterning was apparent. 
Overall, the combination profile as observed in the CLEAR study 307 matched the profile seen in other 
RCC studies and non-RCC indications. No new safety signals were observed compared to lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab monotherapy safety profiles, although worsening of the overlapping toxicity (e.g. 
hypothyroidism). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to lenvatinib dose reduction of was higher in the Indication Safety Set 
(68.8%) than in the lenvatinib Monotherapy SS (47.5%) and a similar trend was observed for treatment-
related TEAEs leading to lenvatinib interruption or reduction. The most frequently TEAEs leading to a 
lenvatinib dose reduction (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) were diarrhoea (15.9%), hypertension (11.6%), 
proteinuria (10.2%), PPES (8.8%), decreased appetite (7.7%), and nausea (5.1%). The incidence of 
TEAEs leading to a dose interruption of lenvatinib was similar in the combination (73.0%) and Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy (67.6%) Safety Sets and again a similar trend was observed for treatment-related TEAEs 
leading to lenvatinib dose reduction. The TEAEs that most frequently led to a lenvatinib dose interruption 
(occurring in ≥5% of subjects) were diarrhoea (17.6%), hypertension (8.2%), proteinuria (7.7%), 
asthenia (6.3%), increased lipase (5.4%), and fatigue (5.1%).  
In the combination arm dose reductions were observed in 70.7% vs 53.2% in the sunitinib arm in Study 
307. Dose interruptions were observed in 67.9% in the combination vs 53.2% in the sunitinib arm in 
Study 307. TEAE leading to lenvatinib dose modifications occurred in 84.7% of the patients. The median 
average daily lenvatinib dose was 14 mg, while the planned starting dose was 20 mg QD. 
Finally, subgroup analysis indicated that increasing age may be related to worse tolerability of the 
combination treatment as higher incidences in the older age subgroups than in the <65 years age 
subgroup were reported for Grade ≥3 TEAEs, SAEs, fatal SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuations. 
Though there was a lack of data in patients ≥ 75 years of age, noticeable differences were present for the 
lenvatinib CSEs of proteinuria and renal events within the different age strata. 
.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with renal cancer is 
overall unfavourable compared with sunitinib; however, the pattern of observed AEs is generally 
consistent with what would be expected from the addition of the two individual drugs with different, but 
partly also overlapping toxicity profiles. No new safety signals were identified. 
The tolerability of the combined regimen appears worse with increasing age.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Worldwide, kidney cancer is the 14th most common cancer, and is the 9th most frequently diagnosed 
cancer in men and 14th in women (World Cancer Research Fund, 2020).  Renal cell carcinoma is the most 
common type of kidney cancer, constituting the majority of primary renal neoplasms.  Most cases of RCC 
(70%–80%) are classified as clear-cell tumours. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, the following agents targeting the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway are approved for the 1L 
treatment of advanced RCC: sunitinib, pazopanib, bevacizumab + IFNα, tivozanib and cabozantinib (in 
patients who are considered to be intermediate and poor risk). 
In addition to agents that target VEGFR and VEGF, other approved agents for advanced RCC include the 
mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for patients considered to be poor risk (per the MSKCC risk category) in the 
1L setting and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus 
Recently, the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab was approved in the EU for use in treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced RCC who were considered to be intermediate or poor risk per the IMDC criteria. In 
addition, the combination of avelumab plus axitinib, axitinib plus pembrolizumab, and cabozantinib plus 
nivolumab has been approved by EMA for the 1L treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC. 
In spite of recent additions to the (systemic) treatment armamentarium, both (median) progression-free 
survival (PFS) and OS for patients with advanced RCC are still rather limited, especially for patients in the 
intermediate and poor risk groups. There thus remains an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study 307 (CLEAR)/KEYNOTE-581 is an multicentre, randomized, open-label, 3 arm Phase 3 
study. A total of 1069 subjects were randomized 1:1:1, of whom 355 were allocated to receive lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab, 357 subjects were allocated to receive lenvatinib plus everolimus, and 357 subjects 
were allocated to receive sunitinib, in the 1L setting. Arm A of the study (lenvatinib and everolimus) is 
not part of the current submission. The ITT population includes 355 subjects in lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab (arm B) and 357 subjects in the sunitinib arm (arm C). Three subjects (0.8%) in arm B 
ad 17 (4.8%) subjects in arm C were not treated.  
The primary objectives of the study were to compare the PFS per RECIST 1.1 by Independent Imaging 
Review (IIR) in participants treated with pembrolizumab + lenvatinib vs sunitinib. OS, ORR, safety and 
tolerability profile of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib, PFS2 and PFS by investigator assessment, PROs, and 
PK assessments were secondary objectives. 
The application is based upon the interim analysis 3 (final analysis for PFS, interim analysis for OS). 
Updated result for OS has been provided during the procedure.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant benefit in PFS (IRR) has been observed for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab over 
sunitinib with HR=0.39 (95% CI:  0.32, 0.49, P<0.0001). 
A statistically significant benefit in OS has been observed for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab over sunitinib 
with HR of 0.66 (95% CI:  0.49, 0.88, P=0.0049) at 22,5% of maturity in lenvatinib-pembrolimab arm 
and 28,3% of maturity in sunitinib arm. 
Confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by IIR in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm was higher 
the ORR in the sunitinib arm (71.0% and 36.1%, respectively). The odds ratio (OR) was 4.35 (95% CI:  
3.16, 5.97; nominal P<0.0001) in favor of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.  The median time to response 
was similar in both arms. The median DOR in responders was 25.8 months (95% CI:  22.1, 27.9) in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 14.6 months (95% CI:  9.4, 16.7) in the sunitinib arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS data are currently immature to allow for the informative analyses in the key subgroups, in 
particular IMDC and MSKCC favourable prognosis subgroups, while the updated analysis in the overall 
population supports benefit, with HR of 0.72 (0.55, 0.93). 
The lack of monotherapy experimental arms in study 307 hinders the assessment of the contribution of 
each component in the combination treatment. The indirect comparisons have provided for monotherapy 
data (in 2L for lenvatinib monotherapy) and the combination use is supported by mechanistic rationale.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the study 307, nearly all patients in both the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab and the sunitinib arms had 
at least one TEAE.  
An unfavourable toxicity profile was observed for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared to sunitinib, 
based on between-treatment arm differences in terms of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% vs 71.8%), non-fatal 
SAEs (50.0% vs 32.6%), and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab 
(37.2% vs 14.4%). TEAE leading to lenvatinib dose modifications occurred in 84.7% of the patients; dose 
modifications occurred early in the treatment. The median average daily lenvatinib dose was 14 mg, while 
the planned starting dose was 20 mg QD. 
The most common TEAEs (≥ 40%) in the Indication Safety Set were diarrhoea (61.4%), hypertension 
(55.4%), hypothyroidism (47.2%), decreased appetite (40.3%), and fatigue (40.1%).  
The incidences of most TEAEs categories were similar between the Indication Safety Set and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set; however numerically higher incidences of related Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
occurred in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (71.6% and 
64.7%), mainly driven by Grade 4 events (11.6% and 4.7%). Clinically significant events (CSEs) of 
hypothyroidism, hepatotoxicity and renal events were higher in the Indication Safety Set than in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. 
The comparison of the Indication Safety Set with Pembrolizumab Monotherapy demonstrated considerably 
lower incidences for pembrolizumab monotherapy across all TEAEs categories. Incidences of all-grade 
AEOSIs were 60.8% vs. 25.1%; the higher incidence in the Indication Safety Set was primarily driven by 
hypothyroidism (47.2% vs 11.1%), but increased rates were also observed for hyperthyroidism, adrenal 
insufficiency, severe skin reactions, and pancreatitis.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Higher incidences in the older age subgroups than in the <65 years age subgroup were reported for 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, SAEs, fatal SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation (In the ≥65 to <75 years age 
group, 43.0% of subjects).  More patients >75 years of age in the combination treatment arm had 
proteinuria events compared to the other age groups, and generally females experienced more Grade ≥3 
events then males. However, given the imbalances in these stratification factors (14.66% and 28.4% of 
all combination treatment subjects) it is difficult to ascertain whether these observations have any clinical 
meaning. More than half of the patients (55.6%) in the ≥75 years age group discontinued either 
lenvatinib or pembrolizumab, compared to 29.5% in the younger age group <65 years; however, data for 
subjects with an age of ≥75 years are limited due to the small patient numbers in the Indication Safety 
Set (n=45). 
Hypothyroidism 
Though the higher incidence of low grade events in the combination treatment may be due to an additive 
effect of both constituent components, it is not clear whether this may potentially lead to an 
interdependent worsening of the severity in some patients. 
Renal events 
It is not immediately clear why there was slightly higher incidence of Grade 3 events in the lenvatinib + 
pembrolizumab treatment group, despite the overall all-grade incidence being similar to the sunitinib one.  
Arterial thromboembolic events 
More subjects experienced myocardial infarction in the Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set (3.4% vs. 1.3%, respectively); however these increases were also associated 
with higher cardiovascular risk factors in the RCC population. The difference in overall events between 
both treatment groups may potentially be caused by the large number of patients with pre-existing risk 
factors in the former.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The superiority of lenvatinib-pembrolizumab treatment over sunitinib was demonstrated for the primary 
endpoint PFS, supported by differences in terms of ORR. The OS data were still immature at the time of 
submitted interim analyses,with the maturity reported of 29.6 % in the lenvatinib-pembrolizumab arm 
and 34.2 % in the sunitinib arm for most recent updated data. Currently available data indicate 
advantage in OS.  
A higher rate of all adverse event categories (particularly grade 3-5 AES, SAEs and drug discontinuations 
due to TEAEs) was observed for the combination of pembrolizumab with lenvatinib. A higher rate of dose 
adjustments (dose reductions, interruptions) and discontinuation due to AEs was observed in the 
combination arm, also based on exposure-adjusted rates.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib demonstrated superiority vs sunitinib in PFS in patients 
with advanced RCC, supported by an advantage in terms of OS and ORR. The main source of uncertainty, 
at present, remains the immaturity of OS data in the favourable risk group.  
For 1L treatment of subjects with advanced RCC, the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
compares less favourable to sunitinib. In Study 307/KEYNOTE-581, a higher rate of all adverse event 
categories (particularly grade 3-5 AES, SAEs and drug discontinuations due to TEAEs) was observed for 
the combination of pembrolizumab with lenvatinib. A higher rate of dose adjustments (dose reductions, 
interruptions) and discontinuation due to AEs was observed in the combination arm, also based on 
exposure-adjusted rates. 
The benefits of the combination treatment are considered to outweigh the risks in the overall population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab is positive. The MAH is recommended to 
submit the final OS analysis (including analyses/KM plots from favourable prognosis subgroups) from the 
E7080-G000-307/KEYNOTE 581 study which is comparing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in 
combination with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus everolimus vs. sunitinib monotherapy as a first-Line 
treatment of patients with advanced RCC.

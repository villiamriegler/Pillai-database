As a biosimilar to Remicade IV, Remsima IV is approved in adult patients for treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA), and psoriasis (Ps). Remsima SC has been approved for treatment of RA in the line 
extension EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062. 
With this indication extension variation the MAH seeks to add indications CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps to the 
Remsima SC pharmaceutical form to be in line with the IV formulation.
While there are several other subcutaneously administered TNFα-inhibitors on the market, infliximab is 
available only in IV formulation for CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps patients. 
Compared to the approved IV Remsima, the line extension with a subcutaneous formulation principally 
introduced two major changes; 1) different pharmacokinetics and 2) flat dosing (after IV loading dosed 
according to mg/kg). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 8/157
The development of this formulation focused on whether a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab may 
differ from IV infliximab in both efficacy and safety because of the different pharmacokinetic profile, 
with lower peak concentrations, higher Ctrough values and a more even concentration time curve. In 
addition, differences in exposure and intrinsic immunogenicity of the subcutaneous administration 
route could alter the immunogenic response. The potential consequences of flat dosing were also of 
special interest, in particular for individuals that belong to the extremes with regards to body weight. 
In the line extension application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062), non-inferior efficacy and safety was 
shown for Remsima SC 120mg Q2W compared to Remsima IV 3mg/kg in RA patients. On Remsima SC 
dosing the mean AUC-values and Ctrough levels were constantly and in long-term higher compared to 
Remsima IV.  The number of patients (157) exposed to long term treatment with Remsima SC was 
limited and some uncertainty remained regarding the effect of higher Ctrough levels of infliximab on the 
potential risk of some rare adverse events. Moreover, data on safety and immunogenicity among 
patients without the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication (CIM) was lacking.
The main focus of this assessment is comparability of PK, with supporting evidence of non-inferior 
efficacy and safety between Remsima SC and Remsima IV across all proposed indications. The main 
concerns in relation to the new proposed indications (CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps) is appropriate dosing 
and the possibility of higher immunogenicity in some target populations due to a lower rate of 
methotrexate (MTX) or other CIM in these populations.
2.1.2.  About the product
The active substance of Remsima is infliximab, an immunosuppressant TNFα-inhibitor (L04AB02). 
Infliximab was first authorised in the EU on 13 August 1999 under the name of Remicade. Remsima 
was initially developed for intravenous (IV) infusion (hereafter referred to as Remsima IV) and was 
approved in the EU in September 2013 (EMEA/H/C/002576) as a biosimilar product to Remicade. 
Following a line extension application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062), the subcutaneous formulation 
(Remsima SC) was approved for treatment of RA. Notably, the originator Remicade does not have a 
SC-formulation. 
Remsima SC is formulated at 120 mg/mL and presented as a solution for injection in a pre-filled 
syringe or pen. Each syringe or pen is designed to deliver a single dose of 120 mg infliximab in 1 mL 
solution. Remsima SC drug product has three presentations: a pre-filled syringe (PFS), a pre-filled 
syringe with a passive safety guard (PFS-S) and a pre-filled pen (also referred to as auto-injector AI) 
assembled with PFS. 
The dose of Remsima IV depends on the therapeutic indication: in RA patients the recommended 
dose is 3 mg/kg (up to a maximum maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/kg every 8 weeks or 3mg/kg every 4 
weeks in case of inadequate response or loss of response) and in CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps the dose is 5 
mg/kg. Treatment is initiated with infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6, followed by maintenance infusions 
every 8 weeks (Q8W) in RA, CD, UC, PsA and Ps or every 6-8 weeks in AS. In case of inadequate 
response or loss of response, the label includes an option to increase the dose in CD patients. No 
maximum dose is stated in the SmPC, but the studies referred to have used 10mg/kg Q8W. 
The proposed dose for Remsima SC is 120 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) for all patients in all indications, 
initiated as maintenance therapy 4 weeks after the last administration of two intravenous infusions of 
infliximab given 2 weeks apart.

EMA/376884/2020 
Page 9/157
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice
The clinical development programme for Remsima SC (CT-P13 SC) includes two phase I -studies in 
healthy volunteers; CT-P13 1.5 and CT-P13 1.9, one phase I-study in IBD; CT-P13 1.6, and one phase 
I/III-study in RA; CT-P13 3.5. A total of 751 subjects (235 HVs, 363 RA, 79 CD and 74 UC patients) 
received at least 1 dose of CT-P13 SC in the 4 controlled, comparative, clinical studies during the 
development of CT-P13 SC. 
Multiple central Scientific Advices (January 2016, September 2016, December 2017, April 2018) have 
been given. Issues that were discussed included selection of comparator for the comparability analysis, 
endpoints, non-inferiority margin and the overall extent and nature of data required to support the 
application. The use of Remsima IV as a comparator was agreed on; it was stated that there is no 
regulatory requirement to repeat the demonstration of biosimilarity against the reference product once 
the marketing authorization has been granted. It was commented that if non-inferior efficacy could be 
demonstrated in the RA setting and PK data from an IBD population would show similar exposure and 
Ctrough levels between SC and IV formulations, full extrapolation to other indications should be possible, 
given that SC dosing and regimen schedules for both the rheumatology and the IBD indications were 
identified.
It was further commented that the safety database should be sufficiently large to provide for a 
meaningful comparison of safety and immunogenicity; one year of comparative assessment of 
immunogenicity was considered critical to assess the benefit/risk of the proposed SC formulation given 
the high level of ADA with Remsima IV and the known much higher immunogenicity of the SC route. It 
was clarified that an indirect comparison to historical IV immunogenicity data could be acceptable.
Overall, the MAH appears to have followed the advice given by CHMP with regards to key aspects of 
the development programme.
The MAH states that the clinical development programme of CT-P13 SC has specifically considered the 
EU guidelines for clinical trials and biotechnology products. No important deviations from relevant 
CHMP guidance with implications for the overall interpretation of data have been noted. 
The proposed extension to the indications in this variation application is supported by the results from 
the currently submitted Study CT-P13 1.6 in IBD patients and by the following information:
The previously submitted results of pivotal Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, conducted in 343 patients 
with RA, which demonstrated:
o
o
Therapeutic  non-inferiority  in  terms  of  the  change  from  baseline  in  disease  activity 
measured  by  disease  activity  score  in  28  joints  (DAS28)  at  Week  22  and  comparable 
efficacy outcomes of Remsima SC to Remsima IV in American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR)  responses,  Health  assessment  questionnaire  (HAQ),  European  League  Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or CRP) 
and study short-form health survey (SF-36).
Comparable  safety  profile,  except  for  the  increased  incidence  of  localised  ISRs  in  the 
SC  group,  including  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE), 
treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  (TESAE)  and  adverse  events  of  special 
interest (AESI) between Remsima SC and Remsima IV. Patients in the Remsima IV arm 
switched  from  Remsima  IV  to  SC  treatment  at  Week  30  and  the  long-term  safety 
profile  of  Remsima  SC  was  assessed  up  to  Week  54,  which  showed  that  no  new  or 
unexpected safety findings were observed after the switching.

Additional information comes from the Population PK and PK-PD modelling (developed based on data 
obtained from CT-P13 SC studies conducted in RA and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients 
[Studies CT-P13 3.5 and CT-P13 1.6]), from post-hoc analyses of efficacy and safety by region, age, 
race and body weight and from a literature review on the PK-efficacy/safety correlation in AS, PsA and 
Ps populations.
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
Based on the provided data no need for triggered GLP or GCP inspections have been identified. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr2 and draft Rev. 1.), environmental risk assessment was submitted, 
with the justification of not submitting the ERA studies. The active substance is naturally occurring 
substance (protein), not posing a risk to the environment. The SC formulation does not contain such 
compounds that would lead to a significant increase of risk to the environment. In conclusion, the new 
indication is not leading to increase of the environmental risk for use of Remsima.
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.
Considering  that  the  active  substance  is  a  naturally  occurring  substance,  the  new  indications  of 
Remsima (infliximab) are not expected to pose a risk to the environment.
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
This indication extension variation is based on the whole clinical package presented in Table 1. The 
studies (except for CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 in IBD-patients) have been assessed within the line extension 
application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062). 
In summary, the benefit of Remsima SC has been demonstrated in RA-patients with concomitant 
methotrexate use. Clinical efficacy of Remsima SC as measured by DAS28 change/ACR 20 response 
was non inferior to Remsima IV. Exposure in terms of Cmax, Ctrough and AUC is not identical following 
administration of Remsima SC and Remsima IV. Cmax levels are several folds lower and Ctrough levels 
are several folds higher following Remsima SC 120mg Q2W, compared with Remsima IV 3mg/kg Q8W. 
Mean AUC levels over 8-week dosing are higher or slightly lower following the proposed SC dosing 
regimens, depending on the patient’s body weight. These findings were supported by the small dose 
finding studies in RA and IBD patients.
The safety profiles for SC and IV were in general comparable. The only new unfavourable effect 
identified after SC dosing were injections site reactions. Also immunogenicity seemed comparable 
between SC and IV formulations. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 11/157
There is still relatively limited safety data that would allow for a complete comparative safety 
assessment of Remsima SC with Remsima IV. However, the planned post-approval observational 
safety study to collect further safety data was considered acceptable. 
This assessment report will focus on the previously unassessed Part 2 of Study CT-P13 1.6. 
Extrapolation of the combined results from the whole clinical package to indications not studied 
(ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis) is discussed in relevant PK, Efficacy and Safety 
sections and also in the benefit-risk discussion.
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC were compared with Remsima IV in subjects with CD and UC in study 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (dose finding) and Part 2 (dose confirming). PK of Remsima SC have also been 
investigated in subjects with RA (study CT-P13 3.5) and in healthy subjects (studies CT-P13 1.5 and 
CT-P13 1.9); these studies were assessed in procedure X/62. 
Pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC were not investigated in subjects with AS, Ps and PsA, which is in 
accordance with the scientific advice given by the CHMP. Extrapolation to these therapeutic indications 
is discussed in Sections 2.4.3, 2.5.1 and section 5 of this AR. 
Methods
Bioanalytical methods
For Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2, a meso scale discovery (MSD) ECL method was used for the 
quantitation of CT-P13 in serum samples. The method has been originally validated during 2017. 
For immunogenicity testing, the MAH has developed a new ADA method based on an ECL MSD 
platform with an affinity capture elution (ACE) step, which displays enhanced drug tolerance. 
Additionally, a new NAb ECL MSD immunoassay was developed with ACE step in order to improve drug 
tolerance and selectivity in the presence of lipaemia. For Studies CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and 2 and CT-P13 
3.5 Part 1 and Part 2, immunogenicity data are presented from both the original immunogenicity assay 
(ADA ELISA and NAb ECL bead methods) and the new immunogenicity assay (new ADA ECL ACE and 
NAb ECL ACE methods).
1. Determination of CT-P13 in human serum
1a. MSD ECL Method for the Quantitation of CT-P13 in Human Serum 
For Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay utilizing MSD 
technology was applied to quantify CT-P13 in human serum. The method has been validated originally 
in September 2017 by PPD laboratories. Since then three Addendums 5-7 have been generated. 
2. Determination of immunogenicity
As presented in the line extension (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062), ADA assessment was performed in 
Studies CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 1.9, CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 and CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and NAb assessment based on ECL and ECL bead 
methods. However, taking into consideration of the potential for drug interference due to the relatively 
high drug serum concentrations in samples taken from patients receiving CT-P13 SC, the MAH has 
developed new ADA assay methods based on an ECL platform with an ACE step, which displays 
enhanced drug tolerance.
2a. Assessment of anti-CT-P13 antibodies by ADA ECL ACE method
A new ADA ECL ACE method is based on an ECL platform with an ACE step. Additional validation was 
performed to evaluate selectivity and drug tolerance, and to determine screening and confirmatory cut 
points in CD and UC human sera, and to evaluate drug tolerance in RA Human serum. The new method 
is described in the dossier in more detail. ADA ECL ACE has been validated at PPD. 
A comparison of the original ADA ELISA and new ECL method with ACE step (new ADA ECL ACE 
method) both developed by PPD is provided in the dossier. Both the ADA ELISA and new ADA ECL ACE 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 15/157
methods employed a three-tiered approach consisting of (i) screening assay, (ii) 
specificity/confirmatory assay and (iii) titration and estimation of neutralising activity.
Comparing the sample analysis data from the original ADA ELISA method and the new ADA ECL ACE 
method in Studies CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2 and CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2, it was confirmed 
that most (> 87.8%) of the ADA positive samples in the original ADA ELISA method were also detected 
as ADA positive in the new ADA ECL ACE method (Table 2). Furthermore, many ADA negative samples 
in the original ADA ELISA method were determined to be ADA positive in the new ADA ECL ACE 
method.

The CHMP noted that the MAH has developed a new method for detection of ADA against infliximab in 
human serum samples. The rationale for the development of a new method is acceptable as better 
drug tolerance was sought due to high drug concentration in Remsima SC serum samples. In the new 
method, ADAs are detected using an ECL immunoassay that employs MSD platform. 
Method validation
The new ADA ECL ACE method has been validated by PPD Laboratories during 2019. Full validation 
report is provided and validation acceptance criteria have been described in the method validation 
plan. Additionally, one addendum is provided to extend the method validation evaluation to CD, UC, 
and RA serums. 
In general, the new ADA ECL ACE method has been appropriately validated. Negative and positive 
controls are appropriately described. Commercial human monoclonal anti-infliximab serves as a 
positive control. CoA of the positive control is provided including sufficient characterization information 
of the control antibody.  Matrix-based negative control pools were prepared by pooling 30 individual 
drug-naïve sample lots with no detectable ADA. 
3. Neutralising antibodies
For measuring NAb against CT-P13, originally a NAb ECL bead method was used for Studies CT-P13 
1.6 Part 1 up to Week 54 and Part 2 up to Week 30 and CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 up to Week 54. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 16/157
Of note, these validation and bioanalytical reports for the NAb ECL bead method for Studies CT-P13 
1.6 Part 1 and CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 were included in the CT-P13 SC line extension 
(EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062).
Subsequently, a new ECL immunoassay with ACE Step was used for Studies CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and 
Part 2 and CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2  in order to improve drug tolerance and selectivity under the 
influence of lipaemia. The validation and bioanalytical reports for the new NAb ECL ACE method are 
included in this submission.
Comparing the sample analysis data from the original NAb bead method and the new NAb ECL ACE 
method in Studies CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2 and CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2, it was confirmed 
that most (> 93.1%) of the NAb positive samples in the original NAb bead method were also detected 
as NAb positive in the new NAb ECL ACE method (Table 3). Furthermore, many NAb negative samples 
in the original NAb ECL bead method turned out to be NAb positive in the new NAb ECL ACE method. 
Therefore, the new NAb ECL ACE method was considered to provide reproducible and reliable data with 
minimised interference by residual drug in serum.

The CHMP noted the following:
NAb ECL ACE method validation
New NAb ECL ACE method has been validated during 2019 by PPD Laboratories. Sufficient description 
of the method and method validation has been provided.  Validation included evaluation of MRD, 
sensitivity, intra- and inter-assay precision, matrix interference, drug tolerance, and assay sensitivity. 
Assay validity in healthy and diseased matrices has been considered.
Furthermore, characteristics of the negative and positive controls are provided.  Positive control pools 
were prepared by spiking positive control antibodies into the negative control pool. Human Anti-
Infliximab MAb was used as positive control antibody. The negative control pool used for the previous 
ECL bead method was also used for ECL ACE method.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 17/157
Non-parametric fixed cut point values (screening and titre cut points) were determined for CD/UC 
serum, whereas for RA serum a parametric approach was applied for determination of cut point values. 
According to cut point validation reports, floating SNR cut points were used for RA, as well as CD and 
UC serum samples. 
Inter-assay precision data did not meet the acceptance criteria. According to MAH, precision did not 
meet the acceptance criteria due to highly variable NC RLU responses. Thus, SNRs were determined 
meeting the acceptance criteria for SNR precision. The MAH’s effort to justify the variable inter-assay 
precision is acknowledged, however, not totally understood. Generally, CV of inter-assay precision 
should not exceed 20% and should preferably be ˂15%. Thus, with CV% values outside the 
acceptance criteria, the repeatability of the assay is questionable.  The MAH was asked to clarify the 
root-cause for this high variability and discuss the impact of the high inter-run variability on the 
repeatability of the assay.
The MAH responded appropriately to the clarifications requested. The approach to employ SNR CV% is 
considered acceptable. 
Comparison of the original and new method
The MAH has appropriately justified the rationale for the choice of the assay format. No full cross-
validation between methods has been performed and no acceptance criteria for the method 
comparability has been set. However, in this particular case, direct comparison of the data between 
different clinical studies is not considered necessary, as such, and cross-validation of the methods is 
not necessary to pursue further. 
A brief discussion on the comparability of new and old NAb method has been provided. The MAH 
considered basis on the selection of MRD, description of the negative and positive controls, justification 
on assay cut points, as well as discussion of drug tolerance limit in relation to residual drug levels in 
serum samples. 
Sample analysis data of the original and the new NAb method were compared. The data from the 
original NAb bead method and the new NAb ECL ACE method in Studies CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2 
and CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 confirmed that over 93.1% of the NAb positive samples in the 
original NAb bead method were also detected as NAb positive in the new NAb ECL ACE method. 
Furthermore, great part of the samples confirmed negative with the original NAb bead method showed 
positive in the new NAb ECL ACE method. 
According to MAH, the new NAb ECL ACE method have better sensitivity (no comparability results 
provided) and drug tolerance than the original NAb bead method. Additionally, according to MAH, the 
new method showed improved selectivity in lipaemic matrices during validation. The CHMP agreed with 
this analysis.
Statistical analyses (study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2)
The primary PK endpoint, observed serum infliximab pre-dose level at Week 22 (Ctrough,week22), was 
analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed effect and current use of 
treatment with azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or methotrexate (MTX) (used or not 
used), disease (CD or UC), clinical response at Week 6 (responder or non-responder by CDAI-70 for 
CD or partial Mayo score for UC), body weight at Week 6 (<80 kg or ≥80 kg) fitted as covariates in 
patients who received all doses (full) of study drug up to Week 22 (prior to Week 22) for the PK 
population. The Ctrough,week22 was natural log transformed prior to analysis. Point estimates (geometric 
least square (LS) means and ratio of geometric LS means) were calculated by back transforming the 
LS means of the natural log transformed values of Ctrough,week22 and difference in the LS means. Two-
sided 90% CI of the ratio geometric LS means were also produced. Noninferiority of Remsima SC to 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 18/157
Remsima IV was concluded if the lower bound of two-sided 90% CI for the ratio of geometric LS 
means is higher than 80%.
Population PK models
The MAH recently performed population PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation to support the 
marketing authorisation application for Remsima SC in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This 
population PK (PPK) model, hereafter referred to as the 1st PPK model, was assessed in application 
X/62. It was based on data from 7 clinical studies, including study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 (RA 
patients) and study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (CD patients) where Remsima SC was compared with Remsima 
IV.
In brief, the 1st PPK model was a 2-compartment PK model with linear elimination from the central 
compartment. Infliximab could be administered either directly into the central compartment as an IV 
infusion, or into a depot compartment as a subcutaneous injection with a first order absorption rate 
(KA) into the central compartment. Bioavailability (F) after SC administration was estimated. An 
allometric scaling approach with estimated exponents was adopted on central and peripheral volume 
(V1 and V3, respectively) and clearance and intercompartmental clearance (CL and Q, respectively). 
Between-subject variability was estimated for CL and V1. Emergence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 
neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (NAB) and concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) were incorporated 
in a time-dependent manner. The residual error was described with a proportional error model. 
The 1st PPK model was considered sufficient for the intended use, although it was likely that that 
parameterisation of the effects of ADA and NAB on clearance was not optimal. In addition, it was noted 
that the bioanalytical methods used for measurement of ADA and NAB were sensitive for drug 
interference.
Subsequently, the MAH developed the 2nd PPK model, which is described in the modelling report 
“Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of CDAI and Mayo scores, safety, ESR and C-
Reactive Protein in patients with active Crohn’s disease and active ulcerative colitis – Part 2”. It was 
based on data from 8 clinical studies in patients and healthy volunteers, including study CT-P13 3.5 
Part 1 and Part 2 (RA patients) and study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (CD patients) and Part 2 (CD and UC 
patients). The ADA and NAB data that were used in developing the 2nd PPK model were still obtained 
from the immunogenicity assays that were sensitive for drug interference, which diminishes the impact 
of the 2nd PPK model (and related PK/PD models) on the current variation application.
Finally, the MAH developed the 3rd PPK model, which is the most important PPK analysis for the current 
application. 
The 3rd PPK model
An abbreviated summary report “Population Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Modeling and 
Simulation using Immunogenicity Titer on CT-P13 PK, CDAI and Mayo Scores in Patients with Active 
Crohn’s Disease and Active Ulcerative Colitis”, was submitted by the MAH. 
The 3rd PPK model was based on data from study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 (RA patients) and study 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (CD patients) and Part 2 (CD and UC patients). ADA and NAB samples for these 
studies were re-analysed using the improved immunogenicity assays that were less sensitive for drug 
interference. Immunogenicity data from single-dose studies in healthy subjects and from older studies 
comparing Remsima IV with Remicade IV were not reanalysed; therefore, data from these studies 
were omitted. 
The objectives of the 3rd population PK analysis were to:



Evaluate  the  impact  of  ADA  titer  and  NAB  status  on  infliximab  clearance  and  update  the  PPK 
model  by  incorporating  the  relationship  between  ADA  titers/NAB  status  and  infliximab 
clearance into the model as needed. 
Conduct  simulations  to  predict  steady  state  exposure  (AUC8w,ss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Ctrough,ss)  of 
infliximab in subjects with different body weights and different ADA titers/NAB status following 
two maintenance dosing regimens (120 mg SC Q2W, 5 mg/kg IV Q8W)
The updated PPK model was subsequently used for efficacy PK/PD analyses in patients with CD and 
UC; see section “PK/PD modelling” in this AR.  
Datasets: The existing dataset for the previous PK and PK/PD analyses (The 2nd population PK/PD 
analysis) was used as the starting point for developing new dataset in this population PK and PK/PD 
analysis. The existing dataset contained information on PK, patient characteristics and other covariates 
of interest, and clinical efficacy and safety from 8 studies (IV studies [CT-P13 1.1, CT-P13 1.4, CT-P13 
3.1, and CT-P13 3.4] and SC/IV studies [CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 3.5, CT-P13 1.6, and CT-P13 1.9]). The 
new dataset for the current analysis was created by keeping only the records for subjects from Study 
CT-P13 1.6 (Part 1 and Part 2) and 3.5 (Part 1 and Part 2) and appending the dataset with newly 
available ADA titer values and NAB status data to replace the previous immunogenicity data. If all 
scheduled ADA/NAB observations for the individual were missing, that individual was excluded. Last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) was applied to impute missing and incomplete ADA titer after a 
non-missing record. NAB status was treated as “once positive, remain positive.”
PK, PD and immunogenicity data up to Week 30 was included for Study CP-P13 1.6 Part 2 while PK, PD 
and immunogenicity data for Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 and Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 were up 
to end of study (Week 54). BLQ observations (10.1% and 10.2% of all observations for IV and SC 
dosing, respectively) were excluded. A total of 6864 infliximab concentration observations obtained 
from 571 subjects were available for analysis.
Model development: The 2nd PPK model was employed as the starting point. It was a 2-compartment 
IV infusion model with linear first-order elimination from the central compartment, and an additional 
depot compartment with a first-order SC absorption rate constant term linked to the central 
compartment. Both clearance (CL and Q) and volume of distribution parameters (V1 and V3) were 
allometrically scaled with estimated allometric exponents as a part of the structural model. The effect 
of immunogenicity on the PK of infliximab was characterized via a covariate relationship between ADA 
status (positive vs. negative) and clearance. It was assumed that once a patient demonstrated a 
positive ADA response, they remained positive (once positive, remain positive) through the rest of the 
study. Independent random effects to describe the unexplained between subject variability (BSV) in 
clearance and the central compartment volume of distribution (assuming a log-normal distribution 
across the population) and a normally distributed additive residual error of the log-transformed 
concentration data (equivalent to a proportional residual error model on the untransformed scale) were 
integrated into the model.
The 3rd PPK model relating ADA titer value and NAB status with infliximab clearance was developed 
step-by-step as follows. First, the ADA status parameter in the previous (2nd) population PK model was 
removed. Inter-occasion variability (IOV) on clearance corresponding to different ADA sampling 
interval was introduced (run 304; see Table 7 and 8) to examine the relationship of clearance and ADA 
titer and NAB status at each ADA sampling intervals. The PK data of studies CT-P13 1.6 and CT-P13 
3.5 were fitted to the model to obtain the individual clearance estimates associated with the different 
ADA titer values and NAB status.

Second, the individual clearance estimates were plotted against the corresponding ADA titer and NAB 
status to explore the relationship between ADA titer/NAB status and clearance. ADA titer was treated 
as a continuous variable. As shown in Figure 1 without considering the NAB status, estimated 
infliximab clearance increased with the ADA titer values. Infliximab clearance for positive NAB was 
higher than clearance for negative NAB or N/A (no measurable ADA response). In the observed data, 
proportion of NAB- patients with high ADA titer value from 27 to 243 was significantly lower than 
proportion of NAB- patients with low ADA titer value from 1 to 9 (2.50 % vs. 49.17 %, respectively). 
Therefore, the NAB status effect was considered to have a pivotal role in determining the effect of ADA 
on PK, especially for the ADA titer range of 1 to 9.

Figure 1 Impact of ADA titer and NAB status on estimated clearance of infliximab.
Third, the relationship between ADA titer/NAB status and clearance was evaluated in the population PK 
model. A summary of model runs is presented in Table 4. The ADA titer-dependent increase in 
infliximab clearance was described using a power model (run305) and a linear model (run305b). The 
power model resulted lower OFV and was chosen to describe the impact of ADA titer on infliximab 
clearance. A NAB flag was subsequently introduced into the clearance model to turn on the effect of 
ADA titer on infliximab clearance at positive NAB and turn off at negative NAB (run308). Run308 
resulted in a further decrease in OFV of 177.1 and was declared as the final population PK model. The 
final population PK model is presented in Figure 2.
Additional models were also tested as per request of the CHMP but no meaningful improvement of the 
fit was observed. Run308 remained the final population PK model.

Diagnostic plots and pcVPC plots at steady state (Weeks 22 to 30) for the final population PK model 
are presented in Figures below. The MAH concluded that the model generally described the observed 
data adequately and that the pcVPC overall confirmed that the final population PK model generally 
captured the central tendency of the observed data, with an acceptable characterization of the 
variability generally observed for both routes of administration.

Absorption
Pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC (120 mg, 180 mg and 240 mg) compared with Remsima IV (3 mg/kg 
and 5 mg/kg) after a single dose were explored in healthy subjects (N = 6 to 10 in each cohort) in a 
parallel-group study CT-P13 1.5 (see ARs of process X/62). Median Tmax was at approximately 170 h 
(range 72 to 314 h) in each SC cohort. The mean bioavailability was 60.56% (90% CI 51.93% - 
70.63%) for overall Remsima SC cohorts. 
The estimated typical bioavailability for Remsima SC was 57.6%, 57.5% and 72.1% in the 1st, the 2nd 
and the 3rd population PK model, respectively.    
Distribution
The parameter estimates from the population PK model and previous noncompartmental analyses 
indicate that infliximab is largely constrained to systemic circulation, with a volume of distribution of 
approximately 5 to 6 litres. 
Elimination
No new data on routes of excretion and metabolism were submitted and none are required. It is 
expected that elimination mechanisms of subcutaneously and intravenously administered infliximab are 
similar. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies
Pharmacokinetics of Remsima IV is linear over the approved dose range.

Results of three parallel-group studies (CT-P13 1.5; CT-P13 3.5 Part 1; CT-P13 1.6 Part 1) indicated 
that following SC injection, exposure increased approximately in proportion with dose over the dose 
range 90 mg to 240 mg. See ARs of process X/62 for detailed assessment.

Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1
Design: Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study. 
The primary objective for Part 1 was to find the optimal dose of Remsima SC in patients with active 
CD. The secondary objective for Part 1 was to evaluate efficacy, PK, PD and overall safety of Remsima 
SC in comparison with Remsima IV. Only descriptive statistics of the data were provided, in accordance 
with the statistical analysis plan.
The overview of study design is illustrated in Figure 5. During the dose-loading phase, all enrolled 
patients initially received Remsima IV infusion (5 mg/kg) at Weeks 0 and 2. Patients who received 2 
full doses and for whom there were no safety concerns based on the investigator’s discretion were 
randomly assigned on week 6 into 4 study cohorts: Remsima IV 5 mg/kg Q8W (n=13); Remsima SC 
120 mg Q2W (n=11); Remsima SC 180 mg Q2W (n=12); Remsima 240 mg SC Q2W (n=8).
Figure 5 Overview of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1.
Frequent PK samples were collected at steady state between Week 22 to Week 30. Individual serum 
concentration data over actual time data will be used to calculate PK parameters of infliximab were 
calculated by standard non-compartmental methods using individual concentration data and actual 
time after dose. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 27/157
Results: The PK population consisted of 41 patients. One randomised patient was excluded from the PK 
population in the SC 240 mg cohort due to major protocol deviation (wrong dose administered at week 
6), and 2 additional patients were excluded from the PK population in the IV 5 mg/kg and SC 240 mg 
cohort because they did not have any concentration data after Week 6 administration.
Overall, demographic characteristics were generally well balanced among the 4 cohorts. The median 
(min, max) baseline weight was 68.60 (44.6, 95.0), 71.0 (47.0, 87.9), 71.0 (43.0, 105.0) and 70.25 
(43.0, 105.0) kg in the IV 5 mg/kg, SC 120 mg, SC 180 mg and SC 240 mg cohorts, respectively.
Mean (± SD) serum concentrations of infliximab versus time by cohort during the PK monitoring period 
(from Week 22 to Week 30) are presented in Figure 6. Descriptive statistics of the observed Ctrough 
and steady state AUC normalised to 8-week interval (AUCss8W) are shown in Tables below.

Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2
See section 2.4.2 (Clinical efficacy / Main studies) for details of study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2. The PK 
population (n=127) consisted of the all-randomized population who received at least 1 full dose of 
study drug at Week 6 or thereafter and who had at least 1 PK concentration result after Week 6 
treatment.
The primary endpoint of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 was the observed serum infliximab pre-dose level at 
Week 22 (Ctrough,week22). Population PK analysis was employed to estimate the other PK parameters 
(e.g. predicted trough and maximum serum concentrations (Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss, respectively) and AUC 
normalized to an 8-week interval (AUC8W,ss)).
PK parameters
Pre-dose PK samples were collected at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54. Additional PK samples 
were collected at steady state between weeks 22 and 30 (Table 9).

Observed infliximab levels
Serum infliximab concentrations versus time from Week 22 to Week 30 are presented in Figure 7. 
Descriptive statistics for the observed pre-dose concentrations are summarised in Table 10. After 
randomization at week 6, the mean pre-dose serum concentration levels were consistently higher in 
the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm compared to the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm; note that subjects 
randomised to Remsima IV were switched to Remsima SC at week 30. 
The geometric LS means of observed Ctrough,week22 were 20.9844 and 1.8181 μg/mL in the SC 120/240 
mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. The lower bound 90% CI for the ratio of the 
geometric LS means was 786.37%, which was greater than 80%, indicating noninferiority of Remsima

Predicted exposure
Infliximab exposure parameters at steady state following 120 mg Q2W SC and 5 mg/kg Q8W IV dosing 
regimens were simulated using the final 3rd PPK model (run308). Virtual patients with different body 
weights ranging from 50 kg to 150 kg were simulated assuming uniform distribution (1000 subjects 
per 10 kg weight band). For this virtual patient population, NAB status was assumed either negative or 
positive with ADA titer values of 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, or 243. 
Two separate simulations were performed. The simulation in NAB- patients, where immunogenicity had 
no impact on CL, was performed to investigate the effect of body weight on infliximab exposure. The 
simulation in NAB+ patients, where immunogenicity had impact on CL, was performed to investigate 
the effect of ADA titer on infliximab exposure. As the PPK model used continuous ADA titer values, it 
was difficult to investigate each impact of immunogenicity or body weight on PK when the ADA titer 
values are simultaneously incorporated into each of the weight strata. Therefore, the body weight was 
stratified (<80 kg or ≥80 kg).
Predicted infliximab Ctrough,ss and AUC over 8 weeks (AUC8w,ss) in NAB- patients following 120 mg Q2W 
SC and 5 mg/kg Q8W IV dosing regimens are presented below. The geometric mean ratio of exposure 
(SC/IV) was calculated for all patients and by each 10-kg body weight strata. The Ctrough,ss of infliximab 
SC was 2.63~10.62-fold higher than the Ctrough,ss of infliximab IV. As expected, the difference 
decreased in patients with high body weights. The AUC8w,ss of infliximab SC was 0.48~1.3-fold of 
AUC8w,ss infliximab IV. The Cmax,ss of infliximab SC was about 5~10- fold lower than Cmax,ss of infliximab 
IV, as expected.

The predicted infliximab Ctrough,ss following 120 mg Q2W SC and 5 mg/kg Q8W IV dosing regimens in 
patients with the highest ADA titer values (81 or 243) is presented in Figure 10. The exposures 
decreased with increasing ADA titer. 
The combined impact of body weight and NAB+ associated ADA titer value on infliximab exposure was 
explored. Infliximab steady state exposures following 120 mg Q2W SC dosing regimen in NAB+ 
patients with different body weights and ADA titer values (test population) were compared with the 
exposures in patients with a body weight of 80 kg and negative ADA status following 5 mg/kg Q8W IV 
infusion (reference population). The body weight in the test population ranged from 50 kg to 150 kg in 
this analysis and was stratified by <80 kg or ≥80 kg. Figure 11 and Figure 12 display the forest plots 
of Ctrough,ss and AUC8w,ss, respectively, showing the exposure in test population relative to the reference 
population. A similar trend was observed in changes in infliximab exposure as ADA titer increases 
regardless of body weight stratum.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Infliximab is a known active substance. It is a chimeric human murine immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms of tumour 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) preventing TNF from binding to its receptor and inducing associated 
cellular functions.
Primary and secondary pharmacology
Remsima SC contains the same active ingredient infliximab as Remsima IV. New studies were not 
conducted to investigate the primary and secondary pharmacology of infliximab.
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling
Exposure-response (ER) models for efficacy and safety were developed using predicted individual post-
hoc PK parameter estimates from the 2nd population PK model. Subsequently, the 3rd PPK model was 
developed (see section 2.3.2 Pharmacokinetics / Methods / Population PK models) and the ER efficacy 
analyses for CDAI and partial Mayo scores were re-evaluated using the predicted PK parameter 
estimates obtained with the 3rd PPK model. ER safety analyses were not re-run.

safety, ESR and C-Reactive Protein in patients with active Crohn’s disease and active ulcerative colitis 
– Part 2”.
Population PK/PD Analysis for CDAI Score in Patients with active Crohn’s disease
The population PK/PD modelling of CDAI score in CD patients was performed using the 2nd population 
PK model, along with the CDAI scores obtained from Studies CT-P13 3.4 (IV infliximab only, n=220) 
and CT-P13 1.6 Parts 1 and 2 (IV and SC infliximab, n=97). Patients were included in the analysis if 
they entered the active treatment phase of their trial, had at least one adequately documented 
infliximab administration and one adequately documented assessment of CDAI score. The analyses 
were performed in NONMEM employing first-order conditional estimation with η-ε interaction for all 
runs.
A total of 1236 quantifiable CDAI scores from 317 subjects were available for the model development, 
of which 19 negative observations were excluded as anomalous observations (the anticipated lower 
bound of potential CDAI scores is 0). An exploratory graphical data analysis of CDAI response versus 
time indicated a general trend towards reduction of the CDAI score during the induction phase from 
baseline (Week 0) to Week 6, after which the effect appeared to be maintained or further improved 
during the maintenance phase. Visual inspection did not indicate strong relationship between any of 
the covariates of interest and the reduction in CDAI scores following exposure to infliximab.
Individual patient simulated plasma concentrations were obtained from the individual patient post-hoc 
PK parameter estimates derived from the final population PK model. The CDAI response was initially 
(Run100) characterized by an indirect response model wherein an inhibitory probit transformed Imax 
model was used to describe the suppressive effect of infliximab on the zero-order rate constant of 
CDAI score production (kin), while the baseline CDAI score was defined as the ratio of kin to the first 
order rate constant of the amelioration of CDAI score (kout). Between-subject variability (BSV) was 
included in baseline CDAI and Imax. Residual variability was implemented with additive residual error 
structure. 
Further evaluation explored inclusion of additional BSV in kout and IC50 parameters. In both cases, the 
resulting goodness of fit plots indicated that inclusion of the additional parameters did not result in an 
improvement of the model performance. As a result, the additional parameters were deemed 
redundant and were not retained. Correlation between the BSV in baseline CDAI score and Imax 
(Run101) improved the fit and the off-diagonal element was retained in the model. Run101 was 
selected as the final base model and was carried forward to the covariate modeling.
Baseline CDAI score, disease duration, baseline albumin, age, gender, race (white vs non-white), and 
azathioprine co-medication (AZA) were investigated in covariate analyses. No covariate was deemed to 
provide meaningful improvement and the base model (Run101) was declared the final model. 
The final PK/PD model for CDAI obtained was an indirect-response model, parameterized with a probit 
transformed inhibitory Imax model to describe the suppressive effect of infliximab on the zero-order 
rate constant of CDAI score production (kin), and baseline CDAI response (R0) defined as the ratio of 
0 to the first order rate of the amelioration of CDAI response (kout). A schematic and the parameter 
kin
estimates of the final model are presented below. Results of the bootstrap analysis demonstrated 
minimal bias (<1% difference between parameter estimates in the final model and bootstrap 
parameters). However, the relative standard error for IC50 was very high (156%) in bootstrap 
indicating that the parameter was poorly estimated.

Population PK/PD analysis of partial Mayo scores for patients with active ulcerative colitis
A total of 455 quantifiable partial Mayo scores from 78 subjects from study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 until 
week 30 were available for the PK/PD model development. 
Initial base model development considered the partial Mayo score as an ordered categorical endpoint 
with values ranging from 0 to 8. However, the tested categorical models were not able to properly 
characterize the observed data. This was attributed to the absence of placebo data, the dosing 
schedule (i.e. loading phase up to week 6) and the limited number of observations in comparison with 
the number of model parameters (a categorical model has more parameters than a continuous model). 
As a result, model development switched to the continuous approach and a base model similar to the 
one employed to characterize the CDAI score in CD patients was pursued.
The initial continuous model (Run001) employed the final model from the previous analysis on the 
CDAI score with the aim of estimating only fixed effects and residual error. Subsequently, BSV on Imax, 
baseline partial Mayo score and kout were explored. All resulted in a statistically significant 
improvement of the model performance and were, as such, retained. The last attempt consisted in 
improving the characterization of the baseline partial Mayo score by changing its distribution from log-
normal to normal (consistent with the observed data; Run008) and implementing a logit 
transformation of the baseline partial Mayo score parameter to constrain it to range between the 
anticipated values of 0 to 8 (Run010). Scatterplots of the Bayesian post-hoc individual ETA estimates 
(kout, baseline partial Mayo score and Imax) from Run010 indicated no relevant correlation between any 
pair of parameters and the goodness of fit and pcVPC plots indicated adequate characterisation of the 
observed data. As a result, Run010 remained unchanged and was selected as the base model. Model 
structure and parameter estimates are displayed in Figure 14 and Table 13, respectively. The 
bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates, 61% of which converged successfully, with the remaining runs 
terminating due to rounding errors) indicated that IC50 and the additive residual error were poorly 
estimated.

A stepwise covariate approach was implemented to test the potential effect of pre-specified covariates 
(age, gender, concomitant azathioprine medication, disease duration, and baseline albumin level) on 
model parameters Imax, Kout and baseline partial Mayo score. Additionally, effect of baseline partial 
Mayo score on Imax was tested. None of them provided a statistically significant drop in the objective 
function value. Hence, the final base model (Run010) was selected as the final model. 
Safety Exposure-Response Analyses
A graphical exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate the exposure-response relationship for 
infections and infusion/injection-related reactions (IRR). No formal model-based analyses were 
performed. The safety analysis population comprised a total of 1611 patients from CD, UC, RA and AS 
Studies CT-P13 1.1, 1.6, 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5, with a total of 591 infection events (150 being related to 
treatment, mild and moderate severity) and 143 IRRs (73 of which were related to treatment, mild and 
moderate severity).
Boxplots of IRR and infections versus infliximab serum exposure (stratified by dosing route) showed no 
apparent difference in average steady-state AUC, Cmax or Ctrough in patients that experienced the event 
compared to those that did not, either in pooled analysis or in subgroups stratified by disease.
3rd PK/PD model
Population PK/PD Model of CDAI Scores 
A total of 591 quantifiable CDAI scores from 97 subjects in Study CT-P13 1.6 were available for the 
population PK/PD model of CDAI scores. The previously developed base model (Figure 13) was 
retained and re-run with individual infliximab plasma concentrations predicted using the 3rd population 
PK model (Run204). Parameter estimates of the model are presented in Table 14.

Exploratory graphical analysis of covariates effects (gender, race, age, concomitant medication 
(Azathioprine), disease duration, baseline CDAI score, and baseline albumin) on the post-hoc Bayesian 
parameter estimates did not suggest strong correlation between covariates and model parameters. 
Hence, the base model run 204 was declared as the final population PK/PD model for CDAI.
Visual inspection of the goodness of fit plots indicated that the model generally described the observed 
data well, although a small deviation from the expectation was noted in the CWRES versus Time Since 
First Dose plot. The pcVPC plots, stratified by route of administration, are presented in Figure 15. The

Predictive Check (Run020).
Prediction corrected observed partial Mayo scores are represented by black symbols. The median prediction corrected observed 
partial Mayo scores are represented by a black solid line. The 5th and 95th percentiles of the prediction corrected observed partial 
Mayo scores are represented by dashed blacklines. The grey shaded area represents the 95% CI of the median of the prediction 
corrected model predicted data. The blue shaded area represents the 95% CI of the 5th and 95th percentiles of the prediction 
corrected model predicted data. The pcVPC was obtained from the final model, including the residual error, resulting in the negative 
scores returned by the simulation.
PK/PD simulations
Two sets of simulations were performed for patients with CD and UC to investigate the effects of body 
weight and immunogenicity on efficacy. The simulations based on the NAB- patients were performed to 
investigate the effect of body weight alone by categorizing the body weight from 50 kg to 150 kg into 
10-kg weight strata. The simulations based on the NAB+ patients, where immunogenicity had impact 
on CL, were performed to investigate the effect of ADA titer; body weight was stratified by <80 kg or 
≥80 kg. Results of simulations with the 3rd PK/PD model are presented below.
Simulations of CDAI Scores: Figure 17 presents the SC (test) to IV (reference) geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) of the steady state CDAI scores stratified by 10-kg body weight strata. In all body weight 
strata, the GMRs were close to 1.0, suggesting no significant difference in efficacy between SC and IV 
treated NAB- patients with CD. Lower CDAI score indicates better clinical response, hence GMR < 1 
suggests better response for the SC dosing regimen.

ranged from 50 kg to 150 kg, positive NAB status, and ADA titer values of 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, or 243. In 
all ADA titer and weight strata, the GMRs were close to 1.0, suggesting no significant impact of ADA 
titer and body weight on efficacy following 120 mg Q2W SC dosing regimen in the simulated patient 
population with CD.

of ADA titer and body weight on efficacy following 120 mg Q2W SC dosing regimen in the simulated 
patient population with UC.
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Bioanalytics
The MAH has presented a method validation data on a meso scale discovery (MSD) ECL method that 
was used for the quantitation of CT-P13 in serum samples. The validation of MSS-ECL method to 
quantify the amount of CT-P13 in human serum has been previously accepted during line extension 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/2576/X/62). In this submission three addendums were provided to study 
analyte stability in frozen state and further evaluate dilutional parallelism of the method in different 
matrices. Adequate data was provided to demonstrate method validity. The MAH has provided 
adequate clarification on reanalyzed samples. An additional dilution was used for the reanalysis of 
samples for which the initial result was outside of the calibration curve. This is acceptable. Hence, it is 
agreed by CHMP that the assay used for study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 samples is accurate.
In addition, new MSD platform based methods were introduced for immunogenicity testing. The new 
ADA ECL ACE and new NAb ECL ACE methods used for ADA and NAb detection were adequately 
validated. A floating cut point approach was employed and the inter-assay precision %CV were 
calculated from normalized values (SNR). The MAH’s approach is considered acceptable. The %CV of 
SNR for both methods were below 20%, and the assays are repeatibile.

Pharmacokinetics
The MAH presents pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data for Remsima SC in patients with active CD 
or active UC in support of the current variation application. Recently, within the application X/62, data 
for Remsima SC in patients with RA and in healthy subjects were presented. 
Study CT-P13 1.6 was designed to find the optimal dose of Remsima SC and to demonstrate steady 
state Ctrough non-inferiority of Remsima SC to Remsima IV in patients with active CD or active UC. 
Ctrough was chosen as the exposure parameter of interest based on published scientific literature. 
Population PK (PPK) analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of immunogenicity on clearance 
of and exposure to infliximab. AUC and Cmax values are largely obtained using simulations with the PPK 
model. However, dense PK samples at steady state were collected in study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, which 
allowed calculation of AUC using noncompartmental analyses (NCA). 
In study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, the observed mean infliximab Ctrough at week 22 following Remsima SC 
120 mg (in subjects <80 kg; n=44) and 240 mg (in subjects ≥80 kg; n=15) Q2W were approximately 
6.8 fold and 8.9 fold higher, respectively, than following Remsima IV 5 mg/kg Q8W posology. The 
proposed posology is 120 mg SC Q2W for all patients with CD or UC; therefore, Ctrough in subjects with 
body weight ≥80 kg will be lower than that observed in study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 but still several folds 
higher than with the approved Remsima IV posology. Likewise, simulations using the PPK model 
indicated that infliximab Ctrough,ss of infliximab 120 mg SC Q2W was 2.63~10.62-fold higher than the 
Ctrough,ss of infliximab 5 mg/kg IV Q8W over weight from 50 kg to 150 kg, the difference decreasing 
with high body weights. 
The mean infliximab AUC over 8 weeks at steady state (AUC8W,ss) calculated using NCA in study CT-
P13 1.6 Part 1 was 28251 h*µg/mL for dosing regimen 120 mg SC Q2W (n=10, mean weight 68.2 kg), 
approximately 1.35-fold higher compared with dosing regimen 5 mg/kg IV Q8W (n=11, mean weight 
68.5 kg). For comparison, AUC8W,ss in RA patients treated with 120 mg SC Q2W in study CT-P13 3.5 
Part 1 was 20927 h*µg/mL (n=162, mean weight 73.1 kg). Simulations using the PPK model indicated 
that the AUC8w,ss of infliximab 120 mg SC Q2W was 0.48~1.3-fold of AUC8w,ss infliximab 5 mg/kg IV 
Q8W in subjects without anti-infliximab antibodies.
PK/PD analyses
PK/PD analyses for efficacy were conducted using clinically observed response as efficacy endpoints. 
The analyses suggested body weight and positive ADA/NAB response to have negligible impact on 
efficacy in CD and UC patients following the SC dosing 120 mg Q2W. However, the efficacy endpoints 
used in PK/PD analyses were from open-label studies without placebo group. Furthermore, all subjects 
were treated with IV infliximab for the first 6 weeks and a large part of the clinical response was 
achieved before randomization to IV or SC arm. These limitations are reflected in poor precision of 
some model parameters, e.g. IC50 values. Because the PK/PD analyses for efficacy are not considered 
to be essential for the overall benefit/risk assessment, these issues are not pursued by CHMP. 
Exploratory graphical PK/PD analyses for safety did not suggest strong associations between exposure 
and IRR and infections. The results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited number of events in 
patients treated with the SC formulation. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The population PK model sufficiently described the pharmacokinetics of infliximab in the studied 
populations and it can be used to support the current application.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy
2.4.1.  Dose response studies
Dose response for CT-P13 SC was evaluated in RA patients in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and in CD 
patients in study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1. The results of these two open-label studies were assessed in 
connection with the line extension application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062). Dose response regarding 
the other indications now sought is discussed in section 2.4.3.
2.4.2.  Main studies
This indication extension variation is based on the whole clinical package presented in before. The 
efficacy and safety of CT-P13 SC has previously been studied in RA patients in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 
and 2 and in CD patients in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1. These studies have been assessed within the 
initial line extension application. This assessment report will focus on Part 2 of Study CT-P13 1.6. 
Extrapolation of the combined results from the whole clinical package to indications not studied 
(ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis), is discussed in relevant PK, Efficacy and 
Safety sections and also in the benefit risk section.
Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2
Methods
Study CT-P13 1.6 was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, Phase I study designed 
to evaluate PK, efficacy, PD, and safety between CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients with active 
Crohn’s disease (CD) or active ulcerative colitis (UC) up to Week 54.
The study consisted of the following 2 parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 was designed to find the optimal 
dose of CT-P13 SC whereas Part 2 was designed to demonstrate that CT-P13 SC was non-inferior to 
CT-P13 IV, in terms of PK.
In the induction phase, all enrolled patients received two loading doses of 5mg/kg CT-P13 IV infusion 
at Weeks 0 and 2. Patients who received two full doses and for whom there were no safety concerns 
were randomly assigned to receive either CT-P13 SC or CT-P13 IV.
The duration of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 was up to 62 weeks, which included screening (up to 6 
weeks) and the last dose at 54 weeks, plus the following 2 weeks off-dose period, prior to the EOS 
visit.

CD: Crohn’s disease, IV: Intravenous, SC: Subcutaneous, UC: Ulcerative Colitis
Study participants
A total of 195 patients from 62 study centers in 16 countries were screened and 136 patients from 50 
study centers in 15 countries were enrolled in this study. Study centers included university hospitals, 
county hospitals, and several forms of medical centers and private clinics.
Male or female patients aged 18 to 75 years old, inclusive, with active CD or UC of at least 3 months’ 
disease duration prior to the first administration of the study drug (Day 0) were eligible. A patient who 
had active CD with a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score between 220 and 450 points or who 
had active UC with total Mayo score between 6 and 12 points with endoscopic subscore of ≥2 at 
screening was considered for enrolment in the study.
For CD patients, the patient had to have been treated for active CD, but had not responded despite a 
full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or was 
intolerant to or had medical contraindications for such therapies.

inhibitor for the treatment of other diseases. 
Patient  had  a  current  or  past  history  of  one  of  several  specified  infections,  including  HIV, 
hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis. 
Patient  with  CD  had  active  entero-vesical,  entero-retroperitoneal,  entero-cutaneous,  and 
entero-vaginal fistulae within 6 months prior to the first administration of the study drug (Day 
0). Entero-enteral fistulae without clinical significant symptoms upon investigator’s opinion and 
anal fistulae without draining problems were allowed. 
Patient  with  CD  had  more  than  three  small-bowel  resection  procedures  prior  to  the  first 
administration of the study drug (Day 0). 
Patient  with  UC  was  taking  rectally  administered  medications  containing  corticosteroids  or  5-
ASA for the treatment of UC within 2 weeks prior to screening.
Treatments
During the dose-loading phase, all enrolled patients initially received a 2-hour CT-P13 IV infusion at 
Weeks 0 and 2. Before treatment on week 6, patients who received 2 full doses and for whom there 
were no safety concerns based on the investigator’s discretion were randomly assigned to receive 
either CT-P13 SC or CT-P13 IV.
The maintenance phase of the study consisted of further doses of study drug with the last dose 
administered no later than Week 54.
•
Intravenous 5 mg/kg (Arm 1): further 3 doses of CT-P13 IV were administered at Week 6 
and  every  8  weeks  thereafter  up  to  Week  22  (Weeks  14  and  22).  CT-P13  IV  was  then 
switched  to  CT-P13  SC  at  Week  30  with  CT-P13  SC  dose  based  on  body  weight  at  Week 
30.  Further  doses  of  study  treatment  with  CT-P13  SC  were  given  every  2  weeks  up  to 
Week 54.
•
Subcutaneous 120 mg or 240 mg (Arm 2): CT-P13 SC dose based on body weight at Week 
6  was  administered  by  PFS  at  Week  6  and  then  every  2  weeks  up  to  Week  54.  Patients 
weighing < 80kg were given 120 mg and patients weighing ≥80 kg were given 240 mg.
For patients receiving CT-P13 SC 120 mg every 2 weeks, dose escalation to CT-P13 SC 240 mg every 
2 weeks was allowed from Week 30 if the patient initially responded, but then lost response at the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 51/157
Week 30, 38, 46, or 54 visits. Dose escalation was not allowed for patients receiving CT-P13 SC 240 
mg every 2 weeks.
Concomitant medication
Immunomodulators (such as AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) were allowed if patients maintained stable doses for 
the specified time frame according to the inclusion criteria and the stable dose was maintained 
throughout the study.
Oral corticosteroids at the equivalent dose of 20 mg/day of prednisone or less were allowed if the 
patient had received a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of the study 
drug (Day 0). For patients receiving corticosteroids at the first administration of the study drug (Day 
0), corticosteroid treatment was kept up to Week 6 at the same dose level. After Week 6, a specific 
tapering regimen could be followed if the patient’s condition had improved.
For CD, 5-ASA was allowed if patients maintained stable doses for the specified timeframe according to 
the inclusion criteria and the stable dose was maintained throughout the study.
For UC, only oral 5-ASA was allowed if patients maintained stable doses for the specified timeframe 
according to the inclusion criteria and the stable dose was maintained throughout the study.
The following medications and treatments during the study period were prohibited: antibiotics for the 
treatment of CD or UC and for UC patients, rectally administered medications containing 
corticosteroids or 5-ASA.
The CHMP considered that the use of a concomitant immunomodulatory medication was evenly 
distributed between treatment arms in both patient groups. Data on tapering of corticosteroid dose was 
not provided or included in efficacy estimands. In this small open-label setting, where efficacy was a 
secondary outcome, this was considered acceptable.
Objectives
The overall objective of this study was to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety between 
subcutaneous (SC) CT-P13 and intravenous (IV) CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease

C-reactive protein (CRP)
Safety assessments were secondary endpoints and were performed on immunogenicity tests, 
hypersensitivity monitoring (including delayed hypersensitivity monitoring), vital sign measurements 
(including blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates, and body temperature), weight, body mass 
index (BMI), interferon-γ release assay (IGRA), diabetes mellitus assessment, congestive heart failure 
assessment, chest x-ray, hepatitis B and C and HIV -1 and -2 status, physical examination findings, 
electrocardiograms (ECG), adverse events (AEs; including serious AEs [SAEs]), AEs of special interest 
(infusion related reaction [IRR]/systemic injection reaction [SIR], delayed hypersensitivity, localised 
injection site reactions [ISRs], infections, and malignancies), clinical laboratory analyses, pregnancy 
testing, local site pain using the 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and signs and symptoms of 
tuberculosis (TB).

Page 53/157
Sample size
The primary endpoint was the Ctrough,week22 (pre-dose level at Week 22). A sample size of 104 patients 
(52 patients each in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms) provided 90% power to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV based on the 95% one-sided CI for the 
geometric mean ratio of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV in Ctrough,week22. In the sample size calculation, non-
inferiority margin of 80%, one-sided alpha level 5%, expected ratio of 1.3, and CV of 100% were 
assumed. Considering a 20% drop-out rate, a total of 130 patients (65 patients each in the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms) were required.
A reassessment of sample size accounting for the actual ratio of geometric means and CV was made 
using the results from Part 1. The sample size was not to be decreased from the initial 130 total 
sample size, but could be increased up to 200 patients in case that actual ratio of geometric means 
decreased to 1.18 or actual CV increased up to 140%. The minimum sample size was determined as 
initial 130 total, considering DSMB’s recommendation based upon the review of PK, efficacy, PD, and 
safety data found over the first 30 weeks from Part 1 of the study.
Randomisation
An interactive web response system (IWRS) was used for the randomisation at Week 6. The 
randomisation was stratified by current use of treatment with AZA or 6-MP or MTX (used or not used), 
clinical response at Week 6 (responder or non-responder by CDAI-70 for CD or partial Mayo score for 
UC), body weight at Week 6 (<80 kg or ≥80 kg), and disease (CD or UC). The randomisation numbers 
were blocked, and within each block the same number of patients was allocated to each treatment 
arm. The block size, four, was not revealed.
Initially, per protocol amendment 1, the body weight cut-off was 100 kg, thus the stratification 
principle was changed during the conduct of the trial. 
Blinding (masking)
Blinding was not included in Part 2 of the study, because it was an open-label study.
Statistical methods
The principles of the statistical analyses were described in the protocol amendment 1 (17Jan2017), 
which was issued before first patient first visit. The details were further described in SAP (final version 
15Jan2020). 
There were six analysis populations: intent-to-treat (ITT), all-randomized, PK, PD, efficacy, and safety 
populations. Analysis of the ITT population and all-randomized population was performed according to 
the treatment they were randomized to at Week 6. The other populations were analysed according to 
actual treatment arm. There was no difference in actual and randomised treatments.
The ITT population consisted of all enrolled patients. The all-randomized population consisted of all 
randomly assigned patients at Week 6, regardless of whether or not any study drug dosing was 
completed.
The PK population consisted of the all-randomized population who received at least one full dose of 
study drug at Week 6 or thereafter and who had at least one PK concentration result after Week 6 
treatment. The primary PK endpoint of the Ctrough,week22 (pre-dose level at Week 22) was analysed in 
patients who received all doses (full) of study drug up to Week 22 (prior to Week 22) in the PK

Page 54/157
population. A patient was considered as receiving full dose if the actual administered dose (mg) of the 
patient was greater than or equal to 95% of prescribed dose (mg).
The PD population consisted of the all-randomized population who received at least one full dose of 
study drug at Week 6 or thereafter and who had at least one PD result (FC or CRP) after Week 6 
treatment.
The efficacy population consisted of the all-randomized population who received at least one full dose 
of study drug at Week 6 or thereafter and who had at least one efficacy evaluation (in respective 
indication) result after Week 6 treatment.
The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose (full or partial) of study 
drug at Week 6 or thereafter.
The primary PK endpoint, Ctrough,week22 (pre-dose level at Week 22) was analysed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) as described in section 2.3.2. 
All other endpoints were summarized in terms of descriptive statistics. Numerical endpoints were 
reported as observed, thus, no imputation was applied. For response type of endpoints, the percentage 
of responders was calculated using the number of subjects in the specific analysis population as 
denominator.

136 patients were enrolled in the study and were treated in the dose-loading phase. 131 patients 
initiated the maintenance phase at Week 6 (66 and 65 patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arms, respectively). Of the patients initiating the maintenance phase 53 were CD patients 
and 78 were UC patients. The majority of patients in each treatment arm were continuing the study at 
Week 54. During the maintenance phase, 11 [16.7%] patients in the SC 120/240 mg arm and 15

For patients who dropped out for any reason, all study procedures were performed on the day of 
withdrawal (or the day after withdrawal) and all attempts were made to complete all EOS assessments 
at planned time points of the EOS visit.
Recruitment
The study period was 07 May 2018 (first patient’s first study drug administration date) to 16 
September 2019 (last patient’s Week 54 visit). The Week 54 visit date of the last patient was 16 
September 2019 and after further data cleaning, the database was locked on 25 October 2019.

Baseline data in CD patients
In CD patients, the mean (SD) age of patients was 38.4 (15.78) and 35.5 (11.41) years in the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. The proportion of male patients compared 
to the female patients were similar in total (27 [50.9%] male and 26 [49.1%] female patients). 
However, in the SC treatment arm 16/28 patients (57.1%) were male. In the IV treatment arm 11/25 
(44%) were male. The mean weight was 68.93 (16.32) kg.
Baseline CDAI scores were similar in the two treatment arms (296.38 and 294.75 in the SC and IV 
arms, respectively). However, at randomisation, after 6 weeks of identical IV treatment, patients in the 
SC arm had higher CDAI scores. In the SC treatment arm 75% of patients were responders at week 6, 
while 84% of patients in the IV arm were responders. The difference between treatment arms was 
driven mainly by patients weighing ≥ 80kg, i.e. patients who would subsequently receive SC 240 mg. 
These patients had a significantly higher baseline CDAI score than patients with a body weight <80kg 
(320.4 vs. 286.8). Baseline CDAI score for patients in the IV arm with a body weight ≥ 80kg was 
296.7.
Baseline data in UC patients
In UC patients, the mean (SD) age of patients was 37.4 (14.83) and 41.8 (15.06) years in the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. The proportion of male patients were 
slightly higher than the female (44 [56.4%] male and 34 [43.6%] female patients). In the SC arm 
52,6% were male, while 60% were male in the IV arm. The mean weight was 71.93 (15.32) kg.
In the SC treatment arm 73.7% of patients were responders at week 6, while 77.5% of patients in the 
IV arm were responders. Baseline total Mayo scores were similar in the two treatment arms (7.9 and 
8.3 in the SC and IV arms, respectively).
Medical history, prior medication and concomitant treatment 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 58/157
The total number of medical histories at screening was higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm 
(277 and 180 medical histories reported in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, 
respectively). Gastrointestinal disorders were recorded for 45.5% of patients in the SC arm and 35.4% 
on the IV arm. In the SC arm, 12 patients (18.2%) had a recording of anaemia, in the IV arm, 7 
patients (10.8%).
In CD patients, a total of 46 (86.8%) patients had taken at least 1 prior medication. The most 
commonly reported prior medications by drug class were corticosteroids for systemic use (15 [53.6%] 
and 13 [52.0%] patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). During 
maintenance phase, the most commonly reported concomitant medications were corticosteroids for 
systemic use (15 [53.6%] and 16 [64.0%] patients in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively). 
In UC patients, a total of 71 (91.0%) patients had taken at least 1 prior medication. The most 
commonly reported prior medications by drug class were antidiarrheal, intestinal anti-
inflammatory/anti-infective agents (24 [63.2%] and 23 [57.5%] patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 
5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). During maintenance phase, the most commonly reported 
concomitant medications were antidiarrheal, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents (35 
[92.1%] and 38 [95.0%] patients in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively). Corticosteroids for 
systemic use were used by 52.6% and 52.5%of patients prior to study initiation, while they were used 
by 14 (36.8%) and 28 (70%) patients in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively during 
maintenance phase. 
Among CD patients, 50.9% had a concomitant immunosuppressant (AZA or MTX or 
hydroxychloroquine sulfate); 15/28 (53.6%) in the SC arm and 12/25 (48%) in the IV arm. Among UC 
patients, the amount of patients with concomitant immunosuppressant medication (AZA or 
cyclosporine) was 39.7%; SC 14/38 (36.8%) in the SC arm and 17/40 (42.5%) in the IV arm. In 
addition, one patient in the UC group used mercaptopurine, which was classified as an antineoplastic 
agent.
Hence, data on patients treated without concomitant immunosuppressant is still limited (13 CD 
patients and 24 UC patients treated with Remsima SC).

Outcomes and estimation
Efficacy in Patients with Active Crohn’s Disease 
Efficacy was the secondary endpoint of the study, where active CD was assessed by the evaluation of 
CDAI, colonoscopy (SES-CD), and SIBDQ. In addition, CRP and faecal calprotectin were assessed as 
pharmacodynamic parameters.
CDAI
The proportions of CD patients achieving clinical response according to the CDAI-70 and CDAI-100 
criteria in the two treatment arms up to Week 54 are shown in Table 18 and the proportion of 
patients achieving clinical remission are shown in Table 20. Clinical remission was defined as an 
absolute CDAI score < 150 points.

At week 22 the mean response rate was slightly lower in the SC 120/240 arm compared to the IV 
arm. However, by week 30, the rates were similar. In the 120mg arm (the proposed dose) the 
response rate after week 6 was constantly slightly higher or similar compared to the IV arm.  
Table 19 shows that the proportion of patients reaching clinical response was significantly lower 
among patients weighing ≥80 kg than among patients weighing <80 kg in the SC arm. Their response 
rates remained lower compared to <80kg SC patients and compared to average IV patients throughout 
the study.

Figure 22 shows that patients who received 240mg SC treatment (per protocol ≥80kg) have a less 
favourable outcome compared to the combined SC treatment arm. This is explained by the fact that 
these eight patients had poorer baseline CDAI scores than patients in the other groups and they also 
showed a poorer response than other patients in the SC arm and compared to the whole IV arm. 
However, compared to patients in the IV arm with body weight ≥80kg, their response was not worse 
according to actual values of CDAI score (Table 29). Baseline CDAI among SC patients ≥80kg was 
326.71; among IV patients ≥80kg baseline CDAI was 305.86.
Colonoscopy (SES-CD) and SIBDQ
The mean (SD) overall SES-CD scores were similar at baseline and decreased at Week 22 in a similar 
trend between the 2 treatment arms.

The unblinded local and the blinded centralised assessments of SES-CD score resulted in similar 
outcomes. 
The mean scores of Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) were similar between 
the two treatment arms and similar levels of improvement in the quality were observed in both 
treatment arms up to Week 54. 
CRP and FC concentrations
The mean change from baseline in CRP was similar between the 2 treatment arms up to Week 22 with 
slightly greater decrease in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm than the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm at 
Week 30.
Baseline FC levels varied in CD patients but decreased to similar levels in the two treatment arms after 
CT-P13 administration and well maintained up to Week 54.

Efficacy in Patients with Active Ulcerative Colitis
Active UC was assessed by the evaluation of Mayo scoring system, mucosal healing, and SIBDQ. In 
addition, CRP and faecal calprotectin were assessed as pharmacodynamic parameters.
Mayo score
The mean scores for total and partial Mayo scores were similar between the 2 treatment arms at 
baseline. At Week 22, there was a slightly greater improvement in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm 
in terms of both response and remission rates according to both total and partial Mayo scores. After 
switching to CT-P13 SC 120/240 mg at Week 30 in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm, the response and 
remission rates were comparable between the two treatment arms up to Week 54.

The unblinded local and the blinded centralised assessments of mucosal healing resulted in similar 
Mayo score and remission outcomes.
Mucosal healing 
Mucosal healing was assessed by endoscopic subscore of the MSS which evaluated the degree of 
endoscopic rectal inflammation based on a 4-point scale according to flexible proctosigmoidoscopy 
findings. Mucosal healing was defined as an absolute endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1. 
The proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing was higher in the CT-P13 SC 120/ 240 mg arm 
than the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg arm at Week 22. After switching from CT-P13 IV to CT-P13 SC treatment 
at Week 30 in the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg arm, the proportions of patients achieving mucosal healing were 
similar between the two treatment arms at Week 54. Unblinded local and blinded centralised 
endoscopy results are presented in Table 26.

The MAH states that the relatively lower proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing at Week 22 
in the IV treatment arm is a reflection of greater missing rates in the IV arm. The number of patients 
who discontinued from the study prior to Week 22 or missed endoscopy subscore at Week 22 in the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms was 4 (10.5%) and 11 (28.2%) patients, respectively.
The CHMP noted that when calculating only the results for patients who remained in the study and had 
endoscopy scores, the proportion of patients achieving response and mucosal healing was still 
numerically greater among SC treated patients.

Ancillary analyses
Efficacy results after dose escalation
Dose escalation to CT-P13 SC 240 mg every 2 weeks was allowed starting at Week 30 if the patient 
initially responded but then lost response. Among patients who were planned to receive CT-P13 SC 
120 mg on or after Week 30 regardless of the treatment arm, a total of 14 patients (5 CD patients [2 
and 3 from CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC arms, respectively] and 9 UC patients [6 and 3 from CT-P13 IV 
and CT-P13 SC arms, respectively]) received at least one escalated dose.

In all, 14 patients received the escalated dose and 7 of these patients showed some sign of 
improvement, All CD patients had Ctrough concentrations well above the target of 5 μg/mL (range 8.9-
29.6 μg/mL) immediately before loss of response. 
Among UC patients, three patients showed improvement according to Mayo score after dose 
escalation. Three patients discontinued due to signs of disease progression despite the double dose. 
Subgroup analysis by body weight
For subgroup analysis, patients with body weight < 80 kg who were administered CT-P13 SC 120 mg 
for maintenance treatment were divided into tertiles by weight: < 60 kg (first subgroup), 60 kg ≤ 
weight < 67 kg (second subgroup) and 67 kg ≤ weight < 80 kg (third subgroup). In addition to the 
three subgroups above, patients ≥ 80 kg who were administered CT-P13 SC 240 mg for maintenance 
treatment were included as a fourth subgroup for analysis.

improvement in actual values of CDAI score was slightly poorer among patients with body weight 
≥80kg. 
In patients weighing ≥ 80 kg, the proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to CDAI-
70 and CDAI-100 was smaller in the SC arm than in the IV arm. However, this difference was seen 
already at week 6 when treatments were identical, and also remained at week 54 (identical treatments 
from week 30 to week 54) (Table 19).

Note: Weight at Week 6 was used for categorisation of subgroup. Clinical remission according to partial Mayo score was defined as a partial Mayo of 1 point or lower. 
1 Results at Week 6 were obtained following 2 IV infusions in the Dose-Loading Phase. 
CI: Confidence interval, IV: Intravenous, SC: Subcutaneous, UC: Ulcerative colitis
All CD subjects had moderate disease severity (CDAI score between 220 and 450 points) and all but 3 UC patients had moderate disease severity (6-10 
points on Mayo score). Hence, no subgroup analysis for disease severity was conducted.

Note: A patient was defined as having a CDAI-70 response if there was a decrease in CDAI score of ≥ 70 points from the baseline value. A patient 
was defined as having a CDAI-100 response if there was a decrease in CDAI score of ≥ 100 points from the baseline value. The baseline value was 
considered to be the last non-missing value before the first administration. 
1 Results at Week 6 were obtained following 2 IV infusions in the Dose-Loading Phase. 
2 Patients from Part 1 were included. The patients administered CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg up to Week 54. 3 Patients from Part 2 were included. The 
patients administered CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg up to Week 22. From Week 30, the patients were switched to CT-P13 SC 120 or 240 mg based on their 
weight at Week 30. Further doses of CT-P13 SC every 2 weeks were given up to Week 54.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
The efficacy of infliximab IV is well established. As a biosimilar to Remicade IV, Remsima IV is 
approved in adult patients for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative 
colitis (UC), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and psoriasis (Ps). Following a line 
extension application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062), the subcutaneous formulation Remsima SC was 
approved for treatment of RA. Notably, the originator Remicade does not have a SC-formulation. With 
this variation, the MAH has presented data to support an indication extension to cover all the 
indications approved for Remsima IV (and Remicade IV). The recommended dose is 120 mg 
administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W) for all patients in all indications.
The efficacy and dose finding data supporting the proposed extension of indications are from Study CT-
P13 1.6 Parts 1/2 (CD and UC patients) with pivotal data coming from Study CT-P13 3.5 Parts 1/2 (RA 
patients). Studies 3.5 Parts 1/2 and 1.6 Part 1 have been assessed within the initial line extension 
application. Efficacy data from Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, as well as the basis for extrapolation of 
efficacy and dosing to indications not studied, are discussed in more detail below.
Design and conduct of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2
Study design
Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, study designed to 
demonstrate that CT-P13 SC was non-inferior to CT-P13 IV, in terms of PK in patients with active 
Crohn’s disease (CD) or active ulcerative colitis (UC) up to Week 54. Efficacy endpoints were evaluated 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 81/157
as supportive data. The open label design is acceptable, since the primary endpoint (Ctrough) is not 
expected to be subject to bias due to lack of blinding. The study design was discussed and agreed with 
the CHMP through Scientific Advice (SA).
Participants
The study population (as captured by the inclusion/exclusion criteria) is overall appropriate for the 
study purpose and the studied indications CD and UC. In addition to the subjective rating scales (CDAI 
for CD patients and total Mayo score for UC patients), current disease activity was ensured by 
objective measures, such as CRP and endoscopic findings. The exclusion criteria are in line with 
contraindications and warnings in the current SmPC. 
CD patients with severe disease activity or fistulating CD were not included in the study. Such patients 
are expected to have a high inflammatory burden and possibly an accelerated drug clearance. 
However, the route of administration is not expected to affect the level of influence of inflammatory 
burden on PK and, therefore, the exclusion of patients with severe disease activity is acceptable. 
Patients with a BMI>35 were excluded from this study and have not been included in any of the other 
clinical studies in the development of Remsima SC. Thus, drug exposure and efficacy among the 
heaviest patients is based on simulations. 
Among CD patients, 8 patients in the SC arm and 7 in IV arm had a body weight ≥80kg at week 6. 
Among UC patients, 10 and 13 patients in the SC and IV arms, respectively had a body weight ≥80kg.
Treatments
CT-P13 120 mg by SC injection every 2 weeks after loading doses, was compared to CT-P13 5mg/kg 
every 8 weeks during 54 weeks of treatment. The 54 week duration is sufficient to determine efficacy 
and immunogenicity during treatment. There was only a 2 weeks off-dose period, prior to the EOS 
visit. This means that no ADA samples were taken post immunosuppression. This is further discussed 
in section 2.5.1.
The dose chosen for the investigational drug was based on the Population PK and PK-PD modelling 
data from the original Remsima IV Studies (CT-P13 1.1, CT-P13 1.4, CT-P13 3.1, and CT-P13 3.4) and 
the studies from the Remsima SC programme in healthy volunteers (Study CT-P13 1.5), RA patients 
(CT-P13 3.5 [Part 1 up to Week 30]) and CD patients (CT-P13 1.6 [Part 1 up to Week 30]). The 
method of dose selection was agreed in CHMP SA. The dosing of the comparator, Remsima IV, was in 
line with the SmPC for all intended indications.
All stratification parameters are factors, which may affect drug concentration. Hence, the stratification 
scheme is adequate.
Objectives and endpoints
The mode of action in all proposed indications is the same, namely neutralisation of TNFα (soluble 
and/or membrane bound). However, due to differences between target populations in age, disease 
specific variation in amount of target molecule (TNFα), inflammatory burden, comorbidities and 
concomitant medication, there may be differences between the two formulations regarding PK and 
immunogenicity, which might shift the benefit/risk. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to show 
that Remsima SC has a similar PK, efficacy and safety profile, including immunogenicity, as Remsima 
IV in also IBD patients, though it has already been shown in RA.
The primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of Ctrough at week 22 with Remsima SC compared 
to Remsima IV in CD and UC patients was agreed by CHMP through scientific advice (EMA - Follow-up 
Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/3220/1/FU/1/2016/II; 15 Sep 2016)). Efficacy of infliximab has 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 82/157
previously been shown to correlate with Ctrough in IBD patients. Although the exact target concentration 
for infliximab in IBD is unknown, the current evidence suggests that targeting a concentration greater 
than 5 μg/mL is appropriate when aiming at both symptomatic and endoscopic response. Of note, this 
target is often not reached when treating patients with IV infliximab with the currently approved 
dosing.
The dose selection for this study was based on achieving a Ctrough, which exceeded a target threshold of 
5 μg/mL and an AUC8weeks,ss that aligned as closely as possible to that achieved following 5 mg/kg of 
Remsima IV. Since IV administration leads to high Cmax and low Ctrough, compared to SC administration, 
aligning the AUC will inevitably lead to higher Ctrough concentrations following SC administration. An 
inferior Ctrough could have been achieved only if the AUC had been severely misaligned. While, a non-
inferior Ctrough can ensure comparable efficacy, it is not helpful in determining comparability of safety. 
Efficacy was assessed in CD patients by CDAI score and endoscopic response. The most recent EMA 
Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease 
(CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 2, revised June 2018) points out that both reliability and validity of the 
Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) has been questioned. However, this index has previously been 
used extensively in clinical trials in CD and it is used here to measure secondary endpoints in a 
descriptive manner, which is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Colonoscopy investigation was to be conducted locally but evaluated and adjudicated centrally, which 
should have minimised the variability in assessment. The scale used to evaluate the grade of mucosal 
inflammation is validated and extensively used (SES-CD). 
Assessment of efficacy in UC patients using Mayo score is in line with the EMA Guideline on the 
development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. According to this 
guideline, the total Mayo score including physician’s global assessment is not of primary interest and 
the partial Mayo score is to be preferred.
Sample size and statistical methods
The sample size was targeted to provide sufficient power to demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of 
Ctrough at week 22 (the primary objective of this trial). Randomisation was stratified and that was taken 
into account in the primary analysis, though the stratification cut-off value for weight was changed 
from 100kg to 80kg during the conduct of the trial (amendment 2, 09Jan2018). This amendment is in 
line with the amended dosing scheme, where the cut-off for increased dose was set at 80kg based on 
results from dose finding studies and was done prior to inclusion of first patient. This is therefore found 
acceptable to the CHMP.
The definition of the analysis populations follows conventions. The primary analysis was conducted in a 
subset of the PK population as full dose until Week 22 was required for a subject to be included in the 
analysis, which is acceptable in this setting where the primary endpoint is PK endpoint.
In the interpretation of the efficacy results, it should be taken into account that ‘as observed’ excludes 
subjects with incomplete data, thus assumes that the outcome of the discontinued subject would follow 
the response pattern of those who are compliant. This affects interpretation of the actual values of 
CDAI and Mayo scores. At the same time, the non-responder imputation has been applied to response-
type of outcomes, and this method treats incomplete data more conservatively. In general, the applied 
statistical methods are acceptable to the CHMP for this type of trial.
Baseline data
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 83/157
Forty-five patients of 195 screened (23%) did not meet the inclusion criteria. However, the percentage 
is relatively small and the studied population is considered reasonably representative of a real life 
population of patients with IBD.
The proportions of patients who discontinued the study during the maintenance phase were 16.7% and 
23.1% in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. In this type of long-term 
maintenance study the discontinuation rate is acceptable to the CHMP. The reasons for discontinuation 
were broadly similar between the treatment arms and between CD and UC patients and discontinuation 
was more common in the IV arm, if anything, which supports non-inferiority of Remsima SC. Primary 
reasons for discontinuation during the maintenance phase was development of signs of disease 
progression 4 (6.1%) in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm and 5 (7.7%) in the IV treatment arm. In 
addition, patients were also withdrawn by investigator’s decision. Assessment of individual patient data 
revealed that all patients who were classified as “withdrawn from the study by investigator’s decision” 
were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy or insufficient efficacy. All patients who discontinued were 
included in the safety and efficacy analyses and were classified as non-responders. Based on the 
reasons for discontinuation, this classification is endorsed by CHMP.  
The baseline characteristics and prior treatment histories are representative for the studied diseases. 
The baseline demographics were similar between the SC and IV study groups. The use of concomitant 
immunomodulatory medication (AZA or MTX or hydroxychloroquine sulfate, cyclosporine and 
corticosteroids), was evenly distributed between treatment arms in both patient groups.
However, some differences in baseline characteristics were found. The total number of medical 
histories at screening was higher in the SC treatment arm (277 and 180 medical histories reported in 
the SC and IV 5 arms, respectively). The difference between treatment arms in terms of medical 
history at screening is mainly driven by the System Organ Classes (SOC) Gastrointestinal disorders 
and Blood and lymphatic system disorders. Patients in the SC arm also had more recordings of 
Infections and infestations at baseline. (See discussion regarding differences in safety outcome in 
section 2.5.1.)
In spite of identical induction phases and similar baseline CDAI scores, there was a slightly lower 
response rate at week 6 among CD patients in the SC arm compared to the IV arm. The initial weaker 
response in the SC arm was driven by the group of patients who received 240mg SC, i.e. patients with 
a body weight ≥80kg. These patients had a significantly higher baseline CDAI score than patients with 
a body weight <80kg (320.4 vs. 286.8 in SC treated patients; among IV patients ≥80kg baseline CDAI 
was 296.7). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Efficacy in Patients with Active Crohn’s Disease 
At baseline both treatment arms had similar CDAI scores (301 and 303 in SC 120/240 mg and IV 
5mg/kg treatment arms respectively). Both treatment arms improved during the identical induction 
phase (weeks 0-6), but the improvement was slightly greater in the IV arm at week 6 (-129 and -151 
in SC and IV treatment arms respectively). By week 22, both treatment arms had similar actual CDAI 
scores and equal improvement from baseline. Clinical remission was reached by 16 (57.1%)and 15 
(60.0%) of patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5mg/kg treatment arms respectively by week 22; 
the corresponding figure for those receiving 120mg (proposed dose) was 13/20 (65%).
Overall, the mean CDAI score decreased steadily over time in both treatment arms over the whole 
treatment period of 54 weeks in a comparable manner. However, there were dropouts along the way 
and no imputation of missing values was done for continuous variables. Since the majority of 
discontinuations were due to lack of effect or progression of disease, the mean CDAI score only 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 84/157
represents the mean for those patients who were well enough not to terminate the study. Therefore, 
an ever decreasing mean value of absolute CDAI score cannot be interpreted as an ongoing clinical 
improvement. In fact, when looking at response rates, it seems that response increases up until week 
22 in both treatment arms, where after a plateau is reached. 
In the initial submission it was noticed that some patients had negative CDAI total scores. A common 
statement in scholarly articles on the CDAI score is that CDAI score should range from 0-600. In the 
original publication by Best et al. it is stated that “Each variable is coded in such a way that the 
expected value in a normal individual is zero, and progressively larger positive values are expected to 
reflect progressively greater activity of Crohn's disease.” It does not follow from this statement that 
values less than zero reflect a better outcome, as zero is defined as normal.  For example, negative 
values for the hematocrit component reflect a high haematocrit, implying dehydration, and cannot be 
interpreted as a positive sign in CD. The weight component of the CDAI is intended to detect weight 
loss and thus gives higher scores if the patient is underweight. While weight gain can be a sign of 
improvement in a seriously ill CD patient, a negative score in the weight component only represents 
overweight. Therefore, the inclusion of negative CDAI scores is not clinically justified and it is skewing 
the results toward a more positive outcome. Five patients in the SC group had negative scores and 
only one in the IV group. Thus, initially a potential for bias in the results was recognised. Upon 
request, the MAH adjusted all individual CDAI subscores to a minimum of zero and recalculated the 
relevant efficacy results.  After adjustment of the CDAI scores, the mean actual CDAI scores, the 
CDAI-70 and CDAI-100 response rates and the remission rates were almost unchanged compared to 
the original results.
Colonoscopy was not performed on all patients. It is stated in the CSR that SES-CD score was assessed 
only in patients who had confirmed mucosal abnormalities from previous assessment. This approach is 
by design only able to detect a potential improvement while a disease progression in patients with no 
mucosal abnormality at baseline would go undetected. However, upon request, the MAH provided 
convincing evidence that the colonoscopy approach to exclude patients without confirmed mucosal 
abnormalities did not result in skewed efficacy results.
Based on the provided data, CT-P13 SC 120/240 mg is non-inferior to CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg in terms of 
proportions of CD patients achieving clinical remission and endoscopic remission according to CDAI 
score (<150) and SES-CD score. In terms of CRP, the SC treatment arm achieved slightly better 
results than the IV arm. All secondary efficacy outcomes are aligned and support non-inferiority of CT-
P13 SC.
Clinical response in the 120/240 arm according to CDAI-70 and CDAI-100 at week 22 did not fully 
support non-inferiority of Remsima SC. This finding seems to be sufficiently explained by the following 
chance finding: In spite of identical induction phases and similar baseline CDAI scores, there was a 
slightly lower response rate at week 6 among CD patients in the SC arm compared to the IV arm. 
Hence, CD patient in the SC arm could have been slower or weaker responders by chance selection.  
However, this did not translate into weaker response rates in the long run. By week 30, also the 
response rate, not only remission rate, was similar between treatment arms.
The initial weaker response in the SC arm was driven by the group of patients who received 240mg 
SC, i.e. patients with a body weight ≥80kg. Their response rates remained lower compared to <80kg 
SC patients and compared to average IV patients throughout the study. Based on these discrepancies 
in baseline data and asymmetrical response according to body weight, it seems that the somewhat 
weaker response in the SC 120/240 mg arm seen at week 22 was a chance finding. 
Patients treated with the sought dose SC 120mg, who had a similar response at randomisation as 
those treated with IV 5mg/kg, showed comparable, or even slightly better, response and remission 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 85/157
rates throughout the study compared to the whole IV arm, at all time points after week 6. However, 
results between these two groups are not fully comparable because the SC 120 arm only contained 
patients with a body weight <80 kg, while the IV arm contained 7 patients ≥80kg. Therefore, the MAH 
was asked to provide subgroup analyses of response and remission results by body weight for the IV 
arm. In patients weighing ≥ 80 kg, the proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to 
CDAI-70 and CDAI-100 was clearely smaller in the SC arm than in the IV arm. However, this 
difference was seen already at week 6 when treatments were identical, and also remained at week 54 
(identical treatments from week 30 to week 54). This indicates that the difference between treatment 
arms in patients weighing ≥ 80 kg is a chance finding and is not related to weaker efficacy of the SC 
formulation in heavy patients.
Pooled Efficacy Analysis of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2 in CD Patients
Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2 shared the same inclusion/ exclusion criteria and the sub-studies 
are similar with regard to background therapy, study design, and assessment of the endpoints. 
However, in Part 2 dosage was weight based, while patients were randomised to different doses in Part 
1. Therefore, interpretation of the pooled results is not straight forward. However, the results of the 
pooled analysis indicate that patients who first received Remsima IV 5mg/kg for 30 weeks and then 
switched to Remsima SC 120/240mg (Part 2) had slightly higher response rates by week 54 than 
patients who continued with the IV dosage (Part 1). The small numbers preclude any definitive 
conclusions.
Efficacy in Patients with Active Ulcerative Colitis
At Week 22, there was a slightly greater improvement in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm in terms 
of both response and remission rates according to both total and partial Mayo scores. 
The MAH states that the relatively lower proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing at Week 22 
in the IV treatment arm is a reflection of greater missing rates in the IV arm. 
The number of patients who discontinued from the study prior to Week 22 or missed endoscopy 
subscore at Week 22 in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms was 4 (10.5%) and 11 
(28.2%) patients, respectively.
If a patient discontinued from the study prior to a visit or missed endoscopy subscore at a visit, the 
patient was considered as not having achieved mucosal healing at that visit. This approach is endorsed 
by CHMP since the major reason for discontinuation was lack of response. 
Based on the provided data, Remsima SC 120/240 mg, as well as the proposed 120mg dose, is non-
inferior to CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg in UC patients in terms of response and remission rates according to 
both total and partial Mayo scores before switching of treatment at week 30 and after switching up to 
week 54. All efficacy outcomes are aligned and support non-inferiority of Remsima SC.
Subgroup analysis
All CD subjects had moderate disease severity (CDAI score between 220 and 450 points) and all but 3 
UC patients had moderate disease severity (6-10 points on Mayo score).  Hence, no subgroup analysis 
for disease severity was conducted. 
In CD patients, there was no consistent trend for superiority or inferiority of either treatment in 
patients weighing <80 kg. In the subgroup of patients weighing ≥ 67 kg but < 80 kg the efficacy of 
Remsima SC was not inferior to that of Remsima IV, (slightly better if anything), despite a somewhat 
lower predicted drug exposure in terms of AUC.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 86/157
In patients weighing ≥ 80 kg, the proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to CDAI-
70 and CDAI-100 was clearely smaller in the SC arm than in the IV arm. However, this difference was 
seen already at week 6 when treatments were identical, and also remained at week 54 (identical 
treatments from week 30 to week 54). This indicates that the difference between treatment arms in 
patients weighing ≥ 80 kg is a chance finding and is not related to weaker efficacy of the SC 
formulation in heavy patients.
In UC patients, the subgroup analyses of clinical response and remission based on Partial Mayo Score 
showed no trends related to body weight in either of the treatment arms. No subgroup analysis was 
performed for efficacy according to use of methotrexate or other concomitant immunosuppressant 
medication. This is acceptable since the efficacy of Remsima SC with methotrexate has been 
established and the efficacy without concomitant immunosuppressant is not expected to be lesser, if 
anything, the exposure is expected to be higher, in this group, due to lower incidence of ADA.
Appropriateness of the proposed dosing
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W was shown to be non-inferior to Remsima IV 3 
mg/kg Q8W in RA patients in terms of efficacy, to give rise to a comparable but slightly higher AUC 
and to give rise to a manifold higher Ctrough compared to Remsima IV 3 mg/kg. When comparing 
Remsima SC 120 mg to Remsima IV 5 mg/kg in study CT-P13 1.6, the observed AUC was 
approximately 1.35-fold higher for dosing regimen 120 mg SC Q2W compared with dosing regimen 5 
mg/kg IV Q8W. Although the predicted AUC over 8 weeks of Remsima SC 120 mg was slightly lower 
for some patients than that of Remsima IV 5 mg/kg, this was not translated into weaker efficacy for 
IBD patients in study CT-P13 1.6. 
In study 1.6 Part 2, patients who received Remsima 120mg had consistently non-inferior and even 
slightly better results than patients in the IV arm. Patients with a body weight above 80kg received 
Remsima SC 240 mg Q2W. Among CD patients in this patient group, results were slightly less 
favourable in the SC arm than in the IV arm. However, this was explained by higher CDAI scores at 
randomisation. Among UC patients, the results were comparable between treatment arms in both 
weight/dose groups. 
Population PK modelling showed that the target Ctrough threshold for efficacy (> 5 μg/mL) would be met 
for even the heaviest weight groups following the 120 mg dosing. Of note, this threshold is often not 
met with the currently approved IV dosing and the chance of meeting the Ctrough threshold for efficacy 
is larger with SC 120 mg dosing than with IV 5mg/kg dosing. Furthermore, PK-PD modelling data 
indicated that CDAI and partial Mayo score were similar between patients treated with Remsima IV 5 
mg/kg and Remsima SC 120 mg and that Remsima SC 120mg was non-inferior even in the heaviest 
patients (up to 150 kg). Ctrough is considered to be the main PK parameter predicting efficacy and the 
Ctrough threshold for efficacy (> 1 μg/mL in RA and > 5 μg/mL in IBD) is supported by literature and 
was approved through SA. 
In addition, in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, there were 3 patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg at Week 6 and 
were assigned to Remsima SC 120 mg cohort. These 3 patients achieved both CDAI-70 and CDAI-100 
responses and clinical remission at Weeks 30 and 54. 
Clinical data from studies 3.5 and 1.6 suggest that efficacy of Remsima SC is non-inferior to Remsima 
IV even if Cmax is clearly lower. Therefore, it can be concluded that Cmax is not predictive of response 
and does not need to be comparable. Based on clinical findings from studies 1.6 and 3.5, on PK and 
PK-PD modelling and on the literature review provided by the MAH, maintaining a Ctrough above > 5 
μg/mL should be enough to ensure efficacy of Remsima SC 120mg in all patients. Hence, it is not 
considered necessary to increase the dose of Remsima SC to 240mg for patients ≥80kg.

Efficacy results after dose escalation in study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2
Five patients with CD and 9 patients with UC who were planned to receive CT-P13 SC 120 mg were 
administered an escalated dose of 240mg. 
One CD patient and 3 UC patients were in the IV group and received the escalated dose already at 
week 30. Therefore, the improvement in drug concentration and/or efficacy seen in these patients 
cannot be attributed solely to the escalated dose as the switch from IV to SC might have had an equal 
impact due to higher drug concentrations. Data from these patients is relevant only when evaluating 
the safety of an escalated dose.
Among the remaining 4 CD patients, three achieved higher concentrations and concomitantly lower 
CDAI scores after dose increase, while one patient, achieved better CDAI score after dose escalation 
without an increase in drug concentration. All of these patients had Ctrough concentrations well above 
the target of 5 μg/mL (range 8.9-29.6 μg/mL) immediately before loss of response. Hence, the loss of 
response was not driven by low concentrations. 
Among UC patients, three patients showed improvement according to Mayo score after dose 
escalation. Three patients discontinued due to signs of disease progression, despite the double dose. 
In all, 14 patients (n=5 CD, n=9 UC) received the escalated dose and 7 of these patients showed some 
sign of improvement, although the evidence for causality between improvement and dose increase is 
lacking. Moreover, the follow-up time was very limited and, therefore, the duration of the renewed 
response among patients who once lost response is very uncertain and so is the long term safety of 
such high doses. 
Notably, for Remsima IV (and Remicade IV) it is stated in the SmPC that the dose could be increased 
to 7.5 mg/kg every 8 weeks in RA, or to 10mg/kg in Crohn’s disease in those who initially responded 
but lost response. 89% in CD and 57% in fistulising CD responded to this dose increase. In the SmPC 
of Remicade/Remsima IV there is no possibility to increase the dose in other indications, including UC. 
The MAH applied initially for this dose increase not only for CD, but also for UC.
Overall, CHMP considered that there is not enough evidence to support a recommendation on dose 
escalation from CS-P13 SC 120mg to 240mg. Additional efficacy and sufficient safety of 240mg SC, 
especially for patients weighing <80 kg, have not been confirmed. 
The MAH therefore withdrew the initial proposal for increased dosing from 120mg to 240mg in CD and 
UC.
Extrapolation of efficacy to patients with AS, PsA and Ps
Point for justification of extrapolation of efficacy and proposed dosing made by the MAH
-

-
-
In IBD: Ctrough threshold of 5 µg/mL is associated with clinical improvement (Ward et al., 2017; 
Adedokun et al., 2014; Cornillie et al., 2014; Gonczi et al., 2016)
The  trough  levels  for  infliximab  in  psoriasis  patients  were  positively  associated  with  clinical 
response (Torii et al., 2012; Reich et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2012)
A Ctrough target of 3-7 μg/mL has also been reported for AS (De Vries et al., 2007), which aligns 
with CELLTRION data from Study CT-P13 1.1 in AS patients
It is also interesting to note that Brandse et al. (2017) reported, following studying sera from 
332 patients with IBD (253 Crohn's disease and 79 ulcerative colitis), that insufficient exposure 
below an infliximab plasma level of 3 μg/mL increased the risk of anti-infliximab antibodies by 
4-fold. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 88/157
-
In view of the fact that the same dose is recommended for AS, PsA and Ps as for IBD, and in 
view of the data reported above, a Ctrough threshold of 5 ug/mL should be achieved and should 
be adequate for these indications as well 
-
As  like  RA,  the  mode  of  action  in  AS,  PsA  and  Ps  involves  neutralization  of  soluble  TNFα  and 
the  dose  correlates  with  that  for  IBD  –  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  a  dose  of  120  mg 
should ensure a Ctrough > 5 ug/mL which should ensure therapeutic effect in these indications.
Justification based on literature and previous Celltrion studies as summarised by the MAH
The CHMP concluded in scientific advice that clinical studies with Remsima SC would not be required in 
patients with AS, PsA and Ps to gain approval for SC formulation for all adult indications currently 
approved for IV formulation, if an appropriate review on association of PK parameters and clinical 
efficacy and safety in these three indications supports the posology. The review is summarized below.
Pharmacodynamic perspective: The efficacy of infliximab resides in its ability to generally modulate the 
immune system via binding of soluble TNFα, which is the predominant or sole mechanism of action in 
RA, AS, PsA and Ps while in the case of CD and UC binding to transmembrane TNFα is also important. 
The MAH considers it reasonable from the pharmacodynamic perspective to apply a Ctrough threshold 
that is expected to provide optimal efficacy in both RA and IBD indications for AS, PsA and Ps, in which 
the mechanism of action is similar to RA and approved IV dose similar to IBD, i.e. 5 mg/kg Q8W.
Previous studies conducted by the MAH: Study CT-P13 1.1 was a randomized, double-blind, 
multicenter, multiple-dose, two-arm, parallel-group, efficacy, PK and safety study. Patients with AS 
(n=249) were treated with Remsima IV 5 mg/kg or Remicade IV 5 mg/kg. Subgroup analysis showed 
a clear trend in clinical response that correlated with Ctrough levels: The median Ctrough in the responders 
at Week 30 were 3.79 μg/mL and 3.49 μg/mL in the Remsima and Remicade treatment groups, 
respectively, whereas the median Ctrough in the non-responders at Week 30 were 1.17 μg/mL and 1.45 
μg/mL, respectively. The subgroup analysis by Ctrough quartile also demonstrated the correlation 
between clinical response and Ctrough. 
Published scientific literature: As summarised in Table 35, trough levels for infliximab in AS, PsA and 
Ps patients have been positively associated with clinical response, although variability in the Ctrough 
level associated with response is noted.

N/A
Passot et al (2016) investigated the influence of the underlying disease on infliximab PK parameters 
using a retrospective analysis of Ctrough observations collected routinely at the University Hospital of 
Tours, France. Patients in whom ADA was detected during the follow-up were excluded from the 
analysis. Observations from 218 patients (91 with AS, 63 with CD, 16 with UC, 18 with RA (9 of whom 
co-treated with MTX), and 30 with PsA) were available. A one-compartment population PK model with 
first-order elimination rate described satisfactorily the observed data. The estimated PK parameters 
were similar for AS and PsA patients. Diagnosis of RA, CD, and UC was covariate on clearance with 
estimate 0.392, 0.384 and 0.472, respectively, i.e. clearance was increased compared with patients 
with AS and PsA. CD and UC were also covariates on volume of distribution with estimate 0.399 and 
0.417. Clinical efficacy and safety were not investigated in the study.
The CHMP agreed with the analysis of study CT-P13 1.1 and the published literature indicating that 
infliximab trough concentrations are associated with clinical response in AS, PsA and Ps. Variability was 
observed in the mean or median Ctrough in responders. This can be attributed to differences between 
patient populations (including baseline disease severity) and the outcome measure (e.g. PASI 90 vs 
PASI 75). In addition, older bioanalytical methods might not provide identical results compared with the 
most recent methods. In summary, it is difficult to estimate a specific target Ctrough, but an average 
Ctrough of approximately 5 µg/mL in patients with AS, PsA and Ps seems likely to be associated with 
clinical efficacy. 
Passot et al. (2016) reported similar CL in patients with AS and PsA but higher CL in patients with RA. 
The authors suggested that this might be caused by higher TNF burden in RA patients. In patients with 
CD and UC both CL and V were higher than in AS (and PsA) patients. As both CL and V increased, the 
elimination half-life did not change markedly. A potential explanation for these results might be loss of 
infliximab in stools of patients with severe IBD (Brandse et al., 2015). Unlike Passot et al., results of the 
MAH’s 2nd population PK analysis indicated similar clearance and volume parameter estimates for 
healthy volunteers and subjects with RA, AS, CD and UC. Differences between disease severity and the 
amount of post-dose PK samples may at least partly explain the differing results. If infliximab clearance 
in AS and PsA patients is lower than in CD and UC patients, exposure to infliximab would be increased.  
With the proposed posology, the mean Ctrough levels observed in both RA patients (study CT-P13 3.5 Part 
2) and IBD patients (study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2) are well above the target levels in all weight 
bands. Based on the above, similar dosing in As and PsA as in IBD should give rise to similar or possibly 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 90/157
even slightly greater exposure.
Because it is known that the IV dose of 5mg/kg is efficacious in the sought indications, and Ctrough has 
been shown to remain clearly higher with the 120mg SC dosing, even in patients without CIM and with 
positive NAb status, the CHMP agreed that it is expected that the proposed posology for the indications 
AS, PsA and Ps would results in a similar effect.
For discussion on extrapolation of safety and immunogenicity, see section 2.5 and the Benefit-Risk 
section.
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
It is known that the IV infliximab dose of 5mg/kg is efficacious in the RA/ IBD/ AS/ PsA/ Ps-indications. 
It is also known that Ctrough-levels above the threshold of 3-5 ug/mL correlate with efficacy in these 
indications. Ctrough was shown to remain clearly higher than 5 ug/mL with the 120mg SC infliximab 
dosing in patients with RA (in the earlier line extension) and now in IBD, even in patients without CIM 
and with positive Nab status and also in the heaviest patients. Further, efficacy of SC infliximab was 
shown to be non-inferior to that of IV infliximab in RA in a properly powered randomized comparative 
trial. 
The currently provided descriptive clinical efficacy data from a small, randomized, open label, mainly 
PK-study supports that Remsima SC 120mg is clinically non-inferior to Remsima IV 5mg/kg also in CD 
and UC patients. There is no clinical data in AS/ PsA/ Ps-patients treated with SC-infliximab. However, 
based on the above, it is expected that the proposed posology for AS, PsA, AS would result in similar 
Ctrough levels and hence similar clinical effect as seen with IV-infliximab.
2.5.  Clinical safety
Introduction
In all, safety data for Remsima SC have been collected in four clinical studies, consisting the overall 
clinical development programme for Remsima SC: 




Study CT-P13 1.5: Phase I, open-label, dose-escalating, single-dose study in which 38 healthy 
subjects were treated with CT-P13 IV or CT-P13 SC
Study  CT-P13  1.9:  Phase  I,  open-label,  single-dose  PK  and  safety  study  in  which  215  healthy 
subjects were treated with CT-P13 SC via auto-injector (AI) or CT-P13 SC via pre-filled syringe 
(PFS)
Study  CT-P13  3.5  Parts  1  and  2:  Phase  I/III,  double-blind,  randomised,  multi-dose,  parallel-
group  study  in  which  391  patients  with  RA  (48  patients  in  Part  1  and  343  patients  in  Part  2) 
were treated with CT-P13 IV or CT-P13 SC
Study  CT-P13  1.6  Parts  1  and  2:  Phase  I,  open-label,  randomised,  multi-dose,  parallel-group 
study  in  which  175  patients  with  active  Crohn’s  disease  or  active  ulcerative  colitis  (CD  or  UC)  
(44 patients with CD in Part 1 and 131 patients with CD or UC in Part 2) were treated with CT-
P13 IV or CT-P13 SC.
The complete safety data for studies CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 1.9, CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 and Study 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 have been assessed in the line extension application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062).
In the current application, new data was submitted, where clinical safety of Remsima SC was 
compared with Remsima IV, in subjects with CD and UC in study CT-P13 1.6. Part 2. Further details on 
the design and conduct of this study are found in the Clinical Efficacy-section of this AR.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 91/157
Safety of Remsima SC was not studied in AS, Ps and PsA, which is in accordance with the CHMP 
scientific advice. Extrapolation of safety to these indications is discussed in the Extrapolation Section of 
this AR.
Patient exposure
The originator infliximab, Remicade IV, has been approved in the EU since 1999. The safety profile of 
infliximab has been well characterised by more than 20 years of clinical use. Remsima IV was 
developed as an infliximab biosimilar and was approved by the EMA in September 2013. According to 
information provided by the MAH, to date Remsima IV has been approved in 80 countries, and 
launched in 60 countries worldwide. Thus, the overall total cumulative exposure with infliximab IV, 
including post-marketing exposure, is significant.
In all 819 subjects (391 RA patients, 97 CD patients, 78 UC patients and 253 healthy subjects) were 
exposed to at least one dose of CT-P13 IV or SC across four controlled clinical studies. 751 subjects 
(363 RA patients, 79 CD patients, 74 UC patients and 235 healthy subjects) have received at least one 
dose of CT-P13 SC, including those who switched to CT-P13 SC treatment at Week 30 (160 RA patients 
from Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 and 20 CD and 36 UC patients from Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2). Overall, 
654 subjects (221 HVs, 340 RA, 44 CD and 49 UC patients) received at least one dose of 120 mg of 
CT-P13 SC (Table 36). 
In the study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 a total of 136 patients were enrolled and 131 patients were randomly 
assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms at Week 6; the safety population consisting of 66 (28 CD and 38 
UC) patients in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm and 65 (25 CD and 40 UC) patients in the IV 5 
mg/kg treatment arm). From Week 6 to Week 54, 249 patients overall (172 RA, 44 CD and 33 UC 
patients) received CT-P13 SC and among them, 201 patients (155 RA, 24 CD and 22 UC patients) 
received 120 mg of CT-P13 SC.
The duration of the study for Part 2 was overall up to 62 weeks, which included screening (up to 6 
weeks) and the last dose at 54 weeks plus the following 2 weeks off-dose period.
No paediatric indications are proposed for CT-P13 SC in this application and no paediatric data is 
submitted.

Exposure by subject in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2
In the dose-loading phase, all randomized patients received two infusions of CT-P13 IV. The mean 
(SD) total administered doses were similar across the treatment arms (696.3 [141.38] and 724.3 
[164.27] mg in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
The MAH has proposed a fixed maintenance dose 120 mg SC q2w. In the maintenance phase, the 
mean (SD) total administered dose was 3541.8 (1511.20) and 2818.0 (1292.90) mg in the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively.

treatment arms, respectively, indicating that the majority of patients nearly completed the treatment 
up to and including Week 54.

All patients who were ongoing with the study at Week 30 in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm switched to 
receive either 120 or 240 mg of CT-P13 SC treatment based on their body weight at Week 30. Among 
patients who were planned to receive SC 120 mg on or after Week 30, the number of patients with at 
least 1 escalated dose was similar between the 2 treatment arms (6/44 [13.6%] and 8/38 [21.1%] 
patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
In CD patients, the mean (SD) total administered dose in the dose-loading phase were similar across 
the two treatment arms (693.3 [130.46] and 707.9 [193.05] mg in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 
mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). In the maintenance phase, the mean (SD) total administered 
dose was 3407.1 (1410.57) and 2630.1 (1435.03) mg in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arms, respectively. The majority of the patients had completed the treatment up to and 
including Week 54.
In UC patients, the mean (SD) total administered dose in the dose-loading phase were similar across 
the two treatment arms (698.5 [150.62] and 734.6 [145.13] mg in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 
mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). In the maintenance phase, the mean (SD) total administered 
dose was 3641.1 (1592.54) and 2935.5 (1199.59) mg in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arms, respectively. The majority of the patients had completed the treatment up to and 
including Week 54.
Adverse events
The safety assessments of Remsima SC included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse 
events (SAEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse 
events (TESAEs) and deaths; vital signs measurements (including blood pressure, heart rate, 
respiratory rate [RR] and body temperature); 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); physical examination; 
clinical laboratory tests (including liver function tests, Hepatitis B, C and HIV screening); recording 
concomitant medications, monitoring for signs and symptoms of TB, chest x-ray and interferon-γ 
release assay (IGRA); and pregnancy tests. The immunogenicity of CT-P13 was assessed by measuring 
anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralising antibodies (NAb) at pre-defined endpoints. Local site pain 
was measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
The following events were monitored as adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in the Remsima SC 
studies: Administration-related reactions (ARR), which included infusion-related reactions (IRRs), 
Systemic injection reactions (SIR) and delayed hypersensitivity reactions (DEL) and localised injection 
site reactions (ISR), intended to capture local injection site reactions; as well as infections (including 
TB), and malignancies. 
In cases of delayed hypersensitivity, which occurred after 24 hours of study drug administration, 
including serum sickness-like reactions (myalgia with fever or rash, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, skin 
eruption, or edema), the following assessments were additionally performed to determine serum 
sickness during the study period: immunogenicity, clinical laboratory analyses, complement (C3, C4) 
and total hemolytic complement.  Patient overall satisfaction were assessed by using 100-mm VAS as 
a tertiary endpoint.
Treatment Period
TEAEs during the treatment period (including dose-loading phase and a maintenance phase) are not 
presented here in detail for brevity. Overall 75.8% and 64.6% of patients in the SC and IV groups had 
at least one TEAE; 9.1% and 10.8% had at least one TESAE; 22.7% and 4.6% had localised ISR; and 
36.4% and 30.8% had an infection.
TEAEs during the maintenance period from week 6 to less than week 30 are not presented here in 
detail for brevity (for data see section Analysis across studies). Overall 57.6% and 49.2% of patients 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

in the SC and IV groups had at least 1 TEAE; 3.0% and 6.2% had at least one TESAE; 16.7% and 
1.5% had localised ISR; and 16.7% and 16.9% had an infection, respectively, with, overall, no 
unexpected findings or apparent differences or clear trends between the treatment arms, excluding the 
higher incidence of localised ISR in the SC arm, also seen in the entire maintenance phase of the study 
and in the pivotal RA study.

In CD patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE during the maintenance 
phase was higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm (23 [82.1%] and 14 [56.0%] patients for the 
SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively); the difference in the incidence of 
TEAEs between the 2 treatment arms could be attributed to the higher proportion of patients who 
experienced at least 1 TEAE classified as gastrointestinal disorders in the SC 120/240 mg treatment 
arm. However, the proportion of the patients with the medical history of gastrointestinal disorders was 
higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm at baseline as well.
In UC patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE during the maintenance 
phase was similar between the 2 treatment arms (26 [68.4%] and 24 [60.0%] patients for the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).

30 were summarized.1. From MedDRA, Version 20.1. 2. Preferred term reported as “injection site reaction”. 
In CD patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE on or after Week 30 was 
higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm (14 [50.0%] and 8 [32.0%] patients for the SC 120/240

proportion of the patients with the medical history of gastrointestinal disorders was higher in the SC 
120/240 mg treatment arm at baseline as well.
In UC patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE on or after Week 30 was 
slightly higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm (17 [44.7%] and 13 [32.5%] patients for the SC 
120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Considered by the Investigator to be Related to the 
Study Drug Treatment Period
Maintenance Phase
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug during the maintenance phase was slightly higher in SC 120/240 mg treatment 
arm (28 [42.4%] and 20 [30.8%] patients for the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, 
respectively). 
The most frequently reported related TEAE was localised ISR (14 [21.2%] patients) in the SC 120/240 
mg treatment arm, an expected trend based on the route of administration; and for patients in the IV 
5 mg/kg treatment arm, localised ISR and rash, but reported in only 3 (4.6%) patients each.
On or after Week 30
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug on or after Week 30 was similar between the 2 treatment arms after switching to 
SC 120/240 mg in IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm at Week 30 (13 [19.7%] and 11 [16.9%] patients for 
the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
The most frequently reported TEAE considered by the investigator to be related to study drug on or 
after Week 30 was localised ISR (7 [10.6%] patients) in the SC treatment arm; and localised ISR (2 
[3.1%] patients) and neutropenia (2 [3.1%] patients) in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Intensity
Maintenance Phase
The majority of TEAEs reported during the maintenance phase were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in intensity.
The number of patients who experienced at least 1 grade 3 TEAE considered by the investigator to be 
related to the study drug was 8 (6.1%) patients (2 [3.0%] and 6 [9.2%] patients in the SC 120/240 
mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
Three grade 4 TEAEs during the maintenance phase were reported for 3 (2.3%) patients (2 [3.0%] 
and 1 [1.5%] patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). Of these, 
grade 4 TEAE of neutropenia was reported in 1 patient each the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arms, and grade 4 TEAE of appendicitis was reported in 1 patient the SC 120/240 mg 
treatment arm. All grade 4 TEAEs were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study 
drug. Of these, only appendicitis was reported as TESAE.
On or after Week 30
The majority of TEAEs on or after Week 30 were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. In terms of grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs, there were no notable differences between the 2 treatment arms after switching to SC 
120/240 mg in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm at Week 30.
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths
No deaths were reported during the study CT-P13 1.6 part 2.
Maintenance Phase
The number of patients who experienced at least 1 TESAE during the maintenance phase are given in 
Table 43.
In CD patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TESAE during the maintenance 
phase were 3 (10.7%) and 2 (8.0%) patients for the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, 
respectively. In UC patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TESAE during the 
maintenance phase were 2 (5.3%) and 4 (10.0%) patients for the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arms, respectively.
There were no notable differences between the 2 treatment arms in proportion of patients who 
experienced at least 1 TESAE after switching to SC 120/240 mg in IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm at Week 
30.

2Infusion related reaction: PT reported as “administration related reaction” and occurred between start of administration and 24 hours from the end of 
IV infusion.
Infusion Reaction, Systemic Injection Reaction or Delayed Hypersensitivity 
Maintenance Phase
The TEAEs classified as IRR (AEs checked as ARR in the eCRF and occurred between start of 
administration and 24 hours from the end of IV infusion) during the maintenance phase was reported 
for 2 (3.1%) patients in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm, one patient was withdrawn from the study at 
Week 14 due to this event. Both were ADA and NAb positive when IRRs occurred and both events were 
grade 2 in intensity. The reported sign and symptom was dyspnea. The patients recovered without 
treatment within a day. 
The TEAEs classified as grade 1 SIR (AEs checked as ARR in the eCRF and occurred between start of 
administration and 24 hours from the SC injection) during the maintenance phase was reported for 1 
(1.5%) CD patient, at week 52, in SC 120/240 mg treatment arm only. This patient’s ADA and NAb 
results were all negative over the study period. The reported signs and symptoms were nausea and 
dizziness. The patient recovered without treatment within a day.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 103/157
The TEAEs classified as delayed hypersensitivity (AEs checked as ARR in the eCRF and that occurred 
after 24 hours from the study drug administration) were reported for 2 (3.0%) patients in SC 120/240 
mg treatment arm only. 
One UC patient experienced TEAE classified as delayed hypersensitivity 2 days after the study drug 
administration at Week 6 with sign and symptom of vascular headache. The patient’s ADA and NAb 
results were negative when the event occurred. The patient recovered without treatment within a day. 
Another CD patient experienced TEAE classified as delayed hypersensitivity 1 day after the study drug 
administration at Week 52 with signs and symptoms of edema and flushing. Patient’s ADA results 
performed on Week 46 and Week 54 were positive while the NAb results were negative. The patient 
recovered without treatment 3 days after onset. Complement tests were not provided for either of 
these events.
There were no notable differences between the two treatment arms in proportion of patients with 
TEAEs classified as SIR or delayed hypersensitivity on or after Week 30.
Localised Injection Site Reaction 
Maintenance Phase
As expected for the SC route of administration, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 
TEAE classified as localised ISR during the maintenance phase was higher in the SC 120/240 mg 
treatment arm compared to the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm (15 [22.7%] and 3 [4.6%] patients in the 
SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). 
The most frequently reported signs and symptoms of localised ISR in all patients during the 
maintenance phase were injection site erythema; they were of grade 1 or 2 in intensity and majority of 
the patients recovered without any treatments. 
No serious localised ISRs were reported.
The TEAEs classified as localised ISR on or after Week 30 were reported, in all, in 9 (6.9%) patients, (7 
[10.6%] and 2 [3.1%] patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). 
Of these, 3 out of the 7 patients in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm had reported localised ISR 
before Week 30.

Abbreviations: ISR, injection site reaction; IV, intravenous; PT, preferred term; SC, subcutaneous; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event. Note: 
At each level of summarization, patients were counted once if they reported 1 or more events. Only the most severe event was counted. The event 
was considered to be related to the study drug by the investigator if the relationship was defined as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”. The 
intensity was defined as grade 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = death. From MedDRA, Version 20.1.Preferred term 
reported as “injection site reaction”. 
Infections
Maintenance Phase
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE classified as infection during the 
maintenance phase was similar between the 2 treatment arms (21 [31.8%] and 19 [29.2%] patients 
in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
The most frequently reported TEAEs classified as infection during the maintenance phase were 
nasopharyngitis reported in 4 (6.1%) patients for the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm and 
nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, latent TB and sinusitis reported in 2 (3.1%) patients each for the IV 5 
mg/kg treatment arm; majority were grade 1 or 2 in intensity.
In CD patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE classified as infection 
during the maintenance phase was slightly higher in the SC arm (11 [39.3%] and 7 [28.0%] patients 
for the SC and IV arms, respectively). Of these, 2 out of 11 patients in the SC 120/240 mg treatment 
arm had a medical history of infection, which was directly related to the TEAE classified as infection. 
Furthermore, 7 out of 11 patients in SC 120/240 mg treatment arm and 4 out of 7 patients in the IV 
arm used long-term immunosuppressants as prior and/or concomitant medications, until the events 
occurred. 
In UC patients, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE classified as infection during 
the maintenance phase was similar in the 2 treatment arms (10 [26.3%] and 12 [30%] patients for 
the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively).
Malignancy
Maintenance Phase
The TEAE classified as malignancy during the maintenance phase was reported for 1 (1.5%) patient in 
SC 120/240 mg treatment arm only. The patient (CD) was a 67-year-old white female who received 
the first dose of study drug on 04 July 2018 and experienced grade 3 NSCLC 1 day after Week 50 drug 
administration. As a result, the patient was hospitalised and received left upper lobectomy and

chemotherapy. The investigator reported the causal relationship of the event to study drug as possibly 
related and the patient discontinued the study due to this event. The event was considered resolved 
with the sequelae of left upper lobectomy.
Laboratory findings
Over time, the changes from baseline in all clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and hematology laboratory  
parameters were generally small, and there were no notable differences between the 2 treatment arms 
(for CRP and ESR see PD section of this AR).
Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities
The majority of patients had no CTCAE grade or CTCAE grade 1 (mild) for each laboratory parameter 
and each subsequent time point. The majority of the abnormal laboratory results with CTCAE grade 3 
(severe) or higher were reported during the maintenance phase (Table 46).

Complement (C3, C4) and Total Hemolytic Complement
Complement tests (C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement) were assessed at Week 0 for all patients 
in each treatment arm and when a patient experienced a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to 
determine serum sickness. Two cases of delayed hypersensitivity, occurring after 24 hours of study 
drug administration, were observed in the SC 120/240 mg arm. These two cases were both considered 
minor event and they resolved without requiring treatment. No confirmed cases of serum sickness 
were observed in the study. 
Vital Sign Measurements, Hypersensitivity Monitoring, and Other Observations Related to 
Safety
Vital Signs, Weight, and Body Mass Index
Mean changes from baseline in vital sign, during hypersensitivity monitoring and weight values were 
small, and there were no notable differences between the 2 treatment arms at any time point. In both 
treatment arms, the most commonly reported clinically notable vital sign results during 
hypersensitivity monitoring were high diastolic blood pressure. 
Electrocardiogram Patients with normal or abnormal, not clinically significant ECG results at baseline 
did not have clinically significant ECG result at post-baseline scheduled visits, except for 3 (2.3%) 
patients (2 patients in the SC 120/240 mg and 1 patient in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm). 
Physical examination The majority of patients generally had normal baseline physical examination 
findings, which remained normal at each post-baseline visit excluding EOS and unscheduled visit. 
Tuberculosis A single patient with UC in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm was withdrawn due to reported 
grade 3 TESAE of disseminated TB after Week 14. 
Local Site Pain Higher level of mean VAS of local site pain was observed in the SC arm at logical time 
points, as at the first time of SC injection and at treatment switch.
Safety in special populations
Adverse Events by Age
Overall, no consistent trend between the subgroups of different ages was observed in both treatment 
arms (Table 47).

adverse event.
Adverse Events by Gender
For TEAE, the incidence rate of TEAE was higher in the female patients (83.3%) than male patients 
(66.7%) in the SC 120/240 mg arm. However, this was likely driven by the higher rate of localised 
ISR, which were all Grade 1 or 2 in severity.
Adverse Events by Infliximab Serum Concentration Level
Key safety features were analysed by serum concentration level for the patients of the SC 120/240 mg 
arm in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, and are summarised in Table 48. The patients were categorised using 
33rd and 67th percentile of mean pre-dose serum concentration at Weeks 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54. 
Overall, there was no apparent correlation between the incidence of the events and mean pre-dose 
serum concentration level in patients administered with CT-P13 SC.

Adverse Events by Weight (<80 kg; > 80 kg) 
A requested subgroup analysis by body weight of < 80 kg and ≥ 80 kg showed (acknowledging the low 
numbers in some of the weight subgroups) no apparent correlation between body weight and the 
safety profiles of either the CT-P13 IV or SC treatment arms.
Immunological events and Immunogenicity 
Immunological events 
The  infliximab  in  Remsima  IV  and  SC  preparations  is  manufactured  under  similar  conditions  and  the 
only differences in composition of the products is the addition of acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate 
and sorbitol to the SC formulation. None of these excipients have been described as being associated 
with an impact on the immunogenicity of a therapeutic protein in humans.
Immunogenicity
The comparison of the immunogenicity profiles of Remsima IV and SC are based on two single dose 
studies in healthy subjects (CT-P13 1.5 and CT-P13 1.9) and two multiple dose studies in RA and CD 
patients (CT-P13 3.5 and CT-P13 1.6). Results from studies CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 1.9 and CT-P13 3.5 
and preliminary results from Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 have been assessed in the line extension 
application (EMEA/H/C/2576/X/62). Briefly, the results were as follows:
- In healthy volunteers (HV), the proportion of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralising antibodies 
(NAb) positive patients were higher in the CT-P13 SC cohorts compared to the CT-P13 IV cohort 
(Study CT-P13 1.5). 
- In contrast to what was observed in healthy volunteers, in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
and RA patients, the ADA results showed a trend to comparable proportions of patients with positive 
ADA response between the CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC arms (Studies CT-P13 1.6 and CT-P13 3.5). 
- ADA presence was associated with reduced drug exposure, while the degree of impact of the ADA 
status on the drug exposure was similar between the CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC arms (Study CT-P13 
3.5 Part 2)
- Higher ADA titre was associated with slightly reduced efficacy. Nonetheless, there was no evidence 
that the presence of ADAs is associated with clinical deterioration or with an increased safety risk 
(Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2)
Taking into consideration the potential for drug interference due to the relatively high drug serum 
concentrations observed in samples taken from patients receiving CT-P13 SC, the MAH has developed 
a new ADA assay method based on an ECL platform. Therefore, immunogenicity samples in Study CT-
P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2 and Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 were re-analysed.

discontinuation before switching to CT-P13 SC at Week 30 in the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg arm or before randomisation at Week 6 in the CT-P13 SC 
120/ 240 mg arm, the EOS visit occurred 8 weeks after the last dose of CT-P13 IV was received. In Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, the EOS assessments 
were completed 2 weeks after the last dose of CT-P13 SC was received. For patients who discontinued the study early, before Week 30, all EOS 
assessments  were  completed  8  weeks  after  the  last  CT-P13  IV  or  placebo  IV  was  received  (Weeks  0,  2,  6,  14,  and  22).  For  patients  who 
discontinued the study early, on or after Week 30, EOS assessments were completed 2 weeks after the last CT-P13 SC was received. In Korea, all 
EOS assessments were completed 8 weeks after the last study drug administration. CD: Crohn’s disease, EOS: End-of-study, RA: Rheumatoid

1 Immunogenicity results up to Week 30 were analysed using the ADA ELISA and NAb ECL bead methods. 2 Patients who had at least 1 “positive” 
ADA or NAb result at post-dose visits up to Week 30 (for ADA ELISA & NAb ECL bead methods) or Week 54 (for new ADA ECL ACE & NAb 
ECL ACE methods) including all available results at EOS and unscheduled visits regardless of their ADA or NAb status at baseline. In Study CT-
P13 1.6 Part 2, all EOS assessments were completed 2 weeks after the last study drug administration. For patients with early discontinuation before 
switching to CT-P13 SC at Week 30 in the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg arm or before randomisation at Week 6 in the CT-P13 SC 120/ 240 mg arm, the EOS 
visit occurred 8 weeks after the last dose of CT-P13 IV
In study 1.6 Part 2 the mean and the median of ADA titres were generally comparable between the 2 
arms up to Week 54 with overlapping confidence intervals at all sampling time points.  According to 
the summary of NAb titres depicted in the CSR of CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, also the NAb titres between the 2 
arms were generally comparable.

Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2:
Analysed with the new ADA assay, the proportion of post-treatment ADA positive patients up to Week 
30 were slightly higher in the CT-P13 IV 3 mg/kg arm than in the CT-P13 SC 120 mg arm: 123   
(70.3%) and 99 (58.9%) patients in the CT-P13 IV 3 mg/kg and CT-P13 SC 120 mg arms, 
respectively. Among the patients who had post-treatment positive ADA results, 106 (86.2%) and 64 
(64.6%) patients, respectively showed NAb positive response.
After switching to CT-P13 SC administration at Week 30 in the CT-P13 IV 3 mg/kg arm, the proportion 
of patients who had ADA positive results were comparable between the 2 arms up to Week 54. This 
analysis further supports that switching the maintenance therapy from CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC did 
not lead to an increased ADA incidence.

1 Patients who had at least 1 “positive” ADA or NAb result at post-dose visits up to Week 54 including EOS and unscheduled visits regardless of 
their ADA or NAb status at baseline. In Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, the EOS assessments were completed 2 weeks after the last dose of CT-P13 SC 
was received. For patients who discontinued the study early, before Week 30, all EOS assessments were completed 8 weeks after the last CT-P13 
IV or placebo IV was received (Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22). For patients who discontinued the study early, on or after Week 30, EOS assessments 
were completed 2 weeks after the last CT-P13 SC was received. In Korea, all EOS assessments were completed 8 weeks after the last study drug 
administration.  Immunogenicity  at  unscheduled  visit  was  defined  as  immunogenicity  results  of  samples  collected  at  non-scheduled 
immunogenicity testing visit or those of samples collected due to delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
Note:  The  proportion  of  ADA  positive  patients  was  calculated  using  the  number  of  patients  in  Safety  population  per  treatment  arm  as  the 
denominator. The proportion of NAb positive patients was re-calculated using ADA positive patients as a denominator.
All analyses were conducted by excluding the data of patients from the significant GCP non-compliance site (site 2840 in Russia). ACE: Affinity 
capture elution, ADA: Anti-drug antibody, ECL: Electrochemiluminescent, ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, EOS: End-of-study, 
GCP: Good Clinical Practice, IV: Intravenous, n: Number of patients with the event, N: Number of patients in each arm in Safety population, NAb: 
Neutralising antibody, SC: Subcutaneous
The mean and the median of ADA titres were generally comparable between the two administration 
routes up to Week 54. 
Effect of ADA on PK and efficacy in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 (CD and UC Patients)
In Study 1.6 Part 2 (CD and UC patients) the presence of ADA in serum resulted in an overall decrease 
in drug levels. The mean pre-dose serum concentrations tended to be slightly lower in the ADA positive 
subgroup both in the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg and the CT-P13 SC 120/ 240 mg arms up to Week 54, but 
the ADA positive patients of the CT-P13 SC 120/ 240 mg arm still showed higher drug levels compared 
to both ADA positive and ADA negative patients in the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg arm.

Effect of ADA on safety in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 (CD and UC Patients)
During the Maintenance Phase up to Week 54 of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, a subgroup analysis on 
incidences of infection and immune-mediated adverse events (infusion related reaction [IRR; IV only], 
systemic injection reaction [SIR; SC only], delayed hypersensitivity and localised injection site reaction 
[ISR]) as well as treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and treatment-emergent serious AE 
(TESAE) by post-treatment ADA status was conducted. 
The results demonstrated that there was overall no apparent correlation between the immune-
mediated AEs, TEAE, TESAE or infection rates and ADA presence. In the SC 120/ 240 mg arm, the 
incidences of localised ISR were slightly higher in the post-treatment ADA negative subgroup than in 
the post- treatment ADA positive subgroup: 7/18 (38.9%) and 8/48 (16.7%) patients, respectively 
(Table 58). However, the reported localised ISRs were all non-serious AEs with grade 1 or 2. Most 
patients recovered within a few days. The analysis of the results of incidences of AEs stratified by ADA 
titre tertile at Week 54 also showed that there was no specific pattern in incidences of AEs and ADA 
titres across tertiles.

(including EOS and unscheduled visits) after study drug administration were considered. In Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, all EOS assessments were 
completed 2 weeks after the last study drug administration. For patients with early discontinuation before switching to CT-P13 SC at Week 30 in the 
CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg arm or before randomisation at Week 6 in the CT-P13 SC 120/ 240 mg arm, the EOS visit occurred 8 weeks after the last dose

immunogenicity testing visit or those of samples collected due to delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Infusion Related Reaction: AEs checked as ARR 
in the eCRF and occurred between IV infusion start and after 24 hours of IV infusion end. Systemic Injection Reaction: AEs checked as ARR in the 
eCRF and occurred between SC injection start and after 24 hours of SC injection start. Delayed Hypersensitivity: AEs checked as ARR in the eCRF 
and that occurred after 24 hours of IV infusion end or of SC injection start. Localized Injection Site Reaction: AEs classified as injection site reaction

Effect  of  ADA  on  Safety  in  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2  (RA  Patients)  -  new  ADA  and  NAb  ECL  ACE 
methods 
Similar analyses were conducted with data from Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 in a post-hoc manner to 
assess potential impact of ADA on safety. The results demonstrated that there was overall no apparent 
correlation between the rate of immune-mediated AEs and ADA presence. The incidence rates of SIR, 
localised ISR and delayed hypersensitivity and AEs were similar between the post-treatment ADA 
positive and negative subgroups for both arms. However, opposite trends were observed for TESAE 
between the 2 arms; the incidence rate of TESAE for post-treatment ADA positive and negative 
subgroups were 8.5% and 4.3%, respectively in the CT-P13 IV arm, and 2.6% and 5.6%, respectively 
in the CT-P13 SC arm) (Table 59). Moreover, the incidence of infection/immune-mediated AEs, TEAE 
and TESAE by ADA titre quartile showed no apparent correlation between ADA titre and AE incidences.

Impact of Immunosuppressive Therapies on Immunogenicity
To support extrapolation of immunogenicity data collected from RA and IBD patients to AS, PsA and Ps 
indications, the MAH has investigated the impact of concomitant immunosuppressants on ADA based 
on the data from historical literature as well as CT-P13 IV and SC studies.
In Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 up to Week 30 with CD and UC patients, immunosuppressants (such as 
AZA, 6-MP and MTX) were allowed. The proportion of patients who used immunosuppressants up to 
Week 30 was 58/131 (44.3%).
Consistent with the result in previous studies, the patients who received immunosuppressants showed 
reduced ADA incidence compared to the patients who did not receive immunosuppressants. A total of 
16/58 (27.6%) patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressants were ADA positive while 44/73 
(60.3%) patients without immunosuppressant were ADA positive. The impact of immunosuppressant 
on ADA presence was comparable between the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg and CT-P13 SC 120/ 240 mg arms 
(Table 60).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
No interaction studies have been performed with CT-P13 SC.
Post marketing experience
CT-P13 SC has been authorised for marketing in the EU for the adult RA indication only; however, up 
to the date of submission for this Type II variation, it has not been marketed in the EU or any country 
worldwide.
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Summary of the clinical safety database
The originator infliximab, Remicade IV, has been approved in the EU since 1999. The safety profile of 
infliximab has been well characterised by more than 20 years of clinical use. Thus, the overall total 
cumulative exposure with infliximab IV, including also the post-marketing exposure, is significant. 
Remsima SC is the very first SC formulation for infliximab, and is considered as such a ‘stand-alone 
application’. The complete safety data for Remsima SC studies CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 1.9, CT-P13 3.5 
Part 1 and Part 2 and Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 in CD patients have been assessed in the line extension 
application (EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062).
In the current application, new data was submitted on the clinical safety (week 54) of Remsima SC 
compared to Remsima IV, in IBD subjects, with CD and UC, in study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2. This completes 
the MAH’s current Remsima SC development database. 
The safety of Remsima SC has not been studied in AS, Ps and PsA, which is in accordance with the 
CHMP scientific advice. The aim is to extend the Remsima SC indication from the source population (RA 
and IBD) to these target patient populations (AS, Ps and PsA).
Overall exposure
In this application the overall planned Remsima SC development programme, including patient 
exposure data and overall safety data, have been complemented and completed by the week 54 data 
of the study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2. The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 
dose of study drug at Week 6 or thereafter. 
In all, 819 subjects (391 RA patients, 97 CD patients, 78 UC patients and 253 healthy subjects) have 
been  exposed  to  at  least  1  dose  of  CT-P13  IV  or  SC  across  four  controlled  clinical  studies.  A  total  of 
751  subjects  (363  RA  patients,  79  CD  patients,  74  UC  patients  and  235  healthy  subjects)  have 
received at least 1 dose of CT-P13 SC, including 160 RA patients from Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 and 20 
CD and 36 UC patients from Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2, who switched to CT-P13 SC treatment at Week 
30. From Week 6 to Week 54, 249 patients overall (172 RA, 44 CD and 33 UC patients) received CT-
P13 SC and among them, 201 patients (155 RA, 24 CD and 22 UC patients) received 120 mg of CT-
P13 SC. It is acknowledged that the overall exposure, in terms of patient numbers, to Remsima SC, in 
all the clinical studies of the entire MAH SC development programme appears not extensive, especially 
considering the numerous indications applied for.
Overall,  with  respect  to  the  mean  (SD)  values  of  total  administered  doses  up  to  and  including  Week 
54,  both  in  the  loading  and  maintenance  phases,  and  between  the  two  UC  and  CD  patient  groups  of 
the SC 120 mg treatment arm, were largely similar to that of IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm. In addition, 
the total number of doses received were broadly similar. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 118/157
The number of patients with at least 1 escalated dose was also similar between the 2 treatment arms. 
The  majority  of  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  were  continuing  the  study  at  Week  54.  During  the 
maintenance phase, 11 (16.7%) patients in the SC 120/240 mg arm and 15 (23.1%) patients in the IV 
5  mg/kg  treatment  arm  discontinued  the  study,  which  is  an  acceptable  attrition  rate  for  this  type  of 
study. 
However, of note is that after SC administration, AUC-levels were higher and Ctrough concentrations 
were up to ten-fold higher in comparison to IV administration. This is a safety concern, especially in 
long-term, beyond the currently available 54 weeks exposure, as data on effects of this on patient 
safety, particularly concerning serious infections (including TB and other opportunistic infections) is still 
scarce, and data on cancer is still unknown. So far, in short term and up to week 54, no clinically 
relevant, unexpected safety signals have been identified. Also, the vast experience on infliximab in 
general needs to be taken into account here. In addition, the MAH is proposing a robust post-approval 
programme to further characterise the safety of SC Remsima. Thus, the size of the safety database 
and duration of exposure is considered appropriate for the evaluation of the general safety profile of 
SC Remsima and, overall, could be sufficient also for the intended extrapolation purposes, considering 
the existence of the company robust post marketing plan, pending the RSI.
Safety in study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2
Adverse events
The selection of the variables for the safety assessment is considered adequate by the CHMP.
Safety data has been presented for three different study periods: treatment period, which consisted of 
the dose-loading phase (all patients receiving IV Remsima) and the maintenance phase (one arm 
receiving SC and one IV Remsima); the maintenance phase and the On-or-after-Week 30 phase, 
where IV-patients were switched to SC administration. The focus is on the maintenance phase, 
allowing direct comparison of SC and IV safety data. It is, however, noted that the ‘treatment period’ 
reflects best how the product will be used in real-world situation. However, as the focus is on the 
comparison of safety data between IV Remsima and SC Remsima, result mainly for the most sensitive 
period for comparing these two products, the maintenance phase, is reported in more detail.
In the entire treatment period (including both the loading and the maintenance phases) the 
proportions of patients with at least one TEAE, TESAE, TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug, 
TEAE classified as IRR, SIR and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, were no higher in the SC group 
compared to the IV group. The respective numbers for infections were also similar between the 
groups, 24 (36.4%) in the SC and 20 (30.8%) in the IV treatment arm. The proportion of patients that 
reported localised injection site reactions (ISR) was notably higher in the SC group (for details see 
under dedicated heading below). 
In the maintenance phase, the number and pattern of events were similar and comparable between 
the treatment groups. The rates for infections were also similar in the two arms, 21 (31.8%) in the SC 
and 19 (29.2%) in the IV arms and comparable to those found in the pivotal RA study, 29.2% and 
34.3%, respectively. The localised ISRs were again clearly more common in the SC group 22.7% than 
in the IV group 4.6%. Overall, however, there were slightly more TEAEs in the SC arm (74.2% vs 
58.5%), which seemed to be due to the increased number of localised ISRs. 
Switching treatments appeared not to have a clear effect on safety, as in the period on and after week 
30, the number and patter of events were alike between the treatment arms and did not differ 
markedly or rates were slightly lower than those of the maintenance phase (for example infections 
were seen in 18.2% vs 13.8% in SC and IV groups). Overall, again, there were slightly more TEAEs in 
the SC arm (47.0% vs 32.3%), again, probably driven by the higher incidence of localised ISR.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 119/157
Thus, when analysing the number of patients that reported adverse events and the type of events 
recorded, the data did not reveal any unexpected findings, and the safety profile of Remsima SC no 
worse than that of Remsima IV and the known overall safety profile of infliximab. The single notable 
finding among otherwise comparable safety data, between two treatment arms, was the higher 
proportion of patients that reported localised ISR in the SC group. Bearing in mind that the SC 
formulation was administered every two weeks and the IV formulation every 8 weeks, these local 
reactions would be expected to be even higher in the SC group. The overall safety profile of the 
patients treated with SC was no worse compared to the IV in the incidence of AE, even after switching.  
The incidence rates were slightly different, when analysing the safety data for TEAE reported for at 
least 5% of patients. In the maintenance phase (most sensitive evaluation period to compare SC and 
IV formulations), the following incidence rates were recorded: gastrointestinal disorders 14 (21.2%) 
and 11 (16.9%), localised ISR 15 (22.7%) and 3 (4.6%) and infections and infestations (namely 
nasopharyngitis) 4 (6.1%) and 2 (3.1%) and blood and lymphatic system disorders 7 (10.6%) and 3 
(4.6%) in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively. Association with switching appeared unlikely, 
with the trend less evident after switching for localised ISR and the single PT of abdominal pain, 
remaining. Otherwise, there were no obvious differences, including the event of headache. 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE considered to be related to study drug 
during the maintenance phase was slightly higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm (28 [42.4%] 
vs 20 [30.8%] in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm). The most frequently reported were localised ISR 
(and rash for the IV arm) with again the number higher for the SC route 14 (21.2%) and only 3 
(4.6%) for the IV route, which appears not unexpected. The pattern was less evident after switching 
and the rates slightly lower (7 [10.6%] patients) in the SC and (2 [3.1%]) in the IV treatment arm.  
The majority of TEAEs reported during the maintenance phase were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in intensity. 
Significant differences were not evident in events of grade 3 and higher, between the two treatment 
arms, even after switching.
Thus, overall, when analysing the number of patients that reported adverse events and the type of 
events recorded, the data did not reveal any unexpected findings, and the safety profile of Remsima 
SC was no worse than that of Remsima IV and the known overall safety profile of infliximab. The single 
notable, but not unexpected finding (considering the SC route of administration) among otherwise 
comparable safety data, between two treatment arms, was the higher proportion of patients that 
reported localised ISR in the SC group (see below for details). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The TESAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were rare, solitary cases 
reported for 1 (1.5%) patient (NSCLC) in the SC 120/240 mg and 2 (3.1%) patients (bronchitis, 
pneumonia, disseminated tuberculosis) in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm, respectively. No differences 
were evident between CD and UC patients or when switching formulations. No deaths were reported 
during the study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events
The TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug during the maintenance phase were 
reported for 1 (1.5%) and 3 (4.6%) patients in the SC 120/240 mg (NSCLC) and IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arms (IRR, psoriasis and disseminated TB), respectively. All four events were considered 
related to the study drug, were rare, solitary cases, of grade 2 or 3, no more numerous in patients 
treated with the SC formulation. The nature of the SAE did not differ from previously reported. 
Switching of treatment appeared not to associate with them.  
TEAE of special interest
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 120/157
Infusion Related Reaction, Systemic Injection Reaction or Delayed Hypersensitivity Treatment Period
The TEAEs classified as IRR (grade 2) reported for two (3.1%) patients in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment 
arm. The TEAEs classified as SIR was reported for one (1.5%) patient in SC 120/240 mg treatment 
arm only. The TEAEs classified as delayed hypersensitivity were reported (one at week 6 and one at 
week 52; vascular headache, and edema and flushing) for two (3.0%) patients in SC 120/240 mg 
treatment arm. Complement tests were not done. One patient was negative and one positive for ADA, 
the latter negative for NAbs. Both patients recovered within 1-3 days without treatment. 
The ARR rates in IBD patients were low, incidences rare, and with no differences between the mode of 
administration, SC or IV. This was in spite of the more common use of corticosteroids for systemic use 
in the IV arm. Further, ARR were no more numerous in comparison to those reported in the pivotal RA 
study 1 (0.6%) in SC and 8 (4.5%) in IV arms, respectively (see effects Table of this AR). This is, in 
all, of importance, as infliximab is known to be very immunogenic (with 30% murine variable region 
amino acid sequence), a trait that is likely to be influenced by both use of immunosuppressants and 
mode of administration (the subcutaneous route often being the more immunogenic one). This could 
have consequences for clinical safety (as well as efficacy), but so far, this appears not to be the case 
for SC Remsima. Moreover, this should be considered acknowledging that the IV infliximab is 
administered in a controlled clinical (hospital) setting, whereas SC Remsima will be used at home.  
Localised injection site reactions 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE classified as localised ISR during the 
maintenance phase was higher in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm compared to the IV 5 mg/kg 
treatment arm, 15 (22.7%) and 3 (4.6%) patients in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively. 
Among these patients, two in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm experienced TEAEs classified as localised 
ISR on or after Week 30 that is after switching. 
The most frequently reported signs and symptoms of localised ISR in all patients were injection site 
erythema (10 [15.2%] and 2 [3.1%] patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, 
respectively). All events were of grade 1 or 2 in intensity and the majority of the patients recovered 
without any treatments. No serious localised ISRs were reported.
The TEAEs classified as localised ISR on or after Week 30 were reported, in all, in 9 (6.9%) patients; 7 
(10.6%) and 2 (3.1%) patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. 
Of these, three out of the seven patients in the SC 120/240 mg treatment arm had reported localised 
ISR before Week 30.
In conclusion, a notable finding among the TEAEs was the higher incidence of grade 1 and 2 localised 
ISR in patients treated with the SC formulation, 15 (22.7%) SC and 3 (4.6%) IV, which appeared not 
to associate with switching. This was comparable to the results, 30 (17.9%) SC and 22 (12.6%) IV, of 
the pivotal RA study (see effects Table of this assessment report). The finding is not unexpected and 
similar rates have been shown to be comparable to rates for other licenced SC TNFα-inhibitors, also 
used in the home-administration setting. It should also be kept in mind that not all localised ISRs are 
immune-mediated, such as haemorrhage and pain. Section 4.8 of SmPC is updated to report the 
higher incidence of localised ISR after SC injection from the phase 1 study in patients with CD and UC. 
Infections
The number of patients in total (31 and 24) and the number (%) with at least 1 TEAE classified as 
infection during the maintenance phase were similar between the 2 treatment arms 21 (31.8%) and 
19 (29.2%) with the patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. 
Most of the events were of grade 1 or 2 in intensity. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 121/157
Findings were, overall, similar between the subgroups of CD and UC patients, although in CD patients 
slight imbalance was seen (39.3% and 28% in SC and IV arms). However, the numbers were small, so 
no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
A single patient with UC in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm was withdrawn due to grade 3 TESAE of 
disseminated TB after Week 14. 
In conclusion, infections were no more numerous in the SC than in the IV treatment arm, in the overall 
IBD study population. The pattern and numbers were largely comparable to that in the pivotal RA 
population (see effects Table of this AR). Serious infections were rare in both treatment arms and 
similar to previously reported. Further post-marketing studies are included in the RMP to follow also 
infections in patients receiving SC Remsima.
Malignancy
A single malignancy was reported in the study for 1 (1.5%) patient with CD in the SC 120/240 mg 
treatment arm (NSCLC, after week 50) judged possibly related to the treatment. The follow-up is too 
short for any conclusions. 
Laboratory findings
Over time, the changes from baseline in all clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and hematology laboratory 
parameters were generally small, and there were no notable differences between the two treatment 
arms, most patients having no or of mild grade derangement. Most of the laboratory findings, graded 
as severe or life threatening, were low in numbers (1 to 2 cases), with no differences between the 
treatment arms. They included a case of elevated liver enzyme in the IV arm and two patients with 
elevated CPK, one each GGT and triglycerides in the SC arm and anemia and decreased lymphocyte 
and platelet counts in the SC arm and WBC in the IV arm. Neutropenia was, however, reported more 
often, grade 3 in 3 (4.5) and in 4 (6.2) patients and a case of grade 4 each, in the SC and IV 
respectively. Overall the numbers were small, and no clear trends were seen. These laboratory finding 
appear not unexpected and are comparable to findings inherent to this IBD patient group and to the 
treatment. 
Safety in special populations
The incidence of serious infections in infliximab-treated patients 65 years and older has been reported 
to be greater than that of under 65 years of age (Remsima SmPC, 2019). The current data presented 
for Remsima IV, Remicade IV, and Remsima SC in the RA and IBD indications appears discrepant and 
varied and the data should be interpreted with caution, as the numbers of patients in some subgroup 
were small. Analysis of AE by age were hampered by the small numbers of patients in the subgroup of 
>65 year olds.
A requested subgroup analysis by body weight of < 80 kg and ≥ 80 kg showed (acknowledging the low 
numbers in some of the weight subgroups) that there was no apparent correlation between body 
weight and the safety profiles in either of the CT-P13 IV or SC treatment arms.
Gender appeared not to have effect in the incidence of the safety variables.  
There was no apparent correlation or trends evident, between the incidence of the events and mean 
pre-dose serum concentration level in patients administered with CT-P13 SC. Previous literature search 
by the MAH on this issue has yielded conflicting results. However, after SC administration Ctrough 
concentrations were up to ten-fold higher in comparison to IV route. This is a safety concern, also in 
the elderly, especially in long-term, as data on effects of this on patient safety is still scarce or even 
unknown beyond the 54 weeks follow-up. So far, in short term and up to week 54, it appears that no 
clinically relevant, unexpected safety signals have been identified. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 122/157
No interaction studies have been performed with CT-P13 SC.
Immunogenicity
The overall program, including the sampling schedules and duration of follow-up, was approved by 
CHMP through scientific advice and is adequate for demonstrating comparability of immunogenicity of 
SC and IV formulations in RA, CD and UC patients. Extrapolation of the results to As, PsA and Ps are 
discussed in the benefit risk section.
In light of the observed drug concentrations in studies 3.5 and 1.6, the drug tolerance of the new ADA 
assay is acceptable. 
Antibody levels as low as 100 ng/mL have been proposed to be clinically significant, but the level with 
clinical significance is dependent on concentrations of the therapeutic drug. In light of the observed 
drug concentrations in studies 3.5 and 1.6, the drug tolerance of the new Nab assay is acceptable in 
terms of detecting clinically significant NAb levels. However, for comparability of results between IV 
and SC arms, the drug tolerance is not optimal. Because of different drug concentrations in the two 
treatment arms, comparison of the incidence of detected NAb may be misleading.
Results
ADA/NAb incidence and titre 
The detected ADA and NAb incidences increased when the new methods were applied. The drug 
tolerance was sufficient for ADA detection as drug concentration levels were below 120.0 μg/mL for all 
samples in the ADA negative samples. 
In study 1.6 Part 1 the incidence of ADA was comparable between IV and SC treatments.  The 
incidence of clinically relevant levels of NAb was not higher in the SC arms. The mean and the median 
of ADA titres were generally comparable between the two administration routes up to Week 54. 
In study 1.6 Part 2 the incidence of ADA was comparable between IV and SC treatments.  During the 
maintenance phase 44 (67.7%) and 48 (72.7%) patients in the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg and CT-P13 SC 
120/ 240 mg arms, respectively were ADA positive. After switching to SC administration at Week 30, 
the ADA positive rates were slightly lower in the IV arm up to Week 54. The post-treatment 
measurements, including EOS for discontinued patients and unscheduled visits, were comparable up to 
week 30 and up to week 54 with overlapping confidence intervals. Switching therapy from IV to SC 
administration did not result in increased immunogenicity.
In study 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2 the incidence of ADA was not higher in the SC arm than in the IV arm. 
The incidence of clinically relevant levels of NAb was not higher in the SC arms. The mean and the 
median of ADA titres were generally comparable between the two administration routes up to Week 
54. Switching the maintenance therapy from IV to SC at week 30 did not lead to an increased ADA 
incidence in the original IV arm.
Effect of ADA on PK, efficacy and safety
The presence of ADA in serum resulted in an overall decrease in drug levels, but the SC treatment 
remained non-inferior in terms of drug exposure (Ctrough and AUC) even among ADA positive patients 
throughout the study.  
In study 1.6 Part 2, the impact of the ADA status on the proportion of remitters is counterintuitive, as 
the remission rates are slightly lower among ADA negative patients than among ADA positive patients. 
However, the number of patients in the subgroups are very small, and preclude any definitive 
conclusions. The proportion of patients reaching clinical remission among ADA positive patients was 
numerically slightly greater in the SC arm compared to the IV arm in both CD and UC patients. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 123/157
Overall, there was no apparent correlation between the immune-mediated AEs, TEAE, TESAE or 
infection rates and ADA presence and there was no specific pattern in incidences of AEs and ADA titres 
across tertiles. The results were similar in RA patients (study CT-P13 3.5). Overall, numbers were 
small in some comparisons, thus firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
Impact of Immunosuppressive Therapies on Immunogenicity
Overall, based on the historical literature and immunogenicity data from CT-P13 IV/SC trials in RA and 
IBD  patients,  the  results  show  that  the  concomitant  use  of  immunosuppressant  medication  is 
correlated with a reduced ADA incidence rate.
However, the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication (CIM) did not shift the relative 
immunogenicity between formulations. Among patients who did not use CIM 19/37 (51.4%) in the SC 
arm and 25/36 (69.4%) in the IV arm were ADA positive at week 30. The results from Study 1.6 Part 2 
were in line with previous results and confirmed that the SC formulation is not more immunogenic in 
either users or non-users of CIM.
The impact of immunosuppressant on the incidence of ARRs (including IRR, SIR and Delayed 
Hypersensitivity) and localised ISR was comparable between the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg and CT-P13 SC 
120/ 240 mg arms.
Home-administration
Infliximab is known to be very immunogenic (with 30% murine variable region amino acid sequence), 
a trait that is likely to be influenced by both use of immunosuppressants and mode of administration 
(subcutaneous route often being the more immunogenic, although almost the opposite has been 
shown for the SC Remsima). Importantly, IV infliximab has been administered in controlled clinical 
(hospital) setting, whereas, SC Remsima will be used at home. 
According to the earlier knowledge on the IV infliximab (reflected also in the IV-infliximab SmPC), 
patients who discontinue immunosuppressants prior to or during infliximab treatment are at greater 
risk of developing antibodies and thus, at risk of immune-related reactions. This is of importance, as 
unlike in the earlier approved SC RA indication, in the currently sought SC indications, infliximab may 
be given also without a concomitant immunosuppressant. Further, according to the IV SmPC, delayed 
hypersensitivity reactions occurred earlier in the treatment course, apparently especially in the IV 
psoriasis studies. Available data also suggest an increased risk for delayed hypersensitivity, with 
increasing infliximab-free interval. 
However, while the present data on patients treated without CIM is limited, and only on a few CD/UC-
patients, the results do not raise concerns regarding immunogenicity and safety in patients without 
concomitant methotrexate or other immunosuppressive medication. This is because the rate of ADA 
positivity was comparable (or even lower) in the SC arm than in the IV arm, ADA titres were 
comparable and the frequency of NAb was no higher in the SC arm, in spite of the new, more sensitive 
methodology. In addition, no apparent differences in the clinical consequences of ADA-formation were 
evident between the IV and SC groups. Based on a previous analysis performed by the MAH, the 
incidence of localised injection site reactions was comparable to other licensed SC TNFα-inhibitors, 
used in the home-administration setting.
Also, the proposed SmPC and PL clearly warn about allergic reactions/ delayed hypersensitivity. 
Importantly, Remsima SC treatment is to be initiated and supervised by qualified physicians, and 
suitability of the patient for subcutaneous home use should be assessed and patients should be 
advised to inform their healthcare professional if they experience symptoms of an allergic reaction 
before administering the next dose. Premedication is recommended in the loading phase. Thus, the 
SmPC and PL include sufficient warnings and instructions for home-use.
Conclusion on immunogenicity
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 124/157
Since the rate of ADA positivity was comparable or even numerically slightly lower in the SC arm than 
in the IV arm, ADA titres were comparable between the treatment arms and the frequency of NAb was 
not higher in the SC arm, it can be concluded that Remsima SC is non-inferior to Remsima IV in terms 
of immunogenicity. 
While the present data on patients treated without CIM is limited, the results do not raise concerns 
regarding immunogenicity and safety in patients without concomitant methotrexate or other 
immunosuppressive medication. Further data will be accrued in the post-approval pharmacovigilance 
programme. Thus, the use of Remsima SC, in all the sought indications, is acceptable also in the 
home-setting.
This overall supports the validity of extrapolation of the data to the indications where the use of CIM is 
less common than in RA.
Post marketing experience
Thus far, no post-marketing experience on the treatment of patient with the SC formulation exists.
The overall conclusion is that in the IBD study sample (adult patients with moderately active CU or 
moderate to severe UC) of study CT-P13 1.6 part 2, the overall safety in patients treated with 
Remsima SC 120/240 mg appears comparable to the safety of treatment with Remsima IV 5 mg/kg, 
excepting a higher incidence of localised ISR. The results did not raise concerns regarding 
immunogenicity and safety in patients with or without concomitant immunosuppressive medication. 
The SC formulation did not appear to be more immunogenic. In all, the safety profile of Remsima SC 
appears to be quite consistently similar to the previously described safety profile of SC infliximab in the 
SC development program (including the safety data on RA patients of the pivotal study) and also 
similar with the extensive safety data, including the post marketing safety data, available for the 
infliximab IV formulation.

Extrapolation of safety from RA and IBD to AS, PsA, Ps indications 
In the previous CHMP Scientific Advice, it was underlined that the expected safety database was to be 
sufficiently large to provide for a meaningful comparison of safety and immunogenicity, especially for 
the SC route of administration, provided that no new safety concerns arise, for example, a dramatic 
increase in the immunogenicity of CT-P13 by SC route.
It is acknowledged that the overall SC database is not extensive, especially considering that several 
indications without any clinical data (AS, PsA, Ps) are applied for. In all, 819 subjects (391 RA patients, 
97 CD patients, 78 UC patients and 253 healthy subjects) have been exposed to at least 1 dose of CT-
P13 IV or SC across four controlled clinical studies. A total of 751 subjects (363 RA patients, 79 CD 
patients, 74 UC patients and 235 healthy subjects) have received at least one dose of CT-P13 SC and 
of them 249 have been treated for up to week 54, that is, for up to a year and a further 277 patients 
for a shorter duration of time; among them 201 patients (155 RA, 24 CD and 22 UC patients) receiving 
the sought dose of 120 mg of CT-P13 SC for up to a year (for full details see Table 36 of this AR). 
The total numbers exposed would, for example, only just fulfill the ICH E1 guideline data requirements 
for long-term, and for overall data, for medicines of long-term use. However, the vast experience (over 
two decades) of treatment with IV infliximab, in general, needs to be taken into account here. Also, in 
this extrapolation setting, considering the strength of prior safety data, overall the quality of data, 
similarity and consistency of the Remsima SC safety findings, over indications and between the two 
formulations (excluding the elevated incidence of localised ISRs), the current Remsima SC safety 
database, even with its limitations, could be sufficient for the current extrapolation, with a prerequisite 
of an adequate and sufficiently robust post-marketing strategy (including dedicated post authorisation 
safety studies). The currently proposed post-marketing plan, including two placebo-controlled long-
term maintenance studies (one in CD-patients and one in UC-patients), as well as an observational 
study in AS, PsA and Ps-patients, together with the already agreed upon observational RA-study, are 
considered sufficient (see RMP section of this AR) and provided that the protocol is agreed on with the 
PRAC.
In this application, in the study CT-P13 1.6 part 2 a dose regimen of Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W as 
maintenance therapy is proposed as the optimal dosing regimen for all indications regardless of body 
weight.
In this study, the overall safety of adult patients with moderately active CD or moderate to severe UC 
treated with Remsima SC infliximab appeared comparable to the safety of treatment with the Remsima 
IV formulation, excepting a higher incidence of localised ISR. Apart from this one exception, the safety 
profile was also consistent with the previously described safety profile of SC infliximab in the SC 
development program and the also with extensive safety data available for the infliximab IV 
formulation. 
Some inherent limitations to the overall SC safety data, however, remain. Concerning the rationale for 
extrapolation, it was noted that the baseline characteristics of the source populations (RA, IBD), are 
not fully representative for the intended target indications (AS, Ps and PsA); these patients are 
generally younger and do not receive concomitant immunosuppressant medication and existing data 
on use of SC infliximab without the concomitant immunosuppressive therapy is relatively scarce. In 
addition, the higher, up to ten-fold, Ctrough levels achieved, compared to IV, when on the proposed 
Remsima SC 120mg Q2W posology is, in longer term, a safety concern, although so far, in short term 
and up to week 54, no clinically relevant unexpected safety signals have been identified. 
In conclusion, in the study CT-P13 1.6 part 2 the overall safety of the IBD study sample (adult patients 
with moderately active CD or moderate to severe UC) treated with the proposed posology for Remsima 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 129/157
SC infliximab, appears comparable to the overall safety of infliximab IV, excepting a higher incidence 
of localised ISR. While the present data on patients treated without CIM is limited, the results do not 
raise concerns regarding immunogenicity and safety in patients without concomitant methotrexate or 
other immunosuppressive medication. This supports the validity of extrapolation of the safety data to 
the indications, where use of CIM is less common than in RA.
Considering the strength of the prior safety data, overall the quality of data, similarity and consistency 
of the Remsima SC safety findings, over indications and between the two formulations (excluding the 
elevated incidence of localised ISRs), the accrued Remsima SC safety data supports, from the safety 
point of view, the extrapolation of the safety to the AS, PsA, Ps indications.
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
In the study CT-P13 1.6 part 2 the overall safety of the IBD study sample (adult patients with 
moderately active CD or moderate to severe UC) treated with Remsima SC was largely comparable to 
the safety of treatment with the IV formulation, excepting a higher incidence of localised ISR and 
referring also to the RSI. This finding was expected with SC administration. Apart from this, the safety 
profile appeared consistent with the previously described safety profile of Remsima SC and with 
available extensive safety data for the infliximab IV formulation. 
Some uncertainties, also relevant for the extrapolation, of the Remsima SC safety data remain. They 
include:




the  higher  Ctrough  levels  achieved  with  the  proposed  Remsima  SC  posology  is  in  long-term  a 
safety concern. 
although  the  exposure  could  be  estimated  to  be  adequate  and  sufficient  for  the  present 
extrapolation  purposes,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  overall  patient  exposure  to  the  SC 
formulation is not extensive, even for the current extrapolation. A total of 751 subjects (363 
RA patients, 79 CD patients, 74 UC patients and 235 healthy subjects) have received at least 
one dose of CT-P13 SC and of them 249 have been treated for up to week 54, that is, for up 
to a year, and a further 277 patients for a shorter duration of time; among them 201 patients 
(155 RA, 24 CD and 22 UC patients) receiving the sought dose of 120 mg of CT-P13 SC for up 
to a year (for full details see Table 36 of this AR).
longer-term safety of Remsima SC beyond the 54 weeks remains yet unknown
scarcity  of  data  on  treatment  with  SC  formulation  in  the  absence  of  immunosuppressive  co-
medication
In this setting a robust post marketing plan is a prerequisite. The post-marketing plan including two 
placebo-controlled long-term maintenance studies (one in CD-patients and one in UC-patients), as well 
as an observational study in AS, PsA and Ps-patients, together with the already agreed observational 
RA-study, is considered sufficient (see RMP part of this AR) to address these uncertainties, provided 
that the protocol is agreed with the PRAC. Overall, considering the strength of the prior safety data, 
overall the quality of data, similarity and consistency of the Remsima SC safety findings, over 
indications and between the two formulations (excluding the elevated incidence of localised ISRs), the 
accrued Remsima SC safety data is considered to be adequate and sufficient and supports the 
currently proposed extrapolation.

2.7.  Update of the Product information
Extension of indication of the subcutaneous formulation of Remsima, to add treatment of adult patients 
with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis in line 
with the adult indications of the IV formulation; consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC and relevant sections of the Package leaflet are updated. An updated RMP (version 
12.2) has also been submitted. 
.
2.7.1.  User consultation
The MAH conducted a bridging analysis and a separate focus test to confirm the readability of Remsima 
120 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe PL including new therapeutic indications (AS, PsA, Ps, 
CD, and UC). Since the readability of the PFS-S PL with RA indication has already been established in 
2019 (EMEA/H/C/002576/X0062), the MAH conducted a focus test targeting the adapted parts of the 
leaflet only. The focus test included 4 questions and altogether 20 respondents (aged 18-65) took part 
in two testing rounds. In the first test round, all four questions met the predefined success criteria on 
finding and understanding. The second test round confirmed the positive results of the first test round 
and thus, no amendments were made in the Remsima PL.The results of the user consultation with 
target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH show that the package leaflet 
meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
The current approved indication in the EU for Remsima SC is for adult RA patients as follows: 
Remsima, following an initial dose of two intravenous infusions of infliximab, is indicated for the 
following conditions:
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 139/157
Rheumatoid arthritis
Remsima, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as 
well as the improvement in physical function in: 
-
-
adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate. 
adult  patients  with  severe,  active  and  progressive  disease  not  previously  treated  with 
methotrexate or other DMARDs. 
With this Type II variation application, the MAH seeks to extend the use of the SC formulation of 
Remsima to the treatment of adult patients with CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps as follows:
Adult Crohn’s disease
Remsima is indicated for:
-
treatment  of  moderately  to  severely  active  Crohn’s  disease,  in  adult  patients  who  have  not 
responded  despite  a  full  and  adequate  course  of  therapy  with  a  corticosteroid  and/or  an 
immunosuppressant;  or  who  are  intolerant  to  or  have  medical  contraindications  for  such 
therapies. 
-
treatment  of  fistulising,  active  Crohn’s  disease,  in  adult  patients  who  have  not  responded 
despite  a  full  and  adequate  course  of  therapy  with  conventional  treatment  (including 
antibiotics, drainage and immunosuppressive therapy).
Adult Ulcerative colitis
Remsima is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies.
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Remsima is indicated for treatment of severe, active ankylosing spondylitis, in adult patients who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy.
Psoriatic arthritis
Remsima is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when 
the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate.
Remsima should be administered in combination with methotrexate or alone in patients who show 
intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is contraindicated.
Psoriasis
Remsima is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed 
to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including 
cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralen ultra-violet A (PUVA).
No paediatric indications are proposed for CT-P13 SC in this application. The proposed indications are 
all approved for Remsima IV. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 140/157
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
There are several medicinal products containing infliximab for intravenous infusion on the market. 
However, the subcutaneously administered infliximab is so far available only for RA patients. Several 
other TNFα inhibitors are available in SC formulation for the sought indications. Thus, this application 
does not address any unmet need.
The availability of a SC formulation of infliximab would increase the treatment options available to 
patients, facilitate administration and add convenience. Potential benefits of SC administration include 
also optimisation of medical resources.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
Patient studies:
a) In RA patients (already an approved indication); Study CT-P13 3.5:  
This was a multi-dose, randomised, controlled, parallel group, 54-week study to evaluate PK, efficacy 
and safety of CT-P13 SC in RA patients. Part 1 of the study was open label, Part 2 was double-blinded.
Part 1 was conducted to determine the optimal dose of CT-P13 SC in 48 RA patients based on PK-
data, whereas Part 2 was performed to establish therapeutic non-inferiority (based on clinical efficacy) 
of CT-P13 SC compared with CT-P13 IV in 348 RA patients. 
Part 1 of study CT-P13 3.5 was the RA dose finding study. It was an open-label study that compared 
CT-P13 SC (in 3 different dose levels; 90, 120 and 180 mg at week 6 and then every 2 weeks) and CT-
P13 IV (3 mg/kg at week 6 and then every 8 weeks) when co-administered with MTX in patients with 
active RA who were not adequately responding to MTX. Efficacy results from this open label study 
showed non-inferior efficacy for all dose levels compared to Remsima IV 3mg/kg up to week 54. 
Part 2 of study CT-P13 3.5 was the pivotal clinical study in RA patients. The primary objective of CT-
P13 3.5 Part 2 was to demonstrate that CT-P13 SC (120 mg at week 6 and then every 2 weeks) is 
non-inferior to CT-P13 IV (3 mg/kg at week 6 and then every 8 weeks) at Week 22, in terms of 
efficacy, as determined by clinical response according to change from baseline in disease activity as 
measured by Disease Activity Score using DAS28 (CRP). Overall, the study was a randomized, parallel 
group, Phase I/III study, in which CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV were compared when co-administered 
with MTX in patients with active RA who were not adequately responding to MTX. This pivotal trial 
comprised 167 patients in the Remsima SC 120mg treatment arm and 176 patients in the Remsima IV 
3mg/kg treatment arm. All enrolled patients initially received Remsima IV 3mg/kg infusion at Weeks 0 
and 2.
b) In IBD patients (sought indication): Study CT-P13 1.6: 
This was a multi-dose, randomised, controlled, parallel group, 54-week study to evaluate PK, efficacy 
and safety of CT-P13 SC in IBD patients. Both parts of the study were open-label.
Part 1 was conducted to find the optimal dose of CT-P13 SC in 44 CD patients (no UC patients 
included) based on PK-data, while Part 2 was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for PK of CT-
P13 SC compared to CT-P13 IV in 130 patients. 
Part 1 of study CT-P13 1.6 was the IBD dose finding study. The study was an open-label phase I 
study that compared CT-P13 SC (in three different dose-levels; 120 mg, 180 mg, and 240 mg at week 
6 and then every 2 weeks) and CT-P13 IV (5 mg/kg at week 6 and then every eight weeks, dose 
escalation to 10 mg/kg allowed) in patients with active CD. The study included a dose-loading phase 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 141/157
during which all enrolled patients initially received a 2-hour CT-P13 IV infusion at Weeks 0 and 2. The 
selected SC posology did not perform consistently weaker than the approved IV dose.
In Part 2 of study CT-P13 1.6 the primary objective was to demonstrate that CT-P13 SC 120mg Q2W 
is non-inferior to CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg Q8W in terms of PK, as determined by the Ctrough, week 22 (pre-dose 
level at Week 22) in IBD patients. The study included 53 CD patients with moderate disease activity 
(CDAI score  between 220 to 450 points; fistulising CD patients were not included) who had not 
responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant; or were intolerant to or had medical contraindications for such therapies, and 78 
UC patients with moderate or severe disease activity (total Mayo score between 6 and 12 points with 
endoscopic evidence of active UC as indicated by endoscopic subscore of ≥ 2 points) who had not 
responded despite conventional therapy including corticosteroids alone or in combination with 6-MP or 
AZA and medications containing 5-ASA, or who were intolerant to or had medical contraindications for 
such therapies. All enrolled patients initially received Remsima IV 3mg/kg infusion at Weeks 0 and 2.
c) AS, Ps, PsA (sought indications)
The application does not include any clinical data from patients with AS, Ps or PsA. Approval is sought 
based on extrapolation.
Studies in healthy volunteers
Two studies in Healthy volunteers (CT-P13 1.5 and CT-P13 1.9) contribute with supportive safety and 
immunogenicity data.
3.2.  Favourable effects
The efficacy of Remsima IV was initially established in September 2013 as it was approved as a 
biosimilar product to Remicade (EMEA/H/C/002576). Following a line extension application 
(EMEA/H/C/002576/X/0062), the subcutaneous formulation (Remsima SC) was approved for treatment 
of RA. Notably, the originator Remicade does not have SC-formulation. 
Favourable effects in RA patients (Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2)
In summary, in RA patients the mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22 was 2.21 and 
1.94 in SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. The 2.2 point improvement in 
DAS28(CRP) score achieved with Remsima SC at week 22 and maintained over a period of 54 weeks is 
clinically relevant and the difference between SC and IV Remsima (in favour of SC) is neither clinically 
nor statistically significant. Hence, Remsima SC 120 mg is non-inferior to Remsima IV 3 mg/kg in RA-
patients with concomitant methotrexate use.
Favourable effects in IBD patients (Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2)
In patients with active non-fistulating, moderate CD or moderate to severe UC, not adequately 
responding to conventional treatment, the following favourable effects were seen:
The primary endpoint of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 was the observed serum infliximab pre-dose level at 
Week 22 (Ctrough,week22). The geometric LS means of observed Ctrough,week22 were 20.9844 and 1.8181 
μg/mL in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. The lower bound 90% CI 
for the ratio of the geometric LS means was 786.37%, which was greater than 80%, indicating non-
inferiority of Remsima SC 120/240 mg compared to Remsima IV 5 mg/kg.
Clinical efficacy in CD patients was similar between the studied treatment arms. CDAI-70 response was 
reached in 22 (78.6%) and 21 (84.0%) patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment 
arms, respectively by week 22 and in 19 (67.9%) and 17 (68.0%) patients, respectively, by week 30. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 142/157
Clinical remission (defined as an absolute CDAI score < 150 points) was reached in 57.1% and 60.0% 
in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively by week 22. 
Among patients who received the sought 120 mg dose of Remsima SC, response rate according to 
CDAI-70 at week 22 was 90% (n=18) and clinical remission was reached by 13/20 (65%) patients at 
week 22. Response remained comparable between treatment arms up to week 54, also after switching 
all patients to SC treatment at week 30.
All results on the secondary efficacy outcomes, as well as data from the small dose finding study 1.6 
Part 1, are in line and support the non-inferiority of CT-P13 SC.
The number of UC patients achieving clinical response by week 22 according to Partial Mayo score was 
32 (84.2%) and 30 (76.9%)in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. 
Among patients who received the sought 120 mg dose of Remsima SC, 22 (78.6%) achieved clinical 
response by week 22.
After switching to Remsima SC at Week 30 in the IV treatment arm, the response rates according to 
Partial Mayo score persisted and were similar between the two studied treatment arms at Week 54 (31 
[81.6%] and 28 [71.8%] in the SC and IV treatment arms, respectively). At week 54, response was 
reached by 22 (78.6%) among those UC patients who received the sought dose of 120 mg Remsima 
SC.
Since the need for concomitant corticosteroids was not imputed in the outcome estimands, this can be 
considered as an independent indicator of treatment response. At baseline, CD patients in the SC arm 
were similar to those in the IV arm in terms of disease activity and corticosteroid use. During the 
study, the use of corticosteroids increased in both treatment arms (probably due to intensified care, 
because of participation in the study), but during the maintenance phase the use of corticosteroids for 
systemic use was more common in the IV arm. 
Also, UC patients were similar at baseline in terms of disease activity and medication. The use of 
antidiarrheal, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents increased in a similar manner in both 
treatment arms. However, during the maintenance phase, the use of concomitant corticosteroids for 
systemic use was significantly more common among IV patients, while the use of corticosteroids was 
reduced in the SC arm. 
The reduced need for corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medication in the SC arm compared 
to the IV arm during the maintenance phase supports the conclusion of non-inferior efficacy for 
Remsima SC.
The provided data supports non-inferiority of Remsima SC 120/240 mg and 120mg compared to 
Remsima IV 5 mg/kg in CD and UC patients in terms of response and remission rates, before switching 
of treatment at week 30 and after switching up to week 54. 
The proposed posology in IBD indications is 120 mg SC Q2W for all patients regardless of body weight; 
therefore, Ctrough in subjects with body weight ≥80 kg will be lower than that observed in study 1.6 
Part 2 but still several folds higher than with the approved Remsima IV posology. Simulations using 
the PPK model indicated that infliximab Ctrough,ss of infliximab 120 mg SC Q2W was 2.63~10.62-fold 
higher than the Ctrough,ss of infliximab 5 mg/kg IV Q8W over weight from 50 kg to 150 kg, the 
difference decreasing with high body weights. As it is believed that Ctrough is the most important 
parameter in relation to effect, maintaining a Ctrough above > 5 μg/mL (and above the concentration 
seen with approved posology of Remsima IV) should be enough to ensure efficacy of Remsima SC 
120mg in all IBD patients. The relatively lower AUC8W,ss observed in heavier patients receiving 
Remsima SC 120 mg did not impact efficacy outcomes. Hence, the proposed posology of 120 mg 
regardless of body weight is considered appropriate by CHMP.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The efficacy of Remsima SC was not studied in As, PsA and Ps indications. Hence, the assessment of 
efficacy in these indications is based on extrapolation.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Unfavourable effects for infliximab
In general, unfavourable effects associated with the use of TNF-blockers that have been reported for 
infliximab (Remsima SmPC), also apply for Remsima SC with the exception of acute infusion reactions 
(as no infusion is given). However, the risk of administration related reactions (including 
hypersensitivity) exist. The most serious ADRs with infliximab include the following: SC hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) reactivation, congestive heart failure (CHF), serious infections (including sepsis, 
opportunistic infections and tuberculosis [TB]), serious infusion reactions, serum sickness (delayed 
hypersensitivity), haematologic reactions, systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus like syndrome, 
demyelinating disorders, hepatobiliary events, malignancies including lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell 
lymphoma (HSTCL), leukaemia, Merkel cell carcinoma, melanoma, paediatric malignancy, 
sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reaction.
Unfavourable effects in RA patients (Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2). Indication already approved.
In summary, during the Maintenance Phase of the pivotal RA study, TEAEs were, in all, reported for 
117 (66.9%) and 92 (54.8%) IV and SC patients, respectively. The most common TEAE being localised 
ISR (IV 3 mg/kg: 12.6% vs. SC 120 mg: 17.9%). The majority of the events in both treatment arms 
were grade 1 or 2 in severity; number of grade 3 or higher TEAEs being alike in the 2 treatment arms. 
SAE were reported for 13 (7.4%) and 6 (3.6%) and TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, for 
14 (8.0%) and 6 (3.6%) patients in the IV 3 mg/kg and SC 120 mg arms, respectively. ARR during the 
treatment period were reported for 2 (1.2%) patients in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 10 (5.7%) 
patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. No increased safety concerns related to higher drug 
concentrations in SC patients were seen. The MAH conducted a comprehensive investigation on all five 
death cases and found no trend in regard to the PK parameters or immunogenicity and the incidence 
rate of death was within the range of reported rates from historical study. Overall, the safety profile of 
Remsima SC, in the proposed dose range, in RA patients, did not appear consistently worse than 
Remsima IV, with one notable exception: the proportion of patients that reported a TEAE classified as 
localised ISR, was generally higher in the SC group.
Unfavourable effects in IBD patients (Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 2) - the current application
According to the safety results of the study CT-P13 1.6 part 2, the proportions of patients with at least 
one TEAE, TESAE, TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug or TEAE classified as ARR (IRR, SIR 
and delayed hypersensitivity reactions) were no higher in the SC group compared to the IV group. The 
respective numbers for infections were also similar between the groups, 24 (36.4%) in the SC and 20 
(30.8%) in the treatment arms. The proportion of patients that reported localised injection site 
reaction (ISR) was notably higher in the SC group 15 (22.7%) vs 3 (4.6). This was the single notable 
finding among otherwise comparable safety data between treatment arms was the higher proportion of 
patients that reported localised ISR in the SC group. This pattern was also seen in the pivotal data on 
RA patients. 
When analysing the safety data for TEAEs reported for at least 5% of patients, the incidence rates 
were slightly different. However, the MAH clarified acceptably that infections, anaemia, neutropenia 
and gastrointestinal disorders are recognised TEAEs reported in clinical trials with infliximab and that 
these disparate findings can be explained by previous medical history or could even be regarded as 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 144/157
chance findings. It was concluded that the findings did not indicate new safety signals or issues for the 
SC formulation of CT-P13 SC. 
The requested analysis of the main safety data by body weight stratas (≥ 80 kg and < 80 kg) for both 
treatment arms showed (acknowledging the small numbers in some of the subgroups) no apparent 
correlation between body weight and the safety profiles, in either of the CT-P13 IV or SC treatment 
arms. 
Concerning SAE, there were no differences in the number of patients who experienced at least 1 
TESAE, 5 (7.6%) and 6 (9.2%) patients in the SC 120/240 mg and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, 
respectively. The TESAEs considered to be related to study drug were rare, solitary cases reported for 
1 (1.5%) patient (NSCLC) in the SC 120/240 mg and 2 (3.1%) patients (disseminated TB and 
bronchitis with cardiac decompensation) in the IV 5 mg/kg treatment arm, respectively. No differences 
were evident between the two CD and UC patient groups or when switching formulations. No deaths 
were reported during the study.
The TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug during the maintenance phase were 
reported for 1 (1.5%) and 3 (4.6%) patients in the SC 120/240 mg (NSCC) and IV 5 mg/kg treatment 
arms (NSCLC and IRR, psoriasis and disseminated TB), respectively, all considered related to the study 
drug. They were rare, solitary cases, of grade 2 or 3, no more numerous in patients treated with the 
SC, than with the IV formulations or those reported for the RA patients. Switching of treatment 
appeared not to associate with any of the discontinuations.  
The number of patients in total and the number with at least 1 TEAE classified as infection was similar 
between the 2 treatment arms 21 (31.8%) and 19 (29.2%) with the patients in the SC 120/240 mg 
and IV 5 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively. The most frequently reported were nasopharyngitis 
reported in 4 (6.1%) patients and 2 (3.1%) patients for the SC and IV arms, respectively. Infection 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were overall reported in 15 (11.5%) 
patients, and were largely not more numerous in the SC 9 (13.6%) than in the IV treatment arm 6 
(9.2%). Most of the events were of grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Findings were similar between the 
subgroups of CD and UC patients. Thus, infections were no more numerous in the SC than in the IV 
treatment arm, which is in line with the IV data. 
A single malignancy was reported in the study for one (1.5%) patient with CD in the SC 120/240 mg 
treatment arm (NSCLC, after week 50) judged possibly related to the treatment, but the current 
follow-up is too short for any conclusions.  
Over time, the changes from baseline in all clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and haematology laboratory 
parameters were generally small, and there were no notable differences between the two treatment 
arms. 
The SC formulation was not more immunogenic among patients who did not use concomitant 
immunosuppressive medication [19/37 (51.4%) in the SC arm and 25/36 (69.4%) in the IV arm were 
ADA positive at week 30]. Among patients who used concomitant immunosuppressive medication, the 
results from Study 1.6 Part 2 were in line with previous RA results and supported the notion that SC 
Remsima is not more immunogenic than IV Remsima. 
Infliximab is known to be very immunogenic (with 30% murine variable region amino acid sequence); 
a trait that is likely to be influenced by both use of immunosuppressants and the mode of 
administration (subcutaneous route often being more immunogenic) and it could have consequences 
for clinical safety, as well as efficacy. This, however, was not apparent in the IBD or RA patients on 
Remsima SC treatment. Overall ARR were rare. Moreover, this should be considered, acknowledging 
that the IV infliximab is administered in controlled clinical (hospital) setting, whereas, SC Remsima will 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 145/157
be used at home. However, while the present data on patients treated without CIM is limited, and only 
on a few CD/UC-patients, the results do not raise concerns regarding immunogenicity and safety in 
patients without concomitant methotrexate or other immunosuppressive medication. This is, because 
the rate of ADA positivity was comparable (or even lower) in the SC arm than in the IV arm, and ADA 
titres were comparable and the frequency of NAb was no higher in the SC arm, in spite of the new, 
more sensitive methodology. In addition, no apparent differences in the clinical consequences of ADA-
formation were evident between the IV and SC groups. Furthermore, the similar incidences of localized 
injection site reactions were comparable to those of other licensed SC TNFα-inhibitors, which are also 
used in the home-administration setting. Further data will be accrued in the post-approval 
pharmacovigilance programme. Thus, the use of Remsima SC also in the home-setting is considered 
acceptable.
The impact of immunosuppressant on the incidence of ARRs (including IRR, SIR and Delayed 
Hypersensitivity) and localised ISR was comparable between the Remsima IV 5 mg/kg and Remsima 
SC 120/ 240 mg arms.
Using the new ADA ECL ACE and NAb ECL ACE methods the immunogenicity results showed (study CT-
P13 1.6 Part 2) no clear associations of ADA status or titers and the rate of immune-mediated AEs 
(IRR, SIR, delayed hypersensitivity and localised ISR), TEAEs or TESAEs. The results were similar in RA 
patients (study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2). Overall, numbers were small and discrepant in some comparisons, 
thus firm conclusions cannot be drawn.
Hence, the present data, while limited, does not raise concerns regarding immunogenicity and safety in 
patients without concomitant methotrexate or other immunosuppressive medication. This supports the 
possibility of extrapolation of the data to the indications where patients use less MTX.
Overall, no unexpected findings were seen and the overall safety profile of the patients treated with SC 
was no worse compared to the IV arm, even after switching, and was overall comparable with the 
known safety profile of infliximab. The single notable finding among otherwise comparable safety data 
between treatment arms was the higher proportion of patients that reported localised ISR in the SC 
group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Thus far, no post-marketing experience on the treatment of patient with the SC formulation exists.
Up to tenfold higher Ctrough levels, compared to IV, are achieved when on the proposed Remsima SC 
120 mg Q2W posology. This is a safety concern, especially in long-term, beyond the current 54 week. 
Data on effects of this on patient safety, particularly concerning serious infections (including TB and 
other opportunistic infections) is still scarce, and as data on cancer is still unknown. So far, in short 
term and up to week 54, it appears that no clinically relevant, unexpected safety signals have been 
identified.
The overall exposure of the entire Remsima SC database is not extensive, especially considering the 
various indications applied for. A total of 751 subjects (363 RA patients, 79 CD patients, 74 UC 
patients and 235 healthy subjects) have received at least one dose of CT-P13 SC and of them 249 
have been treated for up to week 54, that is, for up to a year and a further 277 patients for a shorter 
duration of time; among them 201 patients (155 RA, 24 CD and 22 UC patients) receiving the sought 
dose of 120 mg of CT-P13 SC for up to a year (for full details see Table 36 of this AR).  However, it is 
considered adequate and sufficient for the current extrapolation purposes, with the sufficiently robust 
post marketing strategy being a prerequisite. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 146/157
Especially, data on treatment with the Remsima SC without immunosuppressive co-medication appears 
scarce, and thus calls for post-approval safety data. The MAH has, indeed, proposed to further 
evaluate the safety of Remsima SC in addition to patients with RA, also in patients with Ankylosing 
Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis. The planned post-authorisation safety study CT-P13 4.9 is 
an observational, prospective cohort study, planned to include 576 patients (288 patients in each 
treatment group of Remsima IV and SC) who will be followed up for 24 months. In addition, two other 
placebo-controlled long-term maintenance studies, one in CD and one in UC patients have been 
planned. Overall, this post-approval PhV-programme is robust enough, also from the safety point of 
view. The final PhV-programme is agreed on with the PRAC.
The results of the analysis of the relationship between ADA-status and clinical safety outcome in study 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 up to week 54 showed no associations of ADA-status with the AE rates, including 
those of infections or hypersensitivity reactions. However, numbers in some comparisons were too 
small for firm conclusions.
To summarize, the uncertainties with regards to the unfavourable effects pertain mainly to the fact 
that there is still relatively limited safety data, especially considering the several applied for indications 
without any clinical data, and to the sufficiency of the overall data for current extrapolation purposes.  
To address these uncertainties, a robust post approval strategy has been proposed which is considered 
adequate by CHMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Although the SC infliximab is not fulfilling any unmet medical need, as such, a SC formulation of 
infliximab has significant practical advantages over the current IV formulation. IV administration of 
infliximab takes place in hospitals and outpatient clinics. The use of the IV formulation causes both 
administrative burden for hospitals and inconvenience to patients that could be avoided by a 
formulation intended for SC administration. Self-administration of SC infliximab allows greater 
flexibility and ability for home use, which usually affects the quality of life of patients. The fixed dose 
approach is simple and practical and may reduce the risk of medication errors. Further, from the 
medical point of view, one benefit of the SC route of administration is that it does not require an IV 
access after the initial IV loading doses, which is especially important for patients with poor venous 
access. The shorter administration time is also a benefit for patients. In general, the efficacy of 
infliximab IV is well established. The efficacy of Remsima SC 120 mg has been compared to earlier 
approved Remsima IV and shown to be non-inferior to Remsima IV 3mg/kg in RA patients.
The provided data, including PK, PK-modelling and clinical efficacy and safety data, in IBD patients, 
supports non-inferiority of Remsima SC 120mg to Remsima IV 5 mg/kg also in CD and UC patients.
In general, the safety profile of infliximab IV is well established. However, after SC administration, 
especially the long-term, safety data is not extensive and safety data beyond the week 54 is missing. 
To date, a total of 751 subjects have received at least one dose of CT-P13 SC and of them 249 have 
been treated for up to a year. Based on the currently available safety database, the safety profile for 
Remsima SC and IV were in general comparable and only a few rare cases of SAEs were reported and 
ARR were rare. There were no unexpected unfavourable effects, and importantly immunogenicity was 
also comparable between the products. Furthermore, no deaths were reported in this study.
The single new TEAE, compared to IV Remsima, in study CT-P13 1.6 part 2, after SC dosing was local 
injections site reactions, which are common for SC dosing in general and also seen for Remsima SC in 
RA-indication. In all, the localised ISRs in the SC arm were all mild or moderate in severity and all 
manageable. Furthermore, this is not an unexpected event and implications for the B/R balance of this 
known risk, given the change in treatment setting (self-administration at home), have to be 
considered. However, a comparison of the incidence of patients with localised ISR has previously been 
conducted by the MAH (on data from study CT-P13 3.5 and from literature), to other licensed SC 
TNFα-inhibitors. It showed that the incidences of local injection site reactions were comparable to other 
licensed TNFα-inhibitors, which are used in the home-administration setting.
In spite of the apparent similarity and consistency of the Remsima SC safety findings compared to 
Remsima IV safety data and Remsima SC data in RA-indication, some uncertainties of the SC safety 
data remain, mainly related to up to tenfold higher Ctrough levels with the SC 120mg posology 
compared to patients in AS, PsA and Ps-patients, in addition to long-term placebo-controlled 
maintenance studies in CD and UC-patients. This programme is considered adequate by CHMP.
Extrapolation of efficacy and safety to other indications 
The indications sought, but not studied are Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and 
Psoriasis (Ps). Patients in these populations are generally younger, with less comorbidities and less 
concomitant medications than RA patients (the main source of efficacy and safety data for Remsima 
SC), in particular, the difference in use of IV and the impact of this in long-term use. From the safety 
point of view, the accrued Remsima SC safety data are considered supportive of the currently 
proposed extrapolation, from the source populations (RA and IBD) to the indications not studied (AS, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 150/157
Ps and PsA), provided that, in light of the still existing uncertainties, an adequate and sufficiently 
robust post authorisation plan, also addressing the remaining SC safety concerns, will be set in place.
The MAH has proposed to further evaluate the safety of Remsima SC, in addition to patients with RA, 
also in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis. The planned post-
authorisation safety study CT-P13 SC 4.9 is an observational, prospective cohort study, planned to 
include 576 patients (288 patients in each treatment group of Remsima IV and SC) who will be 
followed up for 24 months. In addition, two other placebo-controlled long-term maintenance studies, 
one in CD and one in UC patients have been planned. Overall, this post-approval PhV-programme 
seems robust enough, also from the safety point of view.  .
The approved posology for Remsima IV in the indications As, PsA and Ps is the same as the posology 
for IBD, that is, 5mg/kg Q8W after loading. The proposed posology is 120 mg SC Q2W after loading, 
for all indications.
In CHMP Scientific Advice, the mechanism of action for infliximab was judged sufficiently similar within 
the IBD and AS-PsA-Ps-clusters, in spite of other possible modes of action (judged secondary). 
Therefore, the proposed clinical Remsima SC database was seen as sufficient to justify extrapolation 
for all indications currently approved for Remsima IV. It was noted that if the therapeutic equivalence 
could be demonstrated in the RA setting, and PK data from an IBD population would show similar 
exposure and Ctrough levels between SC and IV formulations, full extrapolation to other indications, 
should be possible, given that SC dosing and regimen schedules for both the rheumatology and IBD 
indications are identified and the dosing in the AS-PsA-Ps-cluster is the same as in IBD. However, it 
was possibly not entirely clear at the time of the central CHMP scientific advice that approximately half 
of the studied IBD-population (in addition to all RA-patients) would be treated with concomitant 
immunosuppressants, as it was stated in the CHMP Advice dated September 2016 that ‘the study is 
planned in IBD patients with minimal background immunomodulatory therapy’.
With the current data, therapeutic equivalence has been demonstrated between Remsima SC 120 mg 
and Remsima IV 3 mg/kg in the RA setting.  In addition, similar exposure and non-inferior Ctrough levels 
were demonstrated with Remsima SC 120 mg compared to Remsima IV 5 mg /kg in an IBD 
population. With the proposed posology, the mean Ctrough levels observed in both RA patients (study 
CT-P13 3.5 Part 2) and IBD patients (study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and Part 2) were well above the target 
levels in all weight bands. 
Results from study CT-P13 1.1 performed by the MAH in AS patients and review of the published 
literature indicate that infliximab trough concentrations are associated with clinical response in AS, PsA 
and Ps. While it is difficult to estimate a specific target Ctrough, an average Ctrough of approximately 5 
µg/mL in patients with AS, PsA and Ps seems likely to be associated with clinical efficacy. Of note, this 
threshold for efficacy is often in fact not met with the currently approved IV dosing and the proportion 
of patients who achieved the target Ctrough 5 µg/mL was larger with SC 120 mg dosing than with IV 
5mg/kg dosing in IBD patients. Since it is known that the IV dose is efficacious, it is expected that the 
proposed posology for the indications AS, PsA and Ps would result in a similar effect, if the same drug 
concentrations are achieved.
As stated above, patients with As, PsA and Ps generally use less CIM than RA patients, which could 
affect the formation of ADA, namely a lower immunosuppression could give rise to more ADA 
formation. This, in turn, could potentially increase clearance and decrease drug exposure in As, PsA 
and Ps patients. However, data from study CT-P13 1.6 in IBD patients showed that Ctrough remained 
clearly higher with Remsima SC 120mg than with Remsima IV 5 mg/kg, even in patients without CIM 
and with positive NAb status. Hence, it is expected that the drug exposure in patients with AS, PsA and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 151/157
Ps will be sufficient. It has even been postulated in the published literature that infliximab 
concentrations in AS and PsA patients could be somewhat higher than in RA patients.
The lesser use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication and following higher formation of ADA 
could also affect safety. Overall, based on the historical literature and immunogenicity data from CT-
P13 IV/SC trials in RA and IBD patients, the results show that the concomitant use of 
immunosuppressant medication is correlated with a reduced ADA incidence rate. However, based on 
study CT-P13 1.6, the use of CIM did not shift the relative immunogenicity between formulations. 
Among patients who did not use CIM, 19/37 (51.4%) in the SC arm and 25/36 (69.4%) in the IV arm 
were ADA positive at week 30. These results supported the notion that the SC formulation is not more 
immunogenic in either users or non-users of CIM. The impact of immunosuppressant on the incidence 
of ARRs (including IRR, SIR and Delayed Hypersensitivity) and localised ISR was also comparable 
between the two formulations with no more incidences of localised ISR among non-users than users of 
CIM.
Overall safety was also comparable between SC and IV treatment arms in the IBD setting and 
incidence rates for infections, ARRs and other AEs were in line with previous findings in RA patients. 
Hence, while the present data on patients treated without CIM is limited, the available data do not 
raise concerns regarding immunogenicity and safety in patients without concomitant methotrexate or 
other immunosuppressive medication. This supports the validity of extrapolation of the data to the 
indications where use of CIM is less common than in RA. Moreover, further safety data in AS, PsA and 
Ps indications will be accrued in the post-approval pharmacovigilance programme. 
Hence, considering the strength of the prior safety data, the overall quality of data, similarity and 
consistency of the Remsima SC safety findings, over indications and between the two formulations 
(excluding the elevated incidence of localised ISRs), the accrued Remsima SC safety data is considered 
by CHMP to support the currently proposed extrapolation also from the safety and efficacy point of 
view,. 
Thus, the use of Remsima SC is considered acceptable to the CHMP, with the proposed posology in all 
the sought indications and also in the home-setting.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
In general, the efficacy and safety profile of infliximab IV is well established. The efficacy and safety of 
Remsima SC was demonstrated to be non-inferior to that of IV Remsima in RA patients with a 120mg 
Q2W dosing and line extension in this indication was approved in 2019. In RA patients, the exposure to 
infliximab was somewhat higher with Remsima SC 120mg Q2W than with Remsima IV Q8W 3mg/kg, 
but this high exposure did not translate into a higher risk for infections or other adverse events, 
excepting higher localised ISR. However, the number of patients (157) exposed to long term treatment 
with Remsima SC was limited and some uncertainty remained regarding the effect of higher Ctrough 
levels of infliximab on the potential risk of some rare adverse events (for example, infections, 
malignancies and cardiac AEs). This was considered acceptable to the CHMP since the MAH committed 
to a post-approval PV programme (including a non-interventional study in patients with RA).
This indication extension variation focused on demonstrating comparable PK, efficacy and safety 
between Remsima SC and Remsima IV in CD and UC indications, resulting in the possibility to 
extrapolate efficacy and safety to the rest of the sought indications (AS, PsA, Ps). The main concerns 
in relation to the new proposed indications (CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps) was the dosing and the possibility 
of higher immunogenicity due to a lower rate of MTX or other concomitant immunosuppressants in 
these populations. It was agreed through multiple central Scientific Advices (January 2016, September 
2016, December 2017, April 2018) that: if non-inferior efficacy could be demonstrated in the RA 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 152/157
setting, and PK data from an IBD population would show similar exposure and Ctrough levels between 
SC and IV formulations, full extrapolation to other indications should be possible given that SC dosing 
and regimen schedules for both the rheumatology and the IBD indications were identified.
The data presented within this application confirmed that Ctrough will be several folds higher with the 
proposed 120mg posology of Remsima SC than with the approved Remsima IV posology across all 
weight bands, also in IBD patients. Thus, the main premise for ensuring non-inferior efficacy in all 
patients was fulfilled. The initial uncertainty pertaining to comparability of exposure in terms of AUC 
was clarified by the MAH. Although up to 48% lower AUC was predicted in some patients treated with 
Remsima SC 120 mg, subgroup analyses showed no indication of decreasing efficacy of Remsima SC in 
relation to lower AUC.
Also efficacy data support non-inferiority in both CD and UC patients, with clinically meaningful 
response rates in both treatment arms. 
The clearly higher Ctrough drug concentrations during SC administration did not seem to translate into a 
higher risk for infections or other adverse events, excepting higher localised ISR. The safety profiles for 
SC and IV were in general comparable. The only new unfavourable effect identified after SC dosing 
were localised injection site reactions (ISR), which were observed in 22.7% of patients in the SC arm 
and were all mild or moderate in severity and all manageable. In addition, immunogenicity was 
comparable between SC and IV formulations (if anything, immunogenicity was lower in SC group). 
Exploratory graphical PK/PD analyses for safety did not suggest strong associations between exposure 
and IRR and infections. The results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited number of events in 
patients treated with the SC formulation.
The overall safety profile of the IBD patients treated with Remsima 120mg Q2W SC was no worse 
compared to Remsima IV, even after switching, and comparable with the known safety profile of 
infliximab. Infliximab is known to be immunogenic, however, administration related reactions, 
including infusion-related reactions, systemic injection reactions and delayed hypersensitivity reactions 
were, overall, rare and the incidences similar between the two treatment arms and similar, or even 
lower, to those in the pivotal RA study. The single notable finding among otherwise comparable safety 
data between two treatment arms was the higher proportion of patients that reported localised ISR in 
the SC group. The rates were, however, comparable to rates for other licenced SC TNFα-inhibitors, 
which are also used in the home-administration setting. Apart from this, the safety profile of Remsima 
SC appears to be quite consistently similar to the previously described data, and thus provides grounds 
for extrapolation of safety. 
The impact of concomitant immunosuppressive medication (CIM) on immunogenicity was comparable 
between treatment arms and the SC formulation was non-inferior to IV in both users and non-users of 
CIM in terms of both ADA formation, and safety (including hypersensitivity reactions). The formation of 
ADAs, also in relation to the number of adverse events was similar to that observed in previous trials 
with infliximab. The data did not sustain any previous concerns regarding the effect of MTX or other 
CIM on the safety of Remsima SC. However, the number of patients treated without CIM is still very 
limited and safety in this subpopulation needs to be followed-up in a post-approval PhV programme. 
Extrapolation of the results to indications not studied is considered approvable, as all other concerns in 
this AR are resolved.
Ctrough was reasoned to be the most important parameter in relation to efficacy. Maintaining a Ctrough 
substantially higher than the concentration seen with approved posology of Remsima IV should be 
enough to ensure efficacy of Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W in all patients. Hence, the proposed posology 
of 120 mg regardless of body weight is considered acceptable for all patients in all indications as 
satisfactory responses to the RSI have been provided. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/376884/2020 
Page 153/157
The MAH’s initial proposal to recommend a dose escalation in case of loss of response, and thus 
allowing a dose of 240 mg Remsima SC to be administered to all patients, including those with a body 
weight <80 kg, is not supported by sufficient evidence. Additional efficacy and sufficient safety of 
240mg SC, especially for patients weighing <80 kg, have not been confirmed. Of note, IV Remsima 
and IV Remicade do not have this dose increase possibility stated for UC in the SmPC. Therefore, it is 
not possible to include such an option for Remsima SC in this indication without robust clinical data. 
The proposal for dose escalation was withdrawn by the MAH.
Based on these considerations, the data provided, the benefit/risk balance is positive for the use of 
Remsima SC in adult patients with CD, UC, AS, PsA and Ps.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Remsima SC is positive.

Reminders to the MAH
1.
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature.
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification 
by 10 July 2020. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-
agencies/european-medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-
confidential-information_en.pdf.
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” 
and with detailed justification by 10 July 2020. We would like to remind you that, according to 
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal 
data’ means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data 
subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in 
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an 
online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, 
economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that 
the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of 
additional information (e.g. key-coded data). 
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass 
for instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.”

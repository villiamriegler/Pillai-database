CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults. 
For the paediatric population: sugammadex is only recommended for routine reversal of rocuronium 
induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Sugammadex should only be administered by, or under the supervision of an anaesthetist. 
The use of an appropriate neuromuscular monitoring technique is recommended to monitor the 
recovery of neuromuscular blockade (see section 4.4). 
The recommended dose of sugammadex depends on the level of neuromuscular blockade to be 
reversed. 
The recommended dose does not depend on the anaesthetic regimen. 
Sugammadex can be used to reverse different levels of rocuronium or vecuronium induced 
neuromuscular blockade: 
Adults 
Routine reversal: 
A dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended if recovery has reached at least 1-2 post-tetanic 
counts (PTC) following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade. Median time to recovery of the 
T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 is around 3 minutes (see section 5.1). 
A dose of 2 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended, if spontaneous recovery has occurred up to at least 
the reappearance of T2 following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade. Median time to 
recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 is around 2 minutes (see section 5.1). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using the recommended doses for routine reversal will result in a slightly faster median time to 
recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 of rocuronium when compared to vecuronium induced 
neuromuscular blockade (see section 5.1). 
Immediate reversal of rocuronium-induced blockade: 
If there is a clinical need for immediate reversal following administration of rocuronium a dose of 
16 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended. When 16 mg/kg sugammadex is administered 3 minutes after 
a bolus dose of 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium bromide, a median time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 of 
approximately 1.5 minutes can be expected (see section 5.1). 
There is no data to recommend the use of sugammadex for immediate reversal following vecuronium 
induced blockade. 
Re-administration of sugammadex: 
In the exceptional situation of recurrence of neuromuscular blockade post-operatively (see section 4.4) 
after an initial dose of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex, a repeat dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex is 
recommended. Following a second dose of sugammadex, the patient should be closely monitored to 
ascertain sustained return of neuromuscular function. 
Re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after sugammadex: 
For waiting times for re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after reversal with sugammadex, 
see section 4.4. 
Additional information on special population 
Renal impairment: 
The use of sugammadex in patients with severe renal impairment (including patients requiring dialysis 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min)) is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Studies in patients with severe renal impairment do not provide sufficient safety information to 
support the use of sugammadex in these patients (see also section 5.1). 
For mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 and < 80 mL/min): the dose 
recommendations are the same as for adults without renal impairment. 
Elderly patients: 
After administration of sugammadex at reappearance of T2 following a rocuronium induced blockade, 
the median time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 in adults (18-64 years) was 2.2 minutes, in elderly 
adults (65-74 years) it was 2.6 minutes and in very elderly adults (75 years or more) it was 
3.6 minutes. Even though the recovery times in elderly tend to be slower, the same dose 
recommendation as for adults should be followed (see section 4.4). 
Obese patients: 
In obese patients, including morbidly obese patients (body mass index  40 kg/m2), the dose of 
sugammadex should be based on actual body weight. The same dose recommendations as for adults 
should be followed. 
Hepatic impairment: 
Studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Caution should be exercised 
when considering the use of sugammadex in patients with severe hepatic impairment or when hepatic 
impairment is accompanied by coagulopathy (see section 4.4). 
For mild to moderate hepatic impairment: as sugammadex is mainly excreted renally no dose 
adjustments are required.

Paediatric population 
Children and adolescents (2-17 years): 
Sugammadex Mylan 100 mg/mL may be diluted to 10 mg/mL to increase the accuracy of dosing in 
the paediatric population (see section 6.6). 
Routine reversal: 
A dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended for reversal of rocuronium induced blockade if 
recovery has reached at least 1-2 PTC. 
A dose of 2 mg/kg is recommended for reversal of rocuronium induced blockade at reappearance of T2 
(see section 5.1). 
Immediate reversal: 
Immediate reversal in children and adolescents has not been investigated. 
Term newborn infants and infants: 
There is only limited experience with the use of sugammadex in infants (30 days to 2 years), and term 
newborn infants (less than 30 days) have not been studied. The use of sugammadex in term newborn 
infants and infants is therefore not recommended until further data become available. 
Method of administration 
Sugammadex should be administered intravenously as a single bolus injection. The bolus injection 
should be given rapidly, within 10 seconds, into an existing intravenous line (see section 6.6). 
Sugammadex has only been administered as a single bolus injection in clinical trials. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
As is normal post-anaesthetic practice following neuromuscular blockade, it is recommended to 
monitor the patient in the immediate post-operative period for untoward events including recurrence of 
neuromuscular blockade. 
Monitoring respiratory function during recovery: 
Ventilatory support is mandatory for patients until adequate spontaneous respiration is restored 
following reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Even if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is 
complete, other medicinal products used in the peri- and post-operative period could depress 
respiratory function and therefore ventilatory support might still be required. 
Should neuromuscular blockade reoccur following extubation, adequate ventilation should be 
provided. 
Recurrence of neuromuscular blockade: 
In clinical studies with subjects treated with rocuronium or vecuronium, where sugammadex was 
administered using a dose labelled for the depth of neuromuscular blockade, an incidence of 0.20% 
was observed for recurrence of neuromuscular blockade as based on neuromuscular monitoring or 
clinical evidence. The use of lower than recommended doses may lead to an increased risk of 
recurrence of neuromuscular blockade after initial reversal and is not recommended (see section 4.2 
and section 4.8). 
Effect on haemostasis: 
In a study in volunteers doses of 4 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of sugammadex resulted in maximum mean 
prolongations of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) by 17 and 22% respectively and 
prothrombin time international normalised ratio [PT(INR)] by 11 and 22% respectively. These limited 
mean aPTT and PT(INR) prolongations were of short duration (≤ 30 minutes). Based on the clinical 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data-base (N=3,519) and on a specific study in 1184 patients undergoing hip fracture/major joint 
replacement surgery there was no clinically relevant effect of sugammadex 4 mg/kg alone or in 
combination with anticoagulants on the incidence of peri- or post-operative bleeding complications. 
In in vitro experiments a pharmacodynamic interaction (aPTT and PT prolongation) was noted with 
vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparinoids, rivaroxaban and 
dabigatran. In patients receiving routine post-operative prophylactic anticoagulation this 
pharmacodynamic interaction is not clinically relevant. Caution should be exercised when considering 
the use of sugammadex in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for a pre-existing or comorbid 
condition. 
with hereditary vitamin K dependent clotting factor deficiencies; 
with pre-existing coagulopathies; 
on coumarin derivates and at an INR above 3.5; 
using anticoagulants who receive a dose of 16 mg/kg sugammadex. 
An increased risk of bleeding cannot be excluded in patients: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If there is a medical need to give sugammadex to these patients the anaesthesiologist needs to decide if 
the benefits outweigh the possible risk of bleeding complications taking into consideration the patients 
history of bleeding episodes and type of surgery scheduled. If sugammadex is administered to these 
patients monitoring of haemostasis and coagulation parameters is recommended. 
Waiting times for re-administration with neuromuscular blocking agents after reversal with 
sugammadex: 
Table 1: Re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after routine reversal (up to 4 mg/kg 
sugammadex): 
Minimum waiting time 
5 minutes 
4 hours 
NMBA and dose to be administered 
1.2 mg/kg rocuronium 
0.6 mg/kg rocuronium or 
0.1 mg/kg vecuronium 
The onset of neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged up to approximately 4 minutes, and the 
duration of neuromuscular blockade may be shortened up to approximately 15 minutes after re-
administration of rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg within 30 minutes after sugammadex administration. 
Based on PK modelling the recommended waiting time in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment for re-use of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium or 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium after routine reversal with 
sugammadex should be 24 hours. If a shorter waiting time is required, the rocuronium dose for a new 
neuromuscular blockade should be 1.2 mg/kg. 
Re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after immediate reversal (16 mg/kg sugammadex): 
For the very rare cases where this might be required, a waiting time of 24 hours is suggested. 
If neuromuscular blockade is required before the recommended waiting time has passed, a 
nonsteroidal neuromuscular blocking agent should be used. The onset of a depolarizing 
neuromuscular blocking agent might be slower than expected, because a substantial fraction of 
postjunctional nicotinic receptors can still be occupied by the neuromuscular blocking agent. 
Renal impairment: 
Sugammadex is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment, including those 
requiring dialysis (see section 5.1). 
Light anaesthesia: 
When neuromuscular blockade was reversed intentionally in the middle of anaesthesia in clinical 
trials, signs of light anaesthesia were noted occasionally (movement, coughing, grimacing and 
suckling of the tracheal tube). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If neuromuscular blockade is reversed, while anaesthesia is continued, additional doses of anaesthetic 
and/or opioid should be given as clinically indicated. 
Marked bradycardia: 
In rare instances, marked bradycardia has been observed within minutes after the administration of 
sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Bradycardia may occasionally lead to cardiac 
arrest. (See section 4.8.) Patients should be closely monitored for haemodynamic changes during and 
after reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Treatment with anti-cholinergic agents such as atropine 
should be administered if clinically significant bradycardia is observed. 
Hepatic impairment: 
Sugammadex is not metabolised nor excreted by the liver; therefore dedicated studies in patients with 
hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be 
treated with great caution. In case hepatic impairment is accompanied by coagulopathy see the 
information on the effect on haemostasis. 
Use in Intensive Care Unit (ICU): 
Sugammadex has not been investigated in patients receiving rocuronium or vecuronium in the ICU 
setting. 
Use for reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents other than rocuronium or vecuronium: 
Sugammadex should not be used to reverse block induced by nonsteroidal neuromuscular blocking 
agents such as succinylcholine or benzylisoquinolinium compounds. 
Sugammadex should not be used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by steroidal 
neuromuscular blocking agents other than rocuronium or vecuronium, since there are no efficacy and 
safety data for these situations. Limited data are available for reversal of pancuronium induced 
blockade, but it is advised not to use sugammadex in this situation. 
Delayed recovery: 
Conditions associated with prolonged circulation time such as cardiovascular disease, old age (see 
section 4.2 for the time to recovery in elderly), or oedematous state (e.g., severe hepatic impairment) 
may be associated with longer recovery times. 
Drug hypersensitivity reactions: 
Clinicians should be prepared for the possibility of drug hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylactic reactions) and take the necessary precautions (see section 4.8). 
Sodium: 
This medicinal product contains up to 9.2 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The information in this section is based on binding affinity between sugammadex and other medicinal 
products, non-clinical experiments, clinical studies and simulations using a model taking into account 
the pharmacodynamic effect of neuromuscular blocking agents and the pharmacokinetic interaction 
between neuromuscular blocking agents and sugammadex. Based on these data, no clinically 
significant pharmacodynamic interaction with other medicinal products is expected, with exception of 
the following: 
For toremifene and fusidic acid displacement interactions could not be excluded (no clinically relevant 
capturing interactions are expected). 
For hormonal contraceptives a clinically relevant capturing interaction could not be excluded (no 
displacement interactions are expected). 
Interactions potentially affecting the efficacy of sugammadex (displacement interactions): 
Due to the administration of certain medicinal products after sugammadex, theoretically rocuronium 
or vecuronium could be displaced from sugammadex. As a result recurrence of neuromuscular 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blockade might be observed. In this situation the patient must be ventilated. Administration of the 
medicinal product which caused displacement should be stopped in case of an infusion. In situations 
when potential displacement interactions can be anticipated, patients should be carefully monitored for 
signs of recurrence of neuromuscular blockade (approximately up to 15 minutes) after parenteral 
administration of another medicinal product occurring within a period of 7.5 hours after sugammadex 
administration. 
Toremifene: 
For toremifene, which has a relatively high binding affinity for sugammadex and for which relatively 
high plasma concentrations might be present, some displacement of vecuronium or rocuronium from 
the complex with sugammadex could occur. Clinicians should be aware that the recovery of the T4/T1 
ratio to 0.9 could therefore be delayed in patients who have received toremifene on the same day of 
the operation. 
Intravenous administration of fusidic acid: 
The use of fusidic acid in the pre-operative phase may give some delay in the recovery of the T4/T1 
ratio to 0.9. No recurrence of neuromuscular blockade is expected in the post-operative phase, since 
the infusion rate of fusidic acid is over a period of several hours and the blood levels are cumulative 
over 2-3 days. For re-administration of sugammadex see section 4.2. 
Interactions potentially affecting the efficacy of other medicinal products (capturing interactions): 
Due to the administration of sugammadex, certain medicinal products could become less effective due 
to a lowering of the (free) plasma concentrations. If such a situation is observed, the clinician is 
advised to consider the re-administration of the medicinal product, the administration of a 
therapeutically equivalent medicinal product (preferably from a different chemical class) and/or 
nonpharmacological interventions as appropriate. 
Hormonal contraceptives: 
The interaction between 4 mg/kg sugammadex and a progestogen was predicted to lead to a decrease 
in progestogen exposure (34% of AUC) similar to the decrease seen when a daily dose of an oral 
contraceptive is taken 12 hours too late, which might lead to a reduction in effectiveness. For 
oestrogens, the effect is expected to be lower. Therefore the administration of a bolus dose of 
sugammadex is considered to be equivalent to one missed daily dose of oral contraceptive steroids 
(either combined or progestogen only). If sugammadex is administered at the same day as an oral 
contraceptive is taken reference is made to missed dose advice in the package leaflet of the oral 
contraceptive. In the case of non-oral hormonal contraceptives, the patient must use an additional non 
hormonal contraceptive method for the next 7 days and refer to the advice in the package leaflet of the 
product. 
Interactions due to the lasting effect of rocuronium or vecuronium: 
When medicinal products which potentiate neuromuscular blockade are used in the post-operative 
period special attention should be paid to the possibility of recurrence of neuromuscular blockade. 
Please refer to the package leaflet of rocuronium or vecuronium for a list of the specific medicinal 
products which potentiate neuromuscular blockade. In case recurrence of neuromuscular blockade is 
observed, the patient may require mechanical ventilation and re-administration of sugammadex (see 
section 4.2). 
Interference with laboratory tests: 
In general sugammadex does not interfere with laboratory tests, with the possible exception of the 
serum progesterone assay. Interference with this test is observed at sugammadex plasma 
concentrations of 100 microgram/mL (peak plasma level following 8 mg/kg bolus injection). 
In a study in volunteers doses of 4 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of sugammadex resulted in maximum mean 
prolongations of aPTT by 17 and 22% respectively and of PT(INR) by 11 and 22% respectively. 
These limited mean aPTT and PT(INR) prolongations were of short duration (≤ 30 minutes). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In in vitro experiments a pharmacodynamic interaction (aPTT and PT prolongation) was noted with 
vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparinoids, rivaroxaban and 
dabigatran (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
No formal interaction studies have been performed. The above-mentioned interactions for adults and 
the warnings in section 4.4 should also be taken into account for the paediatric population. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For sugammadex no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonic/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. 
Caution should be exercised when administering sugammadex to pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sugammadex is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of sugammadex in breast milk. Oral absorption of cyclodextrins in general is low and no 
effect on the suckling child is anticipated following a single dose to the breast-feeding woman. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
sugammadex therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effects with sugammadex on human fertility have not been investigated. Animal studies to 
evaluate fertility do not reveal harmful effects. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sugammadex Mylan has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Sugammadex Mylan is administered concomitantly with neuromuscular blocking agents and 
anaesthetics in surgical patients. The causality of adverse events is therefore difficult to assess. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in surgical patients were cough, airway complication 
of anaesthesia, anaesthetic complications, procedural hypotension and procedural complication 
(Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)). 
Table 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of sugammadex has been evaluated in 3,519 unique subjects across a pooled phase I-III 
safety database. The following adverse reactions were reported in placebo-controlled trials where 
subjects received anaesthesia and/or neuromuscular blocking agents (1,078 subject exposures to 
sugammadex versus 544 to placebo): 
[Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000)]

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Drug hypersensitivity reactions: 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in some patients and volunteers (for 
information on volunteers, see Information on healthy volunteers below). In clinical trials of surgical 
patients these reactions were reported uncommonly and for post-marketing reports the frequency is 
unknown. 
These reactions varied from isolated skin reactions to serious systemic reactions (i.e. anaphylaxis, 
anaphylactic shock) and have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to sugammadex. 
Symptoms associated with these reactions can include: flushing, urticaria, erythematous rash, (severe) 
hypotension, tachycardia, swelling of tongue, swelling of pharynx, bronchospasm and pulmonary 
obstructive events. Severe hypersensitivity reactions can be fatal. 
Airway complication of anaesthesia: 
Airway complications of anaesthesia included bucking against the endotracheal tube, coughing, mild 
bucking, arousal reaction during surgery, coughing during the anaesthetic procedure or during surgery, 
or anaesthetic procedure-related spontaneous breath of patient. 
Anaesthetic complication: 
Anaesthetic complications, indicative of the restoration of neuromuscular function, include movement 
of a limb or the body or coughing during the anaesthetic procedure or during surgery, grimacing, or 
suckling on the endotracheal tube. See section 4.4 light anaesthesia. 
Procedural complication: 
Procedural complications included coughing, tachycardia, bradycardia, movement, and increase in 
heart rate. 
Marked bradycardia: 
In post-marketing, isolated cases of marked bradycardia and bradycardia with cardiac arrest have been 
observed within minutes after administration of sugammadex (see section 4.4). 
Recurrence of neuromuscular blockade: 
In clinical studies with subjects treated with rocuronium or vecuronium, where sugammadex was 
administered using a dose labelled for the depth of neuromuscular blockade (N=2,022), an incidence 
of 0.20% was observed for recurrence of neuromuscular blockade as based on neuromuscular 
monitoring or clinical evidence (see section 4.4). 
Information on healthy volunteers: 
A randomised, double-blind study examined the incidence of drug hypersensitivity reactions in 
healthy volunteers given up to 3 doses of placebo (N=76), sugammadex 4 mg/kg (N=151) or 
sugammadex 16 mg/kg (N=148). Reports of suspected hypersensitivity were adjudicated by a blinded 
committee. The incidence of adjudicated hypersensitivity was 1.3%, 6.6% and 9.5% in the placebo, 
sugammadex 4 mg/kg and sugammadex 16 mg/kg groups, respectively. There were no reports of 
anaphylaxis after placebo or sugammadex 4 mg/kg. There was a single case of adjudicated 
anaphylaxis after the first dose of sugammadex 16 mg/kg (incidence 0.7%). There was no evidence of 
increased frequency or severity of hypersensitivity with repeat dosing of sugammadex. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a previous study of similar design, there were three adjudicated cases of anaphylaxis, all after 
sugammadex 16 mg/kg (incidence 2.0%). 
In the Pooled Phase 1 database, AEs considered common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) or very common (≥ 1/10) 
and more frequent among subjects treated with sugammadex than in the placebo group, include 
dysgeusia (10.1%), headache (6.7%), nausea (5.6%), urticaria (1.7%), pruritus (1.7%), dizziness 
(1.6%), vomiting (1.2%) and abdominal pain (1.0%). 
Additional information on special populations 
Pulmonary patients: 
In post-marketing data and in one dedicated clinical trial in patients with a history of pulmonary 
complications, bronchospasm was reported as a possibly related adverse event. As with all patients 
with a history of pulmonary complications the physician should be aware of the possible occurrence of 
bronchospasm. 
Paediatric population 
In studies of paediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age, the safety profile of sugammadex (up to 4 mg/kg) 
was generally similar to the profile observed in adults. 
Morbidly obese patients 
In one dedicated clinical trial in morbidly obese patients, the safety profile was generally similar to the 
profile in adult patients in pooled Phase 1 to 3 studies (see Table 2). 
Patients with severe systemic disease 
In a trial in patients who were assessed as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 3 or 4 
(patients with severe systemic disease or patients with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat 
to life), the adverse reaction profile in these ASA Class 3 and 4 patients was generally similar to that 
of adult patients in pooled Phase 1 to 3 studies (see Table 2). See section 5.1. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies, 1 case of an accidental overdose with 40 mg/kg was reported without any 
significant adverse reactions. In a human tolerance study sugammadex was administered in doses up 
to 96 mg/kg. No dose related adverse events nor serious adverse events were reported. Sugammadex 
can be removed using haemodialysis with a high flux filter, but not with a low flux filter. Based upon 
clinical studies, sugammadex concentrations in plasma are reduced by up to 70% after a 3 to 6-hour 
dialysis session.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: all other therapeutic products, antidotes, ATC code: V03AB35 
Mechanism of action: 
Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin which is a Selective Relaxant Binding Agent. It 
forms a complex with the neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium or vecuronium in plasma and 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thereby reduces the amount of neuromuscular blocking agent available to bind to nicotinic receptors in 
the neuromuscular junction. This results in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by 
rocuronium or vecuronium. 
Pharmacodynamic effects: 
Sugammadex has been administered in doses ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg in dose response 
studies of rocuronium induced blockade (0.6, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium bromide with and 
without maintenance doses) and vecuronium induced blockade (0.1 mg/kg vecuronium bromide with 
or without maintenance doses) at different time points/depths of blockade. In these studies a clear 
dose-response relationship was observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety: 
Sugammadex can be administered at several time points after administration of rocuronium or 
vecuronium bromide: 
Routine reversal – deep neuromuscular blockade: 
In a pivotal study patients were randomly assigned to the rocuronium or vecuronium group. After the 
last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, at 1-2 PTCs, 4 mg/kg sugammadex or 70 mcg/kg neostigmine 
was administered in a randomised order. The time from start of administration of sugammadex or 
neostigmine to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was:

After the last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, at the reappearance of T2, 2 mg/kg sugammadex or

Renal impairment: 
Two open label studies compared the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in surgical patients with and 
without severe renal impairment. In one study, sugammadex was administered following rocuronium 
induced blockade at 1-2 PTCs (4 mg/kg; N=68); in the other study, sugammadex was administered at 
reappearance of T2 (2 mg/kg; N=30). Recovery from blockade was modestly longer for patients with 
severe renal impairment relative to patients without renal impairment. No residual neuromuscular 
blockade or recurrence of neuromuscular blockade was reported for patients with severe renal 
impairment in these studies. 
Morbidly obese patients: 
A trial of 188 patients who were diagnosed as morbidly obese investigated the time to recovery from 
moderate or deep neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. Patients received 
2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex, as appropriate for level of block, dosed according to either actual 
body weight or ideal body weight in random, double-blinded fashion. Pooled across depth of block 
and neuromuscular blocking agent, the median time to recover to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio ≥ 0.9 in 
patients dosed by actual body weight (1.8 minutes) was statistically significantly faster (p < 0.0001) 
compared to patients dosed by ideal body weight (3.3 minutes). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric Population: 
A trial of 288 patients aged 2 to < 17 years investigated the safety and efficacy of sugammadex versus 
neostigmine as a reversal agent for neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. 
Recovery from moderate block to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 was significantly faster in the sugammadex 
2 mg/kg group compared with the neostigmine group (geometric mean of 1.6 minutes for 
sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 7.5 minutes for neostigmine, ratio of geometric means 0.22, 95 % CI (0.16, 
0.32), (p<0.0001)). Sugammadex 4 mg/kg achieved reversal from deep block with a geometric mean 
of 2.0 minutes, similar to results observed in adults. These effects were consistent for all age cohorts 
studied (2 to < 6; 6 to < 12; 12 to < 17 years of age) and for both rocuronium and vecuronium. See 
section 4.2. 
Patients with severe systemic disease: 
A trial of 331 patients who were assessed as ASA Class 3 or 4 investigated the incidence of treatment 
emergent arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, or other cardiac arrhythmias) after 
administration of sugammadex. 
In patients receiving sugammadex (2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, or 16 mg/kg), the incidence of treatment 
emergent arrhythmias was generally similar to neostigmine (50 µg/kg up to 5 mg maximum 
dose) + glycopyrrolate (10 µg/kg up to 1 mg maximum dose). The adverse reaction profile in ASA 
Class 3 and 4 patients was generally similar to that of adult patients in pooled Phase 1 to 3 studies; 
therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary. See section 4.8. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the total sum of non-complex-
bound and complex-bound concentrations of sugammadex. Pharmacokinetic parameters as clearance 
and volume of distribution are assumed to be the same for non-complex-bound and complex-bound 
sugammadex in anaesthetised subjects. 
Distribution: 
The observed steady-state volume of distribution of sugammadex is approximately 11 to 14 litres in 
adult patients with normal renal function (based on conventional, non-compartmental pharmacokinetic 
analysis). Neither sugammadex nor the complex of sugammadex and rocuronium binds to plasma 
proteins or erythrocytes, as was shown in vitro using male human plasma and whole blood. 
Sugammadex exhibits linear kinetics in the dosage range of 1 to 16 mg/kg when administered as an IV 
bolus dose. 
Metabolism: 
In preclinical and clinical studies no metabolites of sugammadex have been observed and only renal 
excretion of the unchanged product was observed as the route of elimination. 
Elimination: 
In adult anaesthetised patients with normal renal function the elimination half-life (t1/2) of 
sugammadex is about 2 hours and the estimated plasma clearance is about 88 mL/min. A mass balance 
study demonstrated that > 90% of the dose was excreted within 24 hours. 96% of the dose was 
excreted in urine, of which at least 95% could be attributed to unchanged sugammadex. Excretion via 
faeces or expired air was less than 0.02% of the dose. Administration of sugammadex to healthy 
volunteers resulted in increased renal elimination of rocuronium in complex. 
Special populations: 
Renal impairment and age: 
In a pharmacokinetic study comparing patients with severe renal impairment to patients with normal 
renal function, sugammadex levels in plasma were similar during the first hour after dosing, and 
thereafter the levels decreased faster in the control group. Total exposure to sugammadex was 
prolonged, leading to 17-fold higher exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. Low 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations of sugammadex are detectable for at least 48 hours post-dose in patients with severe 
renal insufficiency. 
In a second study comparing subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment to subjects with 
normal renal function, sugammadex clearance progressively decreased and t1/2 was progressively 
prolonged with declining renal function. Exposure was 2-fold and 5-fold higher in subjects with 
moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. Sugammadex concentrations were no longer 
detectable beyond 7 days post-dose in subjects with severe renal insufficiency

function is presented below:

Race: 
In a study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects no clinically relevant differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters were observed. Limited data does not indicate differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters in Black or African Americans. 
Body weight: 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of adult and elderly patients showed no clinically relevant 
relationship of clearance and volume of distribution with body weight. 
Obesity: 
In one clinical study in morbidly obese patients, sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg was dosed 
according to actual body weight (n=76) or ideal body weight (n=74). Sugammadex exposure increased 
in a dose-dependent, linear manner following administration according to actual body weight or ideal 
body weight. No clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between 
morbidly obese patients and the general population.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity potential, and toxicity to reproduction, local 
tolerance or compatibility with blood. 
Sugammadex is rapidly cleared in preclinical species, although residual sugammadex was observed in 
bone and teeth of juvenile rats. Preclinical studies in young adult and mature rats demonstrate that 
sugammadex does not adversely affect tooth colour or bone quality, bone structure, or bone 
metabolism. Sugammadex has no effects on fracture repair and remodelling of bone.

be a selective relaxant binding agent since it only works with specific muscle relaxants, rocuronium 
bromide or vecuronium bromide. 
What Sugammadex Mylan is used for 
When you have some types of operations, your muscles must be completely relaxed. This makes it 
easier for the surgeon to do the operation. For this, the general anaesthetic you are given includes 
medicines to make your muscles relax. These are called muscle relaxants, and examples include 
rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide. Because these medicines also make your breathing 
muscles relax, you need help to breathe (artificial ventilation) during and after your operation until you 
can breathe on your own again. 
Sugammadex Mylan is used to speed up the recovery of your muscles after an operation to allow you 
to breathe on your own again earlier. It does this by combining with the rocuronium bromide or 
vecuronium bromide in your body. It can be used in adults whenever rocuronium bromide or 
vecuronium bromide is used and in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 years) when rocuronium 
bromide is used for a moderate level of relaxation.

Other medicines and Sugammadex Mylan 
Tell your anaesthetist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Sugammadex Mylan may affect other medicines or be affected by them. 
Some medicines reduce the effect of Sugammadex Mylan 
It is especially important that you tell your anaesthetist if you have recently taken: 
• 
• 
toremifene (used to treat breast cancer). 
fusidic acid (an antibiotic). 
Sugammadex Mylan can affect hormonal contraceptives 
Sugammadex Mylan can make hormonal contraceptives - including the ‘Pill’, vaginal ring, implants or 
a hormonal IntraUterine System (IUS) - less effective because it reduces how much you get of the 
progestogen hormone. The amount of progestogen lost by using Sugammadex Mylan is about the 
same as missing one oral contraceptive Pill. 
• 
instructions for a missed dose in the Pill’s package leaflet. 
• 
If you are taking the Pill on the same day as Sugammadex Mylan is given to you, follow the 
If you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant or IUS) 
you should use an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method (such as a condom) for the 
next 7 days and follow the advice in the package leaflet. 
Effects on blood tests 
In general, Sugammadex Mylan does not have an effect on laboratory tests. However, it may affect the 
results of a blood test for a hormone called progesterone. Talk to your doctor if your progesterone 
levels need to be tested on the same day you receive Sugammadex Mylan 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Tell your anaesthetist if you are pregnant or might be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding. 
You may still be given Sugammadex Mylan, but you need to discuss it first. 
It is not known whether sugammadex can pass into breast milk. Your anaesthetist will help you decide 
whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to abstain from sugammadex therapy, considering the 
benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Sugamadex Mylan to the mother.

Sugammadex Mylan has no known influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
Sugammadex Mylan contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 9.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each mL. 
This is equivalent to 0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

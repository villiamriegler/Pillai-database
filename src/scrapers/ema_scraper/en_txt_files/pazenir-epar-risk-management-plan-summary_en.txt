Brief description of the 
product 
[Paclitaxel, albumin bound] 5 mg/ml powder for dispersion for infusion 
Centralised 
Chemical class: 
Taxane 
Summary of mode of action: 
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules 
from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. 
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the 
microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular 
functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of 
microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during 
mitosis. 
[Paclitaxel, albumin bound] 5 mg/ml powder for dispersion for infusion contains 
human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles of approximately 130 nm in size, 
where the paclitaxel is present in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. Upon 
intravenous administration, the nanoparticles dissociate rapidly into soluble, 
albumin bound paclitaxel complexes of approximately 10 nm in size. Albumin is 
known to mediate endothelial caveolar transcytosis of plasma constituents, and in 
vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin in paclitaxel enhances 
transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells. It is hypothesised that this enhanced 
transendothelial caveolar transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor, and 
that there is enhanced accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the 
albumin-binding protein Secreted Protein Acidic Rich in Cysteine (SPARC). 
Important information about its composition: 
Paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles contains human serum 
albumin. The human serum albumin that is used by the drug product manufacturer 
has a marketing authorization in the EU and is linked to a certified plasma master

Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for [Paclitaxel, albumin bound] 5 mg/ml 
powder for dispersion for infusion  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for [Paclitaxel, albumin bound] 5 mg/ml 
powder for dispersion for infusion (herein after referred to as Paclitaxel (albumin bound)). The 
RMP details important risks of Paclitaxel (albumin bound), how these risks can be minimised, 
and how more information will be obtained about Paclitaxel (albumin bound)'s risks and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
Paclitaxel (albumin bound)'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet 
give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Paclitaxel (albumin 
bound) should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Paclitaxel (albumin bound) should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Paclitaxel 
(albumin bound)'s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for
Paclitaxel (albumin bound) is authorised for: 
•
•
•
the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in adult patients who have failed first-line
treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline containing
therapy is not indicated;
in combination with gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of adult patients with
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
and in combination with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or
radiation therapy (see SmPC for the full indication).
It contains paclitaxel (albumin bound) as the active substance and it is given by intravenous route 
of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Paclitaxel (albumin bound)’s benefits can be found 
in Paclitaxel (albumin bound)’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the 
EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Paclitaxel (albumin bound), together with measures to minimise such risks 
and the proposed studies for learning more about Paclitaxel (albumin bound)'s risks, are outlined 
below. 
TEVA 
Page 13 of 23 
Paclitaxel (albumin bound) 
RMP v2.0 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Paclitaxel (albumin bound) are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered/taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Paclitaxel (albumin bound). 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine). There 
were no safety concerns applicable for this EU RMP based on the requirement to present only 
the important identified or potential risks and missing information linked to further 
pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimization measures in the EU. 
II.B Summary of Important Risks
The safety information in the proposed Product Information is aligned to the reference medicinal 
product. 
II.C Post-Authorisation Development Plan
II.C.1 Studies Which Are Conditions of the Marketing Authorisation
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of 
Paclitaxel (albumin bound). 
II.C.2 Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan
There are no studies required for Paclitaxel (albumin bound).

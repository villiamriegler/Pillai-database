CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ZOSTAVAX is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (“zoster” or shingles) and herpes
zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).
ZOSTAVAX is indicated for immunization of individuals 50 years of age or older.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Individuals should receive a single dose (0.65 mL).
The need for a booster dose is not known. See sections 4.8 and 5.1.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of ZOSTAVAX in children and adolescents have not been established. No
data are available.
There is no relevant use of ZOSTAVAX in children and adolescents for prevention of primary
varicella infection (chickenpox).
 2
Method of administration
The vaccine can be injected subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM), preferably in the deltoid
region (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or any
coagulation disorder (see section 4.4).
The vaccine should under no circumstances be injected intravascularly.
For precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product, see section 6.6.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or
neomycin (which may be present as trace residues, see sections 2 and 4.4).
Primary and acquired immunodeficiency states due to conditions such as: acute and chronic
leukaemias; lymphoma; other conditions affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system;
immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1); cellular immune
deficiencies.
Immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose corticosteroids) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8);
however, ZOSTAVAX is not contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving
topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose systemic corticosteroids or in patients who are
receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for adrenal insufficiency (see sections 4.8
and 5.1).
Active untreated tuberculosis.
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see
section 4.6).
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction following the administration of the vaccine, as there is a
possibility of hypersensitivity reactions, not only to the active substances, but also to the excipients
and trace residuals (e.g. neomycin) present in the vaccine (see sections 4.3, 4.8 and 6.1).
Neomycin allergy generally manifests as a contact dermatitis. However, a history of contact dermatitis
due to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving live virus vaccines.
ZOSTAVAX is a live, attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine and administration to individuals who are
immunosuppressed or immunodeficient may result in disseminated varicella-zoster virus disease,
including fatal outcomes. Patients who previously received immune suppressive therapy should be
carefully evaluated for the reconstitution of the immune system prior to receiving Zostavax (see
section 4.3). 
The safety and efficacy of ZOSTAVAX have not been established in adults who are known to be
infected with HIV with or without evidence of immunosuppression (see section 4.3) however, a phase
II safety and immunogenicity study in HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function (CD 4+T
cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL) has been completed (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with severe thrombocytopenia or any
coagulation disorder, because these individuals may bleed following intramuscular injections.
ZOSTAVAX is not indicated for treatment of zoster or PHN.
Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe acute febrile
illness or infection.
As for any vaccine, vaccination with ZOSTAVAX may not result in protection in all vaccine
recipients. See section 5.1.
Transmission
In clinical trials with ZOSTAVAX, transmission of the vaccine virus has not been reported. However,
post-marketing experience with varicella vaccines suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may
occur rarely between vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and susceptible contacts [for
example, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) susceptible infant grandchildren]. Transmission of vaccine virus
from varicella vaccine recipients who do not develop a varicella-like rash has also been reported. This
is a theoretical risk for vaccination with ZOSTAVAX. The risk of transmitting the attenuated vaccine
virus from a vaccinee to a susceptible contact should be weighed against the risk of developing natural
zoster and potentially transmitting wild-type VZV to a susceptible contact.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say
essentially ‘sodium-free’.
Potassium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say
essentially ‘potassium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
ZOSTAVAX can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine as separate
injections and at different body sites (see section 5.1).
The concomitant use of ZOSTAVAX and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine resulted
in reduced immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX in a small clinical trial. However, data collected in a large
observational study did not indicate increased risk for developing herpes zoster after concomitant
administration of the two vaccines.
No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines.
Concurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and anti-viral medications known to be effective against
VZV has not been evaluated.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of ZOSTAVAX in pregnant women. Traditional non-clinical studies are
insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). However naturally-occurring
varicella-zoster virus infection is known to sometimes cause foetal harm. ZOSTAVAX is not
recommended to be administered to pregnant women. In any case, pregnancy should be avoided for
one month following vaccination (see section 4.3).
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether VZV is secreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be
excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to not administer
 4
ZOSTAVAX taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of
vaccination for the woman.
Fertility
ZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated in fertility studies.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. However,
ZOSTAVAX is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
a. Summary of the safety profile
The most common adverse reactions reported in pivotal clinical trials were injection-site reactions.
Headache and pain in the extremity were the most common systemic adverse reactions. Most of these
local and systemic adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. Vaccine-related serious
adverse reactions were reported for 0.01 % subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and subjects who
received placebo.
Data from a clinical trial (n=368) demonstrated that the current refrigerated formulation has a safety
profile comparable to that of the frozen formulation.
b. Tabulated summary of adverse events
In clinical trials, general safety has been evaluated in more than 57,000 adults vaccinated with
ZOSTAVAX.
Table 1 presents vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a
significantly greater incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group within 42 days post-
vaccination in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety trial (ZEST) study and in the Adverse Event
Monitoring Substudy of Shingles Prevention Study (SPS).
Additional adverse reactions, spontaneously reported through post-marketing surveillance, are also
included in Table 1. As these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is
not possible to reliably calculate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.
Consequently, the frequencies of these adverse reactions have been estimated based on the adverse
events reported in SPS and ZEST (regardless of vaccine relationship assigned by the investigator).
The adverse reactions are assigned frequency categories using the following convention:
Very Common (≥ 1/10); 
Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
Rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); 
Very rare (< 1/10,000)

Common
Rare
Injection site reactions
Vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions were significantly greater for subjects vaccinated with
ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo. In SPS, the overall incidence of vaccine-related
injection-site adverse reactions were 48 % for ZOSTAVAX and 17 % for placebo in subjects 60 years
of age and older.
In ZEST, the overall incidence of vaccine-related injection site adverse reactions were 63.9 % for
ZOSTAVAX and 14.4 % for placebo in subjects 50 to 59 years of age. Most of these adverse reactions
were reported as mild in intensity.
In other clinical trials evaluating ZOSTAVAX in subjects 50 years of age or older, including a study
of concomitantly administered inactivated influenza vaccine, a higher rate of injection-site adverse
experiences of mild-to-moderate intensity was reported among subjects 50-59 years of age compared
with subjects ≥ 60 years of age (see section 5.1).
ZOSTAVAX was administered either subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM) in subjects
50 years of age or older (see section 5.1). The general safety profiles of the SC and IM routes were
otherwise comparable, but injection-site adverse reactions were significantly less frequent in the IM
group (34 %) compared with the SC group (64 %).
Herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes and Varicella/varicella-like rashes in clinical trials
In clinical trials the number of herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes within the 42-day post-
vaccination was low in both ZOSTAVAX and placebo groups. The majority of rashes have been rated
as mild to moderate; no complications from rash have been observed in the clinical setting. Most of
the reporting rashes that were VZV positive by PCR analysis were associated with wild-type VZV.
 6
In SPS and ZEST, the number of subjects who reported herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes was
less than 0.2 % for ZOSTAVAX and placebo groups, with no significant difference observed between
the two groups. The number of subjects who reported varicella/varicella-like rashes was less than
0.7 % for ZOSTAVAX and placebo.
The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any specimens in SPS or ZEST. VZV was
detected in one (0.01 %) specimen from a ZOSTAVAX recipient reporting a varicella/varicella-like
rash; however, the virus strain (wild type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be determined. Across all
other clinical trials, the Oka/Merck strain was identified by PCR analysis from the lesion specimens of
only two subjects who reported varicella-like rashes (onset on Day 8 and 17).
d. Special populations
Adults with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination
ZOSTAVAX was administered to subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster
(HZ) prior to vaccination (see section 5.1). The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in the
Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. 
Adults on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids
In subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid
therapy at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment,
and 6 weeks or more following vaccination, the safety profile was generally comparable to that seen in
the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS (see sections 4.3 and 5.1).
HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function
In a clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to HIV-infected adults (18 years of age or older,
CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL) (see section 5.1). The safety profile was generally similar to the
Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. Adverse events were followed up to Day 42 post
vaccination and serious adverse events throughout the entire study period (i.e. through Day 180). Of
the 295 ZOSTAVAX recipients, one case of serious vaccine related maculo-papular rash was reported
on Day 4 following Dose 1 of ZOSTAVAX (see section 4.3). 
VZV-seronegative adults
Based on limited data from 2 clinical trials that enrolled VZV-seronegative or low seropositive
subjects (30 years of age or older) receiving live attenuated zoster vaccine, injection site and systemic
adverse experiences were generally similar to those reported by other subjects who received
ZOSTAVAX in clinical trials, with 2 of the 27 subjects reporting fever. No subjects reported
varicella-like or herpes zoster-like rashes. No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were
reported.
e. Other studies
Adults receiving additional doses/revaccination 
In a clinical study, adults 60 years of age or older received a second dose of ZOSTAVAX 42 days
following the initial dose (see section 5.1). The frequency of vaccine-related adverse experiences after
the second dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that seen with the first dose.
In another study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as a booster dose to HZ history-negative subjects
70 years of age or older who had received a first dose approximately 10 years previously, and as a first
dose to HZ history-negative subjects 70 years of age or older (see section 5.1). The frequency of
vaccine-related adverse experiences after the booster dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to
that seen with the first dose.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
 7
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Administration of a higher than recommended dose of ZOSTAVAX was reported rarely and the
adverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of
ZOSTAVAX.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BK02
Mechanism of action
Anyone who has been infected with VZV, including those without a clinical history of varicella, is at
risk for developing zoster. This risk appears to be causally related to a decline in VZV-specific
immunity. ZOSTAVAX was shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the
mechanism by which it protects against zoster and its complications (see Immunogenicity).
Clinical Efficacy
The protective clinical efficacy of ZOSTAVAX was demonstrated in two large, randomised, placebo
controlled clinical trials where subjects received ZOSTAVAX subcutaneously (see Tables 2 and 3).
ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in subjects 50 to 59 years of age:
The ZEST study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in which 22,439 subjects were
randomised to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX or placebo and were followed for the
development of zoster for a median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). Final determination of zoster
cases was made by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [86 %], or in the absence of virus detection, as
determined by a clinical evaluation committee [14 %]. ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the
incidence of zoster compared to placebo (see Table 2).

development of zoster for a median of 3.1 years (range 31 days to 4.9 years).
ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (see Table 3).

the study who were followed for at least 30 days post-vaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of zoster within the
first 30 days post vaccination
† Age strata at randomisation were 60-69 and ≥ 70 years of age
In the SPS, the reduction in zoster was seen in almost all dermatomes. Ophthalmic zoster occurred in
35 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 69 subjects who received placebo. Impaired vision
occurred in 2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 9 who received placebo.
ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) compared with
placebo (see Table 4). In subjects who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX decreased the risk of
subsequently developing PHN. In the vaccine group, the risk of developing PHN after zoster was 9 %
(27/315), while in the placebo group it was 13 % (80/642). This effect was more prominent in the
group of older subjects (≥ 70 years of age), where the risk of developing PHN after zoster was reduced
to 10 % in the vaccine group vs. 19 % for the placebo group.

† The zoster pain BOI score is a composite score that incorporates the incidence, severity, and duration of acute and chronic
zoster-associated pain over a 6 month follow-up period.
‡ Age strata at randomisation were 60-69 and ≥ 70 years of age.
Prevention of HZ cases with severe pain in the entire SPS study population
ZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of zoster with severe and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration
score > 600) by 73 % (95 % CI: [46 to 87 %]) compared with placebo (11 vs. 40 cases, respectively). 
Reduction of zoster pain severity-by-duration in vaccinated individuals who developed zoster
With regard to the acute pain (pain between 0-30 days) there was no statistically significant difference
between the vaccine group and the placebo group. 
 10 
However, among vaccinated individuals who developed PHN, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced
PHN-associated (chronic) pain compared with placebo. In the period from 90 days after rash onset to
the end of follow-up, there was a 57 % reduction in the severity-by-duration score (average scores of
347 for ZOSTAVAX and 805 for placebo; p=0.016).
Overall, among vaccinated individuals who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced
overall acute and chronic zoster-associated pain compared with placebo. Over the 6-month (acute and
chronic) follow-up period, there was a 22 % reduction (p=0.008) in the severity-by-duration score and
a 52 % (95 % CI: [7 to 74 %]) reduction (from 6.2 % to 3.5 %) in the risk of having zoster with severe
and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration score of > 600).
Zostavax persistence of protection
The persistence of protection following vaccination has been evaluated through longer-term follow-up
in Short-term Persistence Substudy (STPS) and Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS) and supports
the continued benefit of ZOSTAVAX throughout the follow-up periods studied. The STPS was
initiated to accrue additional information on the persistence of vaccine efficacy for subjects who
received ZOSTAVAX in SPS.
Persistence of ZOSTAVAX efficacy was studied 4 to 7 years post-vaccination in the STPS, which
included 7,320 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and 6,950 subjects previously
vaccinated with placebo in the SPS (mean age at enrollment was 73.3 years); and 7 to 10 years post-
vaccination in the Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS), which included 6,867 subjects previously
vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (mean age at enrollment into the LTPS was 74.5 years). The median
follow-up was ~1.2 years (range is one day to 2.2 years) and ~3.9 years (range is one week to
4.75 years) in STPS and LTPS, respectively. During the course of the STPS, placebo recipients were
offered ZOSTAVAX, at which time they were considered to have completed the STPS. A concurrent
placebo control was not available in the LTPS; data from prior placebo recipients were used to
estimate vaccine efficacy.
In the STPS, there were 84 evaluable zoster cases [8.4/1,000 person-years] in the ZOSTAVAX group
and 95 evaluable cases [14.0/1,000 person-years] in the placebo group. The estimated vaccine efficacy
during the STPS follow-up period was 40 % (95 % CI: [18 to 56 %]) for zoster incidence, 60 % (95 %
CI: [-10 to 87 %]) for PHN incidence and 50 % (95 % CI: [14 to 71 %]) for zoster BOI.
In the LTPS, there were 263 evaluable zoster cases reported among 261 patients
[10.3/1000 person-years]. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the LTPS follow-up period was 21 %
(95 % CI: [11 to 30 %]) for zoster incidence, 35 % (95 % CI: [9 to 56 %]) for PHN incidence and
37 % (95 % CI: [27 to 46 %]) for zoster BOI. 
Long-term effectiveness study in individuals 50 years of age or older
In a large-scale US prospective observational cohort study of the long-term effectiveness of
ZOSTAVAX, individuals 50 years of age or older at the time of vaccination were followed for the
occurrence of HZ and PHN using validated endpoints.
Out of 1,505,647 study individuals, 507,444 received ZOSTAVAX between 2007 and 2018. A total of
75,135 confirmed HZ cases and 4,954 confirmed PHN cases (> 90 days of zoster-associated pain)
were observed. The results showed that ZOSTAVAX is effective in reducing HZ and PHN incidence
for over 8-10 years in vaccinated individuals as compared to an unvaccinated reference group. 
Estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against HZ by age at vaccination and average VE estimates
over the first 3, 5, 8 and 10 years postvaccination are shown below (see Table 6).

Immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX
Shingles Prevention Study (SPS)
Within SPS, immune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a subset of the enrolled subjects
(N=1395). ZOSTAVAX elicited significantly higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks post-
vaccination compared with placebo. 
ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST)
Within ZEST, immune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a random 10 % subcohort (n=1,136
for ZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects enrolled in the ZEST. ZOSTAVAX elicited
significantly higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks post-vaccination compared with
placebo.
When evaluated at 4 weeks post-vaccination, the immunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable
formulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenicity of the earlier frozen formulation of
ZOSTAVAX.
Subjects who received ZOSTAVAX by SC (subcutaneous) or IM (intramuscular) route
In an open-label, randomised, controlled clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered either by SC
route or by IM route to 353 subjects 50 years of age or older. Subjects with severe thrombocytopenia
or any other coagulation disorder were excluded. The VZV specific immune responses to
ZOSTAVAX at Week 4 post-vaccination were comparable whether administered by SC or IM route.
Concomitant administration
In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 762 adults 50 years of age and older were randomised to
receive a single dose of ZOSTAVAX administered either concomitantly (N=382) or nonconcomitantly
(N=380) with inactivated split influenza vaccine. The VZV-specific immune responses to both
 13 
 
 
 
vaccines at 4 weeks post-vaccination were similar, whether administered concomitantly or
nonconcomitantly.
In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomised to
receive a single dose of ZOSTAVAX either concomitantly (N=237), or nonconcomitantly (N=236)
with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. At four weeks post-vaccination, the
VZV-specific immune responses following concomitant use were not similar to the VZV-specific
immune responses following nonconcomitant administration. However in a US effectiveness cohort
study of 35,025 adults ≥ 60 years old, no increased risk of herpes zoster was observed in individuals
who received ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine concomitantly
(n=16,532) as compared to individuals receiving ZOSTAVAX one month to one year after 23-valent
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (n=18,493) in routine practice. The adjusted hazard ratio
comparing the incidence rate of HZ in the two groups was 1.04 (95 % CI, 0.92, 1.16) over a median
follow-up of 4.7 years. The data do not indicate that concomitant administration alters the
effectiveness of ZOSTAVAX.
Subjects with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to
100 subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster prior to vaccination to assess
immunogenicity and safety (see section 4.8) of ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX induced a significantly
higher VZV-specific immune response at 4 weeks post-vaccination, compared with placebo.
VZV-specific immune responses were generally similar in subjects 50 to 59 compared to subjects
≥ 60 years of age.
Adults receiving additional doses/revaccination
The need for, or timing of, a booster dose with ZOSTAVAX has not yet been determined. In an
open-label study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as: (1) a booster dose to 201 zoster history-negative
subjects 70 years of age or older who had received a first dose approximately 10 years previously as
participants in the SPS, and (2) a first dose to 199 zoster history-negative subjects 70 years of age or
older. The VZV-specific immune responses to vaccine 6 weeks post-vaccination was comparable in
the booster dose and first dose group.
Subjects on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to
206 subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid
therapy at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment,
and 6 weeks or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of
ZOSTAVAX. Compared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX induced a higher VZV-specific immune
response at 6 weeks post-vaccination. 
HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to
HIV-infected adults (18 years of age or older; median age 49 years) on appropriate antiretroviral
therapy with conserved immune function (CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL). Although, ZOSTAVAX
is indicated as a single dose regimen (see section 4.2), a two-dose regimen was used. 286 subjects
received two doses and 9 subjects received only one dose. The VZV-specific immune responses
following Doses 1 and 2 were similar (see section 4.3).
Immunocompromised subjects
The vaccine has not been studied in subjects with impaired immunity.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with
ZOSTAVAX in all the subsets of paediatric population (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric
use).

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for
ZOSTAVAX is a vaccine used to prevent shingles (zoster) and zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia
(PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles.
ZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older.
ZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles.
Disease information on shingles:
What is shingles? 
Shingles is a painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several
weeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin
infections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the
same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in
your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes
shingles. 
What is PHN? 
After the shingles blisters heal, pain can last for months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting
nerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX 
Do not receive ZOSTAVAX
if you are allergic to any of the components of this vaccine (including neomycin (which may be
present as trace residue) or any of the other ingredients listed in section 6)
if you have a blood disorder or any type of cancer that weakens your immune system
if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result of a
disease, medicines, or other treatment

before you receive this vaccine.
As with many vaccines, ZOSTAVAX may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.
If you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine should be given under the
skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.
Other medicines and ZOSTAVAX
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines
or vaccines.
ZOSTAVAX can be administered at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccine. The two vaccines
should be given as separate injections at different body sites.
For information about the administration of ZOSTAVAX and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
at the same time, talk to your doctor or health care provider.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
ZOSTAVAX should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing potential should take
the necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination. 
Inform your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intending to breast-feed. Your doctor will decide if
ZOSTAVAX should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
There is no information to suggest that ZOSTAVAX affects the ability to drive or use machines.

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to off-white compact crystalline plug.
The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi-hazy to
translucent, off-white to pale yellow liquid.
Avoid contact with disinfectants as they may inactivate the vaccine virus.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent provided. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of
infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
Reconstitution instructions
Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe
into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely.
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to
minimise loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to off-white compact crystalline plug.
The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi-hazy to
translucent, off-white to pale yellow liquid.
Avoid contact with disinfectants as they may inactivate the vaccine virus.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent provided. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of
infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
Reconstitution instructions
To attach the needle, it should be firmly placed on the tip of the syringe and secured by rotating a
quarter of a turn (90 ).
Inject the entire content of the solvent syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to
dissolve completely. 
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to
minimise loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing daratumumab was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical observations supporting reduction of free plasma 
light chains in treated patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to the accumulation of fibril 
deposits which disrupts normal tissue structure and function, notably in the heart, kidneys, liver, 
peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and soft tissues; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
No classification changes have been noted since designation. AL amyloidosis is a type of systemic 
amyloidosis where the deposited fibrils are formed by fragments of monoclonal Ig light chains. Affected 
patients may have AL amyloidosis alone or in association with other plasma cell dyscrasias (multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia).  Manifestations depend on the affected tissue and 
commonly involve the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria require the presence of an amyloid-related systemic 
syndrome, positive histology, evidence that the amyloid is light chain-related and evidence of a 
monoclonal plasma cell proliferation disorder. 
The proposed therapeutic indication ““DARZALEX is indicated in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed systemic 
light chain (AL) amyloidosis” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of AL 
amyloidosis”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed with the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the seriousness of the condition. The COMP has 
previously acknowledged that the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to the 
accumulation of fibril deposits which disrupts normal tissue structure and function, notably in the 
heart, kidneys, liver, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and soft tissues. This view is 
retained. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The prevalence estimate was derived from incidence rates multiplied by the duration of the disease 
based on a literature review.  
•  With regards to the duration of the disease, it is noted in particular that the median OS for 
patients with AL amyloidosis ranges from 3.2 years in a German institution study of 1,224 
patients observed from July 2002 to March 2017 to 3.5 years among patients diagnosed in the 
Swedish National Registries from 2010 to 2013 (Dittrich 2019; Weiss 2016). Patients with 
Mayo 2012 stage I or II disease have a median survival from 6 to 10 years (Dittrich 2019). 
•  As for incidence rates, two recent European sources have been found (including UK). The first 
source is a population-level study of AL amyloidosis in the Limousin Region of France from 
2012 through 2016 found a crude annual incidence rate of 12.5 cases per million person-years 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-19.4) (Duhamel 2017). The second source is the UK 
amyloidosis referral searches, which manages 48% of the country’s cases and reporting 
approximately 1,600 cases were documented over 4 years, from 2016 to 2019 (Ravichandran 
2020). Reference is also made to two older publications, in order to point out an increase in 
incidence rates in European sources over time (Magy-Bertrand 2008 and Hemminki 2012).   
Even when multiplying the highest incidence rate of 12.5 cases per million person-years from the 
French Limousin Region to the longest median OS observed for patients with high prognosis, stage I AL 
amyloidosis (approximately 10 years), the prevalence of AL amyloidosis is still 1.25 cases per 10,000 
persons. The sponsor also notes that due to OS being less than 5 years, limited duration prevalence 
may also serve as a proxy for complete. In the French study the 5-year limited duration prevalence of 
AL amyloidosis was estimated as 0.58 cases per 10,000 persons (95% CI: 0.430.73) (Duhamel 
2017).  
At the designation stage the COMP has considered an approximately 1 per 10,000 estimate which is 
line with the above estimate and the proposal from the sponsor to use 1.25 was considered 
acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition.

Existing methods 
There are no authorised products identified by the sponsor for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. As 
both AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma are clonal plasma cell disorders, the treatment approach is 
to use multiple myeloma regimens to achieve rapid, deep, and durable hematologic responses. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor discusses the improved efficacy of their products in comparison to standard of care. 
However, in the absence of authorised treatments for AL amyloidosis, a significant benefit discussion is 
not applicable. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 21 May 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of AL amyloidosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 1.25 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to the accumulation of fibril 
deposits which disrupt normal tissue structure and function, notably in the heart, kidneys, liver, 
peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and soft tissues; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition.   
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Darzalex, daratumumab, for 
treatment of AL amyloidosis (EU/3/18/2020) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

Further to the assessment of a Cumulative review of 
Products Characteristics and sections 2 and 4 of the 
Package Leaflet to include information relating to 
metabolic acidosis and renal tubular acidosis at the 
request of the CHMP. In addition, the name of the 
Portuguese local representative in the Package 
Leaflet has been updated. 
Pharmacovigilance data relating to serious renal adverse 
events as well as serious hypersensitivity, skin and 
haematological adverse events (covering the period 1 April 
2005 to 30 June 2008) it was concluded that metabolic 
acidosis is associated with Zonegran treatment. This 
metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due 
to the inhibitory effect of Zonegran on carbonic anhydrase.

The amounts of which bicarbonate is decreased are usually 
small. The risk of induced metabolic acidosis appears to be 
more frequent and severe in younger patients.  
In addition, a signal of renal tubular acidosis was detected 
in the EudraVigilance database and following the request of 
CHMP the term was included in the listing of adverse 
reactions associated with Zonegran.

and behaviour in association with the use of antiepileptics, 
data available from randomized placebo controlled trials 
and from the post-marketing phase for this class of 
medicines was considered by the CHMP. 
Overall, despite the small number of events seen in the 
clinical trials and the lack of a statistically significant 
increased risk of suicidal behaviour, the analysis of 
randomized placebo controlled trials of antiepileptic drugs 
did not exclude the possibility of an increased risk. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered it necessary to update 
section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL with 
information regarding suicidal ideation and behaviour.

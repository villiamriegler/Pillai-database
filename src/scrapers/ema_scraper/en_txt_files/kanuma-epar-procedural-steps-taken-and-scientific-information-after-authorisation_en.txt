After reviewing the submitted data, the CHMP 
introduce a new posology regimen (higher starting 
dose of 3mg/kg once weekly) based on cumulative 
data from clinical studies and real-world clinical 
practice for patients with Rapidly Progressive LAL 
deficiency presenting within the first six months of 
life. Consequently the dosing information for patients 
with Rapidly Progressive LAL deficiency and 
paediatric and adult patients with LAL deficiency is 
modified. In addition editorial update is made in 
sections 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 following the new 
posology regimen. The Package Leaflet is  updated 
accordingly.

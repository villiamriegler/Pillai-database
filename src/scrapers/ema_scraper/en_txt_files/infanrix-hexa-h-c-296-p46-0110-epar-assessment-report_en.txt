ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION 
Currently approved indication(s): 
Infanrix hexa is indicated for primary and 
booster vaccination of infants against 
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, 
poliomyelitis and disease caused by 
Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
1.  RECOMMENDATION 
Based on the review of the data from study 10PN-PD-DIT-028 (Synflorix, COMPAS study) the 
Rapporteur considers that the benefit-risk balance for Infanrix hexa remains unchanged. Please refer 
to the ongoing Synflorix variation application EMEA/H/C/973/II-52 for detailed information. 
2.  BACKGROUND 
The study reports of 10PN-PD-DIT- 028, i.e. Interim Report Main, Report Main and Annex Report Main, 
are being submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 
190112006. 
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-028 (=COMPAS study) was a phase III, randomized, controlled multicentre study 
conducted in healthy children in Argentina (42 centres), Panama (16 centres) and Colombia (3 
centres) to evaluate Synflorix’ efficacy against community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute otitis 
media (AOM).  
Synflorix (10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine) is a 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine 
composed of Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide serotypes 1,4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 23F 
conjugated to protein D, serotype 18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid and serotype 19F conjugated to 
diphtheria toxoid. 
Infanrix-hexa was not specifically studied in this study. All subjects in the control group of the 
COMPAS study were administered Infanrix hexa at 2, 4 and 6 months of age in addition to a booster 
shot at 15-18 months of age. 
According to Product Information, Infanrix hexa can be administered at the same time as Prevenar 
(pneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed). 
3.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
No immunogenicity results were generated for Infanrix-hexa in the COMPAS study. Since Infanrix-hexa 
was co-administered with other vaccines in the study, the safety analysis performed in the study does 
not relate to the administration of this vaccine alone. The overall safety conclusion from the study was

that Synflorix was generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3+ I dose schedule in 
subjects aged between 6 and 16 weeks at the time of the first vaccination. 
Assessor’s note: for the study design as well as the aim of the different study reports, please refer to 
the ongoing Synflorix variation application EMEA/H/C/973/II-52 for detailed information. 
4.  MAH’S OVERALL CONCLUSION 
GlaxoSmithKline has reviewed the results of this study and has concluded that no changes to the 
Product Information are needed since no data specifically on Infanrix hexa were obtained in this study. 
5.  RAPPORTEUR’s CONCLUSION 
The MAH’s overall conclusion is endorsed.

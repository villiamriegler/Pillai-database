2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In the current variation application, the MAH has  submitted the primary analysis results of paediatric 
study CCTL019C2202 (C2202), which was conducted in compliance with PIP EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-
M01. The MAH considers that the submitted study results do not support a paediatric indication. The aim 
of this application is to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary analysis results 
from study C2202. Study C2202 is the only clinical measure of this PIP, which is one of two opened PIPs 
for Kymriah. The PDCO issued a positive outcome for the final compliance check of EMEA-001654-PIP02-
17-M01 on 24-June-2022.  
Study C2202 is a phase II, single arm, multi-centre open-label trial to determine the safety and efficacy 
of  tisagenlecleucel  in  paediatric  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  mature  B-cell  non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). The primary endpoint of the study was overall response rate (ORR) as determined by 
local investigator assessment, and important secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
This interim analysis covered 33 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel. One enrolled patient died prior 
to infusion. The efficacy analysis set (EAS) consisted of 24 patients <18 years of age, and four patients 
≥18 and <25 years of age. The patients enrolled had relatively advanced disease, with 87.9% at Stage 
III/IV  at  baseline,  a  median  of  2  lines  of  prior  therapy,  18.2%  with  prior  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant (HSCT), a high proportion of refractory patients (30.3%), and 54.5% with Burkitt lymphoma. 
The  data  cutoff  date  (DCO)  for  the  analysis  was  10-Oct-2021,  and  the  median  time  between 
tisagenlecleucel infusion and DCO was 16.1 months.  
At the time of the DCO, the primary endpoint, ORR, was 32.1% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 52.4), 
with 7.1% achieving complete response (CR) and 25% achieving partial response (PR) as best overall 
response  (BOR).  Subgroup  analysis  suggested  a  trend  towards  lower  ORR  in  subjects  with  Burkitt 
lymphoma (20%) versus other histologies (46.1%). ORR in the DLBCL subgroup was 37.5%, and the 
two patients achieving CR in the EAS had DLBCL.  
At the time of DCO, median DOR in subjects who achieved a BOR of CR/PR was not reached due to short 
follow up (2.4 months). Of 9 responders, 3 subjects had an event prior to DCO, 3 subjects were censored 
Assessment report

due to new antineoplastic therapy or HSCT, and 3 subjects were censored due to ongoing without event. 
As of the DCO date, median PFS was 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9) while median OS was 11.4 months 
(95% CI: 3.4, NE). Fourteen subjects, including three subjects with a BOR of PR in the EAS, had died at 
the time of the DCO.  
Considering the single arm nature of study C2202, the limited number of patients included in the trial, 
and  the  relatively  short  follow-up  duration,  the  primary  analysis  results  of  study  C2202  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution.  Particularly,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  estimates  of  time-to-event 
endpoints.  In  addition,  39.4%  of  subjects  received  subsequent  anti-neoplastic  medications  after 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, adding further uncertainty to the estimates of secondary endpoints.  
The primary endpoint result in study C2202 may seem to be somewhat in line with, although numerically 
lower, than the ORR obtained in the adult DLBCL patients enrolled in the pivotal study C2201. In the 
pivotal study, ORR was 53.0% (95%CI: 43.5, 62.4) and CRR was 39.1%. The numerically lower ORR 
observed  in  study  C2202  may  partly  be  explained  by  the  patient  population  enrolled,  having  had  an 
advanced stage of disease and with a high proportion of patients with Burkitt lymphoma, known to have 
a  poor  prognosis.  However,  a  comparison  between  the  two  above-mentioned  studies  should  be 
interpreted with great caution, considering the substantial differences in the study populations, as well 
as the above-mentioned uncertainties and limitations of study C2202. 
Overall, the primary analysis results from study C2202 suggest modest efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in 
the r/r paediatric mature B-cell NHL population in terms of ORR, with potentially greater efficacy in some 
patient subgroups with histologies other than Burkitt lymphoma, including DLBCL. Nonetheless, in the 
absence of an estimate for median DOR, the clinical relevance of the observed ORR cannot be assessed. 
Further, the available data are insufficient to ascertain which histological subgroups may derive clinically 
meaningful  benefit  from  tisagenlecleucel  treatment.  In  conclusion,  given  particularly  the  limited 
enrolment, the single arm nature of the study, and the small histological subgroups, no firm conclusions 
can be drawn regarding the clinical relevance of the observed ORR in the overall the r/r paediatric mature 
B-cell NHL population or in specific histological subgroups.  
The overall safety results were consistent with the existing safety profile of tisagenlecleucel, and no new 
safety findings were observed within the study. However, it is of note that the study population is limited. 
Despite the limitations of the study C2202, inclusion of a short description of the study and its results in 
the SmPC section 5.1 is supported. Considering the high unmet medical need for paediatric patients with 
r/r mature B-cell NHL, this information may be useful for the prescribers. Due to the single-arm nature 
of the study, the treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes such as PFS and OS cannot be isolated. 
Moreover, in the current study these estimates were based on very few patients, and thus additionally 
hampered by uncertainty. Therefore, the inclusion of PFS and OS outcomes in the SmPC is not endorsed.  
The PI has been updated by the MAH according to the CAT/CHMP comments in the RSI. The proposed 
updates to the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1, and PL section 2 are considered acceptable.   
The benefit-risk balance of Kymriah remains positive.

5. Introduction 
Kymriah (INN: tisagenlecleucel, product code CTL019) was approved in the Europe Union (EU) via the 
centralised procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090 on 22-Aug-2018 and is indicated for the treatment of: 
Paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  up  to  and  including  25  years  of  age  with  B  cell  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  that  is  refractory,  in  relapse  post-transplant  or  in  second  or  later 
relapse. 
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy. 
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy. 
Tisagenlecleucel  is  a  second-generation  chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)-based  gene  therapy  product 
that  contains  autologous genetically  modified  T-cells.  The  product is  manufactured  from  the  patient’s 
own peripheral blood T-cells, which are transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector that encodes a CAR 
directed against human CD19 on the surface of B-cells. The CAR is comprised of a murine single chain 
antibody  fragment  that  recognises  CD19  and  is  fused  to  intracellular  signalling  domains  from  the 
costimulatory receptor 4-1BB (CD137) and the T-cell receptor associated CD3 zeta complex. The CD3 
zeta component is critical for initiating T-cell activation and anti-tumour activity, while 4-1BB enhances 
the activation, expansion, and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. Upon binding to CD19 expressing cells, 
the CAR transmits a signal promoting T-cell activation, expansion, and acquisition of effector functions 
of tisagenlecleucel, such as cytotoxicity and elimination of CD19 expressing target cells. This allows the 
genetically  modified  T-cells  to  specifically  target  and  destroy  CD19-positive  malignant  B-cells  in  an 
antigen dependent, but major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent manner. 
The clinical efficacy and safety data presented in the initial marketing authorisation (MA) application for 
the DLBCL indication were obtained from the open-label, multi-center, single-arm phase 2 study C2201 
in adult patients with r/r DLBCL.  
This  type  II  variation,  category  C.I.4,  corresponds  to  the  submission  of  paediatric  study  results 
performed in compliance with paediatric investigation plan (PIP) Kymriah EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01. 
Study CCTL019C2202 (C2202) is the only clinical measure of this PIP, which is one of two opened PIPs 
for Kymriah. Study C2202 (BIANCA) is a phase II, single arm, multi-center open label trial to determine 
the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 
The MAH considers that the submitted study results do not support a paediatric indication. The aim of 
the current application is to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary analysis results 
from study C2202 with DCO date of 10-Oct-2021. No updated RMP is proposed with this application. The 
PDCO issued a positive outcome for the final compliance check of EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01 on 24-
June-2022.

6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
6.1 Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Title:  A  Phase  II,  single  arm,  multi-center,  open-label  trial  to  determine  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(BIANCA) 
Secondary objectives (Table 8) included: 
to characterise the in vivo cellular kinetics (levels, expansion, persistence) of tisagenlecleucel cells into 
target tissues (blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, CSF, and other tissues if available) as measured by 
qPCR in relation to safety and efficacy; and 
to  characterise  the  presence  of  pre-existing  and  treatment  induced  immunogenicity  and  impact  on 
cellular kinetics and response. 
Exploratory endpoints included cellular kinetic parameters by use of tocilizumab and by CRS grade. 
Dose:  Tisagenlecleucel  was  given  as  a  single  IV  infusion.  There  was  no  clinical  experience  on  dosing 
paediatric  subjects  with  B-cell  NHL  with  tisagenlecleucel  prior  to  conducting  Study  C2202.  The 
recommended dose was based on experience gained from studies in paediatric and young adult subjects 
with r/r ALL (studies B2202 and B2205J). Based on the totality of the evidence from dose-safety, dose-
efficacy, and exposure-response analyses, and the positive benefit-risk observed across the broad range 
of doses administered, subjects received one of two possible dose ranges determined by the subject’s 
weight during the leukapheresis visit or at baseline: 
Subjects ≤ 50 kg: 0.2 to 5 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight 
Subjects > 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
It was planned to enroll approximately 35 subjects (≤25 years, ≥ 6kg) with an aim to infuse at least 26 
evaluable subjects (comprising at least 18 paediatric subjects <18 years) with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL 
(Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL and GZL).

Assessor’s comment: 
Study C2202 is the sole clinical study in an agreed paediatric investigational plan (PIP) (EMEA-001654-
PIP02-17, EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01) concerning tisagenlecleucel treatment in paediatrics<18 years 
and ≥6kg with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL. The overall study design is in line with the agreed PIP. The 
selected doses in study C2202 were identical to the approved dose range for paediatric and young adult 
B-cell ALL. Clinical pharmacology results are described in the Clinical overview (Module 2.5) only, and 
no update of Summary of Clinical pharmacology (Module 2.7.2) has been provided. 
Peripheral  blood  samples  were  used  to  assess  tisagenlecleucel  cellular  kinetics  using  qPCR.  Flow 
cytometry  methods  were  used  to  determine  CAR-positive  cell  levels.  Humoral  and  cellular 
immunogenicity  were  also  assessed.  According  to  the  Applicant,  study  C2202  was  conducted  in  full 
compliance with current Good Clinical Practices. 
Analytical Methods 
Assays  utilised  for  various  PK  assessments  included  qPCR  and  flow  cytometric  analysis  to  detect 
tisagenlecleucel-positive  cells  in  peripheral  blood,  bone  marrow,  and/or  CSF,  as  well  as  assays  for 
determination of rituximab and tocilizumab are summarised below.

methods has been assessed previously. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
According to the MAH, the cellular kinetic samples were collected in all participants at the visits defined 
in  the  protocol  assessment  schedule  (Table  below).  Peripheral  blood  samples  were  used  to  assess 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022

tisagenlecleucel  cellular  kinetics  using  qPCR.  Flow  cytometry  methods  were  used  to  determine  CAR-
positive  cell  levels.  Humoral  and  cellular  immunogenicity  were  also  assessed.  PK  samples  were  also 
obtained  for  tocilizumab  PK  in  tocilizumab-treated  subjects  with  CRS  as  well  as  baseline  rituximab 
concentrations in subjects who received rituximab prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Table 2. Assessment Schedule (Study C2202 protocol, selected parts of Table 8-1) 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the total viable cell count infused, the total infused CAR-
positive viable T cells, and the total infused weight-adjusted CAR-positive viable T cells. 
The  cellular  kinetic  analysis  data  set  (CKAS)  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  received  an  infusion  of 
tisagenlecleucel (FAS) who also provided at least one valid cellular kinetic concentration. Tisagenlecleucel 
concentrations  in  peripheral  blood,  bone  marrow,  and  CSF,  if  available,  were  listed,  graphed,  and 
summarised by time points as assessed by qPCR for the CAR transgene levels and for CAR-positive viable 
cells by flow cytometry for CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, and CD3+/CD8+ cells (exploratory only). 
Cellular  kinetic  parameters  (Table  2),  along  with  other  relevant  cellular  kinetic  parameters,  were 
estimated if feasible, from the individual concentration versus time profiles using a non-compartmental 
approach within the modeling program Phoenix® (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA) and reported by best 
overall  response  (BOR)  category  and  additionally  by  maximum  CRS  grade,  use  of  tocilizumab,  and 
tisagenlecleucel  treatment-induced  or  -boosted  anti-tisagenlecleucel  antibodies.  Tocilizumab  PK  was 
Assessment report

summarised by time point and by maximum CRS grade for the TPAS (i.e. all subjects who took at least 
one dose of tocilizumab and provided at least one tocilizumab PK concentration). 
B  cell  levels  over  time  will  be  summarised  according  to  rituximab  concentration  divided  into  suitable 
categories. Graphical analysis and summary statistics may be used to explore the relationship between 
B cells, transgene persistence and clinical response. 
Table 3. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters (CSR, Table 9-1) 
The estimation of Tlast is influenced by multiple factors such as duration of follow up and limit of quantification which 
may impact these conclusions, and longer persistence is anticipated with longer follow-up. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  MAH  has  used  standard  non-compartmental  analyses  (NCA)  to  describe  cellular  kinetics  of 
tisagenlecleucel in patients with r/r DLBCL in study C2202, which is acceptable. 
Immunogenicity is further addressed in the efficacy sections below. 
6.2 Results 
Demographics 
Thirty-three subjects (29 patients [86.8%] aged < 18 years) provided an evaluable cellular kinetic profile 
and were included in the CKAS. Six subjects (15.8%, all aged <18 years) received at least one dose of 
tocilizumab  and  were  included  in  the  tocilizumab  PK  analysis  set  (TPAS).  The  median  time  from 
leukapheresis to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 62.0 days (range: 39 to 125 days). For further details on 
study population, see the efficacy section. 
Dose 
An overview of administered doses in given in Table 15. For subjects weighing >50 kg the median (range) 
administered dose of tisagenlecleucel was 1.26x108 CAR-positive viable T cells (0.30 to 2.38x108). For 
subjects weighing ≤50 kg the median (range) dose was 1.90x106 cells/kg (0.40 to 7.30x106 cells/kg). 
All patients, except for one, received tisagenlecleucel within the targeted dose range. 
Similar doses were administered in the paediatric subgroup. However, for the patients >50kg, subjects 
≥18 years were infused with a higher median dose (1.5; range: 0.7 to 2.1x108 cells) than subjects <18 
years of age (1.18; range: 0.3 to 2.38 x108 cells). Similarly, for the patients ≤ 50 kg, subjects ≥ 18 
years were infused with a higher median dose (2.40x106 cells/kg, N=1) than 1.70 for subjects <18 years 
of age (range: 0.4 to 7.30x106 cells/kg).

Pharmacokinetic results 
Cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel transgene levels by qPCR in peripheral blood, based on 
disease response 
Following infusion, tisagenlecleucel typically exhibits an initial rapid expansion phase achieving maximal 
expansion (Cmax) followed by a bi-exponential decline (Figure 1).

tisagenlecleucel (CKAS), by best overall response (C2202 CSR, Figure 14.2-9.1) 
Cellular PK parameters by best overall response are presented in Table 4. Overall, similar exposure of 
CAR  T  cells  between  responders  and  non-responders  were  observed.  To  note,  the  inter-individual 
variability associated with the parameters were high. The Tmax was approximately 13 days in responders 
(n=12) and non-responders (n=17), and ~11 days in the subject with unknown response. CAR-positive 
viable T cells demonstrated persistence (Tlast) of the tisagenlecleucel transgene for up to a maximum 
of 562 days in responders and a maximum of 357 days in non-responders. Similarly, the geometric mean 
T1/2 was longer in responders compared to non-responders. 
The maximal expansion values in three of four subjects (two responders and two non-responders) who 
were  ≥18  years  of  age  were  within  the  range  of  values  observed  from  overall  population  (n=3;  941-

derived.

Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH has provided descriptive cellular kinetics data obtained in PIP study C2202 from 29 paediatric 
and  four  young  adult  patients  with  B-cell  NHL.  The  administered  doses  were  within  the  dose  ranges 
approved for treatment of B-cell ALL in paediatric and young adult patients. Results are reported for the 
total CKAS (i.e. including also the four adults). 
The geometric mean Cmax was higher in responders (CR/PR, N=12) than non-responders (SD and PD, 
N=19) based on BOR after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The geometric mean AUC0-28d was similar between

responders  and  non-responders.  CAR-positive  viable  T  cells  demonstrated  persistence  of  the 
tisagenlecleucel transgene for a maximum of 562 days in responders and 357 days in non-responders. 
Observed AUC0-28d and Cmax were comparable to that described for adult r/r DLBCL patients (study 
C2201), with slightly shorter Tmax in adults (~13d vs ~9d, respectively). 
Any differences observed should be interpreted with caution due to high inter-individual variability and 
overlapping expansion ranges observed between responders and non-responders. Tlast and t1/2 (reflecting 
persistence) should not be directly compared between treatment groups and indications because both 
are dependent on the time of data cut of/follow up period. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters by use of tocilizumab and CRS grade 
Exploratory endpoints included cellular kinetic parameters by use of tocilizumab (Table 5) and by CRS 
grade (Table 6). Considering the high inter-individual variability and overlapping expansion ranges, any 
exposure differences should be interpreted with caution. 
The  geometric  mean  Cmax  was  approximately  2-fold  higher  when  tocilizumab  was  administered  for 
management  of  CRS  (n=10)  compared  to  the  expansion  in  subjects  who  did  not  receive  tocilizumab 
(n=20). (Table 5). Subjects that experienced CRS generally have greater expansion and generally these 
patients  require  tocilizumab.  Therefore,  the  higher  expansion  following  tocilizumab  cannot  be  directly 
attributed to the use of tocilizumab. Transgene continues to expand and persist following tocilizumab 
infusion. 
The geometric mean Cmax in subjects with grade 1/2 CRS (n=17) was approximately 3-fold higher than 
the  patients  with  no  CRS  (n=10)  (Table  6).  To  note,  only  three  patients  experienced  ≥grade  3  CRS, 
therefore, the cellular kinetic parameters in this category with subjects that either did not experience 
CRS or low-grade CRS (grade 1 or 2) cannot be compared.

Scatter plots (not shown) for net response Geometric mean CAR T cells expansion was similar between 
responders and non-responders and persistence of CAR T cells was observed for up to 562 days. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Higher expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients experiencing 
grade 1 or 2 CRS, relative to patients not experiencing CRS. Only three patients experienced grade≥3 
CRS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 17/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Higher expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients who required 
tocilizumab to  treat  CRS.  CAR  T-cell  activation  is  accompanied  by  extensive  release  of  toxic  levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, hence patients with higher expansion could be prone to develop treatment-
requiring  CRS.  Hence,  the  true  influence  of  tocilizumab  on  expansion  cannot  be  ascertained  directly 
since, the observation may have been confounded as tocilizumab is given for CRS treatment and CRS is 
associated with higher expansion. 
6.3 Discussion 
The cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in 29 paediatric and four young adult patients with CD19+ r/r 
mature B-cell NHL and who have relapsed following one or more therapies (study C2202, EMEA-001654-
PIP02-17-M01),  have  been  described.  The  geometric  mean  Cmax  was  higher  in  responders  (CR/PR, 
N=12)  than  non-responders  (SD  and  PD,  N=19)  based  on  BOR  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion.  The 
geometric  mean  AUC0-28d  was  similar  between  responders  and  non-responders.  Longer  persistence 
was observed in responders vs. non-responders, however, the measures of persistence (Tlast and t1/2) 
should not be directly compared because they are both dependent on the time of data cut of/follow up 
period. 
Observed AUC0-28d and Cmax were comparable to that described for adult r/r DLBCL patients (study 
C2201), with slightly shorter Tmax in adults. 
The impact of CRS and tocilizumab on cellular kinetics were assessed using cellular kinetic parameters 
determined from NCA. Higher expansion of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients experiencing 
grade 1-2 CRS, relative to patients not experiencing CRS. Higher expansion CAR-positive viable T cells 
was also seen in patients who required tocilizumab to treat CRS. Importantly, CAR T-cell activation is 
accompanied  by  extensive  release  of  toxic  levels  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  hence  patients  with 
higher expansion could be prone to develop treatment-requiring CRS. Consequently, the true influence 
of  tocilizumab  on  expansion  cannot  be  ascertained  directly  since,  the  observation  may  have  been 
confounded as tocilizumab is given for CRS treatment and CRS is associated with higher expansion. 
The  proposed  update  of  the  SmPC  section  4.2  Paediatric  population  is  supported.  No  changes  are 
proposed in section 5.2 which is acceptable. 
7. Clinical Efficacy aspects 
7.1 Methods – analysis of data submitted 
7.1.1 Study Design 
Study C2202 (BIANCA) is a Phase 2, single arm, multicenter open-label trial to determine the safety and 
efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), who have relapsed after 1 or more prior therapies or have primary refractory 
disease (Table 7).

Table 7. Overview of Study C2202 
a) Aggressive B-cell NHL subtypes (Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL, GZL), in addition, FL subjects may also 
have been treated; age ≤ 25 years; r/r to 1 or more lines of prior therapies. b) Previous leukapheresis collection or 
during screening. c) Administered as applicable: fludarabine (30 mg/m2 IV daily for 4 days) and cyclophosphamide 
(500 mg/m2 IV daily for 2 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine). d) Subjects that discontinued treatment 
and follow-up phase early (post-infusion but prior to M24 visit) continued in Annual Follow-up or Survival Follow-up 
until End of Study (until all subjects who received tisagenlecleucel completed 2 years of post-treatment phase or 
discontinued early). e) Conducted under a separate destination protocol 
Figure 2. Study Design, C2202 
The  study  had  the  following  phases:  Consent,  Screening,  Pre-treatment,  Treatment  and  Follow-up( 
Figure 2). Screening began after signing the IRB/EC-approved study ICF. Leukapheresis material was 
either  collected  after  signing  informed  consent  or  was  historical  non-mobilized  leukapheresis  material 
collected at an appropriately certified leukapheresis centre and was of acceptable quality. Enrolment was

defined as the point at which a subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and the subject’s leukapheresis 
material was received at a Novartis manufacturing facility and accepted for manufacturing. 
In the Pre-treatment phase, the subject could undergo optional bridging therapy of investigator’s choice 
as needed, and lymphodepleting chemotherapy completed 2-14 days before tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Pre-treatment  began  at  enrolment  until  Day-1  (pre-infusion  visit)  and  included  manufacturing  of 
tisagenlecleucel. Tisagenlecleucel cell product was prepared and released by the manufacturing facility 
to the study site approximately 4-6 weeks after manufacturing commenced, provided all required safety 
and quality release criteria had been met. 
The Treatment and Follow-up Phase included tisagenlecleucel infusion (Day 1) and safety and efficacy 
follow-up until all subjects completed 24 months on study or discontinued early. For the purpose of close 
safety  monitoring  of  subjects,  in  particular  those  with  aggressive  disease  subtypes,  and  for  safely 
onboarding new sites, a staggered approach was utilized at each site for the first 3 subjects. A mandatory 
14-day waiting period had to elapse between infusing the first and second and between the second and 
third subjects. After the third subject at a site had been infused, subjects could be infused at the site 
without staggering. The same staggering approach was applied at the study level for subjects diagnosed 
with Burkitt leukemia. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at regular intervals until end of 
study. Efficacy  assessments  were  based  on  International  Pediatric  Non-Hodgkin  Lymphoma  Response 
Criteria  (Sandlund  et  al.,  2015).  The  latest  efficacy  assessment  after  bridging  therapy  and  prior  to 
infusion was to be used as baseline. 
Both a primary and final analysis were planned. The primary analysis was based on all evaluable subjects 
with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL and was conducted when all evaluable subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell 
NHL had been infused and followed for at least 6 months from study Day 1 or discontinued early as well 
as at least 50% of those subjects having a follow-up of at least 9 months from tisagenlecleucel infusion 
or early discontinuation. The final analysis is to be conducted once all subjects complete the study. 
The end of study (EOS) was defined as when all subjects complete the protocol-defined 2-year Treatment 
and  Follow-up  phase  (i.e.,  last  subject  last  Month  24  Visit)  and/or  discontinue  early.  After  EOS,  all 
subjects are to be asked to continue in a post-study long-term follow-up under a separate destination 
protocol (CCTL019A2205B), for up to 15 years post-infusion. 
7.1.2 Study Participants 
The target patient population participating in the study included male and female, pediatric patients (< 
18 years of age, weighing at least 6 kg), adolescent and young adult patients (≤ 25 years of age) with 
CD19+  r/r  mature  B-cell  NHL,  including  broad  histological  aggressive  subtypes  based  on  the  WHO 
classification (Swerdlow et al., 2016), such as Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL, GZL, and FL who had 
relapsed after 1 or more prior therapies or were primary refractory (had not achieved a CR or PR after 
the first line of therapy). Patients who had progressed after prior allogeneic and autologous HSCT were 
allowed to participate in the study. 
Protocol  Amendment  1  introduced  some  major  changes  with  regards  to  the  study  population  (see 
Conduct of the Study for more details): 
Allowing  for  inclusion  of  subjects  with  Burkitt  leukemia  who  either  have  measurable  disease  by 
radiological criteria or bone marrow involvement > 25% (modification of inclusion criteria 2 and 5) 
Increasing subject age from < 18 to ≤ 25 years (modification of inclusion criteria 3) 
Removing  absolute  lymphocyte  count  and  CD3+  T  cell  count  requirements  (modification  of  inclusion 
criteria 7) 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 20/64 
 
 
 
Key Inclusion Criteria: 
Histologically confirmed (local evaluation) mature B-cell NHL including the following subtypes; 
Burkitt  Lymphoma  and  Burkitt  Leukemia  (L3  B-cell  ALL)  (Burkitt  lymphoma),  DLBCL,  PMBCL, 
GZL,  and  FL.  Patients  with  B-cell  NHL  associated  with  Nijmegen  breakage  syndrome  were 
allowed. 
Sufficient  formalin-fixed,  paraffin-embedded  tumor  sample  must  have  been  available  for 
correlative analysis. A recent tumor sample obtained for the study must have been submitted; 
however,  if  not  clinically  feasible,  an  archival  biopsy  from  the  most  recent  relapse  or  other 
historical  sample  may  have  been  submitted  instead.  Excisional  biopsies  should  have  been 
submitted wherever possible, or if not possible, a core needle biopsy. Fine needle aspiration was 
not suitable. 
Patient ≤ 25 years of age and weighing at least 6 kg at the time of screening 
Patients who had relapsed after 1 or more prior therapies (including allogeneic and autologous 
hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant)  or  were  primary  refractory  (had  not  achieved  a  CR  or  PR 
after the first line of therapy) 
Had measurable disease by radiological criteria at the time of screening. Patients with Burkitt 
leukemia who did not meet radiological criteria must have had bone marrow involvement of > 
25%. 
Karnofsky (age ≥ 16 years) or Lansky (age < 16 years) performance status ≥ 60. 
Adequate bone marrow reserve without transfusion and organ function. 
Had leukapheresis material of non-mobilised cells accepted for manufacturing (assessment and 
shipping took place after documented confirmation of all other eligibility criteria was received). 
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
Prior anti-CD19, engineered T cell, or gene therapy 
Allogenic HSCT < 3 months prior to screening and ≤ 4 months prior to infusion 
Presence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD in patients who received prior allogenic HSCT 
Prior  diagnosis  of  malignancy  other  than  study  indication  and  not  disease-free  for  5  years, 
including B-cell NHL in the content of PTLD-associated lymphomas 
Clinically significant infection 
Active  neurological  autoimmune  or  inflammatory  disorders  (e.g.,  Guillain-Barre  syndrome, 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) 
Active CNS involvement by malignancy. However, patients with history of CNS disease that had 
been effectively treated were eligible. 
Concomitant genetic syndromes associated with bone marrow failure status, except for Down syndrome 
7.1.3 Treatments 
Bridging therapy 
While  awaiting  completion  of  tisagenlecleucel  product  manufacturing,  subjects  who  needed  additional 
(bridging)  therapy  to  control  their  disease,  based  on  the  extent  of  the  disease  burden  and  per 
investigator’s discretion, may have received appropriate treatment. It was recommended that bridging 
therapy should have been completed 2 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Lymphodepleting therapy 
Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, each subject was to undergo lymphodepletion, unless the subject had 
a  significant  cytopenia  (e.g.,  WBC  <  1000  cells/μL,  absolute  lymphocyte  count  <  200/μL)  or  any 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 21/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
condition that, in the investigator’s opinion, precluded lymphodepletion. The preferred regimen was as 
follows: 
Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 IV daily for 4 days) 
Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 IV daily for 2 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine) 
If the subject had a history of grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide or of resistance to a 
cyclophosphamide-containing regimen, then the following regimen was recommended: 
Cytarabine (500 mg/m2 IV daily for 2 days) 
Etoposide (150 mg/m2 IV daily for 3 days starting with the first dose of cytarabine) 
Investigational drug (Tisagenlecleucel) 
Tisagenlecleucel was administered as a single IV infusion, after optional bridging and LD chemotherapy. 
The proposed dose range of tisagenlecleucel was based on weight at the time of leukapheresis: 
Subjects ≤ 50 kg: 0.2 to 5 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight 
Subjects > 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
Concomitant treatment 
Clinically  significant  prescription  and  nonprescription  medication,  excluding  vitamins,  herbal  and 
nutritional supplements, procedure-related (inpatient or outpatient) medications and therapy taken by 
the subject during the 30 days prior to screening through end of study was recorded. During selected 
study  phases,  concomitant  medication  collection  was  modified  to  capture  tisagenlecleucel-related 
toxicity, severity, interventions, and response/resolution following intervention.  
Medication restrictions prior to leukapheresis 
To stabilise the disease prior to leukapheresis, subjects could receive therapeutic doses of steroids or 
low-dose daily chemotherapy for up to 1 week. Both treatments must have been stopped > 72 hours 
prior to leukapheresis. 
Medication restrictions prior to and post-tisagenlecleucel infusion 
The  following  medications  or  therapies  were  restricted  in  study  C2202:  Steroids  or  other 
immunosuppressant  drugs,  antibodies  (including  anti-CD20  therapy),  CNS  disease  prophylaxis  or 
intrathecal therapy, radiation therapy, live vaccines, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, 
antiproliferative therapies other than lymphodepletion (including low dose daily or weekly maintenance 
chemotherapy), short-acting drugs used to treat primary disease, and GVHD therapies.

Table 9. Exploratory Objectives and related endpoints 
Disease characterization at baseline and evaluation of efficacy during the study relied on the following: 
Imaging,  either:  PET-CT  with  diagnostic  CT,  PET-CT  with  non-diagnostic  CT  +  dedicated 
diagnostic CT, or dedicated FDG PET with dedicated diagnostic CT 
Bone marrow biopsy or aspirate 
CSF cytology 
Physical examination findings/cytology/biopsy evaluation 
Efficacy  evaluations  were  based  on  the  International  Pediatric  NHL  Response  Criteria  (Sandlund  et  al 
2015). The latest efficacy assessment after bridging therapy and prior to infusion was used as baseline. 
7.1.5 Sample Size 
It was planned to enroll approximately 35 subjects, with an aim to infuse at least 26 evaluable subjects 
with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL (Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL and GZL) for the primary ORR analysis. 
Evaluable subjects are subjects with measurable disease at baseline, where baseline was defined as the 
disease  assessment  prior  to  infusion  and  after  any  optional  bridging  chemotherapy.  The  primary 
objective of the study was to estimate response rate and therefore the sample size was not based on 
Assessment report

power calculation. In addition, due to the expansion of the permitted age range of patients enrolled (PIP 
EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01, EMA decision P/0323/2019) it was also specified in amendment 1 that at 
least 18 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint should be < 18 years. There was no pre-specified 
target for the number of FL subjects to be treated because it was an extremely rare and indolent disease. 
However, enrolment in this subtype was open until at least 26 subjects, including at least 18 paediatric 
subjects, with the aggressive subtypes for primary analysis had been treated. 
7.1.6 Statistical Methods 
General Information on Data Analysis 
All analyses were performed by Novartis Oncology Biostatistics and Statistical Programming personnel 
or designated CRO. 
Analysis Sets 
Screened set: all subjects who signed ICF and were screened 
Enrolled set: A subject was defined as enrolled when the patient met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
leukapheresis material was received and accepted for manufacturing 
EAS:  all  subjects  with  aggressive  r/r  B-cell  NHL  who  received  an  infusion of  tisagenlecleucel  and had 
measurable disease at baseline 
FAS and safety set: all subjects who received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel 
CKAS: subjects in the FAS who provided at least 1 valid cellular kinetic concentration 
TPAS:  all  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  tocilizumab  and  provided  at  least  1  tocilizumab  PK 
concentration 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  all  evaluable  subjects  with  aggressive  r/r  B-cell  NHL  and 
measurable  disease  at  baseline.  The  analysis  was  to  be  conducted  when  all  these  subjects  had  been 
infused and followed for at least 6 months from study Day 1 or discontinued early as well as at least 
50% of those subjects having a follow-up of at least 9 months.  
A subject was considered to have a BOR of CR if they had CR, as overall disease response for at least 1 
of the assessments. A subject had a BOR of PR if at least 1 overall response of PR was available and the 
subject would not have qualified for CR. A subject had a BOR of MR if at least 1 overall disease response 
of MR was available and the subject would not have qualified for CR or PR. A BOR of NR was declared 
when at least 1 NR assessment was available earliest at 4 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion and the 
subject would not have qualified for CR, PR, or MR. A subject had a BOR of PD if the PD was observed < 
28 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion and the subject would not have qualified for CR, PR, MR, or NR. 
If a subject would not have qualified for CR, PR, MR, NR, or PD, then their BOR was Unknown. Subjects 
who were of unknown clinical response were treated as non-responders.  
The ORR along with the 95% exact Clopper-Pearson CIs was summarized in subjects with aggressive r/r 
B-cell NHL in the EAS. 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed for the primary endpoint. In particular, the primary analysis 
was also performed on the Enrolled Set and FAS using the same methodology. Subgroup analyses of the 
primary  endpoint  were  also  performed  if  at  least  5  subjects  were  present  in  each  subgroup,  for 
parameters  such  as  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  disease  subtypes,  prior  response  status,  stage  of 
disease at BL, use of prior rituximab, prognostic factors, autologous HSCT, surgery before infusion.

Secondary endpoints 
No formal hypothesis testing was planned for the secondary efficacy endpoints DOR, EFS, RFS, PFS, and 
OS.  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  analyses  were  only  performed  if  at  least  1  event  was  observed;  otherwise, 
descriptive analyses were used.  
For DOR, in case a subject did not have progression or death due to underlying cancer prior to DCO, 
DOR was censored at the date of the last adequate response assessment (not missing or unknown) on 
or  prior  to  the  earliest  censoring  event  (ongoing,  LTFU,  withdrew  consent,  new  anticancer  therapy 
including HSCT). Distribution of DOR was estimated using the KM method in which death due to reason 
other than underlying cancer was censored. For HSCT, the date of HSCT was considered the censoring 
date. 
For  EFS,  subjects  were  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last  adequate  response  assessment  (where  not 
missing or unknown) on or prior to the earliest censoring event: ongoing without event, LTFU, withdrawal 
of consent, or received an HSCT. The distribution function of EFS was estimated using the KM method.  
For RFS, subjects were censored at the last date RFS was not missing or unknown, with censoring events 
including:  ongoing  without  event,  LTFU,  withdrawal  of  consent,  or  received  new  anticancer  therapy 
including  HSCT.  The  distribution  function  of  RFS  was  estimated  using  the  KM  method.  A  sensitivity 
analyses excluding HSCT as a censoring reason was performed using the same methodology. 
For PFS, censoring was performed at the date of the last adequate response assessment that was not 
missing or unknown on or prior to the earliest censoring event (ongoing without event, LTFU, withdrawal 
of consent, new anticancer therapy including HSCT). PFS was estimated using the KM method. 
For OS, in case a subject was not known to have died at the DCO date, the subject was censored at the 
last contact date, which was defined at the latest date the subject was known to be alive. The censoring 
reason could be ongoing without event or LTFU. Subjects were considered as LTFU if the time between 
their last contact date and the analysis cutoff date was ≥ 105 days. The distribution function of OS was 
estimated using the KM  method. As a sensitivity analysis, OS was also summarized censoring for HSCT. 
Exploratory variables 
Biomarkers 
The FAS was used for all biomarker analyses including all subjects with available biomarker data, except 
where  assessment  of  associations  of  biomarker  and  safety  data  were  made  using  the  safety  set. 
Depending on the availability of data, specific data parameters could have been summarized or listed. 
Biomarkers analysed included: CD19 expression, B-, T-, and NK-cell levels, and cytokine levels as well 
as other soluble immune factors.  
Feasibility to collect T cells from paediatric B-cell NHL subjects and manufacture tisagenlecleucel product 
The number of leukapheresis attempts on study for each subject to obtain an acceptable leukapheresis 
material was summarised. 
7.2 Results 
7.2.1 Participant Flow 
The primary analysis was based on data collected from study C2202 up to the DCO date of 10-Oct-2021. 
An interim study database lock for this analysis was performed on 24-Dec-2021. At the time of the DCO, 
38 subjects with r/r B-cell NHL had been screened. Four of these subjects could not be enrolled due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 26/64 
 
 
 
screen failure (n=3) and technical problems (n=1). Thus, at the DCO, 34 subjects (89.5%) were enrolled, 
with  33  subjects  (97.1%)  infused  and  1  subject  (2.9%)  who  discontinued  treatment  prior  to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion due to death. 17 of the 33 (51.5%) infused subjects had ongoing follow-up at 
the time of DCO and 16 subjects (48.5 %) discontinued treatment and primary follow-up due to death. 
The median time from enrolment to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 35.0 days (range: 7 to 62 days). The 
minimum of 7 days was observed for 3 subjects: 1 subject who was re-screened and 2 subjects who had 
their  leukapheresis  material  accepted  for  manufacturing  earlier,  but  only  confirmed  enrolment  in  the 
study  7  days  prior  to  receiving  infusion  of  tisagenlecleucel.  The  median  time  from  leukapheresis  to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion was 62.0 days (range: 39 to 125 days). Median time between tisagenlecleucel 
infusion and DCO date was 16.1 months (range: 6.1 to 29.6 months). Similar results were observed in 
the subgroup of subjects aged < 18 years.

7.2.2 Recruitment 
Study  C2202  was  carried  out  in  twenty-four  centres  across  14  countries:  USA  (6  centres);  Australia, 
France,  Italy,  Japan,  and  Spain  (2  centres  each);  Austria,  Canada,  Denmark,  Finland,  Germany,  The 
Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom (1 centre each). The study initiation date was 15-Feb-
2019 (first subject first visit). The DCO date for the current, primary analysis, was 10-Oct-2021. The 
study is ongoing.  
In the FAS, the median time from screening to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 57 days (range: 8-108) 
and median time from enrolment to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 35 days (range: 7-62). The median 
time between tisagenlecleucel infusion and DCO was 16.1 months (range: 6.1 to 29.6 months)

7.2.3 Conduct of the Study 
The study protocol was amended once, on 14-Jan-2020, to align with an approved PIP modification. At 
the time of the amendment, 24 sites had been initiated and 8 patients enrolled. This assessment report 
describes the study conduct as amended. The key features of the amendment are listed below: 
Table 12. Protocol Amendments 
In total, five patients between 18 and 25 years of age were enrolled. No patients with Burkitt leukemia 
were enrolled in the study.  
Table 13. Protocol Deviations (FAS) 
In  terms  of  changes in planned  analysis,  no  subjects  with  FL  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  planned 
analyses related to FL were not conducted. Protocol deviations are presented in Table 12.

Assessor’s comment: 
The  protocol  was  amended  once,  on  14-Jan-2020,  to  align  with  PDCO-approved  modification  of  PIP 
EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01  (EMA  decision  P/0323/2019).  The  changes  implemented  in  this 
amendment concerned updates of the inclusion criteria to allow patients between 18 and 25 years of 
age as well as patients with Burkitt leukaemia and are considered acceptable. 
A total of eight subjects (24%) experienced protocol deviations (Table 12). Notably, one patient received 
more than one infusion of tisagenlecleucel, and one patient received a dose above the target dose range.

Table 15. Primary Disease History (FAS) 
Assessor’s comment: 
The FAS consisted mostly of subjects with Burkitt lymphoma (54.5%, 18/33) or DLBCL (30.3%, 10/33) 
(Table 15). No subjects with FL were enrolled in the study, despite having been included in the inclusion 
criteria. The population enrolled in the study had a relatively advanced stage of disease, reflective of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 30/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
r/r mature B-cell NHL population defined by the inclusion criteria. In the FAS, 87.9% (29/33 subjects) 
had Stage III/IV at baseline, subjects had a median of 2 (range: 1 to 3) lines of prior therapy, 18.2% 
(6/33  subjects)  had received  prior  HSCT.  In  addition,  there  was  a  significant proportion  of  refractory 
patients  (30.3%  refractory  and  15.2%  primary  refractory),  as  well  as  a  high  proportion  of  the  more 
aggressive  B-cell  NHL  subtype  of  Burkitt  lymphoma.  Overall,  the  above-mentioned  disease 
characteristics  and  subtypes  indicate  a  poor  prognosis.  Similar  characteristics  were  observed  in  the 
subgroup of subjects aged <18 years.  
In pivotal study C2201, the adult patients with DLBCL also had advanced disease, with 76.5% with stage 
III/IV disease, a median of 3 lines of prior therapy, 48.7% who had received SCT, and 54.8% who were 
refractory to the last line of therapy in the infused set. A key difference between the enrolled populations 
the current study and the pivotal study in adults is the inclusion of histological subtypes beyond DLBCL 
in study C2202.  
7.2.5 Treatment 
Exposure to study treatment 
Table 16. Tisagenlecleucel dose administration (Safety Set) 
[1] The target dose range was 0.2 to 5.0 x106 autologous CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight (for subjects 
≤ 50 kg), or 0.1 to 2.5 x108 autologous CAR-positive viable T cells (for subjects > 50 kg). Only the first tisagenlecleucel 
infusion was presented for each subject. The weight for manufacturing was calculated by dividing the total infused 
CAR-positive  viable  T  cell  count  (10^8)  by  the  infused  CAR-positive  viable  T  cells  count  per  kg  (106/kg)  and 
multiplying by 100. If one of the cell counts was missing the last non-missing weight prior to infusion from vital signs 
was  used  as weight  for manufacturing.  According  to  their weight for  manufacturing,  all subjects  were  assigned  to 
either the ≤ 50 kg or the > 50 kg group. The infused cell count was calculated by multiplying the appropriate cell 
count with the Actual Percent Volume Infused/100. The total over all bags was calculated by subject and visit.

Prior therapies 
All  33 infused  subjects  received  prior  antineoplastic therapy  with  a median  of 2  (range: 1  to  3)  prior 
lines  of  therapy.  The  most  commonly  used  prior  therapy  (>  50%  of  subjects)  were:  rituximab  (33 
subjects; 100%), cyclophosphamide (32 subjects; 97.0%), vincristine (29 subjects; 87.9%), cytarabine 
or  doxorubicin  (28  subjects;  84.8%),  etoposide  (26  subjects;  78.8%),  methotrexate  (25  subjects; 
75.8%) and ifosfamide (19 subjects; 57.6%). 18.1% (6/33 subjects) received prior autologous HSCT 
transplants. The median time to last HSCT prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 4.3 months (range: 1.4 
to 9.6 months). One subject received prior radiotherapy directed at the abdominal region and the reason 
was  missing.  Nine  subjects  (27.3%)  received  surgery  prior  to  enrolment  in  the  study.  Similar  results 
were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged < 18 years. 
Bridging therapies 
Bridging chemotherapies were administered to 32 of 34 (94.1%) enrolled subjects. The most common 
bridging therapies (≥ 50% of all subjects) were rituximab (22 subjects; 64.7%), carboplatin (18 subjects; 
52.9%),  ifosfamide  (18  subjects;  52.9%)  and  etoposide  (17  subjects;  50.0%).  One  of  34  enrolled 
subjects  received  surgery  and  5  of  34  subjects  received  radiotherapy  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion. 
Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged < 18 years. 
Concomitant therapy 
Concomitant therapy was used by all 33 subjects who received an infusion. The most commonly used 
(>  50%  of  subjects)  concomitant  medications  were  paracetamol  (24  subjects;  72.7%),  bactrim  (21 
subjects; 63.6%), and ondansetron (18 subjects; 54.5%). New antineoplastic medications were used by 
13  subjects  (39.4%)  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion.  The  most  commonly  used  new  antineoplastic 
medications  were  carboplatin,  dexamethasone,  ifosfamide,  methotrexate,  and  rituximab  (4  subjects 
each;  12.1%).  Six  of  33  subjects  received  surgery  and  9  of  33  subjects  received  radiotherapy  after 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. Four subjects (12.1%) received HSCT after receiving tisagenlecleucel infusion 
and after relapse. Two subjects (6.1%) received HSCT with an unknown remission status. Similar results 
were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged < 18 years. 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
Lymphodepleting  chemotherapies  were  administered  to  32  of  34  enrolled  subjects  (94.1%).  The 
lymphodepleting chemotherapies used were fludarabine/cyclophosphamide in combination (32 subjects; 
94.1%) and cytarabine/etoposide in combination (1 subject; 2.9%). 
Assessor’s comment: 
There was no formal dose finding study for the intended population. Therefore, the same dose regimen 
as the previously approved paediatric dose for ALL indication was intended to be administered to the 
NHL population. 97% of subjects received a tisagenlecleucel dose within the target dose range while 3% 
(one  subject)  received  a  dose  above  the  target  dose  range  (Table  15).  The  median  infused 
tisagenlecleucel dose was 1.26x108 (range: 0.30 -2.38x108 cells) CAR-positive viable T cells for subjects 
> 50 kg, and 1.90x106 (range: 0.40-7.30x106 cells/kg) CAR-positive viable T cells per kg for subjects ≤ 
50kg. Slight differences were observed in the doses administered to subjects ≥ 18 years and < 18 years 
of age in both weight categories, with subjects ≥ 18 years of age administered a somewhat higher median 
dose.  
In  the  FAS,  subjects  had  received  a  median  of  2  (range:  1-3)  prior  therapies,  with  18.1%  having 
previously  received  an  autologous  HSCT. 94.1%  (32/34  enrolled  subjects)  received  bridging  therapy, 
while 94.1% (32/34 enrolled subjects) received LD. The high proportion of patients that required bridging 
therapy is likely reflective of rapid progressive disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 32/64 
 
 
 
After tisagenlecleucel infusion, 39.4% of subjects received subsequent antineoplastic therapy, including 
18.1%  (6/33  subjects)  receiving  surgery  and  27.3%  (9/33  subjects)  receiving  radiotherapy.  While 
12.1% (4/33 subjects) received HSCT after tisagenlecleucel infusion and relapse, 6.1% (2/33 subjects) 
received  HSCT  with  unknown  remission  status.  Though  start  of  new  antineoplastic  therapy  was 
considered a censoring event for endpoints DOR, RFS and PFS, this should nonetheless be considered 
when interpreting efficacy results.

PK concentration 
Assessor’s comment: 
Of the enrolled population, 86.8% (33/34 subjects) were treated with tisagenlecleucel and constituted 
the FAS (Table 16). Of these, five patients were excluded to form the efficacy analysis set (EAS, n=28). 
4 subjects were excluded due to a CR to bridging therapy and 1 subject for having the baseline scan 
performed  prior  to  the  end  of  bridging  therapy. In  the  EAS,  24  patients  were  <18  years  of  age.  The 
analysis  sets  are  quite  limited  in  terms  of  number  of  subjects  included,  especially  considering  the 
different histologies represented, although this can be understood in light of the rarity of the condition.

Figure 3. ORR - Forest plot for subgroups (EAS) 
Assessor’s comment: 
At the DCO for this primary analysis (10-Oct-2021), the ORR was 32.1% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 
52.4) in the EAS, with 7.1% (2/28 subjects) achieving CR as BOR and 25.0% (7/28 subjects) achieving 
PR as BOR (The primary efficacy analysis results obtained from study C2202 with DCO date of 10-Oct-
2021 are presented in Table 17 and Table 18. 
Table 18). In subjects < 18 years of age, the ORR was similar.  
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 35/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supportive analyses (Table 19) showed a slightly higher ORR (36.4%, 95%CI: 20.4, 54.9) in the FAS 
(n=33),  which  included  patients  who  had  achieved  a  CR  after  bridging  therapy  and  prior  to  infusion, 
compared to the EAS, mostly due to a trend towards higher CR. This is in line with that has been observed 
in other studies with tisagenlecleucel, and might be due to response to bridging therapy correlating with 
less advanced patients, with better responses to therapy overall. The enrolled set (n=34) had a similar 
ORR to the FAS. 
The ORR observed in study C2202 appears to be numerically lower than that observed for adult patients 
with DLBCL in the pivotal study C2201, where ORR was found to be 54.5% (95%CI: 44.2, 64.6), with a 
CRR of 41.4% and a PRR of 13.1% in the infused set (n=115). Due to inclusion of patients with other 
disease subtypes with poorer prognosis (such as BL) in study C2202, the patient population is not directly 
comparable  to  the  adult  population  in  study  C2201,  which  consisted  of  only  patients  with  DLBCL.  In 
addition, the number of patients included in study C2202 was limited to 28 patients in the EAS, despite 
inclusion of several disease subtypes beyond DLBCL. 
The subgroup analysis showed a substantially lower ORR in subjects with Burkitt lymphoma (20%, 3/15 
subjects), compared to those with histologies other than Burkitt lymphoma (46.1%, 6/13 subjects). In 
the DLBCL subjects (EAS), the ORR was 37.5% (3/8 subjects), with 2 subjects achieving CR as BOR. 
These findings may suggest that the overall ORR observed in study C2202 is negatively influenced by 
the inclusion of patients with Burkitt lymphoma, who are known to have a poorer prognosis. Literature 
data  suggest  that  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  with  Burkitt  lymphoma/leukemia  have  a  poor 
prognosis,  with  an  8-year  OS  of  28%,  compared  with  50%  in  patients  with  DLBCL  (Burkhardt  et  al., 
2021). 
Prior autologous HSCT did not appear to have a large effect on ORR, with subjects with prior autologous 
HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 40% (2/5 subjects), and patients without prior HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 
30.4% (7/23). Failure of,  or ineligibility for HSCT was not necessary for inclusion in the study. There 
were no responders among subjects with prior surgery (n=7 subjects), possibly reflecting a subgroup of 
patients with more advanced disease. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged < 
18 years.  
Considering the single arm nature of study C2202, the limited number of patients included in the trial, 
and  relatively  short  follow-up  duration,  the  results  from  the  primary  analysis,  including  subgroup 
analyses, should be interpreted with caution. Although an ORR of 32% indicates that some paediatric 
patients may have achieved a therapeutical benefit, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the efficacy in 
the mature B-cell NHL population or in the subtypes of disease.  
Secondary Efficacy Results 
Duration of Response 
Nine subjects received a BOR of CR or PR (n=9) (Table 20). The median follow-up in these subjects after 
response was relatively short (2.4 months) and the median DOR was not estimable. 3 subjects (33.3%) 
who achieved a BOR of CR or PR reported relapse or died due to underlying disease prior to the DCO 
(10-Oct-2021).

RFS 
At the time of DCO (10-Oct-2021), 3 subjects (33.3%) who had a BOR of CR or PR died due to any cause 
or had disease progression. The median RFS was not estimable. The estimated relapse-free probability 
was 62.5% (95% CI: 22.9, 86.1) at Month 9.

Figure 10. Kaplan-Meier Plot of OS (EAS) 
As a sensitivity analysis, censoring for HSCT resulted in a similar median OS of 11.4 months (95% CI: 
3.4, NE). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged < 18 years. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Due to the limitations of the study C2202, including the single-arm nature of the trial, the limited number 
of patients and relatively short follow-up duration, there is uncertainty regarding the secondary efficacy 
outcomes, particularly the time-to-event endpoints such as PFS and OS.  
In study C2202, the median DOR was not estimable due to a short follow-up (2.4 months) after response 
in the nine subjects with a BOR of CR or PR (Table 20). In these nine responders, 3 subjects had events 
and 3 subjects were censored due to new antineoplastic therapy or HSCT and 3 subjects were censored 
due  to  ongoing  without  event.  Due  to  the  limited  number  of  responders  and  most  of  these  patients 
censored at the time of analysis, the data on duration of response are immature and difficult to assess. 
Thus, it remains unclear whether there is a clinically meaningful remission in responding patients. 
Of note, in study C2201, median DOR was not reached (10.0, NE) at the latest DCO, while median PFS 
was 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.3, 5.2) and median OS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.6, 23 .9).  
A total of 14 subjects, including 3 subjects with a BOR of PR in the EAS had died at the time of DCO. 
This finding seems to reflect the expected poor prognosis for the enrolled patient population. In the study 
of Burkhardt et al. (2021), 8-year OS was estimated to be 34% in paediatric and young adult patients 
with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL, 28% in those with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and 50% in patients 
with DLBCL.

Exploratory Endpoints 
Antigen (CD19) and other protein expression in baseline tumor biopsies 
CD19  baseline  expression  was  evaluated  in  tumor  biopsy  samples  via  immunohistochemistry  and 
correlated with clinical response parameters. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to measure 
the  expression  levels  of  proteins  Ki67,  CD3,  CD10,  CD20,  PAX5,  BCL2,  and  BCL6.  No  tumor  markers 
investigated clearly correlated with BOR or response outcomes.  
B, T, and NK cell levels 
The  levels  of  B  cells  (CD3-CD19+),  T  cells  (CD3+,  CD3+CD4+,  and  CD3+CD8+),  and  NK  cells 
(CD16+CD56+) were investigated. The longitudinal analysis of the selected immune cell subset levels 
did  not  show  noticeable  differences  at  any  time  points  in  responders  (CR/PR)  as  compared  to  non-
responders (MR/NR/PD). 
Inflammatory markers and cytokines 
Summary of key inflammatory markers and cytokine parameters (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma, 
C-reactive protein, ferritin, etc.) was provided by subject and maximum CRS grade at baseline. Higher 
C-reactive protein levels were found in subjects with grade ½ CRS as compared to subjects with grade 
¾/5  CRS.  However,  very  limited  number  of  subjects  in  the  grade  ¾/5  CRS  group  (n=1)  must  be 
considered when interpreting these results. Overall, non-noticeable differences were observed in any of 
the 3 CRS groups (none, grade ½, grade ¾/5) for all remaining cytokines. 
Apheresis attempts 
One  subject  (2.6%)  experienced  technical  problems  related  to  manufacturing  and  did  not  complete 
screening.  No  other  subjects  discontinued  due  to  technical  issues  prior  to  tisagenlecleucel  infusion. 
Leukapheresis was attempted in all enrolled subjects with a majority of subjects (31 subjects; 91.2%) 
requiring only 1 leukapheresis attempt during the study. 
Health resource utilisation 
The  majority  of  subjects  (25/33  subjects;  75.8%)  were  hospitalized  during  tisagenlecleucel  infusion. 
None of the other 8 subjects required hospitalization at infusion or within 3 days after infusion. The total 
number  of  hospitalizations  was  typically  ≤  1  (25/33  subjects),  with  a  mean  duration  of  each 
hospitalization lasting 13.24 days (range: 2.0-61.0 days) and a mean total hospitalization duration of 
22.2 days (range: 2-85 days). 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-tisagenlecleucel antibodies at baseline were observed in 28 subjects (84.8%) and at anytime post-
baseline  in  32  subjects  (97.0%).  For  1  subject,  the  baseline  anti-mCAR19  antibody  status  was  not 
available.  Pre-existing  immunogenicity  does  not  seem  to  have  any  impact  on  exposure.  Treatment-
induced or boosted anti-mCAR19 antibodies were observed in 10 of 33 subjects in the CKAS, while 21 
subjects  did  not  show  induced  or  boosted  response  and  2  subjects  had  an  unknown  antibody  status. 
Considering high inter-individual variability associated with the parameters and similar Cmax values, no 
apparent relationship was observed between anti-mCAR19 antibody response and expansion of CAR T 
cells.  The  preexisting  antibodies,  i.e.  at  enrolment,  or  maximum  fold  change  from  baseline  to  post-
infusion were not associated with any impact on clinical response. 
Cellular responses to mCART peptides were measured pre-infusion (enrolment) and post-tisagenlecleucel 
infusion by BOR. In general, cellular immunogenicity responses were consistent and remained low (<1%)

for most subjects throughout the study, indicating that cellular immunogenicity does not fluctuate over 
time. 
7.3 Discussion 
In  this  variation  application,  the  primary  analysis  results  of  study  C2202  (BIANCA)  conducted  in 
compliance with paediatric investigation plan (PIP) EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01 were submitted. Study 
C2202 is the only clinical measure of this PIP, which is one of two opened PIPs for Kymriah. Based on 
the submitted data, the MAH proposed to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary 
analysis results from study C2202. The MAH considers that the submitted study results do not support 
a paediatric indication. 
Study C2202 (BIANCA) is a phase II, single arm, multicenter open-label trial to determine the safety 
and  efficacy  of  tisagenlecleucel  in  paediatric  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  mature  B-cell  non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The overall study design of C2202 is in line with the agreed PIP EMEA-001654-
PIP02-17-M01.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  ORR  as  determined  by  local  investigator 
assessment and important secondary endpoints included DOR, PFS and OS. 
The primary efficacy analysis of study C2202, based on all evaluable subjects with mature B-cell r/r NHL 
and measurable disease at baseline, was conducted when those subjects had been infused and followed 
for at least 6 months from study Day 1 or discontinued early, as well as at least 50% of those subjects 
having a follow-up of at least 9 months. The DCO for the analysis was 10-Oct-2021, and the median 
time  between  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  and  DCO  was  16.1  months  (range:  6.1  -29.6).  In  total,  38 
subjects  were  screened  for  the  study,  and  34  subjects were  enrolled.  The  efficacy  analysis  set  (EAS) 
consisted of 24 patients <18 years of age, and 4 patients ≥18 and <25 years of age. The paediatric 
population enrolled in the study had relatively advanced disease, with 87.9% (29/33 subjects) at Stage 
III/IV at baseline, a median of 2 (range: 1 to 3) lines of prior therapy, 18.2% (6/33 subjects) having 
received prior HSCT, a significant proportion of refractory patients (30.3% refractory and 15.2% primary 
refractory), as well as a high proportion of the more aggressive B-cell NHL subtype of Burkitt lymphoma 
(18 subjects; 54.5%). The enrolled patient population is representative of paediatric and young adult 
patients with mature B-cell r/r NHL, who have a highly aggressive disease, indicating a poor prognosis.  
There was no formal dose finding study for the NHL population. Therefore, the same dose regimen as 
the previously approved paediatric dose for the ALL indication was administered in study C2202. Subjects 
weighing > 50 kg received a median of 1.26x108 ((range: 0.30 -2.38x108 cells) CAR-positive viable T 
cells, while subjects weighing ≤ 50 kg received a median of 1.90x106 (range: 0.40-7.30x106 cells/kg) 
CAR-positive viable T cells per kg. This was within the target dose range (0.2-5x106 CAR-positive viable 
T cells/kg for subjects ≤ 50 kg, 0.1-2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells for subjects > 50 kg) for 97.0% 
of subjects, with one subject (3.0%) administered a dose above the target dose range. 
Primary endpoint analysis 
At the time of the DCO, the primary endpoint, ORR, was 32.1% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 52.4), 
with  7.1%  (2/28  subjects)  achieving  CR  as  BOR,  and  25%  (7/28  subjects)  achieving  PR  as  BOR. 
Subgroup  analyses  suggested  a  trend  for  higher  ORR  in  subjects  with  histologies  other  than  Burkitt 
lymphoma (46.1%, 6/13 subjects vs 20%, 3/15 subjects). In the DLBCL subjects in the EAS, the ORR 
was 37.5% (3/8 subjects), with 2 subjects achieving CR as BOR. There was also a trend for higher ORR 
in  subjects  with  serum  LDH  ≤ UNL   (4/8  subjects,  50.0%)  than  >  UNL  (5/19  subjects,  26.3%).  Prior 
autologous HSCT did not appear to have a large effect on ORR, with subjects with prior autologous HSCT 
exhibiting an ORR of 40% (2/5 subjects), and patients without prior HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 30.4% 
(7/23).  
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 47/64 
 
 
 
 
Of note, in the pivotal study C2201 on adult patients with DLBCL, the ORR was 54.5% (95%CI: 44.2, 
64.6), with a CRR of 41.4% and a PRR of 13.1% in the infused set (n=115). However, as the patient 
population  in  this  study  is  substantially  different  from  the  study  C2202  due  to  inclusion  of  different 
disease subtypes, ORR results cannot be directly compared.  
Secondary endpoint analyses 
At the DCO, median DOR in subjects who achieved a BOR of CR/PR was not reached due to short duration 
of follow up (2.4 months). Of the nine responders, 3 subjects had events, 3 subjects were censored due 
to  new  antineoplastic  therapy  or  HSCT,  and  3  subjects  were  censored  due to ongoing  without  event. 
Median EFS was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.8), with an estimated event-free probability of 13.4% (95% 
CI: 3.8, 29.0) at Month 12. Median RFS was not estimable, with an estimated RFS probability of 62.5% 
(95% CI: 22.9, 86.1) at Month 9. Median PFS was 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9), with an estimated 
PFS probability of 22.7% (95% CI: 8.9, 40.3) at Month 12. As of the DCO, median OS was 11.4 months 
(95% CI: 3.4, NE). A total of 14 subjects, including 3 subjects with BOR of PR in the EAS, had died at 
the time of the DCO. The two patients with a BOR of CR were both lost to follow-up, thus it is not known 
whether these patients have died. The observed high mortality is in accordance with the expected poor 
prognosis for the r/r NHL population. In the study of Burkhardt et al. (2021), 8-year OS was estimated 
to be 34% in paediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL, 28% in those with 
Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and 50% in patients with DLBCL. 
Due to the limitations of the study C2202, including the limited number of patients and relatively short 
follow-up  duration  as  well  as  the  single  arm  nature  of  the  trial,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the 
estimates of secondary efficacy outcomes. Further, no estimate of median DOR in responders could be 
derived  from  the  available  data.  In  addition,  39.4%  of  subjects  received  subsequent  anti-neoplastic 
medications  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  adding  further  uncertainty  to  the  estimates  of  secondary 
endpoints, although it was included as a censoring event for DOR, RFS and PFS.  
Overall assessment 
Considering the limitations of the study, including the single-arm nature of the trial, the limited number 
of  patients  and  the  relatively  short  follow-up,  the  primary  analysis  results  of  study  C2202  should  be 
interpreted with caution. Although an ORR of 32.1% indicates that some patients may have achieved 
clinical benefit, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the clinical relevance of the observed efficacy in the 
mature B-cell r/r NHL population or in the histological subtypes. In addition, due to the limited number 
of  responders  and  most  of  these  patients  censored  at  the  time  of  analysis,  the  data  on  duration  of 
response  are  immature  and  difficult  to  assess.  Thus,  it  remains  unclear  whether  there  is  a  clinically 
meaningful remission in responding patients.  
As stated above, subgroup analysis suggests that patients with Burkitt lymphoma had a lower response 
rate, likely contributing to the modest ORR estimate in the current study. Of  note, a trend for higher 
ORR  was  observed  in  patients  with  DLBCL,  as  well  as  in  those  with  histologies  other  than  Burkitt 
lymphoma. These findings seem to be in line with literature data suggesting that paediatric and young 
adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia in general have a poor prognosis, with an 8-year OS of 
28%, compared with 50% in patients with DLBCL (Burkhardt et al., 2021). Despite these trends in ORR 
between subgroups, as well as overall study results indicating that some patients achieved benefit in 
terms  of CR/PR,  the  available  data  are  insufficient to  ascertain  which  subgroups  may  derive  clinically 
meaningful benefit from tisagenlecleucel treatment.  
Although there are several limitations of the study C2202, inclusion of a short description of the study 
and its results in SmPC section 5.1 is supported and is in line with SmPC guidelines for the inclusion of 
information regarding paediatric studies. Considering the high unmet medical need for paediatric patients 
with  r/r  mature  B-cell  NHL,  this  information  may  be  useful  for  the  prescribers.  However,  due  to  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/833142/2022  
Page 48/64 
 
 
 
single-arm  nature  of  the  study,  the  treatment  effect  on time-to-event outcomes  such  as  PFS  and  OS 
cannot be isolated. Moreover, in the current study these estimates were based on very few patients, and 
thus additionally hampered by uncertainty. Therefore, the inclusion of PFS and OS outcomes in the SmPC 
is not endorsed.  
The PI has been updated by the MAH according to the CAT/CHMP comments in the RSI. The proposed 
updates to the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1, and PL section 2 are considered acceptable.   
8. Clinical Safety aspects 
8.1 Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study C2202 (BIANCA) was a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study to determine the safety 
and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult subjects (≤ 25 years) with CD19+relapsed 
or refractory (r/r) mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), who have relapsed after one or more 
prior  therapies  or  have  primary  refractory  disease.  The  study  was  part  of  an  agreed  Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP). 
The evaluation of safety is based on data from 33 subjects infused with tisagenlecleucel.  Study design 
and  treatment  exposure  are  described  in  the  efficacy  section  above  (refer  to  page  19  and  22 
respectively).  Study  treatments  included  bridging  and/or  lymphodepleting  therapy  (if  given)  and 
tisagenlecleucel (investigational drug). 
Safety was monitored closely in the first 1 month following tisagenlecleucel infusion and then every 3 
months  during  the  first  year  of  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  followed  by  semi-annual  assessment 
during the second year and annually thereafter until the end of study. During the annual Follow-up phase 
of  the  study  following  Month  12  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusions,  only  protocol-defined  adverse  events 
(AEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were collected. 
Safety was monitored by physical examination, vital signs, physical development, performance status, 
assessing immunogenicity against tisagenlecleucel, and lab abnormalities, as well as collecting adverse 
events  at  every  visit.  Reporting  of  AEs  was  based  on  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) version 24.1 and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The 
grading of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was based on protocol-specific grading scales. 
Important identified and potential risks associated with tisagenlecleucel infusion are outlined in the EU 
RMP  v  4.1  (dated  12-Jan-2022).  The  list  of  AESIs  and  their  MedDRA  search  criteria  to  identify  AEs 
potentially  reflective  of  AESIs  were  updated  on  a  regular  basis  at  the  program  level  in  the  electronic 
Case Retrieval Strategy form. In addition, post-marketing data from PSUR 6 (reporting period 13-Feb-
2021-12-Aug-2021, data-lock point [DLP] 12-Aug-2021) are provided. 
8.2 Results 
Adverse events 
Regardless of study drug relationship, all subjects (100%) infused with tisagenlecleucel experienced at 
least 1 AE at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most commonly reported system organ class 
(SOC) of any grade at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion (>50%) were immune system disorders 
(75.8%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (63.6%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (63.6%), 
investigations  (63.6%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (60.6%)  and  nervous 
system disorders (57.6%).

and febrile neutropenia (12.1%).  
A  proper  comparative  assessment  of  the  different  age-groups  cannot  be  done  since  there  are  only  4 
subjects aged <18 years. 
AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel were reported in 84.8% of subjects. The most commonly 
reported treatment-related SOC (> 20%) of any grade at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion were 
immune system disorders (72.7%), investigations (39.4%), nervous system disorders (33.3%), general 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (30.3%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  and 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (27.3%  each).  The  most  commonly  reported  Grade  ≥  3  treatment-related 
SOCs  were  investigations  (30.3%)  and  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (24.2%).  Treatment-
related AEs at any time post-tisagenlecleucel administration by PT are presented in Table 26.

Assessor’s comment: 
The  most  commonly  reported  (>20%)  treatment-related  AEs  of  any  grade by PT were  CRS  (69.7%), 
pyrexia (27.3%) and neutrophil count decreased (21.2%).  
Grade ≥ 3 events suspected to be related to treatment at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion were 
reported  in  72.7%  of  subjects.  The  most  commonly  reported  (>5%)  AEs  ≥  Grade  3  were  neutrophil 
count decreased (21.2%), white blood cell count decreased (12.1%), CRS, platelet count decreased, and 
anaemia (9.1% each). 
Overall, the frequencies of treatment-related AEs are in line with what has previously been reported in 
the pivotal clinical B-cell ALL study CCTL019B2202 (n=79).

A proper comparative assessment of the different age-groups cannot be done as there are only 4 subjects 
aged <18 years. 
Time of onset 
AEs  were  reported  primarily  within  8  weeks  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  and  the  incidence  of  AEs 
substantially decreased after this time period. The most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs of 
any grade within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were CRS (66.7%), pyrexia (36.4%), vomiting 
(30.3%),  anaemia  (27.3%),  nausea  (21.2%),  neutropenia  (21.2%),  and  neutrophil  count  decreased 
(21.2%).  The  most  frequently  reported  ≥  grade  3  AEs  within  8  weeks  post-tisagenlecleucel  were 
anaemia, neutropenia (21.2% each), neutrophil count decreased (18.2%), WBC decreased (18.2%) and 
leukopenia (15.2%). The most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs >8 weeks to 1 year post 
first  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  were  pyrexia  (16.7%),  blood  creatinine  increased,  neutrophil  count 
decreased, and headache (10.0% each). 
Deaths

Assessor’s comment: 
Death  at  any  time  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusion  was  reported  in  48.5%  of  subjects  and  the  majority 
(42.4%) died due to study indication. Two subjects (6.1%) died due to AEs; 1 was due to pseudomonas 
infection (D219) and 1 was due to respiratory failure (D134). Neither of these were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study treatment, which seems reasonable. 
Serious Adverse events (SAEs) 
The majority of subjects (75.8%) were hospitalized during tisagenlecleucel infusion. The mean average 
duration of each hospitalization lasted 13.2 days (range: 2.0-61.0 days) and a mean total hospitalization 
duration was 22.2 days (range: 2-85 days).  Regardless of study drug relationship, 69.7% of subjects 
infused with tisagenlecleucel experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. The most commonly reported

SAEs suspected to be related to study drug were experienced by 42.4% of subjects. The most commonly 
reported SAEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel by SOC (> 10%) of any grade at any time 
after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  were  immune  system  disorders  (27.3%),  nervous  system  disorders 
(15.2%),  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (12.1%).  The  most  commonly 
reported SAEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel by PT (> 5%) of any grade were CRS (24.2%), 
pyrexia (12.1%), and seizures (6.1%). These are consistent with the nature of SAEs reported in previous 
tisagenlecleucel studies across indications. 
One (1) subject had a ≥ Grade 3 CRS event. None of the subjects experienced a ≥ Grade 3 event of 
pyrexia or seizure.

Cytokine release syndrome 
Of all the subjects (100%) infused with tisagenlecleucel, CRS was experienced by 69.7% subjects (Table 
30).  The  majority  of  subjects  experienced  grade  ≤   2  CRS.  Four  subjects  (17.4%)  had  concurrent 
infections and four subjects (17.4%) were admitted to the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 30.4% 
of subjects, with the majority (17.4%) receiving only 1 dose. Subjects <18 years had higher incidence 
of  CRS  than  those ≥18  years;  however  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  ≥18  years  old  (n=4),  no 
conclusion could be drawn. When analyzed by disease response (best overall response), CRS appeared 
to be less prominent when subjects had attained a complete or partial response. 
In all cases, the median time to onset of CRS was 8 days (95% CI: 6, 27) after tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
The median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days (95% CI: 3, 8) after onset of CRS. The majority, 95.7% 
of subjects, had CRS resolved with an estimated resolved probability of 60.9% (95% CI: 42.0, 80.1) on 
Day 7 and 100% at Day 14. 
Neurological events 
Of  all  the  subjects  (100%)  infused  with  tisagenlecleucel,  serious  neurological  adverse  reactions  were 
experienced by 27.3% (n=9) of subjects with 15.2% of them experiencing Grade ≥ 3 events (Table 30).  
The median time to onset of first neurological event was 8.0 days (range: 3 to 48 days), with a median 
duration of 9 days (range: 1 to 21 days) for the first neurological event.  The majority of neurological 
events (in 70% of the subject with neurological events) were considered as resolved and the median 
time to resolution of neurological events was 10.5 days (95% CI 1.0, NE). 
Hematopoietic cytopenias 
Hematopoietic  cytopenias  are  commonly  reported  following  CAR  T-cell  infusion,  with  Grade  3  events 
being frequently reported.  
Of the 33 subjects infused with tisagenlecleucel any time, 75.8% of subjects had hematopoietic cytopenia 
AEs, of which 72.7% of the subjects had events that were Grade ≥ 3 (Table 30). Hematopoietic cytopenic 
AEs  (any  grade,  based  on  AE  CRF)  particularly  platelet  count  decreased  (24.2%),  anaemia  (30.3%), 
neutrophil  count  decreased  (27.3%)  and  white  blood  cell  count  decreased  (21.2%)  were  among  the 
most frequently reported AEs in the study. 
At  month  3,  the  resolution  probability  of  cytopenic  AEs  was  42.9%  of  subjects  with  white  blood  cell 
(WBC)  decreased;  71.4%  of  subjects  with  neutrophil  count  decreased  and  100%  of  subjects  with 
anaemia.  
At  month  6,  the  resolution  probability  of  cytopenic  AEs  was  85.7%  of  subjects  with  neutrophils 
decreased;  66.7%  of  subjects  with  lymphocytes  decreased  and  100%  of  subjects  with  anaemia  and 
WBC.  
Infections 
Infections (within 8 weeks post tisagenlecleucel infusion) were reported in 15.2% of subjects, with sepsis 
reported in 2 subjects (6.1%) and other infection events reported in 1 subject (3.0%) each. Grade ≥ 3 
infections were reported in 9.1% of the subjects. 
Infections (at any time since tisagenlecleucel infusion) were reported in 30.3% of subjects, with myelitis 
and sepsis reported in 2 subjects each (6.1% each) and the other infection events reported in 1 subject 
(3.0%) each. Grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 15.2% of subjects (Table 30).

Prolonged depletion of normal B cells or agammaglobulinemia 
Agammaglobulinemia was reported in 15.2% of the subjects, with hypogammaglobulinemia in 3 (9.1%) 
subjects and B-cell aplasia and blood IgG abnormal in 1 subject (3.0%) each. Of these, 1 subject (3.0%) 
had a grade 3 event of hypogammaglobulinemia (Table 30). 
Assessor’s comment: 
Regardless of relationship to tisagenlecleucel, AESI based on important identified risks of tisagenlecleucel 
were experienced by 97.0% of subjects, with 78.8% having experienced a ≥ Grade 3 event. 
The most frequently reported AESIs by group term were haematological disorders including cytopenias 
(75.8%, ≥ Grade 3: 72.7%), CRS (69.7%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), infections (30.3%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), 
serious  neurological  adverse  reactions  (27.3%,  ≥  Grade  3:  15.2%),  prolonged  depletion  of  normal  B 
cells or agammaglobulinemia (15.2%, ≥ Grade 3: 3%).  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) based on important potential risks

most frequently reported PT (any grade) was hypogammaglobulinemia (9.1%, n=3); the other events 
were reported in 2 (6.1%) or 1 (3.0%) subjects. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Local clinical laboratory parameters collected in Study C2202 included haematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis,  coagulation,  pregnancy  screening,  viral  serologies,  and  cerebrospinal  fluid  testing.  Central 
clinical  laboratory  parameters  collected  included  CD19  testing,  tumour  clonal  typing,  tisagenlecleucel 
pharmacokinetics, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, B-cell and T-cell levels, replication competent lentivirus 
(vesicular  stomatitis  virus  glycoprotein),  cytokines,  immunogenicity,  tumor  clonal  typing,  gene 
expression and whole exome analysis and peripheral blood molecular characterization. 
Haematology 
Haematology  parameters  are  presented  in  Table  31.  The  majority  of  subjects  had  their  cytopenias 
resolved by month 3/6 post-tisagenlecleucel infusion.

Liver enzymes 
At  any  time  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  30.3%  experienced  ALT  or  AST  >  3xULN  and  12.1%  of 
subjects experienced total bilirubin > 2xULN. No subjects experienced a fatal hepatic event and in the 
majority of cases, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin elevations resolved. 
Assessor’s comment: 
All  subjects  had  a  post-baseline  haematology  laboratory  abnormality,  and  93.9%  of  subjects  had 
baseline  grade  0  to  2  laboratory  parameters  that  worsened  post-baseline  to  grade  3  to  4.  The  most 
common baseline grade 0 to 2 biochemistry laboratory parameters that worsened postbaseline to grade 
3 to 4 were: decreased potassium (16.1%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (15.6%), increased 
alanine aminotransferase (15.2%), and increased bilirubin (12.1%).

8.3 Discussion 
The safety profile of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult subjects with CD19+ r/r mature B-
cell  NHL,  including  Burkitt  lymphoma,  appears  to  be  consistent  with  other  tisagenlecleucel  studies, 
although it is of note that the sample size is small (n=33). 
AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel were reported in 84.8% of subjects. The most commonly 
reported  (>20%)  AEs  regardless  of  treatment  were,  by  PT,  CRS  (69.7%),  pyrexia  (45.5%),  vomiting 
(36.4%),  anaemia  (30.3%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (27.3%),  headache,  nausea,  platelet  count 
decreased (24.2% each) and neutropenia and white blood cell count decreased (21.2% each). 
Overall, 100% of subjects had Grade ≥ 3 AEs. The most commonly reported Grade ≥ 3 AEs by PT were 
neutrophil  count  decreased  (27.3%),  anaemia  (24.2%),  and  neutropenia  and  white  blood  cell  count 
decreased (21.2% each). 
About half of the subjects (48.5%, n=16) died during the study, most of them (42.4%) due to study 
indication. Two subjects died due to AEs which were considered as unrelated to study treatment by the 
Investigator, which seems plausible. 
Regardless of relationship to tisagenlecleucel, 69.7% of subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the 
study. The most commonly reported SAEs (> 10%) by PT were CRS (24.2%) and pyrexia (18.2%). The 
most commonly reported SAEs (> 5%) suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel by PT were cytokine 
release syndrome (24.2%), pyrexia (12.1%), and seizures (6.1%). 
Regardless  of  relationship  to  study  treatment,  AESIs  based  on  important  identified  risks  of 
tisagenlecleucel  were  experienced  by  97.0%  of  subjects  (≥  Grade  3:  78.8%).  The  most  frequently 
reported AESIs by group term were haematological disorders including cytopenias (75.8%, ≥ Grade 3: 
72.7%), CRS (69.7%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), infections (30.3%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), serious neurological 
adverse  reactions  (27.3%,  ≥  Grade  3:  15.2%),  prolonged  depletion  of  normal  B  cells  or 
agammaglobulinemia  (15.2%,  ≥  Grade  3:  3%).  AESIs  based  on  important  potential  risks  of 
tisagenlecleucel  were  observed  in  33.3%  (12%  experiencing  a  ≥  Grade  3  event)  of  subjects,  with 
hypogammaglobulinemia being the most frequently reported AESI by PT (9.1%, n=3). 
Overall,  the  safety  results  in  this  patient  population  were  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
tisagenlecleucel, although it is of note that the study population is small. No new safety signals were 
observed and therefore no safety-related update to the approved Kymriah SmPC is deemed necessary.

12. MS comments on the CAT Rapporteur’s preliminary 
Assessment Report 
Comments to the CAT Rapporteur’s preliminary Assessment Report dated 30-May-2022 were received 
from Member State (MS) 1 and MS2. 
MS1 comments 
MS1 fully endorsed the CAT Rapporteur’s assessment and had no further comments.   
MS2 comments 
Overall, MS2 agreed with the CAT Rapporteur’s assessment and SmPC comments, and supported the 
inclusion  of  paediatric  data  in  r/r  mature  B-cell  NHL  in  the  SmPC.  MS2  raised  some  specific  issues 
concerning the SmPC, detailed below.  
In section 4.2, MS2 proposed to add the statement “Kymriah is not recommended for use in children 
and adolescents with B-cell lymphomas as efficacy has not been established” to clarify that Kymriah is 
not indicated for paediatric patients with B-cell lymphomas. 
Further,  in  section  4.2,  MS2  proposed  to  adjust  the  age  range  in  the  current  text  “…the  safety  and 
efficacy of Kymriah in children and adolescents below 18 years of age are described in section 5.1….” so 
that it reflects that 4 patients between 20-22 years old were also included in study C2202, and to ensure 
that age ranges given in sections 4.2 and 5.1 match and are consistent.   
In section 5.1, MS2 proposes to add information concerning the number of prior lines of therapy, the 
proportion of patients with prior HSCT, and possibly also the proportion of patients who received bridging 
therapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, on the background that this information would be of interest 
to prescribers.   
Further, MS2 proposes to ask the applicant to specify which subtypes are included in the term “other 
diagnoses”  in  the  phrase  ‘Subgroup  analysis  showed  a  lower  ORR  in  patients  with  Burkitt  lymphoma 
(20%, 95% CI 4.3, 48.1)  compared to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (37.5%, 95% CI: 
8.5, 75.5) or other diagnoses (60.0%, 95% CI: 14.7, 94.7)’.  
The removal of PFS and OS from the SmPC is supported by MS1, considering the data is from a SAT.  
CAT Rapporteur’s Assessment:  
The  comments  received  from  MS1  and  MS2  are  appreciated.  The  comments  from  MS2  have  been 
incorporated as appropriate in the updated SmPC.

EMA/833142/2022

Regarding the MS2 suggestion to include a statement in section 4.2 that the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel 
has not been established in the paediatric B-cell lymphoma population, the CAT Rapp proposed further 
amendments  to  this  section.  In  line  with  the  SmPC  Guideline,  the  following  statement  is  proposed 
included  for  both  DLBCL  and  FL  indications:  “The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Kymriah  in  children  and 
adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet been established”. Please refer to the enclosed SmPC.  
Concerning the proposal to adjust the age range given in the reference in section 4.2, it should be noted 
that the information referred to is given under the subheading of “paediatric population”. Therefore, it 
is not considered appropriate to include information on young adults (18-22 years of age). This approach 
is also in line with the SmPC Guideline. Acknowledging that the data on the young adult population are 
also described under the subheading of “paediatric population” in section 5.1, it is considered acceptable 
to include this information as part of the complete study results.  
It is agreed with MS2 that further baseline information on the EAS, including the number of prior lines 
of therapy, proportion of patients with prior HSCT, as well as the percentage of patients received bridging 
therapy,  may  be  of  value  to  prescribers  and  should  be  included  in  section  5.1.  The  inclusion  of  this 
information would also be consistent with what is presented in the SmPC for the DLBCL and FL pivotal 
studies. A comment regarding the inclusion of this data has been added to the SmPC.  
Concerning the use of the term “other diagnoses” in section 5.1, a small amendment has been proposed 
to clarify. This is considered sufficient as all diagnoses included in the study were already provided in 
the initial paragraph. Please refer to the enclosed SmPC.

The recommended starting dose for patients with a platelet

orally twice daily and the recommended starting dose for 
patients with platelet count between 50,000 to less than

Dose reductions should be considered if the platelet count

ruxolitinib tablets administered orally to patients with 
myelofibrosis (MF) in the previous unstudied 
population of patients who had baseline platelet 
counts between ≥50×109/L and <100×109/L. The

the REPONSE study (B2301) to analyse long term efficacy 
follow-up data from the B2301 Week 256 final 
clinical study report (CSR). The PL was updated 
accordingly. 
The final analyses presented in the CSR are 
submitted to fulfil the Post-Authorisation Measure,

is updated accordingly. The changes have been 
reflected in the RMP version 11 submitted withe the

and safety up to 256 week of treatment with Jakavi. As 
expected, Adverse Events (AEs) frequencies have increased 
with prolonged exposure during the course of the study. 
The changes observed suggest a stable safety profile 
during prolonged treatment and they are reflected in the 
revised product information and RMP.  
Apart from ADR frequencies under long-term ruxolitinib 
treatment, this post-authorisation study specifically 
addressed haematological transformation, non-melanoma

skin-cancer and second malignancies.  Non-melanoma skin 
cancers constitute the most frequently occurring second 
malignancies observed and is listed as an Important 
potential risk in the RMP. 
The SmPC has been updated with the relevant updated 
ADR frequencies in section 4.8. Pneumonia was less 
common for ruxolitinib compared with BAT therapy but was 
still considered an ADR also for MF, similar to PV, and has 
been included in the SmPC 4.8. A tabular presentation of

in effects on growth and bone measures. Reduced bone 
growth was observed at doses ≥5 mg/kg/day when 
treatment started on postnatal day 7 (comparable to 
human newborn) and at ≥15 mg/kg/day when treatment 
started on postnatal days 14 or 21 (comparable to human 
infant, 1–3 years). Fractures and early termination of rats 
were observed at doses ≥30 mg/kg/day when treatment 
was started on postnatal day 7. Based on unbound AUC, 
the exposure at the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect 
level) in juvenile rats treated as early as postnatal day 7 
was 0.3 fold that of adult patients at 25 mg twice daily, 
while reduced bone growth and fractures occurred at 
exposures that were 1.5- and 13-fold that of adult patients 
at 25 mg twice daily, respectively. The effects were 
generally more severe when administration was initiated 
earlier in the postnatal period. Other than bone 
development, the effects of ruxolitinib in juvenile rats were 
similar to those in adult rats. Juvenile rats are more 
sensitive than adult rats to ruxolitinib toxicity.

the death rate in patients randomised to the ruxolitinib arm 
was 44.5% (69 of 155 patients) versus 53.2% (82 of 154) 
in patients randomised to placebo. There was a 31% 
reduction in the risk of death in the ruxolitinib arm as 
compared to placebo (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; 
p=0.025). 
In COMFORT-II, after a median follow-up of 55.9 months, 
the death rate in patients randomised to the ruxolitinib arm 
was 40.4% (59 of 146 patients) versus 47.9% (35 of 73 
patients) in patients randomized to best available therapy 
(BAT). There was a 33% reduction in risk of death in the 
ruxolitinib arm compared to the BAT arm (HR 0.67; 95% CI 
0.44-1.02; p=0.062). 
Long term safety data from two pivotal phase 3 studies 
assessed 457 patients with myelofibrosis who were treated 
with ruxolitinib, including patients initially randomised to 
ruxolitinib (n=301; exposure 0.3–68.1 months, median 
exposure 33.4 months) and patients who received 
ruxolitinib after crossing over from control treatments 
(n=156; exposure: 0.5–59.8 months, median exposure 
25.0 months). The cumulative frequency of adverse events 
in these studies increased proportionally to the increase in 
the follow-up time. With these updated data, therapy 
discontinuation due to adverse events was observed in 
27.4% of patients treated with ruxolitinib.

Study B2301 (RESPONSE). As a result, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. Further, Annex II has been updated to 
include a new post-authorisation measure; provision 
of long-term efficacy and safety data from Study 
B2301. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC. 
Further, an updated RMP version 5.0 was approved 
as part of the application.

In these phase 3 clinical studies sepsis was reported in 
the CHMP following assessment of LEG 011, with the 
ADR ‘sepsis’ and patient-year adjusted rates for 
sepsis from Study 251, Study 351 and Study 352.

with ruxolitinib showed no trends towards an increase in 
the rate of sepsis over time. 
Sepsis was added to section 4.8 as a new ADR with

Another study in healthy subjects indicated that Jakavi 
does not affect the pharmacokinetics of an oral 
contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and 
levonorgestrel. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the 
contraceptive efficacy of this combination will be 
compromised by co-administration of ruxolitinib.

of the company safety databases and literature, another 
potential case of PML has been identified. As a 
consequence, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to 
include a warning on the potential risk of PML. Physicians 
should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML 
that patients may not notice (e.g., cognitive, neurological 
or psychiatric symptoms or signs). Patients should be 
monitored for any of these new or worsening symptoms or 
signs, and if such symptoms/signs occur, referral to a 
neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML 
should be considered. If PML is suspected, further dosing 
must be suspended until PML has been excluded. The PL 
has been updated accordingly.

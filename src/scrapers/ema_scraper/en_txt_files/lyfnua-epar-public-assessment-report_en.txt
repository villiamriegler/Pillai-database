1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. submitted on 2 February 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Lyfnua, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 17 October 2019.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Lyfnua is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content and multiples 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
The application for Lyfnua was submitted along with the application for Gefzuris, subject to compliance 
with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. However, the MAA for Gefzuris was withdrawn by 
the applicant during the assessment. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0380/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Pursuant to Article 11(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA 
Decision(s) P/0380/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance gefapixant contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

1.5.  Scientific advice 
Scientific advice was sought in December 2019 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/85718/2020) on the selection of 
starting material and key reactants for gefapixant citrate drug substance. The applicant has followed 
the recommendations of CHMP and provided the requested additional data. 
Concerning the clinical aspects of this development, scientific advice was received from the CHMP in 
2017, and the final advice letter was issued in July 2017, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432855/2017. The advice 
included a variety of questions related to both pre-clinical and clinical. With regards to the non-clinical 
aspects discussed, questions on the completed and planned toxicity studies were put forward and 
agreed by the CHMP, but at the same time interest was drawn to the formation of crystals in the urine 
and associated histopathology changes in the urinary tract. In that context, the importance of 
conducting the 6-month carcinogenicity study in rasH2 mice was conveyed to the applicant, and it was 
noted that detailed histopathological analysis should be performed to clearly demonstrate (the absence 
of) an association of precipitates and tumour formation. Since then, the applicant has followed advice 
and studied non-clinical carcinogenicity in two species. 
With regard to the clinical aspects of this development, several issues raised by the company were 
acknowledged and agreed upon by the CHMP for the proposed replicate phase 3 trials in chronic cough, 
such as the use of the VitaloJAK™ to measure cough frequency (but not as the sole or single primary 
endpoint), the justification of the doses (with remarks on the definition of the target population), the 
size of the safety database, the proposed pooling of efficacy and safety data, the inclusion of Cough 
Severity Diary (CSD) and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as secondary endpoints. 
Regarding the PRO measurements, it was also advised to include a CSD cut-off of 2.7 (corresponding 
to PGIC ratings of much or very much improved), which was followed by the company.  
Several recommendations were included in the CHMP advice, that were not all followed by the 
applicant. Importantly, it was conveyed that a sole primary endpoint was not considered sufficient to 
document clinical relevance. The inclusion of an adequately validated subjective/functional variable 
ensuring patient relevance (PRO) as co-primary endpoints was advised instead, as well as the 
incorporation of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) as a secondary endpoint. In contrast, 
both phase III studies in this submission do not include a co-primary endpoint, and the PGIC was 
included as an exploratory endpoint only. It was already indicated during the SA that the efficacy 
should be demonstrated convincingly for both endpoints, and improvements seen in these endpoints 
must be statistically significant and clinically relevant (clinically relevant threshold should be 
prespecified).  
Given that the target condition would require long-term or chronic treatment, it has been further noted 
in the SA procedure that maintenance of treatment effect and absence of tolerance needs to be shown. 
To that end, the applicant proposed to expand the duration of one of the trials to 6 months. This was 
noted by the CHMP, but it was also strongly preferred to perform a randomised withdrawal study 
following stable verum treatment, randomising predefined responders to active treatment or placebo. 
The relapse of symptoms according to pre-specified criteria should be the trial endpoint. Also, rebound 
and withdrawal reactions required attention in the form of off-treatment data. 
In conclusion, the main issues that are not in line with the given SA are the absence of a co-primary 
endpoint and a withdrawal study. The applicant also did not proceed with an active comparator study 
as initially discussed. (For completeness of this section, it is also noted that advice recommending 
application to the PDCO for a full paediatric waiver was also given to the applicant in 2019 
(EMEA/H/SA/4046/1/2019/PED/II)).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for this medicinal product is: Gefapixant is indicated in adults for the treatment 
of refractory or unexplained chronic cough.  
Cough is the most common physical complaint for which patients seek medical attention, accounting 
for up to 38% of outpatient pulmonary consultations in the US. In Europe, a survey administered to 
adults with chronic cough indicated that 72% of respondents had seen a doctor at least 3 times for 
their cough, yet only 53% had received a suggested diagnosis for their cough. The estimated 
prevalence of chronic cough ranges from approximately 4% to 11%. Overall, the proportion of patients 
with a chronic cough that is either refractory to the treatment of any underlying condition or 
unexplained ranges from 2.7% to 46%, demonstrating that the epidemiology of RCC and UCC is not 
well understood. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Cough was only recently perceived as a clinical entity besides as a symptom from other respiratory 
diseases (European Respiratory Society Guideline on Chronic Cough). Cough is a protective reflex to 
prevent aspiration into the lung and to enhance airway clearance. It is a multistep process that begins 
with the activation of airway sensory neurons by chemical or mechanical stimuli. The vagus nerve 
contains functionally distinct subsets of sensory neurons such as Aδ- and C-fibres that contribute to 
the initiation of the cough reflex. 
Because of their sensitivity to mechanical and acidic stimuli, Aδ-fibres are believed to protect the lower 
airways against accumulated secretions or aspiration events. C-fibres are activated in response to 
inflammation or the presence of chemical irritants and have thus been proposed as the appropriate 
target for the development of therapies to treat cough presenting as a medical complaint. 
Chronic cough observed in refractory chronic cough (RCC) and unexplained chronic cough (UCC) is 
potentially related to activation of C-fibres via binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors. However, 
the exact role of this P2X3 receptor in cough is still unclear. P2X3 receptors are ATP-gated ion channels 
found on sensory C-fibres in the nodose derived neurons of the vagal nerve in the airways. ATP is 
released from airway mucosal cells under conditions of inflammation, and the binding of extracellular 
ATP to P2X3 receptors is sensed as a damage signal by C-fibres, with subsequent activation. ATP is 
released from airway mucosal cells under conditions of inflammation, and the binding of extracellular 
ATP to P2X3 receptors is sensed as a damage signal by C fibres, with subsequent activation.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
About 5-10% of the adult population has a pathologically excessive and protracted cough. A cough that 
pertains for longer than 8 weeks in adults, it considered chronic cough. Chronic cough has a major 
effect on the quality of life, such with co-morbidities such as incontinence, cough syncope and 
dysphonia. These co-morbidities can, for example, results in social isolation, interference with speech 
and depression. While many different diseases are associated with chronic cough, the clinical 
presentation of the cough is very similar. The patients often complain of high sensitivity to inhalation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 11/153 
 
 
 
environmental irritants such as perfumes, bleaches and cold air. This is suggestive of increased 
sensitivity of the neuronal pathways mediating cough. Some patients cough on a daily basis over many 
years, while in others, the disorder has a relapsing and remitting course. Chronic cough is traditionally 
divided in: 
-  Asthmatic cough/eosinophilic cough 
-  Reflux cough 
- 
- 
Postnasal drip syndrome/upper airways cough syndrome 
Iatrogenic cough (use of ACE-inhibitors) 
Patients with a chronic cough in whom conditions associated with cough cannot be identified despite a 
thorough diagnostic workup are considered to have Unexplained Chronic Cough (UCC). 
2.1.4.  Management 
The assessment and treatment of cough is summarised in the below figure from “the guideline on the 
diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in adults and children” from the European Respiratory 
Society (ERS).  
Figure 1 Cough assessment and treatment in adults 
A proportion of patients have a persistent cough despite thorough investigation and treatment 
according to the published practice guidelines. These patients have a: 
1.  Refractory chronic cough (RCC) if they have a cough-associated condition, but the conventional 
treatments do not work; 
2.  Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) when no diagnosable cause for the cough has been found 
(despite extensive assessment for common and uncommon cases). 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 12/153 
 
 
 
 
Many treatments for chronic cough, such as gabapentin, dextromethorphan, low-dose morphine, and 
codeine are used and are associated with considerable side effects and/or have limited data to support 
their use. However, the inconsistency of results, lack of reliable outcome measures, and low overall 
strength of evidence resulted in the inability to draw firm conclusions on the comparative effectiveness 
of these agents.  
2.2.  About the product 
Gefapixant (MK-7264 is mainly used in this report, but AF-219, RO4926219 are used as well) is a first 
in class, non-narcotic, peripherally active, selective antagonist of the P2X3 receptor. Gefapixant also 
has activity against the P2X2/3 receptor subtype. The applicant for gefapixant requests an indication in 
adult patients with RCC or UCC. The recommended dose of gefapixant is one 45 mg tablet taken orally 
twice daily with or without food. 
2.3.  Quality aspects

The chemical structure of gefapixant was elucidated by a combination of ultraviolet-visible absorption 
spectrophotometry, infrared absorption spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry and elemental analysis. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by single crystal X-ray 
crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. 
The active substance is a white to light yellow non-hygroscopic powder. 
Gefapixant has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
Polymorphism has been observed for gefapixant citrate.  
Gefapixant citrate is a low solubility compound for a human dose of 45 mg. and is pH dependent 
(decrease at pH above 5).  
Permeability of gefapixant was determined to be low with moderate bioavailability. 
Based on the above solubility and the permeability data, gefapixant citrate is considered a BCS class IV 
compound (i.e., low aqueous solubility at neutral pH and low permeability at a human dose of 45 mg).  
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Gefapixant citrate is obtained from a single manufacturer and it is synthesised in four synthetic steps 
using linear synthesis and three purification steps, using a well-defined starting material with 
acceptable specifications.  
A justification for the designated starting material was provided in line with the requirements of ICH 
Q11. The acceptability of the starting material was discussed as part of the Scientific Advice procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/85718/2020). 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for two isolated intermediate products, the starting material and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development 
is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined. The proposed control strategy and batch analysis 
data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. It was confirmed that only one 
process parameter will be deliberately changed from its set-point within its PAR. However, no design 
space or model-based controls are claimed by the applicant. 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), particle size (laser diffraction), glycolic 
acid content (HPLC), and citrate content (titration).  
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA).  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 14/153 
 
 
 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance which were produced in support of development, clinical, 
safety, and stability programs are provided. This includes data on 19 batches, 5 of which are 
commercial scale from the proposed manufacturer. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: identity by IR, description, assay, water, related compounds, 
physical form by XPRD and particle size distribution. The chromatographic methods used for stability 
studies were validated and stability-indicating. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.  
Results on stress conditions on acidic, basic (caustic), free radical, oxidative, thermal and photolytic 
stress conditions were also provided.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable in the proposed container. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a pink, 10.32 mm round and convex immediate release film-coated tablet 
debossed with “777” on one side and plain on the other side. Film coating is non-functional. The 
product is available in 45 mg strength, and it is intended for twice-daily use. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The aim of 
pharmaceutical development was to develop a physically and chemically stable formulation with the 
intended biopharmaceutical properties consistent with the quality target product profile (QTPP). The 
safety, efficacy, and patient compliance requirements were also used to inform the dosage form 
design, primary packaging design, and critical quality attribute (CQA) selection. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment, multi and single factors studies. 
The proposed commercial formulation contains gefapixant citrate and compendial excipients. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. or 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 15/153 
 
 
 
Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012 standards (for iron oxide). There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation.  
A high-throughput excipient screen was conducted on physical mixtures of the active substance with 
commonly used excipients to evaluate their chemical and physical stability under accelerated stress 
conditions. With the results of the excipient compatibility screening study and prior knowledge, 
mannitol and microcrystalline cellulose were selected. In addition, gefapixant citrate is compatible with 
hypromellose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, and magnesium 
stearate. Gefapixant formulation is also compatible with the components of the film coating system as 
demonstrated by the commercial site stability studies. Discussion on functionality related 
characteristics of the excipients was provided during the procedure. 
The comparison of dissolution profiles between clinical Phase III and commercial formulation in media 
across the physiological pH range (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and 6.8) were presented. All batches met the 
proposed specification limit. Additionally, bioequivalence between these two formulations was 
demonstrated by means of in an open-label, two-part, two-period crossover studies (P040). 
The chosen manufacturing process for the final formulation containing gefapixant citrate is a standard 
dry tabletting manufacturing process starting with blending and lubrication, followed by a dry 
compression and film coating. 
The proposed manufacturing process consistently provides a final product meeting CQAs. PARs have 
been defined for the following steps of the medicinal product manufacture: blending, lubrication, 
compression and film coating. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and 
batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. No regulatory 
flexibility for the control strategy such as operational flexibility within multi-variate design spaces or 
the use of process analytical technology for in-process control are proposed or requested. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVdC blisters with push through aluminium lidding foil. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and Commission Regulation (EU) 10/2011. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  seven  main  steps:  blending,  lubrication,  compression,  film 
coating, bulk packaging, primary and secondary packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing  process.  Commercial  process  validation  was  not  carried  out.  The  validation  scheme  / 
process performance qualification has been submitted and this approach is acceptable.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description,  identity  (NIR,  HPLC,  UV),  assay  (NIR,  HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage units (NIR, HPLC) and dissolution (HPLC). 
The  proposed  specification  for  the  finished  product  is  in  line  with  ICH  Q6A  and  is  acceptable  for  this 
type of dosage form. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 16/153 
 
 
 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (in response to the major objection raised in this regard) considering all suspected 
and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, 
no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided on 8 (5 of which are commercial scale) batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging representative to 
the one proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for assay, degradation products, description, dissolution, disintegration, 
hardness, water content, and water activity at each time point. Microbial quality is tested Physical 
stability by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) is tested. 
No significant changes have been observed at any storage condition. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In addition, three commercial scale batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is considered stable 
when exposed to light. 
An open dish stability study was carried out in lieu of a formal in-use study as it represents a worst-
case condition. The open dish study results support that the finished product is stable and therefore 
the product can be considered stable for up to 9 months in open dish at 25ºC / 60% RH and does not 
require any additional precautionary labeling statements. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years, with no special storage conditions, 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The major objection identified on the risk assessment on the 
presence of nitrosamines was resolved in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.4.   Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Gefapixant has been evaluated in a comprehensive nonclinical safety assessment programme that 
included safety pharmacology studies, genotoxicity studies, repeat dose oral tolerability and toxicity 
studies, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies in animal models, 
as well as in vitro phototoxicity to support oral administration in humans. All impurities/degradation 
products were either assessed in toxicology studies or were below the ICH [ICH Q3A(R2); ICH 
Q3B(R2)] qualification thresholds and have been assessed for mutagenic potential according to ICH M7 
guidance. 
Overall, the nonclinical development programme was conducted in accordance with International 
Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) guidance. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Gefapixant binds to P2X3 homotrimers and P2X2/3 heterotrimer channels. Binding to rat P2X3 and 
human recombinant P2X3 and P2X2/3 was measured in CHOK1 and 1321N1 cell lines as inhibition of 
intracellular calcium flux. The IC50 values for rat P2X3 and human P2X2/3 ranged from 66 nM to 214 
nM. Gefapixant hydrochloride showed the highest binding affinity for human P2X3 with an IC value of 
28 nM. Gefapixant did not bind to other P2X channels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 18/153 
 
 
 
In rat dorsal route ganglions (P2X3) and rat nodose ganglion neurons (P2X2/3) antagonism of α,β-
MeATP-induced currents were shown after exposure to gefapixant, with pKi values of 8.3 and 6.9 
respectively. Similarly, antagonism of induced currents in HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant 
human P2X3 and P2X2/3 channels was shown, with KD values of 140 and 250 nM, respectively. It can 
be concluded that gefapixant binds to P2X3 and P2X2/3 channels with high affinity and specificity. 
P2X3-containing receptors are ATP-gated ion channels and are primarily expressed on the C and Aδ-
sensory fibres. These fibres are also present in upper and lower airways and apparently are involved in 
airway sensitisation and cough.  
A number of animal studies has been performed, using different models for a wide variety of diseases. 
These include different rat models of pain: Formalin-induced nocifensive behaviour, mechanical 
hyperalgesia, iodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis, chronic constriction injury and models of neuropathic 
pain. In these models, a reduction of pain-induced behaviour was observed after single or repeated 
doses of gefapixant. Effects on bladder contraction reflex were studied in rat models of micturition. 
Different dosing regimens and administration routes were evaluated, which resulted in variable 
outcomes, where not all endpoints were affected consistently. Overall, some effect on inhibition of 
bladder contraction could be seen. Several other studies were conducted in rat models of abdominal 
constriction, paw oedema, colon hypersensitivity and hypertension. In these models, effects of 
gefapixant treatment were seen on abdominal contraction (decreased) and hypertension (reduced 
blood pressure, heart rate), whereas no effects were observed on paw oedema and colon 
hypersensitivity.  
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In a secondary pharmacology in vitro screen of 73 receptors, ion channels and enzymes, no significant 
binding was observed for gefapixant when tested up to 10 µM. A further screen of 121 kinases also 
revealed no significant binding. It can be concluded that gefapixant has no off-target binding potential 
and is specific for the P2X channels. 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Gefapixant was negative in the hERG channel assay at concentrations up to 100 µM, which is 147-fold 
above the clinical Cmax. When tested in vivo in dogs, there were no effects on the ECG recordings. At all 
dose levels, there was a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. This effect is likely due to the 
pharmacological action of gefapixant since decreases in blood pressure, and heart rate were also seen 
in the Spontaneous Hypertension Rat (SHR) model as described in the primary pharmacodynamics 
section. In conclusion, no adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have been observed at doses 
resulting up to a Cmax 59-fold above the clinical Cmax. The respiratory system was evaluated in rats. The 
only effect observed was a decrease in tidal volume at the high dose of 1680 mg/kg. The safety factor 
at the NOAEL is 16, based on Cmax. There were no effects on the central nervous system in rats when 
tested up to 2000 mg/kg, leading to 10-fold and 19-fold the human AUC and Cmax, respectively. 
Evaluation of urinary electrolyte excretion in rats showed a transient increase in total urinary excretion 
of sodium and/or chloride and a transient decrease in potassium excretion at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. 
Gefapixant caused a dose-dependent delay in gastric emptying at ≥500 mg/kg and decreased 
intestinal motility at 2000 mg/kg. 
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed.

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The applicant provided validation reports for the analytical methods used, demonstrating the suitability 
of the methods, storage, and handling for the purpose of analysis of gefapixant. Specific and sensitive 
bioanalytical assays were developed and validated for the quantitative determination of gefapixant in 
mouse, rat, dog, and rabbit plasma, as well as in rat milk. The methods for quantification of gefapixant 
utilised an automated 96-well format protein precipitation of drug from plasma, followed by liquid 
chromatography (together with internal standard) using reversed-phase chromatography and 
subsequent MS/MS detection employing an electrospray interface in the positive ion mode. Metabolites 
were characterised by high-resolution mass spectrometry with radioactivity detection, and their 
proposed identity was based on exact mass and MS/MS fragmentation patterns. 
Absorption 
The absorption of a single 2 mg/kg oral or IV dose of gefapixant in fasted female WH rats showed a  
bi-phasic decline after dosing, with a moderate distribution volume Vd,ss (4.22 L/kg), clearance CLp 
(29.5 mg/min/kg) and terminal elimination half-life t1/2 (4.4 h). Upon oral dosing, Tmax was fast with 
1.5 hours, whereas bioavailability was low (38.3%), although the oral dosing study was limited in the 
amount of data points, which might influence this value.  
Subsequent studies with increasing oral doses of gefapixant in the formulation selected for GLP toxicity 
studies (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose containing 0.4% polysorbate 80 in water) showed dose-
proportional increases in gefapixant exposure from 100 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg, and a less than dose-
proportional increase in exposure from 500 mg/kg to 6000 mg/kg (administered as 3000 mg/kg BID).  
In dogs, single-dose studies with 0.5 mg/kg of an oral or IV dose of gefapixant in fasted female Beagle 
dogs showed a bi-phasic decline. The PK of gefapixant in dogs was characterised by a low CLp  
(2.4 mL/min/kg), a low Vd,ss (0.64 L/kg), and a moderate terminal t1/2 (~4 hours). The oral 
bioavailability of gefapixant was 81.5%. Subsequent studies where the formulation of gefapixant was 
prepared in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose containing citric acid (selected for GLP toxicity 
studies) provided sufficient exposures for toxicology studies despite exhibiting less than dose-
proportional increases from BID dosing of 25 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg.  
The potential effect of gastric pH on the pharmacokinetics of gefapixant was evaluated in dogs. Studies 
were conducted in dogs pre-treated with either pentagastrin (resulting in lower gastric pH) or 
famotidine (pH neutralisation). Following administration of gefapixant prepared in a non-acidified 
formulation as a solution, a 4-fold increase in gefapixant exposure was observed in pentagastrin-
treated dogs, but no increase was observed in famotidine-treated dogs, indicating that a low gastric pH 
resulted in increases in exposure to gefapixant. Indeed, when gefapixant was administered as a 
tartaric acid-containing tablet, no difference in gefapixant exposure was observed in pentagastrin-
treated dogs or famotidine-treated dogs.  
Concerning multiple-dose studies, in rat and dog, no evidence for accumulation was observed, whereas 
mouse repeated-dose studies showed evidence indicating potential accumulation of gefapixant.  
Distribution 
The in vivo tissue distribution of [14C]gefapixant was investigated in the rat from 2 up to 168 hours 
(male, albino Wistar Hannover) or 2 up to 672 (male, pigmented Long-Evans) hours post-dosing and 
assessed quantitatively by measuring radioactivity in autoradioluminograms. In Long-Evans rats, upon 
oral administration of 20 mg/kg, tissue to plasma ratios (T/P) were similar to or greater than 1 for 
most tissues, except central nervous tissue, bone, lens and abdominal fat at 2, 6 and 10 hr post-dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 20/153 
 
 
 
The highest observed T/P ratios were observed in the large intestine wall, cecum mucosa and non-
glandular stomach wall at 2 and 6 hours as a result of oral dosing. The majority of tissues were below 
LLOQ (0.0675 µg equiv/g) by 36 h post-dose, indicating rapid elimination, and at 672 h post-dose, all 
tissues were below BQL. Pigmented and non-pigmented skin showed similar T/P ratios, which were 
both below LLOQ after 36 hours. In Wistar Hannover rats, upon oral administration of 20 mg/kg, tissue 
to plasma ratios showed significant distribution to the endocrine and metabolic/excretory tissues, as 
well as the gastrointestinal tract. The highest T/P ratios were observed in the small intestinal wall and 
liver, with other tissues showing T/P ratios similar to or greater than in plasma, except central nervous 
tissue, bone, eye, lens, and abdominal fat at 2 hours. The majority of tissues were below LLOQ by 168 
post-dose.  
Since the T/P ratio for the uveal tract of the eyes increased threefold in LE compared to WH rats, 
gefapixant appeared to be associated with melanin binding. However, this association appeared to be 
reversible, based on the observation that the T/P ratio returned to below LLOQ levels by 672 hours 
post-dose in LE rats. Also, pigmented skin showed similar T/P ratios compared to non-pigmented skin, 
with no radiolabel being detected for both skin samples after 36 hours. 
The distribution of gefapixant to the central nervous system was evaluated in rats following a single 
P.O. dose of 90 mg/kg, a subcutaneous (SC) dose of 30 mg/kg, or an IV infusion of 62.3 mg/kg over 
an 8-h period. In all these studies, the brain-to-plasma concentration ratios were approximately 0.05, 
suggesting that gefapixant distribution in the brain was limited to blood volume in the brain. In 
pregnant rats, the placental transfer of gefapixant was investigated following 100 or 225 mg/kg TID 
oral dosing of gefapixant from gestation day 6 through 18. Plasma concentrations of gefapixant were 
determined in maternal and foetal plasma samples collected 0.5 and 1-hour post-dose on gestation 
day 18. The ratios of foetal to maternal plasma concentration of gefapixant were approximately 0.15 to 
0.21, indicating the placental passage of gefapixant in rats. In pregnant rabbits, the placental transfer 
of gefapixant was investigated following 400 or 1500 mg/kg oral dosing of gefapixant from gestation 
day 7 through 20. Plasma concentrations of gefapixant were determined in maternal and foetal plasma 
samples collected 1 and 2-hour post-dose on gestation day 20. Gefapixant crossed rabbit placenta, 
with mean gefapixant foetal/maternal plasma concentration ratios that ranged from approximately 
0.18 to 0.25 at 1- and 2-hours post-dose. 
Using equilibrium dialysis, the plasma protein binding of gefapixant was investigated for mice, rats, 
rabbits, dogs and humans. The fraction unbound (Fu) ranged from 33.9 to 51.9 % for these species, 
with Fu for human plasma at 45.3%. No concentration-dependent plasma protein binding was observed 
for the concentrations tested (0.1, 1 and 10 µM for human plasma and 1, 10 and 50 µM for animal 
plasma). The Fu of gefapixant did not appear to be concentration-dependent at a clinically relevant 
steady state concentration, which is covered within the tested range. Gefapixant bound mostly to 
human serum albumin, with 25% of gefapixant being detected as an unbound fraction.  
The blood/plasma partitioning of gefapixant was determined in vitro with fresh whole blood and plasma 
from nonclinical species and humans. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 1.26 (rat), 0.83 
(dog), and 1.11 (human) at 0.3 µM gefapixant, indicating gefapixant partitioning into red blood cells in 
rat and human blood. No concentration-dependence in the blood to plasma concentration ratio was 
observed in human blood at the concentration range tested (0.1 – 5.0 µM). 
Female rats were administered gefapixant by orally, beginning on Day 6 of gestation (GD 6) continuing 
through Day 10 of lactation (LD 10). Concentrations of gefapixant were determined in maternal plasma 
and milk samples collected at 0.5 and 1 h post-dose on lactation day 10. Following the 300 mg/kg and 
675 mg/kg daily doses, concentrations of gefapixant in milk at 1 h post-dose were 3.6- and 4.0-fold 
higher than maternal plasma concentrations, respectively, indicating the distribution of gefapixant into 
milk of lactating rats.

Metabolism 
Gefapixant was mainly eliminated via urinary excretion of the unchanged compound, with metabolism 
observed as a minor elimination pathway in rat, dog and human. The primary biotransformation 
pathways observed in the ADME studies included hydroxylation, O-demethylation, dehydrogenation, 
oxidation and direct glucuronidation. Secondary biotransformation pathways included glucuronidation 
of O-demethylated metabolite as well as the formation of a metabolite that was  
O-demethylated and dehydrogenated.  
The in vivo biotransformation of gefapixant was assessed following single dosing of [14C]gefapixant at 
20 mg/kg orally in intact and bile-duct cannulated (BDC) rats, intravenous dosing at 2 mg/kg in BDC 
rats, and oral dosing at 1 mg/kg in BDC dogs and at 50 mg in humans. No multiple dosing studies 
were reported. In plasma, unchanged gefapixant was the most abundant drug-related component in all 
three species (87% in humans, 100% in dogs and 100% in rats of the total 14Cdrug-related AUC in 
plasma). Circulating metabolites in human plasma included three low to moderately abundant 
molecules:  
M1 (glucuronide of O-demethylated gefapixant), M5 (directly glucuronidated parent) and  
M13 (hydroxylated). These accounted for respectively 1.0%, 6.3% and 5.8% in human, whereas in 
both rat and dog the metabolites M1 and M5 were not detected, while M13 was detected only by mass 
spectrometry. In addition, in humans, the metabolites M8 (dehydrogenated) and M11 (oxidated) were 
only detected by mass spectrometry and thus not quantified. These two metabolites were detected in 
dog also only by mass spectrometry and were not detected at all in rat. Taken together, the five 
metabolites observed in human plasma accounted for ~13% of the total 14Cdrug-related AUC in 
plasma in humans, versus ~87% for unchanged gefapixant. The most abundant metabolite in human 
plasma was M5, which was detected at 6% of the total drug label-related AUC in plasma; therefore, 
none of the human metabolites constitutes a major metabolite, and no further nonclinical 
characterisation was required. Apart from human plasma, urine and faeces, M5 was detected only in 
rat bile and not in dog at all. However, M5 was a direct glucuronide of gefapixant and therefore was 
not considered to require further investigation. M13 represented 6% of the 14C drug-related AUC. This 
metabolite was considered not to require additional investigation since it was detected by mass 
spectrometry in both rat and dog in plasma, urine and faeces. The results from the other species 
indicated that in rat, M1 and M5 were identified only in bile, suggesting other routes of elimination for 
rat metabolism for these metabolites, whereas M1 and M5 were not detected in dog plasma, bile or 
faeces at all, indicating that this pathway was absent in dog. In the rat, the pathways involved in 
metabolism included oxidation, hydroxylation, O-demethylation and a combination of O-demethylation 
and dehydrogenation; in the dog hydroxylation, oxidation and dehydrogenation were observed, 
whereas in human, oxidation, hydroxylation and both direct and secondary glucuronidation were 
observed.  
In excreta, following an IV dose of [14C]gefapixant to BDC rats, the majority of the dose (~68% of 
dose) was recovered from urine. Almost all radioactivity in urine was recovered as unchanged 
gefapixant (~65% of dose). The remainder of the dose was recovered in bile (10% of the dose) and 
faeces (17% of the dose). In both bile and faeces, unchanged gefapixant was responsible for the 
majority of the recovered radioactivity, indicating significant intestinal excretion of unchanged 
gefapixant in rats. Together, these results show that excretion of intact gefapixant was the main route 
of gefapixant elimination, with only a minor role for metabolism. Metabolites M9 and M11 (with 
oxidation at the diaminopyrimidine moiety), as well as M6 and its glucuronides (M2 and M3), were 
observed as minor metabolites in excreta, totalling less than 10% of the dose. 
After P.O. administration of [14C]gefapixant to BDC rats, the recovered dose in faeces, urine, and bile 
was 63%, 31%, and 6%, respectively. The predominant radioactive component in excreta was 
gefapixant, accounting for 62% of the dose in faeces, 29% in urine, and 3% in bile. Metabolite M1

(a glucuronide of M6) as well as metabolites M2, M3, M6, M9, and M11 collectively accounted for less 
than 6% of the dose. Several minor oxidative metabolites and glucuronide conjugates (M4, M5, M7, 
M8, M10, and M13) were detected by mass-spectrometry only. Following P.O. administration of 
[14C]gefapixant to BDC dogs, the recovered dose in faeces, urine and bile was 16%, 72% and 6%, 
respectively. Again, unchanged gefapixant constituted the majority of the radioactivity in these 
excreta, accounting for 16%, 66% and 6% of the dose. An oxidative metabolite M11 was detected in 
urine (6% of the dose), and minor metabolites M4, M6, M7, and M13 were detected in excreta by 
HRMS only. 
In humans, a similar pattern of excretion was observed: after P.O. administration of [14C]gefapixant, 
76% and 23% of the dose was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. Gefapixant was the major 
drug-related component in all excreta, accounting for 64% and 20% of the dose in urine and faeces, 
respectively. Similar to rats and dogs, in humans, excretion of unchanged gefapixant via urine 
appeared to be the main elimination pathway, with a minor role for metabolism (14% of the dose was 
recovered as metabolites in all excreta, mainly as secondary metabolites). The metabolites detected in 
urine included oxidative products and glucuronide conjugates (M1, M5, M8, M11, and M13). 
Metabolites detected in faeces were M5, M6, M11, and M13. All the metabolites detected in human 
excreta and plasma were observed in either rat and/or dog (although some only by high-resolution 
mass spectrometry) and were <10% of drug-related plasma exposure based on the radiometric peak 
area. 
Gefapixant incubated with rat, dog, monkey, and human microsomes at 1 µM revealed very slow 
metabolism in these microsomes for all species tested.  
In hepatocytes of the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human, 10 µM of [14C]gefapixant showed low 
metabolism in all species, and its metabolic profile was qualitatively similar across all species. Multiple 
mono-oxidations, O-demethylation, and glucuronic acid conjugations of parent and metabolites were 
the major routes of metabolism identified. All metabolites observed in human liver preparations were 
also detected in nonclinical species.  
Excretion 
In rat, dog and human, the excretion of [14C]gefapixant-associated radioactivity was predominantly 
through the renal (urinary) pathway as unchanged gefapixant.  
In rats dosed intravenously with 2 mg/kg [14C]gefapixant, the urinary pathway accounted for 40% to 
~68% of the radioactivity recovered, with the faecal (biliary) pathway contributing ~20 to 27%. In the 
study showing ~68% of renal elimination, metabolite profiling analysis of excreta showed that 
unchanged gefapixant was the major component in all excreta and that excretion of intact parent in 
urine (~65% of dose), faeces (~16%), and bile (~5%) were the major routes of gefapixant 
elimination. The presence of unchanged gefapixant in faeces indicated intestinal secretion of the parent 
compound. Rats dosed orally with 20 mg/kg [14C]gefapixant showed that ~37% of the radioactivity 
was excreted via the urinary pathway, with ~63% of radioactivity being recovered in faeces. The 
intestinal secretion observed in the IV dosing study suggested that the fraction of absorption could be 
much higher than 36%. Experimental recoveries were 79% for the first IV study, with 97 and 100 % 
recoveries for the other two studies. Similar to rats, dogs dosed intravenously with 2 mg/kg 
[14C]gefapixant showed that the majority of radioactivity (~52%) was recovered from urine. Moreover, 
dogs dosed orally with 1 mg/kg [14C]gefapixant showed the majority of radioactivity was recovered in 
urine (~72%). Metabolite profiling analysis of excreta showed that the unchanged parent compound 
was the predominant radioactive component in bile (~6% of the dose), urine (~66% of the dose), and 
faeces (~16% of the dose). For this study, the experimental recovery was found to be 99%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 23/153 
 
 
 
Humans dosed with 50 mg of [14C]gefapixant via an oral dose showed renal excretion as well, with 
~76% of the radioactivity recovered in urine and ~23% recovered in faeces. In urine and faeces, 
unchanged gefapixant accounted for 64 and 20% of the dose, respectively, indicating a minor role in 
metabolite excretion. The experimental recovery was 99% for this study.  
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
In order to identify the urinary concentrations of gefapixant associated with crystal formation in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, rats were dosed SC with 200 mg/kg gefapixant, and the urinary 
gefapixant concentrations were measured in ureter catheterised rats. Following a single SC 
administration of 200 mg/kg gefapixant, the maximum urine concentration was 2.27 mg/mL. At this 
concentration of gefapixant, numerous crystals were observed in urine collected directly from the 
ureters. In another study conducted following a single SC administration of 200 mg/kg of gefapixant, 
the maximum urine concentration was 0.41 mg/mL. A single urine crystal was observed in one of the 
four rats. Finally, following a single oral administration of gefapixant at 500 mg/kg, no crystals were 
detected in urine isolated from the ureter despite the concentration achieved in the urine of 1.50 
mg/mL. 
Given the detection of crystals composed of gefapixant in the urine from the rat and dog toxicity 
studies, the solubility of gefapixant was evaluated in urine obtained from rat, dog, and human. 
Gefapixant solubility was strongly pH-dependent in human urine. The steady-state urine solubility, at 
pH 5 to pH 7, the normal pH range in human urine, ranged from ~0.03 to ~0.11 mg/mL, but solubility 
was much higher at acidic pH values (>10 mg/mL). 
2.4.4.   Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Oral single dose treatment was well-tolerated in mouse (up to 2000 mg/kg) and rat (up to 500 
mg/kg). No animals died in these studies. In rat, at 2000 mg/kg one female had a calculus within a 
thickened urinary bladder concurrent with histopathological signs of hyperplasia, inflammation, crystal-
forming and superficial necrosis of transitional epithelium and necrosis of smooth muscle of the urinary 
bladder. The NOAEL was 2000 and 500 mg/kg for the mouse and rat, respectively. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Rat 
Gefapixant was tested in rats in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months of duration with a 
maximum recovery period of two months. In the non-pivotal and one-month study, dosing was 
performed once each day. However, twice per day dosing was used for a subsequent one-month study 
and increased to three times per day dosing for the 3 months and half-year study in the rat. The main 
target organs of toxicity in rats were the kidney, ureter, and urinary bladder. Urinary crystals were 
formed in a dose-dependent manner and often observed at all doses tested. Crystalluria was 
associated with adverse effects observed in these organs. Adverse effects observed across studies 
included increased kidney weight, increases in BUN and serum creatinine levels, histopathological 
findings in kidney, ureter, and urinary bladder, including distended tubules, degeneration of epithelial 
cells lining tubules, papillary necrosis and inflammation in the interstitium in the kidney, dilatation and 
inflammation of the ureter and transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder. Inflammation was 
associated with increased higher mean total leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts. In addition, 
in several repeat-dose toxicity studies, mandibular salivary gland weight was increased, associated

Page 24/153 
 
 
 
with vacuolation of the salivary gland at the highest doses tested. This effect was not accompanied by 
any related clinical signs and fully reversible after 1- and 2-months recovery. A clear aetiology of the 
vacuolation in the salivary gland was not established. At the highest dose levels tested (>20-fold 
exposure at MRHD), some animals were sacrificed under moribund conditions, including observed 
clinical signs (hypoactivity, paleness, ataxia, irregular respiration, piloerection, hunched posture, 
and/or squinting prior to death). After the recovery phase, all observed effects were reversed or were 
almost resolved (kidney at highest doses tested). Crystal formation was more severe in female rats 
than at the same dose in males, possibly due to higher plasma exposures compared to male rats. The 
exposure margin at the NOAEL in the three- and six-month rat repeat dose toxicity studies was ≥3.5-
fold exposure at MRHD. 
Dog 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in Beagle dog were performed up to nine months with 2 months of 
recovery. In the pivotal studies, dosing was performed twice each day. Only minimal toxicity was 
observed in the dog at exposure margins of >35-fold exposure at MRHD. The effects observed included 
crystalluria, which was more pronounced in females. Additional adverse effects observed were related 
to obstruction by crystalluria, including unilateral calculus in kidney, ureter and/or urinary bladder, 
inflammation in the kidney and urinary bladder and hyperplasia in the urinary bladder (at exposures 
approximately 50-fold exposure at MRHD). The exposure margin at the NOAEL in beagle dogs was 
approximately 20-fold the exposure at MRHD. 
Mouse 
Gefapixant was in general well tolerated in mice after exposure up to three months with an exposure 
margin of up to 10-fold exposure at MRHD of 45 mg/day. Urinary crystals were observed in both males 
and females in the 3-month study. In a one-month study, three animals showed macroscopic and 
microscopic findings in the kidney, ureter, and urinary bladder, including one female with a moribund 
condition showing clinical signs and papillary necrosis in both kidneys, was associated with the 
moribund condition. These findings were not reproduced in the three-month study. 
Crystalluria: Based on several investigative studies, it was shown that precipitation of crystals in the 
kidney, ureter and urinary bladder across species is possibly due to minimal solubility of gefapixant at 
physiological urine pH, primary excretion of gefapixant in the kidney and the fact that the chemical 
structure contains a sulphonamide moiety. Sulphonamide containing drugs is known to cause 
crystalluria and occasional calculi due to their poor solubility and high urinary excretion, favouring 
crystallisation in the urine. Higher incidences of crystals and crystal related nephropathy in female rats 
at high doses was driven by slightly higher systemic exposure (AUC) and Cmax values likely leading to 
higher urinary concentration and crystal formation in female rats. Regarding dog, crystal related 
nephropathy was observed in a limited number of animals, and the incidence was comparable between 
males and females in the one week and 3-month toxicity studies. In addition, although in the 9-month 
study a higher incidence of urinary crystals was observed in females, no associated increase related in 
histopathological findings were observed in females. It was concluded that data from gefapixant 
studies in both rats and dogs show no evidence of sex difference in sensitivity to crystalluria and 
related nephropathy. 
Due to the lower exposure and lower excretion in the clinical setting compared to values in the repeat 
dose toxicity animal studies, the applicant expects that the finding of crystalluria is of limited clinical 
relevance. In general, in the repeat-dose toxicity studies across species effects consisted mainly of 
crystalluria induced adverse outcome on the kidney, ureter and urinary bladder. Also, female animals 
seemed to be more sensitive than male animals.

2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Gefapixant was found to be negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, the human peripheral 
blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in rats 
bone marrow. In the human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, at the highest 
tested concentration of 1000 µg/mL with metabolic activation (3h treatment, 21h recovery) a slight 
significant difference in %S-cells was observed compared to the vehicle control. However, the 
incidence of the control was very low within historical control values (0.0%), and the incidence of the 
1000 µg/mL sample (3.0%) was within historical control (0.0%-5.0%). Therefore, it is agreed that the 
result form this test can be considered negative. Overall, it can be concluded that gefapixant did not 
show any genotoxic potential in the pivotal genotoxicity assays. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity was assessed in rasH2 transgenic mice in a half-year chronic exposure study. There 
was no increase in carcinogenic potential by gefapixant compared to the negative controls, up to a 
dose of 500 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, as in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, no further 
gefapixant related findings were observed. Only Cmax was measured in this study before necropsy (high 
dose 2200 ng/mL), which was in a similar order of magnitude as can be expected from the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies with these rasH2 transgenic mice.  
A second carcinogenicity study was performed in Wistar Han rats, in which animals were treated for 
two years with gefapixant up to 300 mg/kg/day. A trend for an increased incidence of adenoma of the 
pars distalis of the pituitary gland was observed in males at all dose levels compared to control. 
However, this finding was within the historical control range. Furthermore, incidences of this adenoma 
were higher in females compared to males for all treatment groups, including vehicle and water 
control. It is agreed that this finding is not considered to be test article related.  
Other non-neoplastic findings were similar to the findings observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in rats and were related to the presence of crystals in the urinary tract at high dose. Effects included 
findings related to local irritation, inflammation and hyperplasia. The NOAEL in the two-year rat 
carcinogenicity study had an exposure margin based on AUC0-24h of approximately 8-fold exposure at 
MRHD. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No effects on male or female fertility or early embryonic development were observed in rats up to an 
exposure margin of 11-fold for females and 13-fold for males, compared to exposure at MRHD. In the 
embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study in rats, foetal body weight was slightly decreased (up to 
7%) in the presence of maternal toxicity, including decreased body weight gain and food consumption. 
At the developmental NOAEL, the exposure margin was 6-fold exposure at MRHD. The rabbit embryo-
foetal developmental toxicity study did not show any adverse effect related to gefapixant up to an 
exposure margin of 35 fold MRHD. Maternal toxicity, including 1 female abortion at the highest dose 
tested and body weight (gain) loss and decreased food consumption, were observed dose-dependently 
at high and mid-dose. The exposure margin for developmental toxicity was approximately 35-fold 
exposure at MRHD. 
In the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study in rats, dose dependent maternal toxicity was 
observed, including effects on body weight, food consumption, clinical signs, gefapixant associated 
effects on the kidney, ureter, and urinary tract. At the highest dose tested, two litters had complete 
litter loss, due to severe maternal toxicity resulting in poor maternal care to the pups. No effects on

development, sexual maturation, behavioural endpoints, or other parameters were observed in the F1 
group. The maternal exposure at the NOAEL for pre and postnatal development was approximately 11-
fold exposure at MRHD. 
2.4.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
In general, for mouse, rat, and dog, increases in gefapixant dose resulted in less than dose-
proportional increases in AUC and Cmax values. In rat and dog, no evidence for accumulation was 
observed, whereas mouse repeated-dose studies showed evidence for accumulation. In mouse, the 
exposure multiples ranged from 2.7-9.9 for AUC values and from 4.4-48 for Cmax values. In rat, 
exposure multiples based on AUC values ranged from 2.4-17, and exposure multiples based on Cmax 
values ranged from 5.6-22. In the dog, exposure multiples based on AUC values ranged from 19-24, 
and exposure multiples based on Cmax values ranged from 17-27. It can therefore be concluded that 
adequate exposure was maintained to evaluate safety in the toxicologic studies. 
2.4.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Gefapixant was classified as non-irritant in the bovine corneal opacity and permeability test (BOCP) 
and the EpiDerm MTT viability assay. 
2.4.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Based on the negative outcome of primary and secondary pharmacology related to targets of liability 
potential, negative CNS safety pharmacology studies, low gefapixant distribution to rat CNS and 
absence of dependence related observations in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and dog, it is 
unlikely gefapixant will increase the risk of dependence.

The Log Kow of gefapixant is lower than 4.5. A further PBT assessment is not required. PECsw is 0.45 
µg/L, which exceeds the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. The applicant did not seek to refine the Fpen. A Phase 
II assessment is warranted. Gefapixant is not PBT, nor vPvB. Considering the above data, gefapixant is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the non-clinical data provided, gefapixant has an inhibitory effect on ATP induced currents in 
P2X3 and P2X2/3 channels. However, an inhibitory effect on otherwise (mechanical and chemical) 
induced currents has not been investigated. More information on the specificity of gefapixant for ATP 
induced cough comes from published trial data, in which it was shown that gefapixant increased the 
ATP threshold and distilled water threshold to elicit a cough response; but that it had no effect on the 
threshold for the cough response for capsaicin and citron acid (chemical stimulant). This is reassuring 
from a safety perspective.  
In conclusion, the claimed specificity of gefapixant for ATP induced cough is a complex area under 
research which is not fully understood at the present time. A risk for inhibition of protective cough

induced by a mechanical or chemical stimulus cannot be ruled out in patients that are responsive to 
gefapixant, based on the current data. A credible explanation behind the observed gender differences 
on gefapixant exposure (from data from safety pharmacology studies) was provided – emesis after oral 
administration of the drug substance may affect the given outcome measure. A reasonable and 
comprehensive justification for not performing tissue distribution study in female individuals of non-
clinical species has been provided by the applicant and is considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
The applicant provided a discussion on the effects of sex, exposure and the occurrence of crystalluria in 
the rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies. Regarding the rat, the applicant concludes that higher 
incidence of crystals and crystal related nephropathy in female rats at high doses is driven by slightly 
higher systemic exposure (AUC) and Cmax values, likely leading to higher urinary concentration and 
crystal formation in female rats. Regarding the dog, the applicant argues that crystal related 
nephropathy was observed in a limited number of the animals, and the incidence was comparable 
between males and females in the one week and 3-month toxicity studies. In addition, although in the 
9-month study, a higher incidence of urinary crystals was observed in females, no associated increase 
related to histopathological findings were observed in females. The applicant concludes that data from 
gefapixant studies in both rats and dogs show no evidence of sex difference in sensitivity to crystalluria 
and related nephropathy. This is agreed by the CHMP. In addition, the applicant states that in the 
phase 3 study, no events of crystalluria have been reported as serious adverse events, and that when 
crystalluria was observed, occurrence was similar between male and female patients. 
The applicant has provided discussion and clarification regarding the findings of salivary gland 
vacuolation. The minimal to mild vacuolation of salivary gland epithelium was observed in the rat 
studies. It was not accompanied by any degenerative or inflammatory changes and was fully reversible 
after a 4 or 8-week recovery period. However, the clear aetiology of the vacuolation in the salivary 
gland is unknown. According to the applicant this finding was likely an adaptive change rather than an 
injury and was therefore considered a non-adverse finding. 
The applicant has explained that incidences of emesis were comparable between the vehicle-treated 
and gefapixant-treated dogs in toxicity studies of longer duration. Furthermore, the emesis was not 
harmful because, throughout the 28-day treatment period, animals at this dose did not show evidence 
of dehydration, changes in food consumption or body weight or any findings in the gastrointestinal 
tract. Given the lack of gefapixant-related emesis in the chronic duration study in dogs at doses of up 
to 35-fold the human clinical exposure, it can be considered not relevant in humans. In addition, the 
safety data from the clinical study indicate that the incidence of vomiting observed in the gefapixant 45 
mg BID dose group was low (< 4.5%) and comparable to the placebo-treated group. 
The applicant has provided a justification for the chosen testing strategy for the phototoxic potential 
evaluation of gefapixant, and it is considered valid.  
A discussion on the uveal tract binding mechanism of gefapixant was also supplied and admittedly, the 
reason for the apparent higher binding of gefapixant to melanin in the uveal region of the eye as 
compared to the skin remains unknown. However, given the following considerations that (i) melanin 
binding and retinal toxicity are two separate entities, (ii) photochemical characteristics of gefapixant 
provided by the applicant and the fact that wavelengths below 400 nm (those absorbed by gefapixant, 
i.e., between 290 and 350 nm) do not reach the retina of the adult human eye, it can be concluded 
that the possibility of phototoxicity of gefapixant is low. 
The water solubility of gefapixant was determined internally in a non-GLP study. An OECD 105 Water 
Solubility study is not required and, therefore, was not conducted. Of note, the non-GLP results were 
inadvertently reported as μg/L in the original environmental risk assessment; however, the units were 
incorrect. The actual solubility of gefapixant is pH dependent. At physiological pH in aqueous buffered 
solutions, the solubility varies from 140 mg/L at pH 5.23 to 10 mg/L at pH 8.1. Solubility increases 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 29/153 
 
 
 
significantly under acidic conditions; at pH 1.5, the solubility is >113 g/L. All aquatic toxicity tests were 
performed at or below the water solubility limit of gefapixant. The provided information was considered 
acceptable for submission.  
Although the adaptation of the DFOP-derived DT50 values is agreed upon, it should be noted that the 
recalculated DT50 values are likely an underestimation of the actual degradation half-lives. These DT50 
values were estimated to be 723 and 444 days, respectively. Furthermore, as the study was performed 
at 21°C, recalculation to 12°C should also have been performed. Nevertheless, as the slow-phase 
DFOP DT50 values for the total systems, including the %AS in NER are >1000 days, the conclusion on 
the persistence of the substance remains unchanged (vP) and the adaptations are considered 
acceptable. 
Gefapixant is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, it is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, toxicology and environmental risk assessment 
aspects of gefapixant have been adequately addressed. All non-clinical concerns of the CHMP were 
resolved. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

gefapixant. The effects of key intrinsic factors were evaluated in healthy adult subjects and patients 
with renal impairment. In addition, 7 Phase 1 trials evaluated the biopharmaceutical aspects. 
Moreover, reports covering in vitro data and population pharmacokinetic analysis are submitted.  
Two gefapixant API forms – free base and citrate salt – were used during the clinical formulation 
development. Gefapixant free base was developed to support early phase clinical trials, while 
gefapixant citrate was used in late clinical formulation development. Considering the 45 mg strength 
and the recommended dose of 45 mg b.i.d., gefapixant free base and gefapixant citrate can be 
considered low solubility drugs, based on BCS classification. The free base has a lower solubility at pH 
5.0 than citrate salt, i.e., 0.3 mg/ml vs. 9.3 – 12.1 mg/ml. Considering the low permeability of the 
drug, gefapixant is a BCS Class IV drug (low solubility/low absorption).  
Fully validated analytical methods have been applied for the analysis of gefapixant in plasma, urine 
and dialysate. Validation proved that the method was specific, precise, and accurate. Stability was 
shown covering study sample handling and storage. 
A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis (report 05HB0V) was performed across Phase 1, Phase 
2b, and Phase 3 trials with gefapixant at a 45 mg b.i.d. dose. The final structural population PK model 
is a 2-compartment model that includes a linear elimination from the central compartment, a first-
order absorption, and a lag time. The residual variability is modelled via an additive and proportional 
error model. The IIV was estimated for the Ka (CV = 85.7%), the Vc (CV = 12.7%), and the apparent 
clearance (CV = 27.1%). The prediction-corrected (pc)-VPC for Phase 1 data and Phase 2/3 data 
showed that the final model could predict the observed median and 5th and 95th percentiles of observed 
gefapixant concentrations with good accuracy. Based on stepwise covariate analysis, eGFR, age, body 
weight, and sex were statistically significant covariates of gefapixant pharmacokinetics. Although 
statistically significant, the magnitude of age, sex, weight, and race on gefapixant pharmacokinetics 
was < 20% and not clinically relevant. 
As data obtained from different formulations were included in the popPK, the applicant was requested 
to discuss the applicability of data obtained with early formulations, their inclusion in pop-PK models 
and whether formulation was used as a covariate in the analysis. From the response it was indicated 
that different formulations have been used across these studies. The population pharmacokinetic 
analysis was based on studies with F02 and/or the F04 / F04A / F04B formulations, respectively, 
whereas the formulation F01 was used for preliminary PK estimations only, but not in the final 
population PK analysis. As the F02 formulation was reformulated to avoid exposure differences under 
the fasted conditions, the food effect as a covariate was retained in the population PK model for the 
F02 formulation, and in general the approach is considered to be appropriate. However, the percent 
coefficient of variation (CV%) for absorption rate constant (Ka) is considerably high – 85.7 % 
suggesting considerable inter-individual variability. As different formulations have been used, their 
impact on absorption, next to other possible factors, cannot be excluded. It was requested to support 
that a slower absorption rate is not associated with lower exposure. Considering applicant’s response, 
although comparable tmax values were observed (range 1.0 – 4.0) hampering a good evaluation of a 
difference in absorption rate on the exposure, no food effect or a PPI effect on the F04 formulation is 
observed (study P025) and overall PK indicates that variability in exposure is moderate. Moreover, the 
exposure-efficacy relation is not steep and the effect of a difference in AUC (5th – 90th percentile) may 
be considered relatively small.  
Absorption  
In vitro permeability data indicate that gefapixant is a low permeability drug. Absolute bioavailability 
has not been evaluated, and based on the ADME study, the in vivo bioavailability is estimated to be at 
least 78%. It is expected that the pharmacokinetics of gefapixant is not different between healthy 
subjects and patients with refractory chronic and unexplained chronic cough. This is confirmed in the 
Assessment report

popPK analysis, showing that after accounting for the intrinsic covariates age, body weight and gender, 
there was no difference in gefapixant exposure between healthy subjects and subjects with chronic 
cough. 
Gefapixant is a substrate for P-gp but did not inhibit P-gp.  
After oral administration, gefapixant tmax values are observed after about 1 - 4h. No effect of food has 
been observed for the F04 formulation. Considering the small changes in excipients in the commercial 
F04B formulation compared to the F04 formulation, a comparable food effect is expected for the F04B 
formulation. The SmPC indicate that the tablet may be dosed without regard to food, which is 
appropriate. 
After single doses up to 450 mg and over the multiple b.i.d. dose range of 7.5 – 200 mg, linear 
pharmacokinetics is observed. As the recommended dose is 45 mg b.i.d., dose proportionality or non-
proportionality in the pharmacokinetics is not of concern. No unexpected accumulation is observed 
after multiple dosing b.i.d. dosing. Steady-state was reached within 2 - 3 days. The accumulation ratio 
was about 1.5-fold. 
Gefapixant pharmacokinetics shows a moderate inter-subject variability in AUC and Cmax of about 23 
and 29% under fasting conditions. Intra-subject variability was not evaluated; however, the ANOVA CV 
(as an indication of the intra-subject variability) in the bioequivalence study with the F04A and F04B 
tablet was 7 and 16%, respectively for AUC and Cmax, indicating that gefapixant can be considered a 
low variability drug. 
Different formulations were used in the clinical programme, i.e., a suspension, F01 and F02 tablets 
with gefapixant free base, F04 prototype tablets, F04A Phase 3 tablets and F04B commercial tablet 
formulations. The F04, F04A, and F04B formulations contained the gefapixant citrate salt. Due to the 
addition of citric acid, the F02 formulation had significantly less PPI effects than the F01 formulation. 
The direct compression tablet F04 formulation was developed for enhanced shelf stability, and this 
formulation was chosen for commercial use (F04B without citric acid). The relative difference in 
exposure under fasting and fed conditions is about -30% and -15%, respectively, for the F01 
formulation compared to the suspension formulation at a 450 mg single dose. The suspension 
formulation was only used in early development in study P001. The relative difference in exposure 
under fasting and fed conditions is about -20 to -25% for the F02 formulation compared to the F01 
formulation; however, dosed at a 150 mg b.i.d. dose. At a dose of 50 mg b.i.d., bioequivalence could 
be shown between the F01 and F02 tablet under fed conditions. The prototype F04 tablet formulation 
(s.d. 50 mg) was bioequivalent (AUC and Cmax) with the F02 formulation under fed conditions.  
Bridging of the 50 mg F04 tablet to the dose-proportional Phase 3 F04A 15 and 45 mg tablets was 
based upon comparable dissolution, which is acceptable. However, only dissolution data have been 
provided at a pH of 1.2 and 6.8, showing more than 85% dissolved within 15 min. Additional 
dissolution data at a pH of 5.0 has been submitted, showing slower dissolution for the F04 tablet, 
however, in vivo study comparison of exposure data following single oral dose administration of the 
F04 and F04A formulation in adult subjects showed comparable AUC and Cmax values. 
In the pivotal studies P010, P012, P014, P015, P027 and P030 7.5, 20 and 50 mg F01 and F02 tablets 
have been used and the F04A 15 and 45 mg tablets. The tablets were administered under fed 
conditions, so based upon studies P020, P025 and P040, there are no issues concerning exposure and 
possible bridging of the clinical results between these studies. However, 7.5 and 20 mg tablets were 
used, and the support of bridging of these formulations has been requested and addressed by the 
applicant during evaluation.

Distribution 
Gefapixant in vitro plasma protein binding is about 55% and not dependent on the concentration and 
drug-drug interactions due to protein displacement are not expected with gefapixant. Based upon 
limited animal data, gefapixant may cross the blood-brain barrier to a low extent, and it may transfer 
over the placenta and excrete into mother milk. The popPK estimated V/F is 133.8 l (Vc 101 l and Vp 
32.8 l), after b.i.d. administration of 45 mg. 
In vitro, gefapixant was metabolised at very low rates in human liver microsomes. Mono-oxidation, O-
demethylation and glucuronic acid conjugation were the major routes of metabolism observed. The 
involvement of CYP450 in the metabolism of gefapixant could not be determined due to the high 
metabolic stability of gefapixant. 
Following a single oral 14C-gefapixant labelled dose to healthy adult male subjects over a 1-week 
collection period, total recovery was 98.9% of the dose with the majority of radioactivity recovered in 
urine (76.4% of the dose), and a moderate amount recovered in faeces (22.6% of the dose). 
Gefapixant accounted for 64% and 20% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively. In plasma, 
gefapixant was the major component, accounting for about 88% of the total drug-related material in a 
sample representative of the exposure in a 24 h period. Minor metabolites were detected in plasma 
(M1, M5, M8, M11 and M13), and no metabolite in plasma was greater than 10% of the drug-related 
material based on the radiometric peak area. Minor metabolites were detected in urine ((M1, M5, M8, 
M11 and M13) and faeces (M5, M6, M11 and M13), each < 4.2% of the dose).  
These data indicate that metabolism is a relatively minor pathway of elimination, with approximately 
15% of an oral dose appearing in urine and faeces as metabolites. 
Elimination 
The observed clearance was 14.8 l/h. Based on the population-PK analysis integrating Phase 1, 2, and 
3 data, the geometric mean Cl/F is 10.8 l/h. Renal clearance was approximately 8.7 l/h, indicating that 
renal clearance is the major elimination pathway. The observed CLr was greater than the GFR for 
unbound gefapixant, indicating the involvement of active tubular secretion. The latter is confirmed in 
vitro, i.e., gefapixant is a substrate of MATE1 and MATE2K, P-gp, and BCRP transporters. After 
reaching peak levels, gefapixant plasma concentrations decline according to a biexponential disposition 
manner with a terminal t1/2 of approximately 6 to 10 hours. 
Special populations 
Based upon pharmacokinetic data and population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically significant 
effect of body weight and ethnicity (Japanese subjects) on the pharmacokinetics is observed.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis gender was identified as a significant covariate, and 
females had about 18% and 22% higher AUC and Cmax compared to males. After accounting for eGFR, 
age and gender were no longer significant factors in the model. 
Gefapixant exhibited low metabolic turnover following incubation with liver microsomes or hepatocytes. 
Consistent with the in vitro results, metabolism was observed as a minor route of elimination in the 
human ADME study, with approximately 14% of a dose of 14C-gefapixant recovered as metabolites in 
urine and feces. Therefore, no study was done to evaluate pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic 
impairment. The SmPC indicated that patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied, but no 
dose recommendation is given. As hepatic elimination is a relatively minor pathway, a dose adjustment 
based on hepatic impairment is not required. 
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans indicate renal excretion is the major elimination pathway for 
gefapixant in humans (i.e., about 64% of the dose was excreted unchanged in urine following a 50 mg 
Assessment report

single dose). A pronounced effect on the pharmacokinetics of gefapixant due to a renal impairment is 
observed, i.e. in subjects with a moderate and severe impaired renal function and in subjects with 
ESRD not on hemodialysis, AUC0-t increased 3.2-, 4.1- and 4.4-fold, respectively. In the popPK 
analysis, renal function was also indicated as a significant covariate for gefapixant exposure, i.e., in 
subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, the exposure was estimated to increase 
1.2-, 1.5- and 1.9-fold. Thus, there is a pronounced difference of the impact of an impaired renal 
function observed in the study and the estimation by the popPK analysis. This difference was 
considered to be due to the higher average eGFR values in normal participants in the renal impairment 
study P026 (median eGFR 122 ml/min/1.73 m2; n=6) compared to those in population PK analysis 
(mean eGFR 105 ml/min/1.73 m2; n=650). As a result, the subjects with RCC/UCC with normal renal 
function showed higher exposures than did the healthy subjects in study P026, and the observed 
exposure fold change in the subjects with renal impairment may have been overestimated in study 
P026. According to the applicant, the population-PK analysis, which included 1555 participants with 
chronic cough and 122 healthy participants, may reflect a more realistic prediction of the effects of 
renal impairment on exposures in the intended population. Subjects with ESRD requiring haemodialysis 
and on haemodialysis showed a 23% lower exposure compared to subjects not on haemodialysis, 
indicating increased clearance due to haemodialysis. 
Based on the estimated clinically relevant bounds for efficacy and safety (0.7 – 2.0) and based on the 
estimated increase in exposures by popPK analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with 
a mild and moderate renal impairment. 
Although the estimated increase in exposure in subjects with severe renal impairment was 1.9-fold and 
within the clinically relevant upper bound of 2.0, the exposure would lie primarily above the exposure 
range observed in Phase 3 studies. According to the applicant, adjusting the dose to bring the 
projected exposures within the range of clinical exposures seen in the Phase 3 studies will be most 
appropriate to limit unnecessary taste-related AEs. The projected steady-state Cmax and AUC following 
45-mg q.d. dosing in subjects with severe renal impairment are comparable to the projected Cmax and 
AUC following 45 mg b.i.d. dose in subjects with normal renal function, and a comparable efficacy is 
expected. Therefore, the SmPC recommends a 45 mg q.d. dose in patients with severe renal 
impairment.  
It is indicated that insufficient data are available in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring 
dialysis to make gefapixant dosing recommendations. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies  
In vitro data show that gefapixant is not a substrate for CYP enzymes. Gefapixant is a substrate 
MATE1, MATE2K, P-gp and BCRP. In vivo metabolism is a minor pathway for gefapixant elimination 
and the potential for clinically meaningful drug interactions for gefapixant with co-administration of 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP-enzymes or uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronic acid glucuronosyl transferase 
(UGT) enzymes is considered low. 
Inhibition of P-gp- and BCRP-mediated renal excretion of gefapixant could not be tested clinically as 
there are no specific inhibitors for which the necessary degree of inhibition could be achieved at 
physiologic doses. Active tubular secretion is estimated to contribute to no more than 50% of the total 
clearance, and as such, an increase in gefapixant exposure resulted from transporter inhibition would 
not be clinically significant, according to the applicant. Considering the maximal possible effects on 
absorption (+25%) combined with the effect on renal clearance (factor 2), a potentially significant 
effect of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on gefapixant pharmacokinetics cannot be ruled out. This issue has 
been further addressed by the applicant. In terms of oral absorption, the fraction absorbed for 
gefapixant was determined to be at least 78% in the human ADME study (P028), such that absorption 
is not limited to any significant extent by efflux mechanisms in the gut and the potential impact of P-gp 
Assessment report

or BCRP inhibition is anticipated to be limited. As for the elimination of gefapixant, it was estimated 
that active secretion (i.e. by transporters) contributed to less than 50% of the total clearance. As 
demonstrated in P036, a portion of active secretion is mediated by MATE1 and/or MATE2K. Given the 
observed involvement of MATE1 and/or MATE2K on active secretion as well as contribution from 
glomerular filtration, the potential impacts of P-gp or BCRP inhibition toward gefapixant elimination is 
minimised. Taken together, co-administration of inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP is not expected to lead to 
clinically relevant drug interactions. 
The inhibition of intestinal P-gp is expected to be of minimal effect on gefapixant exposure, as the 
fraction absorbed for gefapixant is at least 78%, so an increase caused by P-gp inhibition alone would 
not be clinically significant. 
In a single-dose study, the MATE1/MATE2K inhibitor pyrimethamine (50 mg, administered 3 h before 
gefapixant 45 mg) increased gefapixant AUC by 24%, which is considered not clinically relevant. The 
SmPC indicates no dose adjustment in case pyrimethamine is co-administered with gefapixant, as the 
change in exposure is considered not clinically relevant, which is agreed. 
Concomitant use of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole did not have a clinically meaningful effect on 
gefapixant pharmacokinetics. However, omeprazole has a pronounced effect on the exposure of the 
F01 formulation, and the extent of the effect depends on the gefapixant dose, fed/fast condition and 
omeprazole dose. At a 50 mg dose, the exposure decreased 31 – 60%. For the F02 formulation 
containing the free base and citric acid was added as an excipient, the effect of omeprazole was less 
pronounced, and at a dose of 25 - 50 mg, exposure increased 3 – 8%. A comparable effect was 
observed for the F04 formulation containing the citrate salt at a 50 mg dose (fast), with a 3% decrease 
in exposure. The latter results are also considered applicable to the commercial F04B formulation 
taking into account the quantitative and qualitative compositions. 
Considering the use of different formulations in the clinical studies and considering the pronounced 
different effect of a PPI on the exposure, the applicant was requested to indicate if PPIs have been 
used in the clinical studies. It appeared that in the Phase 3 studies, the F04 formulation has been used, 
for which no significant PPI effect was observed. This is also applicable for the F02 formulation used in 
Phase 2 studies at a relevant dose of 25 – 50 mg. Thus, although PPIs were used in these studies, a 
significant effect on pharmacokinetics is not expected based on data from previous (interaction) 
studies. 
In vitro, the potential of gefapixant to cause CYP inhibition or induction is low, and therefore it is 
unlikely that gefapixant would affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of other drugs. The inhibition 
potential of gefapixant concerning P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, and 
BSEP was evaluated in vitro using specific cell lines expressing these transporters. Based upon the 
observed in vitro IC50 values, gefapixant may inhibit OATP1B1, OCT1, MATE1 and MATE2K, although 
for the latter 2, values were just around the cut-off threshold for a possible in vivo interaction. 
Gefapixant (45 mg b.i.d.) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the OATP1 substrate pitavastatin (1 
mg). 
In light of a potential safety concern associated with precipitation in the urinary tract which could lead 
to inflammation and subsequent hyperplasia, it was requested to discuss potential effects of medicinal 
products/ food affecting urinary pH. It appeared that solubility of gefapixant is pH-dependent, with the 
lowest solubility in in the physiologic pH range for human urine. The steady-state aqueous solubility at 
pH 5 to pH 7, which is the normal pH range in human urine, was around 0.13 mg/mL, while at more 
acidic or alkaline conditions solubility tended to be increased, which suggests that medicinal products/ 
food products that could affect urinary pH are not expected to increase the risk of precipitation in the 
urine.

2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Gefapixant is a first-in-class, non-narcotic, peripherally active, oral selective antagonist of the P2X3 
receptor. Gefapixant also has activity against the P2X2/3 receptor subtype. Chronic cough observed in 
RCC and UCC is potentially related to activation of C-fibres via binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 
receptors. P2X3 receptors are ATP-gated ion channels found on sensory C fibres of the vagus nerve in 
the airways. C-fibres are activated in response to inflammation or chemical irritants and, when 
activated, initiate a cough reflex. ATP is released from airway mucosal cells under conditions of 
inflammation, and the binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors is sensed as a damage signal by 
C fibres, with subsequent activation. Studies conducted in animal models indicate that antagonism of 
either P2X3- or the closely related P2X2/3 receptor subtype reduces the responsiveness of C-fibre 
sensory neurons to ATP.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study MK7264-015: Study P015 is a Phase 2 study that examined the effect of MK-7264 50 mg and 
300 mg on cough reflex sensitivity of both capsaicin and ATP to access the cough reflex sensitivity in 
healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients. It is a one-dose, double-blind, randomised, 4-period, 
crossover study in male and female healthy and chronic cough subjects (Table 3).  
Table 3 Study design of cohort 1 (300 mg) 
* similar design for cohort 2 with 50 mg of AF-219 (=MK-7264) 
Participants were all non-smokers (given up smoking in the past 6 months and less than 10 (healthy 
subjects) or 20 (chronic cough subjects) pack-years. All participants had a maximal cough frequency 
evoked by challenge agent (Emax) ≥4 following the capsaicin challenge at Screening. Healthy subjects 
had to have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1 ≥80% at Screening. The chronic cough 
subjects had to have a treatment-refractory cough for at least one year (cough that is unresponsive to 
at least 8 weeks of targeted treatment for identified underlying triggers, including reflux disease, 
asthma, and post-nasal drip) and cough for which no objective evidence of an underlying trigger could 
be determined. A total of 50 subjects were randomised. In Cohort 1, 26 subjects received 1 dose of 
MK-7264 300 mg. In Cohort 2, 24 subjects received at least one dose of MK-7264 50 mg. 
The co-primary endpoints of cough reflex sensitivity were the maximal cough response (Emax) observed 
on inhalation of any concentration of tussive agent and the concentration of tussive agent causing 50% 
of the maximal cough response (ED50).  
Results: Pharmacodynamic modelling of the capsaicin- and ATP-evoked cough data showed similar 
results (Table 4 and Table 5). For capsaicin-evoked cough, the modelling detected a very small (<1

cough), but statistically significant reduction in Emax, i.e., the maximum number of coughs evoked was 
reduced for healthy subjects and chronic cough subjects during MK-7264 treatment compared with 
placebo. There was no significant effect on ED50. 
For ATP-evoked cough, Emax was not achieved by the maximum ATP concentration inhaled; therefore, 
only effects on ED50 were estimated. There was a significant increase in ED50, i.e., reduced cough 
reflex sensitivity, for both healthy subjects and chronic cough subjects during MK-7264 treatment 
compared with placebo; the reduction in ED50 during treatment was higher for chronic cough subjects 
who received 300 mg compared with chronic cough subjects who received 50 mg and healthy subjects.

Capsaicin-Evoked Cough Challenge 
Table 5 Summary of parameter estimates (Emax, ED50, and E0) based on the final model for 
the ATP-evoked cough challenge 
ATP did not evoke as many coughs as capsaicin, and in many subjects, C5 was not achieved for 
subjects on placebo treatment (i.e., the maximum concentration of ATP elicited <5 coughs). For 
analysis, a C5 concentration of double the maximum dose is generally imputed, as the C5 is known to 
be above the maximum concentration, but a decrease in sensitivity with MK-7264 (increase in C5) 
could not be detected in these circumstances. A significant (unadjusted p<0.05) reduction in cough 
reflex sensitivity induced by inhalation of ATP was observed for MK-7264 in chronic cough subjects, 
i.e., C2 (i.e., the maximum concentration of ATP eliciting 2 coughs) was increased at both 50 mg and 
300 mg MK-7264 doses and C5 was increased at 50 mg AF 219. However, in healthy subjects, no 
effect of MK-7264 on cough reflex sensitivity to ATP for C5 was observed at either dose; an increase in 
C2 was observed only for the 50 mg dose. 
Study MK7264-014: Study 014 is a similar phase 2 study as Study 015. It is a randomised, double-
blind, 2-period, crossover study of MK-7264 in healthy subjects and subjects with refractory or 
unexplained chronic cough. This study was exploratory for the cough reflex sensitivity assessment and 
not designed to assess the efficacy of MK-7264 in subjects with chronic cough. Participants were all 
non-smokers for at least 5 years. Healthy subjects had to have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
FEV1 ≥80% at Screening. The chronic cough subjects had to have a treatment-refractory cough for at 
least one year, cough for which no objective evidence of an underlying trigger could be determined and 
demonstrated significant cough symptoms by a score greater than 20/70 on the HARQ. The participant 
Assessment report

received a single dose as 2 MK-7264 tablets, 50mg tablets (100 mg total) and 2 placebo tablets, 
divided over two treatment periods and in Sequence A (first placebo) or B (first MK-7264). A total of 
36 subjects were randomised, and all completed the study. Overall, most subjects were female (88%), 
and healthy subjects (37.8 years) were younger than chronic cough subjects (61.1 years). Chronic 
cough subjects had a median history of cough of 12 years. Cough reflex sensitivity is measured by 
standard clinical methodology incorporating ATP, capsaicin, citric acid, and distilled water cough 
challenges.  
The co-primary endpoints are those concentrations of challenge agents that induce 2 or more (C2), 
and 5 or more (C5) coughs, respectively. These were the average C2 and C5 (concentrations inducing 
at least 2 coughs and 5 coughs, respectively) across 3-time points. 
Results: The results of the ATP cough challenge in chronic cough subjects showed a difference in the 
concentration required to induce C2 and C5 during the combined Treatment Periods 1 and 2 between 
MK-7264 and placebo groups (p<0.001 and p=0.007, respectively) (Table 6). In healthy subjects, 
there was no difference in the concentration required to induce C2 between the MK-7264 and placebo 
groups]; however, a significant difference was observed in the concentration required to induce C5 
between the MK-7264 and placebo groups (p=0.003) (Table 7). There were no observed meaningful 
differences in cough responses to capsaicin and citric acid challenge agents in the MK-7264 vs placebo 
groups for either healthy or chronic cough subjects during the combined Treatment Periods 1 and 2 
and in Treatment Periods 1 and 2 individually.

Secondary Pharmacodynamics: Gefapixant blocked hERG potassium currents with an IC20 and IC50 
of >100,000 nM (35,400 ng/mL, 148x the clinical Cmax free concentrations at 45 mg bid) and, 
therefore, did not provide any signal of concern.

In the non-clinical studies, no significant hemodynamic or ECG findings and no evidence of QTc interval 
prolongation were noted at doses of 15, 70, and 200 mg/kg in the conscious dog telemetry study. 
Concentration-QT analysis was performed using data from a single dose (P001) and multiple-dose 
(P007) Phase 1 trials to assess the effect of gefapixant doses on the QTc interval. Data from P001 
provided the broadest range of doses (10 mg to 1800 mg) with the highest exposure margin >15-fold 
(8168 ng/mL) over the predicted steady-state mean Cmax (531 ng/mL) for 45 mg BID. This trial also 
had an adequate placebo sample size and robust ECG sampling. The results showed no effect on the 
QTc interval up to single doses of 1800 mg. 
Results: The predicted mean placebo population-based QTc (QTcP]) and Fridericia-corrected QTc 
(QTcF) time-matched change from baseline estimate at Cmax and corresponding 90% CIs for 1800 mg 
administered in healthy male adults as a single dose in the fasted state were 3.64 (-0.39, 7.66) and 
2.45 (-1.74, 6.63), respectively, with the upper 90% CI limits falling below 10 milliseconds (msec). 
Data from P007 included both healthy and elderly adult male and female participants in a multiple-
dose (600 mg BID for 14 days) setting with the largest exposure margin >6-fold (3481 ng/mL) over 
the predicted steady-state mean Cmax (531 ng/mL) for 45 mg BID. The results showed no effect on the 
QTc interval up to multiple doses of 600 mg BID. The predicted mean placebo corrected QTcF time-
matched change from baseline estimate at Cmax and corresponding 90% CIs following gefapixant 600 
mg BID administered to healthy adult and elderly males and females for 14 days was - 2.60 (-5.87, 
0.68), with the upper 90% confidence limit falling below 10 msec. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetics were in general sufficiently addressed. A 45 mg formulation with gefapixant as 
citrate salt was selected based upon a rather extensive development programme. This formulation 
appeared not to have a food effect, and bioavailability was not affected by the administration of a PPI. 
Gefapixant is metabolised to a small extent (<20%), and the interaction potential, i.e., being a victim 
drug or acting as a perpetrator, is low. As renal excretion is the major elimination route, renal 
impairment is identified as a significant covariate. To prevent too high exposures in patients with 
severe renal impairment, a dose reduction to 45 o.d. is recommended. No major objections are 
identified concerning pharmacokinetics. 
Primary pharmacology  
In the PD studies, an effect of MK-7264 treatment on the ATP induced cough sensitivity was seen. 
However, the effect sizes for all tested doses 50, 100 and 300 mg were small, and the clinical 
relevance is questioned. Especially the effect of the 50mg dose is very modest. Furthermore, the 
studies have some serious setbacks (Emax not reached, C5 not reached, not all data available) that 
hamper a robust conclusion on the results. 
Secondary pharmacology  
In in vitro data and non-clinical studies, there were no signals to expect QTc prolongation. Therefore, a 
dedicated QTc study is not considered necessary. Instead, concentration-QT modelling was performed. 
which confirmed that gefapixant does not prolong QTc interval as in these models the upper 90% 
confidence limit was falling below 10 msec.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology testing concerning PK, PD effects of gefapixant is considered to be sufficient. 
Results are adequately reflected in the product information and in the agreed RMP. The CHMP did not 
consider any measures necessary to be addressed in the post-marketing phase. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The key efficacy data originate from 2 controlled Phase 3 studies: 
• 
•

Study  MK7264-043  –  a  12  week  placebo  controlled  trial  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
Gefapixant 45 mg in recent onset choric cough (< 12 months duration of RCC or UCC 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The recommended therapeutic dose of gefapixant is 45 mg BID, adjusted to 45 mg QD in the setting of 
severe Renal Impairment. The proposed gefapixant dose was evaluated based on the totality of data 
from individual trials and pooled analyses. A wide-dose range of gefapixant was evaluated in Phase 1 
trials to establish safety/tolerability in healthy participants. 
• 600 mg BID in a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial in participants with cough (P006) 
• 7.5 mg to 200 mg BID in a Phase 2a dose-escalation trial (P010) 
• 7.5, 20, and 50 mg BID compared with placebo in a 1:1:1:1 Phase 2b trial (P012) 
The PK and PD of gefapixant evaluated in 2 of these Phase 2 trials (P010 and P012) were used for 
population-PK and exploratory exposure-response analyses, and doses of 15 mg. 
Dose Selection for Phase 2 Programme 
No preclinical model for cough was available at the time of dose selection for Phase 2. Preclinical 
models that targeted pain associated with arthritis or bladder distension suggested that clinical doses 
in the range of 300 mg to 600 mg BID would achieve a pharmacologic effect. At the time of Phase 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 45/153 
 
 
 
 
start, approximately 140 participants had received at least 1 dose of gefapixant in 4 Phase 1 trials. 
These doses (up to maximum exposure at 1800 mg BID for 14 days) were generally well tolerated in 
Phase 1. The initial dose tested in the Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial (P006) was 600 mg BID for 14 
days, effectively reducing cough frequency. However, in this trial for cough (P006), participants had 
difficulty tolerating taste-related AEs, causing some participants to discontinue treatment at doses of 
300 mg BID and higher. 
Therefore, Study P010, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross over, dose-ranging Phase 
2a study in participants with RCC, initially evaluated a 50 mg to 200 mg BID dose range. However, no 
dose-response in the reduction of cough frequency. Therefore, a lower dose range of 7.5 mg to 50 mg 
BID was added. The Phase 2b Study P012 similarly tested doses of 7.5, 20, and 50 mg BID against 
placebo in four parallel groups of participants with RCC. The data from these 2 Phase 2 trials 
demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in the cough frequency and improvement in participant-
reported outcomes with doses ranging from 7.5 mg to 50 mg BID. Participants in these trials also 
experienced a dose-related increase in the taste-related AEs. 
Dose Selection for Phase 3 Programme 
The phase 3 programme tested 2 doses against placebo. The selected doses were 45 mg bid and 15 
mg bid. The 45 mg dose was selected based on a near-maximal effect with a tolerable safety profile. 
The 15 mg dose was selected as it was the minimal effective dose. The selection of the dose was based 
on exposure-safety models based on data collected in n= 812 patients that participated in several 
clinical phase 1 and 2 trials, including studies P010 and P012. 
The cough rate reduction increased from 7.5 mg to 30 mg and then plateaued at higher doses. Guided 
by the explorative analysis, the placebo model was used to account for the unconfounded drug effect, 
and the cough rate was modelled using an Emax function. The influence of proton-pump inhibitor use, 
underlying disease, history of chronic cough and age and gender were investigated using a standard 
SCM analysis. The effects of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors were evaluated on the model parameters 
baseline, placebo effect and drug effect (Emax). Gender was the only significant predictor for baseline 
cough rate and was retained in the model.  
The taste data from P012 was only used for the model development as it has data from a longer 
duration (12 weeks) relative to P006 (4 days/treatment arm). The taste disturbance endpoint for the 
modelling was assessed from the structured taste questionnaire that was administered to subjects only 
if a subject experienced a taste-related adverse event to determine “How frequently do you experience 
the taste effect after taking each dose of medication”, which is scaled from 1 to 5 with 1 representing 
never and 5 representing always. The taste disturbance endpoint was rederived to a binary end point- 
either the subjects had the taste effect irrespective of the frequency or not. Logistic regression was 
applied and an Emax model was shown to describe the exposure-response relation for taste disturbance 
best. All three exposure parameters were evaluated and Cmax performed relatively better compared to 
AUC and Ctrough. However, given that AUC is relatively less prone to prediction bias than Cmax, only 
sparse concentration sampling at trough was performed with P012 and since AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough 
were highly correlated, AUC was considered as the most robust exposure driver for E-R relationship. A 
fit for purpose TTE drop-out model was developed to facilitate trial simulations and predict reasonable 
drop-out patterns over the clinically relevant dose range (0 – 50 mg). Due to limited drop-out data and 
low power model discrimination, model selection was largely guided by scientific plausibility rather than 
statistical significance. A simple one-parameter constant hazard model with an Emax model to account 
for the effect of AUC described the data adequately. 
Simulations were performed to simulate the impact of important covariates on the exposure and to 
characterise the dose-response profile for cough reduction, taste effects and drop-out for a range of 
doses (0 – 50 mg, in steps of 2.5 mg) under consideration for Phase 3. A virtual population (n=250)

was obtained by randomly sampling patients from the available Phase 2 trial population with the 
covariate vectors of interest. The final popPK model was utilised to obtain individual PK parameters 
(CL, F1, V etc). For each dose level of interest, the PK parameters were used to obtain exposure 
estimates (AUC) for each patient. The simulations considered inter-individual variability and covariate 
effects. The placebo adjusted 24 h cough rate globally changes from baseline, placebo adjusted taste 
disturbance incidence, and the fraction of patients in the study at day 84 were simulated in the virtual 
population utilising the estimated PK exposures and the final E-R models. For each dose level, the 
median response was calculated. This procedure was repeated 1000 times by incorporating parameter 
uncertainty for estimated fixed effect parameters of the E-R models. For each dose level, median, 5th 
and 95th percentiles of cough, taste and drop-out outcomes from these 1000 runs were calculated to 
estimate the median and 90% CI, see Figure 3.

MK-7264-010: A Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Efficacy and Tolerance of MK-7264 
(AF-219) in Subjects with Refractory Chronic Cough 
Study MK-7264-010 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-escalation 
study of MK-7264 in subjects with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. The study included a high 
dose cohort (50mg-200mg, cohort 1) and a low dose cohort (7.5mg – 50 mg, cohort 2) to identify a 
dose that would decrease cough with minimal to no effect on taste. Enrolment in the second cohort did 
not begin until enrolment in the first dosing cohort had been completed. Each dosing cohort consisted 
of two 16-day treatment periods (MK-7264 or placebo). For cohort 1, there was a 3-7 day washout 
period; for cohort 2, there was a 14-21 day washout period.  
A total of 59 subjects were enrolled. In Cohort 1, 28 subjects received at least 1 dose of MK-7264; 
92.9% received at least one dose of MK-7264 200 mg. In Cohort 2, 30 subjects received at least one 
dose of MK-7264; 100.0% received at least one dose of MK-7264 50 mg. Mean exposure was 17 days

in either the MK-7264 or placebo group. Mean exposure was 16 days while in either the MK-7264 or 
placebo group. For cohort 1, three subjects discontinued the study due to AEs and one subject in 
cohort 2 discontinued due to AEs. 
Mean age across Periods 1 and 2 and for cohorts 1 and 2 was similar, approximately 63 years old. 
More women than men participated in the study; most subjects were White and non-Hispanic. 
The primary endpoint was the mean change of baseline in awake objective cough frequency (per 
hour), using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis to evaluate the results from this two-
period cross-over study. The derived change in Awake cough frequency measured at each dose were 
the repeated measures. The mixed-effect model included Period, Treatment, Dose Level, and all 
interaction terms as the fixed effects. Contrasts were constructed to compare the active treatment to 
the placebo for each individual dose level. The primary endpoints and responder analyses (≥ 30, 50 
and 70% cough reduction) were performed.  
Results 
Cohort 1 - At the end of treatment, mean (SD) change from Baseline in Awake cough frequency 
(Periods 1 and 2 combined) was -26.5 (37.79) cough/h in the MK-7264 50 mg dosing level compared 
to -0.4 (12.53) cough/h in the placebo group.  
Based on the mixed-effects model with period, treatment, dose level, and all interaction terms as fixed 
effects and baseline as a covariate for change from baseline, Awake cough frequency was significantly 
reduced from the Baseline for all MK-7264 dosing groups compared to placebo (p<0.001). The 
period/sequence effect was significant (p=0.047), so the results for each period were also 
summarised. For 50 mg dosing level, the LS mean difference (95% CI) was -22.6 (- 34.4, -10.8) 
cough/h for Periods 1 and 2 combined, -29.7 (-46.5, -12.9) cough/h at Period 1, and -15.4 (-32.0, 
1.1) cough/h at Period 2. 
Based on the mixed model analysis based on log-transformed data statistically significant reduction in 
Awake Cough Frequency for all MK-7264 dosing levels was observed compared to placebo (p-value 
<0.008). The difference between MK-7264 and placebo was also estimated by percent change, which 
is calculated by 100 (ediff - 1), where diff =LS mean difference from mixed model of change from 
baseline based on log-transformed data. The significant percent change was -41.2% (95% CI: -59.3%, 
-15.1%) relative to placebo for 50 mg and the percent change was -52.0%, -46.9%, and - 57.1% 
relative to placebo for 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg, respectively.

Cohort 2 - At the end of treatment, mean (SD) change from Baseline in Awake cough frequency 
(Periods 1 and 2 combined) was -24.3 (35.48) cough/h in the MK-7264 50 mg dosing level compared 
to 1.1 (23.39) in the placebo group. Based on the mixed-effects model for change from baseline, 
Awake cough frequency was significantly reduced from Baseline (p<0.001) for MK-7264 30 mg and 50 
mg doses. LS mean difference (95% CI) was -24.6 (-37.1, -12.0) for 30 mg and - 23.8 (-35.9, -11.7) 
for 50 mg. MK-7264 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses reduced Awake cough frequency compared with placebo 
by LS mean (95% CI) was -6.9 (-18.0, 4.3) and -9.0 (-18.3, 0.3), respectively. The period/sequence 
effect was not significant (p=0.129).

Based on the mixed model analysis based on log-transformed data, a statistically significant reduction 
in Awake Cough Frequency for MK-7264 15 mg, 30 mg, and 50 mg was observed compared to placebo 
(p-value <0.027). The difference between MK-7264 and placebo was also estimated by percent 
change, which is calculated by 100 (ediff - 1), where diff =LS mean difference from a mixed model of 
change from baseline based on log-transformed data. The significant percent change was -55.9% 
(95% CI: -71.9% - 30.8%) relative to placebo for 50 mg and the percent change was -14.7%, -
25.2%, and -37.1% relative to placebo for 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg, respectively. 
Three responder variables were define based on the magnitude of percent change from baseline Awake 
objective cough frequency.

Cohort 1 - For the 50 mg dosing level (Periods 1 and 2 combined), MK-7264 had greater response 
rates compared to the placebo group: 58.3% vs. 12.0% for ≥30% decrease in cough frequency, 
46.2% vs. 0% for ≥50% decrease, and 34.6% vs. 0% for ≥70% decrease.

Secondary Endpoint Results:  
Daily Cough Severity Diary 
At the end of treatment (Periods 1 and 2 combined), both cohorts showed a statistically significant 
improvement in the Daily Cough Severity dairy for the MK-7264 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg doses, 
while numeral improvements were observed for the MK-7264 50 mg dose.

MK-7264-012: A 12-Week Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of (AF-219) MK-7264 in 
Subjects with Treatment Refractory Chronic Cough 
This was a 12-week randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MK-7264 in 
subjects with treatment-refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Two-hundred and fifty-three subjects 
who met entry criteria were randomly assigned to MK-7264 (dosing 7.5 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg) or 
matching placebo for up to 84 days. Of the 31 (12.3%) subjects who discontinued prematurely, one 
subject was discontinued due to ‘investigator decision’ before study treatment was started, and the 
majority discontinued due to adverse events. In the 50 mg arm, 20.6% discontinued compared to 79% 
in the placebo arm.

Figure 6 Study diagram P012 
Patients were included with a Chest radiograph or CT thorax within the last 5 years, not demonstrating 
any abnormality considered to be significantly contributing to the chronic cough, and with a diagnosis 
of refractory chronic cough or unexplained cough for at least 1 year. They also had to have a score of 
≥ 40mm on the Cough Severity VAS at Screening.  
Patients were excluded when they were a smoker or had given up smoking in the past 6 months prior 
to study entry. Initiation of treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor within 4 
weeks prior to the Baseline Visit (Day 0) or during the study was not allowed, and FEV1/FVC < 60% 
was also not allowed. Other exclusion criteria were for example, respiratory tract infection in last 4 
weeks, history of bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis, opioid use in last week, requirement of prohibited 
medications.  
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in awake cough frequency after MK-7264 therapy 
at each dose studied after 12 weeks (Day 84) of treatment. The primary endpoint was analysed using 
a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis (log-transformed awake cough frequency). The 
primary efficacy endpoint comparisons for all active doses versus placebo were controlled for 
multiplicity (for the three comparisons of MK-7264 50 mg to placebo, MK-7264 20 mg to placebo, and 
MK-7264 7.5 mg to placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint in a hierarchical manner). All other 
efficacy endpoints were tested at the 0.05 level of significance without multiplicity adjustment. 
Results 
More women than men participated in the study; most subjects were white and non-Hispanic. 
Subjects’ history of smoking and their FEV1/FVC ratio were similar across treatment groups. All other 
baseline characteristics were also generally similar across the treatment groups. 
Primary Endpoint (Awake Cough Frequency at Week 12): 
The primary efficacy hypothesis of the study was met. At Week 12, there was a significant reduction in 
awake cough frequency in the MK-7264 50 mg group compared to placebo (p = 0.003). The percent 
change from baseline in awake cough frequency was -37% (95% CI: -53.3% to -14.9%) relative to 
placebo. The percent changes from baseline in awake cough frequency in the MK-7264 20 mg (-
22.2%, p=0.093) and 7.5 mg (-22.0%, p=0.097) groups at Week 12 were not statistically significant 
compared to placebo (Figure 7).

Key secondary outcomes 
The key secondary endpoints (awake cough frequency at week 4 and 8; 24h cough frequency and 
Cough Severity VAS) support the primary outcome with statistically significant improvements with 
placebo observed with the high dose with gefapixant 45 mg and numerical improvements with the two 
lower doses of 20 mg and 7.5 mg.  
Discussion on the dose-response studies  
The dosing of gefapixant was investigated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 
studies (P010, P012) in patients with refractory or unexplained cough. The dose selection is based on 
clinical outcome measures, i.e., the reduction of cough frequency. No additional pharmacodynamic 
parameters, i.e., the ATP or capsaicin threshold for the induction of cough or capsaicin was 
investigated.  
The dose escalation Study P010 identified the dosages on the steep part of the dose-response curve. It 
showed that the MK-7264 50 mg bid dose resulted in the maximal effect on the cough reduction. A 
higher dose did not result in a much larger benefit. 
The 7.5 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg bid dosages were investigated in the study P012 to provide l 12-week 
treatment data to support the dose selection for the pivotal phase III phase.  
Study 012 showed a significant reduction in awake cough frequency in the MK-7264 50 mg group 
compared to placebo (p = 0.003), while numerical improvements were observed with the lower 
posology of 20 mg and 7.5 mg. The results are supported with secondary outcomes including the 
Cough severity VAS, a patient reported outcome.    
Conclusion  
The design of the studies is adequate to support the selected dosages in the range of 7.5 mg and 50 
mg bid. Further support for the dose selections (i.e., 15 mg bid and 45 mg bid) is provided by the 
exposure-effect simulations.

2.5.5.2.  Studies to validate the cough recording procedure  
Introduction  
For the two main studies, a new outcome measure was used, i.e., the relative reduction in cough count 
per hour measured during a 24-hour period. Coughs were recorded using a VitaloJAK recording device. 
Where possible these recordings were compressed to remove silence and non-cough sounds, and the 
coughs were tagged by trained cough analysts for counting.  
During the assessment procedure, concerns were raised by the CHMP relating to the validation of the 
VitaloJAK cough counting system. While the VitaloJAK is validated as an FDA cough recording device 
and is a CE marked medical device, the full system including the compression cough counting 
algorithm and manual cough tagging by multiple trained cough analysts has not been adequately 
validated against what was considered to be the “gold standard” for manual cough count: the 
uncompressed cough recordings.  
The results from the two main studies were based on cough count data which were compressed using 
a combination of the version 2.0 compression algorithm with dual channel processing, version 3.0 
algorithm with dual channel processing, and version 3.0 algorithm with single channel processing. 
During assessment, the applicant developed and conducted a (1) study to validate the Recordings 
Compressed with Software Algorithm WH03 v3.0, Single Channel Processing and (2) a study to 
evaluate the inter-rater reliability of cough counting. The CHMP consulted the Methodology Working 
Party (MWP), to receive input on specific questions regarding both study protocols (see section 2.5.6).  
Description of the validation studies  
I. 
Validation of 24-Hour Cough Frequencies Ascertained Using Recordings 
Compressed with Software Algorithm WH03 v3.0, Single Channel Processing and 
Proprietary Phase 3 Data 
During the main studies P027 and P030, three different software compression algorithms were used 
i.e., Version 2.0 is dual compression channel (based on data from 2 microphones); Version 3.0 had 
two variations: single channel (compressing based on the recording from the chest sensor only) and 
dual channel. The applicant decided only to validate the single channel compression algorithm WHO3 
v3.0, because this compression algorithm was considered closest to the “gold standard” of 
uncompressed recording. This algorithm removes less of the uncompressed recording compared with 
both dual compression algorithms, while, in addition, a previous validation study showed less variation 
in cough counts than with dual channel compressions. 
Objective 
The primary objective of the study was to measure the agreement between the 24-hour cough 
frequencies (coughs per hour) from uncompressed cough recordings and recordings compressed using 
WH03 v3.0 single channel processing. 
Methods 
Cough recordings from studies P027 and P030, including those with quality events (per Vitalograph 
SOPs), ≥ 20 hours were eligible for inclusion. Recordings were randomly selected based on subject ID 
from all visits (baseline and post-baseline recordings) using a random seed to be approximately 
representative of the age, sex, and underlying aetiology of the cough (refractory chronic cough and 
unexplained chronic cough), as well as approximately evenly distributed across quintiles of cough

counts observed in the Phase 3 trials. Only one recording per participant included in the primary 
efficacy analysis was selected.  
Recordings were selected across each quintile of cough counts per 24-hour recording observed in the 
Phase 3 data: Q1 0-100, Q2 101-210, Q3 211-366, Q4 367-655, Q5 656-25331. About equal numbers 
of recordings within each quintile were selected for inclusion. Slightly more recordings were selected 
from Q5 than in the other quintiles, as there was a concern that the highest range of cough counts in 
the phase 3 trials was not adequately represented in the original validation study. 
Each individual cough analyst tagged coughs for one of the two formats (uncompressed or 
compressed) for any selected recording to eliminate potential bias from an analyst remembering a 
particular recording that he/she has tagged before in a different format. Cough analysts were blinded 
to tags on recordings in other formats and were trained using the same Vitalograph SOPs used 
throughout the Phase 3 P027 and P030 clinical trials. All cough analysts received the same training and 
certification. They were blinded to treatment assignment and previous cough counts for a given 
recording. 
Statistical Analyses  
As a primary analysis, a modified Bland-Altman plot with percent difference plotted against the gold 
standard was performed. In this study, the percent difference (the difference between the 24-hour 
cough frequencies from the uncompressed and compressed files (using WH03 v3.0, single channel 
processing) divided by the uncompressed 24-hour cough frequencies*100) is used to assess the 
degree of agreement between 24-hour cough frequencies from compressed recordings versus 24-hour 
cough frequencies in uncompressed recordings.  
Considering the experts’ opinions, the applicant proposed a 10% maximal allowed difference (MAD), 
but based on health authority feedback, the applicant used 5% as the MAD for the Bland-Altman plot. 
The Limits of agreement are the range of values within which 95% of the percent differences are 
expected, assuming a normal distribution. These limits are calculated as mean percent difference ± 
1.96 x standard deviation of percent difference, assuming a normal distribution of the within subject 
percent differences in 24-hour cough frequencies between uncompressed and compressed recordings. 
The 95% confidence limits (CI) of the 95% LOA were calculated as LOA ± 1.96 x √(3⁄n) x S, where S 
is the standard deviation of percent difference. If the upper limit of the 95% CI of upper LOA and the 
lower limit of the 95% CI of lower LOA were within MAD of percent difference (for this study, MAD = 
5%), then the applicant concluded there was agreement in cough counts between compress and 
uncompressed records.  
The LOA along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals was plotted and reported in a table. 
The protocol also described various alternative methods in case normally distribution of the data was 
not achieved i.e., Deming/Passing Bablok analyses and a sensitivity analysis using alternative limits 
agreement based on a folded normal or half normal distribution. This latter sensitivity analysis was not 
performed. 
Matlab and an excel lookup table were used to compare the cough tag positions between the 24h 
uncompressed and compressed recordings. This software was developed to compare cough counts 
from two or more cough analysts. It reports tags from the two recordings as matching if they are 
within 1000 sample points (125msec) of each other. This time window was chosen based on the typical 
length of cough sounds which is 200-300msec, and therefore, a second explosive cough sound could 
not be performed in this time window. For each recording the lookup table generated a table 
documenting the number of matched tags, tags present in the 24h recording but not the compressed 
and also tags present in the compressed but not 24h recording. 
 A second piece of software (validation software) utilised the ‘output file’ data to determine which of 
the unmatched tags in the 24h files were removed by the WH03 algorithm i.e., the sound was no 
Assessment report

longer present in the compressed file, and therefore could not be tagged. This process also determined 
which sounds tags in the 24h files were retained by the algorithm but not subsequently tagged by the 
cough analyst in the compressed file. 
Based on the processes described above all tags can be classified as follows: 
1. Matched tags; tags present within both the 24h and compressed files for the same cough sound 
2. Tags present in the 24h recording file but not the compressed, subclassified as 
a. algorithm removed 
b. algorithm retained 
3. Tags present in the compressed recording but not the 24h recording file 
Results  
The main results of this validation study are shown in the Bland-Altman Plots on different scales in 
(Figure 10, Figure 11, and Figure 12). Each point represents one recording. In Figure 10, the Bland-
Altman plot shows the LOA and several points outside the pre-specified MAD of 5% (shown in red and 
with the bolded line). The outliers outside the MAD appear at low cough frequencies. A comparison of 
Figure 10 and Figure 12 demonstrates that at the low cough frequencies, a small absolute difference 
can translate to a high relative percentage difference.  
The points are approximately evenly distributed above and below 0, although the mean of the 
differences is slightly above 0 suggesting that, on average, the uncompressed recordings result in a 
higher cough count than the compressed recordings.

The applicant performed an investigation into the recordings that had a discrepancy outside the 5% 
MAD. There were no clear patient characteristics that were associated with these recordings. 
Furthermore, based on the analysis of the position of the cough tags, it was determined that most of 
the discrepancies were due to a difference in the cough analyst and not the removal of any cough-like 
sounds from the compressed recording from the uncompressed recording. In 2/13 recordings it was 
determined that the discrepancy was primarily due to the algorithm, and in an additional one recording 
the discrepancy was a combination of both the algorithm and manual cough count. 
II. 
Inter-rater Reliability of Cough Counting for Cough Recordings  
This cross-sectional study assessed and documented the inter-rater reliability among blinded trained 
cough analysts to identify coughs from the uncompressed and compressed recordings (WH03 v3.0, 
single channel processed). A total of 20 recordings of 20 subjects were randomly selected from studies 
P027 and P030 across each quintile of cough counts. The selection of recordings was the same as for 
the study that validated the compression algorithm. Recordings that were included in the validation 
study were not eligible for the inter-rater reliability study.  
Eight cough analysts were randomly selected from a pool of cough analysts trained using the same 
Vitalograph SOPs used throughout the two phase 3 clinical trials, and would therefore, be reflective of 
the population of cough analysts. All cough analysts received the same training and certification. Each 
cough analyst tagged both the compressed and non-compressed data from each of the 20 cough 
recordings. The order of the compressed or non-compressed recording was random and there was a 
timeframe of at least four weeks before the same analyst counted the other version of the same cough 
recording.  
Statistical Analysis  
The intraclass correlation was reported for all uncompressed and compressed recordings in this inter-
rater reliability study. In this analysis, the intraclass correlation (ICC), ICC type (2,1) was calculated to 
assess the inter-rater reliability. The case 2 model is a two-way random effects model that was used to 
calculate the ICC, considering that both recording and cough analyst effects were random.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 58/153 
 
 
 
 
 
ICC type (2,1) represents that the intention to: generalise the reliability results to any raters who 
possess the same characteristics as the selected raters in the reliability study, that it is interested in 
absolute agreement between the analysts, and that it is interested in a single measurement (not a 
mean of multiple measurements).Observed agreement between cough analysts as measured by ICC 
(2,1) ≥0.996 was set as the threshold to conclude sufficient inter-rater reliability.  
The percent coefficient of variation (PCV=100*standard deviation/mean) across analysts was also 
calculated for each recording. As an exploratory objective, Bland-Altman plots were also used to assess 
agreement between cough counts from compressed and uncompressed recordings, as was done in the 
compression algorithm validation study.  
Results  
The ICC was ≥0.996 for both compressed and uncompressed recordings, respectively, indicating that 
the study met the success criteria, see below.  
Table 8 Intraclass correlation 
All except for one recording had a percent of coefficient of variation (% CV) of <5%; the only 
exception referred one missed cough by 1 of the 7 analysts in a recording that only reported 4 cough 
counts. As with the validation of the compression algorithm, the largest %CV was observed in the 
recordings with the lowest cough frequencies. 
Discussion on the validation studies  
The applicant provided the results from two validation studies: i.e. a validation study of the 24-Hour 
Cough Frequencies Ascertained Using Recordings Compressed with Software Algorithm WH03 v3.0, 
single channel processing, an inter-rater reliability study, which was also based on recordings 
compressed with Software Algorithm WH03 v3.0, single channel processing.  
Single channel compression algorithm WHO3 V3.0: Based on the results from the validity of the 
compression algorithm, it is concluded that the Recordings Compressed with Software Algorithm WH03 
v3.0, single channel processing is valid. Although there were some compressed recordings that were 
outside the maximum acceptable difference, these were from patients with a low cough frequency 
which meant that a small absolute difference resulted in a high difference on the relative percent scale. 
Furthermore, an investigation of these discrepancies identified that most of the discrepancies were due 
to the analyst differences and not the removal of relevant cough-like sounds by the algorithm.  
It is important to note that the version 2.0 and version 3.0 compression algorithms for the dual 
channel processing were not part of the validation study. The results for the primary and secondary 
endpoints that were provided in the CSR are based on data containing around 90% of recordings that 
were compressed using dual channel processing.  
Inter-rater reliability: Based on feedback received from the CHMP Methodology Working Party (MWP), 
the applicant prepared a protocol version and final report, for which the primary measurement of 
interest was the intraclass correlation coefficient. The results from the inter-rater reliability study 
support a conclusion that the level of agreement between cough analysts is acceptable when 
compression algorithm WHO 3 V3 is used. Similar to what was observed in the validation study of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 59/153 
 
 
 
 
 
compression algorithm, the differences in the low cough frequency recordings resulted in a larger 
coefficient of variation.  
Overall conclusion  
Based on the validation studies based on the recordings compressed with Software Algorithm WH03 
v3.0, single channel processing, V3.0 it can be concluded that the full VitaloJAK system is valid for use 
in the clinical studies.  
2.5.5.3.  Main studies 
The core efficacy data originate from Phase 3 Studies MK7264-027 and MK7264-030, which are almost 
duplicate studies except for their treatment duration of the main study phase, that is 12 weeks and 24 
weeks, respectively, when the main efficacy endpoints were measured. Both studies were followed by 
a blinded extension period of 40 weeks (study P027) or 24 weeks (study P030). In the extension 
period, additional patient reported outcomes and safety data were collected.

Participants were also to refrain from the consumption of alcohol 24 hours prior to and after all study 
visits (including the PK sampling visits). On intermediate days, alcohol consumption was limited to no 
more than approximately 3 alcoholic beverages per day. Participants were to abstain from strenuous 
exercise and avoid noisy environments while the VitaloJAK monitor was attached over a 24-hour 
period. However, participants were allowed to participate in light recreational activities.

Description of the assessment for the primary efficacy endpoint  
Method of cough counts: The cough data for the primary analyses were collected by the VitaloJAK 
system. The VitaloJAK system consists of Audio-recording device, a Web-portal, compression algorithm 
and human cough counts. The VitaloJAK audio recording device has been FDA cleared as an audio 
recording system and is CE marked. The Web-portal, compression algorithm and manual cough counts 
are not FDA cleared but supported with an additional validation study. 
Audio-recording system: Cough counts were measured using a digital recording device (VitaloJAK). 
Microphones were affixed to the participant’s chest wall and attached to the participant’s clothing; the 
device provides high fidelity recordings and facilitates signal processing to identify and quantify cough 
accurately. The device uses two input channels - the first records sounds from the lungs and trachea 
through a chest contact sensor, which is attached to the skin at the top of the sternum. The second 
channel captures ambient sounds through a lapel air microphone. Data were collected for a 24-hour 
recording period when the participant was both awake and asleep. 
Compression algorithm: The collected digital recordings were processed in a centralised reading centre, 
where recordings are condensed using a computer algorithm (compression algorithm) before human 
analysts identified and tagged individual coughs. The compression algorithm was developed to remove 
the non-cough sounds and silent parts for the recording to facilitate the readout by analysts.   
During the main study, a total of three different versions of the compression algorithm were used:  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 63/153 
 
 
 
 
-  Version 2.0 dual compression channel (based on data from 2 microphones i.e., one chest and one 
lapel microphone) 
-  Version 3.0 dual channel  
-  Version 3.0 single channel (compression based on the recording from the chest sensor only) 
Single channel compression algorithm WHO3V3.0: After CHMP’s concerns had been raised during the 
evaluation about the validity of the data generated by these compression algorithms, the applicant 
validated the compression algorithm Version 3.0 single channel compression algorithm, resulting in a 
recount of about 90% of the originally presented data. The efficacy results based on this data set are 
referred to as “recount data set.”  
Cough count analyses: After a training period, the cough analysts performed a manual cough count on 
the compressed data, or uncompressed data in cases where it was not possible to apply the 
compression algorithm. The analysts listened to both audio channels simultaneously and inspects the 
visual waveforms: the use of concurrent review of both an audio presentation and visual wave form of 
the cough sound (i.e., characteristic explosive phase followed by an auditory phase) facilitates 
discrimination of true cough events from other forceful ambient noises. The cough sounds were 
manually tagged by the cough analysts and counted. The analysts reviewed the data in a blinded 
manner. 
Quality checks cough monitoring  
Original data  
During the study, the cough analysts were subject to continuous monitoring to ensure the quality. 
Recordings to be recounted were selected at random from each set of cough counts that the analyst 
had worked on in the previous week. A comparison between the original and recounted results was 
made. If the QA results were not within the acceptable limits, i.e., 5% of the counted and the 
recounted segments are outside the limits of ±4 coughs per hour, an investigation was conducted to 
determine the source of poor agreement.  
From the Phase 3 studies, an Intra class correlation ICC (case 1, each subject is measured by a 
different set of k randomly selected raters) was calculated on hourly segment randomly selected 
recordings chosen for recounting once the trial was completed to assess the interrater reliability.  
- 
- 
In Protocol 27, the ICC was 0.999. The mean difference between analysts was -
0.00791coughs/hour (range -28 to + 19) 
Protocol 30, the ICC was 0.998. The mean difference between analysts was 0.0447 
coughs/hour (range -32 to +72) 
Recount data  
Following the validation of the single channel compression algorithm v3.0, all other recordings that 
were compressed using either of the two dual channel algorithm versions were recompressed and 
recounted (>90% of recordings). 
During the recount, the applicant performed a stricter QA process check during recount. The recordings 
were broken into blocks of ~ 220 recordings. Once all recordings in a block were analysed, 20 
recordings were selected at random from the block and recounted blind by a second analyst. The 
Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for each block was calculated and plotted longitudinally to 
ensure the process is in control; per SOP if the ICC fell to 0.9965 or lower, additional investigation 
would be required. Bland-Altman Plots using limits of agreement of +/-50 coughs per session were 
used as a monitoring tool.

Description of assessment scales for secondary endpoints 
Cough severity diary (CSD): The CSD is a 7-item, disease-specific electronic PRO measure with a recall 
period of “today”. A CSD total score, and 3 domain scores (frequency, intensity, disruption) can be 
calculated. A mean improvement of 1.3 and 2.7 points in the mean weekly CSD total score was 
observed for those reporting themselves on the PGIC as at least “minimally improved” and “much 
improved”, respectively. 
Cough severity Visual Analog Scale (VAS): The Cough Severity VAS is a single-item question asking 
the participant to rate the severity of their cough “today” using a 100 mm VAS anchored with “No 
Cough” at 0 and “Extremely Severe Cough” at 100. Based on the results from MK-7264 Protocol 012, 
analyses to define a clinically meaningful reduction in cough severity indicated that a reduction of ≥30 
mm was found to be predictive of patient-reported improvement in cough as rated on the PGIC 
questionnaire.  
Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ): The LCQ is a 19-item cough-specific HRQoL questionnaire that 
contains three domains (physical, psychological, and social), calculated as a mean score for each 
domain ranging from 1 to 7 and a total score ranging from 3 to 21. Each item on the LCQ assesses 
symptoms or the impact of symptoms on HRQoL over the past two weeks using a 7-point Likert scale 
ranging from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. Data obtained from the LCQ intended to 
provide information on the impact of chronic cough on patients’ daily lives, beyond objective cough 
counts and severity. An increase of the LCQ score ≥ 1.3 points is considered the minimal clinically 
important difference (MCID).  
•  Sample size 
P027: The sample size calculations were based on the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, 
with the following assumptions based on Protocol 012 data: 
1. 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 
•  Relative reductions in change from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 are 20% in 
MK-7264 15 mg BID and 30% in MK-7264 45 mg BID 
• 
• 
The common standard deviation (SD) of the change from baseline in log-transformed 24-hour 
coughs per hour is 0.7 
The number of coughs per hour follows an approximately log-normal distribution 
2. Awake coughs per hour at Week 12 
•  Same assumptions as to the primary efficacy endpoint of 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 
3. Proportion of participants with ≥30% reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at  
Week 12 
• 
The proportion of responders in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 is 54%, 66%, and 73% 
in placebo, MK-7264 15 mg BID, and MK-7264 45 mg BID, respectively 
Based on the assumptions above, Table 9 provides power for the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints with a total of 720 participants (240 participants per treatment group). All calculations are 
based on a 2-sided α=0.0499 significance level. The dropout rate is expected to be 12% at Week 12.

Table 9 Power for primary and secondary endpoints 
P030: Under the same assumptions, Table 10 provides the power calculations for the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints with 1290 participants (430 participants per treatment group). All 
calculations were based on a 2-sided α=0.0499 significance level. The dropout rate was expected to be 
20% at Week 24. Unlike study P027, the difference in the LCQ responder rate with placebo was 
included as a secondary outcome.

Randomisation occurred centrally using an interactive response technology (IRT) system. There were 3 
study intervention arms. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1:1 ratio to MK-7264 45 mg BID, 
MK-7264 15 mg BID, or placebo. Randomisation was be stratified according to the following factors: 
gender and geographical region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, other). 
A double-blinding technique with in-house blinding was used. The participant, the investigator, and the 
sponsor involved in the study intervention administration or clinical evaluation were unaware of the 
group assignments. Since MK-7264 45 mg and 15 mg differed in appearance and had corresponding 
matching placebos, participants received two study treatment bottles. 
•  Statistical methods 
Estimand 
The objective of this study was to examine the reduction in 24-hour coughs/hour across gefapixant 
and placebo at Week 12 (P027) or at Week 24 (P030) in patients with UCC or RCC, regardless of 
treatment/study discontinuation or the use of prohibited medication. The variable to address the 
clinical question was the change from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 (P027) or at 
Week 24 (P030). Intercurrent events were to be handled through a treatment policy strategy. It was 
intended that data continue to be collected after treatment discontinuation and/or during usage of 
prohibited medication and were used as-is in the analysis.

Efficacy analysis populations 
• 
Primary analyses as proposed by the applicant  
The FAS population was to serve as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in this 
study. The FAS population consisted of all randomised participants who had taken at least 1 dose of 
the study intervention. For the original analyses presented in the CSR, inclusion in the primary and 
secondary analyses required that participants provided a baseline measurement and at least 1 post-
baseline measurement during the treatment period.  
The PP population excludes participants due to important deviations from the protocol that may 
substantially affect the results of the primary efficacy endpoint. Potential deviations that may exclude a 
participant from the PP population were prespecified in the sSAP. The final determination on important 
protocol deviations, thereby the composition of the PP population, will be made prior to the first 
unblinding of the database and documented in a separate memo. A supportive analysis using the PP 
population may be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint if the proportion of the participants 
with important protocol deviations is >10%. 
Participants are included in the treatment group to which they are randomised to analyse efficacy data 
using both the FAS and PP populations. 
•  Additional efficacy analysis population (CHMP specified) 
Additional efficacy analysis population was requested during the assessment, this being the ITT 
population of all participants randomised to one of the three arms regardless of whether they had 
baseline or post-baseline data available. It was considered that the use of the ITT population more 
closely reflects the treatment policy estimand. Officially, this ITT efficacy analysis population is a 
modified ITT (mITT) because a very small number of participants (2 in study P027 and 3 in study 
P030) were randomised to double-blind treatment but were not treated.  
Analysis of the primary endpoint  
Cough monitoring was conducted for baseline and 24 hours after administering the study intervention 
on Weeks 4, 8, and 12 and Week 24 (P030). The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was 24-hour 
coughs per hour at Week 12 (P027) or at Week 24 (P030). As the change from baseline in 24-hour 
coughs per hour was expected to have a skewed and wide distribution, the data were log-transformed 
before analysis for the primary approach. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was on the 
natural log scale of the cough rate data. The variable of change from baseline in log-transformed 24-
hour coughs per hour was used to analyse the primary endpoint. A negative result indicates a decrease 
in cough rate, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough rate. 
The primary analysis approach was conducted using the longitudinal ANCOVA model. In this model, the 
response vector consists of the change from baseline in log-transformed 24-hour coughs per hour at 
each post-Baseline visit. The model includes factors for the treatment group, visit, the interaction of 
treatment group by visit, gender, and region, and the log-transformed baseline value and the 
interaction of log-transformed baseline value by the visit as covariates. The model uses all available 
24-hour coughs per hour data at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Contrasts are constructed to 
compare each of the 2 MK-7264 treatment groups to the placebo group at each post-Baseline visit. The 
least-squares mean change from baseline (in log scale) with the associated standard errors are 
displayed for each treatment group. Estimated treatment differences (MK-7264 − placebo) along with 
corresponding 95% CIs are presented for each MK-7264 treatment group. In addition, the geometric 
mean of the 24-hour coughs per hour will be presented by the treatment group and by visit. The 
percent difference in the change from baseline between MK-7264 and placebo will be estimated by 
100*(diff − 1), where diff is the difference provided by the analysis of the log-transformed variable.

EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 67/153 
 
 
 
Observation of zero coughs per hour will be replaced by a cough rate of 0.1/hour to calculate 
geometric means. If this rule is used, the table will have a footnote detailing the participant(s) and 
treatment group(s) who had zero coughs observations per hour. 
Data Handling Rules for Cough Data: In general, each 24-hour session starts with awake status and is 
composed of an awake monitoring period and a sleep monitoring period. If a participant did not have a 
sleep time available before the end of the recording session, it would be considered that the participant 
was awake during the entire session. The last monitoring period of a session will be censored after the 
end time of the session. The cough data will contain all cough events occurring during that 24-hour 
monitoring period, as well as the information about “sleep time” and “awake time”. Any session with a 
duration of recording <20 hours was to be considered missing. If a session had a duration of less than 
24 hours but not less than 20 hours, the 24-hour coughs per hour was to be based on the actual 
duration of the session. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using a similar longitudinal ANCOVA model 
as used for the primary efficacy analysis. Responder endpoints were analysed by the logistic regression 
model. The logistic regression model included terms for treatment group, visit, the interaction of 
treatment group by visit, gender, region, baseline, and baseline interaction by visit for the underlying 
continuous response.  
Subgroup analyses 
Analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be provided for the following subgroups of baseline 
factors: 
•  Gender (Male, Female) 
•  Region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Others) 
•  Age group (<60 years, ≥60 years old) 
•  Duration of cough (in years) (<10 years, ≥10 years) 
•  Baseline Cough Severity VAS (<60 mm, ≥60 mm) 
•  Baseline 24-hour coughs per hour (<20 coughs/hr, ≥20 coughs/hr) 
An additional subgroup analysis for primary diagnosis (Refractory chronic cough, Unexplained chronic 
cough) was included in the supplementary SAP. At request of the CHMP, a post hoc post randomisation 
subgroup was defined with or without taste disorders. A similar longitudinal ANCOVA model as the 
primary efficacy endpoint was be performed. For each subgroup, summary statistics including mean, 
SD, and 95% CIs will be provided each treatment group. 
Handling of Missing Data (P027 and P030) 
Missing Data Sensitivity Analyses 
The statistical approach used for the primary analysis assumes that data are missing at random (MAR). 
In this study, it was expected that missing at random and missing completely at random (MAR/MCAR) 
mechanisms will underlie most of the missingness, and the proportion of data missing not at random 
(MNAR),  driven  solely  by  unobserved  values  of 
the  study  endpoints,  will  be  small.  
In  addition  to  the  analysis  approach  specified  in  the  above-mentioned  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
analysis section, the following sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of the primary 
analysis to deviation from the missing-at-random assumption: 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1

Jump-to-reference (J2R) Multiple-imputation Analysis: J2R imputation falls under the category of 
pattern mixture models known as reference-based imputation (RBI). The RBI approach uses different 
imputation models for missing data in different treatment groups. In J2R, missing data in the control 
group are imputed under the MAR assumption, while missing data in the treatment groups are imputed 
under a MNAR assumption using the control group profile for time points after withdrawal. 
Tipping-point Multiple-imputation Analysis: In a tipping-point analysis, missing data were first imputed 
for all visits under the MAR assumption, and then the worsening/shift is applied to the imputed values 
in the active arms. To reflect the worse performance after early withdrawal, this delta-shift 
(worsening) is increased until the result is no longer statistically significant. The scientific plausibility of 
the tipping region was evaluated. 
On-treatment Subset Analysis: In this analysis, cough sessions collected after a participant has 
discontinued treatment are excluded. 
Supplemental Estimand 
For the supplemental estimand the following strategies to handling intercurrent events were outlined: 
• 
• 
Treatment discontinuation was handled by the hypothetical strategy as if the treatment 
discontinuation did not occur. So, measurements taken after treatment discontinuation were 
not used. 
The treatment policy strategy handled the usage of prohibited medication. Data were collected 
and used as normal during the usage of prohibited medication. 
•  Other attributes were identical to those in the primary estimand. 
•  An “on-treatment sensitivity analysis” was conducted for this supplemental estimand. 
Additional analyses (CHMP requested) 
The following analyses were requested for the original data set to enable the inclusion of the mITT 
population in the analysis: 
For both Studies P027 and P030, the applicant was requested to plan and perform additional analyses 
that best target the treatment policy estimand. These additional analyses should include all patients 
from the mITT population (it is recommended that a valid imputation approach be used to account for 
the missing baseline measurements, and it is reasonable to assume that these are MAR). In response 
to this request, the applicant provided results from a constrained longitudinal analysis. This analysis 
was deemed to be equivalent to using multiple imputation followed by an ANCOVA (MI+ANCOVA), 
which was also requested. For the MI + ANCOVA approach missing baseline data were imputed using a 
single imputation strategy (independent of treatment) and then for post-baseline missing data, a 
multiple imputation procedure (m = 50 imputations) was specified with treatment, region, gender, and 
all visits as covariates.  
As a sensitivity analysis, it was also requested that the applicant explores the possibility of applying 
the J2R method where the reference group is the set of participants from the same treatment arm who 
have discontinued treatment and continued to provide follow up data in the study. If this was not 
feasible given the small numbers, then it was suggested that the option of using a pooled reference 
group be explored (i.e., grouping eligible continuing participants across all treatment arms or from 
both Phase III studies).  
Re-analysis of the current sensitivity analyses (i.e., with placebo as reference) that includes all patients 
from the mITT population was also requested. The applicant was also requested to re-perform the 
supplemental analyses that target the hypothetical estimand strategy and includes all patients from

the mITT population. In order to strengthen the plausibility of the MAR assumption, the inclusion of 
additional auxiliary variables in the imputation model was encouraged.  
Interim Efficacy Analysis 
One planned interim efficacy analysis was to be conducted for futility when approximately 40% of 
participants had either completed or discontinued before completing the main study period. The futility 
analysis was to be based on the primary endpoint of 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12. The criteria 
adopted for the futility rule was based on the conditional power (CP), which is the conditional 
probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given the observed data at the time of the interim analysis. 
When the CP at the interim analysis is low, it is unlikely that the predefined primary objective will be 
achieved. The decision criteria were: If CP <20% for both treatment arms (which translates to an 
approximate 10% reduction in 24-hour coughs per hour, or less, assuming observed variability is 
similar to what was assumed based on the Protocol 012 data), strong consideration should be given to 
stopping the study for futility. Otherwise, the study will continue with both doses of MK-7264. 
Considerations for Multiple Comparison Adjustments (P027 and P030) 
Due to the interim analysis for futility, an 
-spending of 0.0001 was applied to the 2-sided Type I error 
rate of 0.05 for the primary and secondary hypotheses based on the Haybittle-Peto method. 
𝛼𝛼
Multiplicity adjustment was be made for testing two doses on the primary and the key secondary 
endpoints for the analysis 
Study P027 
• H11: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo in reducing 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 
•H12: MK-7264 15 mg BID is superior to placebo in reducing 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 
•H21: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo in reducing awake coughs per hour at Week 12 
•H31: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo on the proportion of participants with a ≥30% 
reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 
•H22: MK-7264 15 mg BID is superior to placebo in reducing awake coughs per hour at Week 12 
•H32: MK-7264 15 mg BID is superior to placebo with respect to the proportion of participants with a 
≥30% reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12. 
Study P030: The multiplicity adjustment criterion was updated based on the available information 
prior to the database lock of P030. Testing of hypotheses will be performed as follows: 
•H11: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo in reducing 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 24. 
•H21: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo in reducing awake coughs per hour at Week 24. 
•H31: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo on the proportion of participants with a ≥1.3-point 
increase from baseline in LCQ total score at Week 24. 
•H41: MK-7264 45 mg BID is superior to placebo with respect to the proportion of participants with a 
≥30% reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 24. 
To strongly control the Type-I error rate for this family, a step-down testing procedure will be applied 
in the order specified above. Each hypothesis will be formally tested only if the preceding one is 
significant at p = 0.0499 level.

Results  
Study MK7264-027 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 1073 participants were screened, and 732 were randomised across 156 global study sites. All 
nonrandomised participants were screen failures, with a non-eligible Cough Severity VAS score being 
the most common reason for screen failure. Two screen failure participants (1 in the placebo group, 1 
in the gefapixant 45 mg group) were randomised in error and did not receive study intervention. 
Excluding the 2 participants randomised in error, all randomised participants received at least 1 dose 
of the study intervention. Most participants (79.6%) completed the study, and 517 (70.8%) completed 
the study intervention regimen. 
Main study period (i.e., up till week 12): The number of patients that discontinued treatment in the 
main study part was higher in gefapixant 45 mg (61/244 (25.1 %) compared with the other two 
groups (28/244 (11.5 %) for the gefapixant 15 mg group and 30/243 (12.3%) for the placebo group. 
The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were AEs (n=55 (7.5%) total study 
population) and withdrawal by subject (n=62 (8.2%) total population). More patients in the gefapixant 
45 mg group n=40(16.5%) discontinued due to an AE, than in the other treatment groups (gefapixant 
15 mg n=8 (3.3%), placebo n=7 (2.95%) most discontinuations were due to taste-related AEs. Other 
reasons for discontinuation of study intervention were similar across groups and discontinuation 
categories.  
Overall trial period (i.e. main period + extension period): At the end of the trial, a total of 96/243 
(39.5 %) of the gefapixant 45 mg group, 57/244 (23.4%) of the gefapixant 15 mg group and 60/241 
(24.1 %) of the placebo group discontinued the trial (Figure 13).

•  Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 156 sites in: USA, Argentina, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Hungary, Israel, Poland, Japan, Peru, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, and Ukraine. The study 
period was from 14 March 2018 (first participant first visit) up to 24 April 2019 (last participant last 
visit). The date of the CSR was 01 Dec 2020. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Study 027 included 3 amendments. The first amendment was made before the inclusion was started 
(13 Dec 2017). The second amendment more specifically described that patients should receive 
appropriate treatment for at least 2 months before enrolment. The amendment also allowed the 
inclusion of patients with a lower GFR (17 Sept 2018). The last amendment (26 April 2019) was 
restricted to a few countries (UK, USA Ukraine, DE, PL). The amendment described that the extension

follows up period was followed by a 3 month off treatment follow-up up period to explore the impact of 
withdraw in MK 7264 therapy in a participant who has been treated for 1 year. 
•  Baseline data 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced across intervention 
groups; the mean number of coughs per hour over 24 hours at baseline was slightly higher in the 
placebo group mean (SD) 38.7 (79.4) cough /hour than the gefapixant groups mean (SD): 26.8 (21.2) 
and 28.5 (3.7) coughs/h. Most participants were female (74%), white (78%), and had a long duration 
of chronic cough (≥ 10 years (46%); the mean age of participants was 59.0 years. Overall, more 
participants had a primary diagnosis of RCC (59%) than UCC (41%); the primary diagnosis was 
balanced across intervention groups. The reported medical history conditions were generally balanced 
across intervention groups. Participants who were classified as having RCC had a comorbid condition 
that may have been associated with chronic cough. The most frequently reported comorbidities were 
asthma (40.7%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (40.5%), and rhinitis allergic (19.7%). Other 
frequently reported comorbid conditions known to be associated with chronic cough included seasonal 
allergy (8.8%), upper airway cough syndrome (6.8%), rhinitis (5.1%), chronic gastritis (3.2%), and 
dyspepsia (1.8%). Compliance with the study intervention regimen was high across the intervention 
groups, with 95.1% of participants being >80% compliant.  
•  Numbers analysed 
The following analyses sets are defined: 
Efficacy analyses  
Full analyses set (FAS): defined by the applicant as all randomised participants who have taken at 
least 1 dose of the study intervention and provided a baseline measurement and at least 1 post-
baseline measurement (i.e., a 24 h cough registration) during the treatment period (Table 11). 
(Modified) ITT population: All participants who were randomised and who have taken at least 1 
dose of the study intervention. Also referred to as the ‘Treated’ population in some tables.  
Please refer to Table 13 for numbers included in the analyses related to cough counts.  
Per protocol (PP) PP: population excludes participants due to important deviations from the protocol 
that may substantially affect the results of the primary efficacy endpoint. Potential deviations that may 
result in the exclusion of a participant from the PP population will be specified in the sSAP. 
Safety analysis: All Participants as Treated (APaT) population which consists of all randomised 
participants who received at least one dose of study.

Study MK7264-030 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 2,004 participants were screened; 1,317 participants were randomised across 158 global 
study sites in 20 countries. All nonrandomised participants were screen failures, with a non-eligible 
Cough Severity VAS score being the most common reason for screen failures. Three screen failure 
participants were randomised in error and did not receive study intervention. Excluding the 3 
participants randomised in error, all randomised participants received at least 1 dose of the study 
intervention. Most participants (83.9%) completed the study, and 960 (73.1%) completed the study 
intervention regimen.  
Main study period (i.e., up till week 24): The proportion of participants who discontinued treatment in 
the main study was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group (125/439 (28.5%) than in the gefapixant 15 
mg (82/440 (18.6%) and placebo group (66/435 (15.2%). The most common reasons for treatment 
discontinuation were AEs (n=164 (12.5%) total study population P030) and withdrawal by subject 
(n=157 (11.9%) total population P030). More patients in the gefapixant 45 mg group (n= 88 (20%) 
discontinued treatment compared with the other treatment groups gefapixant 15 mg (n 34 7.7% and 
placebo (n=21 (4.8%) respectively); most discontinuations were due to taste-related AEs. Other 
reasons for discontinuation of study intervention were similar across groups and discontinuation

•  Conduct of the study 
Study P030 had the same amendments as mentioned in study P027 (dated 13 Dec 2017, 18 Sept 2018 
and 26 April 2019) and two additional amendments that were restricted to China in order to achieve 
the locally required sample size, while the low dose group was removed from the follow up extension. 
•  Baseline data 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced across intervention 
groups, including baseline smoking status. Most participants were female (75%), white (80%) and had 
a long duration of chronic cough (≥ 10 years) (44%); the mean age of participants was 58.1 years. 
Overall, more participants had a primary diagnosis of RCC (63%) than UCC (37%); the primary 
diagnosis was balanced across intervention groups. The reported medical history conditions were 
generally balanced across intervention groups. Participants who were classified as having RCC had a 
comorbid condition that may have been associated with chronic cough. As such, gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (40.3%), asthma (40.2%), and rhinitis allergic (14.5%) were among the most 
frequently reported medical history conditions. Other reported comorbid conditions known to be 
associated with chronic cough included seasonal allergy (10.8%), rhinitis (5.9%), upper-airway cough 
syndrome (5.6%), chronic gastritis (4.5%), and dyspepsia (2.8%). Compliance with the study 
intervention regimen was high across the intervention groups, with approximately 95% of participants 
being >80%.  
•  Numbers analysed 
Analysis sets for the ITT, mITT, FAS and PP populations have a similar definition as in study P027. With 
regard to the numbers analysed at week 4, 8, 12, and 24 the numbers are as depicted in (Table 14,

•  Outcomes and estimation  
A series of analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints were conducted in both studies.  
The results from all these analyses are provided in this document in the following order:  
I. 
Original data set: Analyses based on the full analysis set (FAS) as defined by the applicant 
and using the longitudinal analysis of covariance model for continuous outcomes. This is 
Assessment report

the pre-specified analysis in the protocol and the results were reported as primary in the 
CSR.  
II. 
Original data set: Based on the mITT population, analysed according to the 
multiple imputation + ANCOVA for continuous outcomes. For binary endpoints 
derived from continuous outcomes, a multiple imputation approach was used 
followed by the relevant analysis.  
This method is preferred by the CHMP as this analysis does not exclude patients who had 
missing baseline or missing post baseline data. Therefore, this analysis is considered to 
more closely estimate the treatment effect of the treatment policy estimand.  
III. 
Recount data set: The recount data set includes cough count data that are based only on 
version 3.0 of the compression algorithm, which was used in the additional validation 
studies. The analysis method is the same as is specified in I, using the FAS.  
IV. 
Recount data set: As specified in II, using the mITT population. It is noted that there may 
be some numerical differences for some analyses like the PRO outcomes, that are not 
affected by the recount of the coughs. This is because the multiple imputation procedure 
was re-run for the recount data. For completeness, the provided results have also been 
presented.  
To ensure transparency, the full set of results are presented for the primary endpoint and the LCQ 
responder rate in Study P030, which are both included in the SmPC. For the other endpoints, only the 
results based on the original dataset and including the mITT population are presented (i.e., data set 
II). 
Study MK-7264-027 
Primary endpoint – 24-Hour Coughs per Hour at week 12 (study P027) 
I. 
Original data: FAS, longitudinal ANCOVA model 
At baseline, the geometric mean of the number of coughs per hour over a 24 h period was 18.24 for 
the 45 mg dose, 19.86 for the 15 mg dose and 22.83 for placebo. At week 12, the model based 
geometric mean ratio (95%) was 0.38 (0.33, 0.44) for the 45 mg group, 0.48 (0.41, 0.55) for the 15 
mg group and 0.47 (0.41, 0.54) for placebo. (Table 16), indicating a within treatment improvement of 
62%, 53% and 53% respectively. 
At Week 12, the number of coughs per hour over a 24-hour period were significantly reduced in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group compared with the placebo group (p=0.041), with an estimated relative 
reduction of the geometric mean ratio was -18.45% (-32.92, -0.86). The number of coughs per hour 
over 24 hours was not significantly reduced in the gefapixant 15 mg group (1.56 (-16.13, 22.99); 
p=0.874) (Table 16 , Figure 15). 
The within-group reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12 in the gefapixant  
45 mg group in Study P027 was consistent with the treatment benefit observed in Study P012 (around 
60%). However, study P027 showed a smaller placebo-corrected reduction in 24-hour coughs per hour 
at Week 12 than that observed in the Phase 2b Study P012. 
The placebo response observed at Week 4 was similar to that observed in Study P012 at Week 4; 
however, in Study P027, the placebo response continued to increase in magnitude over time.

 Original data: mITT, Multiple Imputation (MI) + ANCOVA 
Table 17 presents results from the MI+ANCOVA analysis including the mITT population. 
At week 12, the model-based geometric mean ratio (95%) was 0.39 (0.34, 0.45) for the 45 mg group, 
and 0.48 (0.42, 0.55) for placebo. The estimated relative reduction was between gefapixant 45 mg 
and placebo -18.52% (95% CI: -32.76, -1.28) (Table 17). Results from the constrained longitudinal 
analysis also performed by the applicant were -19.05% (-33.09, -2.06), p = 0.030.

Table 17 Analysis of 24-hour coughs per hour at week 12, (mITT, MI + ANCOVA) 
Sensitivity analyses provided in the CSR  
Sensitivity analyses were performed using a jump-to-reference approach, using placebo arm as the 
reference group as well as a tipping-point analysis.  
For the jump-to-reference multiple imputation analysis the estimated relative reduction for the 45mg 
group compared with placebo was -16.36 (95% CI: -31.96, 2.82) and for the jump-to-reference via 
pattern mixture approach the relative reduction was -16.67 (95% CI: -30.01, -0.78). The tipping point 
analysis showed that the point where the primary comparison of the 45 mg group versus placebo was 
no longer statistically significant, occurred between 6% and 7% of worsening applied to the missing 
data imputation in the 45mg group.  
The Clinical Study Report also describes a supplemental estimand strategy. In this supplemental 
strategy, a hypothetical estimand strategy is applied for treatment discontinuations (i.e., any data 
after treatment discontinuation are set to missing, and only available on-treatment data are included in 
the analysis. The table below presents the results from this approach. The estimated relative reduction 
for the 45mg group compared with placebo was -21.92% (95% CI: -36.11, -4.58). In the PP analyses, 
the Estimated Relative Reduction (%) MK-7264 45 mg vs. Placebo from baseline to week 12 was not 
statistically significant (-17.56 (95% CI -33.18, 1.72, p=0.072)). 
Table 18 On-treatment subset analysis, Study P027 
Additional sensitivity analyses requested by the CHMP 
In line with the request for the analyses to include the mITT population and to target the treatment 
policy estimand, additional sensitivity analyses were requested. These included a jump to reference 
with off-treatment as reference group for imputation, and a jump to reference with the placebo group 
as the reference group. For the jump to reference with off-treatment as reference group the estimated 
relative reduction was estimated to be -19.80% (-33.69, -3.00), p = 0.023. For the jump to reference 
with placebo as the reference group this was -17.34% (-32.80, 1.67) p = 0.071.

Additional analyses were also requested to target the secondary estimand strategy – the hypothetical 
estimand. This included an MI+ ANCOVA approach including the mITT population; estimated relative 
reduction: -20.45% (-35.16, -2.42), p = 0.028 and a jump to reference with placebo as reference; 
estimated relative reduction: -18.35% (-33.93, 0.90) p = 0.060. 
III. 
Recount data: FAS, longitudinal ANCOVA model 
The analysis of recount efficacy data was performed for the primary endpoint of 24-hour cough rate 
using the longitudinal analysis of covariance model adjusted for covariates of treatment, visit, the 
interaction of treatment by visit, gender, region, log-transformed baseline value, and interaction of 
log-transformed baseline value by visit. An unstructured covariance matrix, as well simpler covariance 
structures of Toeplitz, compound symmetry, first-order autoregressive in the model were used to 
model the correlation among repeated measurements to examine the consistency of results across 
different covariance matrix assumptions. Full results are presented in Table 19. 
Geometric means at baseline and Week 12 were slightly higher than original geometric means in each 
treatment group, but the geometric mean ratio remained the same. Using the unstructured covariance 
matrix in the model, for the primary endpoint of 24-hour cough rates, the relative difference over 
placebo was -16.96% (95% CI -31.34, 0.59) p=0.057.

•  Secondary endpoints1 
In Study P027, the prespecified step-down procedure for multiplicity adjustment precluded statistical 
testing for the secondary endpoints at either dose, given the observed lack of efficacy on the primary 
endpoint for the gefapixant 15 mg BID dose. The following descriptive endpoints were observed. 
Awake coughs per hour at week 12 
II. Original data: mITT, MI + ANCOVA  
At Week 12, the gefapixant 45 mg group had a significant reduction in awake coughs per hour 
compared with the placebo group, resulting in estimated relative reduction of -18.33 % (95% CI (-
 32.62, -0.96), p=0.04 (

Primary endpoint – 24-Hour Coughs per Hour at week 24 
I. 
Original data: FAS, longitudinal ANCOVA model 
At baseline, the geometric mean of the number of coughs per hour over a 24 h period was 18.55 for 
the 45 mg dose, 19.35 for the 15 mg dose and 19.48 for placebo. At week 24, the model-based 
geometric mean ratio (95%) was 0.37 (0.33, 0.41) for the 45 mg group, 0.43 (0.38, 0.47) for the 15

mg group and 0.43 (0.39, 0.48) for placebo, indicating a within treatment improvement of 63 %, 57% 
and 57% respectively. 
At Week 24, the number of coughs per hour over a 24-hour period was significantly reduced in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group compared with the placebo group (p=0.031), with an estimated relative 
reduction of the geometric mean ratio -14.64% (-26.07, -1.43) (Table 25). The number of coughs per 
hour over 24 hours was not significantly reduced in the gefapixant 15 mg group (-1.14 (-14.27, 
14.02); p=0.875). 
Like in study P027, the placebo response observed at Week 4 was similar to that observed in Study 
P012 at Week 4; however, in Study P030, it continued to increase in magnitude over time. The 
magnitude of the observed placebo response was similar in Studies P030 and P027. The within-group 
reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 24 in the gefapixant 45 mg group in 
Study P030 was consistent with the treatment benefit observed in Study P012. 
Overall, the placebo-corrected reduction in 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 24 was smaller than that 
observed in Phase 2b Study P012 at Week 12.

Sensitivity analyses  
Sensitivity analyses were performed using a jump-to-reference approach, using placebo arm as the 
reference group as well as a tipping-point analysis. For the jump-to-reference multiple imputation 
analysis, the estimated relative reduction for the 45mg group compared with placebo was -12.55 (95% 
CI: -24.44, 1.23), and for the jump-to-reference via pattern mixture approach, the relative reduction 
was -12.56 (95% CI: -22.61, -1.21). The tipping point analysis showed that the point where the 
primary comparison of the 45 mg group versus placebo was no longer statistically significant occurred 
between 6% and 7% of worsening applied to the missing data imputation in the 45mg group.  
The CSR also describes a supplemental estimand strategy. In this supplemental strategy, a 
hypothetical estimand strategy is applied for treatment discontinuations (i.e., any data after treatment 
discontinuation are set to missing, and only available on-treatment data are included in the analysis 
(Table 27) presents the results from this approach. The estimated relative reduction for the 45mg 
group compared with placebo was -15.75% (95% -27.43, -2.19). 
Table 27 On-treatment subset analysis, Study P030 
In the PP analyses, the Estimated Relative Reduction (%) MK-7264 45 mg vs. Placebo result was -
16.39 (95% CI -27.96, -2.95, p=0.019). 
Additional sensitivity analyses requested by the CHMP 
In line with the request for the analyses to include the mITT population and to target the treatment 
policy estimand, additional sensitivity analyses were requested. These included a jump to reference 
with off-treatment as reference group for imputation, and a jump to reference with the placebo group 
as the reference group.

For the jump to reference with off-treatment as reference group the estimated relative reduction was 
estimated to be -13.78% (-25.40, -0.34), p = 0.045. For the jump to reference with placebo as the 
reference group this was -13.00% (-25.20, 1.19), p = 0.071. 
Additional analyses were also requested to target the secondary estimand strategy – the hypothetical 
estimand. This included an MI_+ ANCOVA approach including the mITT population; estimated relative 
reduction: -12.73% (-24.74, 1.19), p = 0.071 and a jump to reference with placebo as reference; 
estimated relative reduction: -12.20% (-25.42, 3.36), p = 0.118. 
III 
Recount data: FAS, longitudinal ANCOVA 
At baseline the geometric mean of the number of coughs per hour over a 24 h period was 19.38 for the 
45 mg dose, 20.23 for the 15 mg dose and 20.39 for placebo. At week 24, the model based geometric 
mean ratio (95%) was 0.37 (0.33, 0.41) for the 45 mg group, 0.42 (0.38, 0.47) for the 15 mg group 
and 0.43 (0.39, 0.48) for placebo., indicating a within treatment improvement of 63%, 58% and 57% 
respectively.  
At Week 24, the number of coughs per hour over a 24-hour period were significantly reduced in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group compared with the placebo group p= 0.031, with an estimated relative 
reduction of the geometric mean ratio was -14.63 (-25.98, -1.53), p=0.030 (Table 28). The number of 
coughs per hour over 24 hours was not significantly reduced in the gefapixant 15 mg group 2.71 %  
(-15.55, 12.08, p=0.70).

In Study P030, the prespecified step-down procedure for multiplicity adjustment was formally stopped 
at the fourth step at which the results for the ≥ 30% reduction in cough rate for 45mg vs placebo were 
not statistically significant. Other endpoints lower in the hierarchy are considered to be descriptive.  
Awake coughs per hour 
II Original data: mITT MI + ANCOVA 
At Week 24, the gefapixant 45 mg group had a significant reduction in awake coughs per hour 
compared with the placebo group, resulting in an estimated relative reduction of -14.31 % (95% CI 
[-25.95, -0.84], p=0.038). The gefapixant 15 mg BID group showed a small numerical improvement 
over placebo concerning reducing the number of awake coughs per hour at Week 24, with an 
estimated relative reduction of -1.21%, 95% CI [-14.14, 138]) (Table 31).

Missing baseline values were imputed based on gender and region, followed by multiple imputation of the 
missing data (m = 50 imputed datasets) for all follow-up visits using study, treatment arm gender, 
region and the other follow-up visits as covariates. Following imputation, ANCOVA model is conducted at 
the time point of interest, adjusting for covariates of study, treatment, baseline, region, and gender. 
Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ)  
I. Original data: FAS  
At baseline, the mean (SD) LCQ total score was 104 (3.1) for the 45 mg dose, 10.4 (2.9) for the 15 
mg dose and 10.4 (3.0) for placebo. At week 24, the mean (SD) score was 14.8 (3.9), 14.3 (4.1) and 
13.9 (4.0) respectively.  
At week 24, the proportion of participants with a ≥1.3-point increase from baseline in LCQ total score 
was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg (76.6%) and 15 mg groups (75%) than in the placebo group 
(69.0%); only the gefapixant 45 mg group showed a significant (p=0.040) improvement in cough-
specific HRQoL at Week 24 (Table 32).

based on the logistic regression model. The covariates include treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, 
gender, region, baseline continuous variable, and the interaction of baseline continuous variable by visit. 
When the patients with missing data were included as non-responders (Miettinen and Nurminen 
Method), the number of responders and the differences became smaller: gefapixant 45 mg (62.5%), 
15 mg (63.3%) and placebo 59%. The estimated difference between the 45 mg and placebo was 3.3 
% (95% CI - 3. 27, 9.94).

At Week 52, the observed proportion of participants with a ≥1.3-point increase from baseline in LCQ 
total scores was higher in both gefapixant groups than the placebo group, 45 mg group (82.9%), 15 
mg group (79.1%) and placebo 68.6%). The estimated difference with placebo was 13.30 % (95% CI 
is not provided). When the patients with missing data were included as non-responders, the number of 
responders and the differences became smaller: gefapixant 45 mg (63.7%), 15 mg (62.6%) and 
placebo (55.2%). The estimated difference between the 45 mg and placebo was 8.4 % (95% CI 1.81, 
15.02%). In the PP analyses, the 45 mg dose showed an estimated relative difference with placebo 
from baseline to week 24 of 7.7 % (95% CI 0.66, 14.72).  
Summaries of LCQ individual domain scores (physical, psychological, and social) over time indicate 
that scores from each of the individual domains contributed equally to the LCQ total score.

2.5.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
In clinical studies, patients aged ≥ 65 years might be underrepresented. Table 35 provides an 
overview of the number of elderly patients included in the clinical trials. The data show that overall, a 
total of n=1002 (28%) of included study patients were aged ≥ 65 years.

2.5.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data from Studies P027 and P030 were considered acceptable to pool because the studies had identical 
entry criteria, dosing regimens, and efficacy endpoints. Participants were pooled across studies by their 
treatment group at randomisation.  
Efficacy analyses of objective cough endpoints and subgroup analyses are provided for Week 12, the 
timepoint up to which the cough data were available from both studies (see results below).  
After week 24, only PRO data was collected. Overall, these PRO showed improved outcomes over 
placebo which was maintained over time.  
Pooled Primary endpoint- 24 h coughs/h at week 12

Original data: mITT, MI+ANCOVA 
At week 12, the pooled analyses showed that the estimated relative reduction in cough rate compared 
with placebo was -1.87% (95% CI -12.01, 9.43) for the 15 mg dose and -18.27% 95% CI (-27.20, -
9.24) for the 45 mg dose (Table 36).

Original data: mITT, MI + ANCOVA 
The pooled data for the subgroup analyses showed overall a consistent reduction in the number of 24 h 
cough/h over the predefined subgroups (Table 38). The subgroup with a baseline cough count ≥ 20 
coughs /h showed a numerically larger improvement than the complementary group with a baseline 
cough count < 20 cough/h. The post-hoc post-randomisation subgroup without taste disorders showed 
no numerical improvement.

2.5.5.6.  Supportive studies 
After careful consideration of the advice provided by the MWP, the information submitted in the 
validation studies, and in the context of the results, the CHMP concluded that the original data should 
remain as the primary data set for the discussion on benefit/risk and reporting of the treatment effect 
in the SmPC. 
Recount data set: After the validation exercise, the applicant provided the results of the recount data 
set. The recount data may affect the primary, cough related outcome and other cough related 
outcomes. The subgroup that would be most affected by the recount of the data was the subgroup 
according baseline cough count (<20 cough/h vs ≥ 20 cough/h) because also the baseline grouping of 
the subjects might be impacted. Table 40 shows the comparison of the main baseline and efficacy data 
of the recount data set and the original data set. Upon recount of the data, the subgroup of patients 
with baseline cough count ≥ 20 cough/h included n=20 more patients. 
The comparison of the primary, secondary and subgroup analyses according baseline cough show 
generally comparable results between the original and recount data set. Comparable results were also 
seen in the subgroup analyses, including the subgroup analyses according baseline cough count (Table 
40).

Off -treatment durability study: The off-treatment durability Study was a multicentre, 12-week, 
noninterventional, observational study conducted at select sites and countries. A total of 163 
participants enrolled in the Off-treatment Durability Study; 41 participants enrolled from Study P027-
03 and 122 participants enrolled from Study P030-04. Of the participants enrolled, all but 2 
participants completed the study. Although participants were no longer receiving study intervention, 
previous treatment assignments remained blinded. To analyse the exploratory efficacy objectives, 
participants completed various PRO measures including the Cough Severity VAS, LCQ and CSD. 
Efficacy results: After 52 weeks of treatment and through the 12-week off-treatment period (Week 
64), the above PROs were relatively stable and did not return to baseline (Week0): mean weekly 
Cough Severity VAS score, mean LCQ total score, and mean weekly CSD total score. Across the 
gefapixant and placebo groups, most participants who achieved an on-treatment response at Week 52 
were also responders at the end of the 12-week off- treatment period (Week 64) as measured by: 
Cough Severity VAS score (82% overall), LCQ total score (85% overall), CSD total score with ≥1.3-
point reduction from baseline (87% overall), and CSD total score with ≥2.7-point reduction from 
baseline (79% overall). Across the gefapixant and placebo groups, most participants who achieved a n 
on-treatment response at Week 52 had a durable off-treatment response over the 12-week off-
treatment period (Week 64) as measured by: Cough Severity VAS score, LCQ total score, and CSD 
total score. For those who lost response, timing to loss of response trended similarly across the 
gefapixant and placebo groups through the 12-week off- treatment period. 
Phase 3 study P042 and P043: Additional supportive top-line results of two, randomised, blinded, 
placebo-controlled phase 3 studies of 12-week duration were provided (study P042 and study P043).  
Study P042 was conducted in patients with stress induced urine incontinence. At week 12, gefapixant 
45 mg showed a statistically significant reduction in cough induced stress induced episodes measures 
as the percentage change from baseline (estimated difference -11.67 % (95% CI -19.67, -3.67), 
p=0.004.

Study P043 was conducted in patients with recent onset chronic refractory or unexplained cough 
chronic cough (RCC or UCC) of < 1-year duration. At week 12, gefapixant 45 mg in improved the mean 
change in LCQ total score, with a statistically significant treatment difference of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.06, 
1.44; p=0.034). 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for gefapixant was supported by two pivotal Phase 3 studies P027 and P030. Additional 
evidence was provided from the phase 2 study P012 and the top-line results from the phase 3 studies 
P042 and P043. The two pivotal phase 3 studies were international randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, 12-month studies with near-identical designs, i.e., study MK7264-P027 (P027) and study 
MK7264-P03 (P030). These studies had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, and dosing regimens 
(placebo bid, gefapixant 15 mg bid and gefapixant 45 mg bid) and collected the same primary and 
secondary endpoints. The study included patients with chronic cough for 1 years a diagnosed as RCC 
or UCC as defined by the ACCP guidelines.  
The differences in trial design between the two trials P027 and P030 refer to the duration of the main 
study period of collection of the main efficacy outcomes (P027: 12 weeks and P030: 24 weeks), and 
the hierarchical testing. Only Study P030 included a patient-reported outcome i.e., LCQ responder rate 
in the hierarchical testing, and will provide the main support for the clinical relevance by a patient-
derived outcome. In a limited number of countries, the study was extended with a 3-month off 
treatment period durability period to explore the impact of withdrawing therapy in patients who had 
been treated for 1 year. Only high-level data is provided from this study during assessment.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the phase 3 studies are almost identical to the phase 2 studies 
and are considered acceptable to include a heterogenous chronic cough population. Upon inclusion, 
patients had to be symptomatic as defined by a cough severity VAS score of ≥ 40 mm. All patients had 
to have a diagnosis of chronic cough defined as RCC or UCC as defined by the ERS guideline and 
confirmed by the principal investigator or sub-investigator. All investigators were trained on the ACCP 
guidelines before the start of the Phase 3 programme as well as during subsequent trainings throughout 
the Phase 3 programme. All exclusion criteria were appropriate for including a broad chronic cough 
population. Patients with significant, modifiable risk factors such as smoking and taking ACE-inhibitors 
were excluded, in line with current guidelines.  
During the study, patients were treated in a blinded manner with gefapixant 45 mg bid, gefapixant 15 
mg  bid  or  placebo.  The  use  of  the  placebo  comparison  arm  is  acceptable  because  no  generalised 
authorised  substance  exists  for  chronic  cough  in  Europe.  The  study  patients  were  stratified  according 
to  gender  and  region,  which  is  considered  adequate.  The  studies  were  not  stratified  according  to  the 
underlying disease like RCC or UCC because of the lack of evidence that this factor would influence the 
treatment outcomes. The pivotal phase 3 clinical studies did not follow the SAWP advice to include two 
co-primary  endpoints  representing  an  objective  endpoint  in  reducing  the  cough  frequency,  and  a 
subjective  PRO  endpoint.  Following  the  SAWP  advice,  study  P030  was  sufficiently  powered  to  show  a 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  a  subjective  PRO  outcome  to  support  the  clinical  relevance  of 
the findings.  
The primary endpoint was the reduction of cough frequency per hour measured over 24 hours from 
baseline until the end of the maintenance treatment (12-week study P027, 24-week study P030) 
compared with placebo. The minimally clinically important difference (MCID) for the reduction in cough 
Assessment report

Page 109/153 
 
 
 
 
frequency is not well established. On a patient level, a reduction of 30% from baseline can be 
perceived (and therefore, this 30% reduction might be considered as the MCID. A 20% (15 mg) and 
30% reduction (45 mg) from baseline had been used in the sample size calculation.  
The key secondary parameter was the number of awake coughs measured over a 24-hour period. This 
objective secondary parameter has a considerable overlap with the primary outcome. As it is not 
distinctively different, its values were limited as supportive outcome measure.  
The Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) was used as a secondary outcome in the hierarchical testing 
of study P030 to support the clinical relevance of the primary outcome. The LCQ is a validated 
questionnaire of a patient-reported outcome in the quality of life, where a ≥ 1.3 reduction is associated 
with a minimal clinically relevant improvement in QoL. A statistically significant improvement in the 
responder rate would support the clinical relevance if a reduction in the cough rate would be observed. 
Supportive outcomes included both objective and subjective parameters. Objective supportive 
measurement was the difference in responders with placebo showing a ≥ 30%, ≥ 50% or ≥70% 
reduction in cough count which would show the consistency of findings of the primary outcome when 
more stringent criteria were used. Additional supportive subjective outcome data was provided using 
the responder rate of 2 additional cough specific PRO measures i.e., the Cough Severity Dairy (CSD) 
and the Cough Severity Visual analogue scale (VAS).   
In the studies P027 and P030, various subgroups were predefined to show the consistency of efficacy. 
Except for the RCC and UCC, the subgroup analyses were not based on a well-accepted, distinct 
disease entity or clear pharmacological and /or pathophysiological rational.  
Different data sets available for the primary analyses: The new outcome measure, the relative 
reduction in cough counts measured with the VitaloJAK system initially appeared to be insufficiently 
validated. During the assessment procedure, the system was re-validated based on the use of one 
compression algorithm and around 90% of the cough recordings were re-compressed using this 
algorithm. Results based on the recount data were provided as supportive data. The recount data 
showed that the overall inferences and conclusions are consistent between the original and recount 
data, and the point estimates are largely in agreement. The results from the validation studies suggest 
that there are unlikely to be systematic biases introduced into the cough counts, also using the other 
two compression algorithms with dual channel processing. 
After careful consideration of the advice provided by the MWP (Sept 2022), the information submitted 
in the validation studies, and in the context of the results, the CHMP concluded that the original data 
should remain as the primary data set for the discussion on benefit/risk, and reporting of the 
treatment effect in the SmPC.  
Method of analyses: In the SAP, it is stated that the primary analysis approach was to be conducted 
using the longitudinal ANCOVA model. The use of a longitudinal ANCOVA model was raised as a 
potential concern in the scientific advice as it does not validly account for the missing data. It was 
instead suggested that an MMRM be fitted. Based on the SAS code provided in the supplemental SAP, 
it is understood that for the original analysis, an MMRM was fitted. As stated in the CSRs for studies 
P027 and P030, the intercurrent events of treatment discontinuation and/or use of prohibited 
medication were to be handled through a treatment policy estimand strategy, under which, outcome 
data should continue to be collected and included in the final analysis regardless of discontinuation or 
use of prohibited medication. It is agreed that a treatment policy strategy is an appropriate approach 
in this context. However, despite the goal to collect outcome data after treatment discontinuation or 
use of prohibited medicine, not all participants had data available at all timepoints. Given the initial 
observations of missing data and the importance of the potential impact on estimating the treatment 
policy estimand, the CHMP requested the electronic datasets containing the individual patient data for 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 110/153 
 
 
 
Studies 027 and 030, which the applicant provided during the assessment. An investigation of these 
data identified that less than a third of participants in both studies had “off-treatment” data available 
after discontinuing treatment. Therefore, the current approaches to handling these missing data don’t 
produce an estimate of treatment effect under the treatment policy estimand strategy.  
There are two main issues related to the current handling of missing data:  
• 
The treatment policy estimand targets the ITT analysis population. The current definition of the 
analysis population for the original analyses performed in studies P027 and P030 resulted in 
the exclusion of participants for whom the baseline, or all post-baseline measurements were 
missing. The exclusion of these participants was considered likely to result in a biased estimate 
of the treatment effect for the ITT population.  
•  Not all patients included in the analysis had data available at all timepoints, including week 12 
(in study P027) or week 24 (in study P030). More data are missing on participants in the 45mg 
treatment arm, primarily as a result of withdrawal following treatment discontinuation. 
Additional analyses were requested by the CHMP that sought to address the problem of the missing 
data in the mITT population and to better target the treatment policy estimand. These included 
additional J2R approaches, with participants who discontinued treatment but remained in follow up, 
and approaches that included all participants who received treatment regardless of the extent of their 
available data. Based on an evaluation of these approaches it was concluded that the primary results 
should be based on the constrained longitudinal analysis, or the preferred method of a multiple 
imputation + ANCOVA. Hence, the multiple imputation + ANCOVA approach would be considered the 
primary analysis method for reporting in the SmPC. The best approach to target the treatment policy 
estimand remains uncertain, however it is considered that the pre-planned J2R method, with placebo 
as the reference group is sufficiently consistent with the primary results. The results from the 
hypothetical estimand strategy (constrained longitudinal analysis and MI + ANCOVA) give an estimate 
of the treatment effect under the situation where patients continued treatment regardless of having 
experienced an adverse event, perceived lack of efficacy, or other events that led to treatment 
discontinuation.  
Based on these considerations, the B/R assessment is conducted on the original data set analysis 
methods applied that intended to include the mITT population.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal studies – P027 and P030 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics: The baseline characteristics, including smoking status, 
were generally well balanced across the intervention groups in both phase 3 studies. In both studies, 
the proportion of females recruited were higher than males (74.2% females in study P027; 74.9% 
females in study P030), which aligns with the target population. The included patient population had a 
long history of chronic cough with a median duration of 8-10 years. More patients with RCC (~60%) 
than UCC (~40%) were included in both trials.  
In study P027 (but not in P030), it was noticed that the mean baseline cough counts per hour are 
much higher in the placebo group. This is likely to be explained by patients with excessive cough 
frequency, i.e., of over 1000 coughs per hour. The median is more balanced between the groups but 
still slightly higher in the placebo group. This imbalance is accounted for in the constrained longitudinal 
analysis, or by adjustment for baseline in an ANCOVA. 
Number analysed: The initially provided dataset excluded patients with missing baseline or all missing 
post baseline data. Using the requested updated analyses, all patients in the mITT population were 
accounted for in the analyses. This approach is considered to better estimate the treatment effect for 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 111/153 
 
 
 
the treatment policy estimand as the exclusion of any patient with missing data is likely to lead to 
biased estimates of effect. 
Missing data methods were used to account for missing follow up data, with the missing data 
assumptions dependent on the method. More patients discontinued in the active treatment arms 
compared with placebo. The premature discontinuation rate was highest in the 45 mg group, the 
difference with the other treatment groups was driven by the adverse events, including taste disorder. 
Although it was intended to follow up all patients who discontinued, this was not possible. Missing data 
methods were used to account for the missing follow up data. The primary analysis assumes that the 
missing data are missing at random, conditional on the available data and thus represents a hybrid 
treatment policy and hypothetical estimand. Sensitivity analyses that were intended to better target 
the treatment policy estimand were also performed, as was an analysis that targeted the hypothetical 
estimand. This analysis only included data that were recorded when patients were on treatment.  
Efficacy results:  The two pivotal placebo-controlled trial had a large placebo effect (larger than in the 
phase 2 trial P012). The placebo effect affected both objective and subjective outcome measures, i.e., 
frequency  of  cough  registration,  as  well  as  the  patient  reported  outcomes.  Nevertheless,  the  double-
blind, randomised controlled designs made it possible to address a treatment effect on top of placebo 
(if present). The 15 mg dose did not show superiority over placebo in the primary outcome and most 
of  the  secondary  outcome  measures.  As  such,  the  efficacy  of  the  15  mg  dose  is  insufficiently  shown 
and was not further pursued. Therefore, the results for the 15 mg dose will not be further discussed to 
focus on the results of the 45 mg dose. 
Gefapixant 45 mg dose: summary of results 
Primary and secondary outcomes: In line with the two-phase II studies MK7264 -P010 and MK7264-
P012, the primary and key secondary cough related outcome measures showed consistent 
improvements favouring the gefapixant 45 mg. In both studies, the 45 mg dose demonstrated a 
superior effect over placebo in the primary efficacy outcome, i.e., a relative reduction in the number of 
coughs per 24/h (Study P027:- 18.52%; (95% CI– 32,76, -1.28) p=0.036; Study P030: -13.3% 
(95%CI -24.74, -0.10) p=0.048).  
In study P030, this primary endpoint was also supported with a statistically significant improvement in 
the number of awake coughs and the responder rate in the LCQ (absolute difference ~7.32 % (95 % 
CI not provided) p=0.024); numerical improvements for both parameters were observed in study 
P027; Study P027 was not designed to show superiority in the LCQ responder rate. Overall, these 
outcomes show a clinically relevant effect.  
Additional supportive outcomes: The objective reduction in cough rate, the primary efficacy variable, 
was supported with numerical improvements in the responder rate of patients that show a reduction in 
the baseline cough rate ≥ 30 %, at week 12 (4.91% for study P027) or and 6.32 % at week 24 (study 
P030) on top of a large placebo response. Exploratory analyses showing somewhat larger differences 
when more stringent criteria (i.e., ≥ 50% reduction, ≥ 70% reduction) were used, supporting the 
treatment effect. No data for the objective outcome measures “reduction in cough rate” could be 
provided beyond the 24-week treatment as this efficacy parameter was no longer measured. The 
observed improvements in the LCQ score were supported with numerical improvements in the other 
PRO of the responder rate favouring gefapixant 45 mg dose. These improvements over placebo 
maintained in the extension period of the study up to 48 weeks show that distinct, yet related, aspects 
of the impact cough on a patient related outcomes may provide additional support for the subjective 
improvements as measured by the LCQ.

Subgroup analyses: The results of the subgroup analyses generally supported the primary analyses. 
The post-hoc, post randomisation subgroup of patients according to taste disorders showed larger 
improvements in the subgroup with taste disorder compared to those without taste disorder.  
The results in the subgroup of patients with a baseline cough rate < 20/h were discussed extensively, 
as the overall improvement in cough/h was numerically smaller than in the complementary group of ≥ 
20 cough/h, while no numerical improvement in the LCQ responder rate was shown (on top of a large 
placebo response. Overall, it was considered that the results of this subgroup finding must be 
interpreted with caution. This subgroup is based on an arbitrary cut-off value of the baseline cough 
rate, and not supported by a biological or pharmacological rational. It is also noted that the largest 
potential for measurement error was observed in the lower cough counts in the validation studies. The 
baseline 24 h cough count is rarely used as a clinical tool, while the guidelines on RCC and UCC do not 
mention a threshold for hourly cough counts to define chronic cough. The efficacy result in this 
subgroup is not extreme which enhances a chance finding. As this product is the first in class for the 
treatment of chronic cough, replication can also not be shown. Based on these considerations, it 
cannot be excluded that the results are based on a chance finding. The post hoc defined subgroup 
according to taste disorder showed larger responses than the subgroup without taste disorder. 
Although this analysis must be interpreted with caution given it is based on a post-randomisation 
subgroup, it appears that the patients that experience side effects may also have the largest benefit. 
Recount data set: Additional supportive analysis was provided based on the data generated after the 
validation and recount of the cough counts based on compression algorithm WHO3V3.0. A total of 
about 90% of the originally provided cough count data set was recounted and confirmed the reported 
results of the primary data set, i.e., a small, but statistically significant improvement in the reduction 
in coughs per hour on top of a large placebo response, at week 12 (Study P027) or at week 24 weeks 
(study P030).  
Subgroup analyses of the recount data set revealed comparable results and support the primary data 
set.  
Additional expert consultation 
Methodology Working Party consultation  
During the procedure, the Methodology Working Party (MWP) was consulted on the proposed validation 
studies. A summary of the questions asked to the MWP and the response as provided to the applicant 
(through the CHMP) is provided below: 
The CHMP comments concern the marketing authorisation application for gefapixant (Article 8.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application), which is proposed to be 
indicated for the treatment of refractory and unexplained chronic cough. During the assessment 
procedure, it became clear that only the cough recording device of the VitaloJAK system has been 
validated, but that the full system, including the compression algorithm and manual cough tagging by 
multiple trained cough analysts, has not been validated against the gold standard for manual cough 
count which is the count of the uncompressed cough recording. The CHMP considers it critical to 
resolve the issues related to the validation of the full VitaloJAK system before the assessment of the 
benefit/risk ratio can be continued. In addition, issues related to the quality controls of the manual 
cough counts by the cough analyses have been identified. The applicant provided an updated version 
of the proposed validation and IRR protocols, which were commended by the CHMP.  
CHMP MWP comments 
• 
Acceptability of the 5% Maximal Allowable Difference (MAD) considering the 
strength of the current treatment effect  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 113/153 
 
 
 
It is agreed that 5% might be an acceptable limit in this specific situation, if conclusions from the 
primary analysis are understood to be robust against differences below such a patient-level MAD. It 
will be important to understand whether any systematic errors are associated with the cough 
frequency as this may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the treatment effect under the 
alternative hypothesis.  
The MAD should reflect clinically irrelevant differences and there should be reassurance that 
differences below the MAD do not alter the conclusions of the clinical trials. This could be supported by 
simulation studies. The applicant is invited to reflect this in the protocol.  
It seems important to consider the possible technical-physiologic-psychological precision which is 
achievable by manual raters based on uncompressed recordings as a reference standard.  
• 
Adequacy of the proposed Bland-Altman methods and supportive analyses given the 
data will not satisfy the distributional assumptions  
The Bland-Altman method is a standard method to descriptively compare two measures on the same 
scale and, therefore, is accepted. The use of alternative methods if the assumptions of the Bland-
Altman method are not met seems acceptable. However, the decision criteria to use one of these 
methods and not the other should be clearly pre-specified and the decisions documented. 
Results of both the planned method and an alternative, robust method, which does not violate the 
assumptions (fallback-method), should be provided, and any inconsistencies should be discussed. 
• 
It is currently proposed to test the variance component of raters to evaluate inter-
rater reliability. Consistent with other measurement evaluation studies, it is recommended to also 
evaluate inter-rater agreement descriptively by calculating the Intra-Class-Correlation (ICC) coefficient 
(with a confidence interval). The thresholds need to be pre-specified. In addition, the applicant may 
consider providing a clinically more interpretable measure of inter-rater agreement, for example the 
average absolute difference between any rater. 
• 
It is currently proposed to include only 5 out of the 8 cough analysts included in the 
IRR study in the analysis, assuming the study already has 95% power with only 5 analysts. 
This is considered a bit counterintuitive given the objective to evaluate analyst-level 
variability.  
The rationale to select 5 out of 8 raters seems to be to avoid “overpowering” the study because of the 
proposed statistical significance testing of the variance component of the raters (analysts). However, 
by reporting inter-rater reliability descriptively as intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (with 
confidence interval), these concerns do not seem relevant anymore. Therefore, it is recommended to 
include all available raters in the statistical model to assess inter-rater reliability. 
• 
Following the validation exercises, it is currently proposed to consider the current 
results (based on the two compression algorithms) as primary and the results based on the 
recounts as sensitivity analysis.  
In general, for testing CHMP prefers to use the analysis according to what was prespecified in the 
protocol. It is therefore agreed to use the current testing results. Sensitivity analysis based on the use 
of compression algorithm v3.0 are also considered to be important, and any inconsistency between the 
two proposed analyses would likely raise concerns.

2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy data from the studies P027 and P030 showed a large placebo response in both the 
original cough count set supported by the recount data set. Despite the large placebo response, the 
clinical benefit was demonstrated by gefapixant 45 mg by showing a significant improvement over 
placebo in an objective measurement of the (the relative reduction in the cough rate/ 24 h) as well as 
an improved responder rate in a patient reported quality of life assessment measured by the LCQ. The 
results of the LCQ responder rate are supported other PRO data with a sustained effect over time, 
showing the consistency of the findings.  
Furthermore, the findings from the pivotal phase III trials are supported by results of two-phase II 
studies MK7264 -P010 and MK7264-P012 where the primary and key secondary cough-related 
outcome measures showed consistent improvements favouring the gefapixant 45 mg. The consistency 
of efficacy is also supported by two additional supportive studies (Study P042 and study P043) showing 
a significant improvement over placebo in cough-related outcomes.  
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety and tolerability assessment for the gefapixant chronic cough programme primarily 
comprises pooled data from the 52-week treatment periods of Studies P027 and P030 (henceforth 
referred to as the P027/P030 Pool). These studies were double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 studies. As the studies had identical entry criteria and dosing regimens and collected the same 
endpoints, it is acceptable to pool the data. 
Both studies were designed to collect safety data from the 52-week treatment period and to collect 
safety data from the ongoing off-treatment Durability Study periods (Study P027 Amendment 03, 
Study P030 Amendment 04) conducted at select sites, and to explore the impact of withdrawing 
gefapixant after 52 weeks of treatment in a subset of participants in the latter. Study P030 also 
includes an ongoing China-specific Extension Study, implemented to extend enrolment in China beyond 
the global study enrolment period to satisfy local regulatory requirements. Data from the ongoing off-
treatment Durability Studies and the China-specific Extension Study are not included.  
Of note, safety data for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies were not integrated with the P027/P030 Pool 
or across study phases because of differences in dosing regimens and study populations. 
Methods and Pooling Strategy for Safety Analyses: MedDRA version 23.0 was used at the time of data 
analysis. This version of MedDRA includes the newly added Preferred Term (PT) of taste disorder. As a 
result of this addition, some Lowest Level Terms (LLTs) previously classified under the PT of dysgeusia 
were classified under the PT of taste disorder. This reclassification may have impacted the frequency of 
AEs of dysgeusia reported in earlier Phase 1 and Phase 2 CSRs. 
Phase 1 and Phase 2: Across the Phase 1 programme in healthy participants, AEs were summarised by 
the following categories: participants who received any dose of gefapixant (referred to as the 
“gefapixant group”), participants who received gefapixant and another study medication (referred to as 
the “gefapixant + other group”), participants who received a study medication other than gefapixant 
(referred to as the “other group”), and participants who received placebo (referred to as the “placebo 
group”). Because of the wide range of doses administered during the Phase 2 programme, Phase 2 AEs 
were summarised by gefapixant total daily dose (<100 mg TDD or ≥100 mg TDD) and placebo. Phase 
2 AEs were further summarised by participants with chronic cough and participants with indications 
other than chronic cough (including healthy participants) to evaluate the safety profiles of these 
subsets.

Phase 3 – P027/P030 Pool: Participants were pooled across the P027 and P030 Studies to 1 of the 
following groups: gefapixant 15 mg BID (referred to as “gefapixant 15 mg”), gefapixant 45 mg BID 
(referred to as “gefapixant 45 mg”), or “placebo” groups. Additionally, both gefapixant dose groups 
were pooled across studies and comprised the “gefapixant 15/45 mg BID pooled” group. Safety for the 
P027/P030 Pool was assessed in the All participants as treated (APaT) population, which included all 
randomised participants who received at least 1 dose of gefapixant or placebo. Participants were 
grouped based on the treatment received. Participants who were cross treated (i.e., took 1 or more 
incorrect dose(s) of study intervention from the randomised assignment of gefapixant or placebo) were 
counted in the highest dose of gefapixant received. 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Across the gefapixant clinical development programme, 2413 participants received at least 1 dose of 
gefapixant in the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies and in the P027/P030 Pool. The 
P027/P030 Pool included 2044 participants who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of the 
study intervention. 
Table 41 Participant exposure to gefapixant 
Phase 3 - P027/P030 Pool: A total of 2049 participants were randomised, and 2044 were treated; 
82.4% of the participants completed the study, and 72.3% completed the study intervention.

Demographics and characteristics 
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across intervention groups. The mean age was 58.4 
years, with approximately one-third of the participants aged ≥65 years; 74.7% of the participants 
were female, and 79.6% were white. The mean BMI was 28.59 kg/m2. More participants had a 
primary diagnosis of RCC (61.5%) than UCC (38.5%).  
Participants had a mean duration of chronic cough of approximately 11 years prior to enrolment, and 
the mean number of coughs per hour over 24 hours at baseline was slightly higher in the placebo 
group than in the gefapixant groups. Additional baseline factors were also generally consistent. 
Baseline smoking status was similar across intervention groups; approximately 74% of participants 
never smoked, and none were current smokers.  
2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
Phase 3 – P027/P030 Pool 
The overall incidence of AEs was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group compared with the gefapixant 
15 mg and placebo groups. Study intervention-related AEs, discontinuation of study intervention due 
to AEs, discontinuation of study intervention due to a study intervention-related AE, and 
discontinuation of study intervention due to a taste-related AE were higher in the gefapixant 45 mg 
group compared with the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups; these imbalances across intervention 
groups were primarily due to taste-related AEs (Table 43).

Common Adverse Events: The most frequently reported AE in any intervention group was dysgeusia 
and was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group than in the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. Other 
most frequently reported AEs (≥10% of participants) in the gefapixant 45 mg group were 
nasopharyngitis, ageusia, headache, and hypogeusia. The most frequently reported AEs (≥10% of 
participants) in the gefapixant 15 mg group were nasopharyngitis, headache, and dysgeusia. The 
incidence of taste-related AEs was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group than in the gefapixant 15 mg 
and placebo groups. The incidences of all other AEs were generally balanced across the gefapixant and 
placebo groups (Table 44).

Adverse Events Related to Study Intervention  
Overall, the incidence of study intervention-related AEs was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group than 
in the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. Of the most frequently reported study intervention-

related AEs (≥5% of participants in the gefapixant 45 mg group), most were categorised in the SOC 
Nervous system disorders, which included the taste-related AEs of dysgeusia, ageusia, hypogeusia, 
and taste disorder (Table 45). 
Table 45 Subjects with drug-related adverse events (incidence ≥ 5% in one or more 
treatment groups) safety pool across P027 and P030 over the period of 52 weeks all 
subjects as treated
Adverse Events by Intensity: The majority of participants reported mild (29.5%) or moderate (42.4%) 
AEs; 7.1% of participants reported severe AEs. The overall incidences of severe and severe drug-
related AEs were higher in gefapixant 45 mg group (8.8% and 3.1%, respectively) compared to 
gefapixant 15 mg (7.9% and 0.4%, respectively) and placebo (6.4% and 0.3%, respectively) groups. 
The incidences of severe AEs across the system organ classes (SOCs) by treatment arm were low 
(<3.5%). The SOCs with an incidence of ≥1% for severe AEs were: Nervous system disorder, 
Infections and infestations, Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorder, and Gastrointestinal disorders. The SOC for Nervous system disorder for 
gefapixant 45 mg, was the only SOC with an incidence ≥1% for both severe (3.1%) and severe drug-
related AEs (2.8%), driven by the higher incidences of taste related AEs. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System: Taste-related AEs, including dysgeusia, ageusia, taste 
disorder, hypogeusia, and hypergeusia, were predefined at the study design stage as safety endpoints 
of special interest, and AEs of paraesthesia oral and hypoaesthesia oral were prespecified safety 
endpoints. PTs of loss of appetite, weight loss, and dehydration were evaluated for potential clinical 
sequelae of taste-related AEs. Renal and urological events, although not prespecified as safety 
endpoints, were reviewed based on preclinical observations. Clinical evaluation included a review of 
PTs indicative of haematuria, crystalluria, and urolithiasis. Specialised urine crystal analysis for 
identifying gefapixant crystals was conducted on urine samples that were confirmed to have crystals or 
unexplained haematuria. The potential for protective cough reflex suppression was reviewed by 
evaluating pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection AEs. To address the theoretical concern and 
subsequent clinical sequelae, specific pneumonia PTs, lower respiratory tract infection PTs, and 
respiratory tract infection PTs were reviewed. Finally, a review of AEs for potential hypersensitivity was

conducted. Specific AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity were reviewed, including but not limited to PTs 
of hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, lip swelling, and tongue pruritis.  
Adverse events of specific interest (AESI) and other prespecified safety endpoints 
The adverse event of specific interest are the taste-related AEs, hypoesthesia oral and paraesthesia 
oral, renal and urinary tract injury, pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection and 
hypersensitivity. 
Taste-related Adverse Events were defined as AESI in the SAP. The overall incidence of taste-related 
AEs was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group than the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. Most 
participants who experienced a taste-related AE did not discontinue study intervention due to a taste-
related AE. Among the participants with taste-related AEs, study intervention discontinuation due to 
taste-related AEs was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group compared with the gefapixant 15 mg and 
placebo groups. The majority of taste-related AEs were of mild or moderate intensity (Table 46). 
Dysgeusia was the most frequently reported taste-related AE and was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg 
group than the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. The individual incidences of ageusia, 
hypogeusia, and taste disorder, were higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group than the gefapixant 15 mg 
and placebo groups, while the incidence of hypergeusia was low (<1.0%) across the intervention 
groups. Most of the taste-related AEs were considered to be related to study intervention by the 
investigator. No taste-related SAEs were reported.

Table 46 Subjects with taste-related adverse events by maximum intensity (incidence > 0% 
in one or more treatment groups) safety pool across P027 and P030 over the period of 52 
weeks; all subjects as treated 
The mean time to onset of any taste-related AE was approximately 9 days in the gefapixant 45 mg 
group compared with ≥36 days in the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. Within 1 week of 
receiving study intervention, approximately 50% of participants in the gefapixant 45 mg group had a 
taste-related AE compared with <8% of participants in the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. The 
mean duration of any taste-related AE was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group (203.9 days) 
compared with the gefapixant 15 mg (178.1 days) and placebo groups (132.6 days). 
All taste-related AEs resolved in 96.0% of the participants in the gefapixant 45 mg group who 
experienced a taste-related AE. In the majority of participants, all taste-related AEs resolved after 
discontinuation of gefapixant treatment (Table 47).

Table 47 Summary of resolution of taste-related adverse events high level safety pool across 
P027 and P030 over the period of 52 weeks; all subjects as treated 
As of 02-Nov-2021, a total of 30 participants (placebo group, n=6; gefapixant 15 mg group, n=9; and 
gefapixant 45 mg group, n=15) had ongoing taste-related AEs. The applicant does not expect to 
receive additional information on the 2 participants who withdrew consent. Updated safety information 
as of 14 Dec 2021 revealed that 6 participants in placebo group (0.9%) 5 participants in gefapixant 15 
mg group (0.7%), and 7 participants gefapixant 45 mg group (1.0%) had ongoing taste-related AEs. 
Out of these 18 participants, information was not available for 2 participants in the placebo group, 1 
participant in the gefapixant 15 mg group, and 4 participants gefapixant 45 mg group. The course of

in the gefapixant 15 mg group (0.1%). There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in 
weight.  
Characterisation of the patient population with taste disorders 
Upon request of CHMP, the applicant provided a post-hoc comparison of the baseline characteristics of 
the patients who experienced taste disorder and of the of population who discontinued due to taste 
disorder. 
Of the 682 patients treated with gefapixant 45 mg, 447 (66%) subjects experienced a taste related 
adverse event compared to 47 (6.9%) of the placebo treated patients.  
Comparing the gefapixant 45 mg group with and without a taste related adverse event, the analysis 
showed that the gefapixant treated patients with a taste related adverse events included a higher 
proportion of UCC patients (41 % vs 34%). The patients with a taste related event had also a slightly 
higher baseline cough count (median 20.7 vs 16.21).  
Regarding discontinuation, 95 (14%) gefapixant 45 mg treated patients and 2 (0%) of placebo treated 
discontinued because of taste-related adverse event. A total of 352 gefapixant 45 mg treated patients 
did not discontinue due to taste related adverse event.  
The differences are small, but the data show that slightly higher proportion of UCC than RCC patients 
treated with gefapixant 45 mg treated experienced a taste disorder and prematurely left the trial 
(17.4% vs 11,2%). The patients that prematurely left had also signs of less severe disease as shown 
by a lower median cough count (15.33 (1-102) vs 21.95 (0-386 coughs/h) and lower proportion of 
VAS score > 60mm (61 vs 71%). No data is provided for the subgroup with a low or high baseline 
cough count (< 20 cough/h or ≥ 20 cough/h).  
The gefapixant 45 mg treated patients who left the study because of taste related adverse events also 
experienced a more frequently AEs of moderate (n=59 (62%) vs n=82 (23%)) or severe intensity 
(n=10 (10%) vs n=7 (2%)) compared to those who remained in the study. 
Other prespecified safety endpoints 
Hypoaesthesia Oral and Paraesthesia Oral 
The overall incidences of hypoaesthesia oral and paraesthesia oral were low (<3.5%) in all intervention 
groups. The incidence of hypoaesthesia oral in the gefapixant 45 mg group was 3.1% compared with 
the gefapixant 15 mg group at 0.9% and the placebo group at 0.1%. Similarly, the incidence of 
paraesthesia oral in the gefapixant 45 mg group was 2.2% compared with the gefapixant 15 mg group 
at 1.5% and placebo group at 0.3%.  
Discontinuation of study intervention due to hypoesthesia oral or paraesthesia oral was low (<0.5%). 
Most incidences of hypoaesthesia oral and paraesthesia oral were considered to be related to study 
intervention and none were SAEs. 
The participants who presented with an oral paraesthesia/oral hypoaesthesia and a taste-related event 
are displayed in Table 49.

Renal and urinary tract injury 
The overall incidence of specific renal and urinary AEs potentially associated with renal and urinary 
tract injury was low (<6.0%) in all intervention groups, and the individual incidences of the 
haematuria, crystalluria, and urolithiasis PTs were low (<3.0%) in all intervention groups. (Table 50)

the gefapixant 45 mg group and 1 participant in the placebo group), and 1 participant with 
ureterolithiasis in the placebo group.  
Renal and urinary AEs that resulted in study intervention discontinuation were haematuria (1 
participant in the gefapixant 15 mg and 1 participant in the placebo groups) and the SAE of 
ureterolithiasis (1 participant in the placebo group). One participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group

tested positive for gefapixant urinary crystals at the last study visit (Week 52); however, the 
concentration of gefapixant in a simultaneous PK plasma sample was below the limit of quantification. 
No adverse clinical sequelae attributable to urinary crystals were observed in this participant.  
Pneumonia and Lower Respiratory Tract Infections 
 The potential for protective cough reflex suppression was reviewed by evaluating pneumonia and 
lower respiratory tract infection AEs. The overall incidence of AEs associated with pneumonia and lower 
respiratory tract infection was low (≤5%) in all intervention groups. The incidences of individual 
pneumonia PTs (atypical pneumonia, pneumonia, pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia staphylococcal, and 
pneumonia streptococcal) were low (≤1.5%) and comparable across the intervention groups. In all 
intervention groups, the incidences of lower respiratory tract infection and respiratory tract infection 
were low (<3.0%) and comparable. Pneumonia SAEs were reported by 6 participants in the gefapixant 
15 mg group, 1 participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group, and none in the placebo group. Respiratory 
tract infection SAEs were reported in 1 participant in the gefapixant 15 mg group and 1 participant in 
the placebo group (Table 51).

Hypersensitivity  
To minimise the potential for hypersensitivity, participants with a history of anaphylaxis or cutaneous 
adverse drug reaction to sulphonamide antibiotics or other sulphonamide-containing drugs were 
excluded from Studies P027 and P030. 
The overall incidence of hypersensitivity AEs was low and comparable across intervention groups, 5.6% 
in the gefapixant 45 mg group, 3.6% in the gefapixant 15 mg group and 5.6% in the placebo group. 
The individual incidences of these specific AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity were low (<2.5%) and 
comparable across the intervention groups, except for minor differences in gastro-intestinal events 
(swollen tongue, lip swelling) and urticaria in disfavour for gefapixant 45 mg. Drug-related events of 
hypersensitivity occurred at a slightly higher rate in the gefapixant 45 mg group (2.0%) compared to 
placebo (1.3%). None of the events was reported as severe or serious in the gefapixant group while

2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
In the P027/P030 Pool, changes in clinical laboratory results were not clinically meaningful. Overall, 
there were no notable differences in mean changes over time in chemistry and haematology 
measurements across intervention groups. Although a small percentage (<1%) of participants tested 
negative for urinary crystals at baseline and subsequently tested positive at Week 52, there were no 
clinically important shifts in participants from baseline to Week 52. The incidences of laboratory 
findings that met predetermined criteria were low (<12%), and individual incidences were generally 
comparable across intervention groups.  
No participant met the criteria of an elevated ALT or AST ≥3x ULN, an elevated total bilirubin ≥2x ULN, 
and an alkaline phosphatase <2x ULN.  
There were no clinically meaningful findings in the P027/P030 Pool in vital sign measurements (blood 
pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate) or weight. Observations were comparable across 
intervention groups.  
2.5.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety

2.5.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
AEs and demographics were summarised for the following subgroups: gender, region (North America, 
Europe, Asia-Pacific, others), age groups, duration of cough (<10 years, ≥10 years), baseline Cough 
Severity VAS (<60 mm, ≥60mm), baseline 24-hour coughs per hour (<20 coughs per hour, ≥20 
coughs per hour), and primary diagnosis (RCC, UCC). At the request of a health authority, post hoc 
analyses of AE summaries and corresponding demographics were conducted in additional age groups 
(≤40 years, 41 to <65 years), additional regions (US, ex-US), race, and BMI (<25 kg/m2, 25 to <30 
kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2). Participants age <65 years account for the majority of the participants in the 
P027/P030 safety pool. The incidence of AEs in that age group were comparable to or lower than the 
incidence in younger participants except for AEs leading to discontinuation. The incidence of events 
leading to discontinuation in adults age 75-84 years (35%) was higher compared to adults age 65-74 
years (27.9%) and <65 years (22.6%).

group, duration of cough, baseline Cough Severity VAS, baseline 24-hour coughs per hour, and 
primary diagnosis, were generally comparable to the overall study population. In addition, analyses for 
additional intrinsic factors, including race, BMI, summarised post hoc based on a health authority

The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention was higher in the gefapixant 45 
mg group (22.1%) compared with the gefapixant 15 mg (8.0%) and placebo (5.8%) groups, primarily 
due to taste-related AEs. The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
intervention (>3% in any intervention group) were dysgeusia and ageusia. Taste-related AEs are 
discussed further under AESI. Participants treated with gefapixant 45 mg who discontinued because of 
an adverse event (n=151 (22%)), had a somewhat longer duration of cough 9 years (2-56 y) vs 7 
years 2-65y), a lower mean weakly cough severity VAS score < 60mm (38% vs 27%) and lower 
baseline cough values (median 16.71 vs 19.88) compared to participants treated with gefapixant 45 
mg who did not discontinue due to adverse event (n=532 (88%)).  
In the participants with a taste disorder, the data show that a slightly higher proportion of UCC than 
RCC patients treated with gefapixant 45 mg treated experienced a taste disorder and prematurely left 
the trial (17.4% vs 11,2%). The patients that prematurely left had also signs of less severe disease as 
shown by a lower median cough count (15.33 (1-102) vs 21.95 (0-386 coughs/h) and lower proportion 
of VAS score > 60mm (61 vs 71%). The gefapixant 45 mg treated patients who left the study because 
of taste related adverse events also experienced a more frequently AEs of moderate (n=59 (62%) vs 
n=82 (23%)) or severe intensity (n=10 (10%) vs n=7 (2%)) compared to those who remained in the 
study. 
2.5.8.10.  Other important safety aspects 
Impact on quality of life 
In a 12-week study, Study P012, participants were asked, “How likely would you be to take this 
medication in reference to each a time frame. Thirty-four of 57 subjects (59.6%) receiving MK-7264 
50 mg BI dose were extremely likely to take study treatment for 4 weeks, and 54.4% of the subjects 
for at least 6 months to 1 year. The incidence of taste-related AEs in P012 participants treated with 
gefapixant 50 mg was 81%.  
In the Phase 3 – P027/P030 Pool, the acceptability questionnaire was not used. Instead, the quality of 
life of the participants can be assessed through the evaluation of the sequalae of taste disorder in 
participants with and without taste-related AEs.

The overall incidence of AEs suggestive of weight loss and dehydration in participants with taste-
related AEs treated with gefapixant was low (<5%), with the incidence of decreased appetite reported 
higher in the placebo arm (8.5%) compared to gefapixant 45 mg (4.7%) and gefapixant 15 mg 
(2.5%). This was supported by quantitative measures of weight, BUN and creatinine. There was no 
difference between participants with and without taste-related AEs treated with gefapixant.  
Participants with taste-related AEs treated with gefapixant remained in the study at rates similar to 
those without taste-related AEs. The majority of participants with taste-related AEs did not discontinue 
due to their AE, and participants who did discontinue reported higher intensities of taste-related AEs 
than those who did not discontinue. Among the participants treated with gefapixant 45 mg, the 
incidences of study completion for participants with and without taste-related AEs were 79.9% vs 
77.5%, respectively.  
Experience from Phase I and Phase II  
Phase I 
The overall incidence of AEs in the Phase 1 programme was higher in the gefapixant group (63.1%) 
compared to the placebo group (44.7%). The most frequently reported AEs (≥5% participants) in the 
gefapixant group compared with the placebo group, were dysgeusia (34.7% and 1.3%, respectively), 
headache (12.0% and 3.9%, respectively), dry mouth (7.5% and 1.3%, respectively), paraesthesia 
oral (7.5% and 0.0%, respectively), hypoaesthesia oral (6.1% and 1.3%, respectively), nausea (5.4% 
and 1.3%, respectively), and hypogeusia (5.2% and 0.0%, respectively). Three participants in the 
gefapixant group and 1 participant in the placebo group discontinued study intervention due to an AE. 
Study intervention-related AEs were higher in the gefapixant group (59.6%) compared with the 
placebo group (32.9%). The most frequently reported study intervention-related AEs (≥5% 
participants) in the gefapixant group compared with the placebo group, were dysgeusia (34.5% and 
1.3%, respectively), headache (9.6% and 3.9%, respectively), paraesthesia oral (7.5% and 0.0%, 
respectively), dry mouth (7.3% and 1.3%, respectively), hypoaesthesia oral (5.9% and 0.0%, 
respectively), and hypogeusia (5.2% and 0.0%, respectively). No deaths or SAEs occurred in the 
Phase 1 programme. 
Specific adverse events: Pollakiuria was observed in 17 subjects (4.0%) in the gefapixant group and in 
0 subjects in the placebo group. Events in the SOC eye disorders were higher in gefapixant compared 
to the other groups, 2.8% 1.9% and 0% for gefapixant, gefapixant + other and placebo, respectively. 
Within the two groups, the incidences of the adverse events (AEs) of ocular hyperaemia and vision 
blurred were reported most frequently (0.7% to 0.9%), but in total, only 4 participants per event. 
Events in the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal, are also higher in the gefapixant group 
compared to the other groups, 9.9% 3.7% and 6.6% for gefapixant, gefapixant + other and placebo, 
respectively. Most frequent were cough (3.1), dry throat (2.8) and throat irritation (2.1%). 
Chocking sensation occurred in 1 subject in the gefapixant group.  
Phase II 
The AEs were summarised by gefapixant total daily dose (<100 mg TDD or ≥100 mg TDD) and 
placebo. Phase 2 AEs were further summarised by participants with chronic cough and participants 
with indications other than chronic cough (including healthy participants). The incidence of AEs overall 
was higher in the ≥100 mg TDD group (94.7%) compared with the gefapixant <100 mg TDD (78.2%) 
and placebo groups (56.4%). Study intervention-related AEs were higher in the ≥ 100 mg TDD group 
(90.4%) compared with the gefapixant <100 mg TDD (48.2%) and placebo groups (26.5%). 
Discontinuations due to AEs and discontinuations due to study intervention-related AEs were higher in 
the ≥100 mg TDD group (16.1% and 14.9%, respectively) compared with the gefapixant <100 mg 
Assessment report

Page 132/153 
 
 
 
TDD (3.6% and 3.0%, respectively) and placebo groups (2.7% and 1.3%, respectively). The 
incidences of SAEs and study intervention-related SAEs were low and balanced across the intervention 
groups. There were 2 SAEs with fatal outcomes, both from Study P016, a study in participants with 
persistent cough due to IPF. One participant in the gefapixant ≥100 mg TDD group with a medical 
history of chronic respiratory failure, end-stage interstitial pneumonia, and IPF died due to acute 
respiratory failure; this SAE was considered possibly related to study intervention by the investigator. 
One participant in the placebo group died due to pneumonia; this SAE was considered not related to 
study intervention by the investigator. 
Specific adverse events: Apart from the adverse events that were already identified in phase I, events 
that were higher in gefapixant < 100 mg total daily dose and gefapixant ≥ 100 mg total daily dose 
compared to placebo are urine output decreased, decreased appetite, cough and dry throat/throat 
irritation.

2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The gefapixant clinical programme comprised 2413 participants who received at least 1 dose of 
gefapixant in the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies and in pivotal studies P027 and P030 
(P027/P030 Pool). The P027/P030 Pool offers extensive safety pool of 2044 participants who received 
at least 1 dose of study drug, of which 683 patients received gefapixant 45 mg for ≥ 52 weeks. The 
safety and tolerability assessment for the gefapixant chronic cough is mainly based on the P027/P030 
Pool. The mean and median duration was close to 52 weeks in 2044 participants in the P027/P030 
Pool. Sufficient number of patients were included to comply with the requirement of ICH1.  
P027/P030 Pool 
A substantially higher proportion of participants were female (74.7%). However, the female 
predominance is consistent with the affected population of RCC and UCC patients in real-world and the 
safety data are reliable and generalisable given the generally similar safety profile between both 
genders. 
The overall incidence of AEs was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group than the gefapixant 15 mg and 
placebo groups. The majority of the AEs were mild or moderate; the frequency of severe AEs was 
highest in the gefapixant 45 mg group (8.1%). The incidences of severe AEs across the system organ 
classes (SOCs) by treatment arm were low (<3.5%). The SOC for Nervous system disorder for 
gefapixant 45 mg was the only SOC with an incidence ≥1% for both severe (3.1%) and severe drug-
related AEs (2.8%). Within that SOC, taste-related AEs were the primary driver for the higher 
incidences in the gefapixant groups. The imbalances in TEAEs are caused by the differences in dry 
mouth and nausea the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders and ageusia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia and taste 
disorders in the SOC Nervous system disorders. Other frequently reported AEs in the gefapixant 45 mg 
group were nasopharyngitis and headache, but without a difference between the groups. However, in 
the phase 1 pool, intervention-related headache was higher. 
A small, but stable trend of higher incidence of AEs in the SOC of Psychiatric disorders has been 
demonstrated for gefapixant exposed patients across all studies. Even if psychiatric disorders are 
mostly consequences of impaired QoL because of chronic cough, it does not explain the disbalance 
between the gefapixant group and the placebo group. Insomnia was the only preferred term with an 
incidence >1%. Also, insomnia was considered as related in the gefapixant group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 133/153 
 
 
 
For the related TEAEs, the imbalance between groups was substantial, i.e., 68.8% for gefapixant 45 
mg compared to 28.3% and 20.4% for gefapixant 15 mg and placebo, respectively. The drug-related 
adverse events that occurred more frequently in gefapixant 45 mg treated patients were ageusia, 
dysgeusia, hypogeusia and taste disorder, dry mouth, and nausea. 
Taste disorder: Taste-related AEs were predefined as safety endpoints of special interest (AESI) based 
on the alleged mechanism of action of gefapixant. Overall, there was a consistent, dose-proportional 
increase in all events of taste-related items i.e., overall incidence, intensity, time to onset, time of 
duration, sequelae and discontinuation. Many taste-related AEs were mild or moderate; 2.5% of taste-
related AEs were severe. Within 1 week of receiving study intervention, approximately 50% of 
participants in the gefapixant 45 mg group had a taste-related AE with a median time of onset of 2 
days. The mean duration of any taste-related AE was longer in the gefapixant 45 mg group, i.e., 203.9 
days. The highest percentage of taste-related AEs was reached at > 4 to ≤ 8 weeks.  
In 96.0% of the participants in the gefapixant 45 mg group who experienced taste-related AEs 
resolved during treatment or after discontinuation of treatment, while in 2.2% of the subjects in 
population (3.4% of the patients with a taste disorder), the event was ongoing (unresolved).Even 
more taste-related AEs were resolved per 14 Dec 2021, i.e. 6 participants in placebo group (0.9%), 5 
participants in gefapixant 15 mg group (0.7%), and 7 participants gefapixant 45 mg group (1.0%) had 
ongoing taste-related AEs. Thus, the resolving of taste related AEs can take quite a while after 
discontinuation of the treatment. The prolonged duration of the taste disorder might be of concern, as 
it may impact the quality of life. However, no clear difference between the treatment groups could be 
observed in the potential sequelae of taste-related AEs (weight decreased, abnormal weight loss, 
dehydration thirst). Furthermore, the impact of taste-related AEs on quality of life was not assessed in 
the studies P027 and P030. However, the acceptability of the drug was measured in the 12-week 
acceptability study (study P012) in subjects with RCC. The results suggested that the taste-related 
events did not negatively affect the acceptability of the drug.  
Furthermore, it is considered important to be informed whether a specific patient group can be 
identified that is more at risk to develop a persistent taste disorder. When comparing the baseline 
characteristics of participants with long-lasting taste disorder, females, participants with UCC and 
patients with VAS ≥ 60 treated with gefapixant appeared to be more likely to have a long-lasting taste 
disorder. However, the small numbers of participants with ongoing taste-related AE make it difficult to 
draw meaningful conclusions. 
It was not possible to give a recommendation on discontinuation and restarting of treatment, as there 
is no experience in the clinical programme with intermittent or temporary discontinuation or dose 
reduction. Therefore, this is up to the opinion of the health professionals as part of their clinical care. 
However, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and description in 4.8 of the SmPC are warranted to 
inform the healthcare professional and the patient about the possibility of a long-lasting taste disorder. 
Further follow-up of these patients is also considered necessary (recommendation).  
A comparison for participant with a positive effect, defined as ≥30% reduction from baseline in 24-
hour coughs per hour or ≥1.3 point increase from baseline in LCQ Total Score according to presence or 
absence of taste disorder, revealed an association between the efficacy and the presence of a taste 
disorder. This occurs also in the subgroup with baseline cough count < 20 cough/h. However, all the 
analyses used the data of subjects who had an efficacy value thus missing out the subject who 
discontinued early. These subjects could have experienced an AE but could not experience (yet) a 
benefit. Thus, the results should be interpreted with caution because they may overestimate the 
difference between the patients with and without AE.  
When regarding the severity of the disease, as defined by cough count and VAS, subgroup analyses 
showed that subjects with a lower cough count (< 20 cough/h) or VAS score (< 60 mm) had a higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 134/153 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation rate and a higher discontinuation rate due to taste related adverse events compared to 
their complementary subgroups of patients with cough count ≥ 20 cough/h or VAS ≥ 60 mm. This 
suggests that subjects with more severe disease tolerate the taste related side effects better. 
However, the differences between complementary subgroups are too small to be conclusive.  
The incidences of AEs representing potential clinical sequelae of taste-related AEs, including weight 
decreased, abnormal loss of weight, dehydration, and thirst, were low (<1.5%) across the intervention 
groups but highest in gefapixant 45 mg. Deceased appetite was somewhat higher with 1.7% in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group. Blood urea increased was reported only in the gefapixant 15 mg group 
(0.1%). In addition, patients with and without a taste disorder in the P027/P030 pool were analysed 
for measures of sequelae, such as decreased appetite, weight decreased, dehydration, or thirst. 
However, these parameters are only a very indirect measure of the quality of life by a taste disorder. 
There was not a clear trend shown in these expected sequelae. However, in the group of participants 
with a taste disorder, the incidence of discontinuation was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg than in 
placebo.  
In the off-treatment Durability Studies, only three subjects with ongoing taste-related AEs were 
included. However, no additional information is available on these subjects.  
Altogether, it would have been helpful to identify patients who will likely develop a taste disorder or a 
persistent taste disorder or who will discontinue.  
Oral paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia: As one of the prespecified safety endpoints, frequencies of 
paraesthesia oral and hypoaesthesia oral were low, with the highest frequency in the gefapixant 45 
mg, i.e., for hypoaesthesia oral and for paraesthesia oral 2.2%. The taste disorders occurred 
concomitantly with oral paraesthesia/hypoaesthesia and appeared to be associated.  
Renal and urological events: These events were reviewed based on preclinical observations that 
gefapixant can cause damage to the kidney, ureter and bladder. Crystalluria was more frequently 
observed in female than in male animals, and a risk on stones was observed. The precipitation of 
crystals was explained by the applicant as likely due to a combination of minimal solubility of 
gefapixant at physiological urine pH, the primary excretion of gefapixant in the kidney and the fact that 
chemical structure contains sulphonamide moiety.  
In the P027/P030 pool, the incidence of specific renal and urinary AEs was 4.8% in the gefapixant 45 
mg group, 5.8% in the gefapixant 15 mg group and 4.6% in the placebo group. The individual 
incidences of haematuria, crystalluria and urolithiasis PTs were low (<3.0%) in all intervention groups. 
Haematuria was higher in the gefapixant groups (2.9%) than in the placebo group (1.9%). The pattern 
for calculi is diverse, but the total number appears to be increased for gefapixant compared to placebo.  
A total of 5 participants reported SAEs, nephrolithiasis, and calculus urinary each in 1 participant in the 
gefapixant 45 mg, calculus urinary in 1 participant in the gefapixant 15 mg groups, and nephrolithiasis 
and ureterolithiasis each in 1 participant in the placebo group.  
Specialised urine crystal analysis for the identification of MK-7264 crystals was positive in one 
participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group on one occasion without any reported AEs potentially 
attributable to urinary crystals. The frequency of the stones was not higher than in the general 
population (5%). However, the study population is not considered fully representative for the 
occurrence of crystalluria and nephrolithiasis because of the higher number of females (74.7%), as the 
incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in males than females above 40 years. Altogether, there were no 
clear signals for the presence of specific renal and urinary AEs but given the higher number of stones 
for gefapixant compared to placebo and the risk of severe clinical sequela of stones, the inclusion of 
these adverse reactions in the SmPC is warranted.

Protective cough reflex suppression: The cough reflex is necessary as protection against infections, and 
suppression may cause serious health risks. The mode of action is not fully explained, and a negative 
effect on the bronchial drainage and cough cannot be excluded in patients with an acute respiratory 
tract infection. The potential for protective cough reflex suppression was reviewed by evaluating 
pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection AEs.  
The incidence of pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection AEs was considered slightly increased 
in the gefapixant 45 mg group (4.2%), and in the gefapixant 15 mg group (5.0%) compared to the 
placebo group (3.3%). Moreover, pneumonia as a SAE was reported in 6 participants in the gefapixant 
15 mg group compared to 1 participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group and none in the placebo group 
Further analyses could not identify a specific patient group that was more at risk to develop pneumonia 
and URTI during the use of gefapixant. As most of the events of pneumonia and LRTI occurred within 
the first 24 weeks, this is rather a general risk than a risk that can be prevented by limiting the 
duration of treatment. Against this background, a warning that the treatment regimen should be 
evaluated and should be individualised for each patient with an acute respiratory infection is proposed 
to be included in section 4.4. of the SmPC.  
As an unexpected finding, cough as an AE, was highest in the MK-7264 45 mg. For inclusion of cough 
as an AE in the trials, the reported event of cough as an AE had to have included one of the terms 
‘worsening’, exacerbation’, ‘increase’ or ‘increased’ in the narrative indicative for a change in cough. 
Given the presence of these adverse events in the Phase I studies in healthy volunteers, it is accepted 
that cough is an adverse event of gefapixant.  
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis: Gefapixant contains a sulfonamide moiety, although it is considered 
to be a non sulfonylarylamine. Specific attention was given to AEs of hypersensitivity because of 
potential cross-reactivity with sulfonamide-containing drugs. Based on the current understanding of 
the pathogenesis of sulfonylarylamine adverse reactions, non-sulfonylarylamines and other 
sulfonamide moiety–containing drugs do not share the same risk on a chemical or metabolic basis 
even though the clinical presentation may appear to be similar. Nevertheless, participants with a 
history of anaphylaxis or cutaneous adverse drug reaction to sulfonamide antibiotics or other 
sulfonamide-containing drugs were excluded from Studies P027 and P030 because of the risk of an 
allergic reaction based on cross-reactivity between gefapixant and sulfonamide antibiotics. The 
individual incidences of specific AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity were low (<2.5%) and comparable 
across the intervention groups, except for minor differences. No events of anaphylaxis/anaphylactic 
event were reported. However, as participants with sulfonamide allergy were excluded in the phase III 
trials, the hypersensitive reaction caused by gefapixant in the trials are not representative for patients 
with sulfonamide allergy. 
SAEs and deaths: Four deaths occurred in the 2 studies in the P027/P030 Pool. None of the deaths was 
considered to be related to study intervention by the investigator. The overall incidence of SAEs was 
low (≤6.0% in all intervention groups) and comparable across intervention groups. Two SAEs were 
considered to be related to study intervention by the investigator, i.e., hypoglycaemia in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group and ureterolithiasis in the placebo group.  
Discontinuation: The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention was higher in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group (22.1%) compared with the gefapixant 15 mg (8.0%) and placebo (5.8%) 
groups, primarily due to taste-related AEs. Adverse events by treatment arm with an incidence of ≥ 
1% leading to discontinuation were dysgeusia, ageusia, taste disorder, cough, and nausea. The 
comparison of the baseline characteristics of the gefapixant treated patient who prematurely left 
because of a taste related adverse event compared to those who remained in the trial despite a taste 
related event showed that a slightly higher proportion of patients UCC than RCC prematurely left the 
trial because of adverse event (48% vs 40%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 136/153 
 
 
 
Laboratory results: Overall, there were no notable differences in mean changes over time in chemistry 
and haematology measurements across intervention groups. In the additional shift tables, there were 
no relevant differences between the groups, except for haematocrit, i.e., an increase in both 
gefapixant groups (13.8% and 11.2%) compared to placebo (9.5%). Furthermore, ‘Haematocrit 
increased’ was more often reported as an AE, i.e., for gefapixant twice (0.3%), while for placebo none. 
Although other parameters indicative for the presence of dehydration did not show any sign of 
dehydration, the haematocrit is a sensitive and early parameter.  
Safety in special populations  
Participant’s age <65 years account for the majority of the participants in the P027/P030 safety pool. 
The incidence of AEs in that age group were comparable to or lower than the incidence in younger 
participants except for AEs leading to discontinuation, that was highest in adults age 75-84 years 
(35%). This could imply that the participant in this age group was rather less willing to accept the 
adverse event than that the events were more serious, as the incidence of serious events was quite 
similar with the age group > 65 years. In the age group 65-74 years, hospitalisations were more 
frequent. It is not likely, that these events were related. 
Phase I: In the phase I study, 19 patients with moderate to severe OSA who were not using PAP, 
gefapixant 180 mg QHS compared to placebo was associated with a lower mean SaO2 and a higher 
proportion of time with SaO2 <90% across all sleep stages, but no difference in the Apnea/Hypopnea 
Index (AHI), which was the primary endpoint. Approximately 6% of participants within the P027/P030 
Pool reported a medical history of sleep apnoea syndrome or apnoea. As the effects of gefapixant on 
SaO2 have not been evaluated in the Phase 3 programme, a warning is included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC that gefapixant should be used with caution in patients with RCC or UCC with untreated 
comorbid OSA.  
From the safety database all adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Gefapixant administered at 15 mg BID and 45 mg BID in adults with RCC or UCC has a generally 
acceptable safety profile. There were no clear signals that suppression of the cough by gefapixant in 
patients with chronic cough is accompanied by suppression of natural airway protection against 
infections, while the clinical studies were long enough to detect such signals. As most of these events 
occurred within the first 24 weeks, it is acceptable to allow the use for an unlimited period of time at 
the decision of the prescriber, but additional warnings are included in the SmPC. 
Taste-related AEs are the most frequently reported AEs in participants who receive gefapixant 45 mg 
BID and are dose-related. Within the taste-related AEs, ageusia and dysgeusia are the most important 
as it can be expected that they would affect the quality of life. However, post-hoc efficacy analyses 
indicated that patients with a taste related disorders experience a larger treatment effect, generally 
alleviating the concern of the impact on the quality of life by the taste disorder. No clear trend could be 
detected in the expected sequelae of a taste disorder, The taste-related AEs did not (yet) resolve in all 
subjects even after more than a year, which is a concern that these taste-related AEs are not 100% 
reversible. Follow-up information from patients with persistent taste disorders will be reported within 
PSURs in the post-authorisation phase. 
Close review of renal and urological events, or hypersensitivity, did not show significant imbalances 
between treatment groups.

Taste-related AEs are the most frequently reported AEs in participants who receive gefapixant 45 mg 
BID and are dose-related. Within the taste-related AEs, ageusia and dysgeusia are the most important 
as it can be expected that they would affect the quality of life. Although most events were mild or 
moderate, in a small proportion of the patients, i.e., 2.2% of the subjects in population (3.4% of the 
patients with a taste disorder), the event of taste disorder was ongoing (unresolved) even after more 
than a year. However, as this risk is already sufficiently characterised within the clinical trials and can 
be sufficiently minimised with routine risk minimisation measures it is accepted that this risk does not 
qualify for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns according to the principles outlined in GVP V 
rev 2.  
In preclinical studies, it was observed that gefapixant can cause damage to the kidney, ureter and 
bladder, and urolithiasis. The individual incidences of the haematuria, crystalluria and urolithiasis PTs 
were low (<3.0%) in all intervention groups. In the safety pool of P027/P030, no specific risk for 
stones could be detected, as the frequency is not higher than in the general population (5%). It is 
accepted that urolithiasis is not included in the summary of safety concerns. Missing information 
included in the RMP refers to gaps in knowledge about the safety of a medicinal product for certainly 
anticipated utilisation or for use in particular patient populations. There is insufficient knowledge to 
determine whether the safety profile differs from that characterised so far.  
As there are no data from the use of gefapixant in pregnant women and toxicological data in animals, 
have shown the excretion of gefapixant in breast milk, the safety profile of use in pregnancy and 
lactation cannot fully be established at this moment. The safety profile of gefapixant within these 
populations will be further characterised by routine pharmacovigilance activities. It is accepted that use 
in pregnancy and lactation is included as missing information.  
‘Patients with comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea’ was included as missing information in the safety 
specifications. The relevance of higher proportion of time with SaO2 <90% across all sleep stages in 
the 19 patients with moderate to severe OSA who were not using PAP is not clear but could be of 
importance. Effects of gefapixant on SaO2 have not been evaluated in the Phase 3 programme.  
It is agreed that ‘severe renal impairment’ is left out of the safety specifications. Estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 OR eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 
with unstable renal function were excluded. Elimination of gefapixant is primarily through renal

excretion. A Phase 1 study in 6 participants with severe renal impairment and 6 participants with end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) confirmed that participants would be expected to have higher drug 
exposure, to the extent that might be clinically meaningful. Modelling of the effect of renal impairment 
on gefapixant PK, support the dosing recommendations for severe renal impairment.  
Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or cutaneous adverse drug reaction to sulphonamide antibiotics 
or other sulphonamide containing drugs were excluded to avoid factors that may confound the 
evaluation of safety and efficacy in the trial. As a result, the safety profile of use in patients with an 
allergy to sulphonamide containing drugs cannot fully be established at this moment. However, the 
likelihood of a hypersensitivity reaction is considered low. The warnings and precautions section of the 
label includes information stating that gefapixant should be used with caution in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to sulphonamides is sufficient. No additional risk minimisation measures are 
warranted.  
Gefapixant suppresses the cough reflex, but complete suppression of the cough reflex is dangerous as 
the lung is then deprived of an essential defence mechanism in case of respiratory tract infection. 
Overall, the frequency of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection was considered slightly 
increased compared to placebo. As gefapixant will be used chronically, (mild) respiratory tract 
infections might be missed, or symptoms might progress due to the suppression of the cough reflex. 
As this is a first in class molecule and the mechanism of action is not fully explained, the potential risk 
of progression of respiratory tract infections (incl. development of pneumonia) due to suppression of 
the cough reflex by gefapixant is not fully characterised and can have an impact on the risk benefit 
balance of the product if confirmed. This risk should be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance 
activities and cases of respiratory tract infections and pneumonia discussed in the PSURs. In line with 
GVP V rev 2, the CHMP considers that progression of respiratory tract infections and risk of 
development of pneumonia qualifies for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns as an important 
potential risk.  
2.6.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
No additional pharmacovigilance activities are proposed at the moment. The PRAC, having considered 
the data submitted, is of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and 
characterise the risks of the product. The PRAC also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to 
monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. 
2.6.3.  Risk minimisation measures 
The SmPC submitted as part of the MAA already reflects the lack of data for “Use in pregnancy and 
lactation” in the relevant sections 4.6 and 5.3. Furthermore, gefapxiant will be a prescription only 
medicine. No further risk minimisation measures beyond routine are deemed necessary for the time 
being. 
2.6.4.  Conclusion 
Currently, only routine risk minimisation measures are proposed by the applicant. If the post-
marketing data should reveal any signals indicating the need for more information, appropriate 
additional measures will be requested. The PRAC considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 
is acceptable.

2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The active substance is not included in the EURD list, and a new entry will be required. The new EURD 
list entry uses the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The requirements for 
submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, 
Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested an alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD) of 20 January (first approval date in Japan in 2022). 
2.8.  Non-Conformity of paediatric studies 
Not applicable. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lyfnua (gefapixant) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In the past, cough was only perceived as a clinical entity. Cough was considered only as a symptom 
from other respiratory disease. Nowadays, chronic cough is recognised as a specific disease entity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 140/153 
 
 
 
Cough is a protective reflex to prevent aspiration into the lung and to enhance airway clearance. 
Cough can be voluntarily inducted, but also various peripheral mechanisms may be involved for 
eliciting chronic cough. However, 5-10% of the adult population has a pathologically excessive and 
protracted cough.  
A cough that pertains for longer than 8 weeks in adults is considered being chronic cough. The 
evaluation of chronic cough starts with searching for a treatable disease. If these co-morbidities are 
treated, cough disappears in many patients The following comorbidities are associated with chronic 
cough: Asthmatic cough/eosinophilic cough, Reflux cough, Postnasal drip syndrome/upper airways 
cough syndrome or iatrogenic cough (use of ACE-inhibitors). However, a proportion of patients have a 
persistent cough despite thorough investigation and treatment according to the published practice 
guidelines. These patients have a: 
1. 
Refractory Chronic Cough (RCC): if they have a cough-associated condition, but the 
conventional treatments do not work 
2. 
Unexplained Chronic Cough (UCC): when no diagnosable cause for the cough has been found 
(despite extensive assessment for common and uncommon cases) 
RCC and UCC may have a major effect on the quality of life as cough may interfere with social life. RCC 
and UCC may lead to in social isolation, interference with speech and depression. Such a risk will be 
increased if RCC and UCC are associated with co-morbidities such as incontinence, cough syncope and 
dysphonia. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, no authorised treatments exist for the treatment of RCC or UCC in the EU. When the initial 
treatment according to published practice guidelines (stop risk factors, start corticosteroids, 
leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), proton pump inhibitors (PPI) does not result in improvement, 
other off-label treatment can be used, such as gabapentin, dextromethorphan, low-dose morphine and 
codeine or speech and language therapy (SLT). These off-label treatments are either associated with 
considerable side effects and/or have limited data to support their use. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of gefapixant’s efficacy derived from two almost identical phase 3 trials. Study P027 
(n=732, main study 12 weeks) and P030 (n=1317, main study 24 weeks) were multicentre, double-
blind, placebo-controlled parallel assignment intervention study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
gefapixant 15 mg bid and 45 mg bid in adults with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic 
cough:  
• 
Refractory chronic cough was defined as participants who have had a clinical evaluation that 
suggested a comorbid condition that may be related to cough (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease 
[GERD], asthma, or upper airway cough syndrome), the participant has received appropriate 
diagnostic work-up and therapy according to ACCP (American College of Chest Physicians guidelines), 
and the participant continues to cough. 
• 
Unexplained chronic cough was defined as participants who have had a clinical evaluation of 
their cough per ACCP guidelines, and this evaluation has not suggested a comorbid condition that may 
be related to cough. 
The main efficacy outcome was a change from baseline in (log-transformed) 24-hour coughs per hour 
(i.e., average hourly cough frequency based on 24-hour sound recordings) at Week 12 (P027) or week 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 141/153 
 
 
 
24 (P030). Secondary outcomes include several patient-reported outcomes, such as the Cough 
Severity Diary (CSD), Cough Severity VAS and Leicester Cough Questionnaire. Study P030 includes 
identical objectives as for study P027, but the main efficacy treatment period is prolonged to 24 weeks 
to show durability of response. The study also included the PRO LCQ in the multiplicity testing 
hierarchy to support the clinical relevance of the reduction in cough frequency, and Study P030 was 
powered for the LCQ endpoint analysis. 
Unlike the 45 mg dose, the 15 mg bid dose failed to show superiority over placebo over the primary 
efficacy parameter in both studies. Therefore, the efficacy appears to be insufficiently demonstrated for 
the low dose and the applicant applies for an indication for the high dose 45 mg only. 
The cough count data set is provided with the integrated Vitalo JAK recording system using three 
different versions of compression algorithms to remove non-cough sounds from the recordings;  
a supportive cough count data set has also been provided based on one compression algorithm 
WHO3v3.0 i.e., the recount data set (see sections above). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal studies 
Primary outcome  
In both pivotal studies, based on results from the MI + ANCOVA including the mITT population of 
treated patients, the 45 mg dose showed superiority over placebo in the estimated relative reduction in 
the number of coughs per 24 hours. 
• 
• 
In study P030, the estimated relative reduction at week 24 was -13.29 % (95% CI -24.74, -
 0.10); p = 0.048 
In study P027, the estimated relative reduction at week 12 was -18.52 % (95% CI -32.76, -
 1.28); p = 0.036 
Secondary outcomes  
Based on results from the MI+ANCOVA approach including the mITT population of treated patients, the 
45 mg doses also showed a showed superiority over placebo in the estimated relative reduction of 
number of awake coughs at week 24 (study P30), and at week 12 for study P027  
• 
• 
In study P030, the treatment difference (estimated relative reduction) was -14.31 % (95% CI  
-25.95, -0.84), p=0.038 
In study P027, the treatment difference (estimated relative reduction) -18.33 % (95% CI -32, 
95, -0.96) p=0.040 
The 45 mg dose showed statistically significant improvements compared with placebo in the responder 
rate in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). In study P030, the difference reached statistical 
significance.  
• 
• 
In Study P030, this response rates for the LCQ were 75.7% and 68.1% respectively, the 
estimated absolute difference with placebo is 7.63% (95% CI 1.34, 13.76); the estimated odd 
ratio is 1.46 (1.07, 1.99) p=0.016 
In study P027, this response rate for the LCQ were 66.9 vs 61.7% respectively, with an 
estimated treatment difference with placebo of 5.25 % (95% CI not provided) at week 12. The 
estimated odds vs placebo ratio is 1.26 (95% CI 0.84, 1.89) 
Additional supportive outcomes were provided by the increase in number of MK-45 mg patients 
compared to placebo showing an improvement in at least the minimal clinically relevant improvement 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 142/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the reduction of baseline cough rate (≥ 30%, ≥ 50% or ≥ 70%) or an improvement ≥ minimal 
clinically important difference in the Cough Symptom dairy or Cough severity VAS. After stopping, no 
rebound effect occurred. The use of gefapixant is not associated with abuse related signals such as 
reported for some other applied cough treatments.  
All treatment analyses on both the original data and recount data show comparable outcome measures 
for the primary and key secondary outcome measures.  
Supportive data for a treatment effect of gefapixant 50 mg are also shown by the two randomised, 
placebo-controlled studies phase II study MK7264-P010 and MK7264-P012, and the top-line results in 
two short term studies MK7264-P042 and MK 7264-P043 for 45mg BID. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Methodological/ statistical  
Despite the goal to collect outcome data after treatment discontinuation or use of prohibited medicine 
(for the treatment policy estimand strategy), not all participants had data available at all time points. 
Less than a third of participants in both studies had “off-treatment” data available after discontinuing 
treatment for the primary endpoint. Therefore, the initially provided analyses were not able to estimate 
the treatment effect under the pre-planned treatment policy estimand strategy. Analyses that account 
for all treated participants in the mITT population, and sensitivity analyses for the treatment policy 
estimand support a conclusion of a treatment effect. Analyses that target the hypothetical estimand 
strategy also suggest a stronger treatment effect under the (hypothetical) scenario where participants 
remained on allocated treatment.  
The study did not include two co-primary endpoints for both an objective and subjective improvement 
in cough score. Only one pivotal trial was sufficiently powered to provide type I protected data for a 
subjective improvement, i.e., the difference in the responder rate in the LCQ ≥ 1.3. However, no 
clinically relevant difference with placebo was defined beforehand. 
Methodological/statistical/ clinical  
Concerns were raised by the CHMP during the assessment about the validation of the full VitaloJAK 
cough counting system. Although the VitaloJAK audio recording device has been FDA cleared as an 
audio-recording system, the overall integrated system of VitaloJAK audio recording, Web Portal, 
compression algorithm and cough count analyses is not. Upon request of the CHMP, the applicant 
provided results from 1) a study focused on the validation of the compression algorithm, 2) an Inter-
rater reliability study of cough count analysts. These studies were performed using only one of the 
algorithms that was used in the two clinical studies: i.e., v3.0 compression algorithm with single 
channel processing. Based on the results from these studies, it was concluded that the full VitaloJAK 
cough counting system was valid for use in the clinical studies.  
Just over 90% of the coughs in the original data were compressed using the two algorithms with dual 
channel processing, these cough recordings were re-compressed using WHO3.v3.0 compression 
algorithm with single channel processing. The recount data were analysed, and the set of results from 
these data are considered as supportive to the original data.  
Although the two compression algorithms with dual channel processing were not part of the validation 
study, the results are considered to be sufficiently similar to support a decision to maintain the original 
data as the primary data source. 
The currently provided subgroup analyses for the primary outcome of the original data set are not 
analysed according to the mITT (MI+NCOCA, but according to the longitudinal data for the full 
Assessment report

analyses set; while for the LCQ subgroup analyses, invertedly adjusting is missed for the treatment 
status during the MI step.  
More patients in the active treatment arm prematurely discontinued the trial than the placebo group. 
The difference with placebo in discontinuation rate was about 13% in the main phase and 15% for the 
total trial duration.  
Unlike the phase II studies, both pivotal phase III studies showed a large and continuing placebo effect 
in both the objective and subjective outcome measures. The observed placebo effect exceeded the 
differences between treatment and placebo. The included patient population is heterogeneous and not 
selected on a reduced threshold during the ATP cough challenge test.  
Except for RCC and UCC, the subgroups were not based on a distinct pathophysiological or 
pharmacological rationale, or distinct well-recognised distinct disease entities. No baseline 
characteristics could be identified to select a population that would most likely benefit. 
Post-hoc provided subgroup analyses of the original data set suggested an association between the 
taste effects and the reduction in coughs and response to the LCQ, including the subgroup of patients 
with a baseline cough count< 20 cough/h.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the clinical development programme, 2,413 participants received at least 1 dose of gefapixant. In 
the pivotal studies (P027/P030 Pool) that included 2,044 participants, 683 patients received gefapixant 
45 mg for ≥ 52 weeks. In this P027/P030 Pool, the overall incidence of the AEs was higher in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group compared to the gefapixant 15 mg and placebo groups. While the majority of 
the AEs were mild or moderate, the frequency of severe AEs was highest in the gefapixant 45 mg 
group (8.1%).  
The imbalances in TEAEs are caused by the differences in AEs ageusia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia and 
taste disorder in the SOC Nervous system disorders, and dry mouth and nausea in the SOCs 
gastrointestinal disorders. Other frequently reported AEs (≥10% of participants) in the gefapixant 
45 mg group were nasopharyngitis and headache, but without a difference between the groups. The 
incidences of all other AEs were generally balanced across both gefapixant groups and placebo groups. 
Similarly, for the related TEAEs, the imbalance between groups was substantial, i.e., 68.8% for 
gefapixant 45 mg compared to 28.3% and 20.4% for gefapixant 15 mg and placebo, respectively. The 
imbalance is mainly driven by an imbalance in taste disorders. The incidence of severe taste-related 
AEs was low (2.5%).  
Taste related AE: There was a consistent, dose-proportional increase in all events of the taste-related 
AEs in overall incidence, intensity, time to onset, time of duration, sequelae and discontinuation. The 
onset of the event was fast and the duration longer: within 1 week approximately 50% of participants 
in the gefapixant 45 mg group had a taste-related AE, and the mean duration was longer in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group 203.9 days. All taste-related AEs resolved in 96.0% of the participants in the 
gefapixant 45 mg group, during treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. The incidences of AEs 
representing potential clinical sequelae of taste-related AEs, e.g., decreased appetite and thirst, were 
low (<1.5%) across the intervention groups but highest in gefapixant 45 mg.  
Paraesthesia oral and hypoaesthesia oral: The frequencies of paraesthesia oral and hypoaesthesia oral 
were low but highest in the gefapixant 45 mg, i.e., for hypoaesthesia oral and for paraesthesia oral, 
2.2%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 144/153 
 
 
 
 
Renal and urological events: In preclinical studies, it was observed that gefapixant can cause damage 
to the kidney, ureter and bladder, and urolithiasis. The individual incidences of the haematuria, 
crystalluria and urolithiasis PTs were low (<3.0%) in all intervention groups; Specialised urine crystal 
analysis were identified in 1 participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group on one occasion. 
Pneumonia and URTI: The incidence of pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection AEs was 
balanced between treatments (4.2%). Serious events of pneumonia were higher in the gefapixant 
45 mg group.  
Hypersensitivity: The incidence of AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity was Comparable between the 
intervention groups. The individual incidences of these specific AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity were 
low (<2.5%) and generally comparable across the intervention groups. None were SAEs.  
Cough: Cough as an AE was higher reported in the gefapixant 45 mg group than in the gefapixant 
15 mg and placebo group.  
Deaths and other SAE: Four deaths occurred in the P027/P030 Pool, of which two deaths occurred in 
the gefapixant 15 mg group and two deaths in the placebo group. None of the deaths was considered 
to be related to study intervention by the investigator. The overall incidence of SAEs was low (≤6.0% 
in all intervention groups) and comparable across intervention groups. Only a case of hypoglycaemia in 
the gefapixant 45 mg group and ureterolithiasis in the placebo group were related to study 
intervention by the investigator.  
Discontinuation: Discontinuation because of an AE was higher in the gefapixant 45 mg group (22.1%) 
compared with the gefapixant 15 mg (8.0%) and placebo (5.8%) groups. Adverse events by treatment 
arm with an incidence of ≥ 1% leading to discontinuation were dysgeusia, ageusia, taste disorder, 
cough, and nausea. The gefapixant 45 mg treated patients that discontinue because of taste related 
adverse appeared to have a somewhat longer duration of cough (median 10 years vs 7 years), lower 
baseline cough count (<20 coughs/h) and lower baseline and VAS score (< 60) compared to the 
gefapixant treated patients that did not discontinue because of taste related adverse event. The 
proportion of UCC patients was also slightly higher. The gefapixant 45 mg treated patients that 
prematurely discontinued because of taste related adverse event, experienced more AEs of moderate 
(62% vs 23%) and severe intensity (10% vs 2%) compared to those who remained in the study.  
Safety in special populations: Generally, the incidences of all AE summary measures were reasonably 
balanced between subgroups, including gender. Only AEs leading to discontinuation was higher in 
adults aged 75-84 years compared to other age groups (> 65, 65-74, 75-84, ≤ 85 years).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Gefapixant suppresses the cough reflex, but complete suppression of the cough reflex is dangerous as 
the lung will be deprived of an essential defence mechanism in case of respiratory tract infection. 
Overall, the frequency of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection could be considered slightly 
increased compared to placebo, as most of these events occurred within the first 24 weeks, which 
cannot be prevented by limiting the duration of treatment. Further analyses could not identify a 
specific patient group that was more at risk to develop pneumonia and URTI during the use of 
gefapixant. 
Taste disorders occurred frequently (65.4%). The quality of life is recognised to be affected by taste 
disorders like ageusia or dysgeusia, that can be seriously important. The impact on the quality of life of 
ageusia or dysgeusia by gefapixant is not measured in the pivotal 027 and 030 studies, but an 
acceptability assessment in the 12-week Study P012 did not show a difference between the patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/357321/2023 Corr.1 
Page 145/153 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with gefapixant 50 mg BID and the placebo-treated patient. Furthermore, there was no 
difference between participants with and without taste-related AEs treated with gefapixant in the 
incidence of AEs suggestive of consequences of taste-related AE. In the P027/P030 pool, although the 
continuation of treatment seems reasonably re-assuring in the studies, it remains unsure how this 
effect on taste will impact the quality of life in real life. This adverse event will be monitored in the 
PSURs. 
In some patients, 2.2% of the subjects in population (3.4% of the patients with a taste disorder), the 
event of taste disorder was ongoing (unresolved) even after more than a year. Hence, ongoing taste-
related AEs could resolve during the or after the treatment discontinuation, still leaving 7 participants 
gefapixant 45 mg group (1.0%) with ongoing taste-related AEs per 14 DEC 2021 which was 
comparable to the placebo group (0.9%).  
The frequencies of paraesthesia oral and hypoaesthesia oral were low. They appear to be associated 
with taste disorders. Although no serious crystalluria and nephrolithiasis related events were reported, 
the representativeness of these results can be questioned as the study population is not considered 
fully representative. The results of hypersensitivity reaction may be underrepresented, because 
participants with a history of anaphylaxis or cutaneous adverse drug reaction to sulfonamide antibiotics 
or other sulfonamide-containing drugs were excluded from Studies P027 and P030. A small, but stable 
trend of higher incidence of AEs in the SOC of psychiatric disorders has been demonstrated for 
gefapixant exposed patients across all studies, which cannot be fully explained by impaired QoL. 
Insomnia was the only preferred term with an incidence >1% (and more frequently in the gefapixant 
treatment groups. 
In the phase I study P039, in patients with moderate to severe OSA who were not using PAP, 
gefapixant 180 mg QHS compared to placebo was associated with a lower mean SaO2 and a higher 
proportion of time with SaO2 <90% across all sleep stages.

treatment effect under the treatment policy estimand 
strategy remains uncertain. Sensitivity analyses 
support evidence of an effect.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
During the assessment, two different sets of data (originally provided and recount validated cough 
count data set) and results based on different methods of analyses were provided. The results provide 
a consistent signal of a modest treatment effect on top of a large placebo response in a population with 
a long history of chronic cough, i.e., > 10 years in both the original and recount data set. 
Favourable effects  
Both studies met their objective primary endpoint, the reduction in the cough/h during 24 h, in a 
patient population with cough duration of chronic cough > 10 years in both studies. The clinical 
relevance of the reduction in cough rate was demonstrated by a statistically significant increase in the 
number of patients that experienced a clinically relevant improvement in the quality of life as 
measured by the LCQ at week 24 in study 030, while supportive effects were observed in the study 
P027 of shorter duration (12 weeks). In both studies, the additional secondary patient-reported 
outcome measures supported these outcomes, including when more stringent criteria for the definition 
of responder were applied, for both the objective outcomes (i.e., % reduction in cough count) and PRO 
related criteria. 
The maintenance of efficacy over time was supported with the maintenance of the improvements in 
the patient reported outcomes when measured in the extension study. Thus, the data suggest a 
modest but clinically relevant effect of gefapixant.  
Subgroup analyses: These generally showed the consistency of the efficacy in both the primary data 
set and the recount data set with improvements in both the reduction in cough rate and LCQ responder 
rate. The subgroup with a baseline cough count < 20 cough/h showed a reduction in cough rate, but 
no improvement in the LCQ responder rate on top of a large placebo response. However, the results of 
this exploratory subgroup must be interpreted with caution, despite the large numbers included. In 
clinical practice, the baseline cough count is hardly objectivated as the 24 h cough monitoring is rarely 
used as a clinical tool. The subgroup with a baseline cough count is based on an arbitrary cut off value 
and is not supported with a biological or pharmacological rational, nor a well-recognised disease entity. 
The reported efficacy result is not extreme. 
Based on these considerations, it cannot be excluded that the limited efficacy results in this subgroup 
is due to a chance finding (see EMA/CHMP/539146/2013 31 Jan 2019: Guideline on the investigation of 
subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials). As the overall efficacy is shown, this subgroup will also likely 
receive benefit from the treatment.  
Unfavourable effects 
Compared with patients in the placebo group, more patients in the gefapixant 45 mg-treated patient 
group discontinued prematurely, a difference which was driven by taste related adverse events. Taste-
related AEs were the most important, dose dependent AEs, with dysgeusia, as most frequently 
reported AE up to 65%.  
Although most events were mild or moderate, in a small proportion of the patients, i.e., 2.2% of the 
subjects in population (3.4% of the patients with a taste disorder), the event of taste disorder was 
ongoing (unresolved) even after more than a year that is considered important, as this is associated 
with a loss of quality of life. Thus, in general, ongoing taste-related AEs could resolved after treatment 
discontinuation, leaving a comparable and low incidence between gefapixant 45 mg group and placebo

group. Unwarranted cough reflex suppression as a loss of protective mechanisms against infections is 
considered potentially important as complete suppression of the cough reflex is dangerous as the lung 
is then deprived of an essential defence mechanism. Small differences in pneumonia or LRTI, mostly 
occurring within the first 24 weeks, were observed, which cannot be prevented by limiting the duration 
of treatment. Additional warnings in the SmPC have been warranted to limit the risks. The observed 
association between efficacy and taste disorder, including the subgroup of subjects with cough count 
>20/h, alleviates the concern that these patients might be exposed to the prolonged side effects of the 
treatment or a detrimental effect on quality of their life. 
Impact of uncertainties and limitations of the data on the importance of the unfavourable effects: The 
effect on the quality of life of taste disorders has not been investigated, thus the impact on quality of 
life is not quantified. However, it is known from other diseases, e.g., COVID-19 and treatments that 
affect the taste, that the impact can be high. Indirect measures impacted by a taste disorder did not 
reveal a difference between participants with and without a taste disorder. However, it is unclear how 
patients would have assessed the effect on the quality of life in real life.  
It is not possible to give a recommendation on discontinuation and restarting of treatment, as there is 
no experience in the clinical programme with intermittent or temporary discontinuation or dose 
reduction. A warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and description in 4.8 of the SmPC are warranted to 
inform the healthcare professional as part of their clinical care and the patient about the possibility of a 
long-lasting taste disorder. 
Additional post-hoc analyses were provided to identify the baseline characteristics of the gefapixant 
45 mg treated patients who prematurely left because a taste related adverse event. The patients who 
discontinued had a somewhat lower disease burden and experienced more moderate to severe taste 
disorders compared to those who remained in the study.  
Based on the animal studies, crystalluria and urolithiasis were of concern as these events could lead to 
kidney damage and ultimately to renal impairment. Although no evidence was found in the clinical 
studies, the study population was not fully representative. Therefore, the significance is still unknown. 
The results of a phase I study in patients with moderate to severe OSA who were not using PAP, 
showed that a high dose of gefapixant (180 mg QHS) had a negative impact on mean SaO2 and the 
proportion of time with SaO2 <90%. The significance of these findings is unknow for the proposed 
lower posology (gefapixant 45 mg BID) is unknown. A warning in the SmPC was included to limit the 
risk. For patients with OSA, appropriate treatment for OSA should be considered prior to initiating 
treatment with gefapixant. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The results based on the original and recount data set show a modest, clinically relevant effect in 
reducing the relative cough rate and difference in the LCQ responder rate for gefapixant 45 mg in the 
presence of a large placebo response. The results of the LCQ responder rate are supported with the 
outcomes of other Patient reported outcomes showing consistency of findings with improvement that 
are maintained overtime, providing further support for the benefit of gefapixant.  
Treatment is generally well tolerated, and only a low number of SAEs are reported. The most 
frequently reported adverse events are taste-related adverse events, which are likely to be associated 
with efficacy. Most taste disorders resolved upon treatment discontinuation, and only in a minority of 
cases the taste disorder remained, with an incidence comparable to placebo. Both chronic cough and 
taste disorders affect the quality of life.

Of concern is the possible impairment of the physiological defence mechanism against pathogens, 
foreign objects or endogenous secretions. During the trial, a slightly higher incidence of pneumonia 
was observed within the first 24 weeks of treatment in the gefapixant 45 mg group compared to 
placebo. This suggests that the use of the treatment should be limited during a period of respiratory 
infection and a warning in section 4.4. is included in order to minimise this risk.

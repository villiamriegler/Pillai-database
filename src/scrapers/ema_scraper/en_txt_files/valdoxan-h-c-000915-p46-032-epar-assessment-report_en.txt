1.  Introduction 
On  25th  April  2022,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Valdoxan  (agomelatine),  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s).  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
About the product 
Agomelatine is a melatonergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and 5-HT2C antagonist.  
Valdoxan was first authorised via the centralised procedure in 2009.  
Approved indication  
Valdoxan is indicated for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults. 
Excerpt  of  the  posology  (for  a  view  of  the  complete  posology,  please  refer  to  the  approved  SmPC  of 
Valdoxan): 
Adults:  The  recommended  dose  is  25  mg  once  daily  taken  orally  at  bedtime.  After  two  weeks  of 
treatment, if there is no improvement of symptoms, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily, 
i.e., two 25 mg tablets, taken together at bedtime. 
Decision of dose increase has to be balanced with a higher risk of transaminases elevation. Any dose 
increase to 50 mg should be made on an individual patient benefit/risk basis and with strict respect of 
Liver Function Test monitoring. Liver function tests should be performed in all patients before starting 
treatment.  Treatment  should  not  be  initiated  if  transaminases  exceed  3  X  upper  limit  of  normal  (see 
sections  4.3  and  4.4).  During  treatment  transaminases  should  be  monitored  periodically  after  around 
three  weeks,  six  weeks  (end  of  acute  phase),  twelve  weeks  and  twenty-four  weeks  (end  of 
maintenance  phase)  and  thereafter  when  clinically  indicated  (see  also  section  4.4).  Treatment  should 
be  discontinued  if  transaminases  exceed  3  X  upper  limit  of  normal  (see  sections  4.3  and  4.4).  When 
increasing the dosage, liver function tests should again be performed at the same frequency as when 
initiating treatment. 
Treatment  duration:  Patients  with  depression  should  be  treated  for  a  sufficient  period  of  at  least  6 
months to ensure that they are free of symptoms. 
Elderly: No effect is documented in patients ≥75 years. Therefore, agomelatine should not be used by 
patients in this age group. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study CL3-20098-076, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of agomelatine 
in children (from 7 to less than 12 years) and adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years) with major 
depressive disorder, is part of a clinical development program. The extension application consisting of 
the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by the end 
of September 2022. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

Of  note,  previously  study  CL2-075,  aiming  at  evaluating  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of 
agomelatine in children (from 7 to less than 12 years) and adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years) 
with  depressive  or  anxiety  disorder,  has  been  submitted  and  evaluated  (procedure  EMEA/H/915-
916/P46/027). In the Assessment Report from that procedure, it was considered that the report on the 
study  and  the  population  PK  model  was  sufficient  at  that  stage.  The  PK  database  and  the  modelling 
approach had some limitations, however the model appeared reasonably robust to describe and predict 
the PK of agomelatine at the higher dosages > 10 mg. 
In the present procedure no SmPC changes are suggested. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Oral film-coated tablets of 10 and 25  mg strengths were used for agomelatine, as appropriate to the 
study population and already tested in the CL2-075 study (procedure EMEA/H/915-916/P46/027).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  Study CL3-20098-076   
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CL3-20098-076 
A  double  blind,  12-week,  randomised,  multicentre,  two  dose  levels,  active  and  placebo-controlled 
Phase  III  trial  to  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  of  agomelatine  to  treat  children  from  7  to  less  than  18 
years  of  age  with  major  depressive  disorder.  An  optional  open-label  21-month  extension  period  was 
also included. 
Description 
The figure below shows the study plan: 
*If no improvement at W002, the fluoxetine dose could be increased to 20 mg at the investigator’s judgment. 
**The follow up period was dedicated to: 
all patients who withdrew prematurely from the study at any moment. 
all patients who did not continue into the extension period. 
all patients who completed the extension period. 
***During the extension period the dose could be adjusted at each visit (flexible dose, either to increase to 25 mg or decrease again 
to 10 mg) by the investigator based on the clinical picture of patient.

Methods 
Study participants 
Excerpt of criteria for inclusion (not exhaustive): 
-  Male or female, aged from 7 to less than 12 or from 12 to less than 18 years of age. 
- 
Primary diagnosis of MDD, single or recurrent episode, of moderate to severe intensity, as per   
Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Episode, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). 
-  CDRS-R Raw score ≥ 45. 
-  Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) rating score ≥ 4. 
- 
Patients considered as non-responder to Manualized Psychosocial Counselling during the run-in 
period. 
-  Absence of hepatic impairment (e.g., patients with transaminases values [AST and/or ALT] ≥ 2 
times the upper limit of normal range [ULN] were excluded). 
-  Absence of high suicidal risk. 
At W012 visit, all patients who could benefit from a continuation of a treatment with agomelatine were 
offered to enter in the open-labelled safety extension period. 
Treatments 
Test drug: 
Agomelatine:  10  mg  and  25  mg,  one  film-coated  tablet  taken  once  a  day,  orally,  in  the  evening  at 
bedtime. 
Comparator (reference product and placebo), only during the double-blind period: 
Fluoxetine:  10  mg  (2.5  mL)  with  a  possible  increase  to  20  mg  (5  mL)  at  W002,  oral  solution  taken 
once a day, in the morning at wake-up. 
Placebo:  one  film-coated  tablet  taken  once  a  day,  orally,  in  the  evening  at  bedtime  or  oral  solution 
taken once a day, in the morning at wake-up. 
Open-label  follow-up  extension  period  of  21  months  (from  W012  to  W104)  for  patients  who  could 
benefit  from  a  continuation  of  a  treatment  with  agomelatine:  from  W012  to  W014,  each  patient 
received  agomelatine  10  mg.  From  W014  to  W104,  the  dose  could  be  adjusted  at  each  visit  (flexible 
dose, either to increase to 25 mg or decrease again to 10 mg). Finally, there was a follow-up period of 
1 week on average (5 to 7 days) without any investigational medicinal product (IMP) after the last IMP 
intake (after W012, W104 or in case of premature withdrawal from the study at any moment). 
Objective(s) 
The purpose of the study was to assess the short-term efficacy and the short-term safety of two doses 
of agomelatine in children and adolescent patients with Moderate to Severe Major Depressive Disorder 
(MDD). 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the antidepressant short-term efficacy of at least one of the 
two doses of agomelatine compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in children (from 7 to less 
than 12 years of age) and adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years of age) suffering from moderate 
to severe Major Depressive Disorder using Children’s Depression Rating Scale – Revised (CDRS-R).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/627886/2022  
Page 5/16 
 
 
 
The secondary objectives were: 
- to assess the short-term and long-term safety of agomelatine (10 mg, 25 mg). 
- to evaluate the long-term efficacy of agomelatine (10 mg, 25 mg). The secondary efficacy endpoints 
included  results  from  various  scores  such  as  Clinical  Global  Impression-Severity  and  -Improvement 
(CGI-S and CGI-I, respectively), Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) total score and Adolescent 
Depression Rating Scale (ADRS) total score (only in adolescents of the FAS). 
- to explore efficacy and safety in children and adolescents separately. 
Sample size 
After  amendment  of  the  protocol,  it  was  planned  that  overall,  at  least  390  patients  (instead  of  484) 
with at least 312 adolescents (divided in each treatment group) allowed to conclude that at least one 
dose  of  agomelatine  was  superior  to  placebo  with  a  power  of  89%  in  the  overall  population  and  a 
power of 80% in the subgroup of adolescents, assuming an effect size of 0.50. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The treatment (agomelatine 10 mg, agomelatine 25 mg, placebo, fluoxetine) was assigned at inclusion 
(W000)  by  balanced  (non-adaptative)  randomisation,  with  stratification  on  the  country  and 
children/adolescents age set. It was done using an Interactive Response System (IRS).  
The  12-week  period  of  the  study  was  conducted  in  double-blind  conditions  (i.e.,  in  the  agomelatine 
groups  5  ml  oral  solution  of  placebo  was  given  in  the  morning  and  1  tablet  of  agomelatine  in  the 
evening;  in  the  fluoxetine  group,  5  ml  oral  solution  of  fluoxetine  was  given  in  the  morning  and  1 
placebo tablet in the evening while in the placebo group 5 ml placebo oral solution and 1 placebo tablet 
were given in the morning and evening, respectively). 
Statistical Methods 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  carried  out  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS).  The  Last  Observation  Carried 
Forward  (LOCF)  approach  was  used  to  handle  missing  data.  For  the  primary  analysis  a  three-way 
analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  was  used.  The  step-down  Dunnett  procedure  was  used  to 
control  the  familywise  error  rate,  since  2  doses  of  agomelatine  were  compared  to  placebo.  The 
estimate  of  the  difference  between  adjusted  treatment  group  means,  associated  standard  error,  two-
sided 95% confidence interval and Dunnett-adjusted p-value were provided. 
Sensitivity  analyses,  assessing  the  robustness  of  the  primary  analysis,  were  performed  in  addition  to 
subgroup analyses in adolescents (12-17 years). Due to the small sample size in children, no statistical 
comparison test was performed in this subgroup, only descriptive statistics were provided. 
Results 
Participant flow and number analysed 
Four  hundred  (400)  patients  were  included;  among  them,  320  (80.0%)  were  adolescents  and  80 
(20.0%)  were  children.  The  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  4  groups  (Modified 
Randomised  Set;  MRS):  102  patients  (whereof  81  adolescents)  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group,  95 
(whereof  76  adolescents)  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg  group,  103  (whereof  82  adolescents)  in  the 
placebo group and 100 (whereof 81 adolescents) in the fluoxetine group.

The  FAS  consisted  of  102  patients  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group,  94  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg 
group, 101 in the placebo group and 99 in the fluoxetine group. 
Recruitment 
Forty-six (46) centres in 9 countries included 400 patients. The study was initiated on February 23rd, 
2016 and completed on October 27th 2021. 
Main baseline data (not exhaustive) 
Age and gender: 
The patients of the MRS were 7 to 17 years old with a mean age of 13.7 (SD: ± 2.7) years. Almost 2 
thirds of patients in the study were female (62.5%). 
Condition: 
Overall, according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria, 286 patients (71.5%) were in their first episode of major 
depressive  disorder  (MDD)  with  a  higher  rate  in  the  agomelatine  10  and  25  mg  groups  (78.4%  and 
74.7%, respectively) than in the placebo (64.1%) and fluoxetine (69.0%) groups. 
As required in the selection criteria, all patients had CDRS-R raw total score ≥ 45 with a mean of 65.5 
±  8.4.   CGI-S  score  was ≥  4  with  a  mean  of  4.9  ±  0.6.  The  mean  CGAS  score  was  46.5  ±  8.2.  The 
specific adolescents scale, ADRS, showed a mean score at baseline of 33.1 ± 6.0. 
According  to  Columbia-suicide  severity  rating  scale  for  children,  23.0%  of  the  patients  had  suicidal 
ideation  in  their  lifetime  (highest  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group  with  25.5%).  Overall,  3.5%  had 
suicidal  behaviour  in  their  lifetime  with  a  higher  rate  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg  (6.3%)  than  in  the 
placebo (1.9%) groups. 
The major depressive episode (MDE) was diagnosed (according to DSM-IV-TR criteria) as moderate in 
most of the patients (61.8%); and as severe without psychotic features in 153 patients (38.3%) with a 
lower rate in the agomelatine 10 mg group (27.5%) compared to the other 3 groups (between 41.0% 
and 43.7% according to treatment group).  
The mean duration of current episode was 143.4 ± 153.2 days with a median of 96.0 days (range from 
29  to  1463  days).  This  mean  duration  was  higher  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group  (181.2  ±  210.0 
days)  compared  to  the  other  3  groups  (125.2  ±  109.2  to  137.0  ±  130.5  days),  mainly  due  to  a 
maximum  equal  to  1463  days  (~4  years).  A  total  of  114  patients  (28.5%)  already  had  a  history  of 
previous  MDE  (recurrent  episode),  with  a  lower  rate  in  agomelatine  10  mg  and  25  mg  (21.6%  and 
25.3%,  respectively)  groups  than  in  the  placebo  (35.9%)  and  fluoxetine  (31.0%)  groups.  In  these 
patients, the number of episodes in their lifetime before the current episode ranged from 1 to 5 with a 
mean ± SD of 1.4 ± 0.7 episodes. The duration between the previous episode and the current episode 
start  ranged  from  24  to  1817  days  (~5  years)  (mean  ±  SD  =  428.9  ±  395.4  days).  The  duration  of 
last episode was between 1 and 852 days (mean ± SD = 150.9 ± 157.2 days). 
Efficacy results 
The main results of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to last post-baseline value in 
the CDRS-R raw total score - FAS) are summarised in the table below:

As can be seen from the table above, the results were statistically significant only for agomelatine 25 
mg  vs.  placebo.  Differences  between  placebo  and  agomelatine  10  mg  and  between  placebo  and 
fluoxetine were not statistically significant. 
In  the  children  subgroup;  due  to  the  too  low  number  of  patients,  no  statistical  inference  was 
performed. 
Short overview of some results from the secondary efficacy endpoints: 
CGI-S:  The  difference  of  the  means  of  CGI-S  score  of  the  last  post-baseline  value  between  placebo 
(3.8  ±  1.2)  and  each  agomelatine  dose  regimen  (3.5  ±  1.1  for  both  agomelatine  doses)  was  only 
statistically significant in favour of agomelatine 10 mg with the Mann-Whitney test (p = 0.035). In the 
adolescents  of the FAS, no statistically significant  difference  between treatment groups was observed 
with any of the statistical tests (unplanned analysis). 
CGI-I: Regarding the mean CGI-I score, no statistically significant difference of the last post-baseline 
value, between placebo (2.7 ± 1.1) and each agomelatine dose (2.6 ± 1.1 in the agomelatine 10 mg 
group and 2.5 ± 1.0 in the agomelatine 25 mg group) nor between placebo and fluoxetine (2.6 ± 1.0), 
was observed with any of the statistical tests. Similar results were observed in the adolescents of the 
FAS.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  response  to  treatment  (defined  as  CGI-I  score  =  1  or  2  as  last  post-
baseline  value)  was  48.0%  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group  and  48.9%  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg 
group  versus  44.6%  in  the  placebo  group  and  47.5%  in  the  fluoxetine  group  without  statistically 
significant difference. 
Children’s  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS):  In  the  FAS,  the  mean  CGAS  total  score  gradually 
increased with each visit between baseline and W012 to achieve a change from baseline to last post-
baseline value of 13.2 ± 11.3 in the agomelatine 10 mg group, 14.4 ± 13.0 in the agomelatine 25 mg 
group, 12.1 ± 14.0 in the placebo group and 13.9 ± 12.5 in the fluoxetine group. 
Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS): The means of ADRS total score of the last post-baseline 
value were 18.8 ± 10.1 in the agomelatine 10 mg group, 18.1 ± 10.6 in the agomelatine 25 mg group 
and 22.2 ± 10.7 in the placebo group. The difference of means between placebo and each agomelatine 
dose regimen was statistically significant in favour of agomelatine 10 mg with Student t-test (E (SE) = 
3.40  (1.65);  95%  CI  [0.14;  6.67],  p  =  0.041)  but  not  with  Mann-Whitney  test  (p  =  0.064)  and  in 
favour of agomelatine 25 mg with both statistical tests (E (SE) = 4.07 (1.72), 95% CI [0.68; 7.46], p 
=  0.019  and  0.032,  respectively).  The  difference  of  means  between  placebo  and  fluoxetine  were  not 
statistically significant. 
Some efficacy results – open extension period: 
Out of the 400 patients who were included in the study and randomly assigned to one of the 4 groups, 
339  patients  (analysis-set  called  Sub-MRS),  including  271  adolescents  (79.9%  of  the  patients), 
entered the optional open-label extension period, during which all received agomelatine at flexible dose 
(10 mg during the first 2 weeks and then 10 or 25 mg). Overall, 187 patients (55.2%) completed the 
W012-W104  extension  period,  with  a  similar  frequency  in  each  group.  Of  the  adolescents,  53.5% 
completed the W012-W104 period. The treatment duration over the extension period ranged between 
0.1 and 22.1 months with a mean of 15.5 ± 7.5 months. 
The table below summarises the values at baseline (W012), W024, W040, W052, W104 and last post-
baseline visit as well as the changes from baseline (W012) to each of these visits:

Considering only the patients  receiving  agomelatine  all  along  the  study, the mean CDRS-R raw 
total  score  decreased  along  the  W000-W104  period.  The  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  -29.5  ± 
14.0 at W024, -41.6 ± 12.6 at W104 and -38.8 ± 13.2 when considering the last post-baseline value. 
Focusing  on  adolescents,  efficacy  results  on  CDRS-R  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  total 
population during the W012-W104 period as well as during the W000-W104 period. 
Regarding  remission,  the  table  below  summarises  the  rates  of  patients  in  remission  at  baseline 
(W012), W024, W040, W052, W104 and last post-baseline visit:

Regarding hepatic safety, 4 patients (one child on agomelatine 10 mg, one adolescent on agomelatine 
25  mg  and  2  adolescents    on  fluoxetine)  reported  high  emergent  PCSA  values  (>  3  ULN)  of  ALAT 
and/or ASAT.  
Regarding suicidality, as evaluated by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), no signal 
was observed, according to the MAH. Few patients presented emergent suicidal ideations on treatment 
distributed  (one  patient  in  each  group).  Only  the  case  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group  concerned  a 
child (severity = 1). No emergent suicidal ideation was rated as serious (defined as score of 4 or 5). In 
addition,  a  total  of  7  patients  had  a  worsening  of  their  suicidal  ideation  on  treatment,  without 
meaningful difference between groups (2 patients and 1 patient in the agomelatine 10 mg and 25 mg, 
respectively  vs.  3  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  1  patient  in  the  fluoxetine  group).  No  child  was 
affected  by  these  aggravations.  One  patient  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg  group  and  one  in  the  placebo 
group  reported  emergent  self-injurious  behaviour  without  suicidal  intent  on  treatment.  A  suicide 
attempt was reported as a serious adverse event in one patient in the agomelatine 25 mg group. 
Some safety results – open extension period: 
In  the  extension  period  (W012-W104,  i.e.,  a  21-month  follow-up),  a  total  of  212  patients  (62.5%) 
presented 620 Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events under agomelatine: 61.8% of patients in the 
ago/ago group, 64.7% in the placebo/ago group and 61.9% in the fluox/ago group. Most events were 
rated as mild (68.9%) or moderate (26%), with more severe events in the placebo/ago group (12.9% 
of TEAEs) than in the ago/ago and fluox/ago groups (2.3% and 0.8% of TEAEs, respectively).

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  during  the  W012-W104  period  were  headache  (11.8%  of 
patients),  nasopharyngitis  (7.1%),  nausea  (5.3%),  weight  increased  and  decreased  appetite  (3.8% 
each), abdominal pain, blood prolactin increased, thirst and fatigue (3.5% each) and dizziness (3.2%), 
without relevant between-group differences. Similar results were observed in the adolescents (62.4% 
presenting TEAEs) with roughly the same most common TEAEs as in the total population. 
Overall,  8.6%  of  patients  presented  at  least  one  serious  TEAE  during  the  extension  period,  with  a 
higher  rate  in  the  placebo/ago  (14.1%)  and  fluox/ago  (10.7%)  groups  than  in  the  ago/ago  group 
(4.7%).  The  most  common  serious  TEAE  was  depression,  reported  in  4  patients.  Platelet  count 
decreased, pneumonia, syncope, ALAT increased, ASAT increased, and suicidal ideation were reported 
by 2 patients each. All other serious TEAEs were reported only once. No serious TEAE was considered 
as  related  to  IMP.  Ten  serious  TEAEs  in  6  patients  (1.8%)  led  to  IMP  withdrawal,  mainly  Psychiatric 
disorders. 
In the adolescents, 9.6% had serious TEAEs during the W012-W104 period. 
Regarding liver  acceptability, 3 patients (2 adolescents both in the placebo/ago group and one child 
in  the  fluox/ago  group)  reported  high  emergent  PCSA  values  [>  3  Upper  Limit  of  normal  laboratory 
reference  range  (ULN)]  of  ALAT  and/or  ASAT  on  treatment.  None  of  these  events  led  to  study 
withdrawal. 
Regarding suicidality, the analysis of suicide risk using the C-SSRS-C showed that 12 patients (3.6%) 
[3 patients in the ago/ago group, 4 patients in the placebo/ago group and 5 patients in the fluxo/ago 
group] presented emergent suicidal ideations on treatment during the W012-W104 period. In addition, 
one  patient  (adolescent  in  the  placebo/ago  group)  had  a  worsening  of  his/her  suicidal  ideation  on 
treatment. 
A  total  of  6  patients  (1.8%,  all  adolescents;  3  patients  in  the  ago/ago  group,  1  patient  in  the 
placebo/ago  group  and  2  patients  in  the  fluxo/ago  group)  reported  emergent  self-injurious  behaviour 
without  suicidal  intent  on  treatment.  Two  patients  (both  adolescents;  one  in  each  of  the  placebo/ago 
and fluxo/ago groups) presented 3 emergent suicidal behaviours: both made emergent actual suicide 
attempt  on  treatment;  in  addition,  one  of  them  also  undertook  emergent  preparatory  actions  toward 
imminent suicidal behaviour. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In this report only very brief and non-comprehensive information and summaries are given of the data 
from the submitted study CL3-20098-076.  
Furthermore,  the  data  from  the  study  have  not  been  critically  assessed  by  the  CHMP  in  this  Art.  46 
procedure.  This  is  because  the  MAH  intends  to  submit  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  Valdoxan 
comprising  the  paediatric  population,  based  on  data  from  study  CL3-20098-076,  by  the  end  of 
September  2022.  This  intention  was  notified  to  EMA  24th  March  2022.  Consequently,  the  critical 
assessment of the data from study CL3-20098-076 is deferred and will be made during the procedure 
for the extension of the indication for Valdoxan.  
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No critical assessment of the data from study CL3-20098-076 has been performed by the CHMP in the 
current Art. 46 procedure. This will rather be done later during the procedure for the extension of the 
indication  for  Valdoxan.  The  MAH  has  notified  EMA  (24th  March  2022)  that  they  intend  to  submit  an 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/627886/2022

application for extension of the indication by the end of September 2022. No changes are proposed in 
the SmPC in the present procedure. 
The  current  PAM  is  therefore  considered  fulfilled  solely  based  on  the  fact  that  the  study  data  have 
been  provided.  However,  this  conclusion  is  based  on  the  prerequisite  that  the  MAH  applies  for  an 
extension of the indication for Valdoxan within a reasonable time frame. Consequently, it is therefore 
expected that an application for extension of the indication for Valdoxan will be submitted by the MAH 
within the end of September 2022 (as has already been notified by the MAH to EMA in March 2022). 
  Fulfilled: 
No  further  action  required;  however,  the  data  are  expected  submitted  in  the  context  of  an  extension 
prior any conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH should commit to submit 
this  extension  application  by  the  end  of  September  2022  as  has  already  been  indicated  by  the  MAH 
and notified to EMA on 24th March 2022.

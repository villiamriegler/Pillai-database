SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR TRUVELOG MIX 30 
(INSULIN ASPART)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TRUVELOG MIX 30. The RMP 
details important risks of TRUVELOG MIX 30, how these risks can be minimized, and how 
more information will be obtained about TRUVELOG MIX 30’s risks and uncertainties 
(missing information). 
TRUVELOG MIX 30 summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet 
(PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how 
TRUVELOG MIX 30 should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for TRUVELOG MIX 30 should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
TRUVELOG MIX 30’s RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
TRUVELOG MIX 30 is proposed for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents 
and children aged 10 years and above. It contains soluble insulin 
aspart/protamine-crystallized insulin aspart as the active substance and it is injected by 
subcutaneous (SC) route.  
Further information about the evaluation of TRUVELOG MIX 30 benefits will be found in 
TRUVELOG MIX 30’s EPAR, including the plain-language summary, available on the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of TRUVELOG MIX 30, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about TRUVELOG MIX 30 risks, are outlined in the 
next sections. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed-including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessments so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of TRUVELOG MIX 30 are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as either identified or potential risks. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
TRUVELOG MIX 30. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term 
use of the medicine);

I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
INSULIN ASPART SANOFI is authorized for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 1 year and above (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
insulin aspart as the active substance and it is injected by subcutaneous (SC) route. INSULIN 
ASPART SANOFI can also be used for continuous SC insulin infusion and can be given 
intravenously (IV) by HCPs.

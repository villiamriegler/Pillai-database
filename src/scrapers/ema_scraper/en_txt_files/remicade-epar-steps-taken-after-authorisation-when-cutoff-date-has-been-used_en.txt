Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2309/93 as amended and Part 4G of 
Annex to Council Directive 75/318/EEC, the MAH submitted to the EMEA on 31 October 2000 
additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  as  stated  in  Annex  IIC  to  Commission  Decision,  which 
formed the basis of the 1st annual re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Remicade (results 
from ACCENT I and ACCENT II clinical trials, new safety data). The procedure started on 26 
January 2001. During the procedure, following the submission and the assessment of the second 
periodic safety update report (PSUR) for Remicade covering the period from 24 August 1998 to 
23 August 2000, the CPMP decided during its February meeting to perform a full reassessment 
of  the  safety  profile  of  Remicade  in  both  indications  in  the  framework  of  the  annual 
reassessment  procedure.  On  29  March  2001,  the  CPMP  agreed  that  the  risk/benefit  profile  of 
Remicade remained favourable and that the MA should remain under exceptional circumstances 
until all the specific obligations are fulfilled. During this meeting the CPMP adopted an opinion 
on the annual re-assessment of the specific obligations and the risk/benefit ratio, stating that no 
amendments of Annexes I and III to the Community Marketing Authorisation were necessary. 
The  Annex  II  has  been  updated.  Corresponding  Commission  Decision  was  issued  on  31  July 
2001.

Summary of risk management plan for Thiotepa Riemser (thiotepa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Thiotepa Riemser. The RMP 
details important risks of Thiotepa Riemser. 
Thiotepa Riemser's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Thiotepa Riemser 
should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Thiotepa Riemser should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Thiotepa 
Riemser's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Thiotepa Riemser is authorised in combination with other chemotherapy medicinal products: 
  with or without total body irradiation (TBI), as conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic 
or autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in haematological 
diseases in adult and paediatric patients; 
  when high dose chemotherapy with HPCT support is appropriate for the treatment of solid 
tumours in adult and paediatric patients. 
 (see SmPC for the full indication).  
It contains thiotepa as the active substance and it is given by infusion.  
Further information about the evaluation of Thiotepa Riemser’s benefits can be found in 
Thiotepa Riemser’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/thiotepa-riemser.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Thiotepa Riemser together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
In  addition to these measures, information about  adverse reactions is collected  continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Thiotepa Riemser is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Thiotepa Riemser are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Thiotepa Riemser. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product 
that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

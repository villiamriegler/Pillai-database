CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tyverb is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with breast cancer, whose tumours overexpress 
HER2 (ErbB2); 
• 
• 
• 
in combination with capecitabine for patients with advanced or metastatic disease with 
progression following prior therapy, which must have included anthracyclines and taxanes and 
therapy with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting (see section 5.1). 
in combination with trastuzumab for patients with hormone receptor-negative metastatic disease 
that has progressed on prior trastuzumab therapy(ies) in combination with chemotherapy (see 
section 5.1). 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor 
positive metastatic disease, not currently intended for chemotherapy. The patients in the 
registration study were not previously treated with trastuzumab or an aromatase inhibitor (see 
sections 4.4. and 5.1). No data are available on the efficacy of this combination relative to 
trastuzumab in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in this patient population. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Tyverb treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of 
anti-cancer medicinal products. 
HER2 (ErbB2) overexpressing tumours are defined by IHC3+, or IHC2+ with gene amplification or 
gene amplification alone. HER2 status should be determined using accurate and validated methods. 
Posology 
Tyverb / capecitabine combination posology 
The recommended dose of Tyverb is 1250 mg (i.e. five tablets) once daily continuously. 
The recommended dose of capecitabine is 2000 mg/m2/day taken in 2 doses 12 hours apart on 
days 1-14 in a 21 day cycle (see section 5.1). Capecitabine should be taken with food or within 
30 minutes after food. Please refer to the full prescribing information of capecitabine.

Tyverb / trastuzumab combination posology 
The recommended dose of Tyverb is 1000 mg (i.e. four tablets) once daily continuously. 
The recommended dose of trastuzumab is 4 mg/kg administered as an intravenous loading dose, 
followed by 2 mg/kg intravenous weekly (see section 5.1). Please refer to the full prescribing 
information of trastuzumab. 
Tyverb / aromatase inhibitor combination posology 
The recommended dose of Tyverb is 1500 mg (i.e. six tablets) once daily continuously. 
Please refer to the full prescribing information of the co-administered aromatase inhibitor for dosing 
details. 
Dose delay and dose reduction 
Cardiac events 
Tyverb should be discontinued in patients with symptoms associated with decreased left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) that are National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI CTCAE) grade 3 or greater or if their LVEF drops below the institutions lower limit of 
normal (see section 4.4). Tyverb may be restarted at a reduced dose (750 mg/day when administered 
with trastuzumab, 1000 mg/day when administered with capecitabine or 1250 mg/day when 
administered with an aromatase inhibitor) after a minimum of 2 weeks and if the LVEF recovers to 
normal and the patient is asymptomatic. 
Interstitial lung disease / pneumonitis 
Tyverb should be discontinued in patients who experience pulmonary symptoms which are NCI 
CTCAE grade 3 or greater (see section 4.4). 
Diarrhoea 
Tyverb dosing should be interrupted in patients with diarrhoea which is NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 
grade 1 or 2 with complicating features (moderate to severe abdominal cramping, nausea or vomiting 
greater than or equal to NCI CTCAE grade 2, decreased performance status, fever, sepsis, neutropenia, 
frank bleeding or dehydration) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Tyverb may be reintroduced at a lower dose 
(reduced from 1000 mg/day to 750 mg/day, from 1250 mg/day to 1000 mg/day or from 1500 mg/day 
to 1250 mg/day) when diarrhoea resolves to grade 1 or less. Tyverb dosing should be permanently 
discontinued in patients with diarrhoea which is NCI CTCAE grade 4. 
Other toxicities 
Discontinuation or interruption of dosing with Tyverb may be considered when a patient develops 
toxicity greater than or equal to grade 2 on the NCI CTCAE. Dosing can be restarted, when the 
toxicity improves to grade 1 or less, at 1000 mg/day when administered with trastuzumab, 
1250 mg/day when administered with capecitabine or 1500 mg/day when administered with an 
aromatase inhibitor. If the toxicity recurs, then Tyverb should be restarted at a lower dose (750 mg/day 
when administered with trastuzumab, 1000 mg/day when administered with capecitabine or 
1250 mg/day when administered with an aromatase inhibitor).

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is 
advised in patients with severe renal impairment as there is no experience of Tyverb in this population 
(see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Tyverb should be discontinued if changes in liver function are severe and patients should not be 
retreated (see section 4.4). 
Administration of Tyverb to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment should be 
undertaken with caution due to increased exposure to the medicinal product. Insufficient data are 
available in patients with hepatic impairment to provide a dose adjustment recommendation (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly 
There are limited data on the use of Tyverb / capecitabine and Tyverb / trastuzumab in patients aged 
≥ 65 years. 
In the phase III clinical study of Tyverb in combination with letrozole, of the total number of hormone 
receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patients (Intent to treat population N= 642), 44 % were 
≥ 65 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy and safety of the combination of Tyverb and 
letrozole were observed between these patients and patients < 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tyverb in children below the age of 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Tyverb is for oral use. 
The daily dose of Tyverb should not be divided. Tyverb should be taken either at least one hour 
before, or at least one hour after food. To minimise variability in the individual patient, administration 
of Tyverb should be standardised in relation to food intake, for example always to be taken one hour 
before a meal (see sections 4.5 and 5.2 for information on absorption). 
Missed doses should not be replaced and the dosing should resume with the next scheduled daily dose 
(see section 4.9). 
The full prescribing information of the co-administered medicinal product should be consulted for 
relevant details of their posology including any dose reductions, contraindications and safety 
information. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Data have shown that Tyverb combined with chemotherapy is less effective than trastuzumab when 
combined with chemotherapy.

Cardiac toxicity 
Lapatinib has been associated with reports of decreases in LVEF (see section 4.8). Lapatinib has not 
been evaluated in patients with symptomatic cardiac failure. Caution should be taken if Tyverb is to be 
administered to patients with conditions that could impair left ventricular function (including co-
administration with potentially cardiotoxic medicinal products). Evaluation of cardiac function, 
including LVEF determination, should be conducted for all patients prior to initiation of treatment 
with Tyverb to ensure that the patient has a baseline LVEF that is within the institutions normal limits. 
LVEF should continue to be evaluated during treatment with Tyverb to ensure that LVEF does not 
decline to an unacceptable level (see section 4.2). In some cases, LVEF decrease may be severe and 
lead to cardiac failure. Fatal cases have been reported, causality of the deaths is uncertain. In studies 
across the clinical development programme for lapatinib, cardiac events including LVEF decreases 
were reported in approximately 1% of patients. Symptomatic LVEF decreases were observed in 
approximately 0.3% of patients who received lapatinib. However, when lapatinib was administered in 
combination with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting, the incidence of cardiac events including 
LVEF decreases was higher (7%) versus the lapatinib alone arm (2%) in the pivotal trial. The cardiac 
events observed in this study were comparable in nature and severity to those previously seen with 
lapatinib. 
A concentration-dependent increase of the QTc interval was demonstrated in a dedicated 
placebo-controlled crossover study in subjects with advanced solid tumours. 
Caution should be taken if Tyverb is administered to patients with conditions that could result in 
prolongation of QTc (including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and congenital long QT syndrome), 
co-administration of other medicinal product known to cause QT prolongation, or conditions that 
increase the exposure of lapatinib, such as co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to treatment. Electrocardiograms with QT 
measurement should be performed prior to and one to two weeks after the start of Tyverb therapy. 
When clinically indicated, e.g. after initiation of a concomitant treatment that might affect QT or that 
may interact with lapatinib, ECG measurement should also be considered. 
Interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis 
Lapatinib has been associated with reports of pulmonary toxicity including interstitial lung disease and 
pneumonitis (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for symptoms of pulmonary toxicity 
(dyspnoea, cough, fever) and treatment discontinued in patients who experience symptoms which are 
NCI CTCAE grade 3 or greater. Pulmonary toxicity may be severe and lead to respiratory failure. 
Fatal cases have been reported, causality of the deaths is uncertain. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity has occurred with Tyverb use and may in rare cases be fatal. The hepatotoxicity may 
occur days to several months after initiation of treatment. At the initiation of treatment, patients should 
be advised of the potential for hepatotoxicity. Liver function (transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline 
phosphatase) should be monitored before the initiation of treatment and monthly thereafter, or as 
clinically indicated. Tyverb dosing should be discontinued if changes in liver function are severe and 
patients should not be retreated. Patients who carry the HLA alleles DQA1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01 
have increased risk of Tyverb-associated hepatotoxicity. In a large, randomised clinical trial of Tyverb 
monotherapy (n=1,194), the cumulative frequency of severe liver injury (ALT >5 times the upper limit 
of normal, NCI CTCAE grade 3) at 1 year of treatment was 2.8% overall. The cumulative frequency in 
DQA1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01 allele carriers was 10.3% and in non-carriers was 0.5%. Carriage of 
the HLA risk alleles is common (15 to 25%) in Caucasian, Asian, African and Hispanic populations 
but lower (1%) in Japanese populations. 
Caution is warranted if Tyverb is prescribed to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
and to patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been reported with Tyverb treatment (see section 4.8). 
Diarrhoea can be potentially life-threatening if accompanied by dehydration, renal insufficiency, 
neutropenia and/or electrolyte imbalances and fatal cases have been reported. Diarrhoea generally 
occurs early during Tyverb treatment, with almost half of those patients with diarrhoea first 
experiencing it within 6 days. This usually lasts 4-5 days. Tyverb-induced diarrhoea is usually 
low-grade, with severe diarrhoea of NCI CTCAE grades 3 and 4 occurring in <10% and <1% of 
patients, respectively. At the start of therapy, the patients bowel pattern and any other symptoms (e.g. 
fever, cramping pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and thirst) should be determined, to allow 
identification of changes during treatment and to help identify patients at greater risk of diarrhoea. 
Patients should be instructed to promptly report any change in bowel patterns. In potentially severe 
cases of diarrhoea the measuring of neutrophil counts and body temperature should be considered. 
Proactive management of diarrhoea with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product is important. Severe cases 
of diarrhoea may require administration of oral or intravenous electrolytes and fluids, use of 
antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (especially if diarrhoea is persistent beyond 24 hours, there is 
fever, or grade 3 or 4 neutropenia) and interruption or discontinuation of Tyverb therapy (see 
section 4.2 – dose delay and dose reduction –diarrhoea). 
Serious cutaneous reactions 
Serious cutaneous reactions have been reported with Tyverb. If erythema multiforme or 
life-threatening reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis (e.g. 
progressive skin rash often with blisters or mucosal lesions) are suspected, discontinue treatment with 
Tyverb. 
Concomitant treatment with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 
Concomitant treatment with inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided due to risk of decreased exposure 
to lapatinib (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided due to risk of increased 
exposure to lapatinib (see section 4.5). 
Grapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with Tyverb (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of Tyverb with orally administered medicinal products with narrow therapeutic 
windows that are substrates of CYP3A4 and /or CYP2C8 should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant treatment with substances that increase gastric pH should be avoided, as lapatinib 
solubility and absorption may decrease (see section 4.5). 
Tyverb contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on lapatinib 
Lapatinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A (see section 5.2). 
In healthy volunteers receiving ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 200 mg twice daily for 
7 days, systemic exposure to lapatinib (100 mg daily) was increased approximately 3.6–fold, and 
half-life increased 1.7–fold. Co-administration of Tyverb with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, 
nefazodone) should be avoided. Co-administration of Tyverb with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 
should proceed with caution and clinical adverse reactions should be carefully monitored. 
In healthy volunteers receiving carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, at 100 mg twice daily for 3 days 
and 200 mg twice daily for 17 days, systemic exposure to lapatinib was decreased approximately 72%. 
Co-administration of Tyverb with known inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin or Hypericum perforatum [St John’s Wort]) should be avoided. 
Lapatinib is a substrate for the transport proteins Pgp and BCRP. Inhibitors (ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, quinidine, verapamil, cyclosporine, and erythromycin) and inducers (rifampicin and St 
John’s Wort) of these proteins may alter the exposure and/or distribution of lapatinib (see section 5.2). 
The solubility of lapatinib is pH-dependent. Concomitant treatment with substances that increase 
gastric pH should be avoided, as lapatinib solubility and absorption may decrease. Pre-treatment with 
a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) decreased lapatinib exposure by an average of 27% (range: 
6% to 49%). This effect decreases with increasing age from approximately 40 to 60 years. 
Effects of lapatinib on other medicinal products 
Lapatinib inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Co-administration of Tyverb 
with orally administered midazolam resulted in an approximate 45% increase in the AUC of 
midazolam. There was no clinically meaningful increase in AUC when midazolam was dosed 
intravenously. Co-administration of Tyverb with orally administered medicinal products with narrow 
therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g. cisapride, pimozide and quinidine) should be 
avoided (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Lapatinib inhibits CYP2C8 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Co-administration of Tyverb 
with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP2C8 (e.g. 
repaglinide) should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Co-administration of lapatinib with intravenous paclitaxel increased the exposure of paclitaxel by 
23%, due to lapatinib inhibition of CYP2C8 and/or Pgp. An increase in the incidence and severity of 
diarrhoea and neutropenia has been observed with this combination in clinical studies. Caution is 
advised if lapatinib is co-administered with paclitaxel. 
Co-administration of lapatinib with intravenously administered docetaxel did not significantly affect 
the AUC or Cmax of either active substance. However, the occurrence of docetaxel-induced neutropenia 
was increased. 
Co-administration of Tyverb with irinotecan (when administered as part of the FOLFIRI regimen) 
resulted in an approximate 40% increase in the AUC of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. 
The precise mechanism of this interaction is unknown, but it is assumed to be due to inhibition of one 
or more transport proteins by lapatinib. Adverse reactions should be carefully monitored if Tyverb is 
co-administered with irinotecan, and a reduction in the dose of irinotecan should be considered. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lapatinib inhibits the transport protein Pgp in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Co-administration of lapatinib with orally administered digoxin resulted in an approximate 80% 
increase in the AUC of digoxin. Caution should be exercised when dosing lapatinib concurrently with 
medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of Pgp, and a reduction in the 
dose of the Pgp substrate should be considered. 
Lapatinib inhibits the transport proteins BCRP and OATP1B1 in vitro. The clinical relevance of this 
effect has not been evaluated. It cannot be excluded that lapatinib will affect the pharmacokinetics of 
substrates of BCRP (e.g. topotecan) and OATP1B1 (e.g. rosuvastatin) (see section 5.2). 
Concomitant administration of Tyverb with capecitabine, letrozole or trastuzumab did not 
meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products (or the metabolites of 
capecitabine) or lapatinib. 
Interactions with food and drink 
The bioavailability of lapatinib is increased up to about 4 times by food, depending on e.g. the fat 
content in the meal. Furthermore, depending on type of food the bioavailability is approximately 
2-3 times higher when lapatinib is taken 1 hour after food compared with 1 hour before the first meal 
of the day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Grapefruit juice may inhibit CYP3A4 in the gut wall and increase the bioavailability of lapatinib and 
should therefore be avoided during treatment with Tyverb. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception and avoid becoming 
pregnant while receiving treatment with Tyverb and for at least 5 days after the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Tyverb in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is not known. 
Tyverb should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
The safe use of Tyverb during breast-feeding has not been established. It is not known whether 
lapatinib is excreted in human milk. In rats, growth retardation was observed in pups which were 
exposed to lapatinib via breast milk. Breast-feeding must be discontinued in women who are receiving 
therapy with Tyverb and for at least 5 days after the last dose. 
Fertility 
There are no adequate data from the use of Tyverb in women of childbearing potential. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tyverb has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. A detrimental effect on such 
activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of lapatinib. The clinical status of the patient and 
the safety profile of lapatinib should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to perform 
tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of lapatinib has been evaluated as monotherapy or in combination with other 
chemotherapies for various cancers in more than 20,000 patients, including 198 patients who received 
lapatinib in combination with capecitabine, 149 patients who received lapatinib in combination with 
trastuzumab and 654 patients who received lapatinib in combination with letrozole (see section 5.1). 
The most common adverse reactions (>25%) during therapy with lapatinib were gastrointestinal events 
(such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting) and rash. Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was also 
common (>25%) when lapatinib was administered in combination with capecitabine. The incidence of 
PPE was similar in the lapatinib plus capecitabine and capecitabine alone treatment arms. Diarrhoea 
was the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of treatment when lapatinib was 
administered in combination with capecitabine, or with letrozole. 
No additional adverse reactions were reported to be associated with lapatinib in combination with 
trastuzumab. There was an increased incidence of cardiac toxicity, but these events were comparable 
in nature and severity to those reported from the lapatinib clinical programme (see section 4.4 – 
cardiac toxicity). These data are based on exposure to this combination in 149 patients in the pivotal 
trial. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported to have a causal association with lapatinib alone 
or lapatinib in combination with capecitabine, trastuzumab or letrozole. 
The following convention has been utilised for the classification of frequency: very common ((1/10), 
common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very

**  Adverse reactions from spontaneous reports and literature 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and QT interval prolongation 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreases have been reported in approximately 1% of 
patients receiving lapatinib and were asymptomatic in more than 70% of cases. LVEF decreases 
resolved or improved in more than 70 % of cases, in approximately 60 % of these on discontinuation 
of treatment with lapatinib, and in approximately 40 % of cases lapatinib was continued. Symptomatic 
LVEF decreases were observed in approximately 0.3% of patients who received lapatinib 
monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer medicinal products. Observed adverse reactions 
included dyspnoea, cardiac failure and palpitations. Overall 58 % of these symptomatic patients 
recovered. LVEF decreases were reported in 2.5 % of patients who received lapatinib in combination 
with capecitabine, as compared to 1.0 % with capecitabine alone. LVEF decreases were reported in 
3.1 % of patients who received lapatinib in combination with letrozole as compared to 1.3 % of 
patients receiving letrozole plus placebo. LVEF decreases were reported in 6.7 % of patients who 
received lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab, as compared to 2.1 % of patients who received 
lapatinib alone. 
A concentration dependent increase in QTcF (maximum mean ΔΔQTcF 8.75 ms; 90% CI 4.08, 13.42) 
was observed in a dedicated QT study in patients with advanced solid tumours (see section 4.4). 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea occurred in approximately 65 % of patients who received lapatinib in combination with 
capecitabine, in 64 % of patients who received lapatinib in combination with letrozole and in 62 % of 
patients who received lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab. Most cases of diarrhoea were 
grade 1 or 2 and did not result in discontinuation of treatment with lapatinib. Diarrhoea responds well 
to proactive management (see section 4.4). However, a few cases of acute renal failure have been 
reported secondary to severe dehydration due to diarrhoea. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rash 
Rash occurred in approximately 28 % of patients who received lapatinib in combination with 
capecitabine, in 45 % of patients who received lapatinib in combination with letrozole and in 23 % of 
patients who received lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab. Rash was generally low grade and 
did not result in discontinuation of treatment with lapatinib. Prescribing physicians are advised to 
perform a skin examination prior to treatment and regularly during treatment. Patients experiencing 
skin reactions should be encouraged to avoid exposure to sunlight and apply broad spectrum 
sunscreens with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF)  30. If a skin reaction occurs a full body examination 
should be performed at every visit until one month after resolution. Patients with extensive or 
persistent skin reactions should be referred to a dermatologist. 
Hepatotoxicity 
The risk of lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity was associated with carriage of the HLA alleles 
DQA1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01 (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific antidote for the inhibition of EGFR (ErbB1) and/or HER2 (ErbB2) tyrosine 
phosphorylation. The maximum oral dose of lapatinib that has been administered in clinical studies is 
1800 mg once daily. 
Asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of overdose have been reported in patients being treated with 
Tyverb. In patients who took up to 5000 mg of lapatinib, symptoms observed include known lapatinib 
associated events (see section 4.8) and in some cases sore scalp and/or mucosal inflammation. In a 
single case of a patient who took 9000 mg of Tyverb, sinus tachycardia (with otherwise normal ECG) 
was also observed. 
Lapatinib is not significantly renally excreted and is highly bound to plasma proteins, therefore 
haemodialysis would not be expected to be an effective method to enhance the elimination of 
lapatinib. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EH01. 
Mechanism of action 
Lapatinib, a 4-anilinoquinazoline, is an inhibitor of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of both 
EGFR (ErbB1) and of HER2 (ErbB2) receptors (estimated Kiapp values of 3nM and 13nM, 
respectively) with a slow off-rate from these receptors (half-life greater than or equal to 300 minutes). 
Lapatinib inhibits ErbB-driven tumour cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. 
The combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab may offer complementary mechanisms of action as well 
as possible non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance. The growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib were 
evaluated in trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against 
HER2-amplified breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in trastuzumab-containing 
medium in vitro and was synergistic in combination with trastuzumab in these cell lines. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Combination treatment with Tyverb and capecitabine 
The efficacy and safety of Tyverb in combination with capecitabine in breast cancer patients with 
good performance status was evaluated in a randomised, phase III study. Patients eligible for 
enrolment had HER2-overexpressing, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, progressing after 
prior treatment that included taxanes, anthracyclines and trastuzumab. LVEF was evaluated in all 
patients (using echocardiogram [Echo] or multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA]) prior to initiation of 
treatment with Tyverb to ensure baseline LVEF was within the institutions normal limits. In the 
clinical study LVEF was monitored at approximately eight week intervals during treatment with 
Tyverb to ensure it did not decline to below the institutions lower limit of normal. The majority of 
LVEF decreases (greater than 60 % of events) were observed during the first nine weeks of treatment, 
however limited data was available for long term exposure. 
Patients were randomised to receive either Tyverb 1250 mg once daily (continuously) plus 
capecitabine (2000 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 every 21 days), or to receive capecitabine alone 
(2500 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 every 21 days). The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP). 
Assessments were undertaken by the study investigators and by an independent review panel, blinded 
to treatment. The study was halted based on the results of a pre-specified interim analysis that showed 
an improvement in TTP for patients receiving Tyverb plus capecitabine. An additional 75 patients 
were enrolled in the study between the time of the interim analysis and the end of the enrolment. 
Investigator analysis on data at the end of enrolment is presented in Table 1.

The independent assessment of the data also demonstrated that Tyverb when given in combination 
with capecitabine significantly increased time to progression (Hazard Ratio 0.57 [95 % CI 0.43, 0.77] 
p=0.0001) compared to capecitabine alone.

On the combination arm, there were 4 (2%) progressions in the central nervous system as compared 
with the 13 (6%) progressions on the capecitabine alone arm. 
Data are available on the efficacy and safety of Tyverb in combination with capecitabine relative to 
trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine. A randomised Phase III study (EGF111438) (N=540) 
compared the effect of the two regimens on the incidence of CNS as site of first relapse in women with 
HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomised to either Tyverb 1250 mg 
once daily (continuously) plus capecitabine (2000 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 every 21 days), or 
trastuzumab (loading dose of 8mg/kg followed by 6mg/kg q3 weekly infusions) plus capecitabine 
(2500mg/m2/day, days 1-14, every 21 days). Randomisation was stratified by prior trastuzumab 
treatment and number of prior treatments for metastatic disease. The study was halted as the interim 
analysis (N=475) showed a low incidence of CNS events and, superior efficacy of the trastuzumab 
plus capecitabine arm in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival (see results of final 
analysis in Table 3). 
In the Tyverb plus capecitabine arm 8 patients (3.2%) experienced CNS as site of first progression, 
compared with 12 patients (4.8%) in the trastuzumab plus capecitabine arm.

Lapatinib effect on CNS metastasis 
Lapatinib has in terms of objective responses demonstrated modest activity in the treatment of 
established CNS metastases. In the prevention of CNS metastases in the metastatic and early breast 
cancer settings the observed activity was limited.

Combination treatment with Tyverb and trastuzumab 
The efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer were 
evaluated in a randomised trial. Eligible patients were women with Stage IV ErbB2 gene amplified (or 
protein overexpressing) metastatic breast cancer who had been exposed to treatment with 
anthracyclines and taxanes. In addition, per the protocol, patients were to be reported by the 
investigators as having progressed on their most recent trastuzumab containing regimen in the 
metastatic setting. The median number of prior trastuzumab-containing regimens was three. Patients 
were randomised to receive either oral lapatinib 1000 mg once daily plus trastuzumab 4 mg/kg 
administered as an intravenousloading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg intravenous weekly (N = 148), or 
oral lapatinib 1500 mg once daily (N = 148). Patients who had objective disease progression after 
receiving at least 4 weeks of treatment with lapatinib monotherapy were eligible to crossover to 
combination therapy. Of the 148 patients who received monotherapy treatment, 77 (52%) patients 
elected at the time of disease progression to receive combination treatment. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint of the study with response rate and overall 
survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. The median age was 51 years and 13% were 65 years or older. 
Ninety-four percent (94%) were Caucasian. Most patients in both treatment arms had visceral disease 
(215 [73%] patients overall). In addition, 150 [50%] of patients were hormone receptor negative. A 
summary of efficacy endpoints and overall survival data is provided in Table 4. Subgroup analysis 
results based on predefined stratification factor (hormone receptor status) is also shown in Table 5.

Combination treatment with Tyverb and letrozole 
Tyverb has been studied in combination with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor-positive (oestrogen receptor [ER] positive and / or progesterone receptor [PgR] 
positive) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
The Phase III study (EGF30008) was randomised, double-blind, and placebo controlled. The study 
enrolled patients who had not received prior therapy for their metastatic disease. 
In the HER2-overexpressing population, only 2 patients were enrolled who had received prior 
trastuzumab, 2 patients had received prior aromatase inhibitor therapy, and approximately half had 
received tamoxifen. 
Patients were randomised to letrozole 2.5 mg once daily plus Tyverb 1500 mg once daily or letrozole 
with placebo. Randomisation was stratified by sites of disease and by time from discontinuation of 
prior adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy. HER2 receptor status was retrospectively determined by central 
laboratory testing. Of all patients randomised to treatment, 219 patients had tumours overexpressing 
the HER2 receptor, and this was the pre-specified primary population for the analysis of efficacy. 
There were 952 patients with HER2-negative tumours, and a total of 115 patients whose tumour HER2 
status was unconfirmed (no tumour sample, no assay result, or other reason). 
In patients with HER2-overexpressing MBC, investigator-determined progression-free survival (PFS) 
was significantly greater with letrozole plus Tyverb compared with letrozole plus placebo. In the 
HER2-negative population, there was no benefit in PFS when letrozole plus Tyverb was compared 
with letrozole plus placebo (see Table 6).

At the time of the final PFS analysis (with median follow-up of 2.64 years), the overall survival data 
were not mature and there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the 
HER2-positive population; this had not changed with additional follow-up (>7.5 years median follow-
up time; Table 7).

Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of lapatinib on the QT-interval was evaluated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, single 
sequence (placebo and active treatment) crossover study in patients with advanced solid tumours 
(EGF114271) (n=58). During the 4-day treatment period, three doses of matching placebo were 
administered 12 hours apart in the morning and evening on Day 1 and in the morning on Day 2. This 
was followed by three doses of lapatinib 2000 mg administered in the same way. Measurements, 
including electrocardiograms (ECGs) and pharmacokinetic samples, were taken at baseline and at the 
same time points on Day 2 and Day 4. 
In the evaluable population (n=37), the maximum mean ΔΔQTcF (90% CI) of 8.75 ms (4.08, 13.42) 
was observed 10 hours after ingestion of the third dose of lapatinib 2000 mg. The ΔΔQTcF exceeded 
the 5 ms threshold and the upper bound 90% CIs exceeded the 10 ms threshold at multiple time points. 
The results for the pharmacodynamics population (n=52) were consistent with those from the 
evaluable population (maximum ΔΔQTcF (90% CI) of 7.91 ms (4.13, 11.68) observed 10 hours after 
ingestion of the third dose of lapatinib 2000 mg). 
There is a positive relationship between lapatinib plasma concentrations and ΔΔQTcF. Lapatinib 
produced a maximum mean concentration of 3920 (3450-4460) ng/ml (geometric mean/95% CI), 
exceeding the geometric mean Cmax.ss and 95% CI values observed following the approved dosing 
regimens. An additional increase in peak exposure of lapatinib can be expected when lapatinib is taken 
repeatedly with food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) or concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
When lapatinib is taken in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors the QTc interval can be 
expected to be prolonged by 16.1 ms (12.6-20.3 ms) as demonstrated in a model-based prediction (see 
section 4.4). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Food effects on lapatinib exposure 
The bioavailability and thereby the plasma concentrations of lapatinib are increased by food, in 
relation to the content and timing of the meal. Dosing of lapatinib one hour after a meal results in 
approximately 2-3 times higher systemic exposure, compared to dosing one hour before a meal (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tyverb in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of breast carcinoma (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability following oral administration of lapatinib is unknown, but it is incomplete 
and variable (approximately 70% coefficient of variation in AUC). Serum concentrations appear after 
a median lag time of 0.25 hours (range 0 to 1.5 hours). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lapatinib 
are achieved approximately 4 hours after administration. Daily dosing of 1250 mg produces steady 
state geometric mean (coefficient of variation) Cmax values of 2.43 (76%) µg/ml and AUC values of 
36.2 (79%) µg*hr/ml. 
Systemic exposure to lapatinib is increased when administered with food. Lapatinib AUC values were 
approximately 3- and 4-fold higher (Cmax approximately 2.5 and 3–fold higher) when administered 
with a low fat (5% fat [500 calories]) or with a high fat (50% fat [1,000 calories]) meal, respectively, 
as compared with administration in the fasted state. Systemic exposure to lapatinib is also affected by 
the timing of administration in relation to food intake. Relative to dosing 1 hour before a low fat 
breakfast, mean AUC values were approximately 2- and 3-fold higher when lapatinib was 
administered 1 hour after a low fat or high fat meal, respectively. 
Distribution 
Lapatinib is highly bound (greater than 99%) to albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. In vitro 
studies indicate that lapatinib is a substrate for the transporters BCRP (ABCG1) and p-glycoprotein 
(ABCB1). Lapatinib has also been shown in vitro to inhibit these efflux transporters, as well as the 
hepatic uptake transporter OATP 1B1, at clinically relevant concentrations (IC50 values were equal to 
2.3 µg/ml). The clinical significance of these effects on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal 
products or the pharmacological activity of other anti-cancer medicinal products is not known. 
Biotransformation 
Lapatinib undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with minor 
contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2C8 to a variety of oxidated metabolites, none of which 
account for more than 14% of the dose recovered in the faeces or 10% of lapatinib concentration in 
plasma. 
Lapatinib inhibits CYP3A (Ki 0.6 to 2.3 µg/ml) and CYP2C8 (0.3 µg/ml) in vitro at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Lapatinib did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver 
microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 or UGT enzymes (in vitro IC50 values were 
greater than or equal to 6.9 µg/ml). 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
The half-life of lapatinib measured after single doses increases with increasing dose. However, daily 
dosing of lapatinib results in achievement of steady state within 6 to 7 days, indicating an effective 
half-life of 24 hours. Lapatinib is predominantly eliminated through metabolism by CYP3A4/5. 
Biliary excretion may also contribute to the elimination. The primary route of excretion for lapatinib 
and its metabolites is in faeces. Recovery of unchanged lapatinib in faeces accounts for a median 27% 
(range 3 to 67%) of an oral dose. Less than 2% of the administered oral dose (as lapatinib and 
metabolites) excreted in urine. 
Renal impairment 
Lapatinib pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in patients with renal impairment or in 
patients undergoing haemodialysis. Available data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lapatinib were examined in patients with moderate (n = 8) or severe (n = 4) 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores of 7-9, or greater than 9, respectively) and in 8 healthy control 
patients. Systemic exposure (AUC) to lapatinib after a single oral 100 mg dose increased 
approximately 56% and 85% in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. 
Administration of lapatinib in patients with hepatic impairment should be undertaken with caution (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Lapatinib was studied in pregnant rats and rabbits given oral doses of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day. 
There were no teratogenic effects; however, minor anomalies (left-sided umbilical artery, cervical rib 
and precocious ossification) occurred in rats at ≥60 mg/kg/day (4 times the expected human clinical 
exposure). In rabbits, lapatinib was associated with maternal toxicity at 60 and 120 mg/kg/day (8% 
and 23% of the expected human clinical exposure, respectively) and abortions at 120 mg/kg/day. At 
≥60 mg/kg/day there were decreased foetal body weights, and minor skeletal variations. In the rat pre- 
and postnatal development study, a decrease in pup survival occurred between birth and postnatal 
day 21 at doses of 60 mg/kg/day or higher (5 times the expected human clinical exposure). The highest 
no-effect dose for this study was 20 mg/kg/day. 
In oral carcinogenicity studies with lapatinib, severe skin lesions were seen at the highest doses tested 
which produced exposures based on AUC up to 2-fold in mice and male rats, and up to 15-fold in 
female rats, compared to humans given 1250 mg of lapatinib once daily. There was no evidence of 
carcinogenicity in mice. In rats, the incidence of benign haemangioma of the mesenteric lymph nodes 
was higher in some groups than in concurrent controls. There was also an increase in renal infarcts and 
papillary necrosis in female rats at exposures 7 and 10-fold compared to humans given 1250 mg of 
lapatinib once daily. The relevance of these findings for humans is uncertain. 
There were no effects on male or female rat gonadal function, mating, or fertility at doses up to 
120 mg/kg/day (females) and up to 180 mg/kg/day (males) (8 and 3 times the expected human clinical 
exposure, respectively). The effect on human fertility is unknown. 
Lapatinib was not clastogenic or mutagenic in a battery of assays including the Chinese hamster 
chromosome aberration assay, the Ames assay, human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tyverb is and what it is used for 
Tyverb is used to treat certain types of breast cancer (HER2-overexpressing) which have spread 
beyond the original tumour or to other organs (advanced or metastatic breast cancer). It may slow or 
stop cancer cells from growing, or may kill them. 
Tyverb is prescribed to be taken in combination with another anti-cancer medicine. 
Tyverb is prescribed in combination with capecitabine, for patients who have had treatment for 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer before. This previous treatment for metastatic breast cancer must 
have included trastuzumab. 
Tyverb is prescribed in combination with trastuzumab, for patients who have hormone receptor-
negative metastatic breast cancer and have had other treatment for advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer before. 
Tyverb is prescribed in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, for patients with hormone 
sensitive metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that is more likely to grow in the presence of 
hormones), who are not currently intended for chemotherapy. 
Information about these medicines is described in separate patient information leaflets. Ask your 
doctor to give you information about these other medicines.

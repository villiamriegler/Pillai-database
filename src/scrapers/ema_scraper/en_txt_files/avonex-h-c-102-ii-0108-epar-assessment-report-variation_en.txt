III.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
3.1. 
Introduction 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease characterized by an immune cell mediated inflammation and 
progressive  degeneration  of  neurons  and  their  axonal  pathways.  The  use  of  interferon-beta  therapies  to 
treat  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  has  demonstrated  the  ability  to  impact  measures  of  disease 
activity as well as potentially slow disease progression. 
Avonex  (interferon  beta-1a)  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  diagnosed  with  relapsing  multiple 
sclerosis  (MS)  and  in  the  treatment  of  some  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active 
inflammatory process. The recommended dosage for the treatment of relapsing MS is 30 micrograms (1 
ml  solution), administered  by  intramuscular  (IM)  injection  once  a  week.  No  additional benefit  has  been 
shown by administering a higher dose (60 micrograms) once a week. 
The course of MS in patients under 16 years of age (early-onset MS) appears similar to that in adults. No 
formal clinical trials in paediatric patients have been conducted by Biogen Idec Limited. However, limited 
published  data,  the  majority  of  which  is  in  patients  12  years  and  above  treated  with  the  adult  approved 
dose (30 micrograms IM once per week), is available. An assessment of these data showed that efficacy 
has not been demonstrated clearly in this population although there appears to be an observed reduction in 
relapse  rate.  In  addition,  no  specific  safety  signals  have  been  identified  in  the  published  data  with 
paediatric  patients  in  comparison  to  those  in  adults.  Consequently,  a  type  II  variation  was  approved  to 
reflect this information (EMEA/H/C/102/II/82). 
This  variation  application  is  submitted  further  to  the  request  of  the  CHMP  following  assessment  of  the 
FUM 76 (submission of the article 45 of the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006, as amended). 
It  refers  to  an  update  of  sections  4.2  ,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  to 
reflect paediatric information  according to the SPC guideline. 
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
Clinical Aspects 
Clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted a paper of one completed paediatric study for Avonex (Pakdaman et al 20061), that 
was  a  prospective,  randomized,  single-centre  trial  treating  16  MS  patients  under  the  age  of  16,  with  15 
micrograms IM Avonex once per week, aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of the half adult dose 
in this population. After the review of these data, the CHMP concluded the following: “the results suggest 
that the use of interferon beta 1a at one half the standard dose use in adults, and currently recommended 
for  children  between  12-16  years  (i.e.  30mcg  once  a  week),  is  well  tolerated  and  might  be  effective  in 
reducing  the  rate  of  relapses  (nearly  twice  in  the  non-treated  group)  and  the  degree  of  disease 
progression  as  assessed  by  changes  in  EDSS.    Data  provided  are  too  limited  to  draw  any  dose-
recommendation. However, the information may be included in the SPC Section 5.1 as it might be helpful 
for physicians. Based on data submitted, the MAH should briefly include this information in Section 5.1 of 
the SPC.”  
As highlighted by the CHMP during their assessment, this study had a number of short-comings including 
low patient numbers and a lack of comparison with the approved 30 microgram IM once per week dose.

The  majority  of  data  in  paediatric  patients  were  in  patients  12  years  of  age  and  older  treated  with  the 
approved adult dose (30 micrograms IM once per week).  
As part of this type II variation application submitted to fulfil the CHMP request, the MAH presented data 
of a recent publication (Ghezzi et al 20092), which describes a long-term follow-up of paediatric patients 
initiated  on  treatment  with  immunomodulators  before  the  age  of  16:  77  patients  treated  with  30 
micrograms IM Avonex once per week, 36 with another interferon beta-1a, 3 with interferon beta-1b  and 
14 with glatiramer (total 130 patients). This paper was also submitted as part of the 22nd PSUR Bridging 
Report, currently under assessment by the CHMP. 
In general, treatment with all interferons was initiated at a quarter or half dose before increasing to the full 
dose within 1 to 2 months. 
Of the Avonex-treated patients, 34 (44%) continued treatment for the full period of the study (4.7 +or- 2 
years, median 4.5), 20 subjects (26%) were lost to follow-up or stopped treatment after a mean follow-up 
of 3.9 ± 2.4 years (median 3.7), and 23 subjects (30%) transferred to other products after a mean interval 
of 2.5 ± 1.4 years (median 2.3). 
Relapse  rate  decreased  in  all  Avonex  treated  subgroups  and  the  final  Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale 
(EDSS)  score  did  not  change  significantly  compared  to  the  initial.  The  main  efficacy  outcomes  of  the 
study are summarized in Table 1.

Clinical safety/ Pharmacovigilance Aspects 
As of 30 April 2009, an estimated 375,000 patients have been exposed to Avonex worldwide (22nd PSUR 
July 2009), with over 1,200,000 person-years of exposure. Avonex exposure in the paediatric population is 
not known but certainly comprises only a very small percentage of the total exposure. As the incidence of 
MS  presenting  before  the  age  of  12  years  old  is  very  low  the  majority  of  any  paediatric  exposure  is 
predominantly in the adolescent population.

A small number of ADRs reported in paediatric/adolescent patients have been reported in postmarketing 
experience  with  Avonex.  The  data  received  to  date  suggests  the  safety  profile  of  Avonex  as  judged  by 
spontaneous suspected ADRs in this patient population is consistent with that of adults. 
To  date,  there  have  been  no  findings  suggestive  of  a  signal  specific  to  paediatric  patients  treated  with 
Avonex. 
Pakdaman  reports  the  safety  outcomes  of  treating  8  paediatric  patients  with  15  micrograms  IM  Avonex 
once  per  week,  observing  no  drop-outs  during  the  study  with  no  patients  discontinuing  the  drug  or 
developing serious side-effects. 
Ghezzi (et al 2009) reported clinical side-effects in 30 / 77 (39%) of Avonex treated subjects. As with the 
Pakdaman  study  the  authors  from  the  Ghezzi  study  concluded  that  the  safety  profile  of  Avonex  treated 
paediatric patients was consistent to that observed in adult patients. 
Discussion 
After  the  review  of  the  Pakdaman  et  al  study  results,  the  CHMP  accepted  the  inclusion  of  a  statement 
summing up the results in Section 5.1 of the SPC under the consideration of its relevance for prescribers. 
An additional change not requested by the CHMP was also presented: the MAH proposed  to include the 
results  of  the  above  mentioned  study  in  section  5.1  but  also  in  section  4.2,  which  was  not  considered 
justified.  Furthermore,  the  results  of  an  additional  recently  published  observational  study  in  which  77 
patients were exposed to Avonex for up to 4 years at the dose regimen currently recommended in adults 
were also presented. These results are consistent to the already known efficacy/safety profile of Avonex in 
adults  and  thus,  reassuring.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  considered  the  data  insufficient  to  justify  the 
inclusion of any new statement in the SPC since it would not add relevant information  to that currently 
included.  
The CHMP therefore recommended changes in sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 to reflect the Pakdaman results in 
section 5.1 and to reflect already approved paediatric information, in accordance with the SPC guideline. 
3.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following SPC changes (strikethrough= deleted text, underlined= new text): 
•  Section 4.2 
Paediatric population 
Children and adolescents: No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in 
children or adolescents. However, limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents 
from 12 to 16 years of age receiving AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week is similar to that 
seen in adults. Use of doses of AVONEX 15 micrograms IM once per week have also been reported in 
the literature. There is nolimited information on the use of AVONEX in children under 12 years of 
age and therefore AVONEX should not be used in this population (see section 5.1). 
•  Section 5.1 
Paediatric population 
There are limited safety and efficacy data available on the use of AVONEX in paediatric patients. A 
cohort of 77 patients treated before 16 years of age, received AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week. 
After treatment duration of 53.6±27 months, relapse rates (RR) decreased significantly (pre-treatment RR 
2.5± 1.9 vs. final RR 0.4 ± 0.6) and EDSS score remained unchanged with respect to the initial score (pre-
-treatment 1.3 ± 1.0 vs. final 1.5 ± 1.2). The frequency of adverse events was similar to that observed in 
adult patients. A study of 16 patients, aged 11 to 14 years, compared AVONEX 15 micrograms IM once 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
per week (n=8) to no treatment (n=8) with follow-up for 4 years. EDSS progression was 2.4 for the treated 
group compared with 3.3 in the untreated group; the relapse rate was lower and there were fewer new T2 
lesions  in  the  treated  group.  None  of  the  patients  discontinued  AVONEX  treatment  and  there  were  no 
significant side effects reported 
Further to the assessment of the proposal of the MAH to amend the Product Information and in the light of 
the  assessment  of  the  submitted  data  (see  section  3.2)  and  responses  to  the  Request  for  Supplementary 
Information,  the  following  SPC  wording  was  recommended  by  the  CHMP  (strikethrough=  deleted  text, 
underlined= new text): 
•  Section 4.2 
Children and adolescents: No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in 
children or adolescents. However, limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents 
from 12 to 16 years of age receiving AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week is similar to that seen in 
adults. There is no information on the use of AVONEX in children under 12 years of age and therefore 
AVONEX should not be used in this population. 
Paediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Avonex in adolescents aged 12 to 16 years have not yet 
been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
The safety and efficacy of Avonex in children below 12 years of age have not yet been established. No 
data are available. 
•  Section 4.8 
Paediatric population: Limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 16 
years of age receiving AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week is similar to that seen in adults. 
•  Section 5.1 
Paediatric population: Limited data of the efficacy/safety of AVONEX 15micrograms IM once per week 
(n=8) as compared to no treatment (n=8) with follow up for 4 years showed results in line to those seen in 
adults,although the EDSS scores increased in the treated group over the 4 year follow-up thus indicating 
disease progression. No direct comparison with the dose currently recommended in adults is available.  
The  MAH  agreed  with  the  above-mentioned  recommendation  and  provided  the  Product  Information 
amended accordingly. 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
On  20  January  2010,  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for vismodegib, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
Following recent enquiries from pharmacists and prescribers received in the past months regarding 
prescribing and dispensing restrictions for women of childbearing potential (WCBP), it came to the 
PRAC’s attention that the current warning in the Erivedge SmPC is not clear. The current warning in 
the SmPC outlines that the initial prescription and dispensing of Erivedge should occur within 7 days of 
a negative pregnancy test. However, the PRAC considered unclear if the day of negative pregnancy 
test is counted as day 0 or as day 1. Considering that it is currently a matter of interpretation if the 
period is actually 8 days (with the day of the negative pregnancy test counted as day 0) or 7 days 
(with the day of the negative pregnancy test counted as day 1), the PRAC recommended to clarify the 
current warning in the SmPC by specifying that the day of the negative pregnancy test should be 
counted as day 1.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information and conditions of the marketing authorisation of medicinal products containing 
vismodegib were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vismodegib, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing vismodegib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

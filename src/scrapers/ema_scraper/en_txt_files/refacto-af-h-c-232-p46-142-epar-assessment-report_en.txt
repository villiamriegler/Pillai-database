Introduction 
On 18 August 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study B1831082 for Refacto AF, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study B1831082; An Open-Label, Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Study of Xyntha  
Moroctocog alfa [AF-CC:  lbumin-Free Cell Culture], Recombinant Factor VIII) in Male Chinese Subjects 
with Hemophilia A is a stand-alone study. 
This single-dose PK study in male Chinese subjects with haemophilia A has been conducted as a post-
marketing commitment to the China Food and Drug Administration for FVIII activity data post Xyntha 
administration in Chinese subjects.  
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The formulation already approved for the US and Asian market was used in this study.  
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
• 
B1831082; An Open-Label, Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Study of Xyntha  Moroctocog alfa [AF-
CC: albumin-Free Cell Culture], Recombinant Factor VIII) in Male Chinese Subjects with 
Hemophilia A. 
Refacto (Moroctocog alfa) received its first regulatory approval on 13 April 1999 in the EU for the 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII [FVIII] 
deficiency).  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including 
newborns.  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence, is not 
indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand’s disease.  
Refacto AF (Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC)) was developed as a successor to Refacto (moroctocog alfa) in an 
effort to eliminate animal/human proteins from the manufacturing process of moroctocog alfa by 
making the product albumin free.  Refacto (Moroctocog alfa) is approved globally, but is no longer 
manufactured.   
Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) marketed in the United States (US) and in selected regions of the world is 
identified by the brand name Xyntha.  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) marketed in the European Union and in 
selected regions of the world is identified by the brand name of ReFacto AF.   
The difference between Xyntha and ReFacto AF is the analytical method used to calibrate the working 
potency standard that is used in the potency assay.  The standard for Xyntha has been calibrated using

a one-stage assay and a chromogenic substrate assay is used for ReFacto AF.  The two products are 
not interchangeable.  
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
B1831082; An Open-Label, Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Study of Xyntha  
Moroctocog alfa [AF-CC:  lbumin-Free Cell Culture], Recombinant Factor 
VIII) in Male Chinese Subjects with Hemophilia A  
Description 
This  was  a  multicenter,  open-label,  single-dose  study  of  Xyntha  in  13  male  Chinese  subjects  with 
hemophilia  A  who  were  ≥6  years  old  with  severe  haemophilia  A  (FVIII  activity  <1%)  and  previously 
treated with >150 exposure days to any FVIII containing products.  The objective of this study was to 
characterize the single-dose PK profile of FVIII activity after administration of Xyntha in male Chinese 
subjects  with  hemophilia  A.    The  sample  size  was  based  on  the  CFDA  requirement  for  a  PK  study  in 
Chinese subjects and to support the continued registration of Xyntha in China.  This study is the first 
PK study of FVIII activity after moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) administration in Chinese subjects. 
Subjects  underwent  screening  evaluation  within  28 days  of  Day 1  dosing.    Day 0  was  defined  as  the 
day prior to first day of dosing (Day 1).  Each subject participated for up to 33 days; 28 days between 
the start of Screening and Day -1, Day 0, and then 4 days after dosing on Day 1. 
The dosage form administered was the commercial product approved in China, which was a vial in 1x 
pack containing 500 international units (IU) powder for injection.   
Subjects  did  not  receive  any  FVIII  products,  including  Xyntha,  for  at  least  3 days  (at  least  72 hours) 
before  the  administration  of  Xyntha  on  Day 1.    The  treatment  was  a  single  50 IU/kg  dose  of  Xyntha 
administered  by  intravenous  infusion  over  10  minutes  (note:  the  start  and  stop  time  of  the  infusion 
were to be recorded in the case report form [CRF]) on Day 1. 
The first subject’s first study visit was on 27 July 2015 and the last subject’s last visit occurred on 28 
August 2015. 
The PK and safety results in these subjects are reviewed below. There were no efficacy data collected 
in this study. 
Demographics 
Demographic characteristics by age group are summarized in  
Table 1.  Of the 13 subjects enrolled, 3 subjects were in the study-defined age range of ≥6 and <12 
years  (thereafter  referred  to  as  “younger  subjects”)  and  10  subjects  were  age  ≥12  years  (thereafter 
referred to as “older subjects”).  However, it is important to note that 5 of the older subjects were in 
age categories ranging ≥12 years to 17 years old, yielding a total of 8 subjects under 18 years of age.  
All  subjects  were  Chinese  males.    Subjects  ranged  in  age  from  6  to  60  years,  and  had  a  mean 
(standard  deviation  [SD])  body  mass  index  (BMI)  of  20.5 (4.6) kg/m2  with  a  range  of  15.0  to  26.5 
kg/m2.    Mean  weight  was  54.1  (19.2)  kg  with  a  range  of  23.5  to  84.0  kg.    Mean  height  was  159.7 
(19.6) cm with a range of 125 to 178 cm.

Body mass index was defined as weight (kg)/(height [cm] × 0.01)2.  
Biopharmaceutics 
Human  citrated  plasma  samples  (collected  on  Screening  [Day  -28  to  Day  -1],  Day  0  through  Day  4) 
were analyzed for FVIII activity and FVIII inhibitor (Screening, Day 0, and Day 4 only) using validated, 
sensitive,  and  specific  analytical  one-stage  coagulation  assays.  There  were  no  issues  related  to 
bioavailability identified that would impact efficacy and/or safety of Xyntha. 
Clinical Pharmacology 
FVIII  PK  parameters  following  50  IU/kg  doses  were  assessed  in  the  13  Chinese  male  subjects  with 
haemophilia  A,  3  of  whom  were  younger  subjects  (≥6  and  <12  years  of  age),  and  10  older  subjects 
(≥12 years of age).  The PK results of both younger subjects and older subjects are presented. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Methodology 
On  Day  1,  subjects  received  the  dose  of  Xyntha  by  intravenous  infusion  over  10  minutes.    Blood 
samples  were  collected  pre-dose  (within  2  hours  before  administration)  and  at  0.25,  0.5,  1,  3,  6,  9, 
24, 28, 32, 48 and 72 hours after the start of the infusion.  Each sample volume was 2.7 mL and the 
total volume of blood collection for PK was about 32.4 mL.   
The  PK  parameters,  listed  in  Table 2,  for  FVIII  activity,  were  calculated  for  each  subject  using 
non-compartmental  analysis  of  plasma  concentration-time  data.    Samples  below  the  lower  limit  of 
quantification were set to 0 for analysis.  Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis.  
The PK parameters were summarized descriptively by age group (≥6 to <12 years and ≥12 years).

If data permitted (only where a well-characterized terminal phase was observed).  A well-characterized terminal phase 
was defined as one with at least 3 data points,  r2≥0.9, and the percent of area under the plasma FVIII activity-time profile from 
time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC inf), obtained by forward extrapolation (AUC extrap%) ≤20% (See Section 9.5.4.3 of 
Clinical Study Report). 
Safety Evaluations:  
Safety evaluations were assessed by AE and SAE monitoring, clinical safety laboratory assessments, 
vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, temperature), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
monitoring, physical examination and monitoring of bleeding episodes and medically important events 
(inhibitor development and thrombogenicity). 
Statistical Methods: 
Pharmacokinetics: The PK concentration analysis population was defined as all subjects enrolled and 
treated who had at least 1 reported FVIII activity measure.

The PK parameter analysis population was defined as all subjects enrolled and treated who had at least 
1 of the PK parameters of primary interest reported. 
The PK parameters: maximum observed FVIII activity (Cmax), time for Cmax (Tmax), area under the 
plasma  FVIII  activity-time  profile  from  time  0  to  the  time  of  the  last  quantifiable  concentration 
(AUClast),  area  under  the  plasma  FVIII  activity-time  profile  from  time  0  extrapolated  to  infinite  time 
(AUCinf),  steady-state  volume  of  distribution  (Vss),  terminal  phase  rate  constant  (kel),  terminal 
elimination half-life (t½), mean residence time (MRT), system clearance (CL), and incremental recovery 
were  summarized  descriptively  by  age  group.  FVIII  activity  results  were  listed  and  summarized 
descriptively by PK sampling time. 
Samples collected more than 20% earlier or later in time than the nominal time were not included in 
the  summary.  Individual  subject,  mean  (±  standard  deviation  [SD])  and  median  profiles  of  the  FVIII 
activity-time data by age group were plotted in both linear and semi-log scales. For summary statistics 
and summary (mean and median) plots by sampling time, the nominal PK sampling time was used. For 
individual subject plots by time, the actual sampling time was used. 
The  PK  parameters  were  summarized  descriptively  for  all  subjects  and  by  age  group  (6  -  <12  years 
and ≥12 years). 
Safety:  All  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  were  included  in  the  safety 
analyses  and  listings.  Safety  evaluations  were  summarized  descriptively  in  accordance  with  Pfizer’s 
safety reporting standards.

The PK parameter results are summarized descriptively in Table 3.  Geometric mean AUCinf was about 
57%  lower  in  the  younger  subjects  (≥6  and  <12  years)  relative  to  the  older  subjects  (≥12  years), 
while geometric mean Cmax was 28% lower.  Consistent with the lower exposures, CL was higher and 
t½ was shorter in younger subjects than those in older subjects.  Vss was higher in younger subjects 
compared to that in older subjects.  Incremental recovery was lower in younger subjects compared to 
that in older subjects, with geometric mean values of 1.695 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) and 2.498 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) 
in younger subjects and older subjects, respectively.

Efficacy 
There were no efficacy evaluations performed in this study. 
Safety 
Safety was assessed on all subjects who received at least 1 dose of Xyntha 50 IU/kg during the study 
through last subject visit and included adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluations, physical examinations, and vital signs.  Any clinical laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG), 
blood pressure, and pulse rate abnormalities of potential clinical concern were to be described. 
Safety Methodology 
The investigator obtained and recorded on the CRF all observed or volunteered AEs, the severity (mild, 
moderate,  or  severe)  of  the  events,  and  the  investigator’s  opinion  of  the  relationship  to  the  study 
treatment.  Adverse events included adverse drug reactions, illnesses with onset during the study, and 
exacerbation  of  previous  illnesses.    Additionally,  the  investigator  recorded  as  AEs  any  clinically 
significant  changes  in  physical  examination  findings  and  abnormal  objective  test  findings  (eg,  ECG, 
laboratory).

For  all  AEs,  the  investigator  pursued  and  obtained  information  adequate  both  to  determine  the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it met the criteria for classification as an SAE. 
Safety Results 
A  summary  of  all-causality  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE)  and  treatment-related  AEs  is 
provided  in  Table 4.    All  13  treated  subjects  were  evaluated  for  AEs.    Overall,  4  of  the  13  subjects 
experienced 4  TEAEs  after  a  single  dose of  Xyntha  50  IU/kg administration  (2  subjects  [≥18  years  of 
age]  and  2  subjects  [<18  years  of  age]).    All  TEAEs  were  treatment-related.    There  were  no  deaths, 
severe AEs, or permanent discontinuations due to TEAEs reported in this study.  Two subjects (6 and 
15 years old) reported SAEs (FVIII inhibition).

Two subjects (6 and 15 years old) presented with FVIII inhibition and, as FVIII inhibition is medically 
important, these were reported as SAEs.  For these two subjects, Day 4/last visit FVIII inhibitor was 
reported as positive by the central laboratory (0.7044 and 0.9840 Bethesda Unit (BU)/mL, respectively 
[negative <0.6 BU/mL]).  As part of the routine follow-up, further FVIII inhibitor testing was carried 
out and results were negative for both subjects.  These events were assessed by the investigator as 
being mild in severity.  Both subjects did not experience any clinical manifestation of FVIII inhibitors 
and did not receive specific treatment for these events of transient, low-titre FVIII inhibitor. 
Benefits and Risks Conclusions 
Subjects  aged  6  to  <12  years  have  a  lower  exposure  (AUCinf,  AUClast  and  Cmax),  larger  volumes  of 
distribution,  lower  recovery,  higher  CL,  and  shorter  t ½  compared  with  older  subjects.    Low  titer, 
transient,  positive  FVIII  inhibitor  results  occurred  once  in  2  subjects;  these  were  considered  as  SAEs 
but neither was associated with clinical signs or symptoms.  
Administration of a single dose of Xyntha 50 IU/kg by intravenous infusion is considered safe and well 
tolerated in this study. 
Based on the PK and safety results for younger and older subjects in this study, the overall benefit-risk 
profile  of  Xyntha  50  IU/kg  remains  favourable  for  younger  and  older  subjects.  The  PK  parameters 
observed in this study of Chinese subjects are similar to those observed in other studies. 
Conclusions: 
The overall conclusion of the MAH is endorsed.  
The MAH has submitted the final report for study B1831082; An Open-Label, Single Dose 
Pharmacokinetic Study of Xyntha  Moroctocog alfa [AF-CC: albumin-Free Cell Culture], Recombinant 
Factor VIII) in Male Chinese Subjects with Hemophilia A. This is a study using the Xyntha product, a 
moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) product marketed in the United States (US) and in selected regions of the 
world.  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) marketed in the European Union and in selected regions of the world 
is identified by the brand name of ReFacto AF.   
The difference between Xyntha and ReFacto AF is the analytical method used to calibrate the working 
potency standard that is used in the potency assay.  The standard for Xyntha has been calibrated using 
a one-stage assay and a chromogenic substrate assay is used for ReFacto AF.  The two products are 
not interchangeable.  
The PK parameters observed in this study of Chinese subjects are similar to those observed in other 
studies. The study of Chinese subjects, showed a geometric mean of AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax  7.931 
IU•hr/mL, 7.702 IU•hr/mL and 0.8952 IU/mL, respectively in the subjects ≥6 and <12 years. 
Geometric mean of Vss was 67.18 mL/kg, incremental recovery was 1.695 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg), and CL 
was 6.653 mL/hr/kg. Mean t½ was 7.173 hours. In subjects aged ≥12 years, geometric mean of 
AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax were 18.48 IU•hr/mL, 17.51 IU•hr/mL and 1.235 IU/mL, respectively. 
Geometric mean of Vss was 50.53 mL/kg, incremental recovery was 2.498 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg), and CL 
was 2.669 mL/hr/kg. Mean t½ was 13.76 hours. Children aged 6 to <12 years have lower exposure 
(AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax), larger volumes of distribution, lower recovery, higher CL, and shorter t½ 
compared with older children and adults. 
The administration of a single dose of Xyntha 50 IU/kg by intravenous infusion was considered to be 
safe and well tolerated in this study. Low titer, transient, positive FVIII inhibitor results occurred once

symptoms. 
The submission of this study do not have any impact on the overall benefit risk of Refacto AF, nor any 
impact on the already approved SmPC for Refacto AF.

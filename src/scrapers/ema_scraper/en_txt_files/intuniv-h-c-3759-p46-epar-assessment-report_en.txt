1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC)  
No1901/2006, as amended. 
A critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for an ongoing 2-year multi-center open-label extension study of  
guanfacine 1-7mg in children and adolescents who were diagnosed with ADHD and had participated in  
two preceding placebo-controlled studies, one short term study among 6-17 year olds and one  
randomised-withdrawal study. Objectives were to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of  
guanfacine, to provide access to guanfacine following participation in the preceding studies, and to  
assess maintenance of efficacy.  
2.3.  Clinical study  
Methods 
Study population /Sample size 
The study was conducted at 52 sites in 11 countries in Europe: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, 
Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Ukraine, and United Kingdom. Approximately 249  
patients were expected to be eligible to be enrolled in this study. In total, 218 patients were screened  
for participation. 
Treatments 
Patients were treated using guanfacine extended release 1-7mg for a  7-week dose optimization period,  
a 95-week dose maintenance period, and a 2-week dose taper period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy was assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and the Clinical Global 
Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale. 
Safety was assessed including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs,  
electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory assessments, physical examination assessments 
 
 
(including height, weight, and BMI assessments), and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- 
SSRS). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 215 patients were enrolled, of whom 133 subjects (62.1%) completed the study. The mean  
(SD) length of exposure to guanfacine was 564.5 (238.08) days with a median duration of exposure of 
708 days. Disposition of patients see table 1 below: 
Table 1 Disposition of patients 
Baseline data 
At baseline, the overall mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score was 36.6 (0.73); mean (SEM) subscale  
scores were 17.2 (0.45) for hyperactivity/impulsivity and 19.4 (0.36) for inattentiveness. At baseline, 2  
patients (1%), both aged 13-18 years, were considered to show normal/borderline illness severity on  
the CGI. The remaining 206 patients were considered mildly affected or greater. 
 
Efficacy results 
At the final 95-week assessment, the overall mean (SEM) change in ADHD-RS-IV total score from  
baseline was -19.8 (0.84); mean (SEM) changes in subscale score were -10.1 (0.44) for  
hyperactivity/impulsivity and -9.8 (0.47) for inattentiveness. 
At the final assessment, 96 patients (46.4%) were categorized as CGI normal/borderline severity  
including 45 (35.4%) of all patients aged 6-12 years and 51 (63.8%) of all patients aged 13-18 years. 
CHMP comment: 
A considerably larger proportion of adolescents shifted in CGI-category when compared with the data  
submitted as part of the original MAA. The MAH is requested to discuss this difference.  
Safety results 
Overall, 82.7% of all patients experienced TEAE’s (6-12year olds: 84.7%; 13-17 year olds: 79.5%). 
The most frequently reported were somnolence, headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, 
insomnia, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and rhinitis, oropharyngeal pain and upper respiratory  
tract infection, see table 2. 
Table 2: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 5% 
 
 
 
 
 
No deaths occurred during the study. 
Ten patients had serious TEAEs. These included (classified as): appendicitis (severe), gastroenteritis 
(severe), stomatitis (moderate), lower limb fracture (moderate), concussion (1 moderate; 1 mild),  
radius fracture (severe), upper limb fracture (mild), wrist fracture (severe), testicular torsion  
(moderate), postprocedural hemorrhage (moderate) and aggression (moderate).  
Overall, 26.6% of all patients experienced a TEAE that required dose reduction (6-12year olds: 31.3%;  
13-17 year olds: 19.3%). Seven patients discontinued treatment due to TEAE’s (6-12year olds: 3.1%;  
13-17 year olds: 3.6%).  These included weight increase, dizziness, somnolence (2 patients),  
atrioventricular block, drug abuse, and aggression.  
No new safety signals were identified in terms of TEAE incidence, severity, or specificity; clinical  
laboratory assessments; vital signs; ECG; and C-SSRS. No new cases of QT-interval prolongation or  
bradycardia were identified. 
Sedative events were reported in 51 patients (38.9%) aged 6-12 years and in 30 patients (36.1%) 
aged 13-18 years. The mean (SD) duration of sedation  was 33.4 (62.21) days in 6-12 year olds and  
76.2 (138.99) days in 13-18 year olds. The incidence was highest in the first few weeks of treatment  
(see figure 1): 
Figure 1: Incidence of Treatment-emergent Sedative Adverse Events 
At the final study assessment, 25 patients (11.7% of the safety analysis set) had a shift in BMI from  
healthy BMI (≥5th percentile and <85th percentile) at baseline to overweight (≥85th percentile and  
<95th percentile) or obese (≥95th percentile), or a shift from overweight at baseline to obese.  
 
 
 
 
CHMP comment: 
The clinical relevance of BMI percentile-shifts is considered difficult to assess. The MAH is requested to  
submit proportions of patients (children and adolescents separately) with a clinically relevant increase  
in BMI-increase at final assessment as compared to baseline. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Given the open-label study design, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding maintenance of efficacy.  
It is, however, noted, that this was less favourable for youngest age group (6-12 y old) versus older  
children and adolescents.   
The B/R balances remains positive. No essential new adverse events emerged, although it seems that  
overweight/obesity incidence increases at longer follow-up, given the lower incidences that were  
reported before in the SmPC. Overall drop-out due to AEs was low and similar between age groups,  
hence the B/R remains positive.   
4.  Assessment of response 
1.  A considerably larger proportion of adolescents shifted in CGI-category when compared with  
the data submitted as part of the original MAA. The MAH is requested to discuss this difference  
between age groups.  
MAH response 
To clarify, because the CGI-S was used in study SPD503-318 and not the CGI-I that had 
been used in other clinical studies, a direct comparison of results between the different 
questionnaires cannot be made. Both scales are scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 7; 
however, the CGI-S describes the severity of illness and the CGI-I describes improvement 
since a specified time. 
 
 
 
 
A summary of CGI-S scores by age-group at baseline, week 12, and at the final assessment of 
studies SPD503-318 and SPD503-315 are provided in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. 
Because study SPD503-318 is a rollover study of studies SPD503-315 and SPD503-316, an 
understanding of CGI-S scores by age group in the precedent studies is helpful to explain 
distribution of scores by age group in the rollover study. The CGI-S scores at week 12 are 
included in the presentation of SPD503-318 results to allow for comparisons with the CGI-S 
score endpoint at the end of the open-label period of the SPD503-315 study. 
The distribution pattern among the CGI-S scores is similar between the 2 age groups and as 
seen in the antecedent study SPD503-315. At baseline, the subjects in study SPD503-318 
were less ill than subjects in the SPD503-315 study, which is not surprising considering that 
most subjects had had received treatment for ADHD symptoms in the antecedent studies 
SPD503-315 and SPD503-316 (SPD503ANT). At week 12, 40 subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
subjects (33.6%) and 21 subjects aged 13 to 17 years (28.0%) were considered mildly ill; 36 
subjects aged 6 to 12 years (30.3%) and 35 subjects aged 13 to 17 years (46.7%) were 
considered borderline ill. At the final assessment, a greater proportion of the adolescent 
subjects had a CGI-S score of 1 or 2 and were considered either normal or borderline ill. In 
contrast, a greater proportion of the children had a CGI-S score of either 2 or 3. 
A presentation of CGI-S scores by age-group at the start and the end of the SPD503 dose 
optimization period of study SPD503-315 is provided in Table 2. At baseline, all subjects 
were at least moderately ill and nearly half of subjects in both age groups were considered to 
be markedly ill (47.9% of subjects aged 6 to 12 years and 53.5% of subjects aged 13 to 
17 years. At the the final assessment LOCF (visit 13/week 13), the distribution of milder 
category scores was proportional between the 2 age subgroups: the greatest proportion of 
 
 
 
subjects shifted to the borderline ill category (186 subjects aged 6 to 12 years [49.9%] and 52 
subjects [41.6%]; which was followed with a shift to the normal, not at all ill category (71 
subjects aged 6 to 12 years [19.0%] and 34 subjects aged 13 to 17 years [27.2%]. 
As shown in Figure 1, a greater proportion of adolescents had milder CGI-S scores compared 
with children in the roll-over study SPD503-318. 
Several factors differentiate study SPD503-318 from the phase 3 studies that comprised the 
MAA. Firstly, the subjects enrolled in SPD503-318 had been enrolled in the antecedent 
studies (SPD503ANT) SPD503-315 or SPD503-316. In both antecedent studies, a minimum 
baseline CGI-S score of 4 was necessary for inclusion. This criterion could not be adopted in 
the SPD503-318 study because most of the subjects who participated in this safety extension 
study had had prior exposure to either SPD503 (from SPD503-316 or from the open-label 
 
 
 
period of SPD503-315) or atomoxetine (from SPD503-316). Also, the adolescent subjects in 
the SPD503-318 study could have been some of the children in the antecedent studies. It is 
well-known, that adolescent responses vary relative to children for many reasons including 
general engagement (Field 2004). Rebellion against adult authority, peer pressure, and 
inadequate time for training and preparation of the adolescent subject are also known 
behavioral confounders in clinical studies with adolescents. Consistent with this, CGI-S 
scores in the short-term SPD503 studies have not shown as robust improvement as has been 
observed in the SPD503-318 longer-term rollover study, presumably because these subjects 
who were enrolled in a prior clinical studies with SPD503 are better prepared and more 
engaged with the experience of and having had made connections with study staff in one of 
precedent studies to this extension study. 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH response is considered acceptable. The difference may be consistent with the selection of  
treatment-responsive subjects in the preceding studies by differential discontinuations /drop-outs. 
In addition, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy from this study, given the open- 
label and uncontrolled study design.  
Issue resolved. 
2.  One additional issue that may need additional analysis is the difference between subjects aged 
6-12 years and subjects aged 13-18 years in regard to discontinuation of treatment due to lack 
of efficacy: 10.7% vs. 6.0%. 
MAH response 
Although SPD503-318 was not designed to be an efficacy study, maintenance of response 
was observed after 2 years of treatment with SPD503 in addition to the efficacy achieved in 
the antecedent studies SPD503-315 and SPD503-316, which each had 13-week treatment 
periods. SPD503 was effective compared to placebo in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in 
studies SPD503-315 and SPD503-316. 
A total of 209 subjects (97.7%) comprised the full analysis set of the SPD503-318 study. Of 
these 209 subjects, 128 subjects (61.2%) were aged 6 to 12 years and 81 subjects (38.8%) 
were aged 13 to 17 years. The study was completed by 61.7% and 66.7% of subjects in the 6 
to 12 year and the 13 to 17 year age subgroups, respectively, in the full analysis set. 
Of the subjects who transitioned from the SPD503-315 study, subject random assignments 
 
 
 
 
were as follows: 
  43 subjects assigned to SPD503 
•  29 subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
•  14 subjects aged 13 to 17 years 
  33 subjects assigned to placebo 
•  21 subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
•  12 subjects aged 13 to 17 years 
Of the subjects who transitioned from the SPD503-316 study, subject random assignments 
were as follows: 
  45 subjects assigned to SPD503 
•  22 subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
•  23 subjects aged 13 to 17 years 
  45 subjects assigned to placebo 
•  23 subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
•  22 subjects aged 13 to 17 years 
  48 subjects assigned to atomoxetine 
•  36 subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
•  12 subjects aged 13 to 17 years 
Shown in Table 3, at study SPD503-318 baseline, the overall mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV 
total score was 36.6 (0.73). Overall, the younger subgroup had worse ADHD-RS-IV total 
scores: mean (SEM) total scores for the 2 age groups were 40.0 (0.78) in subjects aged 6 to 
12 years and 31.2 (1.19) years in subjects aged 13 to 17 years. 
The overall mean (SEM) change from baseline in SPD503-318 in ADHD RS-IV total score 
was -20.2 (0.75) after 6 months, -21.5 (0.81) after 12 months, and -22.7 (0.86) after 18 
months. Small differences in the changes from baseline at 6, 12, or 18 months were observed 
between subjects aged 6 to 12 years and those aged 13 to 17 years: 21.0 (0.98) compared 
with -19.0 (1.17) at 6 months; 22.3 (1.08) compared with -20.2 (1.19) at 12 months; and 23.8 
(1.13) compared with 21.0 (1.30) at 18 months. 
 
 
 
The primary reason for study withdrawal was lack of efficacy in 14 subjects aged 6 to 12 years and  
5 subjects aged 13 to 17 years. Demographics and ADHD-RS-IV scores are provided for these  
subjects in Table 4. All of the subjects in Table 4 reported race of white and have an ADHD 
combined subtype diagnosis; except for Subject 604-0001 who has predominantly inattentive 
subtype. 
 
 
 
 
All patients from the SPD503-315 study had had experience with SPD503 treatment during 
the open-label lead-in period. In contrast, approximately 2/3 of subjects from the SPD503- 
316 study did not. Accordingly, all subjects in the SPD503-315 study had ample opportunity 
drop out of the study due to lack of efficacy before being rolled over into the extension 
SPD503-318 study, while 2/3 of subjects in the SPD503-316 study did not. Furthermore, the 
subjects who discontinued due to lack of efficacy had some of the most severe ADHD-RS-IV 
total scores at the baselines of the antecedent studies and of the SPD503-318 study. No prior 
treatment with any psychoactive medication was reported in 6 of the subjects aged 6 to 12 
years. Oppositional defiant disorder was a co-morbidity in 2 subjects who withdrew due to 
lack of efficacy: 1 subject from each age group. The majority of subjects who withdrew due 
 
 
to reported lack of efficacy had ≥30% reduction in baseline318 ADHD-RS-IV total score at 
several study visits, which would be a greater reduction in ADHD symptoms than that 
observed at the baseline of the antecedent studies (baseline ANT). 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH response is considered acceptable. The study enrolled a selection of –to some extent- 
more guanfacine-responsive subjects in particular in the older age-group from the preceding trials.  
Issue resolved. 
3.  Regarding sedative TEAE’s, the cumulative incidence by treatment week should be analysed 
throughout study duration  
MAH response 
In the SPD503-318 clinical study, subjective-sedative-related effects were examined through 
spontaneously reported sedative AEs (somnolence, sedation, and hypersomnia). The 
cumulative incidence of sedative TEAEs by study week is presented in Figure 2. 
Sedative events were reported in 51 subjects (38.9%) aged 6 to 12 years and 30 subjects 
(36.1%) aged 13 to 17 years. The mean (SD) number of treatment-emergent sedative events 
per subject was 1.6 (1.02) in subjects aged 6 to 12 years and 1.4 (0.89) in subjects aged 13 to 
17 years. The mean (SD) duration of individual events was 33.4 (62.21) days for subjects 
aged 6 to 12 years and 76.2 (138.99) days for subjects aged 13 to 17 years. 
As observed in prior studies, incidence of sedative events is greatest during the early study 
 
 
 
 
 
weeks. Reports decline as the study progresses, as observed in the flatter slope in Figure 2 in 
later study weeks. Sedative events were generally self-limiting, with the majority of 
treatment-emergent sedative adverse events resolving before the start of the dose taper period: 
94.0% of events in subjects aged 6 to 12 years and 80.5% of subjects aged 13 to 17 years. 
The majority of sedative events (118 of 125 events; 94.4%) were mild or moderate. Three 
subjects (5.9%) aged 6 to 12 years and 4 subjects (13.3%) aged 13-18 years had a worst 
TEAE severity of severe. Two events (2.4%; both somnolence) in subjects aged 6 to 12 years 
led to discontinuation (“drug withdrawn”). Twenty-one sedative TEAEs (25.0%; all 
somnolence) in subjects aged 6 to 12 years and 10 sedative TEAEs (24.4%; 9 somnolence 
and 1 hypersomnia) in subjects aged 13 to 17 years resulted in a dose reduction. 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH response is considered acceptable. The sedation profile in the results of the submitted  
study is in accordance with the issue identified in the MAA and represented in the product 
information. This issue has been appropriately addressed in the SmPC, where continuous  
monitoring regarding somnolence throughout treatment is advised.  
Issue solved. 
4.  In the current SmPC, serious weight increase is only reported in 2.9% of the cases. Not  
unexpectedly, the incidence of BMI shifts to overweight/obesity was more common (11.7%) at  
longer-term follow-up. The clinical relevance of BMI percentile-shifts is considered difficult to  
assess. The MAH is requested to submit proportions of patients (children and adolescents  
separately) with a clinically relevant increase in BMI at final assessment as compared to  
baseline.  
MAH response 
The incidence of BMI shifts from healthy to overweight/obese was reported incorrectly as 
being 11.7% of subjects (25 of 214 subjects) in the original SPD503-318 clinical study 
report: the correct incidence of BMI shifts from healthy to overweight/obese is 7.0% (15 of 
214 subjects). 
At the final study assessment, 15 subjects (7.0% of the safety analysis set) had a shift from 
healthy BMI (≥5th percentile and <85th percentile) at baseline to overweight (≥85th percentile 
and <95th percentile) or obese (≥95th percentile), or a shift from overweight at baseline to 
obese. Of these 15 subjects, 14 subjects shifted to an overweight BMI; one subject had an 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obese BMI at the final assessment. All of these subjects had a BMI percentile greater than 
50% at baseline, and all of the subjects who had a shift to obese had a BMI percentile greater 
than 80% at baseline. 
Overall, 5 subjects (2.3%) of the safety analysis set of study SPD503-318 reported 
5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of weight increased (preferred term). All 5 
subjects were between 6 and 12 years of age. 
Details on these subjects with an upward shift in BMI category was reported from baseline318 
to 6, 12, 18, and/or the final assessment at 24 months or early termination (ET) and for whom 
a report of a TEAE related to weight increase are provided in the following paragraphs. Shifts 
include those from healthy BMI (≥5th percentile and <85th percentile) at baseline318 to 
overweight BMI (≥85th percentile and <95th percentile) or obese BMI (≥95th percentile) at 
subsequent time points and from overweight BMI at baseline to obese BMI at subsequent 
time points. The BMI categories are based on the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention Percentile Growth Charts (Please note that due to privacy laws in the EU, only the 
subject’s birth year can be recorded in certain regions of the EU. Consequently, growth 
parameters were imputed using January, June, and December birth months and some subjects 
who may have had BMI shifts from a healthy BMI baseline to an overweight/obese BMI at a 
later time point may not have had such shift when BMI was calculated using a different birth 
month). 
Subject 001-0001 was male aged 8 years at the time of the baseline318 assessment. At 
baseline318, his height was 140.5 cm (99.0th percentile); his weight was 30.5 kg 
(86.6th percentile); and his BMI was 15.5 kg/m2 (43.2nd percentile). During the study on 
day 51, the subject reported a moderate TEAE of insomnia, which resulted in a dose 
reduction from 3 mg to 2 mg of SPD503, and the event resolved after 21 days. Also on 
day 51, the subject reported moderate TEAEs of abdominal pain upper and weight increased, 
the dose was not changed and the event resolved after 119 days. On day 100, the subject 
reported a mild TEAE of poor quality of sleep, the dose was not changed and the event 
resolved after 70 days. All of the TEAEs were considered to be related to SPD503. On 
day 169, the subject had an early termination visit; on day 173, the subject discontinued from 
the study due to lack of efficacy. At the early termination visit, he was receiving 2 mg 
SPD503 and his height was 142.4 cm (98.4th percentile); his weight was 37.2 kg (95.8th 
percentile); and his BMI was 18.3 kg/m2 (86.8th percentile). The subject previously received 
 
 
 
atomoxetine hydrochloride for ADHD from Nov 2010 to 30 May 2012. 
Subject 702-0002 was a male aged 12 years at the time of the baseline318 assessment. 
At baseline318, his height, weight, and BMI were: 
- 165.5 cm (94.5th percentile), 63.4 kg (95.2nd percentile), and 23.1 kg/m2 
(91.7th percentile – overweight BMI), respectively 
At 6 months, he was receiving 5 mg SPD503 and his height, weight, and BMI were: 
- 170.5 cm (95.3rd percentile), 72.6 kg (97.5th percentile), and 25.0 kg/m2 
(94.5th percentile – overweight BMI), respectively 
At 12 months, he was receiving 6 mg SPD503 and his height, weight, and BMI were: 
- 171.5 cm (91.7th percentile), 75.8 kg (97.6th percentile), and 25.8 kg/m2 
(95.2nd percentile – obese BMI), respectively. 
On day 7, while receiving 1 mg SPD503 a moderate TEAE of weight increased was reported 
that remained ongoing at the time of early termination. The event was considered to be 
related to SPD503. Other TEAEs reported included somnolence (1 mild, 1 moderate), which 
were considered to be related to SPD503; were moderate TEAEs of chest discomfort, 
aggression, hypertension, muscle spasms, and poor sleep quality, and mild TEAEs of cough, 
viral gastroenteritis, oropharyngeal pain, and skin striae; all of these events were considered 
to be not related to SPD503. On day 659, the subject was discontinued from the study due to 
lack of efficacy. At the early termination visit, he was receiving 6 mg SPD503 and his BMI 
was 29.4 kg/m2 (97.8th percentile – obese BMI). No prior use of stimulant medication was 
reported. 
Subject 704-0001 was a male aged 8 years at the time of the baseline318 assessment. 
At baseline318, his height, weight, and BMI were: 
- 122.6 cm (9.1st percentile), 28.0 kg (60.1st percentile), and 18.6 kg/m2 
(88.0th percentile – overweight BMI), respectively 
At 6 months, he was receiving 4 mg SPD503 and his height, weight, and BMI were: 
- 124.5 cm (7.7th percentile), 31.1 kg (70.5th percentile), and 20.1 kg/m2 
(92.7th percentile – overweight BMI), respectively 
At 12 months, he was receiving 3 mg SPD503 and his height, weight, and BMI were: 
- 127.0 cm (8.6th percentile), 33.7 kg (74.9th percentile), and 20.9 kg/m2 
(93.8th percentile – overweight BMI), respectively 
On day 118, while receiving 4 mg SPD503, he was reported to have a mild TEAE of 
 
 
decreased appetite that led to a reduction in SPD503 dose. On day 434, while receiving 3 mg 
SPD503, the subject was reported to have a moderate TEAE of weight increased that led to 
withdrawal of SPD503. Both of these events were considered to be related to SPD503. 
During the study, mild TEAEs of headache and terminal insomnia (2 events each) were reported,  
all of which were considered to be not related to SPD503. The subject was 
discontinued from the study on day 506 due to the AE of weight increased and had his early 
termination visit on the same day. At the early termination visit, his BMI was 23.9 kg/m2 
(97.3rd percentile – obese BMI). No prior use of stimulant medication was reported. 
Subject 052-0003 was a female aged 11 years at the time of the baseline318 assessment. The 
subject’s height, weight, and BMI (including the age percentile ratings for each 
measurement) through the study for the 01 January, 01 July, and 31 December age 
imputations are provided in the following table. 
During the study, mild TEAEs of weight fluctuation were reported and were ongoing at the 
time of study discontinuation. At the time of the event of weight fluctuation, the subject was 
receiving 3 mg SPD503. During the study, mild TEAEs of aggression, mood swings, fatigue, 
headache, and insomnia were reported. The TEAEs of aggression, mood swings, fatigue, and 
insomnia were considered to be related to SPD503. The TEAEs of weight fluctuation and 
headache were considered to be not related to SPD503. On day 99, the subject withdrew from 
the study for unspecified reasons. The subject previously received methylphenidate 
hydrochloride for ADHD from 01 Nov 2007 to 19 Feb 2012. 
It should also be noted that at a comparable number of subjects had downward shift in BMI 
between the baseline and final assessment: 17 subjects (7.9%) shifted from a baseline 
 
 
 
 
overweight or healthy BMI to a healthy or underweight BMI at the final assessment: 
12 subjects shifted from a baseline overweight BMI to a healthy or underweight BMI at the 
final assessment and 5 subjects shifted from a baseline healthy BMI to an underweight BMI 
at the final assessment. 
The effects of SPD503 on body weight were assessed based on mean changes in age-adjusted 
z-scores from baseline and shift analyses of height, weight, and BMI. The changes observed 
in these growth parameters of age-adjusted z scores over time were not considered clinically 
meaningful in this subject population considering that patterns of normal human growth are 
highly complex, nonlinear, and difficult to model (Thalange 1996). Also, subjects who 
participated in the SPD503-316 study may have been enrolled to the atomoxetine treatment 
arm. Atoxmoxetine does not affect dopamine to the extent of amphetamines and other 
stimulant-based drugs used to treat individuals with ADHD but it does increase stimulation 
by increasing norepinephrine, which can lead to quicker metabolism, more energy, and 
weight loss. When these subjects enrolled into the SPD503-318 study, the baseline BMI data may  
have been confounded by this effect as well as the ensuing weight rebound upon 
discontinuation of atomoxetine. 
Considering the results from long-term studies with SPD503 in light of recently published 
epidemiological findings for the incidence of overweight and obesity in the general 
population, no apparent signal of risk for weight gain obesity has been observed with 
SPD503 treatment. The observed shifts in BMI percentile are not in excess of observed shifts 
from healthy BMI to overweight and obese, or from overweight to obese BMI, among 
children and adolescents in the general population of Europe and the US over a similar 
duration of follow-up (Hughes 2011; Marcus 2012; Cunningham 2014; Araujo 2014). 
CHMP comment: 
It is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding weight increase and BMI without a control group. 
The data confirm what has been observed before in the trials, i.e. that Intuniv may induce weight 
gain and obesity. The US paediatric population is not considered a relevant reference population 
for this European study population.  
The SmPC already include a warning that weight increase /risk of obesity should be evaluated every 3 
months in the first year of treatment, and every 6 months in the period thereafter. These data 
underscore the importance of this warning 
Issue solved.

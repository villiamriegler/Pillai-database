Introduction 
On 4th April, the MAH submitted the D203 report and annex report (Day 364) for paediatric study FLU 
D-PAN H5N1-032 for Adjupanrix (mock-up pandemic license) and  Prepandrix (pre-pandemic license), 
in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  Monodose  Hepatitis  A 
vaccine Havrix was used as an active control in this study. 
The  applicant  states  that  the  above  mentioned  study  is  part  of  a  clinical  development  program  and 
acknowledges  that  this  study  was  performed  with  another  strain  (A/Indonesia/05/2005  (H5N1)  like 
PR8-IBDC-RG2 influenza strains) than the strain included in Adjupanrix (A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) 
like  strain  used  (NIBRG-14)).  Nevertheless  the  data  were  deemed  useful  from  the  perspective  of 
licenses for both Adjupanrix and Prepandrix.  
A short clinical expert statement has been provided. 
The  applicant  stated that,  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2) of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product and therefore do 
not  require  taking  further  regulatory  action  on  the  marketing  authorisation  for  the  above  mentioned 
product.

Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted interim report for: FLU D-PAN H5N1-032. 
2. 
Clinical study 
The  study  FLU  D-PAN  H5N1-032  was  a  phase  III,  randomized,  open,  active-controlled  study  to 
evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  prime-boost  schedule  of  the  H5N1  candidate  vaccine 
adjuvanted  with  AS03B  administered  to  children  aged  3  to  17  years  old.  The  priming  and  boosting 
H5N1  antigens  were  D-Pan  H5N1  A/Indonesia/5/2005  and  A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005,  respectively, 
adjuvanted  with  AS03B.  The  D-Pan  formulation  administered  in  the  study  corresponded to  the  half  of 
an adult dose, i.e. H5N1 vaccine formulation containing 1.9 µg of HA antigen and AS03B. 
The study was conducted in a single centre in Philippines. 
Methods

Objective(s) 
Co-primary immunogenicity objective: 
- 
To assess the superiority of the HI antibody response against A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1) 10 
days following H5N1 vaccination on Day 182 (1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 [H5N1] HA antigen 
adjuvanted  with  AS03B)  in  subjects  previously  primed  with  two  doses  of  heterologous

A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  vaccine  (Group  H5N1_H5N1)  versus  non  primed  subjects  (Group 
Havrix_H5N1). 
Criterion to be used for the co-primary objective: 
-  If  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the  HI  geometric  mean  titer 
(GMT)  ratio  on  Day  192  (Group  H5N1_H5N1  compared  to  Group  Havrix_H5N1)  is  greater  than  1.0, 
then  the  superiority  of  priming  vaccination  was  shown  and  an  anamnestic  immune  response 
demonstrated. 
Co-primary safety objective: 
-  To  evaluate  the  safety  of  the  pediatric  H5N1  vaccine  when  administered  as  a  two-dose  primary 
vaccination  to  subjects  3  to  17  years  of  age  in  terms  of  occurrence  of  medically  attended  adverse 
events (MAEs) from Day 0 to Day 182 [and to Day 364]. 
Secondary safety objective: 
-  To  evaluate,  after  each  vaccination,  safety  and  reactogenicity  in  terms  of  7-day  solicited  local  and 
general symptoms, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 21 days after each dose and Day 0 to Day 84 
overall,  and  potential  immune-mediated  diseases  (pIMDs)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  during 
the entire study. 
• 
Study design 
This is a phase III, randomized, open, active-controlled, single-center study to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity  of  a  prime-boost  schedule  of  the  H5N1  candidate  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  AS03B 
administered  to  children  3  to  17  years  of  age.  Subjects  were  assigned  to  four  treatment  groups  in  a 
ratio of 3:3:2:2 at the first visit, stratified by age (3-9 years and 10-17 years). 
Blood samples were to be collected: 
- On Days 0, 42, 182, 192 and on Day 364 for Group H5N1_H5N1 and Group Havrix_H5N1; 
- On Days 0, 42, 182 and on Day 364 for Group H5N1_Havrix; 
- On Days 0, 42, and 182 for Group Havrix_Havrix.

Study population / Vaccination schedule 
Healthy male or female children 3 to 17 years of age inclusive at the time of the first study vaccination 
for  whom  the  investigator  believed  that  their  parent(s)/legally  acceptable  representative(s)  would 
comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  protocol.  Female  subjects  of  childbearing  potential  had  to  use 
adequate  contraception  for  30  days  prior  to  vaccination  and  agreed  to  continue  such  precautions  for 
two months after completion of the vaccination series.

The total duration of the study for each vaccine was 12 months.

Statistical Methods 
Primary confirmatory analysis: 
The  primary  analysis  of  immunogenicity  was  performed  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of 
immunogenicity. Since the percentage of subjects excluded from this ATP cohort was greater than 5% 
in any treatment group, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated cohort (TVc) was performed. 
The GMT ratio was obtained using an ANCOVA model on the logarithm-transformed titers. The ANCOVA 
model included the treatment group as fixed effect and the pre-vaccination (Day 182) log-transformed 
titer  as  regressor.  The  GMT  ratio  and  its  95%  CI  were  derived  as  exponential-transformation  of  the 
corresponding group contrast in the model. If the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the HI GMT 
ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1_H5N1 compared to Group Havrix_H5N1) was greater than 1.0, then the 
superiority of priming vaccination was shown and an anamnestic immune response demonstrated. 
Secondary confirmatory analysis:  
No confirmatory analyses were performed on secondary objectives. 
Results 
• 
Study population (total vaccinated cohort) 
Overall, 520 subjects received study treatment including 312 subjects who received 2 doses of D-Pan 
H5N1  1.9  mg  HA+AS03B  (A/Indonesia  strain)  and  208  subjects  who  received  one  dose  of  Havrix  (or 
Havrix Junior) up to Day 42. On Day 182, 260 subjects received the booster dose of D-Pan H5N1 1.9 
mg  HA+  AS03b  (A/Turkey  strain),  while  260  subjects  received  the  booster  dose  of  Havrix  (or  Havrix 
Junior).  More  than  98%  of  subjects  in  every  group  completed  the  study  until  the  day  364  study 
contact.

Immunogenicity results 
The  co-primary  immunogenicity  objective  was  met  and  thus  an  anamnestic  immune  response  was 
demonstrated, as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the HI GMT ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1_H5N1 
compared to Group Havrix_H5N1) was greater than 1 (the value of the lower 95% CI was 7.30).

Safety results 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  MAEs  up  to  Day  182  was  36.9%  in  the  pooled  H5N1  groups  versus 
30.8%  in  the  pooled  control  groups.  Results  suggest  an  increase  in  fever  following  the  second  and 
particularly the third dose of H5N1 vaccine for children <6 years of age. No other safety concerns were 
identified. 
Serious adverse events: 
Up  to  Day  203,  seven  non  fatal  SAEs  were  reported  for  five  subjects.  All  events  were  resolved  and 
none were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events: 
There were no SAEs leading to premature discontinuation. 
Pregnancies 
In  addition  to  one  subject  (group  H5N1_Havrix)  who  reported  pregnancy  up  to  Day  203,  five  other 
subjects  reported  pregnancy  during  this  study  period  until  Day  364.  Two  of  the  subjects  were  in  the 
group H5N1_Havrix, while three subjects were in the H5N1_H5N1 group. All subjects were exposed to 
the vaccine before conception. Three subjects out of the five gave birth to male live infants, whereas 
pregnancy was still ongoing on Day 364 for the remaining two.

Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The D203 report of the study D-Pan H5N1-032 allows the following conclusions to be made: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The  co-primary  immunogenicity  objective  was  met  and  an  anamnestic  immune  response  was 
demonstrated; 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  MAEs  up  to  Day  182  was  36.9%  in  the  pooled  H5N1  groups

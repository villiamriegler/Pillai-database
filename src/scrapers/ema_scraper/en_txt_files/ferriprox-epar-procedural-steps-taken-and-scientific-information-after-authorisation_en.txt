Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC in 
order to update safety information on the use of 
Ferriprox in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment, based on the final results of two clinical 
studies LA39-0412 (An Open-Label Study to 
Compare the Pharmacokinetic Profiles of a Single 
Dose of Ferriprox in Subjects with Impaired Renal 
Function and Healthy Volunteers) and LA40-0412 (An 
Open-Label Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetic 
Profiles of a Single Dose of Ferriprox in Subjects with 
Impaired Hepatic Function and Healthy Volunteers). 
The studies are listed as category 3 study in the 
RMP. The Package leaflet and labelling are updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make some

minor changes requested to be addressed at the next 
regulatory procedure and to update the RMP format

Update of section 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) with new information from 
two clinical studies investigating the potential 
cardioprotective effect of deferiprone-mediated iron 
chelation. Changes to improve readability and clarity 
were introduced in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
deposition (study LA 16-0102) and a previously reviewed 
retrospective study with similar objectives (LA 12-9907), 
section 5.1 of the SmPC was revised significantly. The 
studies described in 5.1 show that Ferriprox is effective in 
removing transfusional iron overload and in protecting 
myocardial tissue from iron deposition and consequent loss 
of cardiac function. Moreover, the warning and posology

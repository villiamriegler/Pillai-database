2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  is  a  collective  term  for  a  heterogeneous  group  of  lymphoproliferative 
malignancies,  ranging  from  indolent  and  incurable  diseases,  such  as  follicular  lymphoma    to  more 
aggressive intermediate- to high-grade NHL, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt 
leukaemia/lymphoma, with differing patterns of behaviour and responses to treatment (Armitage, 1993). 
This is an extension of indication in previously untreated, advanced stage paediatric B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma (B-NHL). 
Epidemiology  
Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL)  comprises  a  heterogeneous  group  of  lymphoid  malignancies.  The  World 
Health Organization’s classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms is accepted as the common 
classification system with the latest update in 2016 (Swerdlow et al. 2016). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the 
Assessment report

fourth most common malignancy in childhood and adolescence. Mature B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) accounts 
for  approximately  60%  of  all  cases  of  childhood  NHL,  of  which  the  majority  are  high-grade.  Within  this 
group of pediatric BNHL, the main histological subtypes are BL, B-AL – analogous to acute mature B-cell 
French-American-British (FAB) L3 leukemia, DLBCL, primary mediastinal large B-cell. 
lymphoma  (PMLBL)  and  aggressive  mature  B-NHL,  not  further  classifiable  (Worch  et  al.  2013).  Burkitt 
lymphoma and B-AL account for 80% of pediatric mature B-NHL. The disease is diagnosed at a median age 
of  9  years  with  a  predominance  in  boys  (>4:1).  Frequent  manifestations  of  the  disease  occur  in  the 
abdomen as well as the head and neck region. 
Approximately 25% of patients present with bone marrow involvement and approximately 5-10% present 
with  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  involvement.  Diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  accounts  for  10-20%  of 
pediatric  B-NHL  and  occurs  more  frequently  in  adolescents,  with  a  median  age  of  11-12  years  and  a 
moderate sex ratio towards males (1.7:1). Children most often present with nodal disease with involvement 
of the peripheral lymph nodes, the abdomen, and the mediastinum. Bone marrow and 
CNS involvement are rarely observed in these patients. Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma accounts 
for  2%  of  B-NHL,  typically  occurs  in  older  teenagers  and  affects  more  females  than  males.  The  disease 
typically  presents  with  a  large  mediastinal  mass  in  the  thymic  region,  including  pericardial  and  pleural 
effusions and metastatic lung disease (Worch et al. 2013, Minard-Colin et al. 2015, Giulino-Roth 2018). 
Risk  group  allocation  for  determining  the  therapy  strategy  incorporates  data  on  disease  stage,  site  and 
surgical resection, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (see Section 1.4). 
Biologic features 
NHL usually originates in the lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. Most NHLs (80-85%) are of 
B-cell origin (Chisti et al, 2017). Many B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) subtypes frequently observed 
in adults are rarely diagnosed in children and adolescents.  
The CD20 surface antigen is expressed on 100% of childhood BL/B-AL and 98% of DLBCL (Perkins et al. 
2003).  CD20  is  expressed  to  the  same  extent  in  adult  and  pediatric  patients  (Plosker  and  Figgit  2003, 
Perkins et al. 2003).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Mature B-NHL represents the fourth most common pediatric cancer diagnosis in Europe and accounts for 
around  60%  of  all  NHL  in  children  and  adolescents.  They  encompass  Burkitt  lymphoma  (BL)/  Burkitt 
leukemia (B-AL), DLBCL, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and other less common histologies (Lones 
et al, 2000). BL accounts for more than 80% of childhood B-NHL. It generally arises in the abdomen and/or 
head  and  neck  region  and  presents  as  advanced-stage  disease  involving  the  bone  marrow  (BM)  and/or 
central nervous system (CNS) in approximately 20% to 25% of patients. DLBCL accounts for 10% to 20% 
of B-NHL in children (Minard-Colin et al, 2015). B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can occur at any age, but 
it is rare in children younger than 3 years of age (Minard-Colin et al, 2015). The median age at diagnosis 
is approximately 10 years (Hochberg et al, 2016). 
The  prognosis  is  good  in  stage  I/II  B-NHL;  however,  there  is  a  treatment  gap  for  an  improvement  in 
outcome  in  pediatric  patients  with  advanced  stage  B-NHL.  Though  effective,  the  treatment  required  for 
pediatric mature B-NHL is associated with major short- and long-term toxicities. Patients with advanced-
stage disease are still at high risk of death (approximately 3%) from treatment complications during the 
first  phase  of  therapy  (Reiter  2007).  More  than  80%  of  the  patients  still  experience  febrile  neutropenia 
requiring IV antibiotics, and more than 50% require transfusions. Acute therapeutic morbidity for patients 
with  high-risk  disease  is  substantial:  95%  of  patients  experience  Grade  ≥  3  infection,  81%  experience 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 7/92 
 
 
  
  
Grade  ≥  3  stomatitis  due to  the  combination  of  high-dose methotrexate  (HDMTX)  and  doxorubicin;  and 
greater than  25%  of  patients  experience  Grade  ≥  3  hemorrhage, transaminase  elevation,  and diarrhea. 
Acute  tumor  lysis  syndrome  is  another  serious  risk  in  the  first  days  of  treatment.  Short-term  toxicity is 
much  less  substantial  for  patients  with  intermediate  risk  disease,  but  approximately  75%  of  patients 
experience at least one Grade ≥ 3 toxicity (Patte et al. 2007). Long-term toxicities include infertility and 
hormonal  failure,  impaired  growth,  cardiac  dysfunction,  and  secondary  malignancies.  With  current 
treatments, EFS rates in children and adolescents with NHL of up to 90% can be reached (Link et al. 2006, 
Reiter 2007).  
Management 
Treatment of childhood B-NHL consists of systemic chemotherapy and includes the use of short intensive 
courses  of  non–cross-resistant  chemotherapy  agents.  The  current  most  used  treatment  regimens  for 
pediatric B-NHL were developed by the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) group and Lymphome Malin B (LMB) 
group, which use drugs with different mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicities. Based on the 
extremely  high  proliferative  activity  of  BL,  a  basic  principle  is  to  maintain  cytotoxically  active  drug 
concentrations  over  a  period  that  is  sufficient  to  affect  as  many  lymphoma  cells  as  possible  during  the 
vulnerable  active  cell  cycle,  using  either  fractionated  administration  or  continuous  infusion.  In  addition, 
efficient CNS-directed therapy by intrathecal drug application addresses the strong tendency for invasion 
of the CNS, especially that of BL. The 2 treatment strategies used in the BFM and LMB group studies became 
the  most  frequently  applied  for  these  patients.  Per  the  combined  analysis  of  results  from  these  studies, 
patients  with  CNS  involvement  (blasts  in  cerebrospinal  fluid  [CSF]),  cranial  nerve  palsies,  intra-cerebral 
mass) had the worst outcome and hence were considered to be very high-risk patients. 
The combined review of the BFM and LMB data showed that among the patients with CNS involvement, 
there was a clear difference between those with presence of blasts in CSF vs. those without. In the BFM 
series, the event-free survival (EFS)  was 70.2% (n = 54) vs. 84.3% (n = 26), respectively. In the FAB 
LMB96 series of patients treated with arm C1, EFS was 75% (n = 24) vs. 94.7% (n = 19), respectively. In 
the LMB 2001 g therapeutic Group C3 (patients until 2006), EFS was 84.6% (n = 13) vs. 97.1% (n = 39), 
respectively. A trend was observed implying improved outcome with the C3 regimen; however, the numbers 
were very small. The proportion of patients with blasts in CSF was very low in this last series (Cairo et al, 
2007).  
Cure rates of children with mature B-cell lymphoma (BCL), mainly Burkitt but also DLBCL, have significantly 
improved over the past 25 years (Patte et al, 2007). The 5-year survival rate of children diagnosed with B-
NHL in Europe, excluding BL, was 84% in the EUROCARE-5 project (Gatta et al, 2014). 
The international, open-label, randomized cooperative FAB LMB 96 study of children and adolescents could 
demonstrate that the reduction of dose intensity of chemotherapy in the intermediate risk group, did not 
jeopardize survival and demonstrated a 4-year EFS over 90% for children and adolescents with intermediate 
risk B-NHL who showed an early disease response and complete remission (CR) after the first consolidation 
course  (Patte  et  al,  2007).  Chemotherapy  reduction  was  not  possible  for patients  with high-risk  disease 
such as combined bone marrow and CNS involvement and poor response to induction chemotherapy (Cairo 
et al, 2007). Based on the results of this trial, the FAB/LMB 96 risk adapted treatment strategy was adopted 
as  the  standard  chemotherapy  regimen  for  children  with  newly  diagnosed  B-NHL  within  the  FAB/LMB96 
cooperative international study group. 
Current Treatment Overview and Outcomes of Pediatric Mature B-NHL 
Over recent decades, results from several prospective clinical trials have shown a significant improvement 
of  outcomes  in  pediatric  patients  with  mature  B-NHL.  Two  highly  effective  chemotherapy  treatment 
strategies have been established: The French LMB protocol and the German, Austrian, Switzerland NHL-

Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) protocol. Effective therapy for children and adolescents with B-NHL includes 
the  use  of  intense  short  courses  of  non-cross  resistant  chemotherapy  agents,  with  the  specific  regimen 
defined  by  the  patient  risk  group  allocation  (limited,  intermediate  and  advanced  stages  of  disease)  and 
including essential CNS prophylaxis. Risk group definitions have been similar, but not identical, between 
cooperative groups. Treatment intensity and outcome depend on established stratification criteria. Patients 
with low risk disease (resected stage I, or completely resected stage II abdominal disease, about 10-20% 
of the B-NHL patients) have excellent outcomes with two courses of multi-agent chemotherapy (3-year EFS 
of  94%  in  BFM-protocol,  4-year  EFS  of  98%  in  the  FAB/LMB96  protocol).  The  intermediate  risk  group 
disease is the largest and most heterogeneous. Event-free survival rates with four courses of chemotherapy 
were about 92% at 4 years within the LMB group and 94% at 3 years within the BFM group. The highest 
risk patients in BFM studies are those with LDH ≥1000 u/l with bone marrow, CNS disease, or multifocal 
bone  involvement. In the FAB/LMB  studies,  the  highest  risk  group included those  with  leukemic  disease 
and those with CNS disease. 
Three-year EFS rate was 81% after six courses of chemotherapy within the BFM group; 4-year EFS rate 
was  79%  after  four  to  six  courses  chemotherapy  within  the  FAB/LMB  studies.  Of  the  high-risk  patients, 
those with measurable disease in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at diagnosis, had the worst outcomes. Both 
BL/B-AL and DLBCL are included in the same therapy regimen and no differences have been identified in 
outcomes based on histology, except for PMLBL (Worch et al. 2013, Minard-Colin et al. 2015, Egan et al. 
2019).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Rituximab  is  a  chimeric  murine/human  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  to  CD20  protein,  a  hydrophobic 
transmembrane  protein  present  on  the  cell  surface  of  pre-B-  and  mature  B-lymphocytes.  In  particular, 
CD20 is present on malignant B cells in most patients with mature B-NHL and leukemia. As CD20 expression 
begins at early pre-B-cell stage and is lost during plasma cell differentiation, it is expressed during all stages 
of B-cell differentiation; however, CD20 is not expressed on stem cells and plasmocytes. CD20 is essential 
for  the  regulation  of  cell  cycles  and  cell  differentiation.  It  has  stable  expression,  with  no  modulation  or 
internalization,  which  makes  it  an  ideal  pharmaceutical  target  (Cartron  et  al,  2004).  Rituximab  binds  to 
CD20 on B-lymphocytes and eliminates these cells via several possible mechanisms (antibody-dependent 
cellular  cytotoxicity,  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity,  apoptosis,  and  synergism  with  a  variety  of 
chemotherapeutic  agents).  The  relative  contribution  of  these  individual  mechanisms  to  overall  killing  of 
target cells in vivo is not known. 
The benefit of the addition of rituximab to the standard CHOP chemotherapy for adults with B-NHL, including 
DLBCL, BL and PMLBL, has been established in clinical trials and is now considered as standard treatment.  
To evaluate the effect of rituximab in the treatment of pediatric patients with B-NHL, Study BO25380 
investigated the impact of adding 6 infusions of rituximab on the improvement of EFS of newly diagnosed 
children and adolescents with advanced-stage B-NHL/B-AL treated with a LMB-based chemotherapy 
regimen in a controlled, prospective clinical trial. 
In this application Mabthera was proposed to be used, in combination with chemotherapy, for the 
treatment of paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months  to <18 years old) with previously untreated advanced 
stage CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia 
(mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL). 
The recommended initial rate for infusion is 0.5 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 mg/h); it can be escalated by 0.5 
mg/kg/h every 30 minutes if there is no hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions, to a maximum of 
400 mg/h. Subsequent doses of MabThera can be infused at an initial rate of 1 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 
mg/h); it can be increased by 1 mg/kg/h every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/h.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study BO25380 evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in pediatric patients ≥6 months 
to <18 years of age with newly diagnosed, advanced stage mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). 
PK of rituximab in combination with LMB chemotherapy has been investigated in a subset of patients as an 
exploratory secondary objective. 
A dose-dense rituximab dosing regimen was applied to account for the high tumor burden expected in this 
patient population.  This dosing regimen included two doses of rituximab within 48 hours in the first two 
chemotherapy cycles (induction cycles), followed by one rituximab dose per chemotherapy cycle for Cycle 
3 and Cycle 4 (consolidation cycles).  In total, six doses of rituximab were administered.  Similar to adults, 
the standard rituximab dose of 375 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) was administered as an IV infusion.  
Rituximab serum concentrations and cluster of differentiation (CD)19/CD20 B-cells were measured. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  data  in  the  pediatric  population  were  compared  with  those  obtained  in  adult 
patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to confirm the suitability of the dose-dense dosing regimen of 
rituximab in pediatric patients. 
The current application is in support of a label update to include rituximab IV for the treatment of pediatric 
patients (≥6 months to <18 years of age) with advanced stage mature B-NHL.

Methods 
A PK study was performed in selected European centres, and planned in at least 34 patients (≥ 15 patients 
each in the 2 age groups: 3 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years; and ≥ 4 patients in the age group 6 months 
to < 3 years). PK sampling was performed during the 4 treatment cycles which included rituximab, with 
the frequency of sampling dependent on patient age. PK samples were analysed in 3 age subsets of patients 
(6 months to < 3 years, 3 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years). For Cycle 1 and 2 pre- and post-dose serum 
concentrations of rituximab were collected, for Cycle 3 pre-dose concentrations of rituximab were collected 
and  for  Cycle  4  a  full  PK  profile  of  rituximab  was  collected  for  patients  ≥  3  years.  The  schedule  of  PK 
sampling by age group is presented in Table 2. 
Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
At Cycle 4, the following PK parameters were calculated for each patient by standard non-compartmental 
analysis  methods  using  Phoenix  WinNonlin  version  8.0  (Pharsight,  Mountain  View,  California,  United 
States), as appropriate and as data permitted: 
•  Minimum drug serum concentration (Cmin), defined as the minimum observed concentration after 
the 6th infusion of rituximab during Cycle 4 sampling schedule. 
•  Maximum drug serum concentration (Cmax), defined as the maximum observed concentration after 
the 6th infusion of rituximab during Cycle 4 sampling schedule. 
•  Area under the drug serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞): AUC measurement up to the last 
quantifiable  concentration,  plus  an  additional  area  extrapolated  to  infinity,  calculated  as:  AUC0-
t+Ct/lambda_z where Ct = the last observed nonzero serum concentration. 
•  Area  under  the  drug  serum  concentration-time  curve,  corrected  (AUC0-∞,corr):  This  parameter 
was adjusted to subtract the area contribution from previous doses to obtain the results for the 6th 
dose only. AUC0-∞,corr was calculated as AUC0-∞ on Cycle 4 – (Ctrough [pre-dose concentration 
on Cycle 4, Day 1]/lambda_z).

•  Clearance (CL), calculated as dose/AUC0-∞,corr. 
•  Volume of distribution (V), estimated from CL/lambda_z. 
• 
Elimination half-life (t1/2), calculated as ln 2/lambda_z. 
The  PK  parameters  of  Cycle  4  were  summarized  by  age  group  and  overall  using  descriptive  statistics 
including arithmetic mean, standard deviation, geometric mean, coefficient of variation, median, and range. 
All pre-dose (trough) and post-dose serum concentrations of rituximab for each age group and overall were 
presented  for  each  cycle  descriptively  including  arithmetic  mean,  standard  deviation,  geometric  mean, 
coefficient of variation, median, and range. 
Comparison of Rituximab Pharmacokinetics Between Pediatric and Adult Patients 
To  compare  the  PK  of  rituximab  between  pediatric  and  adult  patients,  a  population  PK  model  (Study 
BO22334/SABRINA  Report  No.  1071510)  previously  developed  with  software  NONMEM®  in  399  adult 
patients with NHL from SABRINA phase III trial was used to predict the expected PK profiles in pediatric 
patients and overlay the observed PK data from this study. 
Following IV administration in adults, rituximab PK was described by a 2-compartment model comprising a 
time-varying  clearance  component  corresponding  to  the  decrease  in  capacity  of  a  target-mediated 
clearance pathway and a constant clearance component related to the endogenous catabolic processes of 
IgG. The covariates influencing the rituximab PK parameters were tumor size at baseline, B-cells count at 
baseline,  and  BSA.  As  common  for  monoclonal  antibodies,  BSA  has  an  impact  on  clearance  and  volume 
parameters, with the dependence of clearances and volumes on BSA consistent with the allometric scaling. 
The expected PK profiles in the pediatric patients were simulated using the following covariates: 
o BSA values from 233 pediatric patients with juvenile immune arthritis from NP25737, WA19977 and 
WA28117 trials (1077893, 1074871), were used as they were representative of the BSA distribution in 
Study BO25830. 
o Tumor size at baseline was expected to be similar between pediatric and adult patients with the same 
lymphoid malignancy, and therefore, the tumor size at baseline distribution from the SABRINA trial 
(1071510) was used to simulate a tumor size at baseline for each of the 233 BSA values (assuming 
that there is no correlation between BSA and tumor size at baseline).  This was done because tumor 
size was not measured in Study BO25830. 
o Mean and standard deviation of B-cell counts at baseline from Study BO25830 were used to simulate 
the B-cell counts at baseline for each of the 233 BSA values, assuming there is no correlation between 
BSA and B-cell counts at baseline. 
Summary statistics of those covariates are shown in Table 3. 
The  dosing  regimen  of  the  present  study  consisted  of  6  IV  doses  of  375  mg/m2  of  rituximab,  with  an 
infusion rate of 2 hours. For the simulations, the mean actual dosing times per age group were used. 
The 250 simulated pediatric rituximab serum concentration-time courses were summarized using median 
concentration − time profiles and 5th and 95th percentiles (90% prediction interval). The adequacy between

observed rituximab concentrations of the present study and predicted PK profiles was assessed graphically 
by overlaying the observed PK data with the predictions. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The PK set included 35 patients, 22 patients randomized to R-Chemo in the randomized portion, 3 patients 
randomized to R-Chemo from the crossover portion, plus 10 patients from the single-arm portion. Of the 
35 patients in the PK set, 26 patients were in the ≥ 3 to < 12 year age group and 9 patients were in the ≥ 
12 to < 18 year age group; there were no patients ≥ 6 months to < 3 years in the PK set.

Pharmacokinetics of Rituximab by age group 
The pre-dose (trough) and post-dose serum concentrations of rituximab for each of the six infusions over 
time by age group and overall are shown in Table 1.  Boxplots of pre-dose concentrations by cycle and age 
group and post-dose concentrations by cycle and age group are shown in Figure 1 and 2 respectively. 
Rituximab  PK  parameters  at  Cycle  4  in  patients  ≥3  years  by  age  group  and  overall  are  summarized  in 
Table 2. 
On average, the highest serum rituximab concentrations were reached following the fourth infusion (second 
infusion of Cycle 2) with a geometric mean of 367 µg/mL (age group ≥3 to <12 years) and 297 µg/mL (age 
group  ≥12  to  <18  years)  (Table 1).    Three  months  after  the  last  rituximab  dose,  the  median  serum 
concentration of rituximab was 13.0 µg/mL in both age groups (Table 2). 
The systemic exposure (Cycle 4: area under the concentration-time curve [AUC], maximum concentration 
[Cmax]; Cycle 1 to 4: pre- and post-dose concentrations) in pediatric patients with advanced stage mature 
B-NHL was comparable overall between the ≥3 to <12 year age group and the ≥12 to <18 year age group 
(Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1 to 4).  However, the sample size in the older age group was small (N ≤ 9) and, 
therefore, no formal comparison was performed. 
The elimination half-life of rituximab in pediatric patients with advanced stage mature B-NHL was similar 
between  the  two  age  groups  (median:  25.7 days  [≥3  to  <12  years]  vs.  26.3 days  [≥12  to  <18  years]) 
(Table 2) and similar to the median value of 22 days (range: 6.1 to 52 days [Li et al. 2007]) observed in 
adult patients with NHL.

Comparison  of  Rituximab  Pharmacokinetics  Between  Pediatric  and  Adult  Patients  with  Mature  B-cell 
Malignancies 
Simulated rituximab serum concentrations in 233 pediatric patients with advanced stage mature B-NHL are 
summarized in  
Figure 5  for  the  ≥3  to  <12  year  age  group  (N=125)  and  in  Figure 6  for  the  ≥12  to <18 year  age  group 
(N=108) and superimposed with data from the BO25380 trial.  Observed rituximab serum concentration 
time courses from Study BO25380 were within the 90% prediction interval (PI), indicating that the PK data 
in  pediatric  patients  were  in  alignment  with  the  PK  characteristics  of  rituximab  in  adult  patients  with 
hematological malignancies, established previously using population PK methods.

Effect of BSA 
As  is  typical  for  monoclonal  antibodies,  rituximab  PK  parameters  depend  on  body  size  measurements.  
Clearance and volume parameters increased with BSA.  BSA was the most important covariate for clearance 
and volume parameters in the population PK model in adults (1071510). 
Across the BSA range of 0.5 to 2 m2, there was no trend for a BSA effect on the trough concentrations of 
rituximab  and  the  AUC  of  rituximab  in  the  scatter  plots  (Figure 7,  Figure 8),  whereas  the  maximum 
concentrations of rituximab tended to be higher in patients with a lower BSA (Figure 9). 
The adjustment of rituximab dose by BSA was effective for the trough concentrations and the AUC values, 
which are both important drivers for efficacy.  For Cmax, which is mainly dependent on volume of distribution, 
the  BSA  adjustment  of  dose  lead  to  slightly  higher  Cmax  values  for  patients  with  a  lower  BSA,  but  they 
remained  mostly  within  the  range  observed  in  adults  after  3 weekly  dosing  (mean  Cmax  [Cycle  7]: 
255 µg/mL, range: 153 to 381 µg/mL and were well within the range after 1 weekly dosing (mean Cmax

after fourth infusion: 486 µg/mL, range: 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL [MabThera SmPC]).  Thus, dosing rituximab 
by BSA was considered appropriate for pediatric patients with advanced stage mature B-NHL.

Effect of Age 
Since age is correlated with BSA, a similar pattern was observed for the effect of age on systemic exposure 
(Cmax, AUC, Ctrough) of rituximab as was seen for BSA.  Across the age range of ≥3 to <18 years, there was 
no  trend  for  an  age  effect  on  the  trough  concentrations  (Figure 10)  and  the  AUC  (Figure  12)  in  the 
scatterplots, whereas, the maximum concentrations of rituximab tended to be higher in younger patients 
(Figure 12).  However, they mostly remained within the range observed in adult patients after 3 weekly 
dosing (mean Cmax [Cycle 7]: 255 µg/mL, range: 153 to 381 µg/mL and were well within the range after 1 
weekly dosing (mean Cmax after fourth infusion: 486 µg/mL, range: 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL [MabThera SmPC]).

The Applicant presented an updated pop PK model and included a maturation factor to the constant 
clearance  component  to  take  into  account  the  effect  of  the  FcRn  variation  with  age.  The  time 
independent clearance component was mostly dependent on B-cell count and tumour size and these 
are not expected to be linked to maturation. Values for covariates had been taken from the literature. 
The Applicant adequately justified why a PBPK model not would be expected to provide additional 
information compared to the updated population PK model. 
Simulations had been conducted with the updated model to predict exposure in children < 3 years. 
Ctrough and cumulative AUC1-4 cycles are comparable, but Cmax higher in the youngest population.

Pharmacokinetic data from literature search 
A systematic literature search was conducted to identify external rituximab PK/PD data in pediatric patients 
with  mature  B-cell  malignancies  in  the  following  databases:  BIOSIS  Previews,  Derwent  Drug  File, 
Embaseand Medline.  The search terms included PK/PD-related concepts such as absorption, distribution, 
elimination,  and  bioavailability.    These  terms  were  combined  with  the  drug  term  “rituximab”  (including 
synonyms)  and  “B-cell  malignancies”.    The  results  were  restricted  to  studies  in  children  and  no  date  or 
language restriction was applied.  Based on these criteria, publications providing supportive evidence for 
the PK/PD of rituximab in children with B-cell malignancies qualified for inclusion. 
A total of 17 articles were retrieved from the literature search, 7 of which contained PK data in pediatric 
patients with mature B-cell malignancies exposed to rituximab.  All 7 articles described the same data i.e. 
the PK of rituximab which was studied in children and adolescents with de novo intermediate and advanced 
mature B-cell lymphoma/leukemia by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), which was the pilot study of 
Study  BO25380  (ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier:  NCT0057811;  other  identifiers:  CDR0000271941,  COG-
ANHL01P1, U2334S). 
The pilot study was designed for children and young adults up to the age of 29 years. The rituximab dose 
and  dosing  regimen  was  the  same  as  in  Study BO25830.  The  authors  noted  that  children  of  Group B 
(<13 years) tended to exhibit higher post-dose concentrations, similar trough levels and shorter elimination 
half-life than adolescents (≥13 years) of Group B while acknowledging that the patient numbers were too 
small to demonstrate an age-dependent difference. 
The dose-dense rituximab dosing in the two induction cycles followed by 2 consolidation cycles with 1 dose 
of rituximab per treatment cycle, resulted in average post-dose rituximab concentrations of 245-384 µg/mL 
with sustained trough concentrations of 55 and 107 µg/mL.  The elimination half-life was 26-29 days.  The 
authors concluded that rituximab can be safely added to FAB chemotherapy with high early rituximab post-
dose/trough levels and long elimination half-life. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In  Study  BO25380,  CD19/CD20  B-cells  were  not  measured  during  rituximab  treatment.    The  first  post-
rituximab treatment sample was taken 1 to 3 months post-treatment.  Overall, consistent with the mode 
of  action  of  rituximab,  B-cell  counts  were  lower  in  the  rituximab  plus  chemotherapy  (R-Chemo)  group

compared  to  the  chemotherapy  alone  (Chemo)  group  1  to  3  months  post-treatment;  but,  B-cell  counts 
became comparable between the two groups at the subsequent time points 12±3 months and 24±3 months 
post-treatment.

Based  on  the  mode  of  action  of  rituximab  in  which  the  antibody  binds  to  CD20  on  B-lymphocytes  and 
eliminates  these  cells  via  a  number  of  different  mechanisms,  including  antibody-dependent  cellular 
cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  and  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC),  no  significant  differences  in  PK 
properties were anticipated between pediatric patients and adult patients.  This is supported by the fact 
that  CD20  is    expressed  to  the  same  extent  in  adult  and  pediatric  patients  with  the  same  lymphoid 
malignancy (Perkins et al. 2003; Plosker and Figgitt 2003) and B-cell counts and distribution are expected 
to be similar in adult and pediatric patients (Duchamp et al. 2014).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A medical need of rituximab in the condition Treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has been identified 
in children from 6 months to less than 18 years. The proposed dose of Rituximab is 375mg/m² intravenous 
use for the entire paediatric age range. In clinical practice, rituximab is used in the EU paediatric community 
in paediatric B-NHL and the proposed dose of 375 mg/m2 is the dose referred to in the various published 
papers. 
The PK of rituximab was investigated in a subset of subjects in Study BO25380, treated with a dose dense 
rituximab  dosing  regimen  of  six  375  mg/m2  doses  (2+2+1+1).  In  total,  35  paediatric  subjects  were 
included in the PK sub study: 26 in the ≥ 3 to < 12-year age group and 9 in the ≥ 12 to < 18-year age 
group.  Despite  of  a  protocol  amendment  to  included  subjects  below  3  years  of  age  in  the  PK  study,  no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 27/92 
 
 
  
  
 
 
subjects in the youngest age group ≥ 6 months to < 3 years were included. Subjects were evenly distributed 
within the 3-16-year age range.    
Fifteen PK samples were planned during treatment, including trough values before each dose.  Inter-patient 
variability was moderate (16 – 52 %). The highest serum rituximab concentrations were reached following 
the fourth infusion (second infusion of Cycle 2) with a geometric mean of 367 µg/mL (age group ≥3 to <12 
years)  and  297 µg/mL  (age  group  ≥12  to  <18  years).  The  elimination  half-life  was  25,7  days,  similar 
between the two age groups and comparable to the median adult value of 22 days.. Besides a trend towards 
higher  Cmax  in  younger  patients,  rituximab  exposure  were  comparable  both  between  and  within  age 
groups. A previously developed PK model was initially used to compare PK of rituximab in paediatric and 
adult  subjects.  The  model  indicates  comparable  PK  in  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  with  hematological 
malignancies in both age groups  ≥3 to <12 year and ≥12 to <18 year, but differences in body composition, 
extravasation,  and  capillary  permeability  may  have  an  impact  on  distribution,  especially  in  infants  and 
toddlers.  The  Applicant  had  not  addressed  how  the  model  is  relevant  for  the  youngest  children.    The 
Applicant presented an updated adult NHL pop PK model and included a maturation factor to the constant 
clearance component to consider the effect of the FcRn variation with age. The time independent clearance 
component is mostly dependent on B-cell count and tumour size and these are not expected to be linked 
to maturation. Values for covariates had been taken from the literature. It was adequately justified why a 
PBPK model not would be expected to provide additional information compared to the updated population 
PK model. 
Simulations had been conducted with the updated model to predict exposure in children < 3 years. Ctrough 
and  cumulative  AUC1-4  cycles  were  comparable  across  age  groups,  but  Cmax  higher  in  the  youngest 
population. It is agreed that the higher Cmax (over)predicted with the model not is expected to have clinical 
relevance. This is supported by paediatric rituximab data from other indications.  The covariates influencing 
the rituximab PK parameters were tumor size at baseline, B-cells count at baseline, and BSA. BSA values 
from a study with tocilizumab in children with juvenile immune arthritis was used as representative of BSA 
distribution  and  tumor  size  at  baseline  was  simulated  from  the  SABRINA  trial  in  adults  with  follicular 
lymphoma. Patients down to the age of 3 are included in the PK data set. The Applicant presented sensitivity 
analyses to show how differences in tumor size could have a impact on rituximab PK in children. Tumor 
size only has an impact on time dependent clearance, and smaller tumor size equals higher exposure. In 
the  sensitivity  analysis,  predicted  values  of  Ctrough,  AUC1-4  cycles  and  Cmax  are  presented.  Notably, 
Cmax- which would be expected to be the most relevant parameter for safety concerns – is mostly slightly 
affected. Ctrough and AUC1-4 cycles are considerably higher for lower tumor sizes. 
BSA is the most important covariate for rituximab clearance and volume parameters in adults. Across the 
BSA range of 0.5 to 2 m2, there was no trend for a BSA effect on the trough concentrations of rituximab 
and the AUC of rituximab in the scatter plots but Cmax tended to be higher in patients with a lower BSA. 
The  Applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  if  even  lower  BSA  e.g.  in  children  from  6 months  to  3  years  of  age 
would be expected to have even higher exposure and if a BSA based dose also is appropriate in this age 
group. The updated pop PK model includes a maturation factor, and in the simulations, BSA ranging from 
0.35m2 to 2.06 m2 were included. This range is relevant for children < 3 years. The predicted exposure 
values support a BSA based dose. 
Across the age range of ≥3 to <18 years, there was no trend for an age effect on rituximab exposure. The 
proposed indication is intended to be in children from 6 months of age. As previously mentioned, no PK 
data are available in children in the age group 6 month to 3 years of age, but published data and safety 
data from safety databases support that rituximab 375 mg/m2 is safe and efficacious in B-NHL also in the 
smallest children. In clinical practice, rituximab is used in the EU paediatric community in paediatric B-NHL 
and the proposed dose of 375 mg/m2 is the dose referred to in the various published papers. The PK of 
monoclonal  antibodies  in  smaller  children  has  not  been  fully  elucidated,  e.g.  differences  in  ECF  could 
influence Vd and expectedly smaller tumor sizes in the youngest children and differences in B-cell counts

could  have  impact  on  clearance  (Mailk  and  Edginton  2018,  Edlund  et  al  2014),  but  simulations  and 
sensitivity  analysis  with  an  updated pop  PK  model taking  maturation into  account  support  the  proposed 
dose in the youngest age group 6 months to 3 years.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A BSA-based dose-dense rituximab regimen of 375 mg/m2 is acceptable in paediatric subjects from the 
age of 3 years, even though no PK data are available in subjects below the age of 3.  
Rituximab exposure in both age groups ≥ 3 to < 12 year age group and ≥ 12 to < 18 year is comparable 
and simulations using an updated pop PK model including a maturation factor to the constant clearance 
component  to  take  into  account  the  effect  of  the  FcRn  variation  with  age  support  an  extension  of  the 
indication B-NHL indication to the age group 6 months to 3 years can be accepted despite lack of clinical 
PK data in the age group. 
 The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to pharmacology:> 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
 In this study, rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in a dose-dense way whereby in each 
of  the  2  induction  cycles  2  infusions  of  rituximab  were  administered  within  48  hours  followed  by  the 
consolidation  cycles  with  one  rituximab  infusion  per  Clinical  Study  Report  Final  IGR2009/1593  (IGR), 
ANHL1131 (COG) 43 treatment cycle. The basis for this dose-dense rituximab regimen were the results of 
the pilot study ANHL01P1 conducted by the COG where it was demonstrated that the dose-dense rituximab 
therapy can be safely added to chemotherapy and can result in a 95% 3-year EFS (Goldman et al, 2013; 
Barth et al, 2013). 
The PK of rituximab has been well studied in adults with NHL and is best described by a 2-compartment 
model with time-varying clearance (Li et al, 2007). As common for monoclonal antibodies, body surface 
area (BSA) had an impact on clearance and volume parameters. Therefore a BSA-based dosing is expected 
to provide similar exposure in adult and pediatric patients. Based on the mechanism of action of rituximab, 
in which the antibody binds to CD20 on B-lymphocytes and eliminates these cells via a number of different 
mechanisms including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, no 
significant differences in PK were anticipated between pediatric patients and adult patients since CD20 is 
thought  to  be  expressed  to  the  same  extent  in  adult  and  pediatric  patients  with  the  same  lymphoid 
malignancy. Therefore, and in line with the pilot study ANHL01P1, the same dose as for adults, i.e., 375 
mg/m2, was administered in the study.

Therapeutic Group B 
In therapeutic Group B, the pre-phase was followed by 4 courses of chemotherapy: 2 induction courses 
(COPADM) and 2 consolidation courses (CYM). Study treatment administration details for therapeutic Group 
B are schematically presented : 
Consolidation: 2 courses of CYM or R-CYM (November 2015 all patients received R-CYM). Following recovery 
from first (R-)CYM, if CR was not obtained the patient (“slow responder”) was to be switched to C1 regimen, 
– starting at (R-CYVE). If they were randomized to receive rituximab, they were to receive rituximab only 
with the first (R-)CYVE in order to receive a total of 6 courses. 
Therapeutic Group C1 
In Groups C1 and C3, the pre-phase was followed by 4 courses: 2 induction courses (COPADM) with HDMTX, 
and  2  consolidation  courses  (CYVE).  In  those  patients  who  were  responders  at  completion  of  the 
consolidation phase, 2 maintenance courses (M1 and M2) were planned. Study treatment administration 
details for therapeutic Group C1 are schematically presented in Figure 3.

Therapeutic Group C3 
Study treatment administration details for Group are schematically presented in Figure 4. 
Please refer to Section 10 of the protocol (Appendix 12.1.1) for details related study drug administration 
for each group. 
In all those 3 groups and between 2 courses of the induction or the consolidation phases, if the next course 
was postponed due to safety reasons, the patients had to receive waiting COP courses. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  test  whether  adding  6  rituximab  to  the  standard  LMB 
chemotherapy regimen improved the EFS compared with LMB chemotherapy alone in the untreated children 
and adolescent patients with advanced-stage B-cell NHL/B-AL (stage III and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] 
>  upper  limit  of  normal  [ULN]  ×  2,  any  stage  IV,  or  B-AL).  EFS  was  defined  as  the  time  between 
randomization and occurrence of progressive disease, relapse, second malignancy, death from any cause

or  nonresponse  as  evidenced  by  detection  of  viable  cells  in  residue  after  the  second  CYVE  course  (for 
therapeutic  Group  C  patients  and  therapeutic  Group  B  patients  who  switched  to  therapeutic  Group  C), 
whichever event occurred first. 
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
• To study the CR rate and OS. 
•  To  evaluate  safety  in  all  study  arms,  including  toxic  deaths,  adverse  events  (AEs)  recorded  using  the 
National Cancer Institute–Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) Version 4 (non-hematological toxicity 
Grade ≥ 3, infections Grade 3 to 5), cardiac toxicity (CTC Grade 2 to 5 and  evolution of left ventricular 
ejection  fraction  [LVEF]  and  left  ventricular  shortening  fraction  [LVSF]),  number  of  days  with  platelet 
transfusions,  intensive  care  unit  admission,  number  of  days  with  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  transfusions,  and 
rituximab IRRs. 
•  To  study  the  rate  of  patients  with  immunoglobulin  (IgG,  IgA,  and  IgM)  level  abnormally  low  and 
lymphocyte  count  abnormally  low  at  1  year  and  until  5-year  follow-up,  and  to  study  the  need  for 
immunoglobulin infusions and levels of post (previous and re-) vaccination antibodies at 1 year. 
• To study long-term (at least 5 years) risks of the use of rituximab plus chemotherapy compared with LMB 
chemotherapy  alone  in  children  and  adolescents  with  advanced-stage  B-NHL/B-AL  (all  events  related 
[certain and probable] to therapy). 
Exploratory objectives were: 
• To evaluate the potential prognostic value of Minimal Disseminated Disease (MDD) and Minimal Residual 
Disease (MRD) in correlation with outcome*. 
• To perform an economic study comparing the cost-effectiveness ratio between 2 therapeutic strategies: 
LMB chemotherapy with vs LMB chemotherapy without rituximab*. 
• To obtain data on positron-emission tomography (PET) (-computed tomography [CT]) scan in childhood 
pediatric B-cell NHL*. 
• To characterize the PK of rituximab in combination with LMB chemotherapy in a subset of patients. 
*The MabThera PIP did not require these evaluations and therefore they are not presented in this CSR (see 
Section 3.10.9). 
Tumour Assessment 
All abnormal tumor sites at diagnosis were evaluated using the most appropriate modality and taking into 
account the possible context of emergency treatment to do the minimal necessary work-up. This included 
chest x-ray, ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging scans for solid tumors. The response following 
pre-phase COP was reported into the electronic case report form (eCRF) and classified as: 
• CR: Complete disappearance of all measurable or evaluable lesions (except bone), no blasts in the bone 
marrow or in the CSF. 
•  Incomplete  response:  20%  to 99%  reduction  in  the  product  of  the  2  largest  diameters  of  measurable 
lesions (as long as no regrowth occurred by Day 7 after earlier shrinkage). 
• Nonresponse: < 20% tumor reduction of the product of the 2 largest diameters of measurable lesions, or 
tumor progression, or tumor regrowth after initial shrinkage. The response status was to be evaluated after 
1st (R-) CYM (therapeutic Group B) or 2nd (R-) CYVE (therapeutic Group C1 or C3) and was classified as 
follows: 
• CR: Complete disappearance of all measurable or evaluable lesions (except bone), no blasts in the bone 
marrow or in the CSF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 33/92 
 
 
  
  
• Considered as CR: Patients could still be considered to be in CR, even if bone lesions were not completely 
normalized on x-ray, if all other evidence of disease had disappeared. Similarly, a patient could still be in 
CR in the presence of a residual mass, provided large biopsies showed no viable cells. A small residual mass 
(< 2 cm) not accessible to surgery could also be considered to be in CR 
(provided all other disease sites were in CR). 
• Persistent disease: Existence of histologically proven residual disease. 
•  Disease  progression  or  relapse:  Any  progression  of  more  than  25%  in  the  product  of  the  2  largest 
diameters of any measurable lesion, appearance of new lesions, or appearance or reappearance of Burkitt 
cells or tumoral large cells in BM or CSF. 
Evaluation During Treatment 
Response  after  COP  at  Day  7  was  evaluated  by  clinical,  radiological,  and/or  ultrasound  examination  to 
determine  if  there  was  any  tumor  reduction.  Details  related  to  investigations  at  diagnosis  and  during 
treatment is provided in Section 10.7 of the protocol (Appendix 12.1.1).  
In case of B-AL, with only BM involvement, a BM aspirate was required to assess the response. In case of 
no response at Day 7 of the first pre-phase COP, the treatment was switched to a more intensive treatment 
(see sections 10.3.1 and 10.4.1 of the protocol (Appendix 12.1.1). 
• The patient’s general condition (Lansky or Karnofsky index)*. 
•  Full  blood  count,  differential,  and  serum  biochemistry  (urea,  creatinine,  calcium,  phosphorous,  serum 
glutamic  oxaloacetic  transaminase,  and  serum  glutamic  pyruvic  transaminase,  gamma-glutamyl 
transferase, and electrolytes)*. 
• In case of tumor lysis or evidence of renal dysfunction during initial chemotherapy glomerular filtration 
rate  was  determined  by  diethylenetriaminepentaacetic  acid  or  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  excretion 
before proceeding with HDMTX of the first course*. 
• All known tumor sites easily evaluable clinically by standard x-rays and by abdominal ultrasonography 
were evaluated before each course of chemotherapy until complete regression. 
• CSF was examined at time of lumbar puncture for IT therapy. 
•  Echocardiogram:  After  COP  if  not  done  prior  to  start  of  treatment  and  every  2  administrations  of 
doxorubicin in therapeutic Group C.  
Evaluation planned during each chemotherapy course: 
Blood counts were measured at least twice weekly after every cycle, generally 3 times weekly at the time 
of  nadir.  The  patient’s  general  condition  (Lansky  or  Karnofsky  index)  was  documented  regularly  during 
therapy in the patient’s medical records*. 
Evaluation of remission: 
Remission had to be evaluated at a specified time point. For evaluation of CR, all sites with initial tumor 
involvement were fully evaluated. PET (-CT) scan was recommended, and the result was reported in the 
eCRF. 
Patients treated in therapeutic Group B had to be in CR after course n°3 [1st (R-)CYM. In case of a residual 
mass with documented viable cells (histologically proven persistent disease), patients were to be switched 
to  therapeutic  Group  C1  to  be  treated  more  intensively  starting  at  consolidation  CYVE  1  (course  n  3), 
rituximab as allocated by randomization. 
*These  data  are  not  reported  in  the  CSR  because  the  laboratory  data  were  not  collected  in  the  clinical 
database.

Tumor Investigations at Completion of Treatment 
At completion of treatment, all initially positive sites were evaluated to confirm remission. This included 
radiological examinations, BM aspirate, and lumbar puncture examination, as appropriate. 
Follow-up of Immune Status   
Immune functions will be assessed: 
• At diagnosis prior to treatment, 
• 1 month after the end of treatment, i.e., 2 months after the start of the last course of chemotherapy, and 
• Prior to immunoglobulin substitution if decided, - 1 year following study entry in all patients - and yearly, 
if not normalized at 1 year. This immune functions evaluation is only for patients without event or before 
event (event as defined in EFS). The immune functions evaluation includes: 
• The total peripheral blood lymphocyte count and CD19+CD20+ B cells evaluated using flow cytometry, 
• The serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM 
•  Serum  antibodies  to  polioviruses  and  tetanus  and  diphtheria  toxoids  will  be  measured  using  enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays, as well as serum antibodies to pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae, 
andx 
•  Optional  evaluation:  peripheral  blood  counts  of  various  lymphocytes  subsets  [CD3+,  CD3+CD4+, 
CD3+CD8+, as well as CD3−CD16+ (or CD3−CD56+, or CD3−CD56+ CD16+) natural killer cells] using 
flow cytometry. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: EFS 
The primary endpoint of the study is EFS, defined as time between randomization and progressive disease, 
relapse, second malignancy, death from any cause, or non-response, as evidenced by detection of viable 
cells in residue after the second CYVE course (for therapeutic Group C patients and therapeutic Group B 
patients who switched to therapeutic Group C), whichever event occurred first. 
Secondary endpoints: Overall survival (OS, time from randomization to death from any cause) and CR. 
Exploratory endpoints: CR rate in therapeutic group B, response to COP 
Sample size 
The 3-year EFS for these patients was estimated to be about 84% with the standard chemotherapy FABLMB-
96. As this study compared standard treatment with rituximab added to the standard treatment, 1-sided 
test was employed to prove that the addition of rituximab improves outcomes. At a 1-sided 5% level of 
statistical significance and using 1:1 randomization, observing 72 events would provide 90% power for the 
log-rank  test  to  detect  an  increase  in  the  EFS  long-term  from  84%  to  92%,  corresponding  to  a  50% 
reduction in the risk of failure, i.e., an hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5. A total of 72 events were expected out of 
a total of 600 eligible randomized patients (300 per treatment arm). The enrollment rate for these patients 
was expected to be 130 to 150 patients per year, suggesting a total enrollment period (including 6 months 
to get to steady-state) of 4 to 5 years.

Randomisation 
Randomization  of  patients  followed  the  initial  work-up  to  assign  patients  to  relevant  therapeutic  groups 
based on their disease stage. 
The 1:1 randomization is stratified on the following characteristics:  
•  National group: Italy, Belgium, UK, Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, Spain, France, Hong Kong, North 
America 
•  Histology: diffuse large B-Cell, Burkitt or atypical Burkitt or B-AL or aggressive mature B-cell NHL 
not yet specified or not specifiable 
• 
Therapeutic  group:  LMB-B  high  risk  (B),  LMB-C-Cerebrospinal  Fluid  Negative  (C1),  LMB-C-
Cerebrospinal Fluid Positive (C3) 
For the European countries, randomization is done using TenAlea software (NKI, Amsterdam) via internet 
and  the  two  arms  are  assigned  by  minimization  with  an  alea  parameter  of  0.80.    COG  uses  its  existing 
randomization  module  in  its  eRDE  system.  The  treatment  assignment  is  done  by  stratified  blocked 
randomization, using histology and therapeutic group as sole stratification factors. 
For the statistical analysis, some randomization strata were pooled in order to avoid overfitting (approach 
used in the IA): 
•  National  group:  France,  COG,  Other  small  LMB  groups  (Belgium+Spain+UK+Netherlands),  BFM 
groups (Italy+Hungary). 
•  Histology:Diffuse Large B-Cell (CRF stratum 2); Burkit or atypical Burkit or B-AL (CRF stratum 1), 
or aggressive mature Bcell, NHL not yet specified or not specifiable (CRF stratum 3) 
• 
Therapeutic group: B vs C1 vs C3. 
These pooled strata will be created from CRF corrected values. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  an  open-label  study.  Only  the  reviewing  members  of  the  steering  committee  and  IDMC  were 
blinded to the treatment before review of each event.  
Statistical methods 
Interim monitoring for efficacy, toxic death, and futility based on EFS was conducted by the IDMC.  
Three interim analyses were planned, they are all non-binding and the sponsor will make the final decision 
regarding early termination of the study. The interim analyses (IA) for efficacy were planned using the Lan-
DeMets alphaspending function approach applied to an O’Brien-Fleming boundary, truncated at 3 standard 
deviations (SD). The overall type I error was set at 5% (1-sided). 
The trial could be stopped for futility if the alternative hypothesis (HR of 0.50) was rejected. Monitoring for 
futility was done using the Fleming, Harrington and O'Brien approach, considering stopping for futility if the 
alternative hypothesis was ever rejected at a p-value below 0.005.

Table 4 Planned Analysis timings (example, depending on recruitment)  
Due to a delay in center opening and resulting slower recruitment, the first IA occurred 3.5 years after the 
beginning of the study when 27 events had been observed. After this IA, randomization was stopped for 
efficacy, and further interim analyses were cancelled based on the IDMC recommendation. The first interim 
analysis was based on 27 events which corresponded to 37.5% of information and a nominal alpha error 
of  0.00137.  The  current  analysis  is  based  on  38  events,  corresponding  to  52.8%  of  information  and  a 
nominal alpha error of 0.00562. The cumulative alpha error is 0.00699. 
The  primary  analysis  was  planned  for  when  all  randomized  patients  have  been  followed  for  at  least  18 
months and all single arm patients have completed their treatment - expected for 31st December 2017; 
final assessment of safety and pharmacokinetics were expected to also take place at this time. 
The trial patients were split in 3 portions based on the date of randomization: the randomized portion, the 
crossover portion, and the single-arm portion. 
• The randomized portion included all patients randomized prior to 27 August 2015. This date corresponds 
to the randomization date of the first patient who met all of the following conditions: 
o Randomized to the control group; 
o Randomized after the date of the IDMC report from which the decision to stop the randomization 
was made (initial interim analysis report on 14 August 2015, completed on 21 October 2015 and 
03  November  2015  to  answer  IDMC  questions,  IDMC  final  recommendations  on  09  November 
2015); and 
o Received rituximab. 
•  The  crossover  portion  included  all  patients  randomized  from  27  August  2015  to  the  interruption  of 
enrollment (14 November 2015). 
• The single-arm portion included all patients enrolled to R-Chemo after the resuming of enrollment to this 
only R-Chemo arm (March 2016). Patients in whom HBV serology results were positive or not available at 
Day 6, who were randomized and then were withdrawn (c.f. exclusion criteria in Section 6.2 of the protocol; 
Appendix 12.1.1) were enrolled in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  
Intent-to-treat Set; The ITT set included all patients enrolled in the randomized portion. All efficacy analyses 
were produced in the ITT set, unless otherwise specified. 
Modified ITT Set; The modified ITT (mITT) set included all ITT patients, except those ineligible as a result 
of a wrong diagnosis or risk group, or a positive or missing HBV serology at baseline. This population was 
to be used to conduct sensitivity analyses on the primary and secondary endpoints.   
Therapeutic  Group  B  Response  Set;  The  therapeutic  Group  B  response  set  was  used  to  analyze  CR  in 
therapeutic Group B and included patients who met all of the following criteria: Intent-to-treat set patient;  
Initially  treated  in  therapeutic  Group  B  and  Remained  in  therapeutic  Group  B  after  pre-phase  COP 
treatment-response  assessment,  i.e.,  received  COPADMB  course(s)  (COPADM  course[s]  that  patients  in

therapeutic Group B received). Patients who received COPADMB course(s) without meeting the protocol’s 
criterion to remain in therapeutic Group B at that stage (deviation to protocol) were included. 
The main analysis of the primary endpoint EFS will consist in an unadjusted analysis, comparing survival 
curves, and an analysis adjusted on stratification factors, comparing the adjusted HR estimate to 1. The 
unadjusted analysis will consist in a 1-sided non stratified log-rank test. The adjusted treatment effect size 
will be estimated by the HR of groups with Rituximab versus without rituximab by fitting a multivariate Cox 
proportional  hazard  model,  controlling  for  the  national  group,  histology,  and  therapeutic  groups  (pooled 
strata).  The HR estimate, 90% CI of randomization group effect will be displayed, together with the type 3 analysis 
Wald one-sided p-value (adjusted p-value). 
Patients without a reported event at the time of the clinical cut-off (31st of Dec 2017) would be censored. 
Supportive analyses for the primary endpoint: 
•  At months 6, 12, 18, etc. … 60, the count of patients with an event observed within the previous 6 
months,  censored  within  the  previous  6  months,  left  at  risk  at  the  time  point,  product-limit 
estimates of survival rates and 95% CI; 
The number of events, the number at risk and the number of censored observations; 
The 25th and 75th quartiles and median of time to event will be also presented with their 95%CI;

•  Analysis will be repeated in the ITT set on an ITT basis, using the definition of EFS and earliest contribution 
event to EFS, as derived solely from CRF data. 
The 95%CI of KM survival rates will be calculated using the Rothman formulae. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint OS was analysed in the same manner as EFS. Patients without an event at 
the time of the clinical cut-off (31st of Dec 2017) will be censored at the latest date the patient was 
known to be alive, defined as the latest of all collected dates (except date of death). 
Supportive analyses for OS was to be repeated using in the mITT set on an ITT basis and in the expanded 
safety set on an as-treated basis.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 141 centers in 8 European countries, in Hong Kong, and at 159 COG centres 
covering the US, Canada, and Australia. 
First patient in: 19 December 2011  
Clinical data cutoff date: 31 December 2017  
A total of 484 patients were enrolled, 328 in the randomization portion before crossover, 33 in the 
crossover portion, and 116 in the single-arm, 7 patients were excluded due to consent and local 
regulatory reasons. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was submitted as version 1.0 dated 06 July 2011. Following review by the competent 
authorities changes related to use contraception as an inclusion criterion /Pregnancy and lactation as an 
exclusion criterion and clarifications on the duration of study and the end of study and on the monitoring 
of acute toxicity and on the analysis of the safety data and on handling of the missing data during study 
analysis, were made. The Inter-B-NHL Ritux 2010 study protocol was amended twice by COG and GR and 
1 additional time by GR only; the amendments were as follows: 
Major changes in the protocol amendment 2 were: Adolescents included in secondary objectives; it was 
clarified that the MDD/MRD study was to be done only in the phase III; Haemophilus influenzae was added 
as  a  way  to  assess  normal  B-cell  function.  Some  labs  recognized natural  killer  cells  using  these  2 other 
combinations: CD3- CD56+, or CD3- CD16+CD56+; To add some clarification requested by COG. Those 
clarifications consisted of adding that bone marrow involvement will be defined as less than 25% of blasts 
in the bone marrow, and B AL will be defined as more than 25% blasts; Clarification added for the consent 
procedure as requested by COG, allowing registration before the start of COP at the COG sites; clarification 
points on posology and administration of other medication; the dose to weight was adapted in the guidance 
on the management of infusion related reactions; classification of DLBCL added according to Ann Arbor. 
No major changes occurred in the protocol amendment 3. In amendment 4 an update was included to state 
that the randomization was halted in November 2015 and that all remaining patients under treatment would 
continue treatment with rituximab and clarified that 362 patients were randomized, 181 in each arm; added 
that the study would continue recruitment of an additional 120 patients.  
Other amendments included adjustments to the PIP and including AE’s that were not initially planned to be 
collected  in  the  eCRF.  The  first  planned  interim  analysis  was  performed  august  2015  and  based  on  310 
patients and 27 events. The decision taken by the Steering Committee to stop the trial despite the fact that 
the results from the IA did not cross the specified significance boundary is not understood and hamper the 
assessment of the study.  Variation in the test statistics are expected, in particular when few events are 
included,  and therefore it is  not  appropriate to  stop the trial  if  the  pre-specified  boundary  has not  been 
crossed, pre-specified boundaries are supposed to assure that the type I error of the study is controlled at 
the 5 % level.

Sensitivity analyses 
Event-Free Survival in mITT Set 
In the KM plot of EFS sensitivity analysis performed for the mITT set the adjusted HR was 0.32 (95% CI: 
0.15, 0.66). Kaplan-Meier EFS probabilities over time showed that the EFS probability for patients receiving 
R-Chemo was higher than for those receiving Chemo at Year 1 (94.5% vs. 82.7%) and remained higher at 
Years 2, 3, and 4 (93.9% vs. 82.7% for each time point). For the Chemo mITT set, 27 EFS events were 
reported  vs.  10  for  R-Chemo  mITT  set.  Progression/relapse  was  the  earliest  contributing  event  for  20 
patients (74.1%) in the Chemo mITT set and 3 patients (30.0%) in the R-Chemo mITT set.

The first OS sensitivity analysis KM plot for the mITT set showed consistent results. Twenty patients in the 
Chemo  mITT  arm  and  8  patients  in  the  R-Chemo  mITT  arm  had  died,  and  the  survival  probability  was 
higher for patients in the R-Chemo mITT arm vs. the Chemo mITT arm at Year 1 (97.6% vs. 90.4%), Year 
2 (96.3% vs. 87.1%), and Years 3 and 4 (95.1% vs. 87.1% for both time points). The hazard ratio was 
0.35 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.79).

The  OS  sensitivity  analysis  KM  plot  for  the  expanded  safety  set  showed  consistent  results.  Seventeen 
patients in the Chemo set and 10 patients in the R-Chemo set had died, and the survival probability was 
higher  for  patients  receiving  R-Chemo than  for  patients  receiving  Chemo  at  Year  1  (97.4%  vs.  91.9%), 
Year 2 (95.9% vs. 88.5%), and Years 3 and 4 (94.6% vs. 88.5% at both time points). The hazard ratio is 
0.43 (95% CI:0.20, 0.94). 
Secondary endpoint – CR 
Most patients achieved CR, 93.6% (95% CI: 88.15%, 97.02%) of patients in the Chemo ITT set, 94.0% 
(95% CI: 88.84%, 97.20%) of patients in the R-Chemo ITT set, and 95.4% (95% CI: 92.19%, 97.51%) 
of patients of the rituximab safety set.

CR  rate  at  the  reference assessment  time  is  summarized  by  randomization  arm  for  the  ITT  set  and  the 
rituximab safety set in Table 14.2.2.2. More than half of the patients in the Chemo ITT set (106 patients 
[75.7%]), R-Chemo ITT set (103 patients [69.1%]), and the rituximab safety set (207 patients [73.9%]) 
achieved CR at the reference assessment time. 
Sensitivity Analyses for Complete Remission Rate 
Results of sensitivity analyses of the CR response status performed for the mITT set and for the expanded 
safety set are summarized in Table 14.2.4.3.1 and Table 14.2.4.3.2, respectively.  
In the mITT set, most patients achieved CR: 93.6% of patients of in the Chemo arm and 94.0% of patients 
in the R-Chemo arm. For the expanded safety set, most patients achieved CR: 93.5% of patients receiving 
Chemo and 94.4% of patients receiving R-Chemo.  
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed as follows: 
• Response status by randomization arm, using CRF data only (ITT set), is summarized in Table 14.2.4.3.4. 
This analysis showed 130 patients (92.9%) and 139 patients (93.3%) achieved CR in the Chemo and R-
Chemo arms, respectively. The evaluation of remission at treatment-response assessment times is listed 
by patient in Listing 16.2.6.2.1. Details of the calculation of CR are listed for the ITT set and the rituximab 
safety set in Listing 16.2.6.2.4. 
Therapeutic Group B 
Exploratory endpoint CR in therapeutic Group B is summarized by randomization arm for the therapeutic 
Group  B  response  set  in  Table  14.2.3.1.  For  therapeutic  Group  B,  the  majority  of  patients  achieved  CR 
(97.0% for patients receiving Chemo, 97.2% for patients receiving R-Chemo) as follows: 
• For patients in the Chemo arm: 91.0% early CR, 6.0% slow CR, and 3.0% no CR 
• For patients in the R-Chemo arm: 88.7% early CR, 8.5% slow CR, and 2.8% no CR  
Results of a sensitivity analysis using eCRF data only were the same as in the main analysis.

Supportive study(ies) 
Of 122 patients enrolled in the single-arm portion of the study, data were available for 166 patients. The 
majority of patients achieved CR: 97.0% (95% CI: 91.48%, 99.38%), but neither median EFS or median 
OS was reached. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A multicenter, open-label, randomized study of Lymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy (corticosteroids, 
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide and triple 
drug  [methotrexate/cytarabine/ corticosteroid] intrathecal therapy) alone or in combination with 
MabThera was conducted in paediatric patients with previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive 
DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The application is based on one pivotal randomized phase 3 open label multicenter study BO 25380, where 
rituximab  was  added  to  standard  chemotherapy  in  untreated  pediatric  patients  with  advanced-stage  B-
NHL/B-AL (stage III and LDH > ULN × 2, any stage IV, or B-AL). The in – and exclusion criteria adequately 
define the population covered by the proposed indication. Patients included in the trial were Stage III or 
more at diagnosis. Overall the study was well conducted, however some concerns were raised, which have 
all been addressed. The design of the study, treatments and backbone therapy as well as efficacy endpoints 
are endorsed, no sites were inspected by any regulatory agency.   
Advanced stage is defined as Stage III with elevated LDH level (“B-high”), [LDH > twice the institutional 
upper limit of the adult normal values (> Nx2)] or any stage IV or BAL. Patients were randomized to 
receive either LMB chemotherapy or six IV infusions of MabThera at a dose of 375mg/m2 BSA in 
combination with LMB chemotherapy (two during each of the two induction courses and one during each 
of the two consolidation courses) as per the LMB scheme. A total of 328 randomized patients were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 53/92 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
included in the efficacy analyses, of which one patient under 3 years of age received MabThera in 
combination with LMB chemotherapy. 
The two treatment arms, LMB (LMB chemotherapy) and R-LMB (LMB chemotherapy with MabThera), were 
well balanced with regards to baseline characteristics.  Patients had a median age of 7 and 8 years in the 
LMB arm and R-LMB arm, respectively.  Approximately half of patients were in Group B (50.6% in the 
LMB arm and 49.4% in the R-LMB arm), 39.6% in Group C1 in both arms, and 9.8% and 11.0% were in 
Group C3 in the LMB and R-LMB arms, respectively.  Based on Murphy staging, most patients were either 
BL stage III (45.7% in the LMB arm and 43.3% in the R-LMB arm) or BAL, CNS negative (21.3% in the 
LMB arm and 24.4% in the R-LMB arm). Less than half of the patients (45.1% in both arms) had bone 
marrow involvement, and most patients (72.6% in the LMB arm and 73.2% in the R-LMB arm) had no 
CNS involvement. The primary efficacy endpoint was EFS, where an event was defined as occurrence of 
progressive disease, relapse, second malignancy, death from any cause, or non-response as evidenced by 
detection of viable cells in residue after the second CYVE course, whichever occurs first. The secondary 
efficacy endpoints were OS and CR (complete remission).  
Only one patient below the age of 3 was included in the R-Chemo group. Nonetheless the MAH is proposing 
the use of rituximab in paediatric patients from 6 months and forward. Simulations have been conducted 
with the updated model to predict exposure in children < 3 years. Ctrough and cumulative AUC1-4 cycles are 
comparable across age groups, but Cmax higher in the youngest population. It is agreed that the higher 
Cmax (over) predicted with the model not is expected to have clinical relevance.  Randomization 1:1 to 
chemotherapy with or without rituximab was stratified by National group, histology and therapeutic group, 
the stratification factors are considered acceptable from a clinical point of view, but the MAH was asked to  
clarify whether 6 block randomization were implemented in for the EU countries,  The MAH explained, that 
in the EU countries the treatment arms were assigned by minimization using the TenAlea software. The 
minimization factors were:  national group, histology, and chemotherapy group. An alea parameter of 0.80 
was used, this method prevents the physicians from guessing the assigned treatment arm.  If a potential 
error in the randomization strata was detected, patients were not re-randomized.    
For  the  statistical  analysis,  the  corrected  values  were  used.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  clarify  how  many of 
those values were corrected, and whether using the corrected stratification values instead of the original 
ones could affect the results.  Four patients in the ITT Chemo arm and 1 patient in R-Chemo arm in the ITT 
set (1.5%) had post-randomization corrections to their stratification values. The MAH presented sensitivity 
analysis for OS and EFS were the uncorrected stratification values were used. The results are consistent 
with those presented in the primary analyses. 
The MAH defined two primary analyses for EFS: an unadjusted analysis, comparing survival curves, and an 
analysis  adjusted  on  stratification  factors,  comparing  the  adjusted  HR  estimate  to  1.  The  unadjusted 
analysis  will  consist  in  a  1-sided  non-stratified  log-rank  test.  The  adjusted  treatment  effect  size  will  be 
estimated  by  fitting  a  multivariate  Cox  proportional  hazard  model,  controlling  for  the  national  group, 
histology, and therapeutic groups (pooled strata). The censoring rule is defined as all patients without a 
reported event at the time of the clinical cut-off (31st of Dec 2017) will be censored. As supportive analyses, 
the EFS will be analysed using the m-ITT population and the safety population. Additionally, an analysis 
will be performed using the investigator’s EFS values. Although the definition of EFS is endorsed, it is not 
quit  understood  which  analyses  will  be  considered  the  main  analysis:  the  one  from  the  adjusted  or 
unadjusted model., The MAH clarified that in the PIP and the SAP the results from the (unadjusted) log-
rank analysis are considered the main analysis for regulatory purposes.  In the protocol, the primary efficacy 
endpoint was to be analysed using the adjusted Cox modelling. The interim analysis was performed using 
this multivariate Cox model adjusting for national group, histology, and therapeutic group.  
The Steering Committee decided which events were to be considered EFS events. The MAH did not discuss 
how intercurrent events (e.g. initiation of another therapy, early discontinuation of investigational product, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 54/92 
 
 
  
  
 
early discontinuation of the trial) could affect the EFS analysis. In this analysis, all patients who did not 
have a recorded EFS event at the cut-off date were censored. The assumption of non-informative censoring 
has not been justified. The MAH was asked to: 1) define intercurrent events of interest; 2) disclose how 
many patients had an intercurernt event; 3) present additional sensitivity analyses where the assumption 
of  non-informative  censored  is  not  used  for  patients  who  had  an  intercurrent  event  (administrative 
censoring is acceptable). The MAH was also asked to justify the assumptions made during the analysis and 
compare  the  results  with  those  presented  in  the  primary  analyses.  The  potential  intercurrent  events  of 
interest include early discontinuation of the treatment due to investigator-assessed progression (without 
steering committee confirmation), physician decision, non-response, or intolerable toxicity.  A total of 12 
patients  (6  in  each  arm)  in  the  ITT  set  experienced  a  potential  intercurrent  event.  The  MAH  performed 
several sensitivity analyses: 
Composite strategy 1: The investigator-assessed progression was considered as an EFS event. The HR from 
the adjusted Cox model was 0.35 (90% CI, 0.20 – 0.64). 
Composite strategy 2: All potential intercurrent events, as defined above, were considered as EFS events. 
The Cox HR from this analysis was 0.42 (90% CI, 0.26 – 0.70). 
Treatment policy strategy, all 362 randomized patients were incorporated, including those allowed to cross-
over from Chemo arm to Rituximab arm; the Cox HR from this analysis was 0.4 (90% CI, 0.23 – 0.70). 
All the supplementary / sensitivity analyses gave similar results to those obtained in the primary analysis. 
The secondary endpoints OS and CR are endorsed although they were not controlled for multiplicity. The 
definitions used for the analysis of CR were created based on combination presented in the eCRF, and in 
some cases it was not possible to translate a value registered in the eCRF to a “yes / no” variable.   
It is considered problematic that the CR status could not be clearly obtained from the eCRF and therefore 
a table with correspondence between values was created. The clarified the correspondence table between 
values was created at the time of SAP writing and before CSR analyses.  The study was a open-label study, 
hence the results should be interpreted with caution.  The MAH provided information about the functioning 
of  the  steering  committee.  Data  from  the  clinical  database  were  provided  to  members  of  the  Steering 
Committee without the allocated arms to ensure they were blinded to efficacy.  
In November 2015 the randomization was stopped due to the results from the first IA, although they did 
not cross the specified significance boundary. The results were provided to an independent data monitoring 
committee, who recommended the Sponsor to halt the trial. The Sponsor then made the decision to stop 
the trial. 
The MAH provided details from the IDMC meetings how the decision of stopping the trial despite the lack 
of crossing of the statistical boundary was made. The MAH also provided information about the simulations 
performed  to  calculate  the  probability  that  the  trial  would  have  a  significant  result  in  several  scenarios. 
Conditional power calculations indicated that if the true HR was in the range 0.33-0.73 the trial would be 
expected  to  stop  for  efficacy  with  a  probability  of  87-100  %.  If  the  true  HR  was  1  (no  difference),  the 
probability to stop the trial for efficacy at the final analysis was 60 %. These arguments are acknowledged, 
although the halt of the trial have limited the possibility to obtain a precise estimate of rituximab treatment. 
However, taking into account the limitations of the current trial, the results obtained seem to indicate a 
positive effect of the R-chemo treatment. 
A number of patients switched from their initial treatment group to another, from B to C1 or C1 to C3, this 
was mainly due to lack of response to the pre-phase chemotherapy.    
For  therapeutic  group  C1,  the  MAH  states,  that  36.9%  to  43.1%  had  B-AL,  i.e.  >  25%  blasts,  but  BM 
involvement was reported in 75.4% to 76.9

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 328 randomized patients were included in the efficacy analyses, of which one patient under 3 
years of age received MabThera in combination with LMB chemotherapy. 
The two treatment arms, LMB (LMB chemotherapy) and R-LMB (LMB chemotherapy with MabThera), were 
well balanced with regards to baseline characteristics.  Patients had a median age of 7 and 8 years in the 
LMB arm and R-LMB arm, respectively.  Approximately half of patients were in Group B (50.6% in the 
LMB arm and 49.4% in the R-LMB arm), 39.6% in Group C1 in both arms, and 9.8% and 11.0% were in 
Group C3 in the LMB and R-LMB arms, respectively.  Based on Murphy staging, most patients were either 
BL stage III (45.7% in the LMB arm and 43.3% in the R-LMB arm) or BAL, CNS negative (21.3% in the 
LMB arm and 24.4% in the R-LMB arm). Less than half of the patients (45.1% in both arms) had bone 
marrow involvement, and most patients (72.6% in the LMB arm and 73.2% in the R-LMB arm) had no 
CNS involvement. The primary efficacy endpoint was EFS, where an event was defined as occurrence of 
progressive disease, relapse, second malignancy, death from any cause, or non-response as evidenced by 
detection of viable cells in residue after the second CYVE course, whichever occurs first. The secondary 
efficacy endpoints were OS and CR (complete remission).  
Primary efficacy analyses were performed in 328 randomized patients with a median follow-up of 3.1 
years. At the pre-specified interim analysis with approximately 1 year of median follow-up, clinically 
relevant improvement in the primary endpoint of EFS was observed, with 1-year rate estimates of 94.2% 
(95% CI, 88.5% - 97.2%) in the R-LMB arm vs. 81.5% (95% CI, 73.0% - 87.8%) in the LMB arm, and 
adjusted Cox HR 0.33 (95% CI, 0.14 – 0.79). Upon IDMC (independent data monitoring committee) 
recommendation based on this result, the randomization was halted and patients in the LMB arm were 
allowed to cross over to receive MabThera.  The study met its primary endpoint with a statistically 
significant difference in favour of R-Chemo, 3 year EFS rate was 93.9% in the R-Chemo ITT group 
compared with 82.3% in the Chemo ITT group, (HR 0.32, 90% CI: 0.17, 0.58; p = 0.0010). Median EFS 
was not reached in either treatment group and Kaplan-Meier analyses of EFS were supportive.  
The results of the second EFS sensitivity analysis were consisted with the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
results with an adjusted HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.70). Both investigator and the Steering Committee 
reported 28 EFS events in the R-Chemo arm, but number of events in the Chemo arm was 11 by investigator 
and 10 according to the Steering Committee Central Review, this did not affect the HR in a meaningful way. 
Progression/relapse was reported in 21 patients (75.0%) in the Chemo group vs. 3 patients (30.0%) in the 
R-Chemo  group.  Two  patients  had  secondary  malignancies  in  the  R-Chemo  arm  vs.  none  in  the  Chemo 
arm. No difference was reported for number of toxic deaths. 
Overall survival showed a clinical meaningful benefit for patients in the R-Chemo group compared with the 
Chemo group, adjusted HR being 0.36 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.81). 
At the clinical cutoff, 20 and 8 patients had died in the Chemo and R-Chemo group respectively. Lymphoma 
was the most frequently reported cause of death, 14 patients died in the Chemo ITT arm and 3 in the R-
Chemo  ITT  arm.  In  the  safety  section,  Table  32,  the  number  of  patients  who  died  of  lymphoma  in  the 
Chemo arm is reported to be 13, this table only concerns deaths per actual treatment received. Overall 
survival in mITT and the Expanded Safety Set were consistent.  
About 94% of the patients in both treatment groups, achieved CR, overall no major difference in numbers 
of patients achieving CR was noted between the two treatment groups. Considering the difference in EFS 
favouring the R-Chemo arm it would be expected, that more patients in the R-Chemo arm achieved CR. 
In clinical practice it is considered important to achieve CR, since these patients usually are better off 
than patients who do not achieve CR.

The unmet medical need in this rare condition is clear for the entire paediatric population. In clinical 
practice, rituximab is used in the EU paediatric community in paediatric B-NHL and the proposed dose of 
375 mg/m2 is the dose referred to in the various published papers. However, only one patient below 3 
years was included in the study, but the MAH har adequately provided an extrapolation, updated the 
adult NHL model and included a maturation factor to the constant clearance component to take into 
account the effect of the FcRn variation with age. The time independent clearance component is mostly 
dependent on B-cell count and tumour size and these are not expected to be linked to maturation. Values 
for covariates have been taken from the literature. The Applicant has adequately justified why a PBPK 
model not would be expected to provide additional information compared to the updated population PK 
mode (see discussion on Clinical Pharmacology). Simulations have been conducted with the updated 
model to predict exposure in children < 3 years. A BSA adjusted rituximab dose is appropriate also in 
children < 3 years of age and an extension of the indication B-NHL indication to the age group 6 months 
to 3 years can be accepted despite lack of clinical PK data in the age group. 
As CD20 negative patients were excluded from the study, the wording of the indication was amended to 
reflect this - this is consistent with the adult indication.   
The following indication is agreed: MabThera in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the 
treatment of paediatric patients (aged ≥ 6 months  to < 18 years old) with previously untreated 
advanced stage CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt 
leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL). 
The recommended initial rate for infusion is 0.5 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 mg/h); it can be escalated by 0.5 
mg/kg/h every 30 minutes if there is no hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions, to a maximum of 
400 mg/h. Subsequent doses of MabThera can be infused at an initial rate of 1 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 
mg/h); it can be increased by 1 mg/kg/h every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/h. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall the study met its primary endpoint with a clinical meaningful and statistically significant effect of 
rituximab in combination with chemotherapy on EFS in paediatric patients with advanced NHL.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
For completeness, AE data (including tabulations) provided in Section 7 of this CSR also summarize AEs 
that occurred in patients who received any dose of rituximab, including those who crossed-over from the 
Chemo treatment group following the interim analysis. However, given the variable exposure to rituximab 
among patients in this group, AE counts for the “Rituximab safety set” should not be compared with those 
shown  in  the  “Chemo  safety  set”  and  “R-Chemo  safety  set.”  For  the  evaluation  of  safety,  the  following 
defines each group presented. 
•  Chemo safety set, N = 153, patients from the randomized portion of the trial who received chemotherapy 
courses beyond initial COP course and no doses of rituximab 
•  R-Chemo safety set, N = 162, patients from the randomized portion of the trial only, this excludes any 
patient who crossed over to R therapy when crossover was permitted 
•  Initial COP only safety set, N = 7, patients withdrawn from study treatment scheme before   initiation 
of induction course.

•  Rituximab safety set, N = 309, this was any patient who received at least one dose of rituximab, which 
includes patients from the randomized portion of the trial (R-Chemo safety set 162 patients), plus the 
31  patients  who  were  eligible  to  cross  over  (2  patients  of  the  crossover  over  part  did  not  receive 
rituximab) and 116 patients from the single-arm open- label portion of the study.

Late AEs 
The large majority of patients did not experience a late AE. Five patients (3.3%) in the Chemo safety set 
and 11 patents (6.8%) in the R-Chemo safety set experienced at least 1 late AE, and 18 patients (5.8%) 
in the rituximab safety set experienced at least 1 late AE. In the Initial COP(s) only safety set, 3 patients 
(42.9%) experienced at least 1 late AE. Four patients in the R-Chemo set experienced late effects in the 
SOC of infections and infestations vs. none in the Chemo set. Three patients in the Chemo set and 1 patient 
in the R-Chemo set were diagnosed with neoplasm. All of these events corresponded to the deaths of these 
4  patients  related  to  lymphoma  progression.  Two  patients  in  the  RChemo  set  experienced  second 
malignancy (reported as “uncoded” term in Table 30) vs. none in the Chemo set. The remaining late effects 
were observed in only 1 or 2 patients in the Chemo and R-Chemo safety sets.

Secondary malignancies 
There  were  2  secondary  malignancies  reported  in  the  study,  both  in  the  R-Chemo  arm  (melanoma  and 
histiocytic sarcoma). The event of melanoma was reported in a therapeutic Group B patient who had a pre-
existing  skin  nevus  which  rapidly  progressed  after  the  patient  started  study  treatment.  The  event  of 
melanoma was reported in a therapeutic Group B patient who had a pre-existing skin nevus which rapidly 
progressed after the patient started study treatment. The histiocytic sarcoma was diagnosed 16.6 months 
after randomization in a therapeutic Group C3 patient and was fatal (death occurred 1 year after diagnosis).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Seventeen deaths were reported in the Chemo safety set, of which 13 were due to lymphoma, 2 were due 
to toxicity of first-line inter B-NHL trial treatment, 1 was due to toxicity of subsequent treatment, and 1 
was unknown. For the R-Chemo safety set, 8 deaths were reported as follows: 3 due to lymphoma, 2 due 
to  toxicity  of  first-line  inter  B-NHL  trial  treatment,  1  due  to  toxicity  of  subsequent  treatment,  1  due  to 
second  malignancy,  and  1  due  to  “other”  (patient  3-C-23:  sepsis  during  chemotherapy)  that  was  also 
considered  by  the  steering  committee  review  a  toxic  death  related  to  the  first-line  inter  B-NHL  trial 
treatment. Narratives for toxic deaths are provided in Section 10.3.3. In the Initial COP only safety set, 3 
deaths were reported: 2 related to lymphoma and 1 due to “other” cause (patient 3-C-68: sepsis during 
chemotherapy) that was considered by the steering committee review a toxic death related to the first-line 
inter B-NHL trial treatment. All these 3 patients were initially randomized to the Chemo arm.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No summary of patients who had AEs that led to rituximab dose reduction is provided as this data were not 
collected on the study case report forms. However, a review of individual SAE cases was done to identify 
SAEs  that  led  to  rituximab  withdrawal.  This  review  identified  7  patients  with  SAEs  that  led  to  rituximab 
withdrawal.  
Post marketing experience 
Company Global Safety Database 
A total of 371 cases reporting 851 AEs in pediatric patients (<18 years of age) across all oncology indications 
from the company global safety database were analyzed. The majority of the AEs were reported in children 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 79/92 
 
 
  
  
 
(>2 years to >12 years of age [48.4%]) and adolescents (>12 years to <18 years of age [48.3%]), and 
the safety profile of MabThera/Rituxan was comparable between these two age groups. Only 3.3% of AEs 
were reported in infants and neonates (<2 years of age). 
A total of 203 cases (54.7%) reporting 427 AEs (50.2%) were from the NHL indication. Of these 427 AEs, 
263 (61.6%) were known ADRs  for MabThera/Rituxan in the adult population, such as IRRs and related 
signs/symptoms,  infections,  and  hypogammaglobulinemia  (immunoglobulins  below  the  lower  limit  of 
normal). Of the remaining 164 AEs (bone marrow failure, death, product use issue, drug ineffective etc.) 
not known as ADRs in adult patients, 137 (83.5%) were associated with clear alternative explanations and 
risk factors and the remaining 27 (16.5%) had insufficient information for an adequate assessment. 
From the total of 851 AEs analyzed, 77 (9.0%) fatal AEs were reported, of which one was in CLL, and 38 
each were in NHL and other oncology indications (i.e., posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Epstein-
Barr  virus  associated  lymphoproliferative  disorder,  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia,  Hodgkin’s  disease  etc.). 
Approximately 25% of these fatal events were related to infections (sepsis, aspergillus infection, unspecified 
infection etc.). 
The safety profile of MabThera/Rituxan observed in the pediatric population was overall consistent with the 
well-established safety profile in the adult population for the approved oncology indications as provided in 
the Core Data Sheet (CDS) Version 31.0. The AEs that were not known ADRs of MabThera/Rituxan either 
had alternative explanations and risk factors or had insufficient information for an adequate assessment. 
Overall, the reporting ratio of AEs was highest from the SOC Infections and infestations (N=72, 16.9%), 
and was followed by: 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (N=62, 14.5%) 
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders (N=49, 11.5%) 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (N=42, 9.8%) 
•  Nervous system disorders (N=36, 8.4%) 
•  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (N=29, 6.8%) 
•  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (N= 27, 6.3%) 
The PTs reported in these SOCs were either in line with an identified risk or ADR (as per the Undesirable 
Effects  listed  in  CDS  Version  31.0)  of  MabThera/Rituxan  in  adult  patients  (IRRs,  infections  and 
hypogammaglobulinemia) or  were  related  to  the  underlying  condition  and/or  associated  to  the  potential 
effects of past/concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. 
Literature Review 
Overall, review of the relevant literature did not provide new safety findings or any new safety information 
to what is already known for the safety profile of rituximab in adult patients. Of the 683 articles retrieved 
from  the  literature  search,  33  were  found  to  be  relevant  (i.e.,  articles  that  provided  safety  findings  in 
pediatric  patients  exposed  to  rituximab)  for  inclusion.  The  majority  of  the  reported  AEs  (e.g.  infections, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, IRRs) were consistent with the safety findings from the data retrieved from the 
company  global  safety  database  for  pediatric  patients,  and  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
MabThera/Rituxan in adults for the approved oncology indications. 
The  comparisons  between  the  pediatric  safety  data  in  Study  BO25380  to  the  rituximab  adult  oncology 
population  were  limited  by  the  relatively  small  size  of  the  pediatric  population  compared  with  the  adult 
population, the AE reporting requirements in Study BO25380, and the differences in disease biology and 
background  treatments  between  populations.  Additionally,  the  analyses  in  the  DSR  were  not  based  on 
actual exposure data, there were differences in the source of adult and pediatric data (largely clinical trials 
in adults versus largely post-marketing data in the pediatric population). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 80/92 
 
 
  
  
However,  despite  this,  the  safety  profile  of  MabThera/Rituxan  observed  in  the  pediatric  population  was 
overall consistent with the well-established safety profile in the adult populations for the approved oncology 
indications as provided in the CDS Version 31.0. 
The AEs that were not known ADRs of MabThera/Rituxan either had alternative explanations and risk factors 
or had insufficient information for an adequate assessment. 
Therefore, based on the analysis of the data in the company global safety database in pediatric oncology 
patients treated with MabThera/Rituxan, it was concluded that observed safety profile of 
MabThera/Rituxan in the pediatric population appeared to be consistent with that in adult patients. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A multicenter, open-label randomized study of Lymphome Malin B chemotherapy (LMB) with or without 
MabThera was conducted in paediatric patients (aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years old) with previously 
untreated advanced stage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL.  
Overall, a significant number of paediatric patients with NHL have been exposed to R-chemo for a significant 
period of time. This should enable a thorough assessment of the safety aspects of this combination in the 
proposed patient population.  
A total of 309 paediatric patients received MabThera and were included in the safety analysis population. 
Paediatric patients randomized to the LMB chemotherapy arm with MabThera, or enrolled in the single 
arm part of the study, were administered MabThera at a dose of 375mg/m2 BSA and received a total of 
six IV infusions of MabThera (two during each of the two induction courses and one during each of the 
two consolidation courses of the LMB scheme).  
The  most  common  AEs  occurred  in  the  SOC  “blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders”,  where  febrile 
neutropenia was the most common AE. Furthermore, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy leads to 
an increased risk of AEs, especially in terms of gastrointestinal disorders (stomatitis, enteritis), infections 
(sepsis),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (hypokalemia  and  decreased  appetite),  and  investigations 
(ALAT and ASAT increase). The increased risk of infection in children is now reflected in the SmPC. 
It is clearly seen that the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy also leads to an increased risk of Grade 4-
5  AEs  in  terms  of  sepsis,  liver  enzyme  increase  (ALAT/ASAT),  stomatitis  and  febrile  neutropenia. 
Unfortunately, laboratory data were not collected on the study eCRF, and thus it is not possible to confirm 
if any of the patients fulfilled the criteria for Hy’s law. However, there no clinical signs or symptoms that 
would seem to indicate that a given patient have experienced DILI.  
There were two secondary malignancies in the study, both in the R-chemo arm. The MAH has provided brief 
case  narratives.  As  mentioned  by  the  MAH,  NHL  patients  are  known  to  be  at  higher  risk  for  secondary 
malignancies.  There  have  been  case  reports  of  melanoma  in  adult  patients,  while  the  case  of  histocytic 
sarcoma  shoed  identical  clonal  anomaly  with  regards  to  the  initial  cancer  (IGH-MYC  fusion).  No  firm 
conclusions can be drawn from such a small number of patients.  
There were fewer deaths in the R-chemo arm compared to the chemo arm, 8 vs 17. Although the numbers 
are  small  and  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  it  is  nonetheless  clinically  encouraging  to  see  this 
numerical difference in favor of R-chemo.  
It is clearly seen that the addition of rituximab to chemo leads to a significant increase in SAEs, 49.5% 
vs. 39.3%. As discussed previously, the differences are mainly seen in terms of infections and 
gastrointestinal disorders. There was only one (late) case of PML in the R-chemo arm compared to 3 
acute cases in the chemo arm. Furthermore, there were no cases of Hepatitis B reactivation in any of the 
arms. This is reassuring, since approximately 35% of the patients had Anti-HBs antibody at baseline.

Data on post-treatment vaccination and persistence of previous antibodies is limited. However, given that 
the disease setting is very serious, in the clinical setting, patient are usually closely monitored and 
vaccinated post-treatment, if they haven’t got all their vaccines. Children that are transplanted are 
usually closely monitored and re-vaccinated after approximately 6 months. Relevant recommendations in 
the SmPC are sufficient. 
In summary, the safety profile of MabThera in paediatric patients (aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years old) 
with previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL was generally consistent in 
type, nature and severity with the known safety profile in adult NHL and CLL patients.    Addition of 
MabThera to chemotherapy did result in an increased risk of some events including infections (including 
sepsis) compared to chemotherapy only.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in a paediatric NHL population 
is as expected, thus in line with previous knowledge and experience. There were no new safety findings. 
However, there is only one patients below the age of 3 in the R-chemo group. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The treatment of paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months to <18 years old) with previously untreated 
advanced stage CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt 
leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite a high cure rate in children and adolescents with NHL, there is an unmet need for improving the 
EFS in paediatric patients with advanced stage NHL. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A multicenter, open-label, randomized study of Lymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy (corticosteroids, 
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide and triple 
drug  [methotrexate/cytarabine/ corticosteroid] intrathecal therapy) alone or in combination with 
MabThera was conducted in paediatric patients with previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive 
DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL. Advanced stage is defined as Stage III with elevated LDH level (“B-high”), [LDH > 
twice the institutional upper limit of the adult normal values (> Nx2)] or any stage IV or BAL. Patients 
were randomized to receive either LMB chemotherapy or six IV infusions of MabThera at a dose of 
375mg/m2 BSA in combination with LMB chemotherapy (two during each of the two induction courses and 
one during each of the two consolidation courses) as per the LMB scheme. A total of 328 randomized 
patients were included in the efficacy analyses, of which one patient under 3 years of age received 
MabThera in combination with LMB chemotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the pre-specified interim analysis with approximately 1 year of median follow-up, clinically relevant 
improvement in the primary endpoint of EFS was observed, with 1-year rate estimates of 94.2% (95% 
CI, 88.5% - 97.2%) in the R-LMB arm vs. 81.5% (95% CI, 73.0% - 87.8%) in the LMB arm, and 
adjusted Cox HR 0.33 (95% CI, 0.14 – 0.79). Upon IDMC (independent data monitoring committee) 
recommendation based on this result, the randomization was halted and patients in the LMB arm were 
allowed to cross over to receive MabThera. The study met its primary endpoint, a statistically significant 
and clinically relevant improvement of 3-year EFS was shown in favour of R-Chemo, 3-year EFS rate was 
93.9% in the R-Chemo ITT group compared with 82.3% in the Chemo ITT group, (HR 0.32, 90% CI: 
0.17, 0.58; p = 0.0010). Median EFS was not reached in either treatment group and Kaplan-Meier 
analyses of EFS were supportive.  
The results of the second EFS sensitivity analysis were consisted with the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
results with an adjusted HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.70). 
Progression/relapse was reported in 21 patients (75.0%) in the Chemo group vs. 3 patients (30.0%) in the 
R-Chemo  group.  Two  patients  had  secondary  malignancies  in  the  R-Chemo  arm  vs.  none  in  the  Chemo 
arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133144/2020 
Page 89/92 
 
 
  
  
Overall survival showed a clinical meaningful benefit for patients in the R-Chemo group compared with 
the Chemo group, adjusted HR being 0.36 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.81) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties about the favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  most  common  AEs  occurred  in  the  SOC  “blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders”,  where  febrile 
neutropenia  was  the  most  common  AE.  The  addition  of  rituximab  to  chemotherapy  also  leads  to  an 
increased  risk  of  AEs,  especially  in  terms  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  (stomatitis,  enteritis),  infections 
(sepsis),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (hypokalemia  and  decreased  appetite),  and  investigations 
(ALAT and ASAT increase).  
The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy also leads to an increased risk of  Grade 4-5 AEs in terms of 
sepsis, liver enzyme increase (ALAT/ASAT), stomatitis and febrile neutropenia.  
The addition of rituximab to chemo leads to a significant increase in SAEs, 49.5% vs. 39.3%. As 
discussed previously, the differences are mainly seen in terms of infections and gastrointestinal disorders. 
There was only one (late) case of PML in the R-chemo arm compared to 3 acute cases in the chemo arm. 
Furthermore, there were no cases of Hepatitis B reactivation in any of the arms. This is reassuring, since 
approximately 35% of the patients had positive Anti-HBs antibody at baseline. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no uncertainties about the unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Adding rituximab to standard chemotherapy in advanced B-NHL results in a significant and clinically relevant 
increase of 3-year EFS. These results are important, although assessment of the study was hampered by 
the  fact  that  the  study  was  stopped  at  the  first  interim  analysis,  despite  it  did  not  cross  the  specified 
significance boundary. The safety profile of rituximab is well known from the use in the adult population 
and considered manageable. Overall the safety profile of rituximab was consistent with the known safety 
profile in adults, no new safety signals were raised. Only one patient below the age of 3 was included in 
the R-Chemo group, this has adequately been reflected in the SmPC.  
The proposed indication is intended to be in children from 6 months of age, however, no PK data are 
available in children in the age group 6 month to 3 years of age to support or justify the 375 mg/m2 dose 
in this age group.  The MAH has performed simulations using a model to predict exposure in children <3 
years. Ctrough and cumulative AUC1-4 cycles are comparable across age groups, but Cmax higher in the 
youngest population. It is agreed that the higher Cmax (over) predicted with the model not is expected to 
have clinical relevance. This is supported by paediatric rituximab data from other indications. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite a high cure rate in children and adolescent with B-NHL, a further improvement of EFS is needed 
especially in the advanced-stage NHL, therefore the benefit of adding rituximab to standard chemotherapy 
in advanced B-NHL results in a significant and clinically relevant increase of 3-year EFS is significant.  
The  safety  profile  of  rituximab  is  well  known  from  the  use  in  the  adult  population  and  considered 
manageable. Overall the safety profile of rituximab was consistent with the known safety profile in adults, 
no new safety signals were raised. Only one patient below the age of 3 was included in the R-Chemo group, 
this has adequately been reflected in the SmPC.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Mabthera in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of paediatric patients 
(aged ≥6 months  to <18 years old) with previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute 
leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL), is positive.

(BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL) in 
combination with chemotherapy for MabThera; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 
of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 21 of the RMP has also 
been submitted. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0064/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that MabThera is not similar to Kymriah, Yescarta and Polivy 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular, the EPAR module 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

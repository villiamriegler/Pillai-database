1. 
Introduction 
Avastin  (bevacizumab)  is  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody.  It  recognizes  and 
neutralizes all major isoforms of human VEGF. Bevacizumab potently neutralizes VEGF and blocks 
its signal transduction through both the VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 receptors. It inhibits angiogenesis by 
neutralizing all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), and blocking their 
binding to VEGF receptors. 
Avastin was approved in EU in January 2005 for the first-line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the 
colon or rectum in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid or intravenous 5- 
fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan.  Subsequently Avastin was also approved for use in combination 
with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer and  in addition to 
platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable 
advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell 
histology and in combination with interferon alfa-2a for first line treatment of patients with advanced 
and/or metastatic renal cell cancer.  
The applicant has now submitted two randomised phase III studies: 
•  Study  NO16966,  in  patients  not  previously  treated  for  their  metastatic  disease,  was  a 
randomised  double-blind  phase  III  study  with  Progression  free  survival  as  primary  endpoint 
with  the  two  objectives  to  show  non-inferiority  of  XELOX  to  FOLFOX-4  and  to  show 
superiority  of  bevacizumab  +  chemotherapy  over  chemotherapy  alone.  The  mature  overall 
survival  data  for  this  study  was  submitted  in  the  responses  to  request  for  supplementary 
information.  
•  Study E3200 evaluating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab given either in combination 
with  FOLFOX-4  or  as  monotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  carcinoma  of  the  colon  or 
rectum who had received previous treatment with irinotecan and 5-FU. Overall survival was 
the primary endpoint. 
As supportive data the applicant has submitted the following: 
•  Addenda to the clinical studies AVF2107g and AVF2192g reported in the original marketing 
authorisation application in order to provide more safety data. 
•  PK  data  from  two  drug-drug  interaction  studies  AVF3135g  (Already  assessed  as  FUM  016 
and finalised at the January 2007 meeting) and NP18587 concerning the potential interactions 
between bevacizumab and irinotecan, capecitabine or oxaliplatin.  
•  Publications and reports of several other trials, conducted by Roche and other sponsors.  
These studies form the basis for the following extension of the indication concerning mCRC: 
«Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy with intravenous 
5-fluorouracil/folinic acid or intravenous 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan is indicated for first-line 
treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum». 
The proposed posology to follow this indication is: 
The recommended dose of Avastin, administered  as an intravenous infusion, is either 5 mg/kg or 
10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given 
once every 3 weeks.

Clinical aspects 
Study NO16966 was conducted according to the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Clinical 
audits  were  conducted  at  selected  sites  by  the  Clinical  Quality  Assurance  Department  of  Roche  to 
evaluate  study  compliance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines  and  relevant  local  regulations. 
There were no critical findings affecting the overall validity of study at any of the sites audited.  
Study E3200 was conducted according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) standard 
operating procedures, and in accordance with all Department of Health and Human Services, Office of 
Human  Research  Protections,  and  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  regulations  regarding 
the conduct of human research that gave their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  two  drug  interaction  studies  (AVF3135g  and  NP1857)  were  also  conducted  in  accordance  to 
GCP. 
2. 1. 
Clinical Pharmacology 
The results of the clinical pharmacology program for bevacizumab have been extensively discussed in 
the original Marketing Authorization Application for first-line treatment of colorectal cancer and the 
type  II  variation  for  metastatic  breast  carcinoma  (EMEA/H/C/582/II/08)  and  non-small  cell  lung 
cancer (EMEA/H/C/582/II/09).  
In this submission two drug-drug interaction studies has been included for which the one already has 
been assessed as a follow up measure:  
•  AVF3135g:  investigated  the  potential  effect  of  bevacizumab  on  irinotecan  disposition  and 
demonstrated that bevacizumab had no effect on the disposition of irinotecan and SN38. This 
study was already assessed as Follow-up measure (FUM) and included in this submission as 
some  SPC  changes  relating  to  the  outcome  of  this  FUM  have  been  introduced  into  the 
proposed SPC.  
•  NP18587  concerning  the  potential  interactions  between  bevacizumab,  capecitabine  or 
oxaliplatin.  The  conclusion  for  this  study  was  that  Bevacizumab  did  not  alter  the 
pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and oxaliplatin. A previous study had shown not effect on 
the  pharmacokinetics  of  irinotecan.  Hence,  there  are  no  concerns  regarding  any  of  the  drug 
combinations in the two pivotal trials for the present application. 
2.2.  
Clinical Efficacy  
This  application  is  supported  by  two  large,  randomized  Phase  III  studies,  one  in  patients  not 
previously treated for their metastatic disease (first-line treatment, Study NO16966) and the other in 
previously  treated  patients  (second-line  treatment,  Study  E3200).  Supportive  efficacy  and  safety 
information is provided from a number of additional published studies. A description of study designs 
and objectives of the two key studies is provided in the table below.

Study NO16966 
Study  NO16966  was  a  multinational,  randomized,  double-blind  (for  bevacizumab)  Phase  III  study. 
The study was originally designed to demonstrate that the combination of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin 
(XELOX)  is  similarly  effective  to  the  combination  of  oxaliplatin  plus  5-FU/LV  (FOLFOX4).  After 
publication  of  the  results  of  the  bevacizumab  pivotal  study  AVF2107g,  demonstrating  a  superior 
survival benefit through the addition of bevacizumab to irinotecan + bolus 5FU/FA (IFL), the addition 
of  bevacizumab  was  requested  by  the  independent  steering  committee  members  and  accepted  by 
Roche. The study design was changed to a 2x2 factorial randomized phase III trial in order to address 
an additional primary objective i.e., superiority for PFS of XELOX/FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab versus 
XELOX/FOLFOX-4 + placebo.

Co-primary objectives:  
•  To  demonstrate  that  the  combination  of  capecitabine  and  oxaliplatin  (XELOX)  with  or 
without  bevacizumab  (BV)  is  at  least  equivalent  to  the  combination  of  fluorouracil  and 
leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) with or without BV in terms of PFS. . 
•  To  demonstrate  that  BV  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (XELOX+BV/FOLFOX-4+BV) 
is superior to chemotherapy alone (XELOX+P/FOLFOX-4+P) in terms of PFS.

Secondary endpoints: 
•  PFS based on tumour assessments reviewed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) 
•  PFS  on-treatment  (based  on  investigator  tumour  assessments  during  and  up  to  28  days  after 
last drug intake in the primary study treatment phase [i.e., the first 48 weeks of treatment]) 
•  Overall survival  
•  PFS based on investigator tumour assessments, patients with surgery with curative intent not 
censored 
•  Best overall response (BOR) based on investigator tumour assessments 
•  Best  overall  response  (BOR)  based  on  tumour  assessments  reviewed  by  an  Independent 
Review Committee (IRC) 
•  Time to response 
•  Duration of response 
•  Time to treatment failure 
•  Safety 
No data on QoL has been collected. Patients were asked to complete a Chemotherapy convenience and 
Satisfaction Questionnaire at baseline and then every second cycle. However the Convenience domain 
of the Questionnaire failed validation and therefore results were not included in the study report.  
Study Participants & Inclusion/Exclusion criterias 
The  target  population  for  the  NO16966  study  was  patients  with  inoperable  mCRC,  who  had  not 
previously  received  systemic  treatment  for  metastatic  disease.  Treatment  groups  were  well-balanced 
with  respect  to  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  and  generally  representative  of  the 
overall population of patients with mCRC: in the 2x2 factorial part of the study, the median age was 
approximately 60 years (range 18 to 86 years), the majority were male (58%), Caucasian (88%), had a 
high ECOG performance status of 0 (59%), and had liver metastases (76%) at baseline. In total, 24% 
of patients had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy.  
Main inclusion criteria were: ECOG performance status of ≤1, histologically confirmed 
adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum with metastatic disease, at least one unidimensionally 
measurable lesion with a diameter >20 mm using conventional CT or MRI scans or >10 mm using 
spiral CT scans,  a life expectancy of at least 3 months. 
Main exclusion criteria were: Prior treatment with oxaliplatin, bevacizumab or other systemic therapy 
for advanced or metastatic disease; History of another malignancy within the last five years ; history or 
evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease; Clinically significant (ie., active) cardiovascular 
disease. 
A total of 2035 patients from 32 countries were randomized (634 patients in the 2-arm part and 1401 
in  the  2x2  factorial  part  of  the  study).  While  overall  survival  data  for  the  first  part  of  the  study  are 
mature at the time of intial submission, 64-70% of patients having a death event, this was not yet the 
case for the 2x2 factorial part of the study with only 32-37% of the patients having a death event. In 
the  mature  overall  survival  (OS)  data  from  part  II  of  NO16966,  62.5%  patients  have  died,  after  an 
analysis performed with an additional 12 months of follow-up (34% of patients had died at the cut-off 
for the primary analysis). 
Baseline data 
Demographic and prognostic data (e.g. ECOG performance status, time from diagnosis of colorectal 
cancer  to  randomization)  were  generally  well  balanced  within  the  initial  2-arm  part  I  of  the  study 
between the FOLFOX-4 and XELOX treatment arms, as well as within the 2x2 factorial part II of the 
study across the FOLFOX-4 and XELOX-containing arms.  
Demographic and prognostic data were also well balanced between the initial 2-arm part and the 2x2 
factorial  part  of  the  study,  with  the  following  exceptions:  The  proportion  of  Caucasian  patients  that 
enrolled in the 2x2 factorial part was higher than the initial 2-arm part because centers in China did not 
participate in the 2x2 factorial part of the study. An increase of approximately 10% was observed in 
the percentages of patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 in the 2x2 factorial part compared 
with patients in the initial 2-arm part of the study.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  demographic  data,  patient  prognostic  factors  and  baseline  tumour  characteristics  as  well  as 
adjuvant chemotherapy were sufficiently balanced between the treatment arms.  
Treatments 
The combination of capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily given on an intermittent schedule (2 weeks 
of treatment followed by 1 week without treatment) with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 given once on day 1 
every  3  weeks  was  shown  to  be  tolerable  and  feasible.  The  choice  of  dosages  of  the  standard 
chemotherapy  (oxaliplatin  plus  5-FU/LV)  was  based  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  the 
FOLFOX-4 regimen which is an approved standard regimen in the US and Europe, and using a similar 
planned dose intensity of oxaliplatin in the two selected regimens. 
In Study NO16966, Bevacizumab was given at a dose intensity of 2.5 mg/kg/week, consistent with the 
current prescribing information, where a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks (2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent) 
is recommended for the treatment of mCRC. The dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks was selected for the 
original Phase III pivotal trial in first-line metastatic CRC (Study AVF2107g) and study AVF2192g 
based  on  the  results  of  the  dose-finding  Study  AVF0780g.  The  pivotal  study  AVF2107g  and  Study 
AVF2192g  generated  data  confirming  the  appropriateness  of  the  5  mg/kg  every  2  weeks  dosing 
interval (in terms of the PFS and OS benefit) and are the basis for the current dosing recommendation 
in mCRC. 
Efficacy Results in First-line Study NO16966 
•  Patient flow 
In the primary treatment phase (first 48 weeks of treatment), more patients stopped treatment due to 
disease  progression  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  arms  (44%  and  50%)  than  in  the  chemotherapy+BV 
arms (29%). A higher proportion of patients had adverse events in the BV treatment arms that led to 
discontinuation (31% and 33% vs. 22% and 21%).  
These data show that after the primary treatment phase, few patients continued bevacizumab treatment 
until disease progression, although allowed in the protocol. For the initial 2-arm part of the study, the 
first patient was randomised on 15 July 2003 and the last patient was randomised on 7 May 2004. In 
the 2x2 factorial part of the study, the first patient was randomised on 4 February 2004 and the last 
patient was randomised on 10 February 2005. The protocol of January 2003, NO16966, was amended 
five times. The amendment that allowed adding the 2x2 factorial part of the study, investigating the 
addition of bevacizumab to either FOLFOX-4 or XELOX was applied early in the study. None of the 
amendments are considered to negatively affect the validity of the study. 
Of the 1400 patients in the ITT population of the 2x2 factorial part of the study, 250 patients had one 
or more protocol deviations, approximately 60 in each treatment arm.  
•  Results 2x2 Factorial 4-arm part of the study 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Progression-free survival – General approach 
The two co-primary objectives of the study were met:   
•  Non-inferiority  of  the  XELOX  containing  arms  versus  FOLFOX-4  containing  arms  was 
demonstrated for the primary analysis of PFS in the EPP (HR = 1.05; 97.5%CI, 0.94-1.18). This 
result was supported by the analysis of OS (HR = 0.97; 97.5% CI, 0.84-1.14), BOR and TTF, and 
by a prognostic factor-adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis. 
•  Superiority  of  FOLFOX-4/XELOX+BV  over  FOLFOX-4/XELOX+P  was  demonstrated  in  the 
primary PFS analysis in the ITT population (HR = 0.83; 97.5% CI, 0.72-0.95; p=0.0023), which 
was  supported  by  consistent  results  derived  from  the  pre-defined  PFS  on  treatment  analysis  and 
the PFS analysis resulting from the pre-defined independent review process. The robustness of the 
analysis  was  further  confirmed  by  a  prognostic  factor-adjusted  multivariate  Cox  regression 
analysis. Superiority of chemotherapy + BV over chemotherapy + placebo was demonstrated. The 
Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS shows an early separation suggesting an early effect of the combined 
biologic therapy.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  PFS based on tumour assessment reviewed by an independent review committee (IRC) 
For calculation of PFS in the analysis of IRC tumour assessments: 
• Tumour scans taken up to and including disease progression or until study week 60, whichever came 
first, were to be sent to the IRC for independent review and assessment of response, including PD. 
• Only PD as assessed by the IRC were considered as PD events 
• Deaths (without prior PD) that occurred within 28 days from the last tumour assessment reviewed by 
the IRC were considered as death events  
• Surgery with curative intent was taken into account for censoring only if it occurred within 28 days 
from the last tumour assessment made by the IRC. 
Superiority of the BV containing arms compared with the placebo-containing arms was demonstrated 
for PFS in the ITT for the overall comparison and the treatment subgroup comparisons when tumor 
assessments were independently reviewed by the IRC. 
PFS as assessed by the IRC was prolonged by a median of 76 days in the chemotherapy+bevacizumab 
arm  compared  to  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  (HR=0.70,  97.5%  CI  [0.58;  0.83],  p<0.0001).  In  the 
XELOX and FOLFOX-4 treatment subgroups the PFS was prolonged by a median of 61 (HR=0.73, 
97.5%  CI  [0.57;  0.95],  p=0.0071)  and  72  days  (HR=0.66,  97.5%  CI  [0.52;  0.85],  p=0.0002), 
respectively.  Thus,  addition  of  bevacizumab  significantly  prolonged  PFS  in  both  chemotherapy 
subgroup  arms.  Contrary  to  the  PFS  analysis  by  the  investigator,  defined  as  the  primary  endpoint, 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there was a benefit of adding bevacizumab also to the FOLFOX-4 arm in the IRC analysis. In the IRC 
analysis, the differences in PFS between the bevacizumab and placebo arms were greater than in the 
primary analysis. This is  not surprising since patients who withdraw and subsequently die >28 days 
after last date of tumour assessment are censored and do not contribute with an event. Discrepancy in 
the number of events between the IRC and the investigator analyses is due to the definition of event 
and lower number of available tumour scans as well as discrepancy between the IRC and investigators 
assessment of PFS. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  plots  of  PFS  based  on  IRC  assessments  in  the  ITT  population  show  an  early 
separation of the curves, with the BV curve above the placebo curve for the overall comparison and 
the two treatment subgroup comparisons. These analyses support the analyses of the primary endpoint. 
Superiority of BV versus placebo was demonstrated in the overall comparison (figure 4a) and in both 
XELOX and FOLFOX-4 treatment subgroups (figure 4c and figure 4b, respectively), thus supporting 
the main superiority analysis of the study. Unlike the results in the investigator dataset, the result of 
the comparison of FOLFOX-4+BV versus FOLFOX-4+P was significant in the IRC dataset.

PFS On-treatment Approach 
A greater magnitude of PFS benefit with BV was seen in the on-treatment analysis compared with the 
primary PFS analysis (general approach) and was statistically significant in the pooled comparison and 
the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 treatment subgroup comparisons: chemotherapy + BV was significantly 
superior  to  chemotherapy  alone  (HR = 0.63;  97.5%  CI,  0.52-0.75;  p  <0.0001)  and  statistical 
superiority was achieved in both treatment subgroups (HR=0.61; 97.5% CI, 0.48-0.78; p<0.0001 for 
the  XELOX  treatment  subgroup  comparison  and  HR=0.65;  97.5%  CI,  0.50-0.84;  p=0.0002  for  the 
FOLFOX-4  treatment  subgroup  comparison).  These  results  support  the  conclusions  of  the  primary 
analysis. 
PFS Patients with Curative Surgery not Censored 
The  number  of  patients  censored  in  the  PFS  analysis  due  to  curative  surgery  was  50  (7.2%)  in  the 
bevacizumab arms and 32 (4.6%) in the placebo arms. When patients with curative surgery were not 
censored  the  results  were  similar  to  those  of  the  primary  PFS  analysis.  In  the  overall  comparison, 
chemotherapy+BV  was  significantly  superior  to  chemotherapy  alone  (ITT:  HR=0.83,  97.5%  CI  = 
[0.72; 0.95], p=0.0015). Similarly, XELOX+BV was significantly superior to XELOX+P (HR=0.76, 
97.5% CI = [0.63; 0.93], p=0.0015), whereas statistical superiority of treatment with FOLFOX-4+BV 
over treatment with FOLFOX-4+P was not reached (HR=0.89, 97.5% CI = [0.74; 1.08], p=0.1851).  
Overall survival  
In the overall comparison in the ITT population according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate, the overall 
median OS was approximately 18 months (574 days for patients in the chemotherapy + placebo arm 
versus  551  days  for  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  +  BV  arm).  At  18  months,  40  patients  and  53 
patients  in  the  placebo-containing  arm  and  in  the  BV-containing  arm,  respectively,  were  still  at  risk 
(width  of  the  97.5%  CI  =  0.111  and  0.128,  respectively).  Thus,  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  at  the 
median OS were considered as not reliable enough.  
Mature  overall  survival  (OS)  data  from  part  II  of  NO16966  (62.5%  patients  have  died)  are  now 
available after an analysis performed with an additional 12 months of follow-up (34% of patients had 
died at the cut-off for the primary analysis). 
The result shows a trend for longer OS with BV compared with placebo (median 92.3 weeks vs. 86.6 
weeks, HR=0.89) however statistical significance was not reached (p=0.0769). Two key factors may 
have reduced the magnitude of OS benefit observed: 
o  Early discontinuation of BV therapy 
o  The  impact  of  a  cohort  with  an  outlying  efficacy  result:  patients  with  previous  adjuvant 
treatment  in  the  FOLFOX+P  arm  had  a  more  favourable  baseline  characteristic  (longer 
time from start of adjuvant therapy to randomisation) than the cohorts of adjuvant-treated 
patients in the other treatment arms. This may explain the unexpectedly good outcome in 
the  FOLFOX-4+P  arm.  A  Cox  regression  model  confirmed  that  time  from  start  of 
adjuvant chemotherapy to randomization (recurrence) has an influence on OS. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three exploratory analyses, aimed at reducing the impact of this cohort on OS, show a significant OS 
benefit of BV vs. Placebo in the 2x2 factorial part II of NO16966. Moreover, an exploratory analysis 
of OS including all patients in NO16966 (from part I and II) shows a similar result.  
An overall survival benefit has therefore also been shown in this study.

Additional  anti-cancer  treatments  after  discontinuing  study  treatment  and  after  disease  progression 
were  administered  to  46%  to  54%  of  the  patients  across  all  treatments  arms.  More  patients  in  the 
placebo-containing arms received second-line chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab-containing 
arms.  The  most  common  therapy  given  as  second-line  treatment  was  irinotecan,  the  second  most 
frequent agent was 5-FU. Second-line treatment was generally equally distributed across the treatment 
arms and will probably not confound the OS data. 
Time to Response 
The  majority  of  responses  (approximately  70%)  occurred  between  week  6  and  week  18  in  both  the 
placebo-containing and the BV-containing groups  
There  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  time  to  response  between  treatment  arms.  This,  lends 
support to the concept that bevacizumab does not produce tumour shrinkage by itself, but rather delays 
progression. Hence, these data are of no concern regarding the efficacy of bevacizumab. 
Duration of Response 
Overall, duration of response was longer for patients who received bevacizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy compared with patients who received chemotherapy. However, for the FOLFOX-4 and 
XELOX subgroups the prolongation in duration of response was not statistically significant (median 
difference 21 days, p=0.24 and 49 days, p=0.057, respectively).  
Time to Treatment Failure 
The  results  of  the  time  to  treatment  failure  (TTF)  analyses  for  superiority  (performed  on  the  safety 
population  (N=1369,  excluding  32  patients  who  did  not  receive  study  medication)  are  in  support  of 
those achieved for the primary endpoint PFS.  
Statistical  superiority  was  observed  using  the  general  approach  for  chemotherapy + BV  over 
chemotherapy  alone  in  the  overall  comparison  (HR=0.84;  97.5%  CI,  0.74-0.96)  and  in  the  XELOX 
treatment  subgroup  (HR=0.80;  97.5%  CI,  0.67-0.97).  A  trend  for  a  longer  time  to  treatment  failure 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was observed for FOLFOX-4+BV over FOLFOX-4 alone (HR=0.88; 97.5% CI, 0.73-1.06; p=0.1274). 
Similar results were observed using the on-treatment approach. 
These analyses support the conclusions of the analyses of the primary endpoint. 
Supportive analyses 
Subgroup Analyses 
A  number  of  Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  to  investigate  the  internal  consistency  of  the  study 
and  the  robustness  of  the  findings  for  the  efficacy  endpoints.  Data  are  only  presented  for  PFS  and 
BOR as OS data are not yet mature for the analyses of superiority of chemotherapy+bevacizumab vs. 
chemotherapy+placebo. 
Among other analyses three categories of subgroups were used for the superiority comparisons. The 
three categories of subgroups and their components are listed below: 
• Demographic and baseline characteristics: Gender (male, female), Age (<65 years, ≥65 years), Use 
of adjuvant therapy (yes, no). Race (White, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian, Other) 
•  Stratification  variables  used  for  randomisation:  ECOG  performance  status  (0,  1),  Number  of 
metastatic  sites  (organs)  at  baseline  (1,  >1),  Alkaline  phosphatase  level  at  baseline  (within  normal 
range, above normal range) 
Liver as a site of metastasis (yes, no)  
• Geographic region 
In  the  overall  comparison  with  respect  to  PFS  based  on  the  ITT,  14  of  16  subgroups  defined  by 
demographic and baseline characteristics and stratification variables used for randomisation had point 
estimates  for  HR  below  1.  The  two  exceptions  were:  receiving  adjuvant  chemotherapy  before 
randomisation (HR=1.12, 97.5% CI = 0.84; 1.50) and not having liver as a metastatic site (HR=1.03, 
97.5% CI = 0.77; 1.38). Three geographic regions: USA (HR=1.06, 97.5% CI = [0.64; 1.74]), British 
Isles (HR=1.26, 97.5% CI = [0.83; 1.91]), and Oceania (HR=1.19, 97.5% CI = [0.70; 2.02]), had point 
estimates for HR above 1, but not statistically different. 
Although variability was observed, the results from the subgroup analyses support the primary finding 
of superiority of XELOX+BV/FOLFOX-4+BV over XELOX+P/FOLFOX-4+P.  
In  the  FOLFOX-4  treatment  subgroup  comparison  with  respect  to  PFS  based  on  the  ITT,  12  of  16 
subgroups examined in demographic and baseline characteristics and stratification variables used for 
randomisation  had  point  estimates  for  HR  below  1.  The  exceptions  were:  age  ≥65  years  (HR=1.08, 
97.5% CI = [0.77; 1.51]), receiving adjuvant chemotherapy before randomisation (HR=1.75, 97.5% CI 
= [1.15; 2.65]), more than 1 metastatic site at baseline (HR=1.03, 97.5% CI = [0.81; 1.33]), and not 
having liver as a metastatic site (HR=1.47, 97.5% CI = [0.98; 2.21]). For these subgroups, the results 
in  the  FOLFOX-4  and  XELOX  treatment  groups  went  in  opposite  directions.  There  was  a  high 
variability across geographic regions. 
As mentioned above, in patients with prior adjuvant chemotherapy addition of bevacizumab reduced 
the PFS compared to patients without (HR=1.75, 97.5% CI [1.15; 2.65]). This was true only for the 
comparison between the FOLFOX-4 arms. In contrast, in the XELOX groups the HR of 0.75 indicates 
a benefit of BV in patients with prior adjuvant chemotherapy, see Figure below.

The HR of 0.75 in favour of BV in the XELOX subgroup of patients with prior adjuvant treatment is 
similar to that in patients without prior adjuvant treatment in both the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 groups. 
This  further  emphasizes  that  the  result  in  adjuvant-treated  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4  groups  is  an 
outlier, see Table below.

Additional  exploratory  analyses  showed  that  the  time  from  start  of  adjuvant  treatment  to 
randomization was associated with outcome in the NO16966 study. A longer time from start adjuvant 
therapy  to  randomization  in  NO16966 could  partially explain  the  better  outcome  in  adjuvant-treated 
patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4+P  arm.  This  patient  cohort  had  the  highest  proportion  of  patients  with  a 
long  time  (>4  years)  and  the  lowest  proportion  with  a  short  time  (<1  year)  from  start  of  adjuvant 
therapy  to  randomization  compared  with  the  cohorts  of  adjuvant-treated  patients  in  the  other  arms. 
This baseline imbalance in a significant prognostic factor likely explains the outlying HR of 1.75 in 
the subgroup of patients with prior adjuvant therapy in the FOLFOX-4 treatment arms. 
In addition, patients without liver metastases did not benefit from bevacizumab compared to patients 
with  liver  metastasis  (HR=1.47,  97.5%  CI  [0.98;  2.21).  However,  the  favourable  prognostic 
characteristic (i.e., longer time from start of adjuvant therapy to randomisation) of the adjuvant-treated 
subgroup  of  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4+P  arm  is  also  driving  the  result  in  the  subgroup  of  patients 
with no liver metastases at baseline, based on the following observations 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
In  the  overall  comparison  including  all  patients,  the  HR  is  1.03  for  patients  with  no  liver 
metastases at baseline. In the subgroups, the HR in patients with no liver metastases is 1.47 in 
the FOLFOX-4 treatment groups but 0.72 in XELOX group. Thus, the FOLFOX-4 subgroup 
is confounding the overall result while there is a clear benefit for patients treated with BV in 
the XELOX group, see Table below.

•  The subgroup of patients with no liver metastases is partially overlapping with the subgroup of 
adjuvant patients (i.e., the subgroup in which there is an imbalance in a significant prognostic 
factor favouring the placebo arm):  54% (178/332) of the group with no liver metastases were 
treated  in  the  adjuvant  setting  (compares  with  24%  [340/1400]  of  the  ITT  population)  – 
therefore  the  influence  of  the  prior  adjuvant  patients  is  greater  in  this  subgroup  than  in  the 
overall population. 
•  A  comparison  of  the  HR  for  PFS  in  the  subgroup  with  no  liver  metastases  at  baseline  in 
patients  with  and  without  previous  adjuvant  treatment  indicates  that  the  outlying  result  is 
driven by the former patient group, see Table below. 
•  Exclusion of a) all adjuvant-treated patients b) adjuvant-treated patients only in the FOLFOX-
P  arm  resulted  in  a  similar  HR  of  0.89  and  0.88  in  favour  of  treatment  with  BV  in  patients 
with no liver metastases, see Table below.

In conclusion, patients without liver metastases at baseline generally benefit from treatment with BV. 
The  subgroup  of  adjuvant  treated  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4+P  group,  who  had  a  more  favourable 
prognostic  characteristic  (longer  time  to  recurrence  after  adjuvant  therapy)  compared  with  the 
FOLFOX-4+BV arm, confound the result observed for the overall comparison. 
Exploratory analyses (not pre-specified): Prognostic factor analyses of the influence of prior adjuvant 
chemotherapy:  
In  the  subgroup  analysis  result  there  was  a  clear  distinction  between  patients  who  received  prior 
adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not. Additional exploratory analyses were performed in an 
effort to better understand the PFS outcome in the FOLFOX-4+P treatment arm . 
Approximately  25%  of  the  patients  in  each  of  the  six  treatment  groups  received  adjuvant 
chemotherapy  prior  to  randomisation,  including  85  (24%)  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4+P  arm.  These 
results  indicate  that  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4+P  arm  had  the  longest  time  from  start  and  end  of 
adjuvant treatment to randomisation and also the longest time from first diagnosis of colorectal cancer 
to randomisation. These differences suggest that patients with previous adjuvant treatment who were 
randomised  into  the  FOLFOX-4+P  group  may  have  had  slower  tumour  progression  compared  with 
patients  with  previous  adjuvant 
into  FOLFOX+BV,  XELOX+P  and 
XELOX+BV arms. 
treatment  randomised

An  exploratory  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  excluding  patients  who  received  prior  adjuvant 
chemotherapy  from  all  treatment  arms,  XELOX,  XELOX+P,  XELOX+BV,  FOLFOX-4,  FOLFOX-
4+P, FOLFOX-4+BV.  
Another  exploratory  analysis  was  performed  where  patients  with  prior  adjuvant  treatment  were 
excluded from the FOLFOX+P treatment group only.  
These analyses show that removing the subgroup of patients that may have slower tumour progression, 
improves the results, and even the subgroup analysis of FOLFOX-4 becomes significant in favour of 
addition of bevacizumab. This is a post-hoc analysis which must be viewed with caution.  
Study E3200 
Study E3200 was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled Phase III trial to evaluate 
the  safety  and  efficacy  of  FOLFOX-4  +  10  mg/kg/q2w  bevacizumab  versus  FOLFOX-4  versus  10 
mg/kg/q2w bevacizumab alone in previously treated patients with advanced CRC.  
The  study  was  conducted  in  the  USA  by  the  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  in 
collaboration with a number of other cooperative groups. Initially, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to one of three treatment arms: FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab, FOLFOX-4, or bevacizumab alone 
(referred to as Arms A, B, and C, respectively, in the E3200 protocol).

The primary objectives was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab when combined with 
FOLFOX-4  versus  FOLFOX-4  alone  in  patients  with  advanced  CRC  who  have  failed  therapy  with 
irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil, as measured by duration of survival. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab when combined with FOLFOX-
4  versus  FOLFOX-4  alone  in  patients  with  advanced  CRC  who  have  failed  therapy  with  irinotecan 
and  5-fluorouracil,  as  measured  by  progression-free  survival,  objective  response,  and  duration  of 
objective responses.  
Exploratory objectives included comparisons of all efficacy and safety endpoints between each of the 
remaining  pairs  of  treatment  arms  (FOLFOX-4  +  bevacizumab  vs.  bevacizumab  monotherapy,  and 
FOLFOX-4 vs. bevacizumab monotherapy).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was: Duration of survival (DS), defined as the time from randomisation 
to death from any cause. All reported deaths were included in the analysis.  
The Secondary efficacy endpoints were: Progression free survival (PFS), Objective response (ORR), 
defined  as  a  complete  or  partial  best  confirmed  response  (CR  or  PR)  and  Duration  of  objective 
response (DR) was determined for the subset of patients who achieved an objective response.  
Treatment assignment was open-label. Tumour response and disease progression were assessed by the 
ECOG  Coordinating  Centre  based  on  a  review  of  tumour  assessments  provided  by  the  investigator. 
Tumour evaluations were performed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST). Pre-study scans and X-rays were performed within 6 weeks prior to Randomisation. Pre-
study  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  and  chemistries  were  performed  within  4  weeks  prior  to 
Randomisation.  While  on  protocol  therapy,  tumour  assessments  were  performed  every  8  weeks. 
Patients who discontinued protocol therapy prior to progression continued to be evaluated for tumour 
response  until  disease  progression.  Patients  who  discontinued  protocol  therapy  were  followed  for 
survival  status  until  death.  The  schedule  for  follow-up  was  every  3  months  (if  the  patient  was  <  2 
years from study entry), every 6 months (if the patient was 2–5 years from study entry), or every 12 
months (if the patient was > 5 years from study entry).  
Study Participants & Inclusion/Exclusion Criterias  
Study  E3200  was  a  multicenter  study  conducted  at  220 investigative  sites  in  the  United  States.  The 
protocol  called  for  the  enrolment  of  approximately  880  patients  across  the  three  treatment  arms 
(approximately  293  per  treatment  arm).  Total  of  829  patients  were  randomised  to  the  study;  292 
patients to FOLFOX-4, 293 patients to FOLFOX-4+BV, and 244 patients to BV monotherapy.

The  target  population  for  Study  E3200  was  patients  with  mCRC  who  had  previously  received 
treatment  with  a  fluoropyrimidine-based  and  an  irinotecan-based  regimen,  either  alone  or  in 
combination, for advanced disease. The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were well-
balanced across groups. The patient characteristics were broadly similar to those of patients recruited 
into Study NO16966, excepting that patients were more heavily pretreated (in both adjuvant [~80%] 
and metastatic settings [~97% of the 664 patients with ECOG eligibility checklist available]). A total 
of

FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab,  and  244  patients  to  bevacizumab  monotherapy  prior  to  this  arm  being 
discontinued).  At  the  time  of  the  final  analysis,  among  the  585  patients  randomized  to  the  two 
principal arms, 525 (90%) deaths had occurred.

In  the  E3200  study  there  were  fewer  withdrawals  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  than  there  were  in 
NO16966.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  E3200  was  an  open-label  study,  which  may  well  have 
made  the  patients  more  motivated  to  carry  on  treatment  including  the  new  drug  despite  some  side 
effects.  In  this  respect  the  two  pivotal  studies  are  not  quite  comparable.  However,  it  would  seem 
possible that a longer duration of treatment in the bevacizumab arms of the NO16966 trial might have 
improved results in that trial further.  
Baseline data 
The mean age of the patients was 60.4 years (range: 21 to 85 years). Sixty percent of all patients were 
male, and the majority of patients were white (87%). Overall, 49% of patients had a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 0. The median baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value was 62 ng/mL. 
Approximately 80% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and 26% received radiotherapy prior 
to study entry. Out of the patients who received prior cancer therapy for advanced disease, only few 
(approximately 3%) had irinotecan based therapy in the adjuvant or first-line setting. 
The median number of involved metastatic sites was 2 and the sites of organ involvement were similar 
across  treatment  arms.  However,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  more  than  one  organ  site  with 
metastatic  disease  was  higher  in  the  BV  monotherapy  arm  than  in  the  FOLFOX-4  and  FOLFOX-
4 + BV arms. Overall, metastatic sites most frequently involved were liver (73.5%), lung (55.4%), and 
other abdominal (23.2%). 
Treatments 
In  study  E3200  the  bevacizumab  dose  in  the  second-line  study  was  10 mg/kg  every  2  weeks,  i.e., 
5 mg/kg/week  equivalent.  Although  Phase  II  data  (Study AVF0780g)  had  suggested  that  both  the 
5 mg/kg  and  10 mg/kg  doses  every  2  weeks  were  tolerable  and  active,  a  clear  dose-response 
relationship was not established. At the time ECOG initiated the E3200 study, results from AVF2107g 
demonstrating a clear positive benefit risk ratio for the 2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent dose were not yet 
available.  In  the  absence  of  a  clear  dose  response  relationship  from  Phase  II,  or  demonstration  of  a 
dose  providing  positive  risk  benefit  ratio  from  Phase  III,  ECOG  selected  the  dose  of  5 mg/kg/week 
equivalent  for  the  E3200  trial.  This  decision  was  based  on  the  desire  to  increase  the  likelihood  of 
selecting  a  beneficial  dose  in  this  more  advanced  and  refractory  population  and  was  consistent  with 
the  general  principle  in  oncology  of  using  the  highest  tolerable  dose  to  reach  maximum  efficacy. 
Therefore,  the  data  from  the  dose  of  10 mg/kg  every  2  weeks  (5  mg/kg/week  equivalent)  have  
established a positive risk benefit ratio, based on an acceptable safety profile and an overall survival 
benefit for bevacizumab, in second-line treatment. The efficacy of the lower dose in the second-line 
setting has not been tested. 
As previously mentioned no dose finding study has been performed which is not ideal, but considered 
acceptable to have two different dose levels.  
Dosing interval 
The dose of 2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent was used in the NO16966 study. As in previous phase II and 
III  studies 
to  concomitant 
chemotherapies. This dosing is supported by the fact that BV has a slow clearance and a long terminal 
half-life  of  approximately  20 days  as  with  other  IgG  antibodies.  In  addition,  data  generated  in  a  PK 
simulation  of  BV  administration  showed  that  BV  exposure  is  similar  when  using  the  same  weekly 
the  dosing  frequency  of  BV  administration  was  synchronized 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
dose intensity in a 2-weekly and a 3-weekly dosing regimen. Accordingly, a dose of 7.5 mg/kg every 3 
weeks was used with XELOX and a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks was used with FOLFOX-4.   
•  RESULTS – study E3200  
Participant flow 
Overall, 806 patients (97.2%) received  protocol therapy. Protocol therapy was not considered ended 
until  the  last  component  of  any  study  treatment  was  stopped.  A  total  of  805  patients  (97.1%)  have 
ended  protocol  therapy:  285  (97.6%)  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm,  287  (98.0%)  in  the  FOLFOX-4+ 
bevacizumab arm, and 233 (95.5%) in the bevacizumab  monotherapy arm. One patient indicated on 
the case report form (CRF) as continuing protocol therapy had died. Therefore, no patients remained 
on protocol therapy. 
 The most common reason that protocol therapy ended (withdrawal from study treatment) was disease 
progression  or  relapse  during  active  treatment:  147  patients  (50.3%)  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm,  141 
(48.1%) in the FOLFOX-4+bevacizumab arm, and 159 (65.2%) in the bevacizumab monotherapy arm. 
Approximately a fifth of all randomised patients withdrew due to safety reasons (69 patients (23.6%) 
in the FOLFOX-4 arm, 66 patients (22.5%) in the FOLFOX-4+BV arm, and 28 patients (11.5%) in the 
BV monotherapy arm).  
Recruitment 
Between 13 November 2001 and 28 April 2003, 829 patients with advanced CRC were randomised to 
one of the three treatment arms; 292 patients to FOLFOX-4, 293 patients to FOLFOX-4+BV, and 244 
patients to BV monotherapy. Enrolment into the BV monotherapy arm was closed 11 Match 2003.  
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended eight times after November 2001 when the first patients began treatment. 
The amendments to the study protocol are not considered to influence the result of the analysis of OS.   
Protocol deviations 
A  total  of  9  patients  (1.1%)  were  assessed  as  ineligible  for  the  study  by  ECOG.  The  most  common 
explanation  provided  for  ineligibility  based  on  available  comments  was  lack  of  measurable  disease. 
The  protocol  deviations  were  mostly  similarly  distributed  across  the  two  principal  arms  (FOLFOX-
4+bevacizumab arm and FOLFOX-4 arm).  There were no major protocol deviations.  
Primary Endpoint 
Overall survival 
The analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoint consisted of all patients randomised to the 
principal treatment arms (FOLFOX-4+BV and FOLFOX-4). The final analysis was performed using 
the most current and complete efficacy data available (received from Genentech Inc. by ECOG on 1 
August 2005). Among the 585 patients randomised to the two principal arms, 525 deaths had occurred 
at the time of the final analysis: 265 in the FOLFOX-4 arm and 260 in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm.

Overall  survival  was  statistically  significantly  longer  for  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4+BV  arm 
(13.0 months) compared with patients in the FOLFOX-4 arm (10.8 months). The stratified hazard ratio 
for death for FOLFOX-4+BV relative to FOLFOX-4 was 0.751 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.89). There were 13.1

Progression-free survival 
A  total  of  356  patients  in  the  principal  arms  had  died  or  experienced  disease  progression  during 
protocol therapy at the time of the final analysis, 179 patients in the FOLFOX-4 arm and 177 patients 
in  the  FOLFOX-4+BV  arm  (Table  7  and  Figure  3).  The  difference  in  median  PFS  was  3 months  in 
favour of the FOLFOX-4+BV group, which was statistically significant (p < 0.0001).

(Source: Module 5(15))  
Objective response rate 
Among  all  randomised  patients  in  the  principal  arm,  the  objective  response  rate  was  significantly 
higher  (p < 0.0001)  in  the  FOLFOX-4+BV  arm  (22.2%)  than  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (8.6%).  The 
majority of responses were partial responses (FOLFOX-4+BV (20.5%) and FOLFOX-4 (7.9%)).  
Duration of response  
For patients with an objective response, the median duration of objective response in the FOLFOX-4 
arm was 6.0 months and ranged from 1.8 to 8.3 months. Median duration of objective response in the 
FOLFOX-4+bevacizumab  arm  was  6.2  months  and  ranged  from  0  to  13.7  months.  Because  the 
determination  of  duration  of  objective  response  was  based  on  a  non-randomised  subset  of  patients, 
formal hypothesis testing was not performed. However, treatment arms were compared for descriptive 
purposes (HR = 0.650; log-rank p = 0.2014, unstratified analysis). 
Supportive analyses 
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint duration of survival were performed according to 
the following parameters:  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
•  ECOG performance status at study entry (0, ≥ 1)  
•  Prior radiotherapy (yes, no)  
•  Age (< 40, 40–64, ≥ 65 years)  
•  Gender, race (white, non-white)  
•  Number of involved sites (1, > 1)  
•  Baseline CEA value (≤ ULN, > ULN)  
•  Baseline sum of longest diameters of all target lesions (< median, ≥ median). 
The results of these subgroup analyses were consistent with those for the randomised population as a 
whole.  Overall,  there  was  a  trend  for  prolonged  duration  of  survival  for  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-
4+BV arm compared with those in the FOLFOX-4 arm regardless of the baseline risk factor examined. 
For patients with baseline CEA values below ULN, the hazard ratio was 1.11. Most likely, this is due 
to  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  this  subgroup  which  is  also  reflected  in  the  wide 
confidence interval.  
Treatment effect with adjustment for risk factors 
Hazards  regression  was  applied  to  estimate  the  effect  of  bevacizumab  after  adjusting  for  important 
prognostic  factors  for  overall  survival.  The  adjusted  hazard  ratio  indicate  an  approximately  31% 
reduction in the hazard of death among patients who received FOLFOX-4+BV treatment compared to 
those who received FOLFOX-4, and thus support the primary analysis.  
Exploratory analyses 
Sensitivity analysis of duration of survival 
At the FDA’s request, a sensitivity analysis was performed for duration of survival for the principal 
treatment arms, in which patients who were lost to follow-up for survival were analyzed as events as 
of the date of last contact, rather than as censored observations. The sensitivity analyses support the 
result of the primary analysis.  
Bevacizumab monotherapy arm 
Exploratory  analyses  of  duration  of  survival,  PFS,  and  objective  response  were  performed  for  the 
bevacizumab  monotherapy  arm.  The  objective  response  rate  in  the  bevacizumab  monotherapy  arm 
was 3.3%. All objective responses were partial responses. 
In the BV monotherapy arm OS was not significantly different from the FOLFOX-4 arm (p=0.7631), 
while PFS was 2 months shorter (p<0.0001) in the BV arm. Additionally, the ORR was significantly 
lower (p=0.0121) in the BV monotherapy treatment arm.  
As  patients  stopped  therapy  in  the  BV  monotherapy  arm,  it  is  likely  that  they  received  standard 
oxaliplatin and/ or irinotecan-based regimens. This  may have led to a similar  overall survival in the 
BV  monotherapy  arm  to  that  in  the  FOLFOX-4  alone  arm.  However,  since  information  on  the 
therapies received after progression was not collected in this study, it is not possible to confirm this. 
Symptomatic deterioration 
Symptomatic deterioration was assessed by the investigator for treated patients on the ECOG Follow-
Up Disease Evaluation Form. Overall, the symptomatic deterioration was equally distributed across 
the treatment arms. However, there were significantly more patients who experienced symptomatic 
deterioration without disease progression in the FOLFOX-4+BV arm compared to the other treatment 
arms, with the lowest incidence in the BV monotherapy arm. This may be due to FOLFOX-4 related 
toxicity.  
Duration  of  survival:  Comparison  of  the  FOLFOX-4+BV  arm  with  the  FOLFOX-4  and 
bevacizumab monotherapy arms 
At the request of the FDA, an exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate whether the FOLFOX-
4+ BV arm was superior to both the FOLFOX-4 and bevacizumab monotherapy arms as measured by 
duration of survival. Not surprisingly, the results of the Bayesian analysis were in line with the results 
of the primary analysis and indicated that it is highly likely that FOLFOX-4+bevacizumab is superior 
both to FOLFOX-4 and to bevacizumab monotherapy as measured by duration of survival.

2. 4.  Clinical Safety  
Introduction: 
The two clinical trials (NO16966 and E3200), together with a number of published studies (Table 2) 
yield  a  total  of  approximately  5800  patients  exposed  to  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  various 
fluoropyrimidine-based therapies in different lines of treatment. Of these patients approximately 5000 
have been treated with an oxaliplatin-based regimen.

The  differences  between  the  two  key  studies  in  this  submission  (NO16966  and  E3200)  in  overall 
design  and,  in  particular,  the  safety  reporting  requirements,  do  not  support  meaningful  pooling  or 
quantitative  comparisons  of  the  safety  profile  across  studies.  Rather  a  qualitative  comparison  of  the 
safety profiles can be made. However, the number of patients treated and included in safety evaluation 
is  large,  yielding  robust  data  on  safety  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy regimens in mCRC. The data from the E3200 trial conform to the usual principles of 
registration of side effects in ECOG, and although this differs from the usual European standards, it is 
of no concern for the present evaluation, because no bias is introduced and because the data material is 
so large.

2. 4. 1.  Exposure 
Study NO16966 
A total of 353 patients in the XELOX + BV arm and 341 in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm were exposed 
to  BV.  In  the  primary  treatment  phase,  the  median  duration  of  treatment  with  BV  vs  placebo  was 
similar  in  the  XELOX  and  FOLFOX-4  arms  (182  vs  168  days  and  184  days  vs  192  days, 
respectively). The median duration of treatment with chemotherapy was also similar in the BV arms 
and  their  placebo  counterparts.  10  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + P  arm  and  6  patients  in  the 
XELOX + P arm received BV at some time during the study and were, therefore, analyzed for safety 
in the respective BV arms. 
Overall,  patients  received  triple  therapy  for  their  entire  treatment  duration  in  the  primary  treatment 
phase:  a  median  of  8  cycles  (24  weeks)  in  the  XELOX + BV  arm,  7 cycles  (21  weeks)  in  the 
XELOX + P  arm,  and  11  cycles  (22  weeks)  in  each  of  the  FOLFOX-4  arms.  There  were  a  higher 
number of patients in the BV arms that received chemotherapy alone for some cycles compared with 
the placebo arms (69 vs 35 patients, respectively). These numbers include patients who interrupted BV 
for one or more cycles and re-started again, or who discontinued BV permanently.  
Median  cumulative  doses  of  BV  were  similar  in  the  XELOX + BV  and  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arms 
(4231.0  and  4320.0 mg,  respectively)  and  similar  to  placebo  (3862.5  and  4118.0 mg,  respectively). 
The median cumulative doses of the FOLFOX-4 treatment components (5-FU bolus, 5-FU infusion, 
leucovorin,  and  oxaliplatin)  and  the  XELOX  treatment  components  (capecitabine  and  oxaliplatin) 
were slightly higher in the BV arms compared with their corresponding placebo arms.  
Overall, in study NO16966 the median duration of chemotherapy treatment was similar between the 
BV arms and their corresponding placebo arms (approx. 6 months), despite the fact that the protocol 
allowed continuation of the study therapy until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  
Study E3200 
A total of 285 patients in the FOLFOX-4 arm and 287 patients in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm received 
treatment,  defined  as  at  least  one  component  of  protocol  therapy.  As  per  NCI-CTC  AE  reporting 
standards,  data  were  not  collected  for  exposure  to  individual  components  of  protocol  therapy.  The 
number  of  cycles  of  protocol  therapy  received  was  higher  for  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm 
(median  of  10  cycles)  than  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (median  of  7  cycles).  The  duration  of  exposure, 
defined as time from initiation of protocol therapy until termination of protocol therapy, was longer in 
the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm (median 160 days) than in the FOLFOX-4 arm (median of 105 days)  
It  is  noted  that  the  exposure  to  treatment  was  as  long  as  or  longer  in  the  bevacizumab  arms  of  the 
protocols  compared  to  the  control  arms.  There  is,  therefore,  no  problem  with  the  exposure  to 
bevacizumab containing regimens in the analyses of toxicity. 
2. 4. 2.  Adverse Events  
Study NO16966 
Analysis  of  AEs  is  based  primarily  on  the  comparison  of  the  pooled  chemotherapy + BV  arms 
(XELOX + BV  and  FOLFOX-4 + BV)  vs  the  chemotherapy + P  arms  (XELOX + P  and  FOLFOX-
4 + P) The following key results were observed with the addition of BV to chemotherapy:  
•  The overall incidence of grade 3/4 AEs was higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms than in the 
chemotherapy + P arms (80.0% vs 74.8%, respectively). 
AEs  of  special  interest  for  chemotherapy,  as  predefined  in  the  protocol,  were  seen  in  a  similar 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  and  chemotherapy + P  arms,  with  the  following 
exceptions: 
1. 
The incidence of PPE was increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms (grade 3: 7.1% vs 3.4%), 
predominantly in the XELOX arms only.   
The  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  was  increased  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms 
(grade  3/4:  32.4%  vs  27.1%),  due  to  higher  incidences  in  a  number  of  different  events  (eg, 
diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and stomatitis) in the BV groups.  
The 
incidence  of  all  grade  and  grade  3/4  cardiac  AEs  (including  cardiac  arterial 
thromboembolic  AEs)  was  increased  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  compared  with  the 
2.

5. 
6. 
chemotherapy + P arms (all grades: 7.8% vs 5.2%; grade 3/4: 3.5% vs 0.4%, respectively). The 
increase was seen in both treatment subgroups (FOLFOX-4: 2.9% vs 0.3%; XELOX: 4.0% vs 
0.6%, respectively).  
The incidences of AEs of special interest defined for BV were the following: 
a. 
Bleeding  (all  grades)  events  were  increased  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  vs 
chemotherapy + P (30.5% vs 25.9%); the majority of events were grade 1/2. 
Thromboembolic  events  were 
chemotherapy + P, respectively: 
the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  vs 
increased 
in 
b. 
1.  Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events: 12 patients (1.7%) vs 7 (1.0%). 
2.  Grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events: 54 patients (7.8%) vs 33 (4.9%). 
c.   Hypertension  was  increased  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  vs  chemotherapy + P  (all 
d. 
grade: 18.9% vs 6.4%, grade 3/4: 3.7% vs 1.2%, respectively). 
Grade  3/4  gastrointestinal  perforations,  proteinuria,  and  wound  healing  complications 
were all uncommon. 
A higher proportion of patients discontinued all study treatment due to AEs in the BV treatment 
arms (approximately 31% vs 21%) mainly due to chemotherapy-related toxicity; however, 21% 
of  the  patients  in  the  BV  treatment  arms  versus  15%  in  the  placebo  arms  discontinued  all 
therapy due to grade 3/4 AEs, showing that discontinuations due to AEs that were not severe or 
life-threatening were not uncommon. Only 5% of the patients in the BV treatment arms and 2% 
in the placebo arms discontinued all study treatment due to AEs of special interest for BV. 
Thirty  (4.3%)  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  and  15  (2.2%)  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy + P arm died due to causes other than progressive disease (PD) (deaths up to 28 
days  after  last  drug  administration.  The  incidence  of  treatment-related  deaths  (up  to  28  days 
after last drug administration) was 2.0% (14 patients) in the chemotherapy + BV arms and 1.5% 
(10 patients) in the chemotherapy + P arms; the 60-day mortality rate was 2.0% (14 patients) in 
the chemotherapy + BV arms and 1.6% (11 patients) in the chemotherapy + P arms. 
Common Adverse Events 
•  All Grade Adverse Events 
Nearly all patients in each treatment group (99% to 100%) experienced at least one AE. The overall 
incidence  of  the  most  commonly  occurring  AEs  was  similar  between  the  BV  arms  and  the 
corresponding  placebo  arms.  Increases  in  the  incidence (≥ 5% in absolute difference)  of  common 
AEs with the addition of BV to each treatment regimen included the following: 
Increases in the chemotherapy + BV arms vs chemotherapy + P, respectively: 
•  Anorexia: 30% vs 25% (the increase was more marked in XELOX + BV arm)  
•  Epistaxis: 21% vs 13% (with an overall higher incidence in FOLFOX-4 arms)  
•  Hypertension: 16% vs 6% 
Increases in the XELOX + BV arm vs the XELOX + P arm, respectively: 
•  Vomiting: 47% vs 41% 
•  PPE: 39% vs 30% 
•  Stomatitis: 29% vs 22% 
Increases in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm vs the FOLFOX-4 + P arm, respectively:  
•  Chest pain: 9% vs 4%, 
•  Dysphonia: 8% vs 1% 
The following AEs had a lower incidence in the chemotherapy + BV arms vs chemotherapy + P, 
respectively: 
•  Neutropenia: 37% vs 43% 
•  Thrombocytopenia: 13% vs 21%  
Grade 3/4 Adverse Events 
Grade  3/4  AEs  were  reported  in  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms 
compared  with  the  chemotherapy + P  arms  (80%  vs  75%).  Similar  results  were  seen  in  the  4-arm 
comparison (76% vs 70% in the XELOX + BV and XELOX + P arms, respectively, and 84% vs 80% 
in the FOLFOX-4 + BV and FOLFOX-4 + P arms, respectively. The incidence of the following grade 
3/4 AEs was higher in the BV arms compared with their corresponding placebo arms: 
24 
 
 
 
In the chemotherapy + BV arms vs chemotherapy + P arms, respectively  
•  Gastrointestinal disorders: 32% vs 27%, including diarrhea (17% vs 15%) and vomiting (6% 
vs 4%) 
•  Vascular  disorders:  10%  vs  5%,  including  hypertension  (3%  [23  patients]  vs  < 1% 
[6 patients]) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT, 3% [19 patients] vs 1% [10 patients]) 
•  Cardiac disorders: 3% (24 patients) vs < 1% (3 patients), the events in the BV arms including 
a mixture etiologies, ie, ischemic events, arrhythmias and heart failure. 
•  Pulmonary embolism: 3% (18 patients) vs < 1% (6 patients) 
In the XELOX + BV arm vs the XELOX + P arm, respectively: 
•  PPE: 12% vs 6% 
Neutropenia  was  the  most  frequently  reported  grade  3/4  AE  and  had  a  lower  incidence  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV  arms  compared  with  the  chemotherapy + P  arms  (23%  vs  26%,  respectively). 
Most of these adverse events were expected to be somewhat more common in the bevacizumab arms, 
based on the known toxicity profile of bevacizumab.  
Deaths 
All Deaths 
The  overall  proportion  of  patients  who  died  during  the  whole  study  was  lower  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV  arms  (32%)  than  in  the  chemotherapy + P  arms  (36%).  The  majority  of  deaths 
were  directly  attributed  to  PD.  With  respect  to  the  non-PD  related  deaths,  causes  were  generally  of 
similar nature between arms. However, more deaths in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared with 
the chemotherapy + P arms were reported in the cardiac system organ class (1.4%, 10/694 patients vs 
0.3%,  2/675  patients,  respectively),  and  due  to  gastrointestinal  obstruction  (0.6%,  4/694  patients  vs 
none, respectively). AEs of special interest for BV with fatal outcome were rare and occurred with a 
similar  incidence  in  each  group:  gastrointestinal  perforation,  hemorrhage,  (single  patients  in  each 
group) and thromboembolic events (4 patients in each group). Other causes of death such as infection 
and gastrointestinal toxicity occurred with similar incidence in both treatment groups. 
The  pattern  in  overall  causes  of  death  was  similar  between  the  BV  arms  and  their  corresponding 
placebo arms in the 4-arm comparison, with the exception of: gastrointestinal obstruction and cardiac 
deaths. Four cases of gastrointestinal obstruction leading to death occurred in the XELOX + BV arm. 
All 4 cases were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment, and PD was considered 
the likely cause in 3 of 4 cases. The fourth case was not clearly associated with PD. More deaths in the 
BV arms were reported in the cardiac system organ class compared with their corresponding placebo 
arms  (7/353  in  XELOX + BV  vs  1/339  in  XELOX + P;  3/341  in  FOLFOX-4 +  BV  vs  1/336  in 
FOLFOX-4 + P).  
Deaths within 60 Days of Treatment Start 
The overall incidence of death cases occurring within 60 days of start of study treatment was the same 
in the chemotherapy + BV arms (2%, 14/694 patients) and in the chemotherapy + P arms (2%, 11/675 
patients).  The  most  frequent  causes  of  these  early  deaths  were  infections  (4  vs  3 patients  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV  and  chemotherapy + P  arms,  respectively)  and  cardiac  deaths  (4  vs  1 patient, 
respectively). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 3 deaths within 60 days of study treatment initiation 
in the chemotherapy + P arms only. 
Of all deaths that occurred in the study due to infection, 7/14 occurred in the first 60 days of treatment 
start,  and  were  evenly  distributed  across  the  4  treatment  arms  (2  in  XELOX + BV,  2  in  FOLFOX-
4 + BV,  3  in  FOLFOX-4 + P,  and  none  in  XELOX + P).  Of  the  cardiac  deaths  in  the  study,  5/12 
occurred  in  the  first  60  days  of  treatment  (3  in  XELOX + BV,  1  in  FOLFOX-4 + BV,  and  1  in 
FOLFOX-4 + P) 
Deaths within 28 Days of Last Dose of Study Medication 
In  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms,  33  patients  (5%)  died  within  28  days  of  their  last  dose  of  study 
medication (ie, at any time between start of treatment and 28 days after last dose) compared with 16 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients (2%) in the chemotherapy + P arms. Four of these deaths (3 in the chemotherapy + BV and 1 
in  the  chemotherapy + P  arms)  were  attributed  to  PD.  Cardiac-related  deaths  (9 patients)  and 
infections  (7  patients)  were 
the 
chemotherapy + BV  arms  while  infections  (5  patients)  were  the  most  frequent  cause  in  the 
chemotherapy + P arms.  
the  most  frequent  causes  of  non-PD  related  deaths 
in 
In the 4-arm  comparison, deaths within 28 days of the last dose  of study medication occurred in 19 
patients (5%, XELOX + BV) and 14 patients (4%, FOLFOX + BV) in the BV arms compared with 9 
patients  (3%,  XELOX + P)  and  7  patients  (2%,  FOLFOX + P)  in  the  placebo  arms.  Of  the  4  deaths 
attributed to PD, 2 were in the XELOX + BV arm, 1 was in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and 1 was in 
the  XELOX +  P  arm.  Most  non-PD  related  causes  of  death  were  seen  in  only  1  or  2  patients  per 
treatment group, with the following exceptions: 
Infections were the cause of death in 4 patients (1%) in both FOLFOX-4 arms and 3 patients (< 1%) in 
the XELOX + BV arm.   
Cardiac deaths occurred in 6 patients (2%) in the XELOX + BV arm and in 3 patients (< 1%) in the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV arm compared with none and 1 in the corresponding placebo arms.   
Respiratory organ system-related deaths occurred in 3 patients (< 1%) in the XELOX + BV arm. 
•  Other Serious Adverse Events 
The  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  was  similar  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  and  chemotherapy + P  arms 
(40% and 37%, respectively). Small increases in incidence were seen in the chemotherapy + BV arms 
vs chemotherapy + P, respectively, in the following system organ classes:  
Gastrointestinal disorders: 17% vs 15% 
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: 6% vs 4% 
Cardiac disorders: 3% vs < 1% 
There were no major differences between treatment arms for the most commonly occurring individual 
SAEs, Table 26, with the exception of pulmonary embolism (17 patients [2%] in the chemotherapy + 
BV arms vs 7 patients [1%] in the chemotherapy + P arms). 
The  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  was  similar  between  the  XELOX + BV  and  XELOX + P  arms  (37% 
and 36%, respectively), but higher in the FOLFOX-4 + BV compared with the FOLFOX-4 + P arms 
(43% vs 38%, respectively).  
Increases  in  incidence  of  SAEs  were  seen  in  the  BV  arms  vs  their  corresponding  placebo  arms, 
respectively, in the following system organ classes: 
•  Cardiac  disorders:  3%  vs  < 1%,  mainly  due  to  the  occurrence  of  more  cardiac  events  in  the 
BV arms 
•  Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: 6% in XELOX + BV vs 4% in XELOX + P; 
5% in FOLFOX-4 + BV vs 3% in FOLFOX-4 + P; the difference in incidence partly due to an 
increased  incidence  of  pulmonary  embolism  in  the  BV  arms  compared  with  their 
corresponding placebo arms 
In the XELOX + BV arm vs the XELOX + P arm, respectively: 
•  Vascular disorders: 5% vs < 1%, mainly due to DVT (2% vs < 1%), as well as, the occurrence 
of more single events 
In the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm vs the FOLFOX-4 + P arm, respectively: 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders: 14% vs 10%, mainly due to vomiting and obstruction of the small 
intestine  (2%  vs  < 1%  for  both  events),  and  the  occurrence  of  more  single  events  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV arm 
•  Other Significant Adverse Events 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Trial Treatment 
The overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of all trial treatment, as recorded on the AE 
page  of  the  CRF,  was  higher  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  (30%,  207/694  patients)  than  in  the 
chemotherapy + P arms (21%, 141/675 patients)  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  types  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  all  study  treatment  were  generally  chemotherapy-
related  AEs.  Nervous  system  disorders  were  the  most  frequent  causes  of  withdrawal  from  all  study 
treatment,  occurring  with  a  similar  incidence  across  treatment  arms  (7%  in  XELOX + BV,  6%  in 
XELOX + P, 7% in FOLFOX-4 + BV, and 8% in FOLFOX-4 + P).  
Increases in the incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with the addition of BV to each 
treatment regimen included the following: 
In the chemotherapy + BV arms vs the chemotherapy + P arms, respectively: 
Gastrointestinal  disorders:  8%  (54/694  patients)  vs  5%  (31/675  patients),  the  difference  attributable 
mainly to the incidence of diarrhea, which was more common in both XELOX arms  
Cardiac  disorders:  2%  (17/694  patients)  vs  < 1%  (2/675 patients),  the  difference  mainly  due  to 
ischemic events and arrhythmias 
In the XELOX + BV arm vs the XELOX + P arm, respectively: 
PPE: 2% (7/353 patients) vs < 1% (2/339 patients) 
Vascular  disorders:  2%  (6/353  patients)  vs  0  –  the  AEs  being  thrombosis  (3  patients)  hypertension, 
hypertensive crisis, and thrombophlebitis (1 patient each) 
Fatigue: 1% (5/353 patients) vs < 1% (1/339 patient) 
In the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm vs the FOLFOX-4 + P arm, respectively  
• 
• 
Infections and infestations: 4% (12/341 patients) vs < 1% (3/336 patients)  
Skin  reactions:  2%  (6/341  patients  –  including  allergic  reactions  in  3  patients  and  PPE  in  2 
patients]) vs 0.3% (1/336 patient)  
The  incidence  of  grade  3/4  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  all  trial  treatment  was  higher  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV arms than in the chemotherapy + P arms (21%, 145/694 patients vs 15%, 101/675 
patients),  although  the  increase  was  not  as  pronounced  as  for  all  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation. 
Increases  in  the  incidence  of  grade  3/4  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV arms vs chemotherapy + P arms, respectively, were seen in the following system 
organ classes: 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders: 6% (43/694 patients) vs 4% (24/675 patients) 
•  Cardiac disorders: 2% (14/694 patients) vs < 1% (1/675 patients) 
• 
Infections and infestations: 2% (12/694 patients) vs < 1% (5/675 patients) 
Nervous  system  disorders  (grade  3/4)  frequently  led  to  trial  treatment  discontinuation  in  a  similar 
proportion of patients in both treatment groups (4% [26/694 patients] in the chemotherapy + BV arms 
and 5% [33/675 patients] in the chemotherapy + P arms). 
AEs of special interest for BV (all grades) led to discontinuation of all trial treatment in 5% (36/694) 
of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  compared  with  2%  (16/675)  in  the  chemotherapy + P 
arms.  The  most  frequent  causes  of  these  treatment  discontinuations  in  the  BV  arms  were 
thromboembolic AEs (venous and arterial), accounting for 19/36 patients. With respect to the 4-arm 
comparison,  arterial  thromboembolic  events  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  with  a  similar 
frequency  in  the  XELOX + BV  and  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arms  (6 patients  each),  whereas  venous 
thromboembolic events occurred in the XELOX + BV arm only (7 patients). 
In  the  chemotherapy + P  arms,  venous  thromboembolic  events  were  the  most  frequent  cause  of 
discontinuation  of  all  trial  treatment  (8/675  patients),  occurring  with  a  similar  frequency  in  both 
XELOX + P and FOLFOX-4 + P arms. 
The  incidence  of  grade  3/4  AEs  of  special  interest  for  BV  leading  to  discontinuation  of  all  trial 
treatment  was  4%  (28/694  patients)  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  compared  with  2%  (12/675)  in 
the  chemotherapy + P  arms,  indicating  that  most  of  the  AEs  of  special  interest  for  BV  leading  to 
treatment discontinuation (28/36 in the chemotherapy + BV arms) were of grade 3/4 intensity. Similar 
to  all  AEs  of  interest  for  BV,  grade  3/4  venous  and  arterial  thromboembolic  AEs  were  the  most 
frequent  cause  of  treatment  discontinuation  in  the  BV  arms,  accounting  for  15/28  patients.  With 
respect to the 4-arm comparison, grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events leading to discontinuation 
occurred with a similar frequency in the XELOX + BV and FOLFOX-4 + BV arms (5 and 3 patients, 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively), whereas grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events leading to discontinuation occurred in 
the XELOX + BV arm only (7 patients). 
In the chemotherapy + P arms, grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events were the most frequent cause 
of  discontinuation  of  all  trial  treatment  (5/12  patients),  occurring  with  a  similar  frequency  in  both 
XELOX + P and FOLFOX-4 + P arms.  
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Modifications 
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  receiving  chemotherapy + BV  (81%  [559/694  patients])  to  those 
receiving chemotherapy + P (83% [561/675 patients]) required dose modifications for AEs. In general, 
the incidence of these AEs was similar across treatment arms in each system organ class.  
Increases  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  modifications  with  the  addition  of  BV  to  each 
treatment regimen included the following: 
In the chemotherapy + BV arms vs the chemotherapy + P arms, respectively: 
•  Vascular  disorders:  7%  (46/694  patients)  vs  4%  (25/675  patients),  attributable  to  both 
hypertension and DVT 
•  Pulmonary embolism: 2% (12/694 patients) vs 0.1% (1/675 patients) 
In the XELOX + BV arm vs the XELOX + P arm, respectively: 
•  PPE: 19% (67/353 patients) vs 9% (29/339 patients) 
•  Fatigue: 7% (23/353 patients) vs 2% (7/339 patients)  
•  Proteinuria: 3% (11/353 patients) vs < 1% (3/339 patients) 
There were no other single AEs with an increased incidence in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm compared 
with the FOLFOX-4 + P arm 
Adverse Events Requiring Treatment 
Overall,  96%  (666/694)  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  and  92%  (619/675)  in  the 
chemotherapy + P  arms  had  at  least  one  AE  requiring  treatment.  Common  gastrointestinal  toxicities 
(eg,  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting)  required  treatment  in  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  both  the 
chemotherapy + BV and chemotherapy + P arms (77% [536/694 patients] and 75% [505/675 patients], 
respectively).  Events  in  other  system  organ  classes  requiring  treatment  were  also  balanced  across 
arms.  As  was  seen  for  AEs  leading  to  dose  modifications,  vascular  events  (hypertension  and  DVT) 
more often required treatment in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared with the chemotherapy + P 
arms 
Increases  in  the  incidence  of  other  AEs  requiring  treatment  in  the  XELOX + BV  arm  vs  the 
XELOX + P arm, respectively: 
•  Stomatitis: 12% (43/353 patients) vs 7% (23/339 patients) 
•  Headache: 9% (31/353 patients) vs 4% (13/339 patients) 
There were no appreciable increases (≥ 5%) in the incidence of other AEs requiring treatment in the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV arm compared with the FOLFOX-4 + P arm. 
Events of Special Interest to Bevacizumab Study No. 16966 
The  overall  incidence  of  grade  3/4  events  pre-defined  to  be  of  special  interest  to  BV  was  16% 
(chemotherapy+BV) vs 8% (Chemotherapy+placebo). The most common of these events were venous 
thromboembolic events, hypertension, bleeding, and arterial thromboembolic events.  
Hypertension: All-grade hypertension occurred in 19% (4% grade 3/4) of BV-treated patients (vs 6% 
[1% grade 3/4] in the chemotherapy arms). The majority of hypertension events were managed with 
standard  anti-hypertensive  therapy  and  resolved  without  sequelae.  Median  time  to  onset  of 
hypertension  AEs  (all-grade)  was  not  markedly  different  between  the  arms  (9-10  weeks),  while  the 
duration of hypertension (defined as time of onset to time of resolution of the AE) was longer in the 
BV  arms  (median  15  vs  8  days).  Three  patients  experienced  grade  4  hypertension  in  the 
chemotherapy+BV  arms,  two  instances  of  which  occurred  on  the  day  of  the  infusions  of  oxaliplatin 
and  BV,  (the  other  occurring  three  days  later).  All  three  patients  had  a  history  of  hypertension,  all 
discontinued  BV  therapy,  and  all  events  resolved  with  treatment.  As  noted  in  the  prescribing 
information, BV treatment should be stopped in the case of uncontrolled hypertension or hypertensive 
crisis. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proteinuria: The incidence of grade 3 proteinuria was very low (three grade 3 events in the BV arms) 
and resolved or improved despite ongoing BV treatment. In the single case of grade 4 proteinuria, the 
event improved to grade 1 after stopping BV therapy. 
Bleeding:  The  increase  in  bleeding  events  (all-grade)  in  the  BV  arms  relative  to  the  chemotherapy 
alone  arms  was  mainly  attributable  to  grade  1  or  2  epistaxis.  The  incidence  of  clinically  significant 
bleeding (grade 3/4) was slightly higher in the BV arms (13 patients [1.9%] vs 8 patients [1.2%]) and 
comprised  mainly  GI  bleeds.  Few  bleeding  events  required  withdrawal  from  all  treatment  (five  vs 
three  in  the  Chemo+BV  vs  Chemo+P  arms).  Neither  anti-coagulant  therapy  nor  major  blood  vessel 
involvement with the tumors appeared to increase the risk of bleeding in the BV arms (24% of patients 
experienced  bleeds  while  on  anti-coagulant  therapy  vs  28%  of  patients  who  never  received  anti-
coagulant  therapy).  However,  due  to  relatively  low  patient  numbers  and  the  potential  influence  of 
other confounding factors and co-morbidities in these patients, the analyses should be interpreted with 
caution. 
GI  Perforation:  The  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  perforation  events  was  low  in  both  treatment 
groups:  0.6%  (4/694  patients)  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  and  0.3%  (2/675  patients)  in  the 
chemotherapy arms. Of the four GI perforation events in the BV arms, one was fatal, while the other 
three events resolved without sequelae after stopping study treatment. One of the two GI perforations 
in the placebo arms was fatal.  
The investigation of another event of special interest for BV was introduced into the NO16966 study 
in  order  to  assess  the  incidence  of  fistulae  and  intra-abdominal  abscesses.  The  finding  is  that  such 
events (all grades) were observed at an incidence of 2.0% in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared 
with  only  0.3%  the  chemotherapy + P  arms,  while  grade  3/4  events  were  reported  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV  arms  only  (six  patients  [0.9%]).  These  events  may  have  a  similar  underlying 
pathophysiological mechanism to events of GI perforation, yet the actual mode of action needs still to 
be further characterized for both types. 
Thromboembolic  events  (TEs):  Arterial  and  venous  TEs  were  leading  causes  of  BV-related 
discontinuation. Most events resolved without sequelae. Fatal events were rare and equally distributed 
across treatment arms. Of the twelve grade 3/4 arterial TEs in the chemotherapy+BV arms, 10 events 
occurred  within  the  first  five  weeks  of  treatment  and  six  of  the  ten  occurred  in  patients  with  no 
relevant medical history. The remaining two events with later onset were fatal and occurred in patients 
with a relevant history (NIDDM, coronary artery arteriosclerosis). The incidence of venous TEs was 
also higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms relative to the chemotherapy arms: grade 3/4 events: 7.8% 
vs 4.9%. 
The  BV-associated  increase  in  both  arterial  and  venous  TEs  was  observed  only  in  the  older 
(≥ 65 years)  age  group.  An  increase  in  incidence  of  arterial  TEs,  particularly  in  older  patients,  was 
observed in previous studies, whereas an increased incidence in venous TEs was not seen previously 
e.g.,  in  studies  AVF2107g  and  AVF2192g.  The  current  prescribing  information  recommends 
permanent  discontinuation  of  BV  treatment  in  the  case  of  an  arterial  TE  and  contains  general 
precautionary wording with respect to venous TEs such as pulmonary embolism. 
Wound healing events: Per protocol, and in line with the current label, patients were not to initiate 
BV  therapy  until  at  least  28  days  after  previous  surgery.  Only  one  patient  had  clinically  significant 
(grade 3/4) wound healing complications in the NO16966 study. 
• 
Influence of Bevacizumab on Adverse Events of Special Interest for Chemotherapy 
The  overall  incidence  of  grade  3/4  AEs  of  special  interest  for  chemotherapy  was  similar  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV and chemotherapy + P arms (57% and 55%, respectively).  
Grade  3  PPE  showed  the  biggest  difference  in  incidence  between  the  chemotherapy + BV  and  the 
chemotherapy + P arms (7% vs 3%, respectively). This increased incidence in the BV arms is driven 
by the higher percentage of patients with PPE in both XELOX arms, in particular in the XELOX + BV 
29 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
arm  (12%  in  XELOX + BV  and  6%  in  XELOX + P  arm  vs  2%  in  FOLFOX-4 + BV  and  1%  in 
FOLFOX-4 + P).  
Although diarrhea and vomiting show only a 2% increase in incidence in the chemotherapy + BV arms 
compared with the chemotherapy + P arms (17% vs 15%, and 6% vs 4%, respectively), this drives the 
overall  increase  in  incidence  of  these  grade  3/4  gastrointestinal  AEs  of  special  interest  for 
chemotherapy in the chemotherapy + BV arms (25% vs 20%, respectively).  
The  incidence  of  grade  3/4  AEs  in  the  system  organ  class  ‘cardiac  disorders’  was  higher  in  the 
chemotherapy + BV arms compared with the chemotherapy + P arms (3% [24/694] vs 0.4% [3/675], 
respectively).  Two  patients  in  the  XELOX + BV  arm  had  more  than  one  cardiac  AE:  patient 
35969/9855  experienced  atrial  fibrillation  and  cardiogenic  shock,  and  patient  42141/8760  first 
reported sinus bradycardia and later was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome. Cardiac disorders can be 
grouped by etiology as follows 
•  Arrhythmic  events  occurred  in  10  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  (3  in  FOLFOX-
• 
4 + BV, 7 in XELOX + BV) vs 1 patient in the chemotherapy + P arms (XELOX + P) 
Ischemic  type  events  occurred  in  8  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  (4  each  in 
the  chemotherapy + P  arms 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  and  XELOX + BV)  vs  1  patient 
(XELOX + P) 
in 
•  Heart  failure  events  occurred  in  2  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  only  (both  in 
FOLFOX-4 + BV) 
•  Events  of  unspecified  etiology  occurred  in  4  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  (1  in 
FOLFOX-4 + BV, 3 in XELOX + BV) vs 1 patient in the chemotherapy + P arms (FOLFOX-
4 + P) 
A by-patient review of these grade 3/4 cardiac AEs showed that in the BV arms, 13/24 patients had 
cardiac  risk  factors  present  at  baseline  (eg,  preexisting  coronary  artery  disease,  hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, diabetes). In addition, for 3/24 patients, the cardiac AEs had an alternative explanation 
(eg,  consequence  of  severe  polytrauma,  respiratory  failure  secondary  to  PD,  or  due  to  sepsis  and 
respiratory  failure).  For  the  remaining  8/24  patients,  there  were  no  common  underlying  patterns  to 
explain these AEs. In the chemotherapy + P arms, 1/3 patients had identifiable cardiac risk factors at 
baseline (ie, hypertension, cholesterolemia, and preexisting coronary artery disease).  
Of the above, grade 3/4 cardiac AEs had a fatal outcome in 7 patients in the chemotherapy + BV arms 
(these include patients that died as a consequence of severe polytrauma, respiratory failure secondary 
to  PD,  or  due  to  sepsis  and  respiratory  failure)  and  in  1  patient  in  the  chemotherapy + P  arms.  In 
addition, 4 patients (3 in the chemotherapy + BV arms and 1 in the chemotherapy + P arms) died of a 
cardiac-related cause. However, for these 4 patients either the AE was not classified under the system 
organ  class  ‘cardiac  disorders’  (eg,  AE  of  sudden  death  which  is  coded  to  the  system  organ  class 
‘general disorders and administration site conditions’), or death occurred more than 28 days after last 
administration of study medication in which case the cardiac AE was not collected for these patients. 
In  total,  cardiac-related  deaths  occurred  in  10  patients  in  the  chemotherapy + BV  arms  and  in  2 
patients in the chemotherapy + P arms.  
On review of the 10 death cases in the chemotherapy + BV arms 4 had underlying causes other than 
cardiac  disorders  (2 had  PD,  1  car  accident,  1  sepsis).  Of  the  remaining  6  cases,  all  had  identifiable 
cardiac risk factors at baseline. 
Summary of Laboratory Abnormalities 
In general, the addition of BV to the XELOX or the FOLFOX-4 treatment regimen did not increase 
the incidence of laboratory abnormalities for either treatment. The only difference between treatment 
arms  was  seen  for  increases  in  the  incidence  of  high  potassium  levels  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm 
relative to the FOLFOX-4 + P arm (grade 1-4: 18.5% vs 13.1%, respectively).

Adverse Events in Study E3200 
Comparison of the safety profile between the two principal treatment arms in the E3200 study has a 
number of limitations, which should be borne in mind: 
•  AEs reported on E3200 Toxicity Form were considered ‘related’ to protocol therapy and as a 
consequence reporting is influenced by investigators’ attribution of causality in this open-label 
study. 
•  Events 
of  
causality,  may  have  been  affected  by  different  expedited  reporting  requirements  across  the 
treatment arms 
in  NCI  AdEERS,  while 
attribution 
reported 
affected 
not 
by 
•  Duration of safety observation was greater in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm than in the FOLFOX-
4 arm. 
•  Discontinuations and dose modifications for AEs were collected retrospectively and only for 
BV-related events. 
The duration of safety observation (defined as the number of weeks from initiation of protocol therapy 
until the last toxicity assessment) was longer in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm than in the FOLFOX-4 arm 
(median 26.5 vs 18.1 weeks). The incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 AEs was increased in the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  versus  the  FOLFOX-4  arm.  Deaths  within  30  days  of  last  dose  of  protocol 
therapy  were  mostly  attributed  to  PD  in  both  treatment  arms.  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  or  dose 
modification  of  BV  were  collected  retrospectively:  29%  of  patients  had  AEs  leading  to  BV 
discontinuation and 20% had AEs leading to BV dose reduction. 
The data on toxicity in this trial are not optimal, but they are as usually performed in ECOG studies. 
As far as one can judge from the data, there is no cause for concern. 
•  Common Adverse Events  
Overall, 76% and 60% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 + BV and FOLFOX-4 arms, respectively, 
reported at least one grade 3–5 non-hematological or grade 4 or 5 hematological AE considered 
related to protocol therapy. The most frequently reported AEs in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm vs the 
FOLFOX-4 arm, respectively, were:  
•  Diarrhea: 18% vs 13%  
•  Fatigue: 18% vs 13% 
•  Peripheral sensory neuropathy: 16% vs 9% 
•  Nausea: 11% vs 4% 
•  Vomiting: 10% vs 3% 
These AEs are commonly known to be associated with chemotherapy treatment.  
Of the most frequently reported AEs, an additional 10 treatment-related events were reported in NCI 
AdEERS in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm only: 3 AEs of nausea, 2 of vomiting, 3 of infection, 1 of 
hypertension, and 1 of abdominal pain.  
The greatest differences in incidence of AEs between treatment arms were:  
•  Peripheral sensory neuropathy: 16.4% vs 9.1%  
•  Vomiting: 10.1% vs 3.2%  
•  Nausea: 10.8% vs 4.2%  
•  Fatigue: 18.5% vs 13.0% 
Similar results were seen for the most common AEs reported either in the E3200 Toxicity Form or in 
NCI  AdEERS.  Peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  is  generally  associated  with  the  chemotherapy,  but 
bevacizumab seems to increase the risk of this complication. The increased risk of adverse events is 
within  the  range  of  the  expected,  considering  the  known  toxicity  profile  of  bevacizumab,  and 
considering the fact that this was an open-label study where both patient and investigator knew that the 
patients  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  received  this  additional  experimental  therapy.  This  fact  may  well 
have influenced the awareness of side effects in the bevacizumab arm.

•  Deaths 
All Deaths  
Among  treated  patients,  254  (89%)  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  and  259  (91%)  in  the  FOLFOX-4 
arm  died  during  the  study  or  in  follow-up.  Causes  of  death  were  similar  across  treatment  arms;  the 
majority of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be due to CRC. One patient’s death was 
attributed  to  both  disease  progression  and  protocol  therapy  (sepsis  syndrome).  Fifteen  deaths  were 
categorized as ‘due to another causes’, although the cause was given as CRC in two of these cases. 
Deaths within 30 Days of Last Dose of Study Medication 
Consistent with all reported deaths, the majority of deaths within 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
therapy in both treatment arms were considered by the investigator to be due to CRC. 
Adverse Events Leading to Death 
In total, 17 patients in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and 11 patients in the FOLFOX-4 arm had grade 5 
AEs reported either in the E3200 Toxicity Form or in NCI AdEERS). The majority of these AEs were 
considered  unrelated  to  protocol  therapy  (reported  mainly  in  AdEERS)  and  9  AEs  were  directly 
attributed to disease progression (3 patients in FOLFOX-4 + BV and 6 patients in FOLFOX-4).  
Five  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  experienced  grade  5  AEs  considered  related  to  protocol 
therapy either as reported in the E3200 Toxicity Form, or in in NCI AdEERS, or as cause of death in 
the E3200 Long-Term Follow-up Form. None of the events were reported in more than one patient. 
•  Other Serious Adverse Events 
Expedited reporting of AEs in Study E3200 was conducted via NCI  AdEERS. Since the  criteria for 
expedited reporting of AEs were different in each treatment arm, comparisons between treatment arms 
must be interpreted with caution.  
A total of 123/287 patients (42.9%) in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm experienced at least one event that 
required expedited reporting in NCI AdEERS. The most frequent AEs requiring expedited reporting in 
this treatment arm were diarrhea (6.3%, 18/287 patients), vomiting (6.3%, 18/287 patients), infection 
(6.3%, 18/287 patients), and dehydration (5.2%, 15/287 patients). 
A total of 75/285 patients (26.3%) in the FOLFOX-4 arm experienced at least one event that required 
expedited  reporting  in  NCI  AdEERS.  The  most  frequent  AEs  requiring  expedited  reporting  in  this 
treatment  arm  were  dehydration  (3.5%,  10/285  patients),  infection  (3.5%,  10/285  patients),  and 
pyrexia (3.2%, 9/285 patients).  
•  Other Significant Adverse Events 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Modification of Bevacizumab 
Protocol-specified  criteria  for  BV  dose  reduction  were  grade  1/2  hypertension,  grade  2  hemorrhage, 
grade 2 coagulopathy, grade 3/4 liver function test abnormalities, or proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/24 h. Lower 
grades  of  AEs  were  collected  on  these  forms  compared  to  the  AEs  collected  in  the  E3200  Toxicity 
Forms  (ie,  grade  4-5  hematological  and  grade  3-5  non-hematological  AEs).  Therefore,  comparisons 
between the datasets are not possible. 
The  E3200  Bevacizumab  Dose  Modification  Form  was  collected  for  241  of  287  treated  patients 
(84.0%).  Among  the  241  patients  with  any  dose  modification  data,  the  BV  dose  was  reported  as 
reduced from 10 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for toxicity in 47 patients (20%). The most common AEs leading 
to dose modification were hypertension (10% [23/241]) and proteinuria (9% [21/241]). Hypertension 
events resolved or improved in 18/23 patients (78.3%), note that treatments received for AEs were not 
collected,  as  per  standard  NCI-CTC  AE  reporting  procedures).  Proteinuria  events  resolved  or 
improved  in  15/21  patients  (71.4%).  Most  other  events  resolved  or  improved.  No  patient  reported  a 
dose reduction for liver function test abnormalities.  
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Bevacizumab 
AEs that led to discontinuation of BV were retrospectively collected in the BV discontinuation section 
the  E3200  Bevacizumab  Dose  Modification  Form.  Protocol-specified  criteria  for  BV 
of 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
discontinuation  included  grade ≥ 3  hypertension,  grade ≥ 3  hemorrhage,  grade ≥ 3  coagulopathy,  a 
new  or  worsening  grade ≥ 2  arterial  thromboembolic  event,  or  any  protocol-specified  AE  requiring 
BV dose reduction for a patient who had already had one reduction. 
Among the 241 patients with BV discontinuation data, BV was reported as discontinued for toxicity in 
69  patients  (29%).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  BV  discontinuation  were  hypertension  (7% 
[16/241]) and fatigue (4% [10/241]).  
Adverse Events of Special Interest - Study E3200 
A  summary  of  treatment-related  grade  3-5  AEs  of  special  interest  for  BV  reported  in  the  E3200 
Toxicity Form only and recoded using MedDRA show as expected, more patients in the FOLFOX-4 + 
BV arm experienced at least one AE of special interest for BV (15% vs 5% in FOLFOX-4 arm). The 
most common of these AEs was hypertension (6% vs 2%). 
Hypertension:  The  incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  3/4  hypertension  was  increased  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  compared  with  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (6.3%  [18/287  patients]  vs  1.8%  [5/285 
patients],  respectively).  One  additional  AE  of  hypertension  was  reported  in  NCI  AdEERS  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm,  giving  an  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  3/4  hypertension  of 
6.6% (19/287 patients) in this arm compared with 1.8% (5/285 patients) in the FOLFOX-4 arm.  
Proteinuria: The incidence of treatment-related proteinuria was 0.7% (2/287) in the FOLFOX-4 + BV 
arm.  No  events  were  reported  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm.  No  grade  4  or  5  proteinuria  events  were 
reported. No additional proteinuria AEs were reported in NCI AdEERS. 
Bleeding:  The  incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  3–5  bleeding  events  was  increased  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  compared  with  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (3.8%  [11/287  patients]  vs  0.4%  [1/285 
patient],  respectively).  In  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm,  1  patient  (2000137/33033)  had  grade  5 
hemorrhage.  The  incidence  of  grade  3-5  bleeding  events  reported  either  in  the  Toxicity  Form  or  in 
AdEERS  was  4.9%  (14/287  patients)  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  and  0.7%  (2/285 patients)  in  the 
FOLFOX-4  arm.  Two  grade  5  events  were  reported  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  (gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage and cerebral hemorrhage). 
Gastrointestinal Perforation, Intra-Abdominal Abscess, and Fistula Adverse Events: There is no 
unique term  or grade for gastrointestinal perforation or abscess  events in NCI-CTC version 2.0. For 
this reason, verbatim AE terms were not collected on the E3200 Toxicity Form, and fistula events not 
considered  related  to  protocol  therapy  were  also  not  collected  on  the  E3200  Toxicity  Form. 
Identification  of  these  events  was  performed  by  a  Genentech  review  of  data  from  both  the  E3200 
Toxicity Form and NCI AdEERS reports. 
No  treatment–related  grade  3-5  AEs  of  gastrointestinal  perforation  were  reported  in  the  E3200 
Toxicity  Form.  However,  gastrointestinal  perforations  were  reported  in  NCI  AdEERS  for  5/287 
patients  (1.7%)  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  only.  One  of  these  events  was  associated  with  death 
within 30 days of the event.  
No treatment–related grade 3-5 AEs of intra-abdominal abscesses were reported in the E3200 Toxicity 
Form. However, intra-abdominal abscess was reported in NCI AdEERS for 6/287 (2.1%) patients in 
the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  only.  Among  these  patients,  3  were  not  considered  to  have  had  a 
gastrointestinal perforation event. 
In the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm, treatment-related grade 3/4 fistula was reported in 2/287 patients (0.7%) 
in  the  E3200  Toxicity  Form.  If  AEs  reported  in  NCI  AdEERS  are  taken  into  account,  fistula  was 
reported  in  5/287  (1.7%)  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  and  in  1/287  (0.4%)  patient  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 arm. Among these patients, 3 in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and 1 in the FOLFOX-4 arm 
were not considered to have had a gastrointestinal perforation event. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Venous  Thromboembolic  Events:  The  verbatim  term  thrombosis/embolism  has  been  translated  by 
MedDRA into embolism. There are no other embolism terms recorded in the glossaries.  
The overall incidence of treatment-related grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events as reported in the 
E3200  Toxicity  Form  was  similar  in  both  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  (3.5%,  10/287  patients)  and 
FOLFOX-4 (2.5%, 7/285 patients) arms. No grade 5 events were reported. 
The  incidence  of  grade  3–5  venous  thromboembolic  events  reported  either  on  the  E3200  Toxicity 
Form or in NCI AdEERS was 4.2% (12/287 patients) in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and 3.5% (10/285 
patients)  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm.  One  grade  5  venous  thromboembolic  event  was  reported  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 arm. 
Arterial  Thromboembolic  Events:  The 
treatment-related  grade  3/4  arterial 
thromboembolic  events  was  rare  in  the  two  treatment  arms:  0.3%  (1/287  patient)  in  the  FOLFOX-
4 + BV arm and 0.4% (1/285 patient) in the FOLFOX-4 arm. In addition, 2 patients in the FOLFOX-
4 + BV  arm  had  grade  3/4  treatment-related  troponin  I  elevation,  which  according  to  NCI-CTC  is 
consistent with unstable angina (grade 3) and myocardial infarction (grade 4).  
incidence  of 
The incidence of grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events reported either in the E3200 Toxicity Form 
or in NCI AdEERS was 2.4% (7/287 patients) in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and 0.7% (2/285 patients) 
in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (includes  patients  with  troponin  I  elevation).  One  grade  5  event  (cerebral 
ischemia) was reported in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm. 
Wound Healing Complications: Wound infection (grade 3) was reported in 1 patient (0.3%) in the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  only.  No  additional  wound  healing  complications  were  reported  in  NCI 
AdEERS  
Overall,  as  the  reporting  in  the  AdEERS  was  not  uniform  between  the  two  treatment  arms,  these 
information are of somewhat limited value. The character of the events is compatible with the known 
toxicity of bevacizumab, and therefore do not give cause for concern. 
Study E3200 Influence of Bevacizumab on Adverse Events of Special Interest for Chemotherapy 
More  patients  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  experienced  at  least  one  AE  of  special  interest  for 
chemotherapy compared with those in the FOLFOX-4 arm (37% vs 25%, respectively). 
Sensory  Neuropathy:  The  incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  3/4  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy 
events was higher in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm (16.4%, 47/287) compared with the FOLFOX-4 arm 
(9.1%,  26/285),  as  reported  in  the  E3200  Toxicity  Form.  No  grade  5  events  were  reported,  and  for 
each treatment arm, only 1 grade 4 event was reported. No additional peripheral sensory neuropathy 
events were reported in NCI AdEERS.  
Diarrhea:  The  incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  3/4  diarrhea  events  was  higher  in  the  FOLFOX-
4 + BV arm (17.8%, 51/287) compared with the FOLFOX-4 arm (12.6%, 36/285), as reported in the 
E3200 Toxicity Form. No grade 5 events were reported. No additional diarrhea events were reported 
in NCI AdEERS. 
Nausea and Vomiting: The incidence of treatment-related grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting events was 
higher  in  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  (13.6%,  39/287)  compared  with  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (6.0%, 
17/285),  as  reported  in  the  E3200  Toxicity  Form.  No  grade  5  events  were  reported  and  no  grade  4 
nausea events were reported.  
The incidence of grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting events reported either in the E3200 Toxicity Form or 
in NCI AdEERS was 15.3% (44/287 patients) in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm vs 6.3% (18/285 patients) 
in the FOLFOX-4 arm.  
Stomatitis:  No  treatment-related  grade  4  or  5  stomatitis events  were  reported  in  the  E3200  Toxicity 
Form.  The  incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  3  events  was  low  and  similar  in  the  two  treatment 
arms: 1.7% (5/287 patients) in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and 1.1% (3/285) in the FOLFOX-4 arm. No 
additional stomatitis events were reported in NCI AdEERS.

Safety in Special Groups and Situations across studies 
Intrinsic Factors - Gender 
A consistent effect of BV on the key events of interest was seen across male and female subgroups. 
Possible  exceptions  are  grade  3/4  hypertension  that  occurred  with  a  higher  frequency  in  female 
patients compared with male patients in the BV arms, and grade 3/4 proteinuria that was only seen in 
female patients in the BV arms, although the number was small (4 patients).  
Intrinsic Factors - Age 
A consistent effect of BV on the key AEs of interest was seen across age subgroups with the exception 
that an increase in arterial and venous thromboembolic events was seen with BV in patients ≥ 65 years 
compared with those < 65 years  
Extrinsic factors : Comparison of Safety Profile of Bevacizumab in Combination with Different 
Chemotherapy Regimens  
Oxaliplatin-Based Regimens 
A comparison of the safety profile of BV in combination with various oxaliplatin-based regimens from 
the TREE-2 (ARD 5099) and NO16966 studies show that overall tolerability was similar in the two 
studies and across the various regimens, with approximately 70% to 85% of patients reporting grade 
3/4  AEs.  In  general,  the  incidences  of  grade  3/4  AEs  of  special  interest  for  BV  were  lower  in  the 
NO16966 study compared with TREE-2, in particular, hypertension (range across BV treatment arms 
of  3.2%  to  4.2%  vs  7%  to  15%,  respectively),  gastrointestinal  perforation  (range  0.3%  to  0.8%  vs 
2.8%  to  4.2%,  respectively),  and  wound  healing  complications  (range  0  to  0.3%  vs  1.4%  to  5.6%, 
respectively).  Incidences  of  grade  3/4  chemotherapy-related  AEs,  however,  were  similar  in  both 
studies. The difference in patient numbers between the two studies warrants caution when comparing 
incidences of AEs between these studies. In addition, as Roche was not the sponsor of the TREE study 
and does not have access to the safety database, this complicates the comparison across studies further, 
especially with respect to lack of information regarding exposure to BV.  
Although the patient population and safety reporting requirements were different for study E3200, the 
incidences of grade 3/4 AEs of special interest for BV and for chemotherapy are generally comparable 
to those for NO16966 and TREE-2. 
Incidences of grade 3/4 AEs of special interest for BV are also generally comparable to those reported 
in  the  ongoing,  observational  studies  MO18024  (First  BEAT)  and  AVF2941n  (BRiTE),  although 
safety data collection in these latter studies is limited.  
Other Fluoropyrimidine-Based Regimens 
The updated safety profile of BV in combination with other fluoropyrimidine-based regimens from the 
pivotal phase III study AVF2107g and the phase II study AVF2192g is compared to that of NO16966 
(pooled chemotherapy + BV arms vs chemotherapy + P arms). The overall tolerability of the different 
combination  therapies  across  the  three  studies  was  similar,  with  approximately  75%  of  patients 
reporting  grade  3/4  AEs.  Of  the  grade  3/4  AEs  of  special  interest  for  BV,  the  following  were 
consistently increased in the BV arms over control in the three studies: hypertension (3.7% - 15% vs 
1.2% – 2.5%), arterial thromboembolic events (1.7% – 9.0% vs 1.0% - 4.8%), bleeding events (1.9% - 
5.0% vs 1.2% - 2.9%), and gastrointestinal perforations (0.6% - 2.0% vs 0% - 0.3%). All these types 
of events had a lower frequency in the NO16966 trial than in the previous trials in mCRC. 
With  respect  to  grade  3/4  AEs  of  special  interest  for  chemotherapy,  small  increases  in  the  common 
gastrointestinal toxicities were seen in the BV arms in all three trials. In study NO16966 there was also 
an increase in the incidence of PPE in the BV arms compared with the chemotherapy arms (7.1% vs 
3.4%), mainly driven by higher incidences of this AE in the XELOX arms.

Pharmacovigilance  
The  applicant  has  provided  an  updated  RMP  which  replaces  the  second  RMP  dated  June  2006  and 
include  satisfactorily  the  current  and  planned  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities 
associated with the use of bevacizumab in oncology indications. The important identified and potential 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
risks of the clinical use of bevacizumab in Genentech- and Roche-sponsored studies, risk minimisation 
activities as defined in the current bevacizumab label, experience from the post-marketing setting after 
initial approval in the US (26 February 2004) and the EU (12 January 2005) and pharmacovigilance 
activities proposed and implemented in ongoing and planned studies are adequately described. 
The  RMP  has  been  updated  with  newly  available  data  from  the  following  studies:  NO16966  (in 
metastatic colorectal cancer), BO17705 (in metastatic renal cell carcinoma), AVF3135g (a dedicated 
drug-drug interaction study) and AVF2771n (a pilot dose-escalation study in paediatric patients). For 
the  indications  of  locally  recurrent  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  and  locally  advanced  and  metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer, for which approval is being sought, observational studies are ongoing in 
order to gather more and long-term safety data in a systematic manner.   
In  addition,  ongoing  clinical  trials  are  evaluating  ovarian  failure,  anticoagulation  therapy  in 
combination with bevacizumab containing treatments and the safety profile of bevacizumab in patients 
with Central Nervous System metastases and patients with squamous NSCLC. A cardiac monitoring 
plan has been implemented for investigational purposes together with the planned QTc study. 
Specific safety assessments of events related to gastrointestinal perforations, haemorrhage (including 
thromboembolic  events, 
pulmonary  haemorrhage),  wound  healing  complications,  arterial 
hypertension,  proteinuria,  congestive  heart  failure  will  continue  to  be  carried  out  prospectively  in 
clinical trials.  
4. 
OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RISK BENEFIT 
This application is based on two large pivotal Phase III studies, one in patients not previously treated 
for their metastatic disease (first-line treatment), Study NO16966, and the other in previously treated 
patients (second-line treatment), Study E3200. Due to differences in the definition of the primary and 
secondary  efficacy  parameters  (e.g.  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  NO16966  was  PFS  whereas  the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  E3200  was  overall  survival),  and  due  to  differences  in  the  study 
population (demographics and baseline disease characteristics), no integrated comparison between the 
studies NO16966 and E3200 could be made. 
Study NO16966 
Study NO1699 is also assessed as a part of the Xeloda (capecitabine) extension of the CRC indication 
In the subgroup comparison of XELOX+P and XELOX+BV a statistically significant prolongation of 
PFS of 57 days in favour of the bevacizumab combination was found (HR=0.77, p=0.0026). However, 
in  the  subgroup  comparison  of  FOLFOX+P  vs.  FOLFOX+BV  there  was  no  significant  difference 
between the arms (HR=0.89, p=0.1871). An imbalance with regard to an important prognostic factor 
(the  time  between  primary  treatment  and  recurrence),  which  was  not  recognized  when  the  trial  was 
started, can explain the seemingly superior result in the FOLFOX-P arm in part II of the trial 
PFS  as  assessed  by  IRC  and  by  On-treatment  approach  showed  significant  benefit  of  adding 
bevacizumab to chemotherapy in the overall comparison and in both treatment subgroups. However, 
due to the definition of event in the PFS - IRC and the PFS on-treatment approach these analyses are 
regarded to be of little relevance for the assessment of effect size.  
Mature  overall  survival  (OS)  data  from  part  II  of  NO16966  (62.5%  patients  have  died)  are  now 
available after an analysis performed with an additional 12 months of follow-up (34% of patients had 
died at the cut-off for the primary analysis). 
The result shows a trend for longer OS with BV compared with placebo (median 92.3 weeks vs. 86.6 
weeks, HR=0.89) however statistical significance was not reached (p=0.0769). Two key factors may 
have reduced the magnitude of OS benefit observed: 
o  Early discontinuation of BV therapy 
o  The  impact  of  a  cohort  with  an  outlying  efficacy  result:  patients  with  previous  adjuvant 
treatment  in  the  FOLFOX+P  arm  had  a  more  favourable  baseline  characteristic  (longer 
time from start of adjuvant therapy to randomisation) than the cohorts of adjuvant-treated 
patients in the other treatment arms. This may explain the unexpectedly good outcome in 
36 
   
 
 
 
 
 
the  FOLFOX-4+P  arm.  A  Cox  regression  model  confirmed  that  time  from  start  of 
adjuvant chemotherapy to randomization (recurrence) has an influence on OS. 
Three exploratory analyses, aimed at reducing the impact of this cohort on OS, show a significant OS 
benefit of BV vs. Placebo in the 2x2 factorial part II of NO16966. Moreover, an exploratory analysis 
of  OS  including  all  patients  in  NO16966  (from  part  I  and  II)  shows  a  similar  result.  An  overall 
survival benefit has therefore also been shown in this study. 
No  increase  in  BOR  was  observed  when  adding  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy,  neither  in  the 
investigator nor IRC analyses. The highest discordance between investigator and IRC assessments was 
due to partial responses by investigators being classified as stable disease by IRC. Time to response 
was similar between treatment arms and the majority of responses (70 %) occurred between week 6 
and week 18. In the overall comparison the duration of response was longer for patients who received 
bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with patients who received chemotherapy 
alone (HR=0.82, p=0.031) while duration of response was not significantly prolonged in either of the 
treatment  subgroups.  The  time  to  treatment  failure  increased  in  the  overall  comparison  analyses  (26 
days,  HR=0.84,  p=0.003)  and  the  XELOX  treatment  subgroup  (32  days,  HR=0.80,  p=0.007),  while 
there  was  no  significant  benefit  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  FOLFOX-4.  It  seems  quite  plausible  that 
the  imbalance  with  regard  to  an  important  prognostic  variable  (not  recognized  when  the  trial  was 
started)  gave  rise  to  the  unexpected  result  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  treated  with  FOLFOX-4. 
Analyses correcting (partially) for this imbalance clearly point in that direction.  
A multivariable analysis adjusting for prognostic factors, stratification variables and geographic region 
was  performed  and  the  results  confirmed  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the  PFS  primary  efficacy 
analyses  for  the  overall  comparison  and  in  each  treatment  subgroup.  Sensitivity  analyses  were 
performed to investigate whether or not delays in tumour assessments had any effect on the outcome 
of the primary analyses for PFS, and the results confirm the primary analysis in the overall comparison 
and the treatment subgroup comparisons, and thus indicate that delays in tumour assessments did not 
affect the outcome of the primary analysis of PFS. A superiority analysis which combined all patients 
in the trial (patients in 2-arm part plus patients in 2x2 factorial part of the study) was specified in the 
protocol in case of borderline results. This analysis was performed, and demonstrated superiority for 
the  BV-containing  arms  versus  the  chemotherapy  alone  arms  in  the  overall  comparison  and  the 
XELOX  treatment  subgroup,  and  in  addition  significant  improvement  of  adding  bevacizumab  to 
FOLFOX-4 was obtained (HR=0.82, p=0.0080). However, the validity of combining the two parts of 
the  study  may  be  questioned,  and  does  not  alter  conclusions  based  on  the  primary  analysis.  A  clear 
distinction  between  patients  who  received  prior  adjuvant  chemotherapy  and  those  who  did  not  was 
demonstrated  in  the  subgroup  analysis  of  the  FOLFOX-4  treatment  subgroup.  Therefore  additional 
exploratory  analyses  were  performed  and  these  analyses  showed  that  removing  the  subgroup  of 
patients  that  may  have  slower  tumour  progression,  improved  the  results,  and  even  the  subgroup 
analysis  of  FOLFOX-4  became  significant  in  favour  of  addition  of  bevacizumab.  As  mentioned 
previously,  an  imbalance  with  regard  to  an  important  prognostic  factor  (the  time  between  primary 
treatment  and  recurrence),  which  was  not  recognized  when  the  trial  was  started,  can  explain  these 
results. However, this is a post-hoc analysis which must be assessed with great caution.  
Taken  together,  the  PFS  and  OS  for  the  overall  comparison  shows  that  adding  bevacizumab  to 
chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone.  
Study E3200  
Study E3200 (an open-label, randomised, multicenter, active-controlled Phase III trial to evaluate the 
safety  and  efficacy  of  FOLFOX-4+bevacizumab  versus  FOLFOX-4  versus  bevacizumab  alone  in 
patients with advanced CRC who have failed therapy with irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil) showed that 
overall  survival  was  significantly  longer  for  patients  in  the  FOLFOX+BV  arm  (13.0 months) 
compared with patients in the FOLFOX-4 arm (10.8 months). (Stratified HR=0.751, p = 0.0012). The 
difference  in  median  PFS  was  3  months  in  favour  of  the  FOLFOX-4 + BV  patients,  which  is  both 
statistically  and  clinically  significant.  The  objective  response  rate  was  13.6  %  higher  in  the 
FOLFOX-4+BV arm than in the FOLFOX-4 arm, as a result of increased partial response among the 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
patients. There was no difference in median duration of objective response, 6.2 months vs. 6.0 monts 
in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm and FOLFOX-4 arm, respectively.   
The  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  consistent  with  those  for  the  randomised  population  as  a 
whole.  There  was  an  overall  consistent  trend  for  prolonged  duration  of  survival  for  patients  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 + BV  arm  compared  with  those  in  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  regardless  of  the  baseline  risk 
factor examined. Additionally, after adjusting for important prognostic factors for overall survival, the 
estimated  hazard  ratio  indicated  an  approximately  30%  reduction  in  the  hazard  of  death  among 
patients who received FOLFOX-4 + BV treatment compared with those who received FOLFOX-4, and 
thus  support  the  primary  analysis  (HR=0.693  p<0.0001).  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  using 
two definitions of lost to follow-up: last contact date > 3 months and > 6 months prior to the date of 
the final database. Results from stratified analyses showed that duration of survival was improved in 
the  FOLFOX-4+bevacizumab  arm  compared  with  the  FOLFOX-4  arm  (HR=0.740,  p=0.0004  and 
HR= 0.736, p=0.0004, respectively), supporting the results of the primary analysis.   
Exploratory  analyses  of  duration  of  survival,  PFS,  and  objective  response  were  performed  for  the 
bevacizumab monotherapy arm, which was closed for enrolment 11 March 2003. The stratified hazard 
ratio  for  death  for  bevacizumab  monotherapy  relative  to  FOLFOX-4+BV  was  1.327,  p=0.0021. 
However,  it  is  notable  that  median  OS  in  the  BV  monotherapy  arm  was  not  significantly  different 
from the FOLFOX-4 arm (10.2 months and 10.8 months, respectively (p=0.7631)). In addition, there 
seemed to be less toxicity in the BV monotherapy arm in comparison to FOLFOX-4. The PFS in the 
BV arm was 2 months (p<0.0001) and 5 months (p<0.0001) shorter than the PFS in FOLFOX-4 and 
FOLFOX-4+BV arm, respectively. Additionally, the ORR was significantly lower (p=0.0121) in the 
BV  monotherapy  treatment  arm.  Symptomatic  deterioration,  which  was  assessed  for  the  treated 
patients,  was  equally  distributed  across  the  three  treatment  arms.  However,  there  were  significantly 
more  patients  who  experienced  symptomatic  deterioration  without  disease  progression  in  the 
FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab (67.5%) arm compared to the other treatment arms, FOLFOX-4 (50.0%) 
and  BV  monotherapy  (42.4%).  The  results  of  a  supportive  Bayesian  analysis  were  in  line  with  the 
results of the primary analysis and indicated that it is highly likely that FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab is 
superior both to FOLFOX-4 and to bevacizumab monotherapy as measured by duration of survival. 
In  conclusion,  adding  bevacizumab  to  FOLFOX-4  has  benefit  compared  to  FOLFOX-4  alone  when 
given as second line therapy.  
Overall;  the  benefit  derived  through  the  addition  of  BV  to  oxaliplatin-containing  chemotherapy,  in 
terms  of  prolonged  PFS  on  treatment  (studies  NO16966  and  E3200),  and  overall  survival  (study 
E3200) is in line with previous experience with other combinations (5FU/LV and irinotecan plus 5FU) 
in mCRC. Statistically significant and clinical meaningful efficacy with regards to a prolongation of 
PFS has been demonstrated in combination with oxaliplatin-based therapy. A superior survival benefit 
has  also  been  demonstrated  in  patients  previously  treated  with  irinotecan  for  whom  no  other 
therapeutic option with a proven survival benefit exists (study E3200). 
The data further support the consistent benefit of BV seen in combination with a variety of cytotoxic 
agents  in  a  number  of  indications.  The  lack  of  substantial  potentiation  of  chemotherapy-related 
toxicity (owing to the different mechanism of action and non-overlapping toxicity profile) makes BV a 
favorable and well-tolerated partner to cytotoxic therapy. Despite continual improvements in outcome 
with  cytotoxic  therapies  and  new  and  improved  combinations  of  these  agents,  BV  is  still  able  to 
provide additional benefit without significantly impacting overall tolerability. 
Safety 
A  total  of  2864  patients  with  mCRC  were  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of  bevacizumab  in  the  two 
studies; N016966 and E3200. In study NO16966, the median duration of chemotherapy treatment was 
similar  between  the  BV  arms  and  their  corresponding  placebo  arms  (approx.  6  months)  whereas  in 
study E3200 the median duration was longer in the BV arm.   
The overall safety profile of BV in combination with oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine-containing therapy 
is comparable to that observed in previous phase II and III studies in combination with other 5-FU-
38 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
based therapies (5-FU/LV and IFL). No significant new safety concerns have been identified. Many of 
the  observed  adverse  events  are  typically  described  in  patients  who  receive  chemotherapy  e.g. 
constipation,  diarrhoea,  arthralgia,  alopecia,  rash,  fatigue/asthenia,  nausea  and  vomiting.  Similar  to 
other  bevacizumab  studies,  the  higher  incidence  of  bleeding,  hypertension,  epistaxis,  headache  and 
proteinuria is observed with bevacizumab treatment. 
In study NO16966, there were more AEs (all grades) in the chemotherapy+BV arms compared with 
the  chemotherapy+P  arms  (≥  5%  absolute  difference:  anorexia,  hypertension,  PPE,  epistaxis  and 
dysphonia). The incidences of Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal disorders, vascular disorders, cardiac disorder 
and pulmonary embolism were increased in both BV arms whereas PPE was mainly increased in the 
XELOX+BV  arm.  Gastrointestinal  perforations,  proteinuria  and  wound  healing  complications  were 
rare in both treatment arms. There were no major differences between the pooled treatment arms for 
the most commonly occurring individual SAEs, with the exception of pulmonary embolism and deep 
vein  thrombosis.  A  higher  proportion  of  patients  discontinued  all  study  treatment  due  to  AEs  in  the 
BV treatment arms mainly due to chemotherapy-related toxicity; however, only 5% of the patients in 
the  BV  treatment  arms  and  2%  in  the  placebo  arms  discontinued  all  study  treatment  due  to  AEs  of 
special interest for BV. With respect to the non-PD related deaths, the causes were generally similar 
between  groups;  however,  more  deaths  in  the  chemotherapy+BV  arm  than  in  the  chemotherapy+P 
group  were  related  to  cardiac  etiologies  (10  patients,  1.4%  vs.  2  patients,  0.3%,  respectively)  or 
gastrointestinal obstruction (4 patients, < 1% vs. no patients). 
In study E3200, grade 3/4 hypertension, grade 3-5 bleeding, and grade 3-5 gastrointestinal perforation 
were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  of  special  interest  for  BV  (all  grades),  all  of  which  were 
experienced by a higher proportion of patients in the FOLFOX-4+BV arm. There was no appreciable 
increase  in  the  incidence  of  grade  3–5  venous  thromboembolic  events  with  the  addition  of  BV  to 
FOLFOX-4.  Proteinuria,  arterial  thromboembolic  events,  and  wound  healing  complications  were 
either rare or absent in both treatment arms.  
The incidences of Grade 3 and 4 sensory neuropathy events were higher in the FOLFOX-4+BV arm 
compared with the FOLFOX-4 arm. Sensory neuropathy is an adverse event known to be associated 
with oxaliplatin and the higher incidence in the FOLFOX-4+BV arm is probably due to the increased 
oxaliplatin exposure in this arm compared with the arm without BV. In study NO16966 there was no 
difference  in  the  observed  sensory  neuropathy  between  the  chemotherapy+BV  arms  and  the 
chenmotherapy+P arms. The proportion of patients who discontinued all protocol therapy for toxicity 
was similar between the treatment arms. Cardiac-related deaths (9 patients) and infections (7 patients) 
were  the  most  frequent  causes  of  non-PD  related  deaths  in  the  chemotherapy+BV  arms  while 
infections (5 patients) were the most frequent cause in the chemotherapy+P arms.

Benefit-Risk 
In conclusion, the benefit  risk profile of BV treatment remains positive based on the data  generated 
from  the  studies  in  this  submission.  The  current  prescribing  information  and  risk  management  plan 
adequately address the identified risks associated with BV treatment (events of special interest).

Furthermore, the MAH will provide for the study NO16966 the result of a multiple Cox regression 
analysis for the overall comparison of XELOX+BV/FOLFOX-4+BV versus XELOX+P/FOLFOX-
4+P in the ITT in terms of PFS by end of 1Q08 and will update the prescribing information 
accordingly, if supported by the results of the mentioned Cox regression analysis. The model will 
include the following covariates 1) bevacizumab treatment (yes vs. no); 2) chemotherapy backbone 
(FOLFOX-4 vs. XELOX); 3) interaction of bevacizumab treatment with chemotherapy backbone; 4) 
CEA level (abnormal vs. normal); 5) interaction of CEA with bevacizumab treatment;  6) previous 
adjuvant treatment (no previous adjuvant treatment, start of previous adjuvant treatment more than 900 
days before date of randomization, start of previous adjuvant treatment less or equal than 900 days 
before date of randomization); 7) interaction of previous adjuvant treatment with bevacizumab 
treatment.  
In order to further explore and reassess the dose of bevacizumab in mCRC, the MAH will present the 
efficacy data from on going trials,  that will provide information from approximately 750 patients with 
mCRC treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/wk equivalent in second line, and to compare 
the data from these studies with the data from study E3200 (bevacizumab 5 mg/kg/wk equivalent).  
The MAH also committed to provide the data from a prospective biomarker program implemented in 
the Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study, , investigating use of bevacizumab in 
the gastric cancer indication. The study , which started to recruit in September 2007, will compare the 
efficacy and safety of bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg/wk equivalent/versus placebo in combination with 
capecitabine and cisplatin in 760 patients. A comprehensive biomarker program was incorporated into 
this study to prospectively elucidate the association of the VEGF-, neuropilin- and EGF-receptor 
family in gastric cancer patients.  
Bevacizumab doses will be further evaluated after the results are available for the clinical NSCLC 
study and in a mBC study. The latter study compares the 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/wk equivalent dose with 
placebo and, if both bevacizumab arms are significantly active vs. placebo, an exploratory comparison 
between the two doses will also be made. 
The MAH will also provide the data from a retrospective analysis in more than 400 samples obtained 
from the NO16966 trial in mCRC indication.

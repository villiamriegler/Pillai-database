Brief description of the product
Deucravacitinib  is  a  small  molecule  that  selectively  inhibits  the 
TYK2  enzyme.  Deucravacitinib  binds  to  the  regulatory  domain  of 
TYK2,  stabilizing  an  inhibitory  interaction  between  the regulatory 
and  the  catalytic  domains  of  the  enzyme.  This  results  in  allosteric 
inhibition  of  receptor-mediated  activation  of  TYK2  and  its 
downstream functions in cells. TYK2 mediates signalling of (IL-23, 
IL-12,  and  type  I  IFN,  which  are  naturally  occurring  cytokines 
involved  in  inflammatory  and  immune  responses.  Deucravacitinib 
inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Epidemiologic Characteristics of Psoriasis
Psoriasis
Incidence 
Prevalence
Demographics of the 
population: age, gender, 
racial and/or ethnic origin 
Bell et al., using the Rochester Epidemiology Project database in the US, reported an 
overall  incidence  of  psoriasis  of  59.9/100,000 p-y  (95% CI: 49.5-70.3). 1 Two 
European studies used data from primary-care databases and reported incidences of 
120-130/100,000 p-y (the Netherlands)2 and 140/100,000 p-y (UK).3
According  to  current  studies,  more  than  8 million US Americans  have  psoriasis. 
125 million  people  worldwide-2 to 3 percent  of  the  total  population-have  psoriasis, 
according  to  the  World  Psoriasis  Day  consortium. 4 , 5 The  most  common  form 
(58-97% of cases)  is  plaque  psoriasis.6 Nearly  one-quarter  of  people  with  psoriasis 
have cases that are considered moderate to severe.
Although psoriasis occurs worldwide, its prevalence varies. Psoriasis is estimated to 
affect about 2-4% of the population in western countries.7,8,9 Important factors in the 
variation of the prevalence of psoriasis include age, gender, geography, and ethnicity, 
probably due to genetic and environmental factors. Higher prevalence rates have been 
reported at higher latitudes, and in Caucasians compared with other ethnic groups.10
The North-East and South Europe reported higher values than the UK, specifically of 
3.73% (95% CI: 3.13-4.32) in Denmark,11 4.82% (95% CI: 4.47-5.17)12 and 8.50% 
(95%  CI:  8.03–8.97)  in  Norway, 13 3.10%  (95%  CI:  2.54-3.66)  in  Italy, 14 and 
5.20% (95% CI: 4.68-5.72) in France.15 Although it can present at any age, studies 
have  observed  a  bimodal  distribution  of  adult-onset  psoriasis  with  the  first  peak 
ranging  from  20-30 years  of  age  and  the  second  peak ranging  from  55-60 years  of 
age.16 Early Onset Psoriasis (Type I) occurs prior to age 40 and accounts for more 
than 75% of cases.45
The prevalence of psoriasis is considered to be balanced between the sexes; however, 
some studies have indicated sex differences in the treatment of psoriasis.8 In a study 
spanning  three  decades  (1970-2000),  overall  age-adjusted  incidence  has  been 
observed to be higher in males (85.5 per 100,000; 95% CI: 79.5, 91.6) than in females 
(73.2  per  100,000;  95%  CI:  68.0,  78.4;  p=0.003).  However,  age  and  sex-specific 
annual incidence in females was highest in the sixth decade of life (90.7 per 100,000) 
whereas  among  men,  a  peak  incidence  was  observed  in  the  seventh  decade  of  life
(115.3 per 100,000).17
Risk factors for the 
disease 
The prevalence of psoriasis varies with the country, and psoriasis can appear at any 
age, suggesting that ethnicity, genetic background, and environmental factors affect

the  onset  of  psoriasis.  Extrinsic  risk  factors  such  as  injuries,  air  pollution,  sun 
exposure,  alcohol,  drugs,  vaccination,  and  infection  (e.g.:  strep  throat)  have  been 
associated with the development of psoriasis. Intrinsic risk factors can include obesity, 
metabolic  syndrome,  mental  stress,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  hypertension.18 Genetic 
factors play a significant role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. PSORS1, which lies 
within an approximately 220 kb segment of the major histocompatibility complex on 
chromosome 6p21, is a major susceptibility locus for psoriasis.19,20,21 HLA-Cw6 is 
the susceptibility allele within PSORS1;22 it is associated with early onset and severe 
and unstable disease.27,23 In genetically predisposed individuals, various triggering 
factors  can  elicit  the  disease.  In  past  surveys  from  1982  to  2012,  the  exacerbating 
factors  for  the  Japanese  population  were  observed  to  be  stress  (6.4%  to  16.6%), 
seasonal factors (9.7% to 13.3%), infection (3.5% to 8.3%), sun exposure (1.3% to 
3.5%),  and  β-blockers  (0.9%  to  2.3%).24,25,26 Metabolic  syndrome  is  common  in 
patients  with  psoriasis  and  obesity  is  strongly  associated  with  the  onset  and 
exacerbation  of  psoriasis. 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 Patients  with psoriasis  have  a 
significantly higher prevalence of obesity as well as a higher risk of obesity.34,35,36
In a meta-analysis, patients with psoriasis showed greater prevalence and incidence 
of  hypertension. 37 This  meta-analysis  also  revealed  that  severe  psoriasis  was 
associated  with greater  incidence  of  hypertension.  Patients with  psoriasis  appear  to 
have  more  severe  hypertension.  Patients  with  CD have  a  7-times  higher  risk  of 
developing psoriasis, and psoriasis patients have a 2.9-times higher risk of developing 
CD, when compared with the general population.38  
Mild  to  moderate  psoriasis  can  be  treated  topically  with  a  combination  of 
glucocorticoids, vitamin D analogues, and phototherapy. Moderate to severe psoriasis 
often  requires  systemic  treatment.  The  presence  of  comorbidities  such  as  psoriatic
arthritis  is  also  highly  relevant  in  treatment  selection.  Severe  psoriasis  requires 
phototherapy  or  systemic  therapies  such  as  retinoids,  methotrexate,  cyclosporine, 
apremilast,  or  biologic  immune  modifying  agents.  Biologic  agents  used  in  the 
treatment  of  psoriasis  include  the  anti-TNF  agents  adalimumab,  etanercept, 
infliximab, and certolizumab pegol; the anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody ustekinumab; the 
anti-IL-23A  antibodies  risankizumab  and  guselkumab;  the  anti-IL-17  antibodies 
secukinumab and ixekizumab; the anti-IL-17 receptor antibody brodalumab; and the 
anti-IL-23/IL-39 antibody tildrakizumab.
Severe psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of death from a variety of causes 
with  cardiovascular  death  being  the  most  common  etiology.39 These  patients  were 
also at increased risk of death from infection, kidney disease, and dementia. Patients 
with  severe  psoriasis  were  at  increased  risk  of  death  from  cardiovascular  disease 
(HR = 1.57;  95% CI: 1.26,  1.96),  malignancies  (HR = 1.41;  95% CI: 1.07,  1.86), 
chronic  lower  respiratory  disease  (HR = 2.08;  95% CI: 1.24-3.48),  diabetes 
(HR = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.08, 7.59), dementia (HR = 3.64; 95% CI: 1.36, 9.72), infection 
(HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.18), kidney disease (HR = 4.37; 95% CI: 2.24, 8.53), and 
unknown/missing causes (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.88).44 The absolute and excess 
risk of death was highest for cardiovascular disease (61.9 and 3.5 deaths per 1000 p-y,
respectively).44

Patients  with  severe  psoriasis  are  also  shown  to  be  at  increased  risk  of 
thromboembolic events (aHR = 1.26 [95% CI 1.07, 1.47], p = 0.005).40 Patients with 
psoriasis  have  a  slightly  elevated  baseline  risk  of malignancies,  in  particular 
lymphoproliferative  diseases.  Compared to  patients  without  psoriasis,  patients  with 
psoriasis had  increased risk  for all  cancers  excluding  NMSC  (aHR = 1.06,  95%  CI 
1.02, 1.09) and for lymphoma (aHR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.18, 1.51).41 Results from two 
separate  meta-analyses  also  demonstrated  patients  with psoriasis had higher risk  of 
malignancy compared to non-psoriasis patients, particularly keratinocyte cancer and 
lymphomas.42,43
In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the incidence rate for lymphoma was 
0.35  per  1,000  p-y,  0.58 per  1,000  p-y for  lung  cancer,  and  3.53  per  1,000  p-y for 
NMSC. Compared to patients without psoriasis, moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients 
demonstrated a strong association for lymphoma (aHR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.80), 
for  lung  cancer  (aHR = 1.60,  95% CI: 1.14,  2.24),  and  for  NMSC  (aHR = 1.61, 
95% CI: 1.42, 1.84).41
In the literature, the incidence rate of serious infections in the psoriasis population is 
higher compared to the general population. In a study conducted using the national 
Inpatient  Sample  from  2002-2012,  which  represents  a  20%  sample  of  all 
hospitalizations  in  the  US,  including 187,246 patients  with psoriasis,  psoriasis  was 
found to be associated with serious infections (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.32). The 
strongest associations were observed for cellulitis (OR = 3.21, 95% CI: 3.12, 3.30), 
herpes  simplex  virus  (OR = 2.21,  95% CI: 1.70, 2.89),  and  fungal  infections 
(OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.96, 2.09).40
In a recent study by Takeshita et al in 2018,44 risk of herpes zoster in 12,442 patients 
with  moderate-to-severe  psoriasis  was  compared  with  954,315  randomly  selected 
patients without psoriasis in a large UK primary care medical record database. Patients 
with  psoriasis  had  a  higher  incidence  of  serious  infection  than  patients  without 
psoriasis;  the  incidence  rate  for  herpes  zoster  was  highest  among  patients  with 
moderate to severe disease (incidence rate = 6.47 per 1000 p-y, 95% CI: 5.88, 7.11). 
Compared to those without psoriasis, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis had 
higher risk of herpes zoster infection (aHR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.30).
Comorbidities  classically  associated  with  psoriasis  are  psoriatic  arthritis,  CD, 
psychological/psychiatric disorders.45,46,47 In recent years, the metabolic syndrome 
as a whole and its individual components have been associated with psoriasis. Gelfand 
et  al. considered psoriasis  as  an  independent  factor  of  cardiovascular  risk 
aggravation.48
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, often progressive, inflammatory arthropathy that can 
lead to permanent joint damage and severe disability. Psoriatic arthritis is a common 
comorbidity among patients with psoriasis, affecting 6% to 10% of psoriasis patients 
overall and 20% to 40% of psoriasis patients with more extensive skin involvement.49
Binus et al. reported that patients with psoriasis and concomitant inflammatory bowel 
disease have a higher rate of comorbidities (seronegative arthritis, thyroiditis, diabetes 
and  lymphoma)  than  patients  with  psoriasis  only,  which  could  be  explained  by 
common inflammatory pathways and shared genetic risks.38
Psoriasis is associated with low self-esteem and prevalence of anxiety and depressive 
disorders  (30%  and  60%,  respectively). 50 , 51 , 52 Recently,  a  high  prevalence  of

alexithymia  was  observed.  About  10%  of  patients  with  psoriasis  consider  the 
possibility of suicide. Recent data shows that depression and anxiety are mainly found 
in women with family problems.53
2.2
Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification
The scope and results of the nonclinical toxicity studies support the clinical use of deucravacitinib
at  the  RHD  in  human  subjects  with  moderate-to-severe  psoriasis.  Deucravacitinib is 
pharmacologically active in rats and monkeys and was tolerated following once daily oral dosing
for up to 6 months  in rats and 9 months  in  monkeys. Deucravacitinib was not carcinogenic  in a 
6-month study in rasH2 transgenic mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (185× RHD AUC) or a 2-year 
study in rats at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (51× RHD AUC). In addition, there was no evidence of 
lymphoproliferative  disorders  or  malignancies  in  the  9-month  toxicity  study  in  monkeys 
(65× RHD AUC).
The  lymphoid/immune,  hematopoietic,  and  skin  were  identified  as  the  main  target  organs  of 
toxicity, with the following principal effects in the chronic rat and monkey toxicology studies: 
1)
In rats, several immunomodulatory effects were noted at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg (≥ 9× RHD AUC), 
including decreased blood lymphocytes and lymphoid cellularity  in  lymph nodes, decreased 
spleen and weights, decreased lymphoid cellularity of the splenic white pulp, and decreased 
T-cell-dependent  antibody  (IgM  and  IgG)  response  (TDAR)  to  KLH.  Decreased  TDAR  to 
KLH  was  also  noted  in  monkeys  at  ≥  1  mg/kg  (≥  7×  RHD  AUC)  without  decreased blood 
lymphocytes or microscopic changes in lymphoid tissues. 
2) Decreased RBC mass parameters (count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) and platelets in rats at 
≥ 15 mg/kg (≥ 42× RHD AUC) and monkeys at ≥ 1 mg/kg (≥ 7× RHD AUC).
3) Various skin changes (swollen, dry, lesion, flaking, papule, red, white, scab) throughout the 
body  in  monkeys were  noted at  doses  ≥  1  mg/kg  (≥  7×  RHD  AUC).  Skin  findings  in  most 
monkeys  did  not  require  veterinary  treatments;  others  were  treated  with  antibiotics,  and/or 
antiseptic agents. The skin findings generally improved clinically after start of the veterinary 
treatments and did not result in any preterminal deaths or unscheduled euthanasia. 
The  above  findings  were  fully  or  partially  reversible following  discontinuation  of  drug 
administration. 
In the pivotal embryo-fetal development studies in rats at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (266× RHD 
AUC) and rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (total/free 91×/20× RHD AUC, respectively), there 
was no evidence of teratogenicity or effects on embryo-fetal development. Deucravacitinib had no 
effects  on  male  rat  reproductive  parameters or  early  embryonic  development of  litters  sired  by 
deucravacitinib-treated  males  at  doses  up  to  50  mg/kg/day  (247×  RHD  AUC).  In  a  female  rat 
fertility study, there were no deucravacitinib-related effects on mating and fertility parameters at 
doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (171× RHD AUC). In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, 
deucravacitinib  administered  at  doses  up to  50  mg/kg/day  was  well  tolerated  with  no  maternal

toxicity. Deucravacitinib was associated with transient adverse effects on pup body weight in the 
preweaning  period  at  50  mg/kg/day,  which  recovered  postweaning.  Based  on  these  results,  the 
maternal NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day (110× RHD AUC) and the developmental 
NOAEL was considered to be 15 mg/kg/day (19× RHD AUC).
The results of these evaluations support the long-term safety of deucravacitinib in humans. Safety 
specifications for the principal nonclinical findings are summarized in Table 2.2-1. A summary of
nonclinical safety is provided in Appendix 2.
Table 2.2-1:
Summary of Significant Nonclinical Safety Findings
Key Safety Findings
Relevance to human usage
Skin  findings  (eg, folliculitis,  acne,  or  acneiform 
dermatitis) were observed in clinical studies in healthy 
subjects and infrequently in patients with moderate-to-
severe plaque psoriasis. The skin findings were mild or 
moderate  in  severity,  reversible,  and  rarely  led  to 
discontinuation of study treatment. Based on the nature 
of  the  events  observed,  the  skin  findings  are  not 
anticipated  to  impact  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the 
product  or  have 
implications  for  public  health; 
therefore,  they  are not  classified  as  an important risk 
for deucravacitinib. 
Based  on  the  available  data  from  the  deucravacitinib
Phase  1  to  3  studies,  there  is  no  clinical  evidence  to 
suggest  that  deucravacitinib  alters  RBC  or  platelet 
counts.
To  date, no  vaccination  studies  in humans have  been 
completed with deucravacitinib.
Skin Findings 
A variety of skin findings (swollen, dry, lesion, flaking, 
papule,  red,  white,  scab)  located  throughout  the  body 
were  noted  in  the  chronic  monkey study at  doses  ≥  7× 
RHD  AUC.  The  skin  changes  were  monitorable  and

Decreased RBC Mass Parameters and Platelets
Decreased  RBC  mass  parameters  (count,  hemoglobin, 
and hematocrit) and platelets were noted in rats at doses 
≥ 42× RHD AUC, and monkeys at doses ≥ 7× RHD AUC. 
These changes were monitorable and reversible.
Decreased TDAR to KLH Immunization
Decreased  TDAR  (IgM  and  IgG)  to immunization  with 
KLH  in rats  at  doses  ≥  9×  RHD  AUC,  and  monkeys  at 
doses ≥ 7× RHD AUC. Decreased TDAR responses are 
consistent  with  the  contributions  of  Type  I  IFNs  and 
IL-12/23  to  the  antigen-induced  antibody  responses. 
However,  although  diminished,  the  KLH-induced  IgM 
and IgG antibody responses were still evident, indicating 
that responses to the primary or recall responses were still 
maintained in rats and monkeys, and were fully reversible 
during post-dose recovery in rats.

Exposure to deucravacitinib is derived from the key Phase 3 studies (IM011046, IM011047, and 
IM011075) in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The Controlled Safety Pool comprises the 2 pivotal, 
Phase 3 studies (IM011046 and IM011047) which evaluated the use of deucravacitinib  in adult 
subjects  with  moderate-to-severe  plaque  psoriasis  who  were  candidates  for  phototherapy  or 
systemic  therapy.  Both  studies  had  similar  designs  (identical  up  to  Week  24),  with  the  same 
comparators, identical eligibility criteria, the same co-primary endpoints, and many of the same 
secondary  endpoints.  Both  studies  were  double-blind  and  placebo-controlled  through  Week 16, 
apremilast-controlled  through  Week 24,  and  were  52 weeks  in  treatment  duration.  The  Phase 3 
Safety  Pool comprises  the  two  pivotal  Phase  3  psoriasis  studies  and  long-term  safety  data  in 
subjects from these two studies enrolled  in the long-term extension study (IM011075) as of the 
safety cutoff date. Subjects were eligible regardless of assigned treatment in the pivotal Phase 3 
studies and may have received deucravacitinib, placebo, and/or apremilast as per protocol.
The exposure tables are as follows:

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programs 
The clinical development program for deucravacitinib is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse 
reactions such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by 
prolonged  or  cumulative  exposure.  Post-marketing  safety  monitoring  and  epidemiology  studies 
will support the identification of these reactions.

Post-Authorization Experience
Deucravacitinib was  first  approved  on 09-Sep-2022  in  the  US  for  the  treatment  of 
moderate-to-severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  who  are  candidates  for  systemic  therapy  or 
phototherapy. 
Based  on  PV activities  conducted  by  BMS,  postmarketing  safety  data  are  consistent  with the 
established deucravacitinib clinical trial safety data. Due to the short time after the first approval 
worldwide, no post-authorisation exposure estimates are available.
26
EU Risk Management Plan

Version 2.0
Deucravacitinib 
Deucravacitinib postmarketing data are subject to continued PV monitoring and reporting as per 
applicable  safety  reporting  requirements.  Continuous  safety  monitoring  ensures  that  updated 
safety information is available in a timely manner and that any future changes to the benefit-risk 
profile of deucravacitinib are appropriately managed and reported. 
2.5.1
Post-authorisation Exposure
2.5.1.1
Method Used to Calculate Exposure
There  is  no  readily  available  information  on  the  number  of  patients  treated  with  marketed 
deucravacitinib;  however,  an  estimate  of  patient  exposure  can  be  derived  from  available sales 
figures and free goods and samples dispensed. For samples, the total number of packs dispensed 
is not recorded, only the number of patients who received them. Therefore, the amount dispensed 
assumes the minimum of one 30 count pack/patient of 6 mg tablets.
Internal sales, free goods, and sample figures are available for the cumulative and interval periods. 
Sales/shipment/dispensation  data  consist  of  all  shipments  of  the  Company’s  product  to  all 
applicable countries and  includes commercial and free-of-charge units (as applicable). The data 
are  used  to  determine  the  units  (eg,  milligram)  of  a  product  sold/dispensed  to  a  geography  to 
estimate the number of person-years of exposure. For deucravacitinib, a daily dose of 6 mg was 
used  for  exposure  calculations,  as  it  is  assumed  that  one  6 mg  tablet  per  day  is  taken  during 
treatment, per the currently approved psoriasis indication. 
2.5.1.2
Exposure
Patient exposure can be estimated based on sales data and free goods and samples dispensed and 
the assumptions described. An estimated 12,040,248 mg were sold/dispensed from 09-Sep-2022 
through 08-Sep-2023. The cumulative exposure is estimated to be:
(12,040,248 mg ÷ 6 mg/day) ÷ 365.25 days/year = 5494 person-years.
This  estimate  of  the  number  of  person-years  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  given  the 
limitations of the available sales/dispensation data.

2.6.1
Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
Deucravacitinib  does  not  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier,  does  not  elicit  central  nervous 
system activity, and  has a  low risk of abuse  liability/drug dependence. In the clinical studies of 
psoriasis, there were no clinical features of mu or kappa receptor agonism (eg, euphoria, dysphoria, 
lethargy, persistent sedation) and no withdrawal symptoms typical of drugs with abuse potential 
in the 30-day follow-up period after stopping deucravacitinib.54

VTE (DVT/PE)
Deucravacitinib  may  increase  the  risk  of  serious  infections.  In  the  2 
pivotal, controlled, Phase 3 psoriasis studies (IM011046 and IM011047), 
pneumonia was  the most  common  serious  infection in  deucravacitinib-
treated subjects.
The potential role of deucravacitinib in the development of malignancies

Potential mechanisms  Deucravacitinib is  associated  with  specific  cytokine  receptors  and  catalyzes  the 
phosphorylation of STAT proteins downstream of these receptors including the receptors 
for p40-containing cytokines, IL-12, and IL-23, as well as IFN receptor. P40-containing 
cytokines are involved in epithelial immune defense, such as activation of immune cells. 
Type 1 interferons play a critical role in immune responses to viruses. Therefore, based on 
its mechanism of action, deucravacitinib may increase the risk of serious infections.

Characterization of 
Risk
Deucravacitinib has the  potential  to  increase  the risk of  serious  infections,  based  on its 
mechanism of action of selective TYK2 inhibition. Although serious infections have been
reported  in  patients  treated  with  deucravacitinib in  clinical  trials,  available  cumulative 
information does not suggest an increased risk of serious infection in patients treated with 
deucravacitinib.
Controlled Safety Pool 
During Week 0-16 in the Controlled Safety Pool (Studies IM011046 and IM011047), the 
overall  incidence  of  infections  (SOC infections  and  infestations)  was  higher  in  the 
deucravacitinib  group  (29.1%)  than  the  placebo  (21.5%)  and  apremilast  (22%)  groups; 
however, the incidence of serious infection was low and similar across treatment groups 
(deucravacitinib:  0.6%,  placebo:  0.5%,  apremilast:  0.5%).  The  majority  of 
infection-related AEs were of the upper respiratory tract. The majority  of the infections 
were mild or moderate in severity.

The  infection  SAEs  with  deucravacitinib  included  diverticulitis,  pyelonephritis,  sepsis, 
streptococcal bacteremia, and upper respiratory tract infection. One of these cases (sepsis) 
was  fatal:  a  75-year-old  white  female  with  hypertension,  history  of  cerebrovascular 
accident, pacemaker placement, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity was discontinued from 
treatment  with  deucravacitinib  on  Day 4  due  to  a  prohibited  concomitant  medication 
(leflunomide). The subject was hospitalized on Day 12 after multiple episodes of cardiac 
arrest with resuscitation and died the following day. A family member reported that death 
was due to heart failure and sepsis (medical records not provided).
The incidence of infection-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was low and 
similar across the treatment groups; the infections leading to treatment discontinuation in 
the deucravacitinib group were folliculitis and pneumonia.
There  were  7  subjects  with  influenza  AEs  (deucravacitinib  0.5%;  placebo  0.7%; 
apremilast 0%);  none  of  these  AEs  was  confirmed  to  be  influenza  by  the  Infection 
Adjudication Committee. 
The frequency of herpes zoster was low and similar between the deucravacitinib (0.2%; 
0.8/100 p-y) and placebo groups (0.2%; 0.8/100 p-y), and there were no reports of herpes 
zoster in the apremilast group. None of these events was serious, disseminated or led to 
discontinuation, and all resolved with usual medical care. 
There  were  no  reports  of  TB  in  any  treatment  group.  There  were  no  opportunistic 
infections  in  the  deucravacitinib  or  placebo  groups;  there  was  1  subject  with  an  AE  of 
blastocystis infection in the apremilast group that was not confirmed to be an opportunistic 
infection by the Infection Adjudication Committee.

to  treatment  discontinuation.  A  total  of  52 subjects  had  a  serious  infection  related  to 
COVID-19,  including  7 fatal  cases.  The  majority  of  subjects  with  an  SAE  related  to 
COVID-19, including all deaths, had risk factors for severe COVID-19, such as elderly 
age, obesity, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and lung disease. The long-term 
extension study (IM011075) coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.
As described above, there was a death due to heart failure and sepsis during Week 0-16 
and 7 deaths due to COVID-19. There were no additional deaths with deucravacitinib for 
which the cause was infection. 
Infections  leading  to  discontinuation  of  deucravacitinib  included  COVID-19  (6), 
COVID-19  pneumonia,  folliculitis,  pneumonia,  postoperative  wound  infection,  and

A total of 33 subjects who were treated with deucravacitinib had an influenza-related AE; 
17 subjects (0.5/100 p-y) had an event that was confirmed to be influenza by the Infection 
Adjudication Committee.
There were 20 subjects with a herpes zoster event (0.6/100 p-y). The risk of herpes zoster 
did not increase with increasing treatment duration of deucravacitinib. None of the herpes 
zoster cases were serious, systemic, or led to treatment discontinuation. 
There  were  no  serious  or  systemic  opportunistic  infections  in  subjects  who  received 
deucravacitinib. There was 1 report of opportunistic infection: a non-serious AE of CMV 
infection of the gastrointestinal tract of moderate severity that did not result in treatment 
discontinuation. The Infection Adjudication Committee assessed that it was a case of CMV 
primary infection in an immunocompetent host. One case of active TB has been reported 
in the Phase 3 Safety Pool as of the data cutoff date. A subject 
 in the long-
term extension study (IM011075) had a positive IGRA (protocol manda ed) on Day 380 
of the study and was found to have an infiltrate in the right upper lobe of the lung consistent 
with  TB  on  CT  scan.  The  subject  did  not  exhibit  symptoms  of  TB,  and  the  event was 
considered to be of moderate severity and not related to study treatment by the investigator.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
Preventability
Psoriasis has been shown to increase the risk of serious infection. Other risk factors for the 
development  of  serious  infection  include  clinically  significant metabolic  and  endocrine 
disorders such as diabetes, obesity, thyroid disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and renal 
and hepatic disorders; advanced age; and the concomitant use of corticosteroids and other 
immunosuppressants.
Most  infections  can  be  easily  recognized  and  managed  by  appropriate  diagnostic 
procedures, dose interruption and treatment. Infections can be minimized by appropriate 
patient selection by considering factors such as previous history of infections, assessment 
of  risks  for  chronic  or  latent  infections,  and  age.  Prior  to  initiating  treatment  with 
deucravacitinib, patients should be evaluated for TB infection. Deucravacitinib should not 
be administered to subjects who have evidence of a clinically important active infection or 
active TB. Additional information is provided in the SmPC.
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product 
In clinical studies of deucravacitinib, the incidence of serious infection was low and similar 
to  placebo.  There  is  no  increased  risk  of  serious  infection  when  treatment  duration  of 
deucravacitinib  is  increased.  Influenza,  herpes  zoster,  TB  and  opportunistic  infections 
were infrequent and all non-serious. With early recognition and appropriate management
of infections, the benefits of deucravacitinib outweigh the potential risk.
Public health impact 
Serious  infections have  been  infrequent  in  patients receiving  deucravacitinib.  With risk 
minimization by labeling, and early recognition and appropriate management, the public 
health impact on the psoriasis population is low.

Important Potential Risk: Malignancies
Potential mechanisms  Deucravacitinib may affect the risk of malignancies, given its immunomodulatory nature.
Drugs  that  are  immunomodulators  may  diminish  immune  surveillance  and  thereby 
increase the risk for development of malignancies. Mechanistic studies to evaluate the role 
of TYK2 in malignancies are inconclusive.
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence
As  with  any  modulator  of  the  immune  system,  there  is  a  theoretical  risk  of  increased 
malignancy with deucravacitinib. Although malignancies have  been reported in patients 
treated with deucravacitinib in clinical trials, available cumulative information does not 
suggest an increased risk of malignancy in patients treated with deucravacitinib.

One of the malignancies was fatal (hepatocellular carcinoma). 
Three  cases  of  lymphoma  were  observed  in  the  Phase  3  Safety  Pool:  1  Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma in  Study  IM011046  and  2  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphomas (1  B-cell  lymphoma 
[follicular  lymphoma] and  1  nodal  marginal  zone  B-cell  lymphoma) in  the  open-label, 
long-term extension study (IM011075). In addition, 1 case of Hodgkin’s lymphoma was 
reported  in  a  subject  with  erythrodermic  psoriasis  in  a  single-arm,  open-label  regional 
study in Japan (IM011066).56 BMS concluded that a causal association of deucravacitinib 
with the reported cases of lymphoma has not been demonstrated and factors in each of the 
cases also suggest non-deucravacitinib related causes. While it is not possible to rule out 
an association, a causal link to deucravacitinib was not established in any of the reported 
cases.  For  the  2 cases  of  Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  while  a  highly  immunosuppressive 
regimen in the transplant setting is associated with EBV-positive Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 
the  targeted  immunomodulation  conferred  by  deucravacitinib  is  intermittent and  partial 
(approximately  50%)  over  a  24-hour  period  and  not  analogous 
to  highly 
immunosuppressive  regimens  used  in  the  transplant  setting  where  outgrowth  of  EBV-
positive B cell malignancies is observed.  Marginal zone B cell lymphoma and follicular 
lymphoma are not commonly associated with immunosuppression. The subject who was 
reported to have follicular lymphoma had a heavy smoking history (20 cigarettes/day for 
over 36 years), which is a known risk factor for follicular lymphoma.57,58
Among the subjects with solid malignancies, there was no preponderance of any one type 
and the majority of subjects had risk factors for malignancy, such as older age, previous 
melanoma,  family  history,  smoking history,  exposure  to agents  known  to  be  associated 
with increased risk of cancer (eg, biologic therapy), and hepatitis C with cirrhosis (in the 
subject with hepatocellular carcinoma).
Of the 14 subjects who experienced an NMSC in the Phase 3 Safety Pool, 9 had a medical 
history  of  NMSC.  Other  reported  risk  factors  included  actinic  keratosis,  older  age, 
Fitzpatrick Skin Type 1 or 2, phototherapy with ultraviolet A light, and prior TNF inhibitor 
use.
Phase 2 Data
In the Phase 2 study in psoriasis (IM011011),55 1 malignant melanoma in situ (Grade 0) 
was  diagnosed  on  skin  biopsy  of  an  atypical  nevus  in  a  subject  who  received 
deucravacitinib 3 mg QD.
Patients with psoriasis have a slightly elevated baseline risk of malignancies, in particular 
lymphoproliferative  diseases.  Among  patients  with  psoriasis,  an  increased  risk  of  solid 
cancers appears to be related to alcohol use and cigarette smoking. In addition, exposure 
to  PUVA  radiation  and  immunosuppressants  (including  cyclosporin  and  possibly 
methotrexate)  has  been  associated  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  in  psoriasis  patients. 
General  risk  factors  for  malignancy  include  increasing  age,  lifestyle  factors  (such  as

Preventability
Measures to prevent specific malignancies (eg, smoking cessation, sun precautions) should
be recommended as part of standard medical care.
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product 
Malignancies can be associated with a fatal outcome. Based on the mechanism of action 
of deucravacitinib, it may affect host defenses against malignancies. Mechanistic studies 
to  evaluate  the  role  of  TYK2  in  malignancies  are  inconclusive.  Based  on  the  available 
clinical  data  and the relevant  epidemiology  for  malignancy  and  specifically  lymphoma, 
there does not appear to be a clear association with deucravacitinib exposure. The benefits 
of deucravacitinib outweigh the potential risk of malignancies.
Public health impact 
The incidence of malignancies in clinical trials of deucravacitinib has been low. There is 
no public health impact outside of the treated patient population.

Potential mechanisms  Based on the hypothesis that inflammatory cytokines contribute to CV events, blocking 
cytokines  that  are  regulated  by  TYK2  (ie,  IL-12  and  IL-23) would  not  be  expected  to 
increase the risk of MACE. 
It is not known whether TYK2 inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential 
adverse  reactions  of  JAK  inhibition.  Higher  rates  of  MACE  were  observed  in  patients 
treated with a JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers in RA patients 
50 years of age and older with at least one CV risk factor. 
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence
Evidence for an increased background risk of MACE in patients with psoriasis is cited in 
the  published  literature.  Although  MACE  were  reported  in  subjects treated  with 
deucravacitinib  in  clinical  trials,  available  cumulative  information  does  not  indicate an 
increased risk of MACE in patients treated with deucravacitinib.

In the Phase 2 study in psoriasis (IM011011),55 there were no reports of MACE.
The  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  CV  disease  are  well  known  and  include 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, advanced age, male sex, obesity,

MACE compared  with the  general  population.59 Epidemiological  studies have  shown a 
higher prevalence of CV risk factors in psoriasis patients, including metabolic syndrome, 
smoking,  obesity,  hypertension,  diabetes,  insulin  resistance,  and  dyslipidemia. 60
Additionally,  literature  suggests  psoriasis  may  be  an independent risk  factor  due  to  the 
high inflammatory burden of psoriatic disease.61,62

Potential mechanisms  The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated in thrombosis. IL-12 is important in 
animal  models  of  thrombosis  and  loss  of  the  related  TH1  cells  accelerates  thrombus 
resolution.63,64 In addition, inhibition of IL-23 or IL-17A is protective in a mouse model 
of  psoriasis-related  thrombosis. 65 These  findings  suggest  that  TYK2  inhibition  by 
deucravacitinib, with consequent downstream inhibitory effects on IL-12 and IL-23, would 
not be predicted to be thrombogenic.
It is not known whether TYK2 inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential 
adverse reactions of JAK inhibition. Higher rates of DVT and PE were observed in patients 
treated with a JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers in RA patients

underlying  condition  and  other  risk  factors.  Although  VTE  were  reported  in  subjects
treated with deucravacitinib in clinical trials, available cumulative information does not 
indicate an increased risk  of  VTE in  patients  treated  with  deucravacitinib. The  subjects
who developed DVT/PE in clinical trials had recognized and well-established risk factors 
for thromboembolism.

Table 2.7.3.1-4:
Important Potential Risk: VTE (DVT/PE)
Important Potential Risk: VTE (DVT/PE)
During Week 0-16, there was 1 VTE, which was a DVT (non-serious) reported in a subject 
receiving  deucravacitinib.  During  Week  0-52,  there  were  2  VTE in  subjects receiving
deucravacitinib. In addition to the event during Week 0-16, 1 subject experienced a PE
(serious). There were no VTE reported with placebo or apremilast.
Phase 3 Safety Pool
Overall, in the Phase 3 Safety Pool (Studies IM011046, IM011047, and IM011075), which 
included 1,519 subjects who received deucravacitinib with 3,261 p-y of exposure, there 
were  a  total  of  3  events  of  VTE  (DVT/PE)  with  deucravacitinib,  resulting  in  an  IR  of 
0.1/100 p-y. In addition to the VTE in the Controlled Safety Pool, there was 1 DVT (non-
serious) in the LTE study.
All  events  of  VTE  occurred  in  subjects  with  relevant  medical  history,  concomitant 
medication use, and/or concurrent inciting factors that predispose to VTE.

The subject who had a DVT during Week 0-16 was a current smoker using estrogen-
containing  oral  contraceptives.  The  DVT was in  the  right  radial  vein,  where the 
subject had had IV cannulation for administration of antibiotics. Thrombus formation 
in the radial vein may be observed following IV cannulation. The event resolved, and 
the subject discontinued the study for unspecified personal reasons.
The subject who had a PE had a concurrent aortic dissection and other risk factors 
that  included,  in  addition  to  psoriasis,  hypertension,  obesity,  and  former  smoker.
Study treatment was temporarily interrupted. The subject subsequently enrolled into 
the LTE study, and continued in the study with no further VTE.
The subject who had a DVT in the LTE study was hospitalized with COVID-19 at 
the time of the DVT. COVID-19 has been associated with a high risk of VTE. This 
subject also had  other risk  factors  that  included,  in  addition  to  psoriasis,  morbid 
obesity,  hypertension,  and  former  smoker.  Study  treatment  was  temporarily 
interrupted. The subject continued in the LTE study with no further VTE.


All VTE were considered not related to study treatment by the investigator.
Phase 2 Data
In the Phase 2 study in psoriasis (IM011011),55 there were no reports of VTE.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
An  increased  risk  for  VTE  has  been  associated  with  a  history  of  VTE,  increasing  age, 
immobility,  obesity,  smoking,  hypertension,  estrogen-containing  oral  contraceptives, 
COPD, infections (including COVID-19), and chronic inflammatory conditions, including 
psoriasis.66,67,68,69,70
Preventability
Measures to prevent VTE (eg, control of modifiable risk factors) should be recommended 
as part of standard medical care.
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product 
VTE can be associated with a fatal outcome. Based on the available clinical data and the 
relevant  epidemiology  for  VTE,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  an association  with 
deucravacitinib exposure. The benefits of deucravacitinib outweigh the potential risk of 
VTE.
Public health impact 
The incidence of VTE in clinical trials of deucravacitinib has been low. There is no public 
health impact outside of the treated patient population.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for SOTYKTU (deucravacitinib)
This is a summary of the RMP for SOTYKTU. The RMP details important risks of SOTYKTU 
and how more information will be obtained about SOTYKTU's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
SOTYKTU's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC) and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how SOTYKTU should be used. 
This summary of the RMP  for SOTYKTU should be read in the context of all this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of SOTYKTU's 
RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
SOTYKTU is not yet authorized for use. It is given by film-coated tablet for oral administration 
in a strength of 6 mg of deucravacitnib. 
Further information about the evaluation of SOTYKTU’s benefits can be found in SOTYKTU’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of SOTYKTU, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about SOTYKTU's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use, in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
If important information that may affect the safe use of SOTYKTU is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.

II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  SOTYKTU are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of SOTYKTU. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing and  needs  to  be  collected  (eg,  on  the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Deucravacitinib
Deucravacitinib has the potential to increase the risk of serious 
infections, based on its mechanism of action of selective TYK2 
inhibition.  Although  serious  infections  have  been  reported  in 
patients treated with deucravacitinib in clinical trials, available 
cumulative  information  does  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  of 
serious infection in patients treated with deucravacitinib.
Psoriasis  has  been  shown  to  increase  the  risk  of  serious 
infection.  Other  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  serious 
infection include clinically significant metabolic and endocrine 
disorders  such  as  diabetes,  obesity, 
thyroid  disorders, 
cardiovascular  disorders,  and  renal  and  hepatic  disorders; 
advanced  age; and the  concomitant  use  of  corticosteroids  and 
other immunosuppressants.

As  with  any  modulator  of  the  immune  system,  there  is  a 
theoretical  risk  of  increased  malignancy  with  deucravacitinib. 
Although malignancies  have  been  reported  in  patients  treated 
with  deucravacitinib  in  clinical  trials,  available  cumulative 
information does not suggest an increased risk of malignancy in 
patients treated with deucravacitinib.
in  particular 
Patients with psoriasis have a slightly elevated baseline risk of 
malignancies, 
lymphoproliferative  diseases. 
Among patients with psoriasis, an increased risk of solid cancers 
appears  to  be related to  alcohol  use and  cigarette  smoking. In 
addition, exposure to PUVA radiation and immunosuppressants 
(including  cyclosporin  and  possibly  methotrexate)  has  been 
associated with squamous cell carcinoma in psoriasis patients. 
General  risk  factors  for  malignancy  include  increasing  age, 
lifestyle factors (such as alcohol and tobacco use and obesity), 
family history of cancer, and certain environmental exposures.

Evidence for an increased background risk of MACE in patients 
with  psoriasis  is  cited  in  the  published  literature.  Although 
MACE were reported in patients treated with deucravacitinib in 
clinical  trials,  available  cumulative  information  does  not 
indicate an  increased  risk  of  MACE  in  patients  treated  with 
deucravacitinib.
It  is  not  known  whether  TYK2  inhibition  may  be  associated 
with  the  observed  or  potential  adverse  reactions  of  JAK 
inhibition.  Higher  rates  of  MACE  were  observed  in  patients 
treated with a JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF 
blockers in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least 
one CV risk factor.
The  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  CV  disease  are  well 
known  and 
include  hypertension,  hypercholesterolemia, 
diabetes, smoking, advanced age, male sex, obesity, and family 
history.  Patients  with  psoriasis  have  been  shown  to  be  at 
increased risk for MACE compared with the general population. 
Epidemiological studies have shown a higher prevalence of CV 
risk factors in psoriasis patients, including metabolic syndrome, 
smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, insulin resistance, and 
dyslipidemia. Additionally, literature suggests psoriasis may be 
an independent risk factor due to the high inflammatory burden 
of psoriatic disease.

It is not known whether TYK2 inhibition may be associated 
with the observed or potential adverse reactions of JAK 
inhibition. Higher rates of DVT and PE were observed in 
patients treated with a JAK inhibitor compared to those treated 
with TNF blockers in RA patients 50 years of age and older 
with at least one CV risk factor.
An increased risk for VTE has been associated with a history 
of VTE, increasing age, immobility, obesity, smoking, 
hypertension, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, COPD, 
infections (including COVID-19), and chronic inflammatory 
conditions, including psoriasis.

study to characterize the long-term 
safety and efficacy of BMS-986165 in 
subjects with moderate-to-severe
plaque psoriasis (IM011075)
Rationale and study objectives
To  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  of  deucravacitinib  in  patients  with 
psoriasis in the real-world setting.
To evaluate the long-term safety of deucravacitinib; the trial will be of 
sufficient  size  and  duration  to  characterize  safety  events  of  interest, 
including  cardiovascular  adverse  events,  opportunistic  infections,  and 
malignancy.
To  assess  major  congenital  malformations,  spontaneous  abortions, 
stillbirths,  and  small  for  gestational  age  and  preterm  birth  in  women 
exposed to deucravacitinib during pregnancy compared to an unexposed 
control population.
To  characterize  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  long-term  use  of 
deucravacitinib in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

APPENDIX 2: NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SUMMARY 
A comprehensive battery of nonclinical studies, including in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology 
and  safety  pharmacology  assessments,  in  vitro  phototoxicity,  local  tolerance,  embryo-fetal 
development (EFD) in rats and rabbits, male and female fertility and early embryonic development 
in  rats,  pre-and  post-natal  development  (PPND)  in  rats,  developmental  study  in  juvenile  rats,
carcinogenicity  studies  in  rasH2  transgenic  mice  and  rats;  and  single- and/or  repeat-dose 
( 9 months) oral toxicity studies in mice, rats, dogs, and/or monkeys, were completed to assess 
the toxicologic profile of BMS-986165. All pivotal studies were conducted  in compliance with 
GLP  regulations  and  according  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Safety  pharmacology  assessments 
(cardiovascular  [CV],  neurologic,  and  respiratory  systems)  were  incorporated  in  select  toxicity 
studies in rats and monkeys, and single-dose CV telemetry studies were conducted in conscious 
rats, dogs, and monkeys. The rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main species for 
the  toxicologic  evaluation,  as  they  are  the  standard  models  for  toxicity  assessments  with  large 
historical databases; demonstrated comparable potency against TYK2 inhibition in whole blood 
of rats and  monkeys compared to humans, and also in ex  vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) activity 
assays  as  part  of  the  toxicology  studies,  and  comparable  metabolism  to  human.  Doses  that 
generated high systemic exposures were used to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the toxicity 
profile  of  BMS-986165  and  to  support  its  safe  use  in  human  subjects.  Based  on  the  studies 
conducted,  the  dose  ranges  used,  and  the  observed  effects,  the  nonclinical  toxicity  profile  of 
BMS-986165 was well characterized in the selected animal species. Systemic exposure multiples 
between  animal  species  used  in  toxicity studies  and  human  subjects  were  calculated  relative  to 
recommended human dose (RHD) of 6 mg once daily (mean steady-state Cmax 0.0451 µg/mL and 
AUC[0-24h] 0.473 µg•h/mL) in subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The two major human 
metabolites,  BMT-158170  and  BMT-153261,  are nongenotoxic,  have  favorable  pharmacologic 
profile with no noteworthy off-target effects at clinically relevant exposure, and were quantified 
in  the  toxicity  studies  at  plasma  levels,  which  provide  adequate  exposure  multiples  to  human 
exposure at the RHD. The totality of the toxicity assessments demonstrate that BMS-986165, at 
doses associated with robust PD effects, has a favorable dose-related safety profile in both rodents 
and  monkeys,  and  toxicological  findings,  which  are  either  fully  reversible  or  trending  toward 
the  principal
clinically  monitorable 
recovery,

summary  of 
Safety Pharmacology
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  safety  pharmacology  evaluation  of  the  cardiovascular  system,  and  in  vivo 
safety  pharmacology  evaluation  of  the  central  nervous  and  respiratory  systems  were  conducted 
within  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  and/or  dedicated  single-dose  safety  pharmacology 
studies. There were no BMS-986165-related CNS or respiratory effects in animals. BMS-986165 
did not exhibit off-target activity in a panel of receptors, ion channels, transporters or enzymes1
and  did  not  inhibit  cardiac  hERG/IKr  potassium,  SCN5A  sodium  or  L-type  calcium  channel 
currents2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transiently decreased blood pressure and increased 
heart  rate  were  seen  in  anesthetized  rabbits3,  and  conscious  telemetered  dogs4 and  monkeys5,6

(most sensitive species). In telemetered monkeys6, no hemodynamic effects were noted at a dose 
of  0.65  mg/kg  (3×  RHD),  and  transiently  increased  heart  rate  was  noted  at  1  mg/kg  (6×  RHD
Cmax).  However,  these  hemodynamic  effects  had  identifiable  thresholds  with  high  exposure 
margins  in  dogs  and  rabbits;  were  transient/reversible;  were  absent  in  the  repeat-dose 
(≤ 9 months)789 toxicity studies in monkeys at higher doses (≤ 10/5 mg/kg/day; 49× RHD Cmax)
or in telemetered rats; and were not associated with any macroscopic or microscopic findings in 
the monkey CV system. Overall, the totality of nonclinical data indicate that BMS-986165 has low 
potential for CV, CNS and respiratory effects or other off-target effects at the RHD. 
Single-Dose Toxicity Studies
Overall, BMS-986165 was well tolerated at high exposures and up to the highest oral single doses 
of 75, 100, and 30 mg/kg in rats10, dogs11, and monkeys12, respectively.  
Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies
In repeat dose oral toxicity studies in rats, BMS-986165 was tolerated at all doses (≤ 75 mg/kg/day 
for 1 month13; ≤ 15 mg/kg/day for 3 months14; and ≤ 50 mg/kg/day for 6 months15 [247× RHD
AUC]).  In  the  6-month  study,  consistent  with  pharmacologic  immunomodulation,  the  primary 
findings  at  ≥ 5  mg/kg/day  (≥  9×  RHD AUC)  were  decreased  blood  lymphocytes,  decreased 
lymphoid cellularity in lymph nodes and spleen, and/or suppression of T-cell-dependent antibody 
(IgM and IgG) response (TDAR) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) immunization. Additional 
findings considered adverse at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day (≥ 42× RHD AUC) included decreased mean body 
weights and body weight gains, decreased red blood cell (RBC) mass parameters, reticulocytes, 
platelets, and bone marrow cellularity. All BMS-986165-related changes were reversible except 
for the decreased food consumption body weights and spleen weights, and nonadverse increased 
incidence of macrophage aggregation in the lung. Based on the absence of adverse findings, the 
no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was considered to be 5 mg/kg/day (9× RHD AUC). 
In repeat-dose (≤ 3 months)7,8 oral toxicity studies in monkeys, BMS-986165 was tolerated at all 
doses (≤ 5 mg/kg/day). In the 9-month monkey toxicity study with a 2-month recovery9, the high 
dose of 10 mg/kg/day was reduced to 5 mg/kg/day (denoted as 10/5 mg/kg/day) due to poor clinical
tolerability. The main findings at all doses (≥ 1 mg/kg/day, ≥ 7× RHD AUC) included generally 
dose-dependent  skin  changes  (swollen,  dry,  lesion,  flaking,  papule,  red,  white,  scab)  located 
throughout  the  body.  Most  monkeys  did  not  require  any  veterinary  treatments for  the  skin 
observations; others were treated with Vaseline, antibiotics, topical chlorhexidine, and/or Epsom 
salts.  The  skin  findings  generally  improved  clinically  after  start of  the  veterinary  treatments. 
Additional  findings  at all  doses  included  transient  gastrointestinal  effects (eg,  diarrhea/loose 
feces), dose-dependent decreased RBC mass parameters, and suppression of TDAR to KLH, and 
at ≥ 3 mg/kg/day (≥ 33× RHD AUC) transiently decreased activity, hunched posture, pale gums, 
and  increased  body  temperature,  with  decreased  platelets  and  occult  blood in  urine  at 
10/5 mg/kg/day  (65×  RHD AUC).  Following  the  2-month  recovery,  all  BMS-986165-related 
findings  were  partially  or  fully  reversible.  The  NOAEL was  not  identified  due  to  adverse  skin 
findings at all doses (≥ 1 mg/kg/day; ≥ 7× RHD AUC).

BMS-986165
Genotoxicity
Deucravacitinib
BMS-986165  was  not  genotoxic  in  any  pivotal  mutagenicity 16 or  clastogenicity 17 studies. In 
addition, in a definitive in vivo micronucleus test as part of the 1-month toxicity study in rats13, 
BMS-986165 was not genotoxic at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (343× RHD Cmax).
Carcinogenicity
BMS-986165 was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in rasH2 mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day 
(185× RHD AUC) or a 2-year study in rats at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (51× RHD AUC).
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
In the pivotal EFD studies in rats at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (266× RHD AUC)18 and rabbits at 
doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (total/free-fraction 91×/20× RHD AUC, respectively)19, there was no 
evidence of teratogenicity or effects on embryo-fetal development. BMS-986165 had no effects 
on male rat reproductive parameters (mating, fertility, and sperm morphology), or early embryonic 
development of litters sired by BMS-986165-treated males up to the highest dose of 50 mg/kg/day 
(247×  RHD  AUC) conducted  as  part  of  the  6-month  toxicity  study15.  In  a  female  rat  fertility 
study20,  there  were  no  BMS-986165-related  effects  on  mating  and  fertility  parameters  up  to 
50 mg/kg/day, and the  maternal and reproductive NOAEL were considered to be 50 mg/kg/day 
(171× RHD AUC). In a PPND study in rats21, BMS-986165 dosed to pregnant/lactating dams at 
doses  up  to  50  mg/kg/day  was  well  tolerated  with  no  maternal  toxicity.  BMS-986165  was 
associated  with  transient  adverse  effects  on  pup  body  weight  in  the  preweaning  period  at 
50 mg/kg/day, which recovered postweaning. Based on these results, the maternal NOAEL was 
50 mg/kg/day (110× RHD AUC) and the developmental NOAEL was 15 mg/kg/day (19× RHD 
AUC).
Juvenile Toxicity
In a 10-week oral development toxicity study in juvenile rats with a 10-week postdose recovery 
period22, BMS-986165 was clinically well tolerated when dosed daily from post-natal day (PND) 
21 through PND 90 at doses ≤ 50 mg/kg/day. Most findings,  including effects on lymphocytes, 
spleen, and suppression of TDAR to KLH, were consistent with immunomodulatory activity, were 
reversible,  and  considered  nonadverse.  Notably,  the  changes  in  this  study  were  previously 
observed in adults rats at a similar magnitude, indicating that juvenile rats are not more sensitive 
nor demonstrate unique toxicity relative to findings in mature rats. Based on the absence of adverse 
findings, the NOAEL in juvenile rats was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day (125× RHD AUC).
Local Tolerance
BMS-986165 was not a skin sensitizer in mouse lymph node assays23,24. BMS-98165 was not a 
human skin irritant25, or ocular irritant26 in in vitro assays.
Phototoxicity
BMS-986165 was not cytotoxic or phototoxic in an in vitro 3T3 mouse fibroblast assay.27

- Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
remove the duplication of 'rash' from the list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency 
uncommon to align with a similar change previously 
accepted as part of the renewal procedure of Rolufta 
Ellipta. 
- To include significant changes to sections 2, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.5 of the SmPC, sections 
3, 4, 5, 7 and 11 of the Labelling and sections 2, 3, 
4, 5 and 6 of the Package Leaflet for the medicinal 
products Anoro and Laventair containing the active 
substances Umeclidinium Bromide and Vilanterol 
following the assessment of the medicinal products 
Trelegy and Rolufta Ellipta, which also contains the 
active substances fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium 
bromide and vilanterol, via procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004363/R/0023 and 
EMEA/H/C/004654/R/0019. The same wording is 
used for the combination product.
The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated 
accordingly. The Annex II is updated. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor 
editorial changes and to bring the PI in line with the 
latest QRD template (version 10.3).
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
posology. In section 4.5 a new sentence is added: 
“Clinically significant interactions mediated by 
umeclidinium/vilanterol at clinical doses are considered 
unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved 
after inhaled dosing.” to harmonize with Trelegy Ellipta and 
Rolufta Ellipta SmPC. And in section 5.2 an additional 
statement: “Vilanterol has a low association with red blood 
cells.” for vilanterol component, is added to align with the 
same in Trelegy Ellipta SmPC 5.2.
Changes to the product information for those products were 
accepted to update the texts in line with the QRD template 
as well as to remove duplication of adverse events related 
to Rash. 
The MAH has updated the Product Information to list the 
appropriate lactose quantity, 24 mg, rather than the 
amount of the monohydrate.

The primary objective of the study was to report the 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.
Submission of the final report from study 
WWE117397 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This was a retrospective longitudinal non-
interventional observational study of new users of 
inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) or new 
users of inhaled umeclidinium (UMEC) or new users 
or long-acting bronchodilators (LABD) in the primary 
proportion of patients with a possible off-label use and 
characterize them in new users of UMEC/VI, UMEC, or other 
LABD. The second objective was to quantify incidence of 
major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, mortality 
and pneumonia, and rates of exacerbations of COPD during 
follow-up in new users of UMEC/VI or UMEC. The tertiary 
objective was in new users of UMEC/VI or UMEC with 12 or 
more months of follow-up following initiation, to describe 
treatment patterns and adherence. Despite the fact that 
several limitations were identified in data sources and did

care setting.
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority
not allow to drawn sound conclusions for all the study 
objectives, the final report provides insight on UMEC and 
UMEC/VI utilisation patterns, including off-label prescribing 
rate of UMEC and UMEC/VI compared to other LABD in a 
primary care UK setting. Overall, the incidence of 
cardiovascular events and respiratory outcomes was as 
expected for these products classes, and no new safety 
signals were identified. Mortality rates reported in this 
study (using linked CPRD-HES-ONS) data are comparable 
to those reported using the same dataset for other LAMAs. 
The analysis of treatment patterns during the first 12 
months after initiating treatment with UMEC or UMEC/VI 
showed a good level of continuity for the majority of new 
users. No major difference in treatment patterns of on-label 
or potential off-label use for both UMEC and UMEC/VI users 
was noted in all groups. It can also be concluded that in 
this setting the analysis reveals a moderate level of 
adherence to UMEC and UMEC/VI treatment. Overall, based 
on the data reviwed no change to the product information 
was deemed necessary.

As per PRAC recommendation for Anoro/Laventair Ellipta 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.
Submission of an updated RMP version 8.0 following 
the renewal procedures (EMEA/H/C/4002751/R/0022 
and EMEA/H/C/003754/R/0025) commitments to 
remove the important identified risks of 
‘hypersensitivity’ and ‘paradoxical bronchospasm’ 
from the list of safety concerns and to update all 
renewal procedures (EMEA/H/C/4002751/R/0022 and 
EMEA/H/C/003754/R/0025), the MAH updated the RMP in 
line with GVP revision 2, including the removal of the 
important identified risks of ‘Hypersensitivity’ and 
‘Paradoxical bronchospasm’. The product information of 
Anoro/Laventair has a warning to inform HCPs and patients 
on the risk of ‘paradoxical bronchospasm’ following 
administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol and section 4.8 of 
the SmPC list the adverse drug reaction (ADRs) with 
relevant sections of the RMP in line with revision 2 of 
frequency ‘rare’. Hypersensitivity reactions including: Rash, 
Page 7/17
GVP module V on ‘Risk management systems’ and 
revision 2 of the guidance on the format of the RMP 
in the EU (template). In addition, the important 
potential risks of ‘narrow angle glaucoma’ and 
‘bladder outflow obstruction and urinary retention’ 
are removed; as well as the missing information on 
‘safety in pregnancy and lactation’, ‘safety in long-
term use’ and ‘safety in severe hepatic impairment’.
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required
Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria are listed as ADRs 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The current risk minimisation 
measures are considered sufficient to minimise the risks.As 
per PRAC recommendations issued in July 2016 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010264/201512), the important 
potential risks of ‘glaucoma’ and ‘bladder outflow 
obstruction/urinary retention’ are removed from the RMP. 
‘Bladder outflow obstruction and urinary retention’ and 
‘glaucoma’ are ADRs listed in section 4.8 of SmPC of 
Anoro/Laventair with frequency ‘rare’. The current risk 
minimisation measures are considered sufficient to 
minimise the risks. 
In preclinical studies, no evidence of a direct embryotoxic, 
fetotoxic, or teratogenic outcome was observed. The use of 
Anoro/Laventair during pregnancy is currently under 
routine PV monitoring and periodically reviewed in PSURs. 
Review of this data did not identify any new safety concern 
in this population. There are no cumulative reports of 
umeclidinium / vilanterol exposure during breast feeding. 
The product information of Anoro/Laventair in section 4.6 
of the SmPC includes information addressing the safety in 
pregnancy and lactation. The current risk minimisation 
measures are considered sufficient to minimise the risk 
therefore ‘safety in pregnancy and lactation’ as missing 
information is removed from the RMP.
Clinical pharmacology studies were performed in severe 
renal and moderate hepatic impaired subjects. Patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment showed no evidence of 
an increase in systemic exposure to either umeclidinium or 
vilanterol, and no evidence of altered protein binding 
between patients with moderate hepatic impairment and 
healthy volunteers. Conversely, no clinical pharmacology 
Page 8/17
studies were performed in severe hepatic impaired 
patients. Umeclidinium is mainly metabolized by the 
hepatic CYP2D6 pathway; no difference in systemic 
exposure of umeclidinium has been shown in poor versus 
extensive metabolisers. Section 4.2 of the SmPC includes 
information on safety in sever hepatic impairment  Based 
on the above, a change in benefit risk profile in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment is not expected. Therefore, 
‘Safety in severe hepatic impairment use’ as missing 
information is removed from the RMP.
From the last PSUSA 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010264/201712) no specific pattern 
in reported AEs was seen in patients who had received 
Anoro/ Laventair Ellipta for longer than one year. There are 
no data suggesting that the safety of Anoro/ Laventair 
Ellipta in the long term may differ from the known safety 
profile. Safety in long-term use as missing information is 
therefore removed from the RMP.

The procedure started as a modification of indication in 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.
Update of a section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add 
efficacy information based on the 52-week study 
CTT116855; a 52-week study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy of FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 compared 
with dual therapy of FF/VI 100/25 or UMEC/VI 
62.5/25 in subjects with COPD. 
In addition, clarification on information related to the 
24 week study submitted at time of initial 
authorisation is introduced in section 5.1.
order to reflect prevention on COPD exacerbations in the 
approved indication. The evaluation of the presented data 
led to an update of section 5.1 to describe information that 
may be relevant for the prescribers to take decisions in the 
step wise approach to COPD management. 
Results from the IMPACT study do not allow ascertaining 
the exact contribution of Anoro Ellipta to the reduction in 
the rate of exacerbations. However the data are considered 
relevant from the clinical point of view taking into account 
the known correlation between exacerbations and 
morbidity/mortality. The following data added to section 
5.1: In the randomised, double-blind, 52-week study 
Page 9/17
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
modification of an approved one
(CTT116855, IMPACT), 10,355 adult patients with 
symptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more 
moderate/severe exacerbations in the prior 12 months 
were randomised (1:2:2) to receive umeclidinium/vilanterol 
(UMEC/VI 55/22 micrograms), fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 92/55/22 
micrograms), or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI 92/22 
micrograms) administered once daily as a single inhaler. 
The primary endpoint was annual rate of on-treatment 
moderate and severe exacerbations in subjects treated with 
FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI. The mean 
annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91, 1.07 and 1.21 for 
FF/UMEC/VI, FF/VI, and UMEC/VI respectively.
The comparison of FF/UMEC/VI to FF/VI and UMEC/VI 
resulted in a statistically significant 14.8% reduction in risk 
of a moderate/severe exacerbation (based on analysis of 
time to first exacerbation) (Hazard Ratio 0.85; 95% CI: 
0.80, 0.91; p<0.001) and 16.0% reduction in risk of a 
moderate/severe exacerbation respectively (based on 
analysis of time to first exacerbation) (Hazard Ratio 0.84; 
95% CI: 0.78, 0.91; p<0.001). 
In addition, clarification on information related to the 24 
week study submitted at time of initial authorisation is 
introduced in section 5.1 , in particular  information on the 
severity of disease in the trial population studied in the 24 
week efficacy study, as well as information on the risk 
ratios and confidence intervals.

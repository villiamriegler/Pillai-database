INTRODUCTION 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, Merck Sharp & Dohme, is submitting 
the final report for a paediatric clinical study  (Protocol PN248), a Phase II, open-label trial to evaluate 
the  safety  and  tolerability  of  Isentress  in  HIV-infected  children  2  to  <18  years,  receiving  either  the 
raltegravir 400 mg film-coated tablet or the chewable tablet formulations.  
The  MAH  states  that  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  N°  726/2004,  the  data 
submitted  do  not  influence  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  Isentress  and  therefore  do  not  require  taking 
further regulatory action on the marketing authorization for Isentress at this stage. 
II. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. Introduction 
Raltegravir  is  a  HIV  integrase  strand  transfer  inhibitor  approved  in  both  treatment-  experienced  and 
treatment-naïve  adult  patients.  Raltegravir  received  initial  marketing  authorization  in  2007  in  adult 
treatment-experienced and in July 2009 in treatment-naïve adult patients at a dose of 400 mg BID.  
Based  on  complete  24  week  and  partial  48  week  data  from  a  Phase  I/II  study  in  HIV-1  infected 
children  and  adolescents,  IMPAACT  P1066  (Merck  Protocol  022),  raltegravir  received  marketing 
authorization  in the  European  Union  (February  2013)  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  2  to  18 
years  of  age.  An  extension  application  (EMEA/H/C/000860/X/44/G)  submitted  in  June  2013  for 
granules  for  oral  suspension  in  children  from  4  weeks  to  <  2years  of  age  is  currently  under  EMA 
review. 
2. Study P 248 
A  Phase  II,  multicenter,  open-label,  non-comparative  study  of  raltegravir  (MK-0518)  in  two  oral 
formulations  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability  and 
antiretroviral activity in HIV-1 infected Russian children and adolescents. 
Data  collected  from  this  single  country  clinical  study  in  a  local  patient  population  was  intended  to 
supplement the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data already generated in IMPAACT P1066 
in the 2 to 18 year age range. 
This trial was conducted in ten (10) centres, of which nine (9) allocated subjects to study treatment. 
Ethical conduct 
The  MAH  states  that  “clinical  trials  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  current  standard  research 
approaches  with  regard  to  the  design,  conduct,  and  analysis  of  such  trials  including  the  archiving  of 
essential  documents.  All  trials  were  conducted  following  appropriate  Good  Clinical  Practice  standards 
and considerations for the ethical treatment of human subjects that were in place at the time the trials 
were performed.”

2.1 Description of the study 
Both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients were eligible to participate in this study.  
Thirty-two (32) HIV-infected paediatric patients, ages 2 years to <18 years of age (at the time 
of  signing  the  informed  consent)  participated  in  this  study.  Treatment-experienced  patients  included 
patients who were failing or who were intolerant to other licensed ARTs.  
Patients weighing > 7kg, with a screening HIV RNA >1,000 copies/mL, were eligible. Patients with ALT, 
AST  or  AP  >  5x  ULN  or  HCV  or  HBV  co-infection  were  excluded.  The  study  treatment  duration  for  a 
given patient was 24 weeks.  
Co-  administration  of  phenobarbital,  phenytoin  and  rifampicin  was  prohibited.  Use  of  systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulators within one month prior to treatment in this study 
was also prohibited 
Based  on  the  U.S.  Prescribing  Information  (USPI)  at  the  time  Protocol 248  was  started,  the  following 
dosing recommendation by age group were studied:  
• 
• 
• 
patients 12 to 18 years: 400 mg twice daily (BID) of the film-coated tablet;  
patients 6 to < 12 years: either 400 mg BID of the film-coated tablet (if ≥25 kg) or a weight-
based dose of the chewable tablet formulation (maximum of 300 mg) BID;  
patients 2 to <  6 years: a weight based dose of the chewable tablet formulation (maximum of 
300 mg) BID.  
The chewable tablets are available in dose strengths of 100 mg (scored) and 25 mg.  
The study physician determined which raltegravir formulation to administer.

•  Objectives 
Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of raltegravir in two oral formulations (film-
coated tablets, chewable tablets) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in pediatric patients, 
as assessed by review of accumulated safety data. 
Secondary  Objective:  Evaluate  the  antiretroviral  activity  of  raltegravir  in  two  oral  formulations  in 
combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  in  pediatric  patients,  as  measured  by  the  following 
parameters at Week 24: 
•  Proportion  of  patients  achieving  ≥1  log10  drop  from  baseline in  HIV  RNA  or  HIV  RNA  <200 
copies/mL 
• Proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL 
• Proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA <200 copies/mL 
• Change from baseline in CD4 cell counts (cells/mm3) 
• Change from baseline in CD4 percent 
•  Statistical Methods 
All efficacy and safety analyses provided descriptive statistics only; no formal comparisons were made 
between the groups receiving the different formulations. 
Primary analysis: The All-Patients-as-Treated (APaT) population was employed for safety analyses. The 
APaT population consisted of all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. 
Secondary  analysis:  The  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  population.  The 
FAS population included all patients who took at least one dose of study medication, and had baseline 
(required for change from baseline endpoints only) and at least one postbaseline evaluation.

The proportion of patients with virologic responses (achieving ≥1 log10 drop from baseline in HIV RNA 
or HIV RNA <200 copies/mL; achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL; achieving HIV RNA <200 copies/mL) 
was  summarized  for  the  whole  population  as  well  as  by  formulation  group  at  each  time  point,  with 
primary interest at Week 24. Point estimate and the associated 95% CI calculated using exact binomial 
method were provided. 
The  Observed  Failure  (OF)  approach  was  used  as  the  primary  approach  to  handle  missing  HIV  RNA 
values. Under this approach, monotone missing values after premature discontinuations were imputed 
as failures if the discontinuation was due to lack of efficacy.  
Other  missing  values  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  In  addition  to  the  OF  approach,  sensitivity 
analysis was performed using the Non-Completer = Failure (NC=F) approach.

The  medical  history  profiles  of  patients  were  consistent  with  those  expected  for  children  with  HIV 
infection. Most secondary diagnoses were infections and infestations and blood and lymphatic system 
disorders. The most common (≥10% in all patients) condition reported overall was anemia. 
•  Antiretroviral therapy 
Raltegravir  could  have  been  taken  without  regard  to  food.  At  baseline,  the  investigator  selected  the 
other  ARTs  to  be  used  in  combination  with  raltegravir  based  on  current  treatment  guidelines,  the 
patient's prior treatment history, the results of the HIV-1 genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing at 
screening, and prior antiretroviral resistance testing, if available. 
The treatment regimen consisted of ARTs approved and licensed for use in adult patients, even if not 
currently approved for use in paediatric patients. Any changes in background ART while on study were 
discussed with the Sponsor or designee. Unless the change was specifically permitted, patients whose 
background ART was changed after initiation of study therapy were considered treatment failures. The 
following changes to background therapy were permitted during the study: 
• Substitution within class or rarely, across class for documented toxicity 
• Discontinuation of a background ART 
• Formula substitutions

2.2.3 Safety results (Primary analysis) 
The  mean  duration  (range)  of  treatment  for  the  raltegravir  film-coated  tablet at  any  dose  was  170.5 
days (167 to 174 days). Patients in this formulation group were mostly exposed to 800 mg daily of the 
film-coated  tablet.    The  mean  duration  (range)  for  the  raltegravir  chewable  tablet  at  any  dose  was 
171.8 days (28 to 224 days). Patients in this formulation group were mostly exposed to 300 mg daily

(14  patients)  and  150  mg  daily  (12  patients),  with  the  300  mg  dose  daily  having  the  greatest  mean 
duration (166.2 days). 
Clinical and laboratory adverse events at 24 Weeks for the APaT population  
Clinical  adverse  events  were  reported  by  12  (37.5%)  patients  overall.  Drug-related  clinical  adverse 
events  were  reported  by  4  (12.5%)  patients  overall.  Laboratory  adverse  events  were  reported  by  1 
(3.1%)  patient  overall.  Drug-related  laboratory  adverse  events  were  reported  by  1  (3.1%)  patient 
overall. There were no serious adverse events, deaths, discontinuations due to  
an adverse event, or adverse events of special interest reported in this study. 
Clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  alone  were  reported  in  3  (9.4%)  of  the  32  treated 
patients  overall.  The  drug-related  clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  alone  were  the 
following: diarrhea, vomiting, and somnambulism.

All  3  clinical  adverse  events  were  experienced  by  patients  in  the  raltegravir  chewable  tablet  group. 
Patient  1  xperienced  vomiting  on  Day  77  (450  mg  total  daily  dose).  The  event  was  assessed  by  the 
investigator  as  mild  in  intensity.  It  persisted  for  1  minute  then  resolved.  Patient  2  experienced 
somnambulism  on  Day  29  (400  mg  total  daily  dose).  The  event  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
mild in intensity. It persisted for 63 days then resolved. Patient 3 experienced diarrhea on Day 3 (300 
mg total daily dose). The event was assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. It persisted for 2 
days then resolved. 
Clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  in  combination  with  background  ART  were  reported  in  1 
(3.1%) of the 32 treated patients overall. 
The  drug-related  clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  in  combination  with  background  ART 
were  the  following:  abdominal  pain  and  nausea.  The  patient  who  experienced  the  2  clinical  adverse 
events was in the raltegravir chewable tablet group. Patient 4 experienced abdominal pain and nausea 
on Day 1 (300 mg total daily dose). The events were assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. 
They persisted for 6 days then resolved. 
There were no patients in either formulation group who experienced laboratory adverse events that 
were related to raltegravir alone. Laboratory adverse events related to raltegravir in combination with 
background ART were reported in 1 (3.1%) of the 32 treated patients overall. 
The  patient  who  experienced  the  laboratory  adverse  event  was  in  the  raltegravir  chewable  tablet 
group.  Patient  4  experienced  a  decrease  in  platelet  count  on  Day  85  (150  mg  total  daily  dose).  The 
event was assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. It persisted for 84 days then resolved. 
2.2.4 Efficacy results (Secondary analysis) 
At Week 24, 86.2% of patients overall achieved ≥1 log10 drop from baseline in HIV RNA or HIV RNA 
<200  copies/mL.  At  Week  24,  the  proportion  of  patients  overall  with  HIV  RNA  at  <40  copies/mL  and 
<200  copies/mL  were  44.8%  and  72.4%,  respectively.  The  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CD4  cell 
count and percent were 266.7 cells/mm3 and 5.7%, respectively. 
Efficacy analyses were all based on the Observed Failure approach. 
Plasma  HIV  RNA  and  CD4  count  were  performed  at  each  clinic  visit.  Plasma  HIV  RNA  determination 
was  performed  at  each  visit,  by  a  central  laboratory  specified  by  the  Sponsor  or  designee,  using  the 
Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay, which has a linear range of 40 to 10,000,000 copies/mL. 
Blood samples for genotypic viral resistance testing were collected at the Screening visit and at Week 
24 or the 14-Day post-therapy follow-up (if not already obtained at the Week 24 visit) or at an Early 
discontinuation visit (if applicable) and were tested in patients identified as confirmed virologic failures.

Viral resistance 
Definition of virologic failure for the efficacy analyses: 
1)  Non-responder:  patients  who  never  achieved  ≥1  log10  drop  from  baseline  in  plasma  HIV  RNA  or 
HIV RNA <200 copies/mL through Week 24 
OR 
2) Virologic rebound at Week 24, defined as: 
a) Confirmed HIV RNA ≥200 copies/mL (on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart) after 
initial response with HIV RNA <200 copies/mL or 
b)  Confirmed  >1.0  log10  increase  in  HIV  RNA  above  nadir  level  (on  2  consecutive  measurements  at 
least 1 week apart). 
Of  the  4  viral  failure  patients,  3  had  post-baseline  genotypic  data  available.  (Testing  on  the  4th 
patient’s sample could not be performed). Overall in the 3 patients with post-baseline genotype data, 
viruses  from  1  patient  displayed  a  signature  resistance  mutation  (at  AA  155),  along  with  L74I.  The 
other 2 patients had no signature mutations at AA 143, 148, or 155 (1 patient had another known RAL 
resistance mutation [L74I, which by itself does not confer resistance to raltegravir, and 1 patient had 
no other known RAL resistance mutations). 
MAH’s discussion and conclusion 
The  general  patterns  of  safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  were  comparable  to  the  results  found  in  the 
IMPAACT  P1066  study,  a  Phase  1/2  multicenter,  open-label,  noncomparative  study  of  HIV-infected 
children and adolescents ≥2 to <19 years of age to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, 
and  efficacy  of  raltegravir  (film-coated  tablet  and  chewable  tablet  formulations)  in  this  HIV-infected 
age population. In the IMPAACT P1066 study, there were also no deaths or discontinuations due to an 
adverse event. Of the 96 final dose patients, 87.5% experienced clinical adverse events (including 14 
serious  adverse  events  and  1  serious  drug-related  adverse  event)  and  88.5% experienced laboratory 
adverse  events  (including  1  serious  adverse  event  and  no  serious  drug-related  adverse  events).  The 
higher  frequency  of  clinical  and  laboratory  adverse  events  (including  serious  adverse  events)  may  be 
due to the greater number of treatment experienced patients with more advanced HIV disease in the 
IMPAACT P1066 study. As mentioned, there was only 1 serious drug-related adverse event overall. 
The  efficacy  data  (likewise  based  on  the  OF  approach)  at  Week  24  in  the  IMPAACT  P1066  study  was 
also  very  similar  to  that  of  the  P248  study.  At  Week  24,  overall  patient  data  demonstrated  71.6% 
achieved  ≥1  log10  drop  from  baseline  in  HIV  RNA  or  HIV  RNA  <400  copies/mL.  At  Week  24,  the 
proportion  of  patients  overall  with  HIV  RNA  at  <50  copies/mL  and  <400  copies/mL  were  53.7%  and

66.3%,  respectively.  Immunologic  benefit  was  also  demonstrated  at  Week  24  for  all  patients:  the 
mean  change  from  baseline  in  CD4  cell  counts  and  CD4  percent  were  119  cells/mm3  and  3.8%, 
respectively. The P248 study had more stringent efficacy endpoints and had higher overall percentages 
of patients achieving those endpoints as compared with the IMPAACT P1066 study. Again, this may be 
due to sample size and demographic differences. 
Data  from  P248  based  on  the  OF  approach  demonstrated  that  raltegravir  in  combination  with  other 
ARTs  has  acceptable  efficacy  at  Week  24  in  the  Russian  paediatric  population,  as  measured  by  key 
efficacy  parameters.  There  were  3  additional  supportive  endpoints  recorded  in  this  study  at  Week  24 
(≥1 log10 drop or <400 copies/mL; <50 copies/mL; <400 copies/mL), and the results for these were 
generally consistent with the corresponding primary endpoints. 
Immunologic  benefit  was  also  demonstrated  at  Week  24  for  all  patients,  based  on  the  OF  approach: 
the mean change from baseline in CD4 cell counts and CD4 percent were 266.7 cells/mm3 and 5.7%, 
respectively.  The  results  of  analyses  for  patients  overall  using  the  NC=F  approach  were  generally 
comparable to the results using the OF approach. 
In Russian HIV-infected children and adolescents ≥2 to <18 years of age, raltegravir administered as 
either  the  adult  film-coated  tablet  formulation  or  the  pediatric  chewable  tablet  formulation,  in 
combination with an optimized background antiretroviral regimen, through 24 weeks, 
• was generally safe and well tolerated as chronic therapy at the recommended dose, 
•  had  a  favorable  antiretroviral  effect  as  measured  by  the  proportions  of  patients  who  achieved  pre-
specified virologic responses, 
•  and  demonstrated  immunological  benefit  as  measured  by  changes  from  baseline  in  CD4  cell  count 
and CD4 percent. 
The MAH states that efficacy and safety data collected from Protocol 248, which evaluated raltegravir 
use in pediatric patients 2 to <18 years of age in Russia, are consistent with data collected in the 
pediatric study IMPAACT P1066, thereby continuing to support the conclusion that there is a favourable 
benefit/risk ratio with administration of raltegravir at the appropriate recommended dose in HIV 
infected paediatric patients in this age group. 
CHMP’s comment 
In this study, children were dosed according to the US prescribing information. EU prescribing 
information differs from the US posology insofar as Isentress is not approved in the EU for children 
weighing less than 12kg and children weighing 12- <14kg receive a dose of 75mg bd. Difference in 
dosing and possibly exposure would hence be expected for children weighing 10- 12kg. The report 
does not allow verifying if any children from this weight bracket were included in the study. 
The majority of patients (>80%) were treatment naive. Most presented with a VL <100,000c/ml and a 
CD 4 count > 500 cells/mm3. Twenty- eight of the 32 subjects received the chewable tablet, only four 
the film coated tablet.  
The information on concomitant ART is limited. The most commonly used NRTIs were lamivudine, 
zidovudine, and abacavir. Only two patients received an NNRTI (efavirenz), and 3 (?4) received a PI. 
Study duration was 24 weeks.

No PK data were collected. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the efficacy results of this small 
study, which were reportedly in line with previous paediatric results. The evaluation of safety did not 
produce any unexpected results. Overall 12.5% of patients experienced drug related AEs. The study 
was not designed to compare formulations. 
III.  CHMP’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
The  MAH  submitted  the  final  report  for  P248,  a  Phase  II,  multicenter,  open-label,  non-comparative 
study of raltegravir (MK-0518) in two oral formulations in combination with other antiretroviral agents 
to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability  and  antiretroviral  activity  in  HIV-1  infected  Russian  children  and 
adolescents. 
A chewable tablet and weight- based dose is already approved for children weighing 12kg or more in 
the EU. An application for granules for oral suspension in children from 4 weeks to < 2years of age is 
currently under EMA review. The doses used in this trial are largely in line with the EU prescribing 
information. 
The additional information obtained from this study is limited. The MAH does not consider that the 
study results require changes to the product information to be made. The CHMP agrees.  
  Recommendation  
  Fulfilled – No further action required.

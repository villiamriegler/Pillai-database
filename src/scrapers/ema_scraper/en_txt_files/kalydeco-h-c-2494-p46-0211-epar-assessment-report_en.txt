1.  Introduction 
On 1 December 2014, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric study (VX10-770-107) for 
Kalydeco (Ivacaftor), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Kalydeco 
and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study VX10-770-107 is a stand-alone study. No line listing is provided, since 
the study is not specifically part of a development program. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
The  pharmaceutical  formulation  used  in  this  study  was  ivacaftor  150-mg  film  coated  tablets, 
essentially the same as the currently approved formulation. Ivacaftor 150-mg tablets were used for 
the  adolescent  subjects  recruited  in  the  study;  hence  no  specific  paediatric  formulation  was 
required for this study. 
Ivacaftor  150-mg  tablets  were  administered  under  similar  conditions  as  the  approved  SmPC  for 
Kalydeco: 
-  Orally at a dosage of 150 mg q12h 
-  Recommended to  take  study  drug  30  minutes  after the  start  of  a  standard  “CF”  high  fat,  high 
calorie meal or snack. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Kalydeco  (ivacaftor)  was  first  authorised  23  July  2012  via  the  centralised  procedure  in  the 
European Union. Kalydeco is currently indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 
aged  6  years  and  older  who  have  one  of  the  following  gating  (class  III)  mutations  in  the  CFTR 
gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. 
The MAH submitted final reports for: 
•  Study VX10-770-107, A Phase 2, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Effect 
of VX-770 (ivacaftor) on Hyperpolarized Helium-3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Subjects with 
Cystic Fibrosis, the G551D Mutation, and FEV1 ≥40% Predicted. 
2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
Study VX10-770-107 
Description 
The  purpose  of  this  exploratory  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  ivacaftor  on  hyperpolarized 
helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging (3He-MRI), with the view to determine if the latter could be 
a potential biomarker of lung function in CF trials.

Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary Objective 
The primary objectives of the study were to assess the short-term (28 days, part A) and long-term 
(48  weeks,  part  B)  effects  of  ivacaftor  on  hyperpolarized  helium-3  magnetic  resonance  imaging 
(He-MRI),  with  the  aim  to  explore  the  possibility  of  using  this  imaging  technique  as  a  potential 
biomarker of lung function in CF studies.   
Secondary Objectives 
To  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  VX-770  in  subjects  aged  12  years  and  older  with  CF  who 
have the G551D-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele. 
Exploratory Objective 
To evaluate 3He-MRI “Ventilation Segmentation” automated quantification method. 
•  Study design 
Part A: a Phase 2, single-blind, placebo-controlled study of orally administered VX-770 in subjects 
with CF. The study included a Screening Visit, 4 weeks of VX-770 treatment, 4 weeks of placebo 
treatment, and a follow-up telephone call. 
Part B: a Phase 2, open-label, 48-week study of orally administered VX-770 in subjects with CF. 
The study included a Screening Visit, 48 weeks of VX-770 treatment, and a Follow-up Visit. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Male and female subjects with CF who were ages 12 years and older with G551D-CFTR mutation on 
at least 1 allele and≥40% predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) value.  
The  number  of  subjects  planned  in  part  A  was  2  to  8  subjects;  a  maximum  of  12  subjects  were 
planned  to  be  enrolled  in  part  B.    The  chosen  sample  sizes  were  based  primarily  on  operational 
considerations. Thus, no power analysis was performed. 
•  Treatments 
VX-770 -matched placebo tablet was administered orally q12h (recommended to take study drug 
30 minutes after the start of a standard “CF” high fat, high calorie meal or snack). 
Blue, film-coated tablet with wax. 
Subjects  were  not  allowed  to  take  Grapefruit/grapefruit  juice,  Seville  orange/marmalade,  CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers, Inhaled hypertonic saline treatment or commercially Kalydeco™. Subjects 
were  allowed  to  continue  their  prior  inhaled  antibiotics  and  bronchodilators  during  the  study 
periods. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
In  Part  A,  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  change  from  Day  15  Visit  to  Day  43  Visit  in  total 
ventilation  defect.  Average  change  from  Day  15  Visit  to  Day  29  and  Day  43  Visits  were  also 
summarized.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/534823/2015 
Page 4/25 
 
 
 
In  Part  B,  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  average  change  from  baseline  through  Week  48  in  total 
ventilation  defect  was  summarized  by  human  reader  and  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm. 
Change from baseline to each scheduled visit was also summarized. 
In  both  parts  of  the  study,  safety  was  assessed  in  terms  of  the  following  secondary  (safety) 
endpoints:  Incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs);  Clinical  laboratory  values 
(including coagulation studies); Electrocardiogram (ECG) outcomes, and Vital signs. 
Total defect volume (L), total lung volume (L), and total number of defects were obtained from the 
3He-MRI  record  of  each  subject  as  exploratory  endpoints  in  both  parts  of  the  study.  Total 
ventilation defect was defined as the ratio of total defect volume to total lung volume, expressed as 
a  percentage.  Analysis  for  total  ventilation  defect  was  determined  by  “Ventilation  Segmentation” 
algorithm  was  performed  per  the  schedule  of  assessments.  Each  individual  parameter  was  also 
summarized.  
A  Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  Evaluation  was  conducted  in  Part  A  only.  Blood  pharmacokinetic  samples 
were to be collected to determine the plasma concentrations of VX-770 and metabolites M1 and M6 
at the Day 29, Day 43, and Early Termination Visits. 
•  Statistical Methods 
For  efficacy  and  safety  assessments,  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  was  used,  which  included  all 
enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., VX-770 or placebo). 
Efficacy Analyses:  
Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to assess within subject change. Raw values and changes 
from  baseline  were  also  summarized.  Total  ventilation  defect  was  further  summarized  by  FEV1 
severity.    Additional  summary  included:  total  ventilation  defect  by  human  reader,  and  each 
individual  parameter  (total  defect  volume,  total  lung  volume,  and  total  number  of  defects), 
evaluated by reader-averaged value and by individual reader. 
Predicted  FEV1  (KNUFEV  [L])  was  calculated  using  the  Knudson  method  and  percent  predicted 
FEV1 was the ratio of FEV1 to KNUFEV, expressed as a percentage. Responder rate defined by ≥5 
percentage  point  change  from  baseline  at  each  visit  (including  the  Safety  Follow-up  Visit)  in 
percent predicted FEV1 were summarized. 
Change  from  baseline  in  sweat  chloride  was  calculated  as  Left  Right  Base  mean  (SWright ,  SWleft)- 
SWbase  ,  where  SW  Left  and  SWRight  were  the  measurements  obtained  on  the  left  and  right  arms, 
respectively,  at  a  particular  visit  and  SWbase  was  the  mean  of  right  and  left  baseline 
measurements. If 1 of the 2 measurements at a time point was missing, the other was used as the 
mean.  In  Part  A,  change  from  Day  15  Visit  to Day  43  Visit,  average  change  from  Day  15  Visit  to 
Day  29  and  Day  43  Visits  in  sweat  chloride  were  summarized.  Raw  values  and  changes  from 
baseline in each treatment phase were also summarized. In Part B, average change from baseline 
through  Week  48,  change  from  baseline  to  each  scheduled  visit  (including  the  Safety  Follow-up 
Visit) in sweat chloride were summarized. 
Safety  analysis:  Continuous  variables  (e.g.,  blood  pressure)  were  summarized  by  means  of 
descriptive  statistics  and  categorical  variables  (e.g.,  presence  of  an  adverse  event  [AE])  were 
summarized  by  contingency  tables.  Only  descriptive  analysis  of  safety  were  performed  (i.e.,  no 
statistical testing was performed). 
Pharmacokinetics  Analyses  (Part  A  only):  PK  of  VX-770  and  metabolites,  M1  and  M6,  were 
characterized  as  trough  concentration.  Bioanalysis  was  not  conducted  on  samples  when  subjects 
were administered placebo.

Summary statistics were calculated for the number of observations (N), arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) in Part A on Day 29 and 43. 
Compliance  was  informally  assessed  by  identifying  subjects  with  abhorrent  plasma  concentration 
values with drug accountability records. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In  Part  A,  8  subjects  were  enrolled;  the  FAS  and  the  Safety  Set  were  identical.  All  subjects 
completed dosing and there were no discontinuations from the study. 
A total of 9 subjects enrolled in Part B. Four of the subjects from part A  were allowed to enrol in 
part B of this study. Eight subjects completed dosing, and 7 subjects completed the safety follow-
up  visit.  The  reason  for  not  completing  the  study  in  the  2  subjects  who  discontinued  was 
withdrawal of consent after the last dose (and they did not complete their safety follow-up visits). 
Baseline data 
Most of the subjects in Part A were White (n=7, 87.5%) with a mean age of 18.9 years (range: 12, 
25)  and  mean  baseline  percent  predicted  FEV1  of  89.95%.  There  were  an  equal  number  of  male 
and  female  subjects.  Six  out  of  8  subjects  had  G551D/F508del-CFTR  mutations,  1  subject  had 
G551D/unknown mutations, and 1 subject had G551D/G542X mutations. 
In Part B, all 9 (100%) subjects were White, with a mean age of 24.4 years (range: 13, 48) and 
mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 74.08%. Six out of 9 (66.7%) subjects were male. Seven 
out of 9 subjects had G551D/F508del-CFTR mutations, 1 subject had G551D/Unknown mutations, 
and 1 subject had G551D/G551D mutations. 
Efficacy results 
Part A 
Primary endpoint 
During  Placebo  Run-in,  the  mean  total  ventilation  defect  values  showed  small  changes  from 
baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  2.20  [7.583]  by  human  reader  and  1.79  [6.098]  by  ventilation 
segmentation  algorithm)  that  were  not  statistically  significant.  During  VX-770  Treatment  Period, 
the total ventilation defect decreased significantly in the first 2 weeks of treatment (Days 15 to 29 
mean  [SD]  change  from  baseline  of  -8.50  [8.580]  by  human  reader  and  -6.28  [16.378]  by 
ventilation  segmentation  algorithm)  and  remained  decreased  through  the  second  2  weeks  of 
treatment (Days 15 to 43 mean [SD] change from baseline of -8.20 [9.013] by human reader and 
-12.81  [10.047]  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm).  After  the  Placebo  Washout,  the  total 
ventilation defect values returned to levels similar to those at the start of the Placebo Run-in.

from  baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  -3.95  [4.929]).  During  VX-770  Treatment  Period,  the  percent 
predicted  FEV1  increased  significantly  from  baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  9.57  [11.297])  for  the  first  2 
weeks  [Day  15  to  Day  29])  and  this  increase  sustained  through  Day  43  (mean  [SD]  of  12.78 
[9.203]). After the Placebo Washout, the percent predicted FEV1 returned to similar level as Day 1.

baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  -2.88  [8.943]).  During  VX-770  Treatment  Period,  the  sweat  chloride 
decreased significantly from baseline (mean [SD] of -39.19 [13.541]) for the first 2 weeks (Day 15 
to Day 29) and this decrease sustained through Day 43 (mean [SD] of -42.31 [13.475]). After the 
Placebo Washout, the sweat chloride values returned to the similar level as Day 1.

Table 11-5 provides the within-subject absolute change from baseline in pooled CFQ-R respiratory 
domain  score  by  treatment  phase.  During  Placebo  Run-in,  the  CFQ-R  values  showed  a  small 
increase  from  baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  2.78  [6.640]).  During  VX-770  Treatment  Period,  the  score 
decreased  from  baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  -2.08  [25.361]  during  Day  15  to  Day  29  and  -7.64 
[27.529]  during  Day  15  to  Day  43).  The  mean  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  score  continued  to 
decrease during the Placebo Washout. This observation was not consistent with other studies with 
VX-770,  and  the  mean  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  score  during  the  VX-770  treatment  period  may 
have been influenced by a small number of outlying values.

Primary endpoint 
Table  11-2  provides  the  within-subject  change  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  by  study 
visit.  With  the  exception  of  the  human  reader  result  at  Day  15,  the  decrease  in  total  ventilation 
defect  by  human  reader  and  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm  was  greater  during  VX-770 
treatment  (Day  1  through  Week  48)  than  after  the  treatment  (Week  52).  The  effect  across  time 
appeared to be reasonably stable. After the end of VX-770 Treatment Period, the total ventilation 
defect values returned to levels similar to those at baseline. 
The changes from baseline in total ventilation defect were consistent with those observed in Part A 
and generally not statistically significant; however, the analysis was limited by the sample size of 
the study.

Correlation Analysis 
Mean changes in total ventilation defect and mean changes in percent predicted FEV1 values for all 
8 subjects in Part A (Day 15 Visit to Day 57 Visit) are shown in Figure 11-11 and for all 9 subjects 
in  Part  B  (Day  1  to  Week  52)  are  shown  in  Figure  11-12,  respectively.  In  Part  A  and  Part  B,  the 
total ventilation defect during VX-770 treatment decreased significantly (both as quantified by the 
human  reader  and  by  a  computer  algorithm)  and  percent  predicted  FEV1  increased  significantly. 
After  the  end  of  VX-770  treatment,  total  ventilation  defect  values  and  percent  predicted  FEV1 
values returned to levels similar to those at baseline.

In  Part  A,  with  the  exception  of  1  subject  (Subject),  all  subjects  had  a  reduction  in  ventilation 
defect  volume  relative  to Day  15  following  treatment  with  VX-770.  While  ventilation  defects  were 
not  completely  eliminated,  use  of  this  absolute  metric  identified  1  subject  who  had  an  especially 
marked reduction such that only approximately 30% of total ventilation defect remained following 
treatment. 
Spearman  correlation  was  calculated  between  the  primary  efficacy  variable  and  each  of  the 
secondary efficacy variables for Part A and Part B. 
In  Part  A,  the  change  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  (%)  by  human  reader  versus 
absolute  change  from  baseline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1  (%)  showed  a  moderate,  negative 
correlation during Day 15 to Day 43 (-0.5238). In Part B, the total ventilation defect (%) by human 
reader versus percent predicted FEV1 (%) showed a moderate, negative correlation (-0.6172) for 
the duration of 48 weeks. 
Similarly,  the  change  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  (%)  by  human  reader  showed  a 
moderate,  negative  correlation  with  the  change  from  baseline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1  (%)  for 
the duration of 48 weeks (-0.6679). 
In Part A, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human reader versus change 
from baseline in sweat chloride (mmol/L) values showed a weak, positive correlation during Day 15 
to Day 43 (0.0240). In Part B, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human 
reader  versus  change  from  baseline  in  sweat  chloride  (mmol/L)  also  showed  a  weak,  positive 
correlation for the duration of 48 weeks (0.2293). 
In Part A, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human reader versus change 
from baseline in pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score showed a weak, positive correlation during 
Day 15 to Day 43 (0.0976,). In Part B, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by 
human  reader  versus  change  from  baseline  in  pooled  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  score  showed  a 
weak, negative correlation for the duration of 48 weeks (-0.2048).

Safety results 
Overall Summary of Adverse Events 
Part A 
Four (50.0%) subjects had 6 AEs: 3 events during the Placebo Run-in Period and 3 during the VX-
770 Treatment Period. There were no SAEs, no deaths, and no discontinuation of study drug dosing 
due to an AE. None of the AEs reported were considered study drug-related. 
Table 12-4 shows the incidence of all AEs by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) in 
Part A. the SOC with the highest incidence was the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders 
SPC (2 [25.0%] subjects) in the Placebo Run-in Period; however all AEs by PT had an incidence of 
1 (12.5%) subject.

Part B 
Six  (66.7%)  subjects  had  32  AEs;  4  (44.4  %)  subjects  had  AEs  that  were  considered  related  or 
possibly  related  to  the  study  drug.  There  was  1  (11.1%)  subject  with  an  SAE.  There  were  no 
deaths and no discontinuation of study drug dosing due to an AE. 
Table  12-5  shows  the  incidence  of  all  AEs  by  SOC  and  PT  in  Part  B.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest 
incidences  were  infections  and  infestations  (5  [55.6%]  subjects)  and  investigations  (4  [44.4%] 
subjects). The AEs by PT with the highest incidence were upper respiratory tract infection (44.4%), 
infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  CF  (33.3%),  BMI  increased  (22.2%),  abnormal  spirometry 
(22.2%), and pyrexia (22.2%). All other AEs had an incidence of 11.1% (1 subject).

AEs by severity 
There were no life-threatening AEs on either part of this study.  
In part A, there was 1 AE of moderate severity (abdominal distension) and 5 AEs of mild severity 
that occurred in a total of 4 subjects. The 1  AE of  moderate severity occurred during the VX-770 
Treatment Period, it started 3 days after the first dose of VX-770, lasted for 10 days, and resolved 
after treatment with polycarbophil calcium. 
In  part  B,  There  were  18  AEs  of  moderate  severity  in  a  total  of  5  subjects  (infective  pulmonary 
exacerbation  of  CF  [2  out  of  9  subjects];  pyrexia  [2  out  of  9  subjects];  all  other  AEs  [1  out  of  9 
subjects]).  There  was  1  AE  that  was  severe  in  severity:  a  48-year-old  White  male,  had  a  severe 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF that started 249 days after the first dose of VX-770, lasted 
for 49 days, and resolved after intravenous administration of ceftazidime. 
AEs Leading to Discontinuation 
There were no AEs leading to study drug discontinuation on either part of the study.

Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug 
In  this  study,  there  were  7  AEs  in  4  subjects  that  were  considered  possibly  related  to  the  study 
drug (all of them occurred in Part B):  
-  Acute  bronchitis  of  moderate  severity  that  required  treatment  and  was  ongoing  at  the  end  of 
the study. 
-  Acute  labyrinthitis  of  moderate  severity  that  started  275  days  after  the  first  dose  of  VX-770, 
lasted for 5 days, and resolved without treatment. 
- 
- 
Increase in BMI (greater than 10%) of mild severity that was first measured 170 days after the 
first dose of VX-770, lasted for 192 days, and resolved without treatment. 
Increase in BMI (greater than 10%) of mild severity that was first measured 256 days after the 
first dose of VX-770, and was ongoing at the end of the study. 
-  Abnormal decrease in spirometry of mild severity that started 89 days after the first dose of VX-
770, lasted for 85 days, and resolved without treatment. 
-  Upper respiratory tract infection of mild severity that started 344 days after the first dose of VX-
770, lasted for 3 days, and resolved without any treatment. 
-  Abnormal decrease in spirometry of mild severity that started 83 days after the first dose of VX-
770, lasted for 178 days, and resolved without any treatment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  the  clinical  setting,  FEV1  is  currently  the  main  marker  of  lung  function,  since  the  initial 
ventilation  defect  in  CF  is  usually  obstructive.  This  clinical  parameter  is  also  recognized  in  the 
regulatory  setting  as  the  recommended  primary  endpoint  in  CF  trials.  However,  FEV1,  which 
reflects total airways resistance, has some limitations in terms of a lower sensitivity to changes in 
small  calibre  airways,  which  contribute  to  less  than  10%  of  the  overall  resistance  (in  healthy 
lungs).    Additional  difficulties  can  be  identified  to  perform  the  lung  function  assessment  of  young 
children  (especially  those 5  years  of  age  and  younger),  which  require  to  be  carried  in  specialised 
centres  to  promote  standardised  methods.  In  this  context,  it  is  agreed  that  new  and  adequately 
validated methods to measure lung function would be valuable.  
Hyperpolarized  noble  gas  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (HG-MRI)  is  a  method  for  assessing  lung 
function by direct imaging of certain non-radioactive isotopes of an inert noble gas, usually helium 
or  xenon.  This  imaging  technique  provides  high-resolution,  3-dimensional  images  of  lung 
ventilation  that  can  be  obtained  in  both pediatric  and  adult  patients  during  a  single  short  breath-
hold  following  inhalation  of  the  gas.  In  CF  patients,  HG-MRI  images  show  a  “ventilation  defect” 
areas  of  the  lung  into  which  inhaled  gas  does  not  flow  due  to  obstruction  of  the  airway.    This 
ventilation  defect  does  not  usually  show  in  healthy  subjects  and  it  is  thought  to  correlate  with 
disease  severity.  It  can  be  quantified using  both  manual  and  automated  techniques.    In  addition, 
HG-MRI allows magnetic-resonance-specific measures (such as apparent diffusion coefficient) to be 
calculated from the data. 
HG-MRI  is  a  novel,  yet  experimental,  method  to  assess  lung  function  must  be  properly  validated 
before  being  considered  as  a  basis  for  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  CF  paediatric  and  adult 
patients.   
Efficacy 
Study  VX10-770-107  was  a  phase  2,  single-blind,  placebo-controlled  study    which  evaluated  the 
short-term/long-term effect of ivacaftor on hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging in 
subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/534823/2015

Design & conduct of the study 
The  study  was  conducted  in  a  single  centre  in  the  USA  and  took  place  from  October  2010  to 
February 2013.  
Subjects  aged  ≥12  years  with  the  G551D-cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  conductance  regulator 
gene  (CFTR)  mutation  (on  at  least  1  allele)  were  allowed  to  enrol.  No  formal  sample  size 
calculations were performed and the sample size was selected based on operational considerations. 
This  approach  can  be  accepted,  considering  the  low  prevalence  of  the  disease  and  the  selected 
CFTR  mutation.  However,  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with  small  sample  sizes  need  to  be 
acknowledged. 
The primary objectives of the study were to assess the short-term (28 days, part A) and long-term 
(48 weeks, part B) effects of ivacaftor on He-MRI, in order to explore the possibility of using this 
imaging technique as a potential biomarker of lung function in CF studies.   
Efficacy data & additional analyses 
A  total  of  17  patients  were  included  (8  in  phase  A,  and  9  in  phase  B),  of  which  only  4  were 
pediatric patients (age range 12-16). In term of overall results, correlation between the changes in 
ventilation defect and clinical endpoints was considered modest. 
Only global results, including all subjects (pediatric and adult) have been provided and no separate 
results are available for the pediatric subjects in this study. It is acknowledged that the number of 
pediatric  patients  included  in  the  study  was  very  small  (n=4)  and  the  applicability  of  the  study 
results would probably be very limited as well. However, the lack of pediatric-specific data hampers 
from  reaching  any  sort  of  conclusion.  Therefore,  the  MAH  is  asked  to  provide  pediatric  data 
separately from the global study results. Efficacy as well as safety results should be provided. 
Safety 
In general, ivacaftor seemed to be well tolerated during study VX10-770-107. There were no life-
threatening AEs or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation on either part of this study.  
In part A, the SOC with the highest incidence of AEs was the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders  SOC  (2  [25.0%]  subjects).  A  total  of  4  (50.0%)  subjects  had  6  AEs,  none  of  them 
considered study drug-related. 
In  part  B,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidences  were  infections  and  infestations  (5  [55.6%] 
subjects)  and  investigations  (4  [44.4%]  subjects).  A  total  of  6  (66.7%)  subjects  had  32  AEs;  4 
(44.4  %)  subjects  had  AEs  that  were  considered  related  or  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug  (1 
acute  bronchitis  AE,  1  acute  labyrinthitis  AE,  2  increased  BMI  AEs,  2  abnormal  decrease  in 
spirometry  AEs,  and  one  upper  respiratory  infection    AE).  There  was  1  (11.1%)  subject  with  an 
SAE.  
The  overall  safety  profile  observed  in  study  VX10-770-107was  consistent  with  that  observed  in 
previous studies for CF subjects with G551D mutation on 1 allele.  However, pediatric data has not 
been provided separately from the global study results. Therefore, no conclusion on pediatric safety 
can be reached and additional information is needed from the MAH.

3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
From the provided data, no conclusions can be reached on the effect of ivacaftor on hyperpolarized 
helium-3  magnetic  resonance  imaging  in  pediatric  subjects  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF).  Considering 
that the  aim  of  this  procedure  is  to  specifically  assess  pediatric  data,  the  provided  results  (global 
results  only)  do  not  allow  performing  an  adequate  assessment.  The  MAH  is  asked  to  provide 
pediatric data separately from the global study results. Efficacy as well as safety results should be 
provided (see further details in the next section).

Primary Endpoint 
The mean (standard deviation) (SD) change in total ventilation defect from Day 15 to Day 43 (for 
paediatric subjects) was -6.47% (6.478%) when analyzed by human reader. A similar change for 
these subjects -9.72% (4.804%) was observed when analyzed using the ventilation segmentation 
algorithm (Table 1). The mean change in total ventilation defect for paediatric subjects was slightly 
less  than  that  determined  for  adult  subjects  (-9.23%  [10.844%]  by  human  reader  and  -14.67% 
[12.396] by ventilation segmentation algorithm. Over the 4 weeks of VX-770 treatment, the total 
ventilation  defect  as  well as  total  defect  volume,  total  lung  volume,  and  total  number of  subjects 
showed  a  decrease  in  both  paediatric  and  adult  subjects  (exception  being  the  mean  change  from 
Day  15  to  Day  29)  in  total  ventilation  defect  and  total  defect  volume  for  the  paediatric  subjects 
analyzed  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm.  Following  wash-out,  the  total  ventilation  defect 
values  returned  to  pre-treatment  levels  in  both  paediatric  and  adult  subjects.  The  changes  from 
baseline  for  all  parameters  measured  were  not  statistically  significant,  most  likely  because  the 
analysis was limited by the sample sizes.

Secondary Endpoints 
Total  ventilation  defect  was  further  summarized  by  the  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second 
(FEV1) severity. Percent predicted FEV1 in paediatric subjects increased over the 4-week treatment 
period  and  returned  to  pre-treatment  levels  following  placebo  washout.  Similar  results  were 
observed in the adult subjects.

Sweat  chloride  values  in  pediatric  subjects  decreased  over  the  4-week  treatment  period  and 
returned to pretreatment levels following placebo washout (Table 3). Results were similar to those 
observed for adult subjects.

(mmol/L) by Treatment Phase, Pediatric Subjects, Part A  
The mean and median change from baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) 
respiratory domain scores did not change during the Placebo Run-in, indicating that subjects were 
stable during that phase (Table 4). During VX-770 treatment, the mean CFQ-R respiratory domain 
scores  for  pediatric  subjects  decreased  through  4  weeks  of  treatment,  while  the  mean  CFQ-R 
scores for adult subjects did not change during VX-770 treatment. Interpretation of these results is 
confounded  because  the  mean  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  score  during  the  VX-770  Treatment 
Period may have been influenced by a small number of outlying values and the small sample size.

Primary Endpoint 
The  changes  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  (Table  5)  were  generally  greater  in  the 
pediatric  subgroup  than  the  adult  subgroup,  though  they  typically  followed  the  same  pattern  as 
those observed in the adult subgroup and were consistent with those observed in Part A; however, 
analysis is limited by the sample size of the subgroups.

Secondary Endpoints 
The mean percent predicted FEV1 increased from baseline and remained fairly constant throughout 
the 48-week treatment period for the pediatric subgroup as well as the adult subgroup (Table 6). 
In both subgroups, FEV1 values returned to baseline following completion of study treatment at the 
Week 52 Safety Follow-up Visit.

The  mean  sweat  chloride  values  (Table  7)  decreased  from  baseline  and  remained  constant 
throughout the 48-week treatment period for the pediatric subgroup as well as the adult subgroup. 
In  both  subgroups,  sweat  chloride  values  returned  to  baseline  following  completion  of  study 
treatment at the Week 52 Follow-up Visit.

period as well as at the Week 52 Safety Follow-up Visit (Table 8); scores at the Week 48 and Week 
52 Visits were reported by a single pediatric subject. The mean CFQ-R score for the adult subjects 
was  similarly  increased  from  baseline  and  remained  constant  over  the  48-week  treatment  period 
but returned to baseline levels at the Week 52 Follow-up Visit.

For  the  most  part,  given  the  small  sample  size  of  the  subgroups,  the  results  for  the  paediatric 
subjects in this study are consistent with the results obtained for the adult subjects as well as the 
overall study population in both Part A (Table 9) and Part B (Table 10), indicating that the overall 
treatment effect of VX-770 was similar across the age groups.

CHMP comments  
Separate efficacy results for the 4 paediatric patients have been provided, as requested. 
Changes from baseline for all the studied parameters were not statistically significant, and it can be 
agreed with the Applicant that this fact is likely due to the very small sample size. In addition, as 
previously  noted  for  the  overall  results,  the  correlation  between  the  changes  in  ventilation  defect 
and clinical endpoints in paediatric patients seems to be very modest. 
Paediatric results generally show the same trends that overall and adults results.  In general, the 
sizes  of  the  observed  results  varied  from  paediatric  to  adult  patients;  however,  these  differences 
are  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  small  number  of  paediatric  patients.  Overall,  no  large  or 
worrisome differences are noted between paediatric and adult results. No additional information is 
being requested at this time. 
In  conclusion,  the  requested  information  has  been  provided.  In  that  regard,  the  issue  can  be 
considered solved.  
Question2 
2a. An appropriate description of safety in the paediatric patients should be provided. An 
overall  description  as well  as separate  information  for  each  part of  the  study  should  be 
provided. 
2b. Patients’ demographic and disease characteristics should also be provided separately 
for the paediatric patients. 
2c. Special attention should be paid to the one SAE and the drug-related AEs reported in 
the study. The MAH should clarify if these AEs occurred in paediatric patients, and should 
provide a brief description of the AEs, including demographic and disease characteristics 
of these patients. 
MAH’s response  
2.a. 
A total of 4 paediatric subjects were enrolled in this study, 3 in Part A and 2  in Part B; 1 subject 
was enrolled in both Parts A and B (Part A as Subject; Part B as Subject). The overall safety profile 
was  assessed  in  terms  of  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE),  clinical

laboratory values, electrocardiogram outcomes, and vital signs. These data were summarized using 
descriptive  statistics  and  contingency  tables.  All  individual  paediatric  subject  data  were  presented 
in subject data listings. 
Part A:  
Of  the  8  subjects  enrolled  in  Part  A,  3  were  paediatric  (<18  years  of  age).  Only  one  of  the  3 
paediatric subjects had a TEAE (Subject; 14-year-old male), a non-serious event of mild CF lung, 
which  was  considered  unlikely  related  to  study  drug.  Of  the  remaining  2  paediatric  subjects, 
neither had a TEAE; one (Subject ; 12-year-old male) did not have any adverse events (AEs) and 
the other (Subject ; 15-year-old female) had 2 pre-treatment AEs (events of pain [not related] and 
oropharyngeal pain [unlikely related]) during the Placebo Run-in. 
Part B:  
Of the 9 subjects enrolled in Part B, 2 were paediatric (Subjects and). Subject (13-year-old male) 
was  also  enrolled  in  Part  A  (as  Subject)  and  did  not  have  an  AE  in  Part  B  of  the  study.  Subject 
completed  his  Week  48  Visit,  then  withdrew  consent,  and  did  not  complete  the  Safety  Follow-up 
Visit. 
Subject  (16-year-old  male)  had  6  TEAEs  in  Part  B  (events  of  nausea,  pain,  pyrexia  [2  events], 
pharyngitis streptococcal, and upper respiratory tract infection). All of the TEAEs were non serious, 
mild to moderate in severity, considered not related or unlikely related to study drug, and resolved. 
Subject completed the 48-week VX-770 treatment.

2.c. 
One  subject  (Subject),  a  48-year-old  White  male  with  G551D/  G551D,  had  an  SAE  of  infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF in Part B of the study.  
There were no AEs reported as related to study drug in Part A for any subject (pediatric or adult). 
In Part B, 4 subjects had 7 AEs that were considered possibly related to study drug, all were mild 
in  severity  unless  noted  and  no  events  were  considered  related;  none  of  these  subjects  were 
pediatric subjects. 
-  Subject  (26-year-old  white  female)  had  3  AEs  that  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
possibly  related  to  study  treatment  (bronchitis,  labyrinthitis,  and  body  mass  index  [BMI] 
increased).  The  events  of  labyrinthitis  and  BMI  increased,  both  moderate  in  severity,  resolved 
during the study. The event of bronchitis occurred 344 days from first dose and had not resolved 
by the end of study. 
-  Subject (22-year-old white female) had 1 AE that was assessed by the investigator as possibly 
related to study treatment (spirometry abnormal). This event resolved while on study treatment. 
-  Subject (31-year-old white male) had 2 AEs that were assessed by the investigator as possibly 
related  to  study  treatment  (upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  spirometry  abnormal).  Both 
events resolved while on study treatment. 
-  Subject  (48-year-old  white  male)  had  1  AE  that  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  possibly 
related to study treatment (BMI increased). This event occurred 256 days from first dose and had 
not resolved by the end of study.

2.a, 
Of the 3 paediatric patients enrolled in part A, only one reported a treatment-related AE, which was 
mild  in  intensity  and  considered  unlikely  related  with  study  treatment.  In  part  B,  one  of  the  2 
paediatric  patients  included  experienced  a  total  of  6  treatment-related  AEs,  of  mild-to-moderate 
intensity and considered not related-unlikely related to study treatment. The other patient did not 
experience any AEs or SAEs and did not complete the Safety follow-up visit.  
In general, these data does not seem to differ with the overall population safety data and no new 
concerns have been identified. 
2.b.  
The requested information has been provided. Bearing in mind that the sample size is very small, 
the  patients  included  can  be  considered  representative  of  CF  paediatric  patients,  in  terms  of 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics. 
2.c.   
No SAEs or treatment-related AEs were reported in paediatric patients on either part of the study.  
This  is  considered  reassuring,  although  the  limitations  derived  from  the  small  sample  size  are 
acknowledged.  
In  conclusion,  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified  in  paediatric  patients  included  in  study 
107.  
Issue considered solved.  
5.  CHMP’s updated  overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
As a response to the CHMP´s request for additional information, the MAH has submitted separate 
data  from  paediatric  patients  included  in  study  VX10-770-107,  a  phase  2,  single-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study    which  evaluated  the  short-term/long-term  effect  of  ivacaftor  on  hyperpolarized 
helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging (HG-MRI) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).  
In  terms  of  efficacy,  changes  from  baseline  for  all  the  studied  parameters  were  not  statistically 
significant in paediatric patients, likely due to the very small sample size. In addition, as previously 
noted for the overall results, the correlation between the changes in ventilation defect and clinical 
endpoints in paediatric patients seems to be very modest. 
Paediatric efficacy results generally showed the same trends that the overall and adults results.  In 
general, the sizes of the observed effects varied from paediatric to adult patients; however, these 
differences  are  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  small  number  of  paediatric  patients.  Overall,  no 
large or worrisome differences in efficacy are noted between paediatric and adult results.  
Regarding  to  safety,  very  few  AEs  reported  in  paediatric  patients,  most  of  them  mild  in  intensity 
and considered not related/unlikely related to the study treatment.  No SAEs or treatment-related 
AEs were reported in paediatric patients on either part of the study.  This is considered reassuring, 
although the limitations derived from the small sample size are acknowledged.  
In general, these data does not seem to differ with the overall population safety data and no new 
concerns or safety signals have been identified. 
Overall conclusion 
The number of paediatric patients included in study VX10-770-107 was very small. Results do not 
indicate  large  differences  with  those  from  the  overall  and  adult  population.  As  a  result  of  the 
limited sample size, the applicability of the study results is considered very limited as well.  
In  conclusion,  paediatric  data  from  study  VX10-770-107  does  not  change  the  B/R  of  Kalydeco 
(ivacaftor) in the currently approved indication. Therefore, further actions regarding the conditions 
of use and the product information are not required at this time.

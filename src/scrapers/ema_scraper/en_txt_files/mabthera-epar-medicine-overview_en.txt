MabThera (rituximab) 
An overview of MabThera and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is MabThera and what is it used for? 
MabThera is a medicine used to treat the following blood cancers and inflammatory conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (two types of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, a blood cancer); 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, another blood cancer affecting white blood cells); 
severe rheumatoid arthritis (an inflammatory condition of the joints); 
two inflammatory conditions of blood vessels known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA or 
Wegener’s granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); 
•  moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disease characterised by widespread 
blistering and erosion of the skin and mucous membranes (the linings of internal organs). 
‘Autoimmune’ means that the disease is caused by the immune system (the body’s natural 
defences) attacking the body’s own cells. 
Depending on the condition it is used to treat, MabThera may be given on its own, or with 
chemotherapy, methotrexate or a corticosteroid.  
MabThera contains the active substance rituximab. 
How is MabThera used? 
MabThera is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein. Patients with blood cancers can switch to an 
injection given under the skin after they have received one full dose of the infusion. 
Before each infusion or injection, the patient should be given an antihistamine (to prevent allergic 
reactions) and an anti-pyretic (a medicine for fever). Depending on the condition being treated, the 
patients can also be given other medicines.  
MabThera can only be obtained with a prescription. It should be given under the close supervision of 
an experienced healthcare professional and in an environment where facilities for resuscitating patients 
are immediately available.

How does MabThera work? 
The active substance in MabThera, rituximab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) designed to 
attach to a protein called CD20 present on B-lymphocytes. When rituximab attaches to CD20, it causes 
the death of B-lymphocytes, which helps in lymphoma and CLL (where B-lymphocytes have become 
cancerous) and in rheumatoid arthritis (where B-lymphocytes are involved in joint inflammation). In 
GPA and MPA, destroying the B-lymphocytes lowers the production of antibodies thought to play an 
important role in attacking the blood vessels and causing inflammation. 
What benefits of MabThera have been shown in studies? 
Studies show MabThera to be effective in treating all the conditions for which it is approved. Some 
results from the main studies on the benefits of MabThera are described below. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In a follicular lymphoma study involving 322 patients, patients receiving MabThera in addition to 
chemotherapy lived for an average of 25.9 months without the disease coming back, compared 
with 6.7 months in those receiving chemotherapy alone. 
In a study of MabThera given on its own (203 patients), 48% of the patients with follicular 
lymphoma who had failed previous treatment responded to MabThera. 
In a maintenance study in patients whose follicular lymphoma had come back after previous 
treatment, patients who received MabThera alone lived for an average of 42.2 months without the 
disease getting worse, compared with 14.3 months in patients who did not receive the medicine. A 
maintenance study in previously untreated patients showed the likelihood for the disease to get 
worse was reduced by 50% for patients who received MabThera. 
In a study of 399 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, patients adding MabThera to 
chemotherapy lived for an average of 35 months without the disease getting worse or the need for 
a change in treatment, compared with 13 months in those receiving chemotherapy alone. 
In a study of 817 patients with CLL, patients who had not been treated before lived for an average 
of 39.8 months without their disease getting worse when they received MabThera in addition to 
chemotherapy, compared with 32.2 months in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In patients 
whose disease had come back after previous treatment, those receiving MabThera lived for 30.6 
months without their disease getting worse, compared with 20.6 months in those receiving 
chemotherapy alone. 
In a study of 517 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, MabThera was more effective than placebo: 
51% of the patients receiving MabThera had an improvement in symptoms, compared with 18% of 
the patients receiving placebo. 
In a study of 198 patients with GPA or MPA, 64% of patients given MabThera were in complete 
remission after six months, compared with 55% given cyclophosphamide, a comparator medicine. 
A second study in 117 patients looked at the proportion of patients whose condition came back 
within 28 months. The study showed that only 5% of patients treated with MabThera had a 
relapse, compared with 29% of patients treated with azathioprine (another medicine used to treat 
GPA and MPA). 
• 
In a study of 90 patients newly diagnosed with pemphigus, rituximab in combination with 
prednisone (a corticosteroid) was shown to be more effective than prednisone alone at clearing

skin lesions. Following 2 years of treatment, 90% of patients treated with MabThera and short-
term (up to 6 months) prednisone were in complete remission (meaning that skin and mucosa had 
healed and there were no new or old lesions) after stopping prednisone for 2 months or more, 
compared with 28% of patients treated with prednisone alone. 
What is the risk associated with MabThera? 
The most common side effects with MabThera intravenous infusions are reactions related to the 
infusion (such as fever, chills and shivering) while most common serious side effects are infusion 
reactions, infections and heart-related problems. Similar side effects are seen when MabThera is 
injected under the skin, with the exception of reactions around the injections site (pain, swelling and 
rash), which occur more frequently with the skin injections. For the full list of side effects of MabThera, 
see the package leaflet. 
MabThera must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to rituximab, mouse proteins or 
any of the other ingredients or in patients with a severe infection or a severely weakened immune 
system. The formulation injected under the skin must also not be used in patients who are allergic to a 
substance called hyaluronidase. 
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, GPA, MPA or pemphigus must not receive MabThera if they have 
severe heart problems. 
Why is MabThera authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency decided that MabThera’s benefits are greater than its risks and 
recommended that it be given marketing authorisation. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
MabThera? 
The company marketing MabThera will provide doctors and patients using the medicine for rheumatoid 
arthritis, GPA, MPA or pemphigus with educational material on the risk of infection including of a rare 
severe infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). These patients are also 
to receive an alert card, which they are to carry at all times, instructing them to contact their doctor 
immediately if they experience symptoms of infection. 
All doctors administering MabThera under the skin will also receive educational material to minimise 
the risk of improper use or errors. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of MabThera have also been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of MabThera are continuously monitored. Side effects reported 
with MabThera are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.

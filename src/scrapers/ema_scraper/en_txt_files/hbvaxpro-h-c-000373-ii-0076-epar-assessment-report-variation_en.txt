1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, MSD Vaccins submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 18 February 2022 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.3.z  
C.I.3.z - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR

or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 
45/46 - Other variation 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in relation to the duration of protection over 9 years (re-challenge) 
in healthy subjects following procedure EMEA/H/C/000373/P46/061. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the SmPC, Labelling and 
the Package Leaflet.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling 
and Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
HBVAXPRO is a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine that was approved in the EU for active immunization 
against hepatitis B virus infection in individuals from birth to 15 years of age considered at risk of 
exposure to hepatitis B virus. 
HBVAXPRO is administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection in a 3- (0, 1, 6 months) or 4-dose (0, 
1, 2, 12 months) infant vaccination primary series, depending on local recommendations. One dose 
(0.5 mL) contains Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, recombinant (HBsAg) 5 µg, adsorbed on 
amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.25 mg). 
To date, the duration of protective immune responses has not been established for primary series of 
HBVAXPRO. 
During EMEA/H/C/000373/P46/061 procedure the CHMP recommended that, based on the data of 
V419-013 submitted, section 5.1 of the SmPC of HBVAXPRO be amended to incorporate the duration of 
protection over 9 years (re-challenge) in healthy subjects. 
Since study V419-013 concerns the primary dose series of Vaxelis® rather than HBVAXPRO, the MAH 
proposed to revise the sentence from “As with other hepatitis B vaccines, the duration of the protective 
effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present” to “The duration of the protective effect in healthy 
vaccinees is unknown”. 
Overall, the proposed changes to the Product Information (section 5.1) are considered scientifically 
justified. The difference between HBVAXPRO and Vaxelis (a vaccine for DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib, received 8-9 
years before), in terms of HBsAg contents and dose schedules, supports the MAH proposal not to 
incorporate the 9-year persistence data of V419-013 study in the HBVAXPRO SmPC 5.1. 
The benefit-risk balance of HBVAXPRO remains positive.

3.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in relation to study V419-013, following procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000373/P46/061. The sentence “As with other hepatitis B vaccines, the duration of the 
protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present” was revised to “The duration of the 
protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown”. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the SmPC, Labelling and 
the Package Leaflet.  
is recommended for approval. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB are 
recommended.

4.  Introduction 
Background on the product: 
HBVAXPRO is a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine that was approved in EU for active immunization 
against hepatitis B virus infection in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of 
exposure to hepatitis B virus. 
HBVAXPRO is administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection in a 3- (0, 1, 6 months) or 4-dose (0, 
1, 2, 12 months) infant vaccination primary series, depending on local recommendations. One dose 
(0.5 mL) contains Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, recombinant (HBsAg) 5 µg, adsorbed on 
amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.25 mg). 
The duration of protective effect of HBVAXPRO primary dose series has not yet been established. 
•  Background on the study V419-013 
V419-013 was a single-group, open-label, single-dose, and multi-site study to evaluate the long-term 
durability of the immune protection against HBV infection approximately 9 years after receipt of a 
primary Vaxelis® immunization series. Participants had previously participated in studies V419-007 or 
V419-008 and received Vaxelis® according to a 3 + 1 (at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age) or a 2 + 1 (at 
2, 4, and 11 to 12 months of age) schedule, respectively. They were 8 to 10 years of age at Protocol 
V419-013 enrollment and received a single intramuscular dose (5 µg dose) of HBVAXPRO. The trial 
was conducted under GCP. 
V419-013 was assessed during EMEA/H/C/000373/P46/061 procedure. 
•  Purpose of the Variation and Proposed changes to the Product Information: 
The submission of this variation was triggered by the outcome of EMEA/H/C/000373/P46/061 
procedure, that related to the paediatric study V419-013. 
The MAH argued that duration of protection has been assessed in some hepatitis B vaccines, but it has 
not been assessed specifically for HBVAXPRO. The V419-013 study utilizes a HBVAXPRO challenge to 
demonstrate the durability of protection against hepatitis B virus infection in healthy children 
vaccinated about 9 years previously with Vaxelis. The HBsAg content and administrations schedules 
differ significantly between Vaxelis and HBVAXPRO and data generated by the V419-013 study does 
not inform the duration of the immune memory conferred by HBVAXPRO when administered as a 
primary series. The sentence above has therefore been adjusted to more accurately reflect what is 
known for HBVAXPRO which is that the duration of the protective effect of HBVAXPRO is unknown.

Assessor’s comments: 
The proposed changes to the Product Information (section 5.1) are scientifically justified. 
The difference between HBVAXPRO and Vaxelis, in terms of HBsAg contents and dose schedules, 
supports the MAH approach to not incorporating the 9-year persistence data of V419-013 study in the 
HBVAXPRO SmPC 5.1. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
Update  of  section  5.1  of 
the  SmPC 
in 
relation 
to  duration  of  protection 
following 
EMEA/H/C/000373/P46/061 procedure. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update some other sections of the product information: 
−  Editorial changes such as a change from ml to mL (Annex I, Annex IIIA, Annex IIIB) (alignment with 
Compilation of QRD decisions on stylistic matters in product information) 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

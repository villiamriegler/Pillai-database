2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Apixaban is a selective, orally active inhibitor of coagulation factor X [FXa] that is being co-developed 
by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and Pfizer as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic agent. Apixaban (also 
referred to as BMS-562247), is a reversible and highly potent inhibitor of human FXa, with an inhibitor 
constant (Ki) of 0.08 ± 0.01 nM, and a high degree of selectivity over other coagulation proteases and 
structurally related enzymes involved in digestion and fibrinolysis.

Pharmacotherapeutic action 
FXa occupies a pivotal role in the clotting cascade, converting prothrombin to thrombin (FIIa). 
Thrombin has multiple functions, converting fibrinogen to fibrin, promoting fibrin cross-linking by 
activating factor XIII, providing positive feedback activation of coagulation by activating factors V, VIII, 
and XI, activating the protein C anticoagulant pathway, and activating thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis 
inhibitor (TAFI) to protect the clot from premature degradation (Figure 1). Thrombin is also a powerful 
platelet agonist, activating platelets and recruiting additional platelets into the platelet-rich thrombus. 
FXa inhibition decreases conversion of prothrombin to active thrombin, thereby diminishing fibrin 
formation, and reducing coagulation and platelet activation. Unlike unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-
molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux, each of which acts through an antithrombin 
(AT)-mediated mechanism, apixaban directly inhibits FXa. Compared with UFH, LMWHs (including 
enoxaparin) have relatively more effect on inhibiting FXa than FIIa, while the pentasaccharide, 
fondaparinux, selectively inhibits FXa. 
Figure 1: The haemostatic pathway and site of action of inhibitors of activated factor X 
(FXa). FXa occupies a central position in the pathway, converting prothrombin (FII) to 
thrombin (FIIa). Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin. 
Approved indications 
Apixaban is currently approved for preventing VTE in adults following elective knee or hip replacement 
surgery at a dose of 2.5 mg BID in the EU and other countries and for reducing the risk of stroke or 
systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular AF at a dose of 5 mg BID.

Problem statement  
The following new indication is proposed by the MAH: 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). 
The proposed dose regimen is: 
• 
• 
For the treatment of DVT and PE, 10 mg taken orally twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg 
taken orally twice daily. 
In patients requiring treatment for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, 2.5 mg taken orally 
twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE. 
The clinical development program for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults included 1 Phase 2 study (CV185017) 
and 2 Phase 3 studies (CV18506 and CV18507;  
Disease background 
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a common name to denote diseases related to DVT or PE. 
Thrombosis is a pathological process by which blood clots form within the lumen of arteries, veins, or 
the chambers of the heart. In the venous circulation, thrombosis in the large veins of the legs, pelvis, 
or arms is referred to as DVT. The most common anatomical site of a DVT is the venous system of the 
lower limb. DVT may result in pain and swelling of the affected limbs, but is often asymptomatic. Any 
episode of DVT, whether symptomatic or not, significantly increases the risk of further VTE, and may 
lead to a PE or post-thrombotic syndrome that includes venous ulceration, debilitating pain, and 
intractable oedema. 
PE is a clot within the lung vasculature that results from embolisation of a DVT, most often from the 
proximal veins of the legs. PE may occur together with a DVT or may occur in the absence of 
symptoms of DVT. Patients with symptomatic DVT also often have silent PE. In DVT treatment studies, 
it has been demonstrated that the majority of patients with symptomatic proximal DVT, but without 
symptoms of PE, have perfusion deficits on lung scanning. Thus, DVT and PE are manifestations of the 
same disease with serious and potential fatal outcomes. 
PE is the most serious complication of DVT, as the embolised blood clot lodges in the lung vasculature 
and obstructs blood flow through the lungs. This reduces oxygenation of the blood and increases 
mechanical strain on the heart, leading to cardiopulmonary compromise, which has a high risk of 
death. If a large thrombus acutely obstructs the pulmonary vasculature, sudden death is a common 
outcome, with approximately 300,000 deaths reported annually in the US, a number that exceeds that 
of deaths from myocardial infarction (MI) (170,000/year) and stroke (158,000/year). 
VTE is a common disorder, with literature reports of > 900,000 VTE events annually in the US and > 1 
million VTE events annually in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK combined. Thus, VTE 
is a major health problem worldwide, and as the population ages, mortality and morbidity resulting 
from PE and DVT will increasingly contribute to significant clinical and health-related problems. 
VTE may be associated with an identifiable and reversible risk factor, such as surgery, trauma, or 
prolonged immobilization. These cases are considered to be provoked VTEs, and usually occur within 3 
months of the associated risk factor. Unprovoked VTE is associated with no such identifiable risk 
factors. Many patients with unprovoked VTE are found, subsequent to their diagnosis, to have 
conditions that result in a higher risk for recurrence, such as active cancer or thrombophilia. The rate 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 9/104 
 
 
 
 
 
of recurrent VTE is higher in unprovoked VTE, 10% reported after 1 year compared to only 1% after 1 
year in provoked VTE. 
Current Standard of Care, Available Therapies, and Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of 
Venous Thromboembolism 
The present standard of care for treatment of DVT is a 2-stage process. The first involves initiation of 
treatment parenterally with UFH, LMWH or the pentasaccharide fondaparinux. The second stage, 
usually begun at the same time as the first, is the initiation of oral dosing with a vitamin K antagonist 
(VKA). Treatment with UFH or LMWH is continued until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved with the 
VKA, as evidenced by an INR above 2.0. At this point parenteral therapy is discontinued and oral 
therapy with the VKA (target range: 2.0 ≤ INR ≤ 3.0) is continued for a duration that depends upon 
the clinical setting. 
The therapeutic goals in managing patients with VTE are 2-fold: 1) stabilize the thrombus in the acute 
episode to facilitate its degradation by the endogenous fibrinolytic system, and 2) prevent recurrence 
or new episodes of VTE. 
VKAs have a narrow therapeutic window, and so dosing must be individualized, which requires gradual 
titration to achieve and maintain a therapeutic level. This requires frequent INR monitoring. In 
addition, VKAs suffer from significant drug-drug and drug-food interactions, which can result in INR 
levels that fall below or exceed the optimal therapeutic level. As a result, treatment with VKAs requires 
constant diligence with respect to compliance, INR monitoring, concomitant drug use and diet in order 
to achieve and maintain a level of anticoagulation that is efficacious and has an acceptable bleeding 
risk. As such, the complexity of warfarin dosing contributes to it being the medication most commonly 
implicated in emergency admissions for adverse drug events in patients ≥ 65 years old, based on a 
survey performed in 58 non-paediatric hospitals in the US. Warfarin-related adverse events (AEs) 
accounted for approximately one-third of these hospitalizations and it has been estimated that 
hospitalizations for warfarin-related haemorrhages in the US exceed 20,000 cases annually. 
The recently published “concept paper on the need for revision of the guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products for the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease (CPMP/EWP/563/98)” 
indicates that the current clinical practice guidelines make a distinction between acute treatment 
(usually the first 7 days), long-term treatment (from day 7 to 3 months) and extended treatment of 
VTE (from 3 months to indefinite). VTE events are classified as either unprovoked (or idiopathic) or 
provoked (secondary to a transient or reversible cause, such as surgery, recent immobilisation or 
trauma). 
Published evidence indicates that in patients with VTE provoked by a transient risk factor such as 
surgery, the risk of recurrent VTE after 3-6 months of effective anticoagulant therapy is approximately 
50% lower compared to patients who had an unprovoked (idiopathic) VTE. This lower risk of 
recurrence with provoked VTE has resulted in a recommendation by all current treatment guidelines 
(American College of Chest Physician (ACCP), National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC)) to discontinue anticoagulation after 3 months of treatment for 
patients who have a VTE provoked by a transient risk factor and do not have an on-going risk factor 
for recurrence. However, in patients with unprovoked VTE and a low or moderate risk for bleeding, 
treatment beyond 3 months is recommended based on an individual patient’s risk for bleeding. The 
recommended anticoagulant treatment doses are the same for VTE events, regardless of whether the 
event was provoked or unprovoked. This recommendation is driven by evidence which demonstrated 
that the cumulative incidence of VTE recurrence in such a population was 11% within 1 year after 
discontinuing anticoagulant therapy, 29% within 5 years, and 40% within 10 years.

Although current guidelines support extending anticoagulant therapy in patients with unprovoked VTE 
until the risk of recurrent VTE no longer outweighs the risk of bleeding or until the patient wishes to 
stop treatment (even if the patient’s risk of recurrence outweighs the increase in bleeding), an exact 
duration is not specified. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacology: 
Apixaban inhibits free factor Xa (FXa) as well as thrombus-associated FXa and FXa within the 
prothrombinase complex. Unlike the indirect inhibitors of FXa, apixaban does not require antithrombin 
III to inhibit FXa. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban reduces directly tissue factor-induced thrombin 
generation and indirectly thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation, suggesting that it may prevent and 
treat both venous as well as arterial thrombosis. The major circulating metabolite of apixaban, O-
desmethyl apixaban sulfate, does not significantly inhibit human FXa. 
Primary pharmacodynamic data provided in the original MAA showed that in diabetic/obese mice and in 
a broad range of experimental models of thrombosis in rabbits, rats, and dogs, apixaban demonstrated 
antithrombotic efficacy at doses that resulted in modest changes in standard coagulation assays. 
Substantial prevention of both venous and arterial thrombosis was achieved at apixaban doses that 
produced minor changes in bleeding times, while higher doses resulted in more pronounced increases 
in clotting times and bleeding times. Apixaban also effectively inhibited the growth of a preformed 
intravascular thrombus. 
Secondary and safety pharmacology data revealed no concern of adverse secondary pharmacodynamic 
or other adverse effects related to its pharmacological action. 
In rabbits, the combination of apixaban with aspirin and/or clopidogrel significantly enhanced 
antithrombotic activity without excessive increases in bleeding time.  
(For more details of the pharmacological studies, see the EPAR of the first MAA (2011)). 
Pharmacokinetics: 
In vitro studies with excised segments of rat duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, showed that 
apixaban is absorbed throughout the rat intestinal tract. The permeability coefficient in the jejunum 
provided evidence for involvement of an intestinal efflux transport mechanism. 
A range of in vitro studies in monolayers of Caco-2 cells expressing a number of efflux transporters 
including P-gp and BCRP, porcine kidney-derived cells (LLC-PK1) transfected with P-gp transporters, 
canine kidney-derived (MDCKII) cells transfected with BCRP transporters, indicated that apixaban is a 
substrate for both P-gp and BCRP, and it is not transported by MRP or OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 transporters. These active transport mechanisms may play a role in the limited 
bioavailability after oral administration of apixaban. In addition, evidence was found for paracellular 
transport. At high doses, absorption may also be limited by dissolution rate. 
Elimination half-life in rats (2-3 hrs) was shorter than in dogs (5-6 hrs) and chimpanzees. Distribution 
volume was relatively low in rats (0.31 L/kg), dogs (0.30 L/kg) and chimpanzees (0.17 L/kg). 
Clearance (rat 4.3 ml/min/kg, dog 0.87 ml/min/kg, chimpanzee 0.30 ml/min/kg) was low (10, 2 and 
1% respectively) compared to hepatic blood flow.

In toxicokinetic studies, exposure increased less than dose-proportional. At high doses and in dietary 
studies exposure hardly increased with increasing dose.  
Protein binding differs between the species. The unbound fraction at concentrations of 1-10 μM is 
about 13% in human vs about 4% in rats and 8% in dogs.  
Single dose radiolabel distribution studies in rats showed a wide distribution, with the highest values in 
excretory organs (liver, kidney, urinary bladder (and contents), bile) and intestinal tract (and 
contents). Distribution in pregnant rats/foetuses showed significant foetal exposure with foetal plasma 
levels mostly lower than maternal levels. Pregnant rats showed a high Cmax in mammary gland. 
Concentrations of apixaban in rat milk exceed those in blood and plasma. The high concentration in 
milk vs plasma suggested involvement of active transport (possibly BCRP transporter). Elimination half 
life from rat milk, blood and plasma was similar. 
Apixaban is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4/5 with conjugation via SULT1A1, but several other CYP and 
SULT isozymes are also involved. There were no apixaban metabolites with pharmacological activity. 
There were no unique human metabolites. 
After single oral administration of radiolabelled apixaban to intact male mice, male rats, female rabbits 
or male dogs, most of the dose was excreted in faeces and most of the remainder of the dose in urine. 
Bile-duct cannulated rats eliminated part of the dose by the biliary route (about 3% over a 48 hr 
period after oral gavage). After intravenous infusion intact male rats or female rabbits excreted a 
larger part into urine. Intravenously treated bile-duct cannulated rats excreted even more into urine 
(47% in 24 hrs) and also a large part into bile (23% in 24 hrs). Most of the faecally and urinary 
eliminated material consists of parent compound. A large part of the faecally cleared material was 
probably unabsorbed apixaban. Secretion of apixaban and metabolites into the intestine was most 
likely due to excretion via P-glycoprotein. 
Apixaban is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP. Inhibition was only observed at concentrations 25 times 
the maximal observed human plasma concentrations. Apixaban did not affect the absorption of drugs 
that are P-glycoprotein substrates. Since apixaban is a substrate for CYP3A4/5, BCRP, and P-
glycoprotein, co-administration of drugs that modulate their activities could affect the absorption and 
disposition of apixaban. However, the relatively low dependence of apixaban on metabolic clearance for 
its elimination and the multiple pathways available for apixaban elimination (renal and biliary clearance 
and, possibly, intestinal secretion) suggests that any such effects are likely to be of relatively low 
magnitude. Since apixaban is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter, its absorption may be 
affected by P-glycoprotein inhibitors.  
With the first line extension application (2012) two in vitro studies were provided, showing an 
inhibiting effect of diltiazem on digoxin efflux in Caco- 2 cells and in porcine kidney-derived LLC-PK1 
cell monolayers. Based on these data it was concluded that diltiazem is an inhibitor of P-gp. 
In fasted beagle dogs (first MAA), bioavailability of apixaban was reduced (up to 50%) by active 
charcoal treatment, given 0.25 – 3 hrs after the oral apixaban dose. The highest reduction was found 
when activated charcoal was administered 3 hrs after the apixaban dose (1 hour before Tmax). 
(For more details of the pharmacokinetic studies, see the EPAR of the first MAA (2011)).

In the repeated dose studies, up to 6 months with a recovery phase in rats (doses up to 600 
mg/kg/day, AUC up to apixaban up to 30 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID) and to 1 year in 
dogs (doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, AUC up to > 80 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID), 
apixaban showed no significant toxicity. The major observed effects were those on blood coagulation 
parameters: PT and aPTT and, sometimes, fibrinogen and/or bleeding time. In some studies, minor 
effects on blood cells and/or on serum K, Na and/or Cl and/or evidence of subclinical haemorrhage was 
observed. Exposure to the major metabolite O-demethyl apixaban sulfate was not measured in the 
pivotal long term repeated dose studies. However, based on separate 7-day repeated dose 
pharmacokinetics studies in rats and dogs, systemic exposure to the metabolite was lower than in 
humans in the rat study and about similar to that in humans in the dog study. It was concluded that 
the metabolite was tested in the pivotal studies, but that these studies revealed no exposure margin 
for the metabolite. Since conjugates are usually not more toxic than the unconjugated compounds, and 
in addition to the toxicity studies with limited exposure there were data showing the absence of effects 
of the metabolite in pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology studies, no further toxicity data were 
deemed necessary. 
No evidence was found of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or adverse effects at clinical exposure levels on 
fertility, embryo-foetal development or pre/postnatal development. The original MAA only contained an 
exploratory juvenile toxicity study, the definitive study was ongoing at that time. With the first 
application for a line extension (2012) the report of the definitive juvenile toxicity study was provided. 
No special juvenile toxicity was observed in addition to the effects already known from the studies in 
adult animals.  
(For more details of the toxicological studies, see the EPAR of the first MAA (2011)). 
The ERA provided for the first MAA, was amended for the authorisation of the first line extension. It 
was further amended for the current line extension. For details, see the EPAR of the first MAA and that 
of the first line extension (2012).

Effect of activated charcoal treatment

The objective of the new Study 930046725 1.0 was to re-evaluate the effects of activated charcoal 
administration on pharmacokinetics of apixaban after oral administration to male beagle dogs using a 
cross-over design with the charcoal administration at different dose levels and time points. 
In this study, a five-treatment, 5-period, cross-over design was carried out. After fasted male dogs 
received apixaban (5 mg/kg, 1 mg/mL in 0.5% Tween 80 in Labrafil suspension) by oral gavage 
followed by a 10 mL flush of water, one control dog was treated with water while other dogs received 
activated charcoal as an aqueous suspension at either 250 mg/kg (low dose) at 3 or 5 hours, at 2500 
mg/kg (high dose) at 3 hours, or at 250 mg/kg (low dose) at 3 and 5 hours. The treatments were 
separated by at least 48 hours. Blood (1.0 mL, K3EDTA anticoagulant) at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 
14, 20, and 24 h was collected via venipuncture of a peripheral blood vessel and plasma was prepared 
by centrifugation. 
Activated charcoal treatments decreased apixaban AUC0-24h values by 15.5, 45.7, 6.9, and 21.5%, 
respectively, when administered at low dose 3 h, high dose 3 h, low dose 5 h , and low dose 3 and 5 h 
post apixaban dose. A dose of 2500 mg/kg activated charcoal significantly increased the clearance, and 
significantly reduced the AUC, MRT and C24, when administered three hours after apixaban (p < 0.05). 
The low dose (250 mg/kg) did not statistically significantly decrease exposure.  Activated charcoal did 
not have statistically significant effects on the half-life, the maximum plasma concentration, the time 
to reach peak concentration, mean residence time, or the volume of distribution. 
CHMP comments:  
For information: In the original MAA dossier, a study on the effect of activated charcoal treatment on 
apixaban pharmacokinetics in dogs was submitted. It was shown that in fasted Beagle dogs, 
bioavailability of apixaban could be decreased up to 50% by active charcoal treatment at a dose of 
250 mg/kg, 0.25 – 3 hrs after the oral apixaban dose. The highest reduction was found when 
activated charcoal was administered 3 hrs after the apixaban dose (1 hour before Tmax). 
The new study showed that at a sufficiently high dose, activated charcoal can reduce exposure to 
apixaban. In this study, however the effect of 250 mg/kg was very limited, whereas the higher dose 
Assessment report

of 2500 mg/kg had a clear, but still modest effect. The presumable mechanism is inhibition of 
absorption and reabsorption (after secretion into the intestine by biliary excretion and secretion by 
active transporters, see below). It is not clear how this effect should be extrapolated to the clinical 
situation. However, section 4.9 of the current SmPC contains treatment advice based on clinical data, 
therefore these dog data contribute no relevant new information regarding current advice in the 
SmPC.  
Effect of haemodialysis in dogs 
Study 930046779 1.0 examined effects of hemodialysis on circulating concentrations of apixaban 
(BMS-562247) following oral and intravenous dosing in male dogs.  
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of hemodialysis on circulating concentrations of 
apixaban (BMS-562247) after oral or intravenous administration to fasted male beagle dogs (8-12 kg 
body weight at start of study). Groups I, II, III, and IV dogs (n = 4) received sequential treatments 
with apixaban in order to measure the impact of dialysis on oral PK, intravenous PK, intravenous PK 
with hemodialysis, and oral PK with hemodialysis, respectively. The treatments were separated by at 
least 48 hours. The doses were 5 mg/kg, 1 mg/mL in 0.5% Tween 80 in Labrafil suspension by oral 
gavage followed by a 10 mL flush of water for PO, and 1 mg/kg, 1 mg/mL in 35% 2-hydroxypropyl-
beta-cyclodextrin in 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.0 by bolus injection followed by 0.5 mL flush of 0.9% 
NaCl for IV. For groups III and IV, dialysis started approximately 5 min after apixaban dose at 50 
mL/min blood flow and 300 mL/min dialysate flow in the opposite direction. Blood was collected from a 
port immediately before the dialysis filter at 0.166, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h and at 
0.166, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h from the port immediately after the dialysis filter. 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 16/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hemodialysis reduced apixaban concentrations including Cmax values during dialysis although overall 
AUC of apixaban was not greatly reduced. There was a concentration drop of apixaban after the 
dialysis filter for the majority of samples. The 4-hour dialysis removed approximately 20 and 6% of 
doses for IV and PO dosing, respectively. The hemodialysis clearance (17.3 mL/min/kg) was 
approximately three times the apixaban renal clearance in dogs.  
The MAH concluded that the results suggested that hemodialysis reduced apixaban concentrations. 
Therefore, hemodialysis could reduce bleeding risk from potential apixaban overdose and should be 
useful to remove apixaban for renal impaired patients. Dose adjustment might be needed for patients 
under dialysis due to removal of apixaban by hemodialysis. 
CHMP comments:  
The effect of hemodialysis in dogs was rather limited. Based on these data, it is not clear whether in 
case of a high overdose or if a patient needs enhanced elimination in other emergency situations (e.g. 
bleeding due to accident or e.g. unexpected operative procedures) exposure can be sufficiently 
reduced by dialysis. However, considering the new proposed text for section 4.9 (see below), there is 
already clinical data and therefore extrapolation of the dog data is not needed. Apparently, dialysis 
was not highly effective at therapeutic doses in humans either.  
According to new proposed text in section 4.9 of the SmPC: “Haemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC 
by 14% in subjects with end- stage renal disease (ESRD), when a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was 
administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to be an effective means of managing 
apixaban overdose.” 
Non clinical data suggest  that dose adjustment might be needed for patients under dialysis due to 
removal of apixaban by hemodialysis. According to section 4.2 of the SmPC, apixaban is not 
recommended in patients undergoing dialysis, because there is no clinical experience. 
The above proposal is considered acceptable.

Excretion and enterohepatic/enteroenteric recirculation 
The  excretion  and  enterohepatic  recirculation  of  apixaban  were  investigated  in  male  bile-duct 
cannulated (BDC) rats (wild type (WT) or P-gp or  BCRP  knock-out (KO)) and  in male dogs (BDC and 
intact)  following  a  single  IV  dose  of  2  mg/kg  or  1  mg/kg  14C-apixaban,  respectively  (studies  BMS-
r1759; NCPK3). The excretion pattern (expressed as radioactivity) and pharmacokinetic parameters in 
these animals are presented in the following two tables.

In  WT  BDC  rats,  drug-related  total  radioactivity  was  almost  completely  excreted  into  urine,  bile,  and 
faeces within 48 hours post-dose. It appears that urinary excretion is the major route of elimination for 
this compound in rats. Because the study was conducted in BDC rats, and the dose was administered 
IV, any radioactivity found in faeces is likely to be attributed to active secretion of the compound and 
its  metabolites  in  the  intestine.  When  the  P-gp/BCRP  inhibitor  elacridar  was  administered  along 
with 14C-apixaban, the excretion of apixaban was slightly increased in urine and bile, but decreased in 
faeces.  The  apixaban  AUC0-∞  increased  by  100%  compared  to  control  WT  rats.  When  active  charcoal 
was administered to WT BDC rats, it appears to have increased the radioactivity elimination, especially 
in  faeces.  Apixaban  exposure  (AUC)  decreased  slightly.  This  suggests  that  the  charcoal  is  able  to 
facilitate the excretion of radioactive material via the faecal route. 
In  P-gp  KO  BDC  rats,  drug-related  radioactivity  was  almost  completely  excreted  with  a  comparable 
excretion pattern as in WT BDC rats. The excretion pattern did not significantly alter in the presence of 
active charcoal. In BCRP KO BDC rats, drug-related radioactivity was also almost completely excreted 
within 48 hours, but the excretion pattern differed from that in WT BDC rats. The excretion via faeces 
in the BCRP KO BDC rat was elevated, which is opposite to what is expected. When activated charcoal

was  administered  along  with  14C-apixaban,  the  excretion  via  faeces  increased.  The  apixaban  AUC0-∞ 
increased by 45 and 66%, respectively, in P-gp KO and BCRP KO rats compared to WT rats. 
These  data  in  rats  clearly  demonstrate  that  inhibition  of  intestinal  efflux  transporters  decreases  the 
systemic  clearance  of  apixaban  leading  to  the  reduced  intestinal  excretion  and  active  charcoal 
increased  the  systemic  clearance  leading  to  the  increased  intestinal  excretion  because  of  disrupted 
apixaban re-absorption. 
Apixaban  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  in  BDC  rats  (n=3)  following  a  2  mg/kg  IV  dose  of 
[14C]apixaban with and without oral administration of activated charcoal and elacridar 
In  BDC  dogs  (excretion  pattern  and  pharmacokinetic  results,  see  two  following  tables),  ~46%  of  the 
dose was recovered in faeces, indicating the drug was directly excreted into the gut and eliminated via 
faeces. Upon treatment with active charcoal, the faecal recovery was increased to ~70% in BDC dogs. 
However,  as  total  recovery  was  also  greater  in  BDC  dogs  that  received  active  charcoal  compared  to 
BDC dogs not receiving active charcoal, this may interfere with the results. In addition, apixaban AUC 
was  reduced  by  ~19-39%  and  apparent  systemic  clearance  of  apixaban  was  increased  by  ~20-60%. 
The  increased  faecal  elimination  observed  in  BDC  dogs  treated  with  activated  charcoal  suggests  that 
active charcoal prevents re-absorption of apixaban thereby resulting in increases of intestinal excretion 
through interruption of entero-hepatic recirculation.

The  contributions  of  P-gp  and  BCRP  in  governing  apixaban  disposition  were  also  examined  after  oral 
doses in rats. Apixaban exposure (AUC) increased by 100% in the P-gp KO rats, and by 300% in the 
BCRP  KO  rats  compared  with  WT  rats,  predominately  through  an  increase  in  Cmax.  The  concomitant 
administration  of  the  P-gp/BCRP  inhibitor  elacridar  increased  apixaban  exposures  (AUC)  by  nearly 
400% in WT rats. See table 3 below for the pharmacokinetic parameters.

Metabolite profile in excreta 
The metabolite profile in excreta in WT, P-gp KO and BCRP KO rats after IV dosing is presented in the 
table  shown  below  (study  BMS-R1759).  Unchanged  apixaban  was  the  most  prominent  drug-related 
component  in  urine  and  accounted  for  more  than  91%  of  total  urine  radioactivity  in  all  3  groups  of 
animals. In addition, a number of metabolites were observed in trace quantities. In contrast to urine, 
unchanged apixaban was found along with other significant drug-related components (metabolites) in 
bile of rats from all 3 groups. Several metabolites were observed to be present in high levels. However, 
it  must  be  noted  that  the  elimination  of  total  radioactivity  via  biliary  route  for  this  compound  was 
<15% of total dose for all 3 groups. Similar to urine, unchanged apixaban was the most predominant 
drug-related  component  present  in  faeces,  while  M475a,  M475b  and  M445  were  observed  as  minor 
metabolites in all groups of animals. The metabolites were not identified, however M475a and b were 
proposed  to  be  formed  by  hydroxylation,  M445  by  desmethylation,  M473  by  hydroxylation-
dehydrogenation, and M487 was believed to be dihydroxylated M445 or dioxo analogue of apixaban.

Besides  renal  excretion,  apixaban  is  directly  excreted  into  the  intestine  and  eliminated  via  faeces  in

both rat and dog. Also in humans, apixaban has multiple routes of elimination including metabolism, 
renal excretion, biliary excretion and direct secretion into the intestine. Transporters involved are P-gp 
and BCRP with BCRP playing a larger role than P-gp as indicated by decreased faecal elimination and 
higher  systemic  exposures  when  these  transporters  are  inhibited.  In  conclusion,  these  data  suggest 
that if apixaban is concomitantly administered with especially BCRP inhibitors, direct secretion into the 
intestine will be inhibited. Thus, this could lead to possible drug-drug interactions by diminishing one 
of  the  elimination  routes.  Active  charcoal  may  increase  faecal  excretion  and  decrease  systemic 
exposure to apixaban by interference in both initial absorption and in the entero-enteric recirculation 
although the effects are not very large. 
P-gp inhibition 
The  potential  of  apixaban  (BMS-562247)  to  inhibit  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)-mediated  digoxin  efflux  was 
evaluated in a Caco-2 inhibition assay (study 930050578). No inhibition of digoxin efflux was observed 
up to a maximum concentration of 62 μM apixaban. 
At clinically relevant concentrations, apixaban is not an inhibitor of P-gp.

Preclinical and clinical assessments of a major human circulating metabolite of apixaban, 
apixaban O-demethyl sulfate (M1) 
In Report 930043709 1.0 the major human circulating metabolite M1 is discussed. Following oral 
administration of a single 20 mg dose of [14C]apixaban, the major circulating component in plasma was 
the parent compound in humans . A major circulating metabolite, O-demethyl apixaban sulfate (M1), 
represented approximately 25% of the estimated parent AUC (approximately 20% of total drug-related 
materials). The document summarises the available pharmacokinetic and toxicological information 
provided for this metabolite as provided in the initial MAA. Safety of the exposure to this metabolite at 
an apixaban dose of 2.5 mg/kg twice daily is discussed.  
CHMP comment:  
-  Report 930043709 is dated 29 April 2010, i.e. it was written after the submission of the first 
MAA assessment, but before the authorisation of Eliquis in 2011. It does not add relevant new 
information to the assessment of the first MAA. In particular it does not discuss to which 
extent the exposure to M1 at the higher dose of 10 mg twice daily is covered by the already 
provided documentation.  
-  Since no new toxicological data has been provided with regard to M1 and because even at a 
dose of 2.5 mg twice daily exposure of the relevant non-clinical species was only marginally 
covered by the existing data package, it must be concluded that the available non-clinical 
studies don’t cover the exposure to M1 at the increased dose recommended for the line 
extension.  
- 
In the original MAA the following conclusions were drawn in the Day 150 JAR (Question 3):  
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 22/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Exposure in the 52 week dog study may have been about 1 – 2 times human exposure (i.e. 
twice daily 2.5 mg, the recommended dose in the initial MAA). In the 2 year rat 
carcinogenicity study exposure was 0.36 µg.h/mL in males and 0.22 µg.h/mL in females vs 
0.37 µg.h/mL in humans, so exposure in rats was ≤ humans (at a dose of twice daily 2.5 
mg).” and:  
“Overall it is concluded that Ο-desmethyl apixaban sulfate is not pharmacologically active and 
showed no significant activity in in vitro cardiovascular safety studies, but exposure at the 
highest dose levels in the repeated dose studies is not high enough to justify any margin of 
exposure for the toxicity studies. Since conjugates are usually not more toxic than the 
unconjugated compounds, and in addition to the toxicity studies with limited exposure there 
are some results from pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology studies, no further toxicity 
data are requested.” 
-  Since the recommended dose of 20 mg/day for the new indication of the current line 
extension is 4 times higher than the dose assessed in the initial MAA AR, exposure in the non-
clinical studies does not cover the clinical exposure in patients (1.5 µg.h/mL at 10 mg twice 
daily vs 0.37 µg.h/mL at the lower dose of twice daily 2.5 mg). It is concluded that the non-
clinical dossier provides very limited information regarding safety of exposure to this 
metabolite, due to much lower exposure in the toxicity studies as compared to patients. 
Nevertheless, considering the existing clinical experience with doses up to 20 mg/day, it is not 
deemed necessary to ask for new studies testing the toxicity of M1.    
2.2.3.  Toxicology  
No new toxicity data were provided.  
The nonclinical overview for the current line extension provides the following information regarding 
human exposure at the increased recommended dose: 
At the recommended human dose (RHD) of 20 mg for the 1-week lead-in period, human exposure 
values for apixaban are 0.36 µg/mL for the highest observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and 5.5 
µg.h/mL for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). At the RHD of 10 mg for 
chronic treatment, human exposure values for apixaban are 0.21 µg/mL for Cmax and 3.1 µg.h/mL for 
AUC. For the major human circulating metabolite of apixaban (O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate), which 
has no meaningful FXa inhibitory activity, the Cmax values are 0.0449 µg/mL and 0.0718 µg/mL and 
the AUC values are 0.94 µg.h/mL and 1.5 µg.h/mL at the RHD of 10 and 20 mg, respectively, for VTE 
Tx. The source for these apixaban and O-desmethyl apixaban sulphate exposure values is clinical 
pharmacology study CV185046. Based on the short circulating half-life of apixaban in humans, plasma 
apixaban levels are expected to reach a new, lower steady state within a few days of switching from 
the lead-in dose of 20 mg to the long-term dose of 10 mg. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, 
apixaban or O-desmethyl apixaban sulphate exposure multiples (Cmax or AUC, as appropriate) are 
relative to the human values (ie, animal exposure value ÷ human exposure value) at the RHD of 10 
mg for chronic VTE Tx. Margins relative to the lead-in RHD of 20 mg are only shown for potentially 
acute effects, such as hemorrhage. 
The following exposure table was derived from a similar table in the Day 80 AR, however with the new 
human exposure included:

At the higher dose of twice daily 10 mg, exposure margins based on the pivotal repeated dose toxicity 
studies are still of reasonable magnitude. However, it is noted that if the species difference in plasma 
protein binding at high plasma concentrations (1-10 µM = 0.46 – 4.6 µg/ml) is taken into account, 
these factors decrease with a factor 2-4, and sensitivity of the non-clinical species for the 
pharmacodynamics effect of apixaban may be lower: the in vitro affinity of apixaban for rat and dog 
factor Xa (Ki : rat 1.4 nM, dog 1.8 nM) is about a factor 20 lower compared to human factor Xa (Ki : 
0.08nM). However, the protein binding in humans is lower at lower concentrations: Cmax at the 10 
mg twice daily dose Cmax is 0.36 µg/ml. In human serum, in vitro protein binding was 87% at 0.46 
µg/mL, while protein binding in serum taken from humans following apixaban administration 
(apixaban concentrations of 0.034 to 0.11 µg/mL) was ~93%.  
In the initial AR the main toxicity was described as following :

“In the repeated dose studies, up to 6 months with a recovery phase in rats (doses up to 600 
mg/kg/day, AUC up to apixaban up to 30 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID) and to 1 year in 
dogs (doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, AUC up to > 80 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID), 
apixaban showed no significant toxicity. The major observed effects were those on blood coagulation 
parameters: PT and aPTT and, sometimes, fibrinogen and/or bleeding time. In some studies, minor 
effects on blood cells and/or on serum K, Na and/or Cl and/or evidence of subclinical haemorrhage 
were observed.”  
Therefore, the toxicity can be fully explained by the pharmacodynamic action of apixaban. Considering 
the above information, it is concluded that at reasonable exposure no other safety risks were 
identified than those which are related to the intended pharmacological effect. Considering the 
possible species differences in sensitivity for the pharmacological effect, safety aspects related to this 
effect should preferably be assessed based on the clinical data. Further data regarding toxicity of 
apixaban are not deemed necessary. 
2.2.4 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A full ERA has already been presented and evaluated for Eliquis 2.5 mg tablets in the initial MAA 
procedure. At that time a complete dossier was submitted, meeting the requirements of the EMA 
guideline on ERA. The ERA concluded that no risk to the environment was anticipated following the use 
of Eliquis 2.5 mg tablets. The active ingredient apixaban is not PBT, nor vPvB. In a subsequent line 
extension procedure, the same, complete ERA dossier was submitted. Due to the added indication and 
increased dose, the environmental exposure was expected to increase. Now, the same ERA dossier was 
resubmitted for the current line extension application, again resulting in an additional indication and 
increase of dose. The applicant has submitted a revised ERA, which will be evaluated with respect to 
the PEC calculations and the result of the revised risk quotients. 
All endpoints resulting from the ERA can be found in the table with environmental endpoints, which is 
to be published in the EPAR upon finalisation of the authorisation process.

Refinement of F pen  
The resulting PECsurface water  using the default Fpen is 0.10 µg L-1. Applicant has performed a Phase IIA 
assessment, resulting in conservative prevalence figures (equal to or rounded up from highest 
estimate in six different EU countries) of 1.0% (rounded up from 0.44%) for prevention of VTE in 
patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery (indication 1, initial MAA), of 1.0% (highest 
estimated value) for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (indication 2, first line extension) and of 1.0% (rounded up from 0.37%) for 
treatment/prevention of VTE (indication 3, second = current line extension) and assuming 
administration to the entire population covered by the prevalence values.  
The applicant presented data on metabolism in humans to establish a fraction of excreted, unchanged 
active of 0.57. The applicant does not further address the environmental risk of the remaining fraction 
(metabolites). Since metabolite testing is not a requirement, the remainder of the ERA will be 
performed without using data on metabolism, following a total residue approach.  
The PECsw values for the three indications, without correction for metabolism, are:

Conclusion

no risk 
PECsurface water exceeds the action limit, thus warranting a Phase IIA assessment, which was performed 
by the applicant. Based on the outcome of the Phase II A assessment it is concluded that no risks for 
the STP, surface water and groundwater are anticipated following the use of apixaban. 
•  Phase II Tier B 
The simulation study in water/sediment systems (OECD 308) triggered a risk assessment for the 
sediment compartment. 
PEC calculation for sediment and soil 
PECsediment is calculated using equilibrium partitioning and REACH (EUSES) equations using 
characteristics for suspended matter (sediment). EUSES standard suspended matter contains 10% 
organic carbon. A Koc of 12.2 L kg-1 is used.  
Using PECsurface water = 0.175 µg L-1, PECsediment = 0.844 µg kg dw
-1 (10% o.c.). 
In the toxicity study with C. riparius, the NOEC could not be determined as no effects were observed at 
-1. This 
all concentrations tested. The result of the study is therefore presented as NOEC ≥ 100 mg kg dw
slightly deviates from the first assessment (MAA) where the result was presented as 
NOEC = 100 mg kg dw
-1. 
Moreover, the test result was obtained in sediment with 2.4% organic carbon. Hence, the result is 
NOEC ≥ 417 mg kg dw
performed since the PECsediment calculated above is also valid for sediment with 10% organic carbon.  
-1 for sediment with 10% organic carbon. Normalisation to 10% organic carbon is 
Applying an assessment factor of 100, the PNECsediment is ≥ 4.17 mg kg dw
sediment is thus 0.844/≥4170 =.≤ 2.0x10-4.

CHMP comments  
The applicant performed the PECsediment calculation correctly, but departed from a different 
PECsurface water and presented the wet weight PECsediment. Furthermore, the PNECsediment of the applicant 
was not normalised to sediment with 10% organic carbon. Applying these corrections results in a risk 
quotient well below 1. In conclusion, no risk for the sediment compartment is anticipated.

The dossier is considered complete with respect to environmental fate and toxicity studies. No further 
test data are required. 
•  Conclusion 
Apixaban (BMS-562247), CAS nr. 503612-47-3, is a selective, reversible inhibitor of the coagulation 
factor Xa (FXa).  Its log K ow is 1.2 (shake flask), water solubility 38-60 mg/L at 25°C and its K oc 12.2 
L/kg (HPLC method; log K oc = 1.09). Apixaban is not readily biodegradable. In a water/sediment 
simulation study (OECD 308), half life values of 31.5-41.7 d were found for the water phase and 100-
182 d for the whole system, all determined at 20±2°C.  
Summary of toxicity data  
Inhibition of activated sludge respiration: EC50 > 1000 mg/L and hence NOEC > 1000 mg/L. Aquatic 
species: green alga P. subcapitata, 3 d NOEC 3.6 mg/L (growth rate); crustacean D. magna, 21 d 
NOEC 9.6 mg/L (reproduction); fish P. Promelas, 32 d NOEC ≥ 10 mg/L (E.L.S. test, hatching success, 
percentage of embryos producing live normal larvae at hatch, survival at test termination, and larval 
growth (total length and dry weight)). Sediment dwelling organism, midge C. riparius, 28 d 
NOEC 417 mg/kg dw (emergence and development rate; result normalised to 10% o.c.).  
Using a conservative refined Fpen of 0.01, combining for each indication, the different recommended 
doses for the three indications and without correction for treatment regime and metabolism,the sum of 
the PECsurface water values of the three indications was 0.175 µg/L.  
No risk following the use of apixaban was anticipated for the sewage treatment plant, surface water, 
groundwater and sediment. 
PBT assessment  
Apixaban does not meet the screening criterion for B, since log Kow is < 4.5. Based on the OECD 308 
study and the resulting whole system halflife values of 100-182 at 20°C, the P criterion is met. Based 
on the aquatic toxicity data submitted, the substance is not T. In conclusion, apixaban is not PBT, nor 
vPvB. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of apixaban.  Apixaban is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.   
In conclusion, an update of the section 6.6 of the SmPC is introduced : “Any unused medicinal product 
or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.”

2.2.5 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The company provided updated non-clinical overview, and updated written and tabulated 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology summaries.  
A correction of a pharmacodynamics study was provided. This had no implications for previously drawn 
conclusions.  
There are no new toxicological data and no further data are deemed necessary, although it is noted 
that exposure margins of the major metabolite (M1) are very low. 
New pharmacokinetic studies were provided. These studies provided evidence of entero-hepatic and 
entero-enteric recirculation in dogs and rats, likely due to biliary excretion and active intestinal 
excretion/uptake processes mediated by P-gp and BCRP transporters.  
Studies with active charcoal in rats and dogs showed that this treatment reduces systemic exposure to 
a limited degree, presumably by preventing intestinal reabsorption. Although it is not certain how the 
observed limited effects on systemic exposure should be extrapolated to patients, the advice that the 
administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose 
or accidental ingestion (based on clinical studies in healthy subjects) was previously included 
in section 4.9 of the SmPC”. 
Therefore, no further information regarding extrapolation to clinical practice is deemed necessary.  
A study regarding the effect of hemodialysis on systemic exposure in dogs was also provided. The 
results showed a limited decrease of systemic exposure. Based on the results, it is concluded that dose 
adjustment might be needed for patients under dialysis due to removal of apixaban by hemodialysis. 
However, according to section 4.2 of the SmPC, apixaban is not recommended in patients undergoing 
dialysis, because there is no clinical experience.

2.2.6 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Additional data in dogs were provided on reduction of systemic exposure by haemodialysis, showing 
only a very limited effect of haemodialysis. Additional data in dogs and rats show that active charcoal 
treatment may lower systemic exposure to a limited degree.  
Furthermore data were provided regarding the role of Pgp and BCRP transporters in intestinal secretion 
c.q. reabsorption. From the initially provided dossier (MAA) it was already known that these 
transporters play a role in these processes and that enterohepatic and enteroenteric recirculation 
occur. In addition, a study was provided on inhibition by apixaban of Pgp. No inhibition was found up 
to a high concentration. This confirms the conclusion already drawn on the basis of the  initial MAA that 
apixaban is not an inhibitor of Pgp. 
No additional non-clinical data are requested.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The clinical pharmacology profile of apixaban has been characterized based on the results of 35 clinical 
pharmacology studies as well as population pharmacokinetic (PPK) and exploratory exposure response 
(E-R) analyses in the VTE treatment patient population that incorporated data from Phase 1, 2, and 3 
studies. Details can be found in Module 2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies. 
The apixaban clinical pharmacology program was designed to evaluate the PK, PD, and initial safety 
and tolerability profile over a broad dose range and included subjects with characteristics 
representative of the intended apixaban patient populations.

The food effect study was an open label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, crossover study 
evaluating food effect on single dose of the 5 mg apixaban commercial tablet in 22 healthy adult male 
and female subjects. The effect of a standard high-fat, high-calorie meal was evaluated. 
The PK parameters AUCinf, AUClast, Cmax, Tmax and t half were summarized descriptively by treatment, 
and the log transformed AUCinf, AUClast, Cmax of apixaban with and without food were statistically 
compared. 
The PK results of the study are summarized in table PK01.

Based on this study the MAH concludes that the observed decrease in apixaban exposure in the fed 
condition (approximately a 20% decrease in AUC and 15% decrease in Cmax) compared to the fasted 
condition is not considered clinically significant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended.

apixaban and the active prasugrel metabolite R-138727were summarized descriptively and the 
different treatments were statistically compared with regard to the Cmax and AUC The main PK results 
of this study are presented in table PK02 and PK03 and the main pharmacodynamic results in figure 
PK01 and PK02 
Apixaban exposure was equivalent when administered alone and when coadministered with prasugrel; 
the 90% CIs for apixaban Cmax and AUCTAU geometric least squares (LS) mean ratios were wholly 
contained within the predefined no effect interval of 0.8 - 1.25.

The total exposure to the active prasugrel metabolite R-138727 was not affected but a small decrease 
of the maximum concentration was observed. According to the applicant the difference in R-138727 
Cmax values between the treatments is not likely to be of clinical significance based on the lack of PD 
interactions.

The MAH concluded that apixaban had a negligible effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. There 
was an apparent decrease in ADP-induced platelet aggregation at the 9-hour time point following 
apixaban administration (Treatment A) on Day 4 only; however, platelet aggregation returned to 
baseline by the 24-hour time point. The reason for this decrease at 9 h is unknown. 
Prasugrel alone resulted in a decrease in ADP-induced platelet aggregation on Day 1 that was 
maintained through Day 4, consistent with prasugrel’s mechanism of action; the presence of apixaban 
did not influence this effect.

According to the MAH the mean anti-FXa activity versus time profile on Day 4, when apixaban was 
administered alone, was similar to that of apixaban administered with prasugrel, as shown in the figure 
below. In addition, when apixaban was administered alone, the resulting apixaban plasma 
concentrations had a linear relationship with the corresponding anti-FXa values. This relationship did 
not seem to change when apixaban was coadministered with prasugrel. All subjects receiving prasugrel 
alone (Treatment B) had anti-FXa activity values under the detectable limit (<0.1 IU/mL).

Objectives 
The objectives of these pharmacometric analyses are: 
1.  To describe the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment 
subjects using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) approach. 
2.  To estimate the impact of physiological and demographic factors that may affect apixaban 
pharmacokinetics in VTE treatment subjects. This investigation primarily focused on estimating 
covariate effects including sex, age, renal function, race, body weight, time of administration 
(diurnal variation), concomitant medication, and patient status, if any, on interindividual 
differences in the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. 
3.  To characterize the relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-Xa activity 
(AXA) in VTE treatment subjects.

4.  To explore the relationship between apixaban exposure and safety and efficacy endpoints in 
VTE treatment subjects. The safety endpoint was an adjudicated composite of major bleeding 
(MB) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and the efficacy endpoint was an 
adjudicated composite of symptomatic VTE (non-fatal DVT or non-fatal PE) or VTE-related 
death. 
Study Design and methodology 
Data from 11 clinical studies (8 Phase 1, one Phase 2, and two Phase 3 studies) were included in the 
analyses. The study design, study population, and timing of blood samples varied among the 11 clinical 
studies. The PPK final analysis included 8323 PK observations from 970 subjects. The PK-AXA analysis 
was based on data from five Phase 1 studies as well as the Phase 2 and two Phase 3 VTE treatment 
clinical trials. The final AXA analysis included 3139 AXA observations from 795 subjects. The MAH 
provided an adequate description of the demographics of the studied population. The exploratory 
safety and efficacy analyses were based on the composite bleeding endpoint (MB or CRNMB) and 
efficacy event data (VTE or VTE-related death) from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 VTE treatment clinical 
trials.  
The popution model used was based on PPK models developed previously in VTEp and AF populations, 
a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was applied to fit the observed data in terms of the 
following parameters: apparent oral clearance (CL/F; L/hr), apparent inter-compartmental clearance 
(Q/F; L/hr), apparent volume of distribution (central = Vc/F and peripheral = Vp/F; L), and first-order 
absorption rate constant (ka; hr-1). The covariates that were evaluated were: Dosing time (diurnal 
variation), Age, Sex , Body weight , Asian race , Patient status and Concomitant medication (strong or 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4/P-gp).  
Results  
Apixaban pharmacokinetics were adequately described with a 2-compartment model with first-order 
absorption and first-order elimination. Covariate effects on CL/F are illustrated in Figure PK03 as a 
ratio of the typical model predicted CL/F relative to that for the reference VTE treatment subject. The 
90% confidence interval of a ratio was generated by 1000 non-parametric bootstrapping sets of 
population parameter values using the final PPK model.  
The covariates that were determined to be predictive of apixaban apparent CL/F included renal 
function, age, sex, Asian race, and concomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/p-gp 
inhibitors as a combined concomitant medication category.

Figure PK03 Illustration of Covariate Effects on CL/F 
Solid squares represent the ratio of the typical predicted CL/F relative to the reference subject. The 
black line represents the 90% confidence interval of the ratio. The reference subject in the VTE 
treatment population is defined as a male patient who is non-Asian, 60 years of age, and has a body 
weight of 85 kg and cCrCL = 100 mL/min, and did not receive a concomitant strong or moderate 
CYP3A4/p-gp inhibitor. 
The MAH concludes that the predicted change in apixaban exposure was generally of a similar 
magnitude as that observed in the dedicated Phase 1 studies. Given the limited impact on apixaban 
exposure, no dose adjustment for apixaban is required based on these factors alone, however, caution 
is warranted when multiple factors that could affect apixaban exposure are present. The impact of 
strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp could not be adequately evaluated in this PPK analysis, 
given limited concomitant use in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. The results of the covariate analysis 
therefore largely reflect the effect of moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors. 
The MAH has evaluated the relationship between apixaban exposure and Anti-Xa activity a linear model 
and a quadratic model. Although previous evaluations showed consistently that a linear model 
adequately describes the relationship between apixaban concentration and AXA in the therapeutic dose 
range after administration of 2.5 and 5mg BID. However for the VTE treatment indication there seems 
to be a trend for a more than dose proportional increase at higher apixaban concentrations as is 
illustrated by the better fit of the quadratic model (figure PK04). For the VTE treatment indication in 
the first days a higher dose is administered (10mg BID) and this results in higher concentrations of 
Apixaban.

The event rate relationships for the composite bleeding endpoint (MB or CRNMB), as well as for the 
efficacy endpoint (VTE or VTE-related death), were explored, but could not be characterized due to the 
small number of events. 
Previous Population PK studies 
In the original marketing authorisation application another population PK study was conducted. There 
is no overlap between the patients that were included the population PK study PMAR-00312 and this 
study . This new population study included the PK data of 4 phase II and III trials (Study 
CV185010,CV185047, 185035 and 185027), all patients included were treated for the prevention of 
VTE. 
Based on the initial population PK analyses it is concluded that the results of the clinical 
pharmacokinetic trials can be translated to the target population as the population PK data were 
consistent with findings from the clinical pharmacology studies. Of the covariates included in the final

model (age, gender, body weight, surgery, hematocrit, and renal function) only severe renal 
impairment and the combination of female gender, age > 75 years, creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 
mL/min, and weight < 50 kg were predicted to increase apixaban exposure by approximately 58% and 
64%, respectively. The predicted effect of most other covariates on apixaban exposure was < 25%.  
2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic data are submitted in relation to the requested indication. 
2.3.4. Discussion and Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Food Effect 
In the original marketing authorization application of apixaban, one food effect study was conducted 
(study CV185008). In this study, the food effect of a single dose of 10 mg apixaban (2x5 mg Phase 2 
tablets) was investigated in 22 healthy subjects comparing the PK of apixaban administered in fasted 
state or following a high-fat meal. When apixaban was administered shortly after a high-fat meal, 
apixaban geometric mean ratio (fed/fasted) for Cmax, AUCinf and AUC0-T were 110%, 104% and 
105%. Based on this study it was concluded that a high-fat, high-caloric meal does not affect the PK of 
apixaban. As a result of this outcome, subsequent Phase 2 and 3 studies allowed administration of 
apixaban without regards to meal intake. 
In the new food effect study B0661019, a slightly greater food effect was found (15-20% decrease in 
exposure), but this slightly greater effect is again not considered clinically relevant by the CHMP. 
Therefore, it is agreed that no adaptation of the SmPC section 5.2 nor 4.2 is needed based on this 
study. 
Interaction with prasugrel  
No clinically relevant interaction between prasugrel and apixaban was found in Study CV185073. 
Therefore, the proposed SmPC section 4.5 changes with regard to concomitant use of prasugrel can be 
accepted. 
Population PK study 
The results of the population PK study are in line with with the results of the clinical pharmacology 
trials.  The company compared the results of the three population studies in the different patient 
populations and it can be concluded that the population PK data are consistent between the studies.  
Upon request form CHMP, the company provided a more detailed description of the demographics of 
the population that was included in the population PK study. The findings of the population PK study 
are in line with the previously reported data from the clinical pharmacology trials according to which 
the exposure to apixaban is increased in patients with renal dysfunction. Based on the available data it 
can be concluded that the exposure to apixaban is expected to be 40- 60% higher in patients with 
severe renal dysfunction, although the number of subjects with severe renal impairment was low. The 
updated information with regards to renal impairment is discussed later in this report.   
The covariate evaluation in the current VTE treatment PPK analyses is consistent with the Phase 1 
observations. A decrease of the apixaban clearance was mainly observed in subjects with a decreased 
renal function, although the number of subjects was low. This observation is line with the results of the 
phase I study CV185018 that was submitted as a part of the original application dossier. Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 39/104 
 
 
 
 
 
CV185018 evaluated the apixaban PK in patients with renal impairment. Subjects with mild(N=10), 
moderate(N=7), and severe (N=7) renal disfunction had 16%, 29% and 38% higher AUCs (INF), 
respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Based on all available data it can be 
concluded that the exposure to apixaban is expected to be 40- 60% higher in patients with severe 
renal dysfunction. The impact of the disease status was sufficiently studied in the PK analysis 
performed for each indication. Due the fact that the VTEtx patients were relatively young and healthy 
the PK of apixaban for these patients was comparable to the results of the healthy volunteers , no 
difference was observed with regards to CLT/F compared to healthy subjects. 
The company evaluated apixaban exposure and Anti-Xa activity (Figure PK04) and based on the 
presented data can be concluded that quadratic model seems to predict the relationship between 
exposure and the Anti-Xa activity better, especially for higher concentrations apixaban. The MAH was 
therefore asked to further adapt the table in which the predicted Apixaban Steady State Exposure and 
AXA in VTE Treatment Population is presented in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Because the apixaban PK is similar between the previously investigated populations and patients that 
are treated for DVT and PE it is agreed that there is no need to adapt section 5.2 of the SmPC 
(Pharmacokinetic properties). 
Interaction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and Pgp 
The company has not submitted any new data with regard to the concomitant use of inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A4 and Pgp. For all indications the concomitant use of systemic treatment with strong 
inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp is not recommended.The potential for decreased efficacy in the 
presence of concomitant strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp is likely to have greater clinical 
significance in the treatment of VTE population than for the VTEp and NVAF indications. 
Therefore it is acceptable that the SmPC text with regards to this interaction is different between 
indications. In conclusion a warning is introduced in section 4.4 and corresponding information in 
section 4.5 to mention that in case of concomittant treatment with CYP 3A4 and Pgp strong inducers, 
apixaban should not be used since efficacy may be compromised  for the treatment of DVT or PE (see 
section 2.4 Clinical efficacy). 
Interaction with grapefruit juice 
No dose recommendations or additional recommendations are required for the concomitant 
consumption of grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice (when consumed in usual dietary volumes) should be 
considered as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and for other moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 no clinically 
relevant interaction with apixaban has been found. Therefore no interaction with grapefruit juice is 
expected to occur. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose ranging study 
At the time of initiation of dose-response study CV185017, there were no completed Phase 2 studies 
with apixaban. The available preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic data for apixaban supported the 
selected dose range of apixaban (5 mg BID, 10 mg BID and 20 mg QD) for treating subjects 
presenting with acute symptomatic DVT, as described in the study protocol.

Study Design 
Study CV185017 was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy 
and safety of 5 mg BID apixaban (130 subjects randomized), 10 mg BID apixaban (134 subjects 
randomized), and 20 mg QD apixaban (128 subjects randomized) versus LMWH or fondaparinux plus 
VKA (128 subjects randomized) in treating subjects with acute symptomatic DVT. The apixaban 
treatments were double-blind; the LMWH or fondaparinux plus VKA was open-label. There was a 12 
week treatment period and a 30 day follow-up period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of adjudicated symptomatic recurrent VTE or 
deterioration of the thrombotic burden as assessed by repeat compression ultrasound (CUS) and 
perfusion lung scan (PLS). CUS of the legs and PLS were to be performed within 36 hours of 
randomization and at 12 weeks. The ICAC reviewed and adjudicated all suspected thromboembolic 
events, deaths, baseline and repeat CUS and PLS, and all episodes of suspected bleeding. 
The primary safety endpoint was the composite of adjudicated MB/CRNMB. Safety was assessed via 
the review of all reported adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory test 
results. 
Study Results 
There were no differences in baseline disease characteristics between the apixaban treatment groups 
and the LMWH/VKA comparator group that were considered to have an impact on the overall outcome 
of the study. The incidence of previous VTE was similar between the apixaban and comparator groups 
(approximately 25%). 
Primary Endpoint Events were infrequent across all treatment groups (4.7% for all apixaban groups 
combined; 4.2% comparator). The differences in event rates between the apixaban and the 
LMWH/VKA treatment groups were not statistically significant (95% CIs for the difference included 
zero). The lowest incidence (2.6%) of recurrent VTE/deterioration across all treatment groups was in 
the apixaban 20 mg QD group (Table E1).

Bleeding rates based on all adjudicated bleeds during the treatment period were lower in each of the 
apixaban treatment groups than in the comparator group. Incidences of bleeding-related AEs were also 
lower in all apixaban groups compared to the LMWH/VKA group (Table E2).

Recommended Apixaban Doses for the Treatment and Prevention of Recurrent VTE 
The recommended dose of Eliquis for the treatment of acute DVT and PE is 10 mg twice daily for the 
first 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily. 
The recommended dose of Eliquis for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, following completion of 
at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE, is 2.5 mg twice daily. 
Discussion on the dose selection 
The exact doses for the phase 3 studies were not tested in this trial. In study CV185017, the efficacy 
of the 20 mg once daily dose regimen was numerically superior to the regimens 5 mg BID and 10 mg 
BID. Bleeding rates (assessed as combination of MB and CRNMB or as trivial bleedings) were better in 
all apixaban groups when compared to LMWH/VKA, but 20 mg QD appeared to be associated with most 
bleedings among the apixaban groups. A once-daily dosing regimen would be preferable from a 
convenience standpoint. However, it appears that bleedings are less frequent with the dose divided in 
two halves over the day. This is also the approved dose regimen in other indications. 
Based on comparison to approved treatment regimens with other products (e.g. LMWH) and the 
approved regimen for apixaban in atrial fibrillation indication, the Applicant chose a BID regimen with a 
higher dose during the first week of treatment for further development when risk for thromboembolism 
is at its highest. This reasoning is supported and considered acceptable by the CHMP. This dose of 10 
mg BID is the highest investigated in the apixaban clinical program and has not been approved for any 
other indication yet. 
The proposed dose for treatment of VTE including prevention of recurrence is 5 mg BID for 6 months 
after the index event; if after that period continued prophylaxis is required, a lower dose of 2.5 mg BID 
was shown equally effective as discussed below. Thus, it might be questioned if the dose could have 
been reduced earlier than 6 months from 5 mg BID to 2.5 mg BID. However, based on the small 
difference in safety profile between both dosages and the large effort it would require to investigate 
this in a clinical trial, the currently proposed posology is considered acceptable by the CHMP. The 
SmPC section 4.2 has been amended accordingly.  
For extended VTE prophylaxis, the dose is again primarily based on extrapolation of data from other 
products and other indications. It was decided to test both doses to phase 3 development program, 
which both proved effective with (small) differences, mainly in safety, as shown later. 
Considering that dose adaptations are required in certain patient groups in the SPAF indication, e.g. 
patients with exclusive criteria of severe renal impairment, or patients with ≥2 risk factors, e.g. age ≥ 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 42/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl (133 micromole/l), applying no dose 
adjustments for these same groups in the current program required additional discussion with the 
CHMP. This was particularly important  for the first 7 days of treatment when a dose of 10 mg BID is 
administered. To address this issue, the applicant explained the differences between management of 
SPAF and VTEt necessitating different dose recommendations. A dose of 10 mg BID is used in the 
first week of VTEt to ensure maximal efficacy for dissolving the clot and prevention of extension. In 
this population, available exposure data in patients with severe renal impairment (n=29) in relation 
to efficacy and safety are not helpful due to the small number of bleeding events (MB = 1) but shows 
a higher risk of major bleeding of 1.18 (95% CI 0.13, 10.98) for apixaban vs. enoxaparin/warfarin.  
To improve interpretation of the results, the MAH submitted pooled data of moderate and severe 
renal impairment patients. For the whole treatment period, efficacy and safety results are in line with 
those of patients with mild renal impairment, in which no dose adaptations are recommended.  
Specific results for the first 9 days to address safety of the highest dose include very limited events 
precluding any robust conclusions. However, a higher bleeding tendency can not be excluded. Still, it 
was  agreed with the applicant that the B/R of  non-investigated dose reductions is not known and 
accordingly cannot be advised. Comparable results were presented for patients with a combination of 
risk factors (age, weight or renal impairment) who constituted around 100 patients in AMPLIFY. The 
presented data do not indicate any increased risk compared to the general cohort. In conclusion, 
available data are reassuring but can not robustly exclude a bleeding risk due to the limited patients 
numbers. Theoretical dose adaptations can not be advised either. The agreed SmPC wording clearly 
reflects the limitation of the clinical trial data and the associated risks above described. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
2.4.2.1.   Background information 
Efficacy and safety for the proposed indication have been demonstrated in 2 completed pivotal Phase 3 
studies (CV185056, AMPLIFY and CV185057, AMPLIFY EXT) and the aforementioned completed 
supportive Phase 2 study (CV185017). 
CV185056 (AMPLIFY) was a randomized, active controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, triple-dummy 
study in subjects with acute symptomatic proximal DVT or acute symptomatic PE. Randomization was 
stratified by the type of disease (symptomatic proximal DVT only or symptomatic PE with or without 
DVT) at baseline. If a subject had both symptomatic proximal DVT and symptomatic PE, the subject 
was stratified to the symptomatic PE group. Subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) using a central 
interactive voice response system (IVRS) and received study treatments for 6 months. Subjects in 
Group 1 received enoxaparin injections, warfarin tablets, and placebo apixaban tablets. Subjects in 
Group 2 received placebo enoxaparin injections, placebo warfarin tablets, and apixaban tablets. Total 
participation in the study for each subject was approximately 7 months (6 months on study treatment 
followed by a 30-day observation period). Subjects who met eligibility criteria assessed at screening 
and/or baseline were randomized and dispensed study drug on Day 1. Subjects were requested to 
return to the study site at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for study specific activities. 
CV185057 (Amplify-Ext) was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
subjects with symptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. Randomization was stratified by the type 
of disease treated (symptomatic proximal DVT only or symptomatic PE with or without DVT) and by the 
type of previous treatment (enoxaparin/warfarin in Study CV185056 [AMPLIFY], or standard anti-
coagulant therapy outside of Study CV185056 [AMPLIFY]). If a subject had both symptomatic DVT and 
symptomatic PE, the subject was stratified to the symptomatic PE group. After completing 
approximately 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of the index event, eligible

subjects were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 oral treatments twice daily (BID): apixaban 
2.5 mg, apixaban 5 mg, or placebo. Total participation in the study for each subject was approximately 
13 months (12 months on study treatment followed by a 30-day observation period). Subjects who 
met eligibility criteria assessed at screening and/or baseline were randomized and dispensed study 
drug on Day 1. Subjects were requested to return to the study site at Week 2 and at Months 3, 6, 9, 
and 12. Other visits at Months 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 were conducted either in person or by 
telephone contact. 
An on-going randomized, active-controlled (UFH/warfarin), parallel group, open-label study 
(B0661024, CV185160) in Japanese subjects (N=80) with acute symptomatic proximal DVT or PE 
being conducted in Japan is scheduled to be completed by June 2014. Study treatment and duration 
are similar to those in the CV185056 study. No efficacy data and minimal safety data from this study 
have contributed to the current application. 
CV185056 (AMPLIFY) and CV185057 (Amplify-Ext) 
Methods  
Study participants 
The in- and exclusion criteria for the population studied are appropriate to include patients that are 
representative of the population requiring at least 6 months of treatment for VTE. The low-risk patients 
with a provoked VTE without additional risk factors (eligible for less than 6 months therapy) were 
excluded from CV185056. According to current guidelines and practice, these patients would be treated 
for 3 months. Special conditions like subjects with a caval filter or subjects requiring 
thrombolysis/thrombectomy were also excluded. These high-risk patients are excluded in the SmPC. 
In order to provide data about efficacy in subjects presenting with either a DVT or a PE, the CV185056 
study pre-specified that approximately one third of the enrolled patients should have a PE and two 
thirds a DVT, a ratio that is consistent with the prevalence reported in the real world treatment 
population and therefore represents an appropriate DVT/PE population for analysis. 
Treatments 
In study CV185056, the comparator treatment was parenteral enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SC Q12h until INR 
≥ 2) and oral warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0). Several different LMWHs are available and guidelines do 
not distinguish among the various LMWHs provided they are used at their recommended doses. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of CV185056 was to determine if apixaban was non-inferior to standard 
enoxaparin/ warfarin therapy in the combined endpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) (nonfatal deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or nonfatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) 
or VTE-related death over 6 months of therapy. 
The primary objective of CV185057 was to determine if at least 1 of the apixaban dose regimens was 
superior to placebo in the combined endpoint of symptomatic, recurrent VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal 
PE or all-cause death in subjects who had an objectively documented index event of symptomatic 
proximal DVT or symptomatic PE, had completed approximately 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant 
therapy for the treatment of the index event, and had no objectively documented symptomatic 
recurrence of VTE after the index event.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary outcomes of Studies CV185056 and CV185057 were “VTE/VTE-related death” and 
“VTE/All-cause death” respectively. These are consistent with the Note for Guidance on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolic Disease 
(CPMP/EWP/563/98) and the protocols and statistical analysis plans were prospectively aligned with 
feedback from regulatory agencies. The outcomes were independently adjudicated using obvious 
definitions. Most endpoints are defined as composites; the components that are used may be subsets 
of components that are used in other endpoints. In this way, a large number of views is taken to a 
relatively small number of events. Although the components are clinically relevant, the additional value 
of all these composites is modest. 
Images were systematically adjudicated centrally. The protocols allowed short-term anticoagulant use 
before randomisation, thus creating some time for this process to occur; however this comes at the 
price of confounding the treatment effect by pre-randomisation anti-coagulants. The applicant has 
provided subgroup analyses to address this issue, see below. 
Sample size 
The sample size for CV185056 was computed for a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 as agreed with the 
FDA. Using the method of Farrington Manning with the assumption that 3% of subjects in the 
enoxaparin/warfarin group have VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE)/VTE-related death over 6 months of 
therapy, a sample size of 4094 subjects would have 90% power for a 1-sided α=0.025 non-inferiority 
test assuming true RR of 1. Although the assumptions in the sample size calculation were reasonable, 
it was still deemed necessary after blinded review to use the predefined provision to increase the 
sample size during the study based on a blinded interim analysis. The actual event rates were lower 
than assumed (apixaban: 0.0226; comparator: 0.0269; assumed: 0.03) making this change 
understandable. 
Randomisation 
The randomisation procedures were acceptable. An IVRS was used to manage randomisation, 
dispensing of trial medication and to provide sham INR values for apixaban-treated subjects in a 
blinded manner. There was a small number of dispensing errors (37 errors out of 54,720 kits assigned 
by IVRS; 0.07%). 
Blinding (masking) 
In study CV185056, the dosing of warfarin was individualized according to each patient's response as 
indicated by the international normalized ratio (INR), with the goal being to achieve and maintain an 
INR of 2.0 to 3.0. Apixaban has little effect on INR, and so measuring and reporting INR values openly 
could lead to unblinding of the study. Therefore, a shamming procedure was used to provide INR 
measurements while effectively concealing treatment assignment. A portable point-of-care INR 
measuring device was used, similar to that used in the CV185030 (ARISTOTLE) study. The IVRS was 
used to provide sham INR values for apixaban-treated subjects in a blinded manner. This INR sham 
procedure is currently the standard for double blind trials with a VKA comparator.  
Statistical methods 
In general the statistical approach was acceptable. A few highlights are shown below.

Non-inferiority margin 
The non-inferiority margin for study CV185056 was 1.8 for relative risk (RR) and 0.035 for risk 
difference (RD). Both criteria (RR and RD) were required for a successful study. In the scientific advice, 
CHMP had agreed to a non-inferiority margin of 2.0; the company chose the stricter 1.8 margin based 
on FDA feedback.

Study CV185057: Hochberg procedure  
The primary objective of study CV185057 was to determine if at least 1 of the apixaban doses was 
superior to placebo. The Hochberg procedure was used to maintain the 2-sided type I error at α = 
0.05. Superiority over placebo was claimed for a dose if the Hochberg adjusted p-value was ≤ 
0.05 and the RR was < 1. The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity between the two 
doses of apixaban in study CV185057.  
Missing data 
In line with the Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical Trials (EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 
Rev. 1), the Sponsor’s primary approach to missing data was to minimize missing data. Subjects 
discontinuing treatment were encouraged to complete any remaining study visits and were contacted 
by telephone to determine their primary efficacy and safety results if they did not withdraw consent. In 
addition, investigators were educated on the importance of minimizing missing observations. 
Sensitivity analyses specified in the statistical analysis plans for studies CV185056 and CV185057 
demonstrated that missing data did not impact the efficacy conclusions. 
For study CV185057, imputation of missing endpoint data was pre-specified for the primary efficacy 
analysis. In line with the above guidelines (Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical Trials 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev. 1), sensitivity analyses are typically performed to handle missing data 
rather than being the primary analysis. The Applicant agreed with the US FDA in January 2008 that for 
the primary analysis in study CV185057, subjects with missing efficacy endpoints were to be assessed 
as having had the event. In this study, subjects were considered to have had a missing endpoint if 1) 
they did not have an event during the intended treatment period and 2) it could not be substantiated 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 46/104 
 
 
 
 
 
that the endpoint did not occur during the intended treatment period (for example, if the subject 
withdrew consent or was lost to follow-up).  
Although the primary analysis in CV185057 has considered subjects with missing endpoint data as 
having had the event, the Applicant proposes to present non-imputed data in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The company has argued that the primary analysis (with imputations) is less relevant and of less 
interest to the prescriber, and that the secondary analysis (without imputations) generates data in a 
reliable manner.  
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of VTE/VTE-related death in study CV185056 was performed 
for the per protocol population also as pre-specified in the SAP and justified based on the non-
inferiority hypothesis. This analysis included subjects in the primary efficacy dataset minus those with 
any of the conditions pre-specified in the analysis plan. 
Results of study CV185056 (Amplify) 
Participant flow 
Approximately 86% of apixaban-treated subjects completed 6 months of study treatment compared to 
84.7% of subjects receiving enoxaparin/warfarin (Table E3). The proportions of subjects discontinuing 
study treatment during the 6-month treatment period that relate to DVT, PE, or other VTE are 
balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Discontinuations due to deaths, adverse events and other 
reasons are discussed under safety. Most subjects entered the 30-day follow-up period. Reasons for 
not completing the follow-up period are detailed in Table E3.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 27 August 2008 to 12 March 2013 at 358 centres world-wide. The 
trial took 4.5 years to completion. The average number of subjects per centre was 5395 / 358 = 15, or 
about one subject randomised in 3 months, which is low compared to the incidence of VTE. 
Conduct of the study 
Internal quality assurance audits were conducted at 24% of the sites in study CV185056 and 12% of 
the sites in study CV185057. Both study-specific vendors and company preferred providers were 
subjected to audits. Any suspected misconduct in any study was thoroughly investigated. For 1 case, 
at a site in India, data were excluded from efficacy and safety analyses because source data could not 
be verified (5 subjects in CV185056; 4 subjects in CV185057). No primary efficacy or safety outcomes 
were reported at this site for either study, and exclusions of these subjects would not affect the 
efficacy or safety conclusions of the studies. 
Baseline data 
Baseline parameters were balanced among treatment groups. Most participants were white (83%). 
There was adequate representation of patients from the EU (2118 = 39%). Older patients (>75 years) 
were sufficiently represented (n=774, 14.3%). 
Numbers analysed 
Subjects in this study (n=5395) had an objectively confirmed acute symptomatic proximal DVT 
(66.6%) or acute symptomatic PE (33.4%). 
A total of 16.1% of subjects in the apixaban group and 17.3% in the enoxaparin/warfarin group were 
excluded from the per protocol population, which was as expected (15% pre-specified in study 
protocol). Overall, the reasons for subjects being excluded from the per protocol population were 
similar in both treatment groups. There were no notable differences between the index event strata. 
The most frequent reason was treatment discontinuation (without an event having occurred, see later 
under Ancillary Analysis). 
The primary analysis imputes subjects with missing primary endpoint data as having an event. This is 
a conservative approach, as discussed above. Therefore all other populations are used for supportive 
analyses only. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In study CV185056, apixaban given at 10 mg BID for 7 days followed by 5 mg BID for 6 months 
demonstrated non-inferiority to the standard of care enoxaparin/warfarin (apixaban event rate of 
2.26%, enoxaparin/warfarin event rate of 2.69%; p-value (p)<0.0001) for the primary efficacy 
endpoint of VTE/VTE-related death (Table E4). The relative risk of VTE/VTE-related death for the 
apixaban-treated subjects was 0.84 compared to subjects treated with enoxaparin/warfarin, with an 
absolute risk difference of -0.44%. These results are corroborated by the corresponding Kaplan-Meier 
plot that shows overlapping lines for the initial 2 weeks of treatment followed by a clear numerical 
separation favouring apixaban that endures throughout the remainder of the treatment period 
(Figure E2).

According to the hierarchical testing sequence, superiority with respect to MB was then tested, and the 
results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in MB compared to enoxaparin/warfarin (p< 
0.0001). Subsequent testing for VTE/VTE-related death did not demonstrate superiority over 
enoxaparin/warfarin; no further hypothesis testing was performed per the hierarchical testing plan.

remain constant.

Efficacy at 3 months 
The risk of recurrent VTE is approximately 50% lower among patients whose VTE was provoked by a 
transient risk factor compared with patients who have an unprovoked VTE. This lower risk of 
recurrence has resulted in a recommendation by current treatment guidelines (ACCP, NICE, ESC) to 
discontinue anticoagulation after 3 months of treatment for patients who have a VTE provoked by a 
transient risk factor and do not have an ongoing risk factor for recurrence. 
Subjects with a provoked VTE, but without a risk factor for recurrence, may have required only 3 
months of anticoagulant therapy and were not enrolled.  
It is therefore of interest to assess the efficacy of apixaban at 3 months of treatment in the CV185056 
study. Table E5 summarizes the results of a post-hoc analysis, which demonstrate the efficacy of 
apixaban compared with enoxaparin/warfarin (nominal p-value < 0.0001 for inferiority) during the 
initial 90 days, which show comparable results to the main cohort.

Efficacy in the DVT and PE strata for VTE treatment 
The analysis by index event shows no relevant differences between the PE and DVT strata of the 
trial. This result confirms that apixaban is equally effective in the management of DVT as well as PE.

Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints are mainly driven by (or components of) the same VTE and mortality 
events that have driven the primary endpoint. These analyses confirm the consistency of the results 
and provide reassurance that classifying the events by diagnosis or severity during adjudication has 
not driven the outcomes in an unexpected way (Figure E4). Results for the composite endpoints of 
VTE/VTE-related death/MB and VTE/CV-related death/MI/stroke/MB/CRNMB were statistically 
significantly lower in the apixaban group, indicating a favourable benefit/risk profile compared to 
enoxaparin/warfarin.

Summary of Adjudicated Efficacy Endpoints that Occurred During the 
Ancillary analyses 
The effect of INR control on the relative efficacy of apixaban and warfarin  
Overall, subjects receiving warfarin were within the target therapeutic range (INR of 2.0-3.0) 60.9% 
(mean) of the time, which is consistent with recent VTE clinical trials that report a time in therapeutic 
range (TTR) of 58% [EINSTEIN], 60% [RECOVER], and 62.7% [EINSTEIN PE]. 
A centre-based analysis of VTE/VTE-related death was used to assess whether high or low TTR 
interacts with the treatment effects when comparing efficacy of apixaban with enoxaparin/warfarin. 
Subjects were not randomized to quartiles, but were in a quartile based on the degree of INR control at 
their investigative site. Centres were grouped by TTR quartiles based on a median TTR of 59.1%. 
This analysis demonstrated that the efficacy of apixaban relative to enoxaparin/warfarin was 
maintained across study sites regardless of TTR quartile (Figure E5). Within the highest quartile of TTR 
according to centre, the relative risk for apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 
1.61).

Although it is recognized that the AMPLIFY population did not have purely provoked events 
(=provoked events without additional risk factors), the results for VTE/VTE-related death according to 
the qualifying index events being provoked or unprovoked were consistent with the population as a 
whole. The RR point estimates for provoked (0.78) and unprovoked (0.82) VTE were both < 1 
compared to enoxaparin/warfarin. 
The most common reasons for exclusion of subjects from the pre-specified per protocol population 
were discontinuation of treatment before the end of the intended treatment period without having had 
a primary efficacy endpoint and < 80% compliance with study medication. In total, 434 (16.1%) 
apixaban-treated subjects and 469 (17.3%) enoxaparin/warfarin-treated subjects were excluded from 
the per protocol group. The per protocol analysis demonstrated that the overall efficacy results (events 
of VTE/VTE-related death, 32/2275 for apixaban, 48/2235 for enoxaparin/warfarin, RR of 0.66; p 
<0.0001 for non-inferiority) are consistent with the primary efficacy analysis. The event rates in the PP 
group were lower (as expected because the subjects actually used their effective therapies); the 
numerical advantage for apixaban was larger in the PP analysis. This confirms the robustness of the 
primary efficacy analysis. 
Subjects with missing endpoint data were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. As sensitivity 
analysis, 4 scenarios were investigated, in which all missing data in the treatments groups were 
imputed as having or not having the event (see Table E6). The scenarios 3 and 4 are unreasonable 
extremes, as the amount of missing endpoint data is roughly equal to the number of events. It is 
agreed with the Applicant that the sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the primary efficacy 
outcome.

In an analysis according to the extent of VTE, the numerical advantage of apixaban in event rate is 
evident in subjects with extensive disease, but not in all subjects with limited or moderate disease (see 
also subgroup analysis in Figure E6). The groups are small and confidence intervals for all these 
subgroups included 1, and the statistical interaction was not significant (p-value for interaction 0.057 
for PE and 0.28 for DVT)  
The relative risk for an outcome event was numerically in favour of apixaban regardless of prior 
heparin use. The confidence intervals for all these subgroups included 1, and the statistical 
interaction was not significant. 
Results for a number of subgroups are shown in the Figure E6. The result from the subgroup analysis 
by BMI deserves some attention as the interaction was almost statistically significant (p= 0.0639).

treated subjects discontinued due to bleeding (Table E7). The proportions of subjects completing 12 
months of study treatment are similar in subjects with a DVT compared to those with a PE at baseline. 
Most subjects entered the 30-day follow-up period whether or not the subject completed the 12 
months of study treatment. The primary reason for not completing the follow-up period in the 
apixaban 2.5 mg group (n=12, 1.4%), apixaban 5 mg group (n=11, 1.4%), and placebo group (n=7, 
0.9%) was withdrawal of consent. 
Discontinuations for all reasons are discussed in more detail in the safety section.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 16 May 2008 to 24 August 2012 at 328 centres worldwide. 
Baseline data 
Patients were balanced among treatment groups with respect to demographic characteristics. Most 
subjects were white (85%) and treated in the European Union (1182 = 48%). Older patients (≥75 
year: n=329, 13%) and overweight (32%)/obese (20%) subjects were adequately represented. 
The protocol excluded patients who had more than 12 months of anticoagulation planned for the most 
recent DVT or PE, (index event) and subjects with indications for long-term treatment with a VKA 
(such as mechanical valve, atrial fibrillation, multiple episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, documented 
anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-thrombin III deficiency, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, 
homozygous factor V Leiden, or homozygous prothrombin gene mutation.) 
Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analysis population in study CV185057 is all randomized subjects (Table E8). The 
treated population was used in the safety analyses. The analysis was by intention to treat. As

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In study CV185057, apixaban given at 2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID for 12 months demonstrated 
superiority to placebo for the primary efficacy analysis (with imputation) for the endpoint of VTE/all-
cause death. The event rates in the treatments groups were 0.0381 events/year (32/840), 0.0418 
(34/813), 0.1158 (96/829) for apixaban 2.5 mg BID, 5 mg BID or placebo respectively. The 
corresponding relative risks were 0.33 and 0.36 (p<0.0001). In the analysis without imputations the 
relative risks were even 0.24 and 0.19, based on event rates of 0.0226 (19 events), 0.0172 (14 
events) and 0.0929 (77 events). Results with no imputation gave the same p-value as the analysis 
with imputation (Table E9).

The Kaplan-Meier Plot (Figure E7) suggests that the event rates in both the placebo group and the 
active groups are constant. This is supportive of treatment continuation after one year if the indication 
(i.e. risk factors for recurrent VTE) persists.

The secondary endpoint analyses confirm efficacy in all predefined outcomes. The relative risks for all 
secondary endpoints for both apixaban doses are < 1 compared to placebo, which are consistent with 
and support the results of the primary endpoint (Figure E8).

Ancillary analyses 
Missing data 
Already the primary analysis was conservative with respect to missing data, as all missing data were 
imputed as having an event, which is unfavourable for apixaban. Other sensitivity analyses confirm the 
consistency of the results. Even the (apparently unreasonable) sensitivity analysis in which all missing 
data were interpreted in favour of placebo still showed a statistically significant benefit for apixaban. 
Provoked versus unprovoked 
The subgroup analyses with respect to whether the index event (6 months before randomisation) was 
provoked versus unprovoked, did not show important differences. In study CV185057, approximately 
90% of qualifying VTEs were reported as unprovoked. The 8.8% rate of VTE/VTE-related death 
observed over the 12-month period (median treatment duration of 359 days) following cessation of 
anticoagulant treatment (the placebo group in Figure ) was comparable to the approximately 10% 
annual rate observed in other studies in an unprovoked population and the 7.1% (median treatment 
duration of 265 days) in the rivaroxaban EINSTEIN EXT study. 
Prior therapy 
The subgroup analyses with respect to prior therapy did not show important differences between 
treatments. In the placebo groups some more events were noted after enoxaparin/warfarin when 
compared to prior treatment with apixaban. However, as there were no extra events after 'standard 
therapy', presumably LMWH/VKA also, this may be a chance finding.

Efficacy in the DVT and PE strata in study CV185057 
Results for the prevention of VTE recurrence for the DVT and PE strata are consistent with the 
population as a whole for VTE/all-cause death (Figure E9). 
Other subgroup analyses 
Analyses of VTE/all-cause death were performed for a number of subgroups (Figure E9). None of the 
subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant interaction. The estimates for the relative risk are 
all consistent with the main analysis and also the differences between the two apixaban dose levels 
were very small.

Design 
This was a randomized, active controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, triple-
dummy study in subjects with acute symptomatic proximal DVT or acute 
symptomatic PE. Randomization was stratified by the type of disease 
(symptomatic proximal DVT only or symptomatic PE with or without DVT) at 
baseline. If a subject had both symptomatic proximal DVT and symptomatic 
PE, the subject was stratified to the symptomatic PE group. Subjects were 
randomized (1:1 ratio) using a central interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) and received study treatments for 6 months. Subjects in Group 1 
received enoxaparin injections, warfarin tablets, and placebo apixaban 
tablets. Subjects in Group 2 received placebo enoxaparin injections, placebo 
warfarin tablets, and apixaban tablets. Total participation in the study for 
each subject was approximately 7 months (6 months on study treatment 
followed by a 30-day observation period). Subjects who met eligibility criteria 
assessed at screening and/or baseline were randomized and dispensed study 
drug on Day 1. Subjects were requested to return to the study site at Weeks 
2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for study specific activities.

Study identifier 
CV185057 (B0661002) (Amplify-Ext) 
Design 
This was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study in subjects with symptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. 
Randomization was stratified by the type of disease treated (symptomatic 
proximal DVT only or symptomatic PE with or without DVT) and by the type 
of previous treatment (enoxaparin/warfarin in Study CV185056 [Apixaban 
after the initial Management of Pulmonary embolism and deep vein 
thrombosis with First-line therapy {AMPLIFY}], apixaban in Study CV185056 
[AMPLIFY], or standard anti-coagulant therapy outside of Study CV185056 
[AMPLIFY]). If a subject had both symptomatic DVT and symptomatic PE, the 
subject was stratified to the symptomatic PE group. After completing 
approximately 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of 
the index event, eligible subjects were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
1 of 3 oral treatments twice daily (BID): apixaban 2.5 mg, apixaban 5 mg, or 
placebo. Total participation in the study for each subject was approximately 
13 months (12 months on study treatment followed by a 30-day observation 
period). Subjects who met eligibility criteria assessed at screening and/or 
baseline were randomized and dispensed study drug on Day 1. Subjects were 
requested to return to the study site at Week 2 and at Months 3, 6, 9, and 
12. Other visits at Months 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 were conducted either

Notes 
836 patients were also treated in CV185056 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy and safety for the VTE treatment and prevention indications have been investigated in 1 Phase 
2 study (CV185017) and 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (CV185056, AMPLIFY and CV185057, AMPLIFY EXT). 
Data provided by these studies address the key clinical questions with respect to determining the 
benefit/risk profile of apixaban compared to enoxaparin/warfarin in the acute treatment of VTE and the 
benefit/risk profile of apixaban compared to placebo for the prevention of recurrence of VTE over 
extended periods of therapy. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Comparators  
The combination of LMWH and VKA is the gold standard for treatment of VTE and the choice is in line 
with the NICE and ESC guidelines. The differences between the various LMWH products are small; the 
decision to choose enoxaparin is acceptable. Warfarin is globally the most commonly used VKA, and its 
choice is understandable. 
Given the high efficacy of the reference treatment, a non-inferiority design was appropriate. The non-
inferiority margin (relative risk of 1.8) was adapted to an FDA request and stricter than would have 
been required by EMA (e.g. in the scientific advice). This margin guarantees that the apixaban 
treatment preserves at least 50% of the effect of standard of care compared to placebo. 
The population studied was representative of the population requiring treatment for VTE for 6 
months, but two additional special sub-populations are noted. The low-risk patients with a provoked 
VTE without additional risk factors were excluded from CV185056 because they would only need 3 
months of treatment. Some subjects with active cancer were included in the trial. However, guidelines 
do not support the use of VKA in these patients as the standard of care; LMWH should have been used 
as the active comparator. Accordingly the efficacy findings cannot be interpreted for them. This is 
clarified in the SmPC.

The indication for prevention of recurrent VTE was addressed in CV185057 for an extended treatment 
period up to one year. The comparator for study CV185057 was placebo. This is acceptable, because at 
the time study CV185057 was initiated, no therapy other than a VKA was available for treatment 
beyond the initial 6-12 months. Because it was determined that the risk of bleeding with a VKA would 
offset the potential benefit of continued anticoagulation (had reached equipoise with respect to 
continuation or cessation of anticoagulant therapy), placebo was considered the appropriate 
comparator for this study. 
Only patients at clinical equipoise for treatment continuation could be included. This criterion appears 
to be somewhat poorly defined, but the investigators recruited a population with an annual risk of 
around 10% of VTE recurrence, which shows that there are benefits from this extended therapy. 
Patients, who clearly needed extended active prophylaxis, (e.g. patients with protein C or S 
deficiencies) were excluded from the trial. In the Xarelto (rivaroxaban) dossier, study 11899 is 
comparable to CV185057 (see EPAR of EMEA/H/C/000944/X/0010). In this rivaroxaban trial, 7.1 % of 
placebo patients had a primary outcome event. The event rate in the placebo group of CV185057 was 
9.3%, suggesting a somewhat higher risk population. The cause of this higher risk is not clear, as for 
66.3% in CV185057 no risk factor for VTE recurrence was reported, whereas in the rivaroxaban trial 
approximately 60% had had an idiopathic DVT/PE, but 16% had had more than one DVT/PE event, 14 
% had had a primary event during immobilisation, 8% had a known thrombophilic condition and 5% 
had active cancer, which are all risk factors for VTE. Thus, in the rivaroxaban trial, more subjects had 
recognised risk factors, whereas in the apixaban trial the risk was higher. It can be accepted that the 
apixaban patients were in ‘clinical equipoise’. 
Cancer patients were included as per clinical study protocol. This was justified by the applicant by the 
lack of data for such patients regarding the continuation of anticoagulation therapy after the initial 6 
months of treatment for DVT or PE to guide their physicians in continuing treatment. There are also no 
data regarding the treatment of patients whose cancer has resolved. This argumentation is not 
completely accepted. In clinical practice, patients with active cancer and a VTE event will be usually 
treated with LMWH for extended periods (see e.g. J Clin Oncol 25:5490-5505 or NICE VTE guideline p 
36/245). According to the exclusion criteria, patients who would be eligible for prolonged LMWH 
treatment are not in ‘clinical equipoise’ and are not expected in the trial. 
Statistical methods  
Hierarchical statistical testing 
The chosen method differs from the hierarchical testing discussed in the CHMP Scientific Advice 
EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/381523/2007 of 13 December 2007, where the superiority of apixaban over the 
comparator with regard to the endpoint of “all cause death or first recurrence of VTE” as a key 
secondary variable was planned to be tested in a confirmatory manner, only after non-inferiority has 
been shown with regard to the primary variable “VTE-related death or first recurrence of VTE”. Since 
the Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Venous 
Thromboembolic Disease (CPMP/EWP/563/98) guidance indicates all cause death or first recurrence of 
VTE is the most important analysis for superiority trials and VTE related death or first recurrence of 
VTE is the most important analysis for non-inferiority trials, the hierarchy was prospectively changed to 
focus on the latter in this non-inferiority trial. “All cause death or first recurrence of VTE” is retained as 
a secondary endpoint. 
The hierarchical statistical testing procedure adequately controls the family-wise Type I error rate. The 
most important safety outcome (major bleeding) is included here, which makes this measure 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 66/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
statistically more robust compared to assessment as a safety parameter alone. The deviation from the 
EMA scientific advice (focusing on VTE related death instead of all-cause mortality) is sufficiently 
justified by reference to the EMA VTE guideline. 
Missing data  
The methods used to handling of missing data in CV185056 is acceptable. Especially in a non-
inferiority trial, missing data may reduce the power of a trial making the issue of importance. 
Sensitivity analyses have been provided to support the estimations of effect size in the light of missing 
data. For study CV185056, missing endpoint data were imputed for sensitivity analyses only.  
Study CV185057  
Sample size  
The prediction of the event rates for the sample size calculation was conservative when compared to 
the event rates that finally occurred in the trial. This is understandable, as the target population is 
defined by the clinical equipoise criterion that is subjective. Based on the observed event rate in the 
placebo group (9.3%) the included population has a somewhat higher risk than assumed. 
The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity between the two doses of apixaban in 
study CV185057. This procedure adequately controls the type I error rate in this situation. 
The conduct of the trials appears to follow current standards. Blinding the VKA treatment required 
reporting of sham INRs to the investigator, which was implemented through the IVRS system. The 
sponsor has documented a very low number of errors in the medication dispensing process. The 
sponsor’s GCP Quality found GCP violations in some sites and eventually decided to close one site for 
lack of GCP compliance. This is interpreted positively in the sense, that the QA procedures were 
effective in finding and resolving the issue. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose Selection. 
The investigated dose in the phase 3 trials was based on the results of the phase 2 trial, but further 
adjusted through comparisons with other products and other indications. The currently proposed dose 
for the treatment of VTE is apixaban 10 mg orally twice daily, followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
until 6 months after the index event. This dose is well justified based on the efficacy data. The length 
of the initial phase of higher dose (10 mg BID) could be debated, and it cannot be excluded that a 
lower dose of apixaban e.g. between the third and the sixth month of therapy could be equally 
efficacious, however this is only speculation and the gain in safety that could be expected is small 
especially when compared to the clinical trial effort this would require. 
Results study CV185056. The primary endpoint of VTE/VTE-related death for treatment of VTE 
was non-inferior to standard therapy and in fact numerically superior although this result did not reach 
statistical significance.  
Subjects receiving warfarin were within the target therapeutic range (INR of 2.0-3.0) 60.9% (mean) of 
the time, which is consistent with recent VTE clinical trials that report a time in therapeutic range 
(TTR) of 58% [EINSTEIN], 60% [RECOVER], and 62.7% [EINSTEIN PE]. There were no clear trends in 
efficacy or safety in subgroup analyses based on TTR. 
The robustness of the results is supported by the per protocol analysis, sensitivity analyses addressing 
missing data and the secondary endpoints (including more measures of mortality). 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 67/104 
 
 
 
 
 
Most subgroup analyses also confirm the consistency of the results of the primary efficacy outcome. 
The subgroup analyses according to extent of VTE were inconsistent in the (small) subgroups with 
limited or moderate disease. There is no obvious mechanism, by which a therapy for more severe 
disease would not be effective in limited disease (unless the diagnosis would be different or wrong). In 
this issue, a chance finding is not unlikely. 
The result from the subgroup analysis by BMI deserves some attention as the interaction was almost 
statistically significant (p= 0.0639). Surprisingly, the relative efficacy was lower in the low BMI group, 
although one would expect the highest concentrations of apixaban in this group while the VKA dose 
would be weight-corrected through INR titration. These findings may also be attributable to chance.  
The low-risk patients with a provoked VTE without additional risk factors were excluded from 
CV185056 because they would only need 3 months of treatment. Although efficacy in these low risk 
patients is not directly investigated in this study, the applicant is explicitly including these patients in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC: "As per available medical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 
months) should be based on transient risk factors (e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation)." 
The population that should be treated for merely 3 months has lower risk of recurrence than the 
population included in the trial. However, a product that is effective in a situation of high risk of 
thrombus formation (like unprovoked VTE) could also be assumed effective in a situation of low risk of 
thrombus formation or when the ‘provoking factor’ persists. 
The Kaplan Meijer curves for VTE events are clearly separated at 3 months already, favouring 
apixaban. It follows directly from the observations made in the previous paragraph that the relative 
risk of VTE/VTE-related death is also numerically favourable for apixaban at 3 months. See the Safety 
section for the risk of adverse events in this subgroup. 
The subgroup analyses (after 6 months) of subjects with provoked events further support this 
approach. Compared to enoxaparin/warfarin, the relative risk of VTE/VTE related death was 0.77 (95% 
CI: 0.29, 2.08; 7/261 v 9/263 events); the relative risk of Major Bleeding was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.11, 
1.58; 3/270 v 7/268 events). 
The wording regarding short-term treatment in the proposed SmPC is similar to the approved SmPC of 
rivaroxaban. However, in the rivaroxaban study 11702, investigators were asked to determine 
treatment duration (3, 6 or 12 months) prior to randomisation. For subjects with 3 months intended 
treatment duration, 208 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban and 203 patients to enoxaparin/VKA 
and primary outcome events were 5 (2.4%) and 3 (1.5%) respectively. Thus, rivaroxaban has 
addressed the 3-months treatment in the trial, while apixaban has not, but based on the data provided 
the extrapolation can be accepted. 
The inclusion of (active) cancer patients may be considered controversial, because they may qualify 
for a different therapeutic approach, e.g. long-term LMWH instead of VKA. A history of cancer was 
present in 518 (9.7%) and active cancer in 142 (2.6 %) of treated subjects. In the CSR, a subgroup 
analysis of all cancer patients is not presented, but according to Table 14.2.3.1.3.12 in the CSR, the 
efficacy was maintained in subjects without active cancer (relative risk 0.8581 (95% CI: 0.6036, 
1.2201)). The results were not driven by the active cancer patients, which is reassuring. However, 
application of the results to the patients with active cancer is not possible, as the comparator is 
considered suboptimal. This is addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC as highlighted below. 
Patients with active cancer  
Efficacy and safety of apixaban in the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE (VTEt) in patients with active cancer have not been established.

Results study CV185057.  
In this study, apixaban given at 2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID for 12 months demonstrated superiority to 
placebo for the primary efficacy analysis (with imputations) for the endpoint of VTE/all-cause death. 
The event rates in the treatments groups were significantly lower than those recorded in the placebo 
group. The secondary endpoint analyses confirm efficacy in all predefined outcomes. The primary 
analysis can actually be seen as a sensitivity analysis, but efficacy was maintained in even more 
conservative other sensitivity analyses, underscoring that these results are very robust.  
Proposed dosing regimen 
The proposed dose for this indication is 2.5 BID. The efficacy differences between the two dose levels 
are not clinically relevant and it is agreed with the Applicant to choose between doses based on safety 
arguments. 
The applicant addressed the issue of recommending more flexible dosing in the labelling, i.e a dose 
lower than 5 mg BID after 3 months, or higher than 2.5 mg doses after 6 months. For the initial 
period, available data from other anticoagulant studies show that a higher anticoagulant activity is 
needed to ensure effective dissolving of the thrombus/prevention of extension. This partly supports the 
5 mg BID dose for the first 6 months. However, the important issue is that any newly proposed dose 
reduction/increase would be based on theoretical assumptions as only the currently proposed doses 
were investigated in studies CV185-056/57 with the shown benefit risk profile. This applies also to data 
pertaining to the use of 5 mg BID further than 6 months. This was not investigated, and the dose 
advice should be adapted to clearly indicate that this dose should be used for 6 months and not longer. 
A definite advice regarding possible alternative dosing in specific subgroups in the first 6 months, or 
later is not supported due to lack of clinical data.  
The approved recommendation in the SmPC section 4.2 reads as follows:  
[…] 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) 
The recommended dose of Eliquis for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg taken 
orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available medical 
guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk factors 
(e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). 
The duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment 
benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  
Dose adjustment in special populations (low body weight, patients above 75 years and 
severe renal impairment) 
Upon request from CHMP, the MAH provided clarifications regarding individual benefit/risk of continued 
prophylaxis depending on the characteristics of the patient. Subjects ≥75 years, subjects with (mild, 
moderate, severe) renal insufficiency and subjects with BMI ≤ 28 kg/m2 have an increased relative risk 
of bleeding events compared to placebo, according to the subgroup analyses. A summary is provided 
in the tables and figures below.

*Patients with at least two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum 
creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) 
The presented data cannot robustly conclude on a positive or negative  B/R of apixaban in specific 
vulnerable populations like patients above 75 years, low weight (< 60 kg), moderate/severe renal 
impairment or the combination of these risks. This is due to the limited representation of these 
subgroups in the clinical trial and also the few events recorded for efficacy and safety. Importantly, a 
higher bleeding risk cannot be excluded, as shown in figure 2. The applicant proposed some 
modifications in the SmPC to warn against such bleeding risk. Further modifications were implemented 
to clearly inform the prescribers about the associated risks, which are considered acceptable to convey 
the associated risks. The finally agreed SmPC text for the different indications is presented below.  
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section5.2) 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following 
recommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): 
- for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment of 
DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) apixaban is to be used with 
caution; 
- for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should receive 
the lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. 
Patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body 
weight ≤ 60 kg should also receive the lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. 
In patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no 
clinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Body weight 
VTEp and VTEt - No dose adjustment required (see section 4.4 and 5.2). 
NVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at 
the beginning of section 4.2). 
Presentation of data in the SmPC section 5.1 
The Applicant proposes to present non-imputed data in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The percentage of 
missing data is 2.1% and is of the same magnitude as the number of events in the apixaban study 
arms, but relatively small compared to the placebo groups. Therefore, the question of whether or not 
to report imputed data does have some impact on the presentation of the results. As per the SmPC 
guideline 2009, the primary analysis should be included in the SmPC, in this case the imputed data. 
However, it can be agreed with the applicant that such analysis is very conservative, and the non-
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014

imputed data could form the basis of the primary analysis. It is also more informative to inform the 
prescriber with the actual data. In conclusion, the argumentation of the Applicant is agreed and the 
inclusion of non-imputed data from CV185057 in section 5.1 of the SmPC is acceptable. To avoid 
confusion, there is no need to also include the imputed data, which are considered of little relevance to 
the prescriber. This decision is also in line with the approved SmPC for other new oral anticoagulants, 
where no imputed data are discussed. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of apixaban in VTE, for both treatment and recurrence prevention is robustly supported by 
the results of the submitted clinical trials. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The main safety consideration for all antithrombotic agents is bleeding. There is little evidence that FXa 
inhibitors are associated with off-target class effects. Safety information is available for more than 
60,000 treated subjects in the apixaban clinical development program who were administered 
apixaban or comparators from 16 completed or on-going Phase 2/3 studies across a number of 
indications. Apixaban has been approved for the prevention of VTE following surgery for knee and hip 
replacement and for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular 
AF, indications which imply long-term usage. The safety discussion is an extension of the data that 
have emerged from the experience with apixaban in these other indications.  
Adjudicated bleeding events were the primary safety focus in the VTE treatment Phase 2 and 3 
studies. Methods for collection and reporting of AEs were similar for all studies, as was oversight by an 
independent, unblinded DSMB. Bleeding events, thrombocytopenia, MI, stroke, and cause of death 
were adjudicated in a blinded manner by the same ICAC responsible for adjudication of efficacy events. 
In studies CV185056 and CV185057, all-cause death was a secondary efficacy endpoint for the efficacy 
populations and is presented in the efficacy analyses. Death was also a safety endpoint in the treated 
population. 
Certain key safety events were prospectively identified as being of special clinical interest based on 
prior experience with apixaban in the clinical program and the experience of drugs in the same 
therapeutic class. These events included MI, non-haemorrhagic stroke, thrombocytopenia, AEs related 
to elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and neurologic AEs of interest.  
To assess neurological safety, the Sponsors developed a customized, broad list of neurologic 
MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) to facilitate identification of potential cases of concern. 
Intensive surveillance of hepatic safety in the apixaban VTE treatment clinical program was 
conducted. This enhanced surveillance program resulted in a comprehensive clinical safety database 
encompassing both clinical laboratory test results and liver-related AEs. Cases meeting pre-specified 
criteria were sent to a panel of independent hepatologists for assessment in a blinded manner. 
MI and non-hemorrhagic stroke were examined for evidence of an increased frequency during 
treatment or during the first 30 days of discontinuing study drug. 
Patient exposure 
Data for the phase 2 and two pivotal phase 3 trials in this application were not pooled, because of 
important differences in design of the two trials (duration and comparator). The exposure data are 
shown in Table S1a and b. According to tables not shown here (SCS table 8 and table 9), exposure for

24 to <26 weeks in CV185056 was 1630 patients for apixaban and 1572 patients for active 
comparator. The median exposure in CV185057 was 360 days in both treatment groups, implying that 
more than 400 patients in each group were exposed for at least one year.

In direct comparison to enoxaparin/warfarin, apixaban was numerically and statistically significantly 
superior with respect to bleedings. Major bleedings (MB) were included in the hierarchical testing for 
the primary efficacy endpoint. A 69% reduction in adjudicated MB (p-value for superiority < 0.0001) 
was demonstrated for apixaban treatment compared with enoxaparin/warfarin (Figure S1). Statistically 
significantly decreased bleeding frequency based on nominal p-values in the adjudicated clinically 
relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), MB/CRNMB, minor bleeding, and total bleeding was observed 
for apixaban compared with enoxaparin/warfarin. The Kaplan-Meijer curves for bleeding (Figure S1) 
separate early, visualizing that the superior bleeding profile of apixaban compared to 
enoxaparin/warfarin is also clinically relevant for the 3-months treatment indication that is sought but 
not investigated in a separate trial.

81 (3.0%)]) were similar or lower in the apixaban group compared to the enoxaparin/warfarin group 
with the exception of minor bleeding in the uterus (24 apixaban, 15 enoxaparin/warfarin).  
Based on the centre-based analysis based on TTR quartile, a reduced risk of MB was demonstrated for 
apixaban relative to enoxaparin/warfarin regardless of TTR quartiles. The advantage in bleedings was 
also similar across all TTR ranges.  
The advantage in bleedings was similar across the subgroups tested (Figure S3), confirming the 
robustness of this finding. No treatment by subgroup interaction was statistically significant.

Bleeding in study CV185057 
Figure S4 summarizes all adjudicated bleeding endpoints in study CV185057. No fatal bleeding events 
occurred in any treatment group. 
Compared to placebo, the adjudicated bleeding endpoints for apixaban 2.5 mg BID were numerically 
higher (but not significantly different) from placebo. For apixaban 5 mg BID, the frequency of 
MB/CRNMB in the apixaban 5 mg BID group was not significantly different from the placebo group, 
whereas the frequency of CRNMB, minor bleeding, and total bleeding was higher than the placebo 
group, suggesting a higher risk of non-major bleeding in the apixaban 5 mg BID group compared to 
placebo. A Kaplan-Meier plot for MB/CRNMB is provided in Figure S5. As could be expected, the risk of 
bleeding was dose dependant in CV185057. For ‘total bleeding’, the relative risks between the 
apixaban 2.5 and 5 mg and placebo were 1.25 and 1.66 respectively; corresponding to absolute risk 
differences of 2.0 and 5.3% respectively. However, for the much more relevant MB/CRNMB the 
absolute differences were 0.5 and 1.5% respectively.

a similar distribution of bleeding events among the anatomical sites was noted for the apixaban 2.5 mg 
BID, apixaban 5 mg BID, and placebo groups. 
Figure S6 shows that the RR for MB/CRNMB for all subgroups are generally consistent with the study 
population as a whole. None of the interaction values were statistically significant.

Three cases of deaths related to acute MI were recorded in study cv185056 (see AR for more details). 
These are offset by 1 versus 2 cases of myocardial infarction (not coded as acute). The total for cardiac 
disorders was 10 vs. 7. Of the three cases, the circumstances of case 166-1440 are only poorly 
documented as the family refused to share all information with the investigator. The death certificate 
noted ‘cardiogenic shock’. The second case (207-2239) occurred on Day 7 of apixaban treatment and 
was associated with rectal bleeding and pulmonary embolism at the same moment. The third case 
(712-1723) occurred 11 days after completion of the planned 6-months treatment. The patients also 
suffered from type-2 diabetes.  
Liver safety 
Based on the experience with ximelagatran, the Applicant has implemented an extensive system for 
evaluation of potential liver toxicity. Liver safety in the VTE treatment clinical program includes pooled 
analyses of liver enzymes and liver-related AEs.  
Overall, most LFT elevations were asymptomatic and without clinical sequelae. SAEs related to LFT 
elevations with onset during the treatment period were reported for 13 (0.3%) subjects in the 
apixaban group and 17 (0.5%) subjects in the comparator group (Table 4.12.3.2, SCS tables). The 
only SAEs reported in at least 2 subjects in either treatment group were hepatic function abnormal 
(apixaban: 2 subjects), liver function test abnormal (apixaban: 2 subjects), drug-induced liver injury 
(apixaban: 2 subjects), hepatic failure (comparator: 2 subjects), and hepatitis (comparator: 2 
subjects). 
A panel of independent hepatologists provided blinded assessments of subjects with concurrent 
elevations of ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN and/or pre-selected SAEs (jaundice, 
hepatitis, and hepatic failure). Two SAEs in Study CV185057 with onset during the treatment period 
were assessed as possibly related to apixaban treatment by the panel of independent hepatologists.  
In Study CV185056, one non-serious AE of concurrent elevations of ALT >3 x ULN and total bilirubin 
>2 x ULN reported in a 60-year-old female subject with a history of cholelithiasis who received 
apixaban 5 mg BID, was considered to be probably related to apixaban treatment by the panel of 
independent hepatologists.

Most drugs that are associated with drug induced liver injury (DILI) are also associated with an 
increased frequency of asymptomatic elevation of ALT > 3 x ULN. In the Phase 3 VTE treatment 
studies, the frequency of ALT > 3 x ULN elevations was lower in the apixaban group compared with the 
comparator group. In Study CV185017, the frequency of ALT elevations > 3 x, 5 x, or 10 x ULN was 
similar in the apixaban and comparator (placebo) group, suggesting no increased risk of ALT elevation 
due to apixaban. There were few outliers (peak ALT > 3xULN, peak Bili > ULN), in both the apixaban 
and comparator treatment groups (4 subjects in each group). 
Among the 212 (5.1%) subjects in the apixaban group and 339 (10.1%) subjects in the comparator 
group with AEs related to LFT elevations, 9 (0.2%) subjects in the apixaban group and 19 (0.6%) 
subjects in the comparator group discontinued treatment because of the AE.  
Liver toxicity is addressed in the RMP. “Transient elevation of liver enzymes” should be included as an 
important identified risk for the VTEp indication, based on the findings of the increase in liver enzyme 
values in the pivotal clinical studies. “Liver injury” is currently included as an important potential risk 
for the other indications of apixaban (except VTEp) which is based on cases from the clinical trial 
program reporting liver injury. For these cases a relationship to the study medication could not 
definitively be excluded, which means that “liver injury” should be classified as an important potential 
risk. However, the Rapporteur is of the opinion that this should be applied to all indications, and 
therefore  “liver injury” should be added as an important potential risk to the VTEp indication as well. 
Neurologic events of interest 
One case of post treatment Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and 1 case of Guillain Barre Syndrome 
(GBS) were reported in subjects who received apixaban in the VTE treatment studies. In both cases 
the neurology consultants judged the event as not likely related to apixaban.  
One case of ALS was reported post treatment in Subject CV185057-136-308 who prematurely 
discontinued study medication in the apixaban 2.5 mg treatment group in Study CV185057. The 
neurologist consultants concluded that the subject’s ALS symptoms were present prior to study onset, 
and the relationship to blinded study drug (apixaban) was assessed as not likely.  
The narrative of the potential case of GBS is provided in the AR. The investigator judged the event to 
be possibly related to study drug. The neurologist consultants considered the relationship to blinded 
study drug (apixaban) as not likely related. 
Review of the pooled database across all apixaban studies, identified a very low incidence of neurologic 
AEs of special interest. (17 of more than 57,000 subjects in apixaban or comparator arms) observed in 
15 completed, concluded, and ongoing studies across multiple indications (Appendix 13.7, VTEp SCS): 
•  GBS n = 6 (apixaban 3, comparator 3) 
•  ALS n = 3 (apixaban 2, comparator 1) 
•  Other acute polyneuropathies n = 8 (apixaban 2, comparator 6) 
Review of these cases identified the frequencies of the events to be similar in the apixaban and 
comparator groups, with no features suggesting a causative role of apixaban. 
Based on the total frequency of GBS, ALS and other acute polyneuropathies, no increase of risk can be 
concluded.

Upon  request  from  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  has  provided  the  information  having  reanalysed  the  data  for 
any  rebound  effect.  The  reanalysis  does  not  suggest  a  clear  rebound  phenomenon  especially  for 
occurrence of MI or stroke although there is a trend for VTE events.  
The applicant has argued that withdrawal effect is a recognised phenomenon with factor Xa inhibitors 
and cited another example.  
While there is some similarity between different drugs in the same class, it is still of some concern that 
remains a risk. 
It  would  have  been  useful  for  the  applicant  to  have  evaluated  the  specifics  of  the  risk  in  those  with 
recurrent events in  comparison to those with no such events to discern potential differences and this 
should be for further follow up through the PSURs.

Deaths 
A summary of the deaths that occurred during the intended treatment period and in the follow-up 
period for Study CV185056 is provided in Table S5. Event rates for the adjudicated efficacy endpoint 
of all-cause death were similar for both treatment groups. A similar proportion of subjects experienced 
an SAE with an outcome of death during the treatment period in the apixaban (1.4%) and 
enoxaparin/warfarin (1.6%) treatment groups. A Summary of SAEs with an outcome of death that 
occurred during the treatment period in CV185056 is presented in Table S6. Among the SAEs with 
outcome of death in CV185056, 3 cases of acute myocardial infarction are noted and none in the 
comparator group (Table S5). These are discussed before.

Serious Adverse Events 
The overall frequency of SAEs with onset during the treatment period was similar in the apixaban and 
comparator treatment groups in studies CV185017 and CV185056. There was a higher rate of SAEs in 
the placebo group (19.1%) compared to both apixaban treatment groups (13.3% and 13.2% in the 
apixaban 2.5 mg and apixaban 5 mg treatment groups, respectively) in Study CV185057. 
DVT and PE were among the most frequently reported SAEs in studies CV185056 and CV185057. 
There was a higher rate of these SAEs in the comparator groups compared with the apixaban groups in 
both studies. These SAEs were also included in the efficacy analyses.

The frequency of treatment-related SAEs in the VTE treatment studies was low with a large proportion 
only being reported in 1 subject. The proportion of subjects who experienced a treatment related SAE 
in studies CV185056 and CV185057 was higher in the comparator groups compared with the apixaban 
groups. 
A summary of the most frequently reported (>1%) SAEs reported in the Phase 3 efficacy and safety 
study, CV185056, with onset during the treatment period is presented in Table S9. Similar 
proportions of subjects in the apixaban (15.6%) and enoxaparin/warfarin (15.2%) treatment groups 
experienced an SAE with onset during the treatment period. No SAEs were reported in >1% of 
subjects in the apixaban treatment group, and PE and DVT were the only events reported in >1% of 
subjects in the enoxaparin/warfarin treatment group (1.4% and 1.2%, respectively). Review of SAEs 
by index event strata did not reveal any difference between treatment groups.

The proportion of subjects who experienced an SAE considered related to treatment by the investigator 
was lower in the apixaban treatment group (1.8%) compared with the enoxaparin/warfarin group 
(3.3%) (Table 14.3.2.2.1.7, CV185056 CSR). The only treatment-related SAEs reported in >0.1% of 
subjects were gastrointestinal hemorrhage (apixaban 5 mg: 0.2% and enoxaparin/warfarin: 0.4%) and 
hematuria (apixaban 5 mg: 0.1% and enoxaparin/warfarin: 0.4%). 
A summary of the most frequently reported (>0.1%) SAEs reported in the Phase 3 efficacy and safety 
study, CV185057, with onset during the treatment period is presented in Table S10. There was a 
higher rate of SAEs in the placebo group (19.1%) compared to both apixaban treatment groups 
(13.3% and 13.2% in the apixaban 2.5 mg and apixaban 5 mg treatment groups, respectively). This 
difference was seen consistently in both index event strata (DVT and PE). The most frequently 
reported SAEs (>1% in any treatment group) with onset during the treatment period were DVT 
(apixaban 2.5 mg: 0.4%, apixaban 5 mg: 1.1%, and placebo: 4.8%) and PE (apixaban 2.5 mg: 0.6, 
apixaban 5 mg: 0.4%, and placebo: 2.4%). The cases of DILI are discussed above.

The proportion of subjects who experienced an SAE considered related to treatment by the investigator 
was low in all treatment groups (0.7% in the apixaban 2.5 mg treatment group, 1.4% in the 
apixaban 5 mg treatment group, and 1.2% in the placebo group) (Table 14.3.2.2.1.7, CV185057 CSR). 
The treatment-related SAEs reported in >0.1% of subjects were hematemesis (apixaban 2.5 mg 
treatment group only: 0.2%), anemia (apixaban 5 mg treatment group only: 0.2%), hematuria 
(apixaban 5 mg: 0.2%, placebo: 0.1%, and not reported in apixaban 2.5 mg treatment group), eye 
hemorrhage (placebo group only: 0.2%), and deep vein thrombosis (placebo group only: 0.2%). 
Laboratory findings 
The analysis of laboratory findings did not uncover new or relevant findings. There are no relevant 
differences in laboratory values between apixaban and comparator treatments. Most notably, there 
were no findings with respect to liver enzymes (see above). 
Safety in special populations 
The subgroup analyses (see above) addressed the question of whether there were subgroups in which 
the safety profile of apixaban was markedly different from that observed in each of the overall studies. 
The results of the subgroup analyses suggest that the bleeding and overall AE profile of apixaban 
compared to enoxaparin/warfarin (Study CV185056) or placebo (Study CV185057) are similar to the 
overall profiles observed for the overall population in each study.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
For interactions, only antiplatelet drugs were separately analysed in the pivotal trials. The data show 
that the combination of an antiplatelet drug and apixaban is associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding (relative risk: 2.8); the relative risk in comparison to enoxaparin/warfarin is not affected: 
Apixaban’s RR compared to enoxaparin/warfarin for MB was 0.30 for subjects taking an antiplatelet 
and 0.31 for subjects not taking an antiplatelet. As with the other analyses of bleeding, the risk of 
bleedings during apixaban compares very favourably to the risk during enoxaparin/warfarin use. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In CV185056 no pattern for discontinuations related to AEs could be found, except for events related 
to VTE and bleeding. AEs related to discontinuation were 162/2676 (6.1%) for apixaban and 199/2689 
(7.4%) for enoxaparin/warfarin. These data provide no new insights. 
In CV185057 the vast majority of AE related discontinuations were related to VTE. There were some 
(0.4%) discontinuations because of headache. The number of treated subjects who discontinued due to 
AEs was lower in the apixaban treatment groups (67/840 (8.0%) and 61/811 (7.5%) in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 89/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
apixaban 2.5 mg and apixaban 5 mg treatment groups, respectively) compared to the placebo group 
134/826 (16.2%). 
Post marketing experience 
No new insights are gained from the post marketing experience. 
Since receiving its first marketing authorization on 18 May 2011, 404 spontaneous reports including 
607 AEs have been received by the sponsor through 17 May 2013; 321 of these reports were Health 
Professional confirmed (SCS Section 2.7.4.6.2). Of the spontaneously reported cases, 165 met criteria 
to be classified as serious and 4 cases had a fatal outcome (all HP-confirmed). 
The most common types of AEs represented some form of haemorrhage, which is expected. The 
second most common type of event represented sequelae of the underlying indication, for example, 
PE, drug ineffective, or thrombosis. Two liver-related events were reported (Hepatocellular injury and 
Transaminases increased). Neither case suggested any significant liver-related risk associated with 
apixaban use. 
Ancillary analyses 
The analysis of efficacy and safety to Day 9 in Study CV185056 confirms the safety of the initially 
higher dose in VTE treatment. These data are of visualised in the Kaplan Meijer curves for the primary 
endpoint (Figure E2) and for bleedings (Figure S1), which are superimposed or in favour of apixaban 
from the start. 
The selection of an initial 7-day treatment period with the higher 10 mg BID dose of apixaban was 
designed to ensure that subjects received maximum benefit during the hypercoagulable state following 
initial clot formation in stabilizing the clot and preventing a potentially fatal VTE. To establish that this 
benefit was achieved without a cost of unacceptable bleeding, both VTE/VTE-related death and 
adjudicated bleeding endpoints were analyzed for the first 9 days of study CV185056 (7 days of 
apixaban 10 mg BID plus 2 days of apixaban 5 mg BID). 
During the first 9 days, events of VTE / VTE-related death were 19/2659 for apixaban and 25/2676 for 
enoxaparin/warfarin; relative risk 0.7661 [0.4228, 1.3879]. For MB/CRNMB, events were 27 
(apixaban) versus 66 (LMWH/VKA), Risk difference -0.0130 [-0.0198, -0.0063]. 
2.5.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
The presented exposure numbers are considered sufficient to characterise the safety profile in the 
sought indications. 
No specific trends were observed in the three major groups participating in study CV185057 (switchers 
from SOC vs switchers from enox/VKA and patients already on apixaban from study CV185056), 
except from a lower bleeding in switchers from enox/VKA. However, it can be agreed that the groups 
are of limited numbers, complicating interpretation of the results. Current recommendations in the 
SmPC for switching between different anti-coagulants were considered adequate by the CHMP. 
The key safety issue for an anti-coagulant is bleeding. In the adjudicated class of bleeding, most 
notably major bleedings and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (but also total bleeding), apixaban 
was superior to enoxaparin/VKA in VTE treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 90/104 
 
 
 
 
 
TTR  
Based on the centre-based analysis based on TTR quartile, a reduced risk of MB was demonstrated for 
apixaban relative to enoxaparin/warfarin regardless of TTR quartiles. The advantage in bleedings was 
also similar across all TTR ranges. The results are somewhat surprising, as centres with worse INR 
control did not have more bleedings in the control group. Presented data further confirms the lack of 
correlation between center TTR and the reported events in the warfarin group; there is also no 
statistical interaction. It can be due to the limited sample size in each group and that the study is not 
powered to show such differences. Similar observations were also shown in the Einstein study for 
rivaroxaban. 
In the VTE recurrence prevention indication, the differences with placebo were small, especially for the 
lower 2.5 mg dose, and the number of major bleeding events was low. 
No new safety signals have been identified in the VTE treatment studies. The Applicant has searched 
for evidence of rebound phenomena after study drug discontinuation. In this respect, no differences 
were found in comparison to enoxaparin/warfarin. Further analysis of the data does not suggest a clear 
rebound phenomenon especially for occurrence of MI or stroke although there is a trend for VTE 
events. The applicant has argued that withdrawal effect is a recognised phenomenon with factor Xa 
inhibitors. While there is some similarity between different drugs in the same class, it was still 
considered of some concern in view of the CHMP. It would have been useful for the applicant to have 
evaluated the specifics of the risk in those with recurrent events in comparison to those with no such 
events to discern potential differences and this should be for further follow up. Issue is resolved with 
further follow-up in the PSURs.    
Regarding MI, there are numerical imbalances in occurrence of MI in study CV185056. Based on 
further assessments the results from the study-CV185056 appears to be the only one among the 
apixaban clinical program with a suggestion of increased events. It is not possible to judge whether 
this difference from other studies signifies a true risk or is a chance finding. The issue can be solved by 
further follow-up in the PSURs.  
Consistent with the safety profile established in previous apixaban clinical studies, there was no 
evidence of hepatotoxicity, neurologic toxicity, increased risk of non-bleeding adverse events, or 
laboratory test abnormalities. 
Hepatotoxicity  
Two SAEs in Study CV185057 were assessed as possibly related to apixaban treatment by the panel of 
independent hepatologists. The assessment is appropriate, as in the first case ciprofloxacin use could 
provide an alternate explanation and in the second case the study drug was restarted uneventfully 
some days after the event had resolved. 
Overall, the clinical experience with apixaban in studies CV185017, CV185056, and CV185057 supports 
the hepatic safety of apixaban for VTE treatment. There is no evidence that apixaban causes drug-
induced liver injury based on data for 4712 subjects treated with apixaban in the single Phase 2 and 2 
Phase 3 VTE treatment studies. Likewise, review of the liver safety profile across all apixaban 
indications indicates that apixaban is not associated with drug-induced hepatotoxicity, regardless of 
apixaban dose, treatment duration, or study population. Based on the above data , “liver injury” is 
considered an important potential risk for all indications of apixaban. 
Safety in certain subgroups. Study CV185056  
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 91/104 
 
 
 
 
 
The advantage in bleedings was similar across the subgroups tested (Figure S3). No treatment by 
subgroup interaction was significant. The dose recommendations in special subgroups is addressed 
above. 
Bleeding in study CV185057. 
The Forest plot presented in figure S6, shows a higher bleeding risk in some subpopulations, though 
not associated with a significant interaction. These include patients ≥75 years , patients with different 
degrees of renal insufficiency and for low-weight subjects ≤ 60 kg. Presented data cannot robustly 
conclude on a positive or negative B/R of apixaban in such specific vulnerable populations. This is due 
to the limited representation of these subgroups in the clinical trial and also the few events recorded 
for efficacy and safety. Importantly, a higher bleeding risk cannot be excluded. The applicant proposed 
some modifications in the SmPC to warn against such bleeding risk. These are not considered 
sufficient. For each of these groups (>75 years, <60 kg and severe renal impairment) more clear and 
specific warnings regarding the limited clinical data and that apixaban should be used with caution due 
to the higher bleeding risk are warranted. This could clearly inform the prescribers about the 
associated risks. See SmPC assessment. 
As presented in tables S11 and S12, there is adequate representation of patients from 65 to 75 years, 
but quite limited for patients above 85 years. In both studies, the rate of AEs increases with age in 
both the apixaban and the comparator group, which is expected. In general the data does not point to 
any consistent problems in the older age groups administered apixaban. However, there is a trend for 
more fatal and serious events recorded in the apixaban group in the 75-84 years group. On the other 
hand, in the oldest group, there are 9 fatal cases recorded with enoxaparin/warfarin and none in the 
apixaban, and also the serious events were more frequently recorded in the former group. 
No post-marketing events were identified that altered the established safety profile of apixaban. 
2.5.2 Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of apixaban is well-established. In the indication of VTE treatment, safety in terms of 
bleeding was superior to enoxaparin/warfarin. In the indication of VTE recurrence prevention, the 
numbers of bleeding events are low, but obviously more than placebo. The safety of the 2.5 mg BID 
dose in the latter indication compares favourably to the 5 mg BID dose, supporting its choice as 
recommended dose.

Risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information and user test 
Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4. 5.1 and 6.5 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH applied for a variation to add a new pack size of 28 film coated tablets for Eliquis 
5mg strength (SmPC section 6.5). The Package Leaflet and Labelling were proposed to be updated in 
accordance. 
Assessment report

In addition the Patient Alert Card approved currently was reviewed in a parallel procedure (MEA) by 
the CHMP and an amended more concise text is agreed upon, with no changes to the scientific content. 
In particular simplification and removal of redundancies with the Package leaflet have been 
implemented. The revised text is now implemented as part of this procedure and introduced in the 
labelling as annex III. This is for consistency and harmonisation with the other NOACs approved as 
CAPs (pradaxa, Xarelto) aiming at a better compliance and tracking of the Patient Alert Card.  
User test 
A Readability User Focus User test has been performed with the Eliquis 2,5 mg film-coated tablets PIL 
as during the lifecycle of the product, several changes have been approved and revisions were also 
introduced into the SmPC and the PIL correspondingly, including the extension of the indication. To 
comply with the European Commission Directive 2001/83 EC, modified 2004/27/EC (Articles 59 (3) 
and 61(1), the revised PIL was subjected to a Readability User Focus Test with 10 participants to 
evaluate the impact of the implemented changes on the readability of the new leaflet. This is sufficient 
as the original PIL for Eliquis 2.5 mg film-coated tablets already successfully passed a Readability User 
Test in 2010. 
All 10 participants within the focus test found and understood the information to each question. From 
the results of focus test, it can be concluded that the user should be able to find and understand the 
necessary information in the revised PIL. 
The bridging with Eliquis 5.0 mg film-coated tablets PIL is justified and acceptable.  
2.8.   Variation B.II.e.5  Addition of a new pack size of 28 film coated 
tablets for Eliquis 5mg strength 
The scope of this Type IAIN variation, which has been submitted in the grouped variation 
EMEA/H/C/002148/II/0014/G, is to add a pack size of 28 film-coated tablets for Eliquis 5 mg film-
coated tablets, in the range of the currently approved pack sizes, corresponding to 7 days of treatment 
of 10 mg twice daily (i.e. 4 tablets per day for 7 days). Proposed mock-ups have been included in 
Module 1.3.2 of the dossier. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
The primary packaging material and the cavity design remain unchanged therefore no changes to the 
quality of tablets is expected during stability testing and the shelf life testing parameters and 
specifications will be unaffected by this variation. 
Justification for grouping: 
The recommended dose of Eliquis for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg taken 
orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. 
The currently approved pack-sizes for Eliquis 5 mg film-coated tablet are 14, 20, 56, 60, 168 and 200 
film-coated tablets and perforated unit dose blisters of 100x1 film-coated tablets. 
A pack size of 28 film-coated tablets for Eliquis 5 mg is associated with the new DVT/PE Treatment 
indication and will be implemented after approval of this variation application. 
CHMP comments  
The blister strip of 14 film-coated tablets remain unchanged. Stability will not be affected by the 
proposed new pack size as there is no change in the primary packaging material. Furthermore, the 
proposed new pack size is within the currently approved range of pack sizes. The proposed pack size 
is approvable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Eliquis (apixaban) a factor Xa inhibitor is one of the novel oral anti-coagulants is currently registered 
for prevention of VTE after orthopedic surgery (2.5 mg BID) and prevention of stroke in Atrial 
Fibrillation (5 mg BID). The current application concerns a type 2 variation for extension of the 
indication to include treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (10 mg 
taken orally twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily) and prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE in adults (2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months). 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Efficacy and safety for the proposed indication have been investigated in two pivotal Phase 3 studies 
(CV185056, AMPLIFY and CV185057, AMPLIFY EXT) and one supportive Phase 2 study (CV185017). 
CV185056 was a randomized, active controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, triple-dummy study in 
5395 subjects with acute symptomatic proximal DVT or acute symptomatic PE. This was a non-
inferiority trial, comparing the proposed treatment to enoxaparin / warfarin, which represents the 
current standard of care, in a 1:1 randomisation. The primary endpoint was a composite of VTE / VTE-
related death and was in line with Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for 
the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolic Disease (CPMP/EWP/563/98). The non-inferiority margin 
was set at a relative risk of the primary endpoint of 1.8, which ensures that at least 50% of the 
efficacy of the comparator is maintained. This margin was adequate. 
Apixaban given at 10 mg BID for 7 days followed by 5 mg BID for 6 months demonstrated non-
inferiority to enoxaparin/warfarin. Event rates were 2.26% (59/2609 and 2.69% (71/2635), 
respectively. The relative risk of VTE/VTE-related death for the apixaban-treated subjects was 0.84 
(95% CI: 0.5965, 1.1802; p for non-inferiority: <0.0001) compared to subjects treated with 
enoxaparin/warfarin, with an absolute risk difference of -0.44%. Statistical superiority was not 
achieved. 
The robustness of the results is supported by the per protocol analysis, sensitivity analyses addressing 
missing data, subgroup analyses and the secondary endpoints (including more measures of mortality). 
The efficacy was maintained across all quartiles by Time in Therapeutic Range TTR. 
CV185057 was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 2483 subjects 
with symptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. After completing approximately 6 to 12 months of 
anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of the index event, eligible subjects were randomized to 
receive either apixaban 2.5 mg, apixaban 5 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 randomisation.  
For the primary efficacy analysis results for the endpoint of VTE/all-cause death were imputed as 
having the event in case of missing data. The event rates in the treatments groups were 0.0381 
events/year (32/840), 0.0418 (34/813), 0.1158 (96/829) for apixaban 2.5 mg BID, 5 mg BID or 
placebo respectively. The corresponding relative risks were 0.33 and 0.36, which were highly 
statistically significant. In the (sensitivity) analysis without imputations the relative risks were even 
0.24 and 0.19, based on event rates of 0.0226 (19 events), 0.0172 (14 events) and 0.0929 (77 
events). Results with no imputation gave the same p-value as the analysis with imputation. 
The secondary endpoint analyses confirm efficacy in all predefined outcomes. The relative risks for all 
secondary endpoints for both apixaban doses are < 1 compared to placebo, which are consistent with 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 97/104 
 
 
 
 
 
and support the results of the primary endpoint. The results are further supported by the subgroup 
analyses and other sensitivity analyses. 
The trials were conducted according to current standards. Randomisation and blinding were managed 
through an IVRS system. There was only a small number of dispensing errors (37 errors out of 54,720 
kits assigned by IVRS; 0.07%). The IVRS also managed providing sham INRs for blinding VKA 
treatment in CV185056. Endpoint events were systematically, independently and blinded adjudicated. 
Follow-up was about 97%. 
The included populations in both trials were representative of the intended target population. The 
assumptions in the sample size calculations were sufficiently accurate. 
The sponsor’s internal GCP audits uncovered cases of possible misconduct, requiring closing of two trial 
sites. This supports the effectiveness of the internal audits  and provides reassurance about the 
implemented quality system. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The exact doses for the phase 3 studies were not tested in the dose-finding trial CV185017. Based on 
comparison to approved treatment regimens with other products (e.g. LMWH) and the approved 
regimen for apixaban in atrial fibrillation, the Applicant chose a BID regimen with a higher dose during 
the first week of treatment for further development. This initial dose of 10 mg BID is the highest 
investigated in the apixaban clinical program and has not been approved for any other indication yet.  
The proposed dose for treatment of VTE including prevention of recurrence is 10 mg BID for 7 days 
followed by 5 mg BID for 6 months after the index event; if after that continued prophylaxis is 
required, a lower dose of 2.5 mg BID is equally effective. Thus, it might be questioned if the dose 
could have been reduced earlier than 6 months from 5 mg BID to 2.5 mg BID. However, based on the 
small difference in safety profile of both dose levels and the large effort it would require to investigate 
this in a clinical trial, the currently proposed posology is not further questioned. 
For extended VTE prophylaxis, the dose is again primarily based on extrapolation of data from other 
products and other indications. It was decided to bring both doses to phase 3, which both proved 
effective with (small) differences mainly in safety. 
Although most subgroup analyses in CV185056 are consistent with the main analysis, two analyses 
deserve some extra attention. In an analysis according to extent of VTE, the numerical advantage of 
apixaban in event rate is evident in subjects with extensive disease, but not in all subjects with limited 
or moderate disease. There is no obvious mechanism, by which a therapy for more severe disease 
would not be effective in limited disease. Surprisingly, the relative efficacy was worse in the low BMI 
group, although one would expect the highest concentrations of apixaban in this group while the VKA 
dose would be weight-corrected through INR titration. Both these subgroup findings may be 
attributable to chance. 
The definition of the target population for prevention of VTE recurrence depends on equipoise between 
the risk of VTE and the risk of bleeding by anti-coagulation treatment. This assessment of equipoise 
remains subjective.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Data for the phase 2 and two pivotal phase 3 trials in this application were not pooled, because of 
important differences in design of the two trials (duration and comparator). 
Exposure for 24 to <26 weeks in CV185056 was 1630 patients for apixaban and 1572 patients for 
active comparator. The median exposure in CV185057 was 360 days in both treatment groups, 
resulting in more than 400 patients in each group exposed for at least one year. These exposures are 
sufficient to characterise the safety profile in the sought indications. 
In study CV185056 major bleedings were defined as second in the statistical testing hierarchy. 
Statistical superiority was shown for major bleedings compared to active control (LMWH/VKA) ( 
15/2676 for apixaban and 49/2689 for enoxaparin/warfarin; the risk difference [95% CI] was -0.0113 
[-0.0170, -0.0056], p-value for superiority <0.0001). Other grades of bleeding were not included in 
the statistical testing hierarchy, but still nominally superior to comparators, e.g. clinically relevant non-
major bleedings (CRNMB) were 103/2676 for apixaban and 215/2689 for enoxaparin/warfarin; the risk 
difference [95% CI] was -0.0382 [-0.0506, -0.0259]. 
The advantage in bleedings was consistent when analysed according to quartiles or Time in 
Therapeutic Range for INR. 
In study CV185057, bleedings with either dose of apixaban were more frequent than with placebo. The 
differences were small for MB/CRNMB (Apixaban 2.5 : 27/840; Apixaban 5: 35/811; Placebo: 22/826) 
the risk differences (95% CI) were 0.0048 (-0.0113, 0.0210) and 0.0158 (-0.0018, 0.0335) 
respectively.  
Certain key safety events were prospectively identified as being of special clinical interest based on 
prior experience with apixaban in the clinical program and the experience of drugs in the same 
therapeutic class.  
Myocardial infarction occurred with apixaban in 6 cases and with enoxaparin/warfarin in 4 cases in 
CV185056, but incidence was very low; in CV185057 the numbers were 2 (apixaban 2.5 mg), 3 
(apixaban 5 mg) and 4 (placebo) respectively. 
SAEs related to liver function tests elevations with onset during the treatment period were reported 
for 13 (0.3%) subjects in the apixaban group and 17 (0.5%) subjects in the comparator group. There 
were few outliers (peak ALT > 3xULN, peak Bili > ULN), in both the apixaban and comparator 
treatment groups (4 subjects in each group). Two SAEs in Study CV185057 with onset during the 
treatment period (both drug-induced liver injury) were assessed as possibly related to apixaban 
treatment by the panel of independent hepatologists.  
Review of the pooled database of neurologic events across all apixaban studies, identified a very low 
incidence of neurologic AEs of special interest: Guillain Barre Syndrome (apixaban 3, comparator 3), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (apixaban 2, comparator 1) and other acute polyneuropathies (apixaban 
2, comparator 6) were not more frequent with apixaban. One case of possible GBS occurred in the VTE 
studies. 
Routine monitoring for adverse events confirmed the established safety profile for apixaban, which is 
already based on a large safety database including >60,000 subjects. AEs that were reported by >5% 
of participants in CV185056 included epistaxis (apixaban 2.9%; enoxaparin/warfarin 5.4%) and 
headache (apixaban 6.3%; enoxaparin/warfarin 6.2%). In CV185057 (with percentages for apixaban

2.5, apixaban 5 and placebo respectively): Deep vein thrombosis (1.8, 2.1, 7.4), Pain in extremity 
(5.1, 6.4, 6.5), Back pain (3.2, 5.5, 2.9) and Headache (5.2, 5.2, 5.1).  
Discontinuations due to AEs were more in the comparator groups than with apixaban. An analysis by 
event type revealed no specific pattern. 
Post marketing experience confirms what is already known about apixaban’s safety profile. 
Safety and efficacy through Day 9 in CV185056, which is the period of the higher (10 mg BID) dose for 
VTE treatment, was separately analysed. The results for apixaban were similar to those for 
enoxaparin/warfarin with only a low number of events. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Switching anti-coagulant treatment from VKA to apixaban may occur frequently in clinical practice. No 
specific trends were observed in the three major groups participating in study CV185057 (switchers 
from SOC vs switchers from enox/VKA and patients already on apixaban from study CV185056), 
except from a lower bleeding in switchers from enox/VKA. However, it can be agreed that the groups 
are of limited numbers, complicating interpretation of the results.  
The applicant presented data regarding exposure in elderly patients showing adequate representation 
of patients from 65 to 75 years, but quite limited for patients above 85 years. In both studies, the rate 
of AEs increases with age in both the apixaban and the comparator group, which is expected. In 
general the data does not point to any consistent problems in the older age groups administered 
apixaban. However, there is a trend for more fatal and serious events recorded in the apixaban group 
in the 75-84 years group. On the other hand, in the oldest group, there are 9 fatal cases recorded with 
enoxaparin/warfarin and none in the apixaban, and also the serious events were more frequently 
recorded in the former group. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the indication for VTE treatment, efficacy was statistically non-inferior but numerically superior to 
the current standard of care. Moreover, bleeding events were statistically robustly included in the 
efficacy analysis and proved superior to the standard of care. The standard of care was adequately 
implemented as shown by maintaining the INR within the target therapeutic range (INR of 2.0-3.0) 
60.9% (mean) of the time, which is consistent with recent VTE clinical trials that report a time in 
therapeutic range (TTR) of 58% [EINSTEIN], 60% [RECOVER], and 62.7% [EINSTEIN PE]. The studies 
were well conducted and the robustness of the results further confirmed by sensitivity analyses.  
For the prevention of  VTE recurrence indication, efficacy was  superior to placebo with a limited cost, 
in terms of bleeding events. The choice of the 2.5 mg BID further optimises the B/R balance. The 
importance of the benefits is dependent on the characterisation of the targeted patients, i.e. the risk of 
VTE recurrence. In trial CV185057 the risk of recurrence (as observed in the placebo group) was 9.3%. 
Clinical guidelines are expected to further define the patients that will benefit from this continued 
prophylaxis. 
The additional safety data from the current program confirm the established safety profile of apixaban. 
Long term experience has been obtained for the SPAF indication using the 5 mg BID dose which so far 
is reassuring. The 10 mg BID dose currently recommended in the treatment of VTE is the highest used 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 100/104 
 
 
 
 
 
so far, but that is only for the first week of therapy and no special safety signals were identified during 
this period. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The Benefit risk balance for the requested indication both in terms of treatment and prevention is 
positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
DVT and PE are currently considered manifestations of the same disease. It is estimated that about 
half of the subjects presenting with DVT also have asymptomatic PE; in subjects with PE, DVT 
(whether in the legs or a different anatomical location) must be the cause. For treatment of VTE, both 
with or without symptomatic PE, the current standard of care includes treatment with low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin) for at least 5 days and combined with vitamin K antagonists 
(VKA, e.g. warfarin) for 6 months. The proposed treatment for PE and DVT with apixaban follows the 
same lines. Efficacy is comparable, with a better safety profile for the general cohort.  
The population studied was representative of the population requiring treatment for VTE for 6 months. 
However, the low-risk patients with a provoked VTE without additional risk factors were excluded 
from CV185056 because they would only need 3 months of treatment. The Kaplan Meijer curves for 
VTE events are clearly separated at 3 months already, favouring apixaban. The pathophysiology of a 
clot is expected to be quite comparable between subjects who need 3 or 6 months of therapy. Based 
on this reasoning, the company-proposed extrapolation of efficacy findings from the high risk to the 
low risk patient groups can be accepted, although this was not a priori evident. This reasoning is 
supported, especially in light of the favourable benefit/risk ratio. 
Dose in special populations.  
Based on the Pharmacokinetic data presented in the population PK study, comparable dose 
recommendations would have been expected for the SPAF and the VTE treatment indications. 
Considering that dose adaptations are required in certain patient groups in the SPAF indication, e.g. 
patients with exclusive severe renal impairment, or patients with at least two of the following risks: 
age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dlL (133 micromole/lL), applying no 
dose adjustments for these same groups in the current program was extensively discussed by the 
CHMP. The difference in the goal during the management of SPAF from that in VTEt necessitates 
different dose recommendations, i.e prophylaxis vs acute treatment.  
A dose of 10 mg BID is used in the first week of VTEt to ensure maximal efficacy for dissolving the clot 
and prevention of extension. In this population, available exposure data in patients with severe renal 
impairment (n=29) in relation to efficacy and safety are not helpful due to the small number of 
bleeding events (MB = 1) but shows a higher risk of major bleeding of 1.18 (95% CI 0.13, 10.98) for 
apixaban vs. enoxaparin/warfarin.  Pooled data of moderate and severe renal impairment patients 
were submitted to allow interpretation of the results. For the whole treatment period, efficacy and 
safety results are in line with those of patients with mild renal impairment, in which no dose 
adaptations are recommended.  Specific results for the first 9 days to address safety of the highest 
dose include very limited events precluding any robust conclusions. However, a higher bleeding 
tendency cannot be excluded.  However, in conclusion, it can be agreed that the B/R of non-
investigated dose reductions is not known and accordingly cannot be advised. Comparable data were 
presented for patients with a combination of risk factors (age, weight or renal impairment) who 
constituted around 100 patients in AMPLIFY. The presented data did not indicate any increased risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/478338/2014  
Page 101/104 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to the general cohort. Thus it was considered acceptable that the current dose 
recommendations are the only one investigated in study AMPLIFY. Available data are reassuring but 
cannot robustly exclude a bleeding risk due to the limited patients numbers. Theoretical dose 
adaptations cannot be advised either. In conclusion, recommendations for posology were agreed 
together with information  clearly reflecting the limited clinical trial data and the associated risks.  
Apixaban is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore the concomitant use of systemic 
treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp is not recommended. Concomitant use of 
concomitant strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp may potentially result in decreased efficacy and 
it is likely to have greater clinical significance in the treatment of VTE population than for the VTEp and 
NVAF indications. Therefore, apixaban is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients 
receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy 
may be compromised, and should be used with caution for the prevention indications.  
The indication for continued prophylaxis is not clearly defined and remains subjective. This subjectivity 
was already recognised during the assessment of the rivaroxaban application for the same indication. 
It is left to the physician's assessment to identify patients in whom the B/R would be positive for such 
an extended use after careful assessment of the treatment benefit against the bleeding risk.  
However, the B/R in some patient groups is not considered optimal due to a higher bleeding risk, e.g , 
subjects ≥ 75 years; subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment and subjects with BMI ≤ 
28 kg/m2. Presented data cannot robustly conclude on a positive or negative B/R of apixaban in these 
sub populations. This is due to their limited representation and also the few events recorded for 
efficacy and safety. Importantly, a higher bleeding risk cannot be excluded. For each of these groups 
(>75 years, <60 kg and severe renal impairment) clear and specific warnings regarding the limited 
clinical data and that apixaban should be used with caution due to the higher bleeding risk are 
introduced in the SmPC to clearly inform the prescribers about the associated risks.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Extavia has the same composition and the same pharmaceutical form as Betaferon, 250 microgram/ml, 
powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection,  which  has  been  marketed  by  Bayer  Schering  Pharma 
AG  since  1995  (Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  number  EU/1/95/003/003-006  in  November  1995).  
The last renewal date of Betaferon was 31 January 2006.  A variation procedure EMEA/H/C/81/II/48, 
which started in June 2007, relates to the inclusion of results from a 3-year integrated analysis and first 
year  of  follow-up  of  an  ongoing  clinical  study  in  patients  with  a  single  clinical  event  suggestive  of 
multiple sclerosis.  A positive opinion was issued on 15 November 2007; changes to the SPC resulting 
from this variation have been reflected in the SPC of Extavia in order to harmonise the SPCs of both 
products. 
On  13  September  2007,  Bayer  Schering  Pharma  AG  has  acquired  from  Novartis  Vaccines  and 
Diagnostics  Inc.  the  biologics  manufacturing  facility  used  to  produce  Betaferon  and  agreed  to 
manufacture Extavia for Novartis. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent application of the Betaferon application, the quality data 
in support of Extavia application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the  Betaferon dossier 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
Like Betaferon, Extavia is supplied as a vial with powder and either a 1.2 ml pre-filled syringe with 
1.2 ml solvent or a 2.25 ml pre-filled syringe with 1.2 ml solvent and a vial adapter with needle. 
Human albumin 12.5 mg is used as an excipient.  
2.3  Non clinical aspects 
In  accordance  with  Directive  2001/83/EC  and  Guideline  CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  it  has  been  accepted 
that there was no need to provide an environmental risk assessment, since the active interferon beta-1b 
is  a  recombinant  equivalent  of  the  antiviral  human  native  cytokine  interferon  beta,  a  naturally 
occurring  protein.    Moreover,  with  a  maximum  daily  dose  of  250µg,  the  predicted  environmental 
concentration  in  surface  water  (PECsw)  is  expected  to  be  significantly  below  the  trigger  value  of 
10ng/L for a phase II environmental fate and effect analysis. 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Not applicable. 
2.5  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
Pharmacovigilance System 
The  Pharmacovigilance  System  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the  requirements  and  provides 
adequate  evidence  that  the  Applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person  responsible  for 
Pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  collection  and  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring in the Community or in a third country.  Furthermore, the Applicant 
has satisfactorily addressed the issues raised by the CHMP in December 2007. 
Risk Management Plan

In support of the application, a Risk Management Plan- which included a risk minimisation plan- was 
produced  and  submitted  by  Bayer  Schering  Pharma  AG  on  behalf  of  Novartis,  the  Applicant.    The 
Applicant satisfactorily addressed the issues raised by the CHMP in December 2007 and provided a 
letter of undertaking with a commitment to the activities outlined in the RMP.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  PSUR  cycle  for  Extavia  will  correspond  to  the  one  of  Betaferon  unless 
otherwise specified. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Based on the review of the data from Module 1, and the submitted Risk Management Plan, the CHMP 
considers that the application for Extavia (interferon beta-1b) is approvable. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
Concerning safety and efficacy, as this was an informed consent application, no data were submitted 
and the risk/benefit balance is the same as for Betaferon. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:

routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Extavia in the treatment of patients 
• 
with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe enough to 
warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, 
and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis. 
with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two years. 
with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by relapses. 
• 
• 
 was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic fibrosis is a chronically debilitating, autosomal recessive disease associated with serious 
morbidity and a high rate of premature mortality and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is 
caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that result in 
absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial 
chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 7/73 
 
 
 
 
 
failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem pathology associated 
with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein result in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
Orkambi is currently indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and 
older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
This line extension application is for an age adapted dosage strength and includes an extension of 
indication to children 1 year and older, from the currently approved target population 2 years and 
older. The same genotypic subpopulation of cystic fibrosis (homozygous for the F508del mutation in 
the CFTR gene) is indicated. The line extension proposes an additional dosage strength of oral granules 
for children 1 to<2 years: LUM 75-mg/IVA 94-mg granules in sachet. 
Orkambi is authorised in the EU as two fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet strengths: LUM 200-
mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet and LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet and two FDC granules strengths 
in sachet: LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg and LUM 150 mg/IVA 188 mg. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide, including approximately 30,000 individuals in 
the United States (US), 32,000 individuals in the European Union (EU), 4,000 individuals in Canada, 
and 3,100 individuals in Australia. The incidence and prevalence of CF varies between racial groups; CF 
is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North America and Europe than in Asian 
and African populations. 
The median predicted age of survival for patients with CF born in 2014 is 40.0 years of age. Although 
expected survival has doubled over the past 30 years due to advances in treatment, of those who died 
in 2014, the median age at death ranged from 27.0 to 32.4 years in the US, Canada, EU, and 
Australia. 
Since the introduction and continued advances of newborn and antenatal screening, many patients 
with CF are identified through a positive screening test and subsequently diagnosed within the first 
year of life. Approximately 60% of patients with CF in the EU and 83% of patients with CF in the UK 
are diagnosed by 1 year of age. In the US, more than 80% of patients with CF are diagnosed by 2 
years of age. CF clearly affects the paediatric population, as approximately half of the total CF patient 
population in the US, EU, Australia, and Canada are less than 18 years of age. 
Orkambi is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of CF patients 2 years and older who are 
homozygous for the mutation F508del, the commonest disease-causing CFTR mutation. In the EU, 
approximately 80% of patients with CF have F508del on at least one allele and 40% are homozygous 
for F508del. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) gene that result in 
absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial 
chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, 
intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water 
absorption and secretion. CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they 
disrupt CFTR function. Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR, class 
II mutations consist of aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 8/73 
 
 
 
 
system, while class III mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, 
the absence of CFTR function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with 
pancreatic insufficiency. CFTR mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped 
together in class IV. Class V mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the 
amount of otherwise normal CFTR. These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder 
expression of the disease. The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene 
resulting in a loss of phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR) and it is a Class 
II mutation: it prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-
no chloride transport. 
Patients who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and 
hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease. The failure of the mutated CFTR to function properly in 
the lungs result in a cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation that leads to irreversible 
structural changes in the lungs and eventually respiratory failure, the most common cause of death for 
patients with CF. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of 
lung, pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into 
adulthood. The indication is restricted to the homozygous F508del-CFTR genotypic subpopulation of CF 
who have a severe form of the disease due to the very low level of chloride channel function. Even in 
this severely affected subgroup, however, lung injury proceeds at a slow rate and pulmonary function 
as measured by spirometry can be apparently normal in the younger age group. Nonetheless, even 
with normal spirometry, patients can have pulmonary structural aberrations on computed tomography 
(CT) scans. Consistent with this, impaired lung clearance index (LCI), which measures the degree of 
small airway disease by assessing ventilation inhomogeneity, can be demonstrated in paediatric 
patients with normal spirometry. Because the underlying molecular defect is the same in this age 
group and older patients, it was anticipated that LUM/IVA may be efficacious in this population to slow 
or pre-empt disease progression by correcting the biochemical defect in the chloride channel protein. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current CF treatments include CFTR modulators and enzyme supplements, mucolytics, antibiotics, and 
vitamins. Treatment guidelines recommend CFTR modulator and non-modulator medications 
concomitantly administered to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and 
exacerbations, and improve quality of life. CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that affect the production of the CFTR protein. Drugs that target 
the underlying defect in the CFTR protein, CFTR modulators, target specific defects caused by 
mutations in the CFTR gene and thus treat the underlying cause of the disease. The main goal of 
therapy is to maintain and restore respiratory function. There are two main types of modulators, 
potentiators and correctors. Potentiators recover the function of the CFTR protein at the apical surface 
of epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic mutations, while correctors improve 
intracellular processing of the CFTR protein, increasing surface expression, in class II mutations. A 
third type is production correctors or read-through agents, which promote transcription of CFTR in 
class I mutations. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi 
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) and Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ELX/TEZ/IVA) are the 
CFTR modulators approved for specific age groups of CF patients with specific mutations. Ivacaftor (in 
Kalydeco as mono-component and in Orkambi, Symkevi and Kaftrio as part of fixed dose 
combinations) is a potentiator, the active substance lumacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are 
correctors (present in the fixed dose combinations).

2.2.  About the product 
Orkambi is a fixed drug combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor that combines corrector and 
potentiator action to provide a partial reversal of the biochemical defect in the chloride channel due to 
mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) through increased 
gating activity, resulting in increased chloride transport. F508del-CFTR is a Class II mutation leading to 
an aberrantly folded protein susceptible to defective intracellular processing and trafficking that 
prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride 
transport. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has 
defective channel gating and decreased stability at the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous for 
F508del-CFTR have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of 
CF disease. 
Lumacaftor is presumed to partially correct the folding defect in F508del-CFTR, facilitating its cellular 
processing and trafficking, allowing the protein to reach the cell surface. The channel gating activity of 
F508del-CFTR delivered to the cell surface by lumacaftor can be potentiated by ivacaftor to further 
enhance chloride transport. 
When added in vitro to F508del/F508del human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE), the magnitude of 
chloride transport observed with the combination of lumacaftor and either acute or chronic ivacaftor 
treatment was greater than that observed with lumacaftor alone. 
The claimed indication is: 
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 1 year and 
older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 
For the proposed use in paediatric patients aged 1 to less than 2 years, the age- and weight-adapted 
dosing is proposed as follows:

The finished product is presented as granules in sachet for oral administration containing 75 mg of 
lumacaftor and 94 mg of ivacaftor. 
The composition of the new lower dosage strength (75 mg/94 mg) and the authorised granules 
strengths is the same in terms of both active substances (lumacaftor and ivacaftor) and excipients 
content. In fact, the same bulk granules are packed in sachets at a different granule fill mass to 
manufacture the three granule strengths. As in the authorised presentations, lumacaftor active 
substance is provided as a crystalline solid while ivacaftor active substance as an amorphous spray-
dried dispersion (SDD) intermediate.  
The new dosage strength is determined by the fill weight of the fixed-ratio granules that are heat-
sealed in foil laminate sachets. For the administration, the granules are emptied from the sachets and 
mixed with a small amount of soft food for oral administration (details regarding the administration are 
reported in the SmPC). 
The two active substances, lumacaftor and ivacaftor, have a very low solubility in water (< 1µg/mL) 
and the insufficient physical stability of amorphous ivacaftor in aqueous media, do not allow neither a 
solution nor a suspension formulation of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC. Consequently, a granule dosage 
form for oral administration was developed for ease of administration to paediatric patients. The 
granules are emptied from the sachet and mixed with a small amount of soft food or liquid.  
All excipients are already used in existing Orkambi presentations. They are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in 
the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. No 
compatibility studies for lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules have been conducted for this line extension 
application.

In order to evaluate the sensory attributes of the oral granules, the MAH conducted a sensory study 
(Study 013) with adult trained panellists. The study was conducted with lumacaftor active substance, 
ivacaftor Spray Dried Dispersion (SDD) and 75 mg/125 mg  lumacaftor/ivacaftor granules with 
excipients. This was described in the line extension EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G which introduced the 
100/125 mg or 150/188 mg granules. Briefly, the results of the study indicated that the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules show a moderate intensity bitterness profile due overall to the 
ivacaftor SDD. After mixing of lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules with small amounts (about 5mL) of 
soft foods (carrot puree, plain non-fat yogurt and applesauce) for oral administration, there was a 
significant reduction of the bitterness and an improvement of the overall sensory profile of the finished 
product. The water showed only a slight reduction of the bad taste. Based on the obtained results of 
the taste study, the conclusion was that the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules dosed with soft foods 
have an acceptable palatability (see further information under the stability section). After that, the 
acceptability of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules was confirmed in two pivotal Phase 3 studies: 
Study 115 where were tested lumacaftor/ivacaftor (100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 mg) FDC 
granules and Study 122 for lumacaftor 75 mg/ivacaftor 94 mg. 
The pharmaceutical development of lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules contains QbD elements. The 
quality target product profile (QTPP) of granules is shown in  
Table 1. 
Table 1 Quality Target Product Profile 
Potential critical quality attributes (CQAs) for the lumacaftor active substance, ivacaftor SDD and the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules were described.  
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The 
critical process parameters have been adequately identified.  
The lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules CQAs and their impact on quality, safety, and/or efficacy are 
provided in Table 2.

Table 2 Critical Quality Attributes 
Dissolution is a critical quality attribute (CQA) of lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC immediate release granules. 
In Phase 3 clinical study, three different doses strengths of FDC granules (lumacaftor/ivacaftor 75 
mg/94 mg, 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 m), were tested. Two independent in-vitro dissolution 
methods were developed for testing the lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets. Taking into account that the 
paediatric FDC granules have the same composition as the intragranular ingredients of the paediatric 
FDC tablets, the applicability of the FDC paediatric tablet dissolution methods were evaluated for use in 
the FDC granules. This was assessed as part of EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G which concluded that 
both dissolution methods have shown discriminating ability against meaningful manufacturing 
variations and are considered suitable for their intended use as the primary release and stability 
quality control methods for lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules, including the 75 mg/94 mg strength. In 
addition, with available in vivo data, the clinical relevance of both dissolution methods was established. 
The primary packaging is in a foil laminate [biaxially-oriented polyethylene 
terephthalate/polyethylene/foil/polyethylene (BOPET/PE/Foil/PE)] sachet. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
With this line extension submission, the MAH is adding a new bulk granule manufacturing site and a 
new primary packaging/sachet filling site for the new 75 mg of lumacaftor and 94 mg of ivacaftor 
granule strength. To add these sites for the already authorised granule strengths the MAH should 
submit the relevant variation application.  
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor bulk granules are manufactured using a continuous manufacturing process and 
utilize the same operations used for the authorised lumacaftor/ivacaftor paediatric tablet and granules 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023

strengths. In fact, the same fixed-ratio granules formulation is used for all FDC granule strength 
formulation (lumacaftor/ivacaftor 75 mg/94 mg, 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/180mg); each product is 
filled at a different target granule fill mass. 
The Quality Target Product profile (QTPP) and the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) are the same for 
the three strengths. The MAH states that the bulk granule content (% w/w) composition, 
manufacturing and packaging process and equipment used at the manufacturing sites are the same for 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (75 mg/94 mg, 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 mg) FDC granules finished 
product.(to note as indicated above, the MAH should submit a variation to register the new 
manufacturing site for the 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/180 mg strengths).The manufacturing process 
for Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor FDC Granules includes sieving of ivacaftor SDD and lumacaftor active 
substance with intragranular excipients, blending, granulation, drying, milling and sachet packaging. 
As described in the CHMP AR for the existing granule strengths, Vertex used Quality by Design (QbD) 
in product and process development of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules.  
In this line extension application the MAH wishes to a manufacturing site for bulk granules. he 
proposed granule manufacturing process at this new siteand its development has been acceptably 
described and the. design spaces developed justified  
The MAH states that after manufacturing, the excess bulk lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules 
manufactured are packed in a container The storage time and conditions have been supported by bulk 
granules stability studies from two batches However, even if the bulk granules packaging seems to be 
more moisture protective than the sachet packaging, the sachet stability data provided by the MAH can 
be considered as bulk granules supportive stability data only and does not substitute the requirement 
to provide the bulk stability data in compliance with EMA/Quality of Medicines Q&A: Part 2. 
Consequently, the MAH is required to commit to provide bulk granules stability data (minimum of two 
batches) from commercial scale batches for each bulk granules manufacturing site, in compliance with 
EMA/Quality of Medicines Q&A, Part 2 – section 5, post-approval (REC1). 
Process validation is complete at the existing and the newly proposed manufacturing site For sachet 
filling/primary packaging process validation is complete at one of the sites butis still on-going at 
another and no 75 mg/94 mg granules will be placed on the market from that second site until process 
validation is complete. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications are the same as for the already authorised 
FDC lumacaftor/ivacaftor bulk granule dosage strengths (105 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 mg) and 
include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules was assessed 
as part of EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G according to the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities 
using a risk based approach. The risk assessment considered the potential inputs from both lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor active substances and ivacaftor SDD (including solvents, reagents, excipients, and 
equipment), water, excipients, manufacturing equipment and container closure systems to determine 
the overall content of elemental impurities in the lumacaftor / ivacaftor FDC granules. This risk 
assessment and confirmatory testing demonstrates that the risk of elemental impurities in the 
lumacaftor / ivacaftor granules is low and the product will consistently meet the ICH Q3D 
requirements. Therefore, no additional controls on elemental impurities are required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 14/73 
 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used were adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines as part of EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
A risk assessment was performed to verify the potential presence of nitrosamines in 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules, in compliance with EMA/369136/2020 (procedure number: 
EMEA/H/A-5(3)/1490). The MAH has provided a risk evaluation about the presence of nitrosamine(s) 
impurities in both active substances (lumacaftor and ivacaftor), finished product intermediate, finished 
product, and sachet packaging processes. Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the granules. Therefore, no specific control measures are 
deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used are the same used for the authorised 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 
mg granules. They have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for eight commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
As indicated above, the three dosage strengths of lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules are packaged from 
bulk granules of the same composition and have the same packaging configuration. Consequently, the 
information obtained from the 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 mg FDC granules dosage strengths can 
be applied to the 75 mg/94 mg strength. The proposed shelf-life of 36 months without any special 
storage condition is supported by the following available data: 
-  48 months under long-term conditions (25°C/60% RH ± 5% RH) and 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH ± 5% RH) stability data from 3 primary stability batches of 
100 mg/125 mg FDC granules and 3 primary stability batches of 150 mg/188 mg FDC granules 
stored in the commercial container closure system (foil laminated sachet); 
-  24 months under long-term and 6 months under accelerated conditions from three primary 
stability batches of 75 mg/94 mg dosage strength in the commercial packaging (foil laminated 
sachet); 
-  12 months of long-term and three months of accelerated conditions stability data from a fourth 
additional primary stability batch of 75 mg/94 mg dosage strength in the commercial 
configuration (foil laminated sachet) and manufactured using the tighter in-process controls for 
the sachet filling (see details below).  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and 
physical form. Microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC and E. coli) and water activity were tested on batches 
stored at 30 ºC / 75% RH. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules in its commercial packaging (foil laminate sachet) was shown to be 
stable under the tested storage conditions. The six primary stability batches of 100 mg/125 mg and 
150 mg/188 mg FDC granules met the commercial specifications at all time points through 48 months 
at both long-term (25°/60% RH) and accelerated (40°C/75% RH) storage conditions. The obtained 
stability data from the primary stability batches of the new 75 mg/94 mg FDC granules met the 
commercial established specifications at all times, except for one of the batches which showed an out 
of specification for lumacaftor assay limit below 95.0-105.0% at long term condition. The MAH 
indicated that this was due to a lower sachet fill weight for this specific batch and not related to a 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023

change during stability. No changes were observed in any of the other attributes tested. As 
consequence the MAH implemented a tighter process controls in the sachet filling process to reduce the 
batch variability and to ensure conformance to the assay specification at release and at shelf-life. . An 
additional 75 mg/94 mg batch was manufactured with this narrower sachet fill weight IPC acceptance 
criteria and placed on stability. All stability data from this batch met the proposed specification. 
Taking into account that the laminate foil container closure system is a light protective packaging, the 
no photostability test as per ICHQ1B guideline, Option 2, was conducted with lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
granules. This is acceptable. 
In-use stability studies to verify the chemical and physical stability of granules mixed with more 
common foods that could be used to administrate the granules were assessed as part of the previous 
line extension introducing the 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 mg FDC granules 
(EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G). The conclusions from that study are also applicable to the 75 mg/94 
mg FDC granules and support the instructions included in the SmPC: ‘” The entire content of each 
sachet of granules should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or liquid 
and the mixture completely consumed. Some examples of soft foods or liquids include puréed fruits or 
vegetables, flavoured yogurt, applesauce, water, milk, breast milk, infant formula or juice. Food or 
liquid should be at room temperature or below. Once mixed, the product has been shown to be stable 
for one hour, and therefore should be ingested during this period”.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without any special storage 
condition as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the 75 mg/94 mg granules has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the 
finished product and its manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in 
the manufacture of the finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. The results 
of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertained to the requirement to provide confirmatory bulk 
granules stability data from a minimum of two commercial scale batches for each bulk granule 
manufacturing site. This point is put forward and agreed as recommendation for future quality 
development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 16/73 
 
 
 
 
The MAH should provide confirmatory bulk granules stability data from a minimum of two commercial 
scale batches for each bulk granule manufacturing site (REC1).  
2.5.   Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in this application. 
2.5.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
With the renewal EMEA/H/003954/R/0056 finalised in November 2020, the complete ERA for both 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor in Orkambi (fixed dose combination, lumacaftor/ivacaftor) was agreed. The 
conclusions were that both ivacaftor (VX-770) and lumacaftor (VX-809) are unlikely to represent a risk 
to the environment.  
The present submission encompasses the extension of the indication for Orkambi granules in sachet for 
children aged 1 to less than 2 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
The MAH highlighted that the ERA report dated 11 September 2019 already included patients 1 to <2 
years of age since the calculations performed for the initial environmental risk assessment accounted 
for the entire population of CF patients (irrespective of age), so no updated ERA in relation to the line 
extension has been provided. This is considered acceptable.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
It is agreed that no updated report is considered necessary since the calculation for the initial ERA already 
included patients 1 to <2 years of age. 
2.5.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
The extended indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to 
the use of Orkambi as it was already part of the environmental risk assessment.  
Considering the above data, Orkambi is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The proposed extension of indication is based on results from Study 122, a Phase 3, 2-part, open-
label, multicentre study in subjects 1 to <2 years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del. Study 122 
was designed to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) in Part A and safety in Part B.  
The extrapolation of benefit to this age group is further supported by pharmacodynamic (PD) data 
from Study 122 Part B. 
Study 122 is a phase 3, 2-part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of 
Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in Subjects 1 to Less Than 2 Years of Age With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous for 
F508del. 
Part A was designed to evaluate the PK and safety of LUM/IVA over 15 days of dosing. The evaluation 
of LUM/IVA as multiple doses allowed for the assessment of the time-dependent induction effect of 
LUM on the metabolism of IVA. The duration of dosing in Part A was selected to evaluate the PK and 
safety endpoints when the induction effect of LUM on the metabolism of IVA was anticipated to have 
reached steady state. 
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety of LUM/IVA dosing over 24 weeks in this paediatric CF 
population. In addition, the PD effects and PK of multiple doses of LUM/IVA over 24 weeks of dosing 
were evaluated, and a 2-week Washout Period was included in order to evaluate the off-drug PD 
response. 
For both Parts A and B, LUM/IVA granules were administered orally every 12 hours (q12h). 
Assessment report

The doses and weight bounds in Study 122 were selected to achieve the target exposures observed 
previously to be safe and efficacious in adult subjects. After completion of Part A Cohort 1 (18 to <24 
months), Part A Cohort 1 PK and safety results were reviewed and the popPK models were updated to 
determine the dosing regimen for Part A Cohort 2 (12 to <18 months of age) and subjects 18 to <24 
months of age in Part B.  
The updated popPK models supported a new lower dose of L75/I94 q12h for subjects weighing 7 to 
<10 kg at screening for Part A Cohort 2. 
After completion of Part A Cohort 2 (12 to <18 months), Part A Cohort 2 PK and safety results and a 
subset of PK and safety data from subjects 18 to <24 months of age through Week 12 in Part B was 
reviewed. The popPK models were updated again to include Part A Cohort 2 data and the available Part 
B data. The updated models supported an adjustment to the weight bound between the L75/I94 and 
L100/I125 q12h dose from 10 kg to 9 kg. 
The PK Set contained data for all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, which included 7 
subjects in Part A Cohort 1, 7 subjects in Part A Cohort 2, and 46 subjects in Part B.  
Results 
Part A  
PK concentrations for LUM and M28-LUM are presented in the table below:  
Table 3 Summary of Plasma concentrations for Lum and M28-LUM, PK Set, Part A 
The mean LUM Ctrough values were comparable between Day 8 and Day 15, which suggests that 
steady state for LUM was achieved by Day 8. The mean LUM C3-4h was comparable on Day 1 and Day 
15, showing minimal accumulation of LUM from Day 1 to Day 15. 
The trend for M28-LUM Ctrough was similar to that of the parent and suggests that steady state for 
M28-LUM was achieved by Day 8. The mean M28-LUM C3-4h increased from 252 ng/mL on Day 1 to 
1420 ng/mL on Day 15 for the L75/I94 q12h group and from 192 ng/mL to 1240 ng/mL on Day 15 for 
the L100/I125 q12h group, which shows an accumulation of M28-LUM from Day 1 to Day 15. 
The mean LUM and M28-LUM concentrations at each timepoint were comparable between the 2 dosing 
groups. 
PK concentrations for IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA are presented in the table below:

Table 4 Summary of Plasma Concentrations for IVA, MI-IVA, and M6-IVA, PK Set, 
Part A 
The mean IVA C3-4h was higher on Day 1 and decreased on Day 15 to 718 ng/mL for the L75/I94 
q12h group and 496 ng/mL for the L100/I125 q12h group. The trend for M1-IVA C3-4h was similar to 
that of the parent. Unlike the parent and M1-IVA results, the mean M6-IVA C3-4h increased from Day 
1 to Day 15, which shows an accumulation of M6-IVA. 
Ctrough of IVA, M1-IVA and M6-IVA were all higher on Day 8 than Day 15. 
Part B  
PK concentrations for LUM and M28-LUM are presented in the table below: 
Table 5 Summary of PK Concentrations for LUM and M28-LUM (PK Set, Part B) 
The mean LUM Ctrough was comparable between the Day 15, Week 4, and Week 12 Visits in the 
L100/I125 q12h and L150/I188 q12h groups. This suggests that steady state for LUM was achieved by 
Day 15. The trend for M28-LUM Ctrough was similar to that of the parent. The LUM Ctrough in the 
L75/I94 q12h group appeared to be more variable across study visits than that observed in the 
Assessment report

L100/I125 q12h group, likely because only 1 subject was dosed in the L75/I94 q12h group in Part B so 
a trend cannot be established. 
For the purpose of cross-study comparisons between this study and the pivotal Phase 3 study in 
subjects aged 2 through 5 years old with CF, Ctrough,ave was calculated to provide composite values 
of approximate trough concentrations.  
PopPK analysis 
An updated popPK analyses of lumacaftor (LUM, also known as VX-809) in combination with ivacaftor 
(IVA, also known as VX-770) was provided in report (R231). R231 popPK analyses were conducted to 
support the dose selection and the overall clinical development for LUM/IVA. The analyses described in 
this report are a continuation of previous analyses for this age group (R230) and were used to support 
the dose selection for LUM/IVA in 12 to <24 months of age in CF subjects. R231 popPK analyses 
documents the final popPK modelling and simulations of LUM and IVA in CF subjects 12 to less than 24 
months of age based on the final data from Study VX16-809-122. According to the MAH, these results 
support the dose selection for Orkambi (LUM/IVA combination therapy) in subjects 12 to <24 months 
of age with cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygous for the F508del mutation. 
Specific objectives of this analysis are: 
• to evaluate the previously developed popPK model (Report R230) of LUM when co-administered with 
IVA in CF subjects aged 12 months through 11 years of age using the final PK dataset from Study 122;  
• to evaluate the previously developed popPK model (Report R230) of IVA when coadministered with 
LUM in CF subjects aged 12 months through 11 years of age using the final PK dataset from Study 122 
and taking into account its increased metabolism due to CYP3A induction by LUM;  
• to simulate the exposures of LUM and IVA with the studied dosing regimen in Part B of Study 122;  
• to summarize the exposures of LUM and IVA in CF subjects aged 12 to less than 24 months in Part B 
of Study 122; and  
• to support the dose selection for CF subjects 12 to less than 24 months of age taking LUM/IVA 
combination therapy. 
Models described in Report R230 were used as a starting point to evaluate the effect of age and weight 
on the exposures of LUM and IVA.

The LUM dataset included a total of 1602 observations for 287 unique subjects with 3 observations 
excluded from the analysis. 
The final LUM dataset used for model development included 1599 LUM plasma concentration 
measurements from 287 CF subjects, including 62 LUM plasma concentration measurements from 14 
unique 12 to <24 months CF subjects in Part A and 259 LUM plasma concentration measurements 
from 46 unique 12 to <24 months CF subjects in Part B. 
PK profiles at steady-state stratified by age and dose groups show that the concentration profiles of 
the newest data added (12 to <24 months) are comparable to the other age groups, noting that there 
is only 1 subject 12 to <24 months administered the LUM 150 mg/IVA 188 mg q12h dosing regimen. 
Baseline weight and baseline age were correlated covariates with a strong correlation between weight 
and age within this paediatric population. 
The LUM final model is a linear, two-compartment popPK model with first-order absorption, zero-order 
infusion duration, absorption lag, inter-individual variability (IIV) on CL/F and Vc/F, proportional error, 
and the following covariate effects: 
•  Estimated allometric exponents (weight effect) on clearances (CL/F and Q/F) and volumes (Vc/F 
and Vp/F); and 
• 
Fixed effect of fast maturation rate on CL/F. 
Shrinkage estimates for the IIV effects were 10% for CL/F and 42% for Vc/F, indicating that ETA-based 
diagnostics were more reliable for CL/F than Vc/F (i.e., shrinkage was less than 30%). 
According to the MAH, the final model provided an adequate description of the LUM concentration data. 
No significant trends were observed on the IIV versus categorical covariates, noting that there were 
only 3 subjects in the <9kg weight group. Graphical presentation of the covariate effects of age and 
weight on the IIV values for CL/F and Vc/F, showed that there were no significant trends observed in

the final model. Distribution of quantiles for random effects indicated that the IIVs were normally 
distributed. Evaluation of the random effect terms in the model showed a significant correlation 
between CL/F and Vc/F, as expected given the nature of the OMEGA matrix. 
The precision of the model parameter estimates was obtained from the successful covariance step in 
NONMEM with the default setting. With exception of KA (relative standard error (RSE)=40%), all PK 
parameters were well estimated (RSE <12%) for the final data set (including subjects 12 months 
through 11 years of age). RSE for KA is inflated due to the fact that its value is close to 1 and was log 
transformed for purposes of estimation (with log(1)=0). The 95% confidence interval for KA was 
reasonably narrow [0.6-0.9], confirming that KA was reasonably estimated. The PK parameters (CL/F, 
Vc/F, Q/F, Vp/F, KA, and D1) are for a 70-kg CF patient receiving LUM in the tablet formulation. 
IVACAFTOR 
The IVA dataset included a total of 1588 observations for 287 unique subjects. 9 observations were 
excluded from the analysis, including 3 BLQ entries and 2 records prior to the first dose. 
The final IVA dataset used for model development included 1579 IVA plasma concentration 
measurements from 287 CF subjects, including 62 IVA plasma concentration measurements from 14 
unique 12 to <24 months CF subjects in Part A and 258 IVA plasma concentration measurements from 
46 unique 12 to <24 months CF subjects in Part B. Overall, the percentage of BLQ observations was 
small: 3 out of 1588 observations, or <0.01%. 
Overall, plots show that the concentration profiles of the newest data added (12 to <24 months) are 
comparable to the other age groups, noting that there is only 1 subject 12 to <24 months 
administered the LUM 150 mg/IVA 188 mg q12h dosing regimen. 
Covariates were identical between LUM and IVA, the matrix-plot showing the distributions and 
correlation of the continuous covariates most relevant to the IVA exposures matched those for LUM. 
The schematic of the final model structure was unchanged from that of Report R230. The IVA final 
model is a linear, two-compartment popPK model with first-order absorption, zero-order infusion 
duration, IIVs on CL/F and Vc/F, proportional error, induction delay, and the following covariate 
effects: estimated allometric exponent (weight effect) on clearances (CL/F and Q/F) and volumes (Vc/F 
and Vp/F); and fixed effect of fast maturation rate on CL/F. 
Shrinkage estimates for the IIV effects were 8% for CL/F and 43% for Vc/F, indicating that ETA-based 
diagnostics were more reliable for CL/F than Vc/F (i.e., shrinkage was less than 30%). 
According to the MAH the final model provided an adequate description of the IVA concentration data.  
No significant trends were observed on the IIV versus categorical covariates, noting that there were 
only 3 subjects in the <9kg weight group. Graphical presentation of the covariate effects of age and 
weight on the IIV values for CL/F and Vc/F showed that there were no significant trends observed in 
the final model. 
Distribution of quantiles for random effects indicated that the IIVs were generally normally distributed. 
Evaluation of the random effect terms in the model showed a significant correlation between CL/F and 
Vc/F, as expected given the nature of the OMEGA matrix. 
The precision of the model parameter estimates was obtained from the successful covariance step in 
NONMEM with the default setting. Except for kenz (84.2%), all fixed-effect PK parameters were well 
estimated (RSE <22%) for the final data set (including subjects 12 months through 11 years of age).  
Median IVA CL/F for this population was 5.54 L/h in the absence of LUM induction, and 25 L/h in the 
presence of LUM.

The visual predictive checks (VPCs) were based on 500 simulated replicates of the model analysis 
dataset. Since 4 different doses were administered in this population, both VPCs and prediction-
corrected VPCs (pcVPCs) were performed. Some deviations were observed in higher weight groups (14 
to <24 kg and ≥24 kg), primarily in the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Also, there was not sufficient 
data in the lightest (<9kg) subgroup to adequately assess model predictions other than the median. 
Overall, the VPCs indicated that the LUM final model captured the observed data at steady state 
reasonably well, especially for the central tendencies and the population of interest (12 to <24 
months). 
Altogether, these model diagnostics demonstrated that the popPK model for LUM was consistent with 
the observed data. 
Figure 2 below shows the steady-state exposures for LUM and IVA AUC’s, derived from EBEs 
simulations for the different age and weight groups.  
The studied dosing regimen was: 
• 
• 
• 
LUM 75 mg/IVA 94 mg q12h for subjects weighing 7 to <9 kg; 
LUM 100 mg /IVA 125 mg q12h for subjects weighing 9 to <14 kg; and 
LUM 150 mg /IVA 188 mg q12h for subjects weighing ≥14 kg

Overall, in subjects 12 to <24 months of age, the majority of LUM and IVA exposures were within the 
exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age (gray shaded region) for each dose group.

Further available data in children < 9 kg:  
All available PK data for LUM/IVA in children weighing 7 to <9 kg were previously incorporated in the 
popPK models presented in Report R231. These data included 2 subjects in Part A and 1 subject in Part 
B, resulting in 3 total subjects in the weight group. The Part A data were not displayed in the final 
model outputs because the model outputs focused on Part B pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures. Data 
from the 2 children aged 1 to <2 years weighing 7 to <9 kg dosed in Part A are added to Figure 3 
Panel A  for the final models presented in Report R231.

For the lowest weight group (7-<9 kg), the predictions from the popPK model are generally consistent 
with the observed IVA PK exposures from the 3 subjects, whereas the LUM PK predictions are lower 
than the observed LUM PK exposures from these subjects 1 to <2 years of age weighing 7 to <9 kg, 
probably due to high variability in PK. 
New analyses have been added to the modelling provided in the initial line extension submission for 
patients 1 to <2 years of age. These analyses evaluated if alternative models (i.e., different maturation 
functions or weight adjustments) might better fit the available data and whether or not those models 
support the proposed dosing regimen.  
The results of this modelling demonstrated that: 
1)  Data from LUM/IVA treatment in subjects 1 to <2 years of age supports that ontogeny does 
not impact PK for this age group, suggesting that full CYP maturation is achieved by 
approximately 1 year of age. This is consistent with a fast maturation rate, as reported in the 
literature. The differences between the model predictions and the observed data for the 7 to 
<9 kg weight group (observed when plotted against weight but not against age) are not 
attributable to maturation effects not captured by the PK models. 
2)  The differences between the model predictions and the observed data for the 7 to <9 kg 
weight group were tried to be corrected with an empirical adjustment to the submitted models, 
although there is no physiological rationale for such an adjustment. 
In comparison to the final models from Report R231, this adjustment was shown to improve 
the OFV by 5.5 points for LUM and 2.4 points for IVA. Diagnostic plots for both the random 
effects of CL/F versus binned weight group improved for both LUM and IVA. Conditional 
weighted residuals (CWRES) plots stratified by weight group also improved for both LUM  and 
IVA. Subsequently, the updated models (with weight empirical adjustment) were used to 
simulate the proposed dosing regimen for CF subjects 1 to <2 years of age as a sensitivity 
analysis to explore the impact of these adjustments on the predicted exposures for subjects 
weighing 7 to <9 kg. Similar to the predicted exposures from Report R231, the majority of the 
predicted exposures from the updated models for subjects weighing 7 to <9 kg were within the 
adult exposure range previously shown to be safe and efficacious (Figure 3). 
According to the MAH, while empirical weight adjustments improved the diagnostics for both the LUM 
and IVA models, it is difficult to justify inclusion of these adjustments for several key reasons. First, 
the OFV improvements were modest at best, with neither adjustment being significant at the P<0.01 
level. Second, there is no physiological rationale for why subjects weighing 7 to <9 kg would have 
additional altered clearance compared to heavier subjects beyond the effect of allometric scaling, 
especially as this altered clearance is not attributable to maturation. Furthermore, this adjustment 
introduces an unrealistic step-change in predicted LUM exposures upon crossing the 9 kg threshold as 
shown in Panel B of Figure 4. 
The most reasonable explanation for the observed exposures for the 3 subjects in the 7 to <9 kg 
weight group is that these subjects are generally within the variability expected due to weight effects 
for the originally submitted models.

3)  The most reasonable explanation for the differences between the model predictions and the 
observed data for the 7 to <9 kg weight group is that the PK are consistent with the submitted 
models, and the observed data are generally within the expected variability in PK for this 
weight group. This conclusion is supported by an assessment of the model predictability of 
steady-state AUC versus weight.

Please refer to section 2.6.5 Clinical efficacy for the evaluation of PD endpoints. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study 122 is a phase 3, 2-part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of 
Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in Subjects 1 to Less Than 2 Years of Age With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous for 
F508del consisting of two parts: 
Part A to evaluate the PK and safety of LUM/IVA over 15 days of dosing.  
Part B to evaluate the safety of LUM/IVA dosing over 24 weeks in this paediatric CF population.  
The PK Set contained data for all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, which included 7 
subjects in Part A Cohort 1 (12 to <24 months), 7 subjects in Part A Cohort 2 (12 to <18 months), and 
46 subjects in Part B (1-2 years).  
Previously developed popPK modeling (Report P187 and Report Q052) were used to conduct 
simulations to determine the weight bounds that would achieve LUM and IVA exposures similar to the 
exposures observed in adult CF subjects in Part B of study 122. Report R230 included data from Part 
A from both Cohorts (18 to <24 months and 12 to <18 months) and a data cut through week 4 from 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023

Part B of Study 122 (12 to <24 months). R231 Population PK study report is a continuation of the 
analysis presented in Report R230, and includes the final data from Study 122 Part B (all subjects 12 
to <24 months through week 24). According to the MAH, simulations from PopPK R231 support the 
dose selection for Orkambi (LUM/IVA combination therapy) in subjects 12 to <24 months of age with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygous for the F508del mutation.  
In the final model R231 maturation effect has been considered consistent with a fast maturation rate, 
whereby according to the MAH the full maturation is achieved around 1 year of age. However, no data 
supporting this assumption was provided and literature data on ontogeny functions show that 
differences may exist (Lang et al., 2020 and Wildt et al., 1999). Therefore, the MAH was asked to 
better justify the assumption of a fast maturation in this age range. The MAH explained that the effect 
of maturation has been explored in the initial model R230, in which fast and slow maturation rates 
were analysed, but only the fast maturation effect was included in the model R231. In order to support 
the fast maturation rate in both R230 and R231 models, the MAH used maturation parameters fixed to 
values reported in the literature for gentamicin. The CHMP noted that gentamicin is mainly renally 
cleared with a negligible impact of hepatic elimination thus, questioning the adequacy of this substrate 
for the fast metabolism hypothesis also considering that data from literature (de Wildt et al, 1999) 
suggests that CYP3A4 approximately reaches 50% of adult levels between 6 and 12 months of age. 
Overall, data seems to suggest that weight has major impact on the PK variability as compared to age 
and therefore the issue was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Applying the corrected cut off of 7 to <9 kg to phase A of study 122 (modified after a preliminary 
revision of data), only two subjects (8.9 kg and 8.1 kg both of 12 months of age) were enrolled. Thus, 
overall, only three patients (of which 2 in the phase A and 1 in the phase B of the study) in the above 
mentioned range have been studied. The predictive performance of the population pharmacokinetic 
models was considered hampered by the CHMP due to the limited number of patients in the lower 
weight subset. The MAH was asked to present any other available PK data for lumacaftor/ivacaftor in 
children weighing less than 9 kg, applying a full extrapolation to the under 9 kg subgroup and to define 
a bodyweight cut-off for the paediatric patient population >12 months of age.  
In response, the MAH confirmed that there are no additional LUM/IVA data in children weighting 7 to 
<9kg. Only 3 children aged 1 to <2 years weighing 7 to <9 kg have been treated in the Study 122 (2 
in Part A and 1 in Part B) and submitted the final model outputs showing also the 2 patients in Part A, 
previously excluded. The IVA exposure of these 2 patients is lower than that observed for the patient 
in Part B, however falls within the exposure in adults. For LUM, one patient in Part A showed lower 
exposure of that in Part B and falls within the adult exposure, while the other one showed higher 
exposure of that in Part B and falls outside the adult exposure.  
In order to verify if this variability in exposure could be explained by a difference in weight, the MAH 
submitted further analyses with an empirical adjustment of weight on CL/F using the model R231. This 
adjustment slightly improves the OFV, diagnostic plots and CWRES for patients <9 kg, however, 
although the predicted exposure is still contained in that of adults, it is not possible to verify if the 
empirical adjustment of weight should be retained in the model (predicted exposures for subjects 7 to 
<9 kg cannot be considered reliable since it is based/verified only on three patients weighing 8-9 kg). 
Uncertainties remain regarding the unexplained variability in subjects weighting 7-9 kg difficult to be 
elucidated on the basis of only scarce observed data (3 patients). 
Despite this consideration strictly related to PK variability in the younger patients and despite the very 
small numbers recruited for this age brackets (particularly for those in the 7-9kg weight bracket), 
considering the sufficiently known efficacy of LUM/IVA, and the relatively manageable safety profile to 
restrict use to those children over 9 kg is in effect delaying the start of treatment that would seem to 
be overly cautious. Therefore the CHMP agreed that further cut-off weight was not necessary. In 
Assessment report

addition a study is planned in children aged from birth to 1 year (Study 19)  the MAH will collect PK 
data in this study and submit them with an update of a popPK model when available, in agreement 
with the CHMP request. 
Overall, exposures for both, LUM and IVA in Study 122 were within the exposure range for subjects ≥
18 years of age. The median AUC0-12h value for LUM in all 12 to <24 month subjects (185 µg·
h/mL,) was close to the adult median. The median IVA exposure for all 12 to <24 months subjects 
(5.12 μg·h/mL) was slightly higher than the median IVA exposure in adult subjects, but it was 
comparable to IVA exposures from other paediatric age groups and well below the median exposure 
in subjects 12 to <24 months of age (8.9 μg·h/mL) receiving the IVA monotherapy dose of 50 mg 
q12h (Report N364). Mean LUM and IVA exposure by age group have been updated in section 5.2 of 
the SmPC.  
Overall, the simulation results for LUM and IVA indicate that the studied regimen is appropriate for 
this age group. 
Special population: 
Since the effect of maturation observed in subjects 1 to <2 years of age was considered minimal and 
LUM and IVA exposures under the proposed dose regimens are predicted to be similar for subjects 1 to 
<2 years of age and subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the impact of hepatic impairment on the 
exposures for subjects 1 to <2 years of age are expected to be similar to that predicted for 2 through 
5 years of age. Thus, the same dose adjustments are proposed for both age groups. Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC has been updated with recommendations also for 1 to <2 years subgroup, this was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
As the effect of maturation observed in subjects 1 to <2 years of age was considered minimal, 
recommendations for LUM/IVA dose adjustments for CF patients 1 to <2 years of age in the setting of 
CYP3A inhibition are consistent with those for CF patients from 2 through 5 years of age. Thus, the 
same recommendations are added in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Although some uncertainties remain on the modelling analysis pertaining to the age brackets 7-9 kg, 
these issues strictly related to PK are overcome by the sufficiently known efficacy and manageable 
safety profile of LUM/IVA. In addition the MAH committed to further develop and submit an update of 
the popPK model as new PK data become available from studies in younger cohorts. 
The CHMP considered that the clinical pharmacology package was sufficient to support the following 
dosing recommendations in patients 1 to <2 years of age:

Efficacy in the 1 to <2-years group is extrapolated from data from older populations of subjects. The 
main study in children 1 to <2 years, evaluated the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of 
Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in patients With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous for F508del. PD data were assessed 
as a secondary objective in the second part of the study.

Study 122: A Phase 3, 2-part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics 
of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in Subjects 1 to Less Than 2 Years of Age With Cystic Fibrosis, 
Homozygous for F508del. 
Part A was designed to evaluate the PK and safety of LUM/IVA over 15 days of dosing. The evaluation 
of LUM/IVA as multiple doses allowed for the assessment of the time-dependent induction effect of 
LUM on the metabolism of IVA. The duration of dosing in Part A was selected to evaluate the PK and 
safety endpoints when the induction effect of LUM on the metabolism of IVA was anticipated to have 
reached steady state. 
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety of LUM/IVA dosing over 24 weeks in this paediatric CF 
population. In addition, the PD effects and PK of multiple doses of LUM/IVA over 24 weeks of dosing 
were evaluated, and a 2-week Washout Period was included in order to evaluate the off-drug PD 
response.

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
•  Weight at the Screening Visit must have been within the weight limits as defined for the study 
drug dose levels or according to the dosing guidelines 
•  Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of CF at the Screening Visit. CF was defined as:  
o 
 CF-causing mutations (all as documented in the subject’s medical record)  
▪  Subjects must have been homozygous for F508del (genotype confirmed at the 
Screening Visit): If a genotype test had been performed previously and was 
documented in the subject’s medical record, the subject was not required to be 
tested for CFTR genotype at screening, but the subject’s eligibility must have 
been approved by the Vertex medical monitor. If a historic genotype result was 
not available at the Screening Visit or if the historic genotype result was not 
approved by the Vertex medical monitor, the subject was tested for CFTR

before the first dose. Note: Newborn screening genotype results were not 
sufficient for eligibility. 
AND (1 of the 2 criteria below)  
o  chronic sinopulmonary disease OR gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities  
OR  
o  a SwCl value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis as documented in 
the subject’s medical record OR from the SwCl test result obtained at the Screening 
Visit. If an eligible historical SwCl result was documented in the subject’s medical 
record, that result alone (and not the Screening Visit result) may have been used to 
determine eligibility. 
•  Subjects with stable CF disease as deemed by the investigator at the Screening Visit. 
Main exclusion criteria 
•  History of any comorbidity reviewed at the Screening Visit that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, might have confounded the results of the study or posed an additional risk in 
administering LUM/IVA to the subject. For example, a history of cirrhosis with portal 
hypertension. 
•  Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at the Screening Visit 
•  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at the Screening Visit: • Hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL 
·Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or total bilirubin 2 × upper limit 
of normal (ULN) • Chronic kidney disease of Stage 3 (estimated glomerular filtration rate

antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 (first dose of LUM/IVA). 
•  A standard 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc >450 msec at the Screening Visit. If QTc 
exceeded 450 msec at the Screening Visit, the ECG should have been repeated 2 more times 
during the Screening Period, and the average of the 3 QTc values should have been used to 
determine the subject’s eligibility. 
•  History of solid organ or hematological transplantation. 
•  Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study (including studies investigating 
LUM and/or IVA) within 30 days of the Screening Visit. • A Washout Period of 5 terminal half-

Lipase and amylase were collected as part of safety assessments. The results are discussed with the 
other PD assessments relating to pancreatic function because they are useful indicators of pancreatic 
inflammation/injury. Only descriptive analysis of safety was performed. 
•  Sample size 
Part A Approximately 10 subjects were planned for enrollment. No formal sample size calculations 
were performed. The number of subjects in Part A is common in clinical pharmacology studies and was 
considered sufficient to achieve the PK objectives of Part A. 
Part B Approximately 30 subjects were planned for enrollment. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, 
approximately 27 subjects were to complete Part B. No formal sample size calculations were 
performed. The number of subjects in Part B was deemed adequate to meet the primary safety 
objective.

Analysis Sets  
The analysis sets were defined separately for Parts A and B.  
All Subjects Set was defined as all subjects who signed informed consent and enrolled, or were 
dosed, in Part A or Part B respectively. This analysis set was used for all individual subject data listings 
and the disposition summary table, unless specified otherwise.  
Safety Set for Part A included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A. The 
Part A safety analyses were based on the Safety Set overall and by cohort, unless otherwise specified.  
Safety Set for Part B included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B. The 
Part B safety analyses were based on the Safety Set overall, unless otherwise specified.

Study completion: 29 October 2021 (date last subject completed the last visit in Part B) 
•  Conduct of the study 
In Version 2.0 (04 December 2019), the following key changes were included:  
•  Updated the planned dosing regimen based on the PK results from Part A Cohort 1 as follows:  
o  Added a lower dose of LUM 75 mg/IVA 94 mg for subjects who weighed 7 to <10 kg at 
screening for Part A and Part B.  
o  Updated the lower weight bound from 8 kg to 10 kg for the LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg 
dose in Part B.  
•  Added the additional endpoint for absolute change from baseline in weight-for-length z-score 
at Week 24 for Part B.  
In addition, 2 Justification for Dose Selection Memoranda were implemented to communicate updated 
dosing regimens after review of available PK data and the updated popPK models, as summarized in

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This variation concerns the extension of the indication of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) to also include 
children with CF who are homozygous for delta 508 from age 1- 2 years.

A new granule preparation is added to dose the lighter children within this proposed new age group, 1 
year to 2 years. The additional new strength granule preparation 75/94 mg is intended to dose children 
aged 1-2 years who weight 7-9kg. The already approved 100/125mg and 150/188mg granule 
preparations are proposed to dose children aged 1-2 years who weight 9 to <14kg and ≥14kg 
respectively. 
A dose-response study was not performed, but dose finding was supported by population PK analysis 
aimed at targeting a similar systemic exposure as that of older paediatric and adult subjects that has 
been shown to be efficacious. The simulations provided based on this model indicate that the proposed 
dosing recommendations are reasonable as children aged 1 to less than 2 years would present an 
exposure similar to that in adults. See section 2.6.3 Discussion on clinical pharmacology.  
The proposed indication extension is based on results from Study 122, a Phase 3, 2-part, open-label, 
multicentre study in subjects 1 to <2 years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del. Part A was 
designed to evaluate the safety and PK of LUM/IVA over a treatment period of 15 days. Enrolment was 
sequential: Cohort 1 (subjects 18 to <24 months of age [N = 7]) and Cohort 2 (subjects 12 to <18 
months of age [N = 7]). Safety, tolerability, and available PK data from Part A were reviewed to 
determine the dose(s) to be evaluated in Part A Cohort 2 and Part B. 
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) of LUM/IVA over 24 
weeks of treatment.  
The MAH therefore does not present controlled, randomised data for this age group, and instead 
provides open label, uncontrolled data for this age group. Given the lack of controlled data for this age 
group, the MAH is also relying on a PK and PD (primarily sweat chloride) bridge to the randomised 
controlled data from older age groups. Overall, this approach can in principle be considered acceptable 
given:  
1. the challenges in recruiting very young children to clinical trials  
2. practical difficulties in reliably and accurately carrying out respiratory based disease assessment in 
children under the age of 6 years  
3. lack of consensus on the magnitude of clinically relevant effect on the various markers of CF 
severity in younger children  
4. recognition that definite efficacy improvement is difficult to demonstrate in a very young population 
with relatively mild disease at baseline.  
5. recognition that the same disease process applies in children age 1-2 years as in older children and 
adults with CF.  
Of note a similar approach was used to extend the indication to the age 2-5 year old age group, where 
the applicant also presented a small, open label study in that age group and drew a PK/PD bridge to 
the data from older children/adults. For the 6-11 year old age group, a randomised placebo controlled 
trial was provided, using LCI2.5 as the primary EP- and this demonstrated a small LS mean treatment 
difference of -1.09 (95%CI, -1.43, -0.75) P<0.0001 for the absolute change through week 24.  
Efficacy/PD data was collected from Study 122 Part B. In addition, the MAH proposes that efficacy in 
the 1-2 years old age group can be extrapolated from the placebo controlled phase 3 data from older 
populations. 
The majority of subjects completed the study (93.5%) only 3 subjects discontinued due to the AE 
occurrence (severity not specified), withdrawal of consent (not due to AE), and other reason. 87% of 
patients rolled over the extension study.

In Part B, 46 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug, 97.8% completed study drug treatment 
and 93.5% completed the study. 
Baseline characteristics and concomitant medication use reflect a typical population of CF patients. 
Subjects were balanced between males and females, the majority being White. The median age at 
baseline was 18.5 months (range: 12 to 23 months). Median of weight for age z score was 0.51 and 
length for age z score -0.19. All subjects had pancreatic failure, 95.7% clinical manifestation of CF lung 
disease and roughly 24% gastroesophageal reflux. Concomitant medication use was typical of a CF 
population in this age group. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate.  
LUM/IVA was administered to each Part A cohort or in Part B in accordance with the weight-based 
dosing regimens. See section 2.6.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology. 
Change in percent predict FEV1 (the recommended primary endpoint to be used for registration studies 
as outlined in the EMA CF guideline, EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008) is not feasible in children from birth 
through 5 years of age because FEV1 involves spirometry, which cannot be performed by young 
children as forced manoeuvres are needed. Therefore FEV1 was not assessed in study 122. Instead the 
following additional PD assessments related to efficacy were evaluated in Part B: (1) body mass index 
(BMI) and BMI-for-age z-score,  (2) weight, weight-for-age z-score, and weight-for-length z-score, (3) 
length and length-for-age z-score, (4) pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and CF-related hospitalizations, 
(5) fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) levels, (6) immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, (7) microbiology 
cultures, (8) fecal calprotectin levels, and (9) multiple-breath washout (MBW) (optional LCI substudy). 
Part B included a 2-week Washout Period to evaluate off-drug PD response. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary objectives of the study were PK and safety and are described in the dedicated sections. 
Secondary objectives were PD markers which are those commonly used in CF studies and PK 
endpoints. These PD markers are used as supportive of clinical benefit.  
Absolute change from baseline in SwCl at week 24 was a secondary PD endpoint in Study 122 Part B. 
SwCl is a direct in vivo PD measure of CFTR function. The mean (SD) SwCl at baseline was 104.2 (7.7) 
mmol/L. LUM/IVA treatment resulted in a substantial improvement (reduction) in SwCl as shown by 
the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24: -29.1 (13.5) mmol/L (95% CI -34.8, -
23.4). The decline in mean sweat chloride to ~ 75 mmol/L value was still at a higher value than normal 
range (< 30 mmol/L). The magnitude of improvement in SwCl after 24 weeks of treatment was 
consistent with that observed in other studies including CF subjects with a different age range and 
treated with LUM/IVA. Although no patient achieved normalisation of SwCl, the MAH provided 
reference to natural history data to justify that improvement in CFTR function by 10-20%, in patients 
homozygous for F508del, would be expected to result in clinically meaningful benefit. 
SwCl decline at week 24 was very similar to that observed at earlier time points (i.e. week 4 and 12) 
suggesting that the maximum effect was displayed early, and it remained stable/not increasing over 
time. This is likely related to the mechanism of action of the drug consisting of restoration of the 
biochemical defect by the combined corrector/potentiator action of LUM/IVA. At the Follow-up (Week 
26), after the 2-week Washout Period, the SwCl concentration returned to approximately baseline, with 
a mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 26 of -3.5 (11.8) mmol/L (95% CI: -8.3, 1.4) 
supporting that the effect is due to LUM/IVA. SwCl results have been reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
The mean change in sweat chloride is within the range of the decrease seen in older children and adult 
patients.

Nutritional status has a significant effect on pulmonary disease progression and survival in patients 
with cystic fibrosis.  As a consequence, the nutritional status of children with CF is closely followed. 
Other secondary endpoints were related to growth parameters (weight-for-length z-score and BMI, 
weight, length, and their associated z-scores). These values were normal at baseline and remained 
stable over 24 weeks of LUM/IVA treatment.  
Z-scores for growth parameters were in the normal range at baseline. A slight increase, absolute 
change from baseline, was noted at week 24 for parameters such as median weight (of 1.3 kg) and 
length (of 5.1 cm). The observed changes in this age range (1-2 y) across a 6 month period seem 
limited, hence it is difficult to dissect the improvement due to growth and/or an amelioration of 
nutritional status from improved pancreatic function due to LUM/IVA treatment.  
The pancreas is one of the earliest organs affected in CF patients who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation, a high fraction of whom develop pancreatic insufficiency. Therefore  others endpoints related 
to markers of pancreatic exocrine function were evaluated. These endpoints hold the potential to 
address whether exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be prevented or improved. 
Fecal elastase (FE-1) is a diagnostic measure of pancreatic exocrine sufficiency, with a lack of elastase 
output in stool being considered indicative of pancreatic insufficiency (<200 µg/g). Rescue of 
pancreatic function will result in an increase in FE-1 levels. The mean (SD) FE-1 level at baseline was 
9.7 (8.1) mg/kg therefore below the threshold of 200 µg/g (equivalent to 200 mg/kg) established for 
pancreatic insufficiency. The mean (SD) absolute change FE-1 at Week 24 was 73.1 (112.6) mg/kg 
showing an increase corresponding to an improvement although below the 200 mg/kg cut-off. A 
subgroup of 4 out of the 28 (14.3%) subjects with both baseline and Week 24 values had FE-1 values 
≥200 mg/kg at Week 24 therefore achieving a level above the pancreatic function insufficiency cut-off.  
Evaluation of Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) is used in clinical practice as part of newborn 
screening for CF wherein elevated levels at birth are associated with disease. Over time, however, 
patients with CF show a longitudinal decline in IRT with nondetectable levels observed around 5 years 
of age, indicating a loss of pancreatic tissue. A decrease in serum IRT levels was observed by Week 4 
and remained below baseline over the 24 weeks of LUM/IVA treatment. The mean (SD) absolute 
change in serum IRT from baseline was -295.5 (329.9) g/L (95% CI: -416.6, -174.5) at Week 24, 
suggesting improvement in pancreatic inflammation/injury with LUM/IVA treatment. 
Even though total amylase and lipase are collected for safety purposes, they are presented under 
efficacy assessment as both are thought to be also markers of pancreatic inflammation. Limited 
evidence has been provided showing the course of serum lipase levels in young infants with cystic 
fibrosis. An evaluation of the classical markers of exocrine function such as lipase and amylase was 
performed. Lipase levels were elevated at baseline (the mean (SD) lipase at baseline was 71.26 
(81.05) U/L (normal range: 4 to 31 U/L). The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 
was -26.77 (53.92) U/L. The decrease started early (by week 4) and was maintained through week 24.   
Total amylase levels were normal at baseline (mean (SD) at baseline was 66.7 (31.7) U/L (normal 
range: 8 to 79 U/L). Pancreatic amylase levels at baseline were below the lower limit of normal at 
baseline (the mean (SD) pancreatic amylase level at baseline was 10.7 (7.9) U/L (normal range: 13 to 
53 U/L). The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was -4.6 (27.5) U/L for total 
amylase and -2.1 (5.3) U/L for pancreatic amylase, respectively. Therefore LUM/IVA treatment was 
accompanied by a decrease of pancreatic enzymes reflecting a better pancreatic function.  
Although different markers of pancreatic function have been used overall supporting an improvement 
of the exocrine pancreatic function, longer data are needed to confirm the actual impact on pancreatic 
function.

Intestinal inflammation is a feature of CF and fecal calprotectin has been shown to be increased in 
paediatric patients with CF potentially contributing to suboptimal growth in this population. However, 
specificities related to the age range 1-2 years of age need to be considered. A study conducted from 
Garg M et al. compared fecal calprotectin levels in CF and healthy children (HC) 0-10 years old. At 
birth, calprotectin levels in CF children were significantly lower than HC suggesting the gut 
environment in CF is altered from the early years of life. By four years of age, this trend reverses and 
calprotectin is consistently higher in CF patients compared with HC due to intestinal inflammation, 
indicating that calprotectin has potential use as a gastrointestinal endpoint in older children. Hence this 
data suggests age-dependency and careful interpretation of fecal calprotectin is required in children 
under four years with CF (Garg M et al., Journal of Cystic Fibrosis Volume 16, Issue 5, September 
2017). 
At baseline mean (SD) fecal calprotectin was 226.06 (279.26) mg/kg, higher than the commonly used 
cut off of > 50 mg/kg. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was -106.63 
(186.98) mg/kg (95% CI: -180.60, -32.66). Starting from Week 4 a decrease was observed, and 
sustained over the 24 weeks. Overall, a decrease in fecal calprotectin levels was shown reflecting 
amelioration of intestinal inflammation. 
CF PEx are a compilation of patient signs and symptoms that often result in the need for aggressive 
treatment, including the use of intravenous antibiotics that may require hospitalization. PEx are the 
major cause of morbidity and decreased quality of life for CF patients. Pulmonary exacerbations [PEx]) 
and CF related hospitalization are considered in this section as indirect measure of efficacy. 9 (19.6%) 
subjects had PEx and 15 events were reported; 3 (6.5%) subjects undergone hospitalization and 4 
events were reported. The event rate per patient-year was 0.6 for PEx and 0.2 for CF-related 
hospitalizations. 
Overall, data coming from PD markers are supportive of LUM/IVA clinical efficacy in the age range 1-2 
years. 
In the Study 122 no specific endpoints assessing pulmonary function have been included due to the 
difficulties in performing assessment in this age range. A substudy aimed at assessing LCI assessment 
included only one subject therefore not informative. The MAH was asked to comment further on the 
reasons why the LCI/Multiple breath washout substudy did not happen, and the feasibility of this 
assessment in this age group. The MAH explained that the lung clearance index sub-study was optional 
in Study 122 as this modality was not available in all sites, and this endpoint was exploratory only. The 
MAH has sufficiently explained why there were no LCI data collected in the Study. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, it is agreed that a relevant PD effect (indirectly with a PD/Sweat Chloride secondary endpoint), 
has been demonstrated in the open label Study 122 in CF patients homozygous for F509del-CFTR aged 
1-2 years administered with the new FDC combination granule preparations of Orkambi at the 
proposed weight based posologies.  
The data presented in this application supporting the approval in the paediatric patients aged from 1 to 
2 years of age are based on a safety PK study with PD parameters provided as secondary endpoints. 
The number of patients included is also limited which can be acceptable. However, in view of the above 
and considering that clinical efficacy data were not collected the MAH was asked to extend the ongoing 
PAES study (2-5 years of age) to recruit also children aged 1-2 years. The MAH agreed on this 
extension anticipating that the study endpoints will be the same as the protocol for 2-5 years of age 
and that a protocol will be submitted by end of June 2023.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) 
Based on an agreed protocol, the Applicant should conduct a long-term 
effectiveness study to compare disease progression among children with CF 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR and are aged 1 through 5 years at the time of 
Orkambi treatment initiation versus disease progression among concurrent 
matched cohort of children with CF who have never received Orkambi 
treatment, in addition to a longitudinal historical cohort.

Table 29 AEs Occurring in At Least ≥ 10% of Subjects by PT, Safety Set, Part B 
AEs by Severity The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild (52.2%) or moderate (39.1%) in 
severity. Two (4.3%) subjects had AEs considered severe in intensity. One subject had severe AEs of 
ALT increased and AST increased that resulted in treatment discontinuation and were considered 
related to study drug. The second subject had a severe AE of infective pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) 
of CF, which was considered unlikely related to study drug and resolved with treatment. No life-
threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AEs occurred. 
AEs by Relationship Two (4.3%) subjects had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related 
to study drug: 1 subject had an SAE of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) and 1 subject had 
severe AEs of ALT increased and AST increased.  
14 (30.4%) subjects had AEs considered to be possibly related to study drug and 28 (60.9%) subjects 
had AEs considered to be unlikely related or not related to study drug.  
By PT, the most common AEs assessed by the investigator as being related or possibly related (≥5% 
incidence overall) to study drug were constipation, vomiting, and cough (6.5% subjects each). 
AESI 
Adverse Events of Special Interest AESIs were defined as AEs of elevated transaminases, respiratory 
events, and respiratory symptoms.

Elevated Transaminases: Four (8.7%) subjects had an AESI of elevated transaminases. None were 
serious, and the majority of events were mild or moderate in severity. One (2.2%) subject had AEs of 
ALT and AST increased that were assessed by the investigator to be severe in intensity and resulted in 
treatment discontinuation. The remaining subjects did not have study drug interrupted. The mean 
time-to-onset of first event was 98 days. There was only 1 event with a duration, which was 61 days. 
Dyspnoea: There was 1 (2.2%) subject who had an AE of dyspnoea that led to treatment interruption. 
Dyspnoea is an event that is included in both categories of respiratory event AESIs and respiratory 
symptom AESIs. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Part A 
There were no AEs leading to death nor SAEs. 
Part B 
There were no AEs leading to death.  
Five (10.9%) subjects had SAEs: 3 subjects had SAEs of infective PEx of CF, 1 subject had an SAE of 
post procedural fever, and 1 subject had an SAE of DIOS. All SAEs were assessed by the investigator 
to be moderate or mild in severity. One SAE (DIOS) was assessed by the investigator to be related to 
study drug and treatment was interrupted. The other SAEs were assessed by the investigator to be not 
related or unlikely related to study drug, and these SAEs did not lead to study drug interruption or 
discontinuation. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Part A 
No clinically relevant trends were observed in chemistry parameters.  
No subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN, nor total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
Hematology No clinically relevant trends were observed in hematology parameters. No subjects had 
AEs related to hematology findings. 
Vital Signs No clinically relevant trends were observed for blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, 
temperature, or respiratory rate. No subjects had AEs related to vital signs findings.

Other Clinical Chemistry Parameters  
No clinically relevant trends were observed in other chemistry parameters. Two (4.3%) subjects had 
AEs related to other chemistry findings (excluding LFT) results. One subject had an AE of blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased and 1 subject had an AE of lipase increased. Neither AE was serious 
or led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. Both AEs resolved without treatment. 
Hematology No clinically relevant trends were observed in hematology parameters. One subject had an 
AE of neutropenia that was considered mild in severity; the AE was not serious and did not lead to 
treatment interruption or discontinuation. The AE of neutropenia resolved without treatment. 
Vital Signs No clinically relevant trends were observed for BP, pulse rate, temperature, or respiratory 
rate. No subjects had AEs related to vital signs findings.  
•  Blood Pressure: Mean changes in BP fluctuated over the course of the study, but there were no 
clinically meaningful changes from baseline. Mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 
24 was 1.9 (18.7) for SBP and -0.5 (13.3) for DBP. There were no AEs of blood pressure 
increased. Values ≥95th percentile occurred at least twice in 44 (95.7%) subjects for SBP and 
in all 46 (100%) subjects for DBP. The percentages of subjects with SBP and DBP values ≥95th 
percentile showed no pattern of increase over time when evaluated by visit. 
• 
Pulse Oximetry: No clinically relevant trends were observed for pulse oximetry. No subjects 
had AEs related to pulse oximetry findings.  
• 
Electrocardiograms: No clinically relevant trends were identified in changes in ECG findings. No 
subjects had AEs related to ECG findings. 
No subjects had cataracts.

Part A 
No AEs leading to treatment interruption were reported. One subject (Cohort 1) had an AE of rash that 
led to treatment discontinuation. The AE was assessed by the investigator to be moderate in severity 
and possibly related to study drug. The AE resolved without treatment. 
Part B 
One (2.2%) subject had AEs (ALT increased and AST increased) leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Both AEs were assessed by the investigator to be severe in intensity and related to study drug. 
Two (4.3%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. One subject had an SAE of Distal 
intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) that was assessed by the investigator to be moderate in 
severity and related to study drug. Study drug was interrupted, and the event resolved with treatment. 
One subject had an AE of dyspnoea that was assessed by the investigator to be moderate in severity 
and possibly related to study drug. Study drug was interrupted, and the event resolved with treatment. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Since the International Birth Date of 02 July 2015, it is estimated that 24,168 patients (representing 
45,998 patient-years) have been treated with commercial LUM/IVA cumulatively as of 19 May 2021. 
The benefit-risk profile of LUM/IVA remains favourable. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety was the primary objective of Part B and a secondary objective of Part A of study 122. In part A, 
14 subjects were enrolled, the mean (SD) LUM/IVA exposure was 14.2 (4.2) days. In part B, 46 
subjects received at least one dose of study drug, the mean (SD) exposure was of 166.5 (16.3) days. 
LUM/IVA safety data from clinical trials and post marketing are available from CF subjects >2 years. 
Although specificities related to the age range 1-2 years should be considered the overall safety data 
set coming from older CF subjects is considered supportive.  
Overview of AEs: in part A 85.7% subjects had at least 1 AE. All AEs were mild or moderate in 
severity. There were no deaths or serious AEs. One subject had an AE assessed as related to study 
drug; one subject discontinued LUM/IVA due to an AE. An AE of rash was reported in 3 subjects. All 
AEs of rash were non-serious and did not require treatment. One subject had an AE of rash that led to 
treatment discontinuation. For all subjects, the AEs of rash resolved. 
In part B forty-four (95.7%) subjects had at least 1 AE, and 16 (34.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE 
considered related to LUM/IVA (related [4.3%] or possibly related [30.4%], as determined by the 
investigator). The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (24 [52.2%] subjects) or 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 60/73 
 
 
 
 
moderate (18 [39.1%] subjects) in severity. 2 (4.3%) subjects had severe AEs. No subjects had life-
threatening AEs. There were no deaths. Five (10.9%) subjects had SAE. Of these 3 were PEx reported 
in CF subjects.  
One (2.2%) subject discontinued LUM/IVA due to an AE; 2 (4.3%) subjects interrupted LUM/IVA due 
to an AE, one was a SAE of DIOS assessed as related to study drug. DIOS is described in CF 
subjects in approximately 10% of CF patients after lung transplantation (J Gastrointest Surg  2009 
Aug;13(8):1448-53). 
With reference to AESI, 8.7% of subjects had elevated transaminases.  
10.9% of subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 2 (4.3%) subjects had ALT or AST >5 × ULN, and 1 
(2.2%) subject had ALT or AST >8 × ULN over the duration of the study. None of these events was 
serious, one was severe leading to treatment discontinuation. Hepatobiliary adverse reactions including 
increase of transaminases is already included in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 (common ADR). A 
short description of these ADRs for patients 1 to less than 2 years has been added in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.  
1 (2.2%) subject had an AE of dyspnoea that led to treatment interruption. Respiratory adverse 
reactions including dyspnoea are already included in the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Laboratory findings: in part B one (2.2%) subject had an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level >1.5 × ULN 
during the study, the AE was not serious and did not lead to treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
No subjects had total bilirubin >2 × ULN. This information has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
in addition, hepatobiliary adverse reactions are already included in the SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8 
(common ADR). 
One AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increase was reported, this is an ADR common in frequency 
and already reported in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Mean changes in blood pressure fluctuated over the course of the study, but there were no clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline. Effect on blood pressure is also reported in the SmPC sections 4.4 
and 4.8 (common ADR). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
However the safety data exposure in total is relatively small in this age group. This period is too small 
to adequately characterise the safety profile when used in children aged 1-2 years. Long-term safety 
data will be collected in study 124. Study 124, a Category 3 PASS, is an open-label extension of Study 
122 that includes rollover subjects who participated in Study 122 Part B and subjects who did not 
participate in Study 122 Part B and were 12 to <24 months of age at Study 124 Day 1. The objective 
of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of long-term LUM/IVA treatment patients aged 12 to 
<24 months at treatment initiation. The MAH has added this Category 3 PASS as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity. Study outcomes include the important identified risk (respiratory events) 
and important potential risk (cataracts) of the RMP. Results will be submitted in July 2024. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the findings from open label Study 122, support the use of LUM/IVA in subjects 1 through 2 
years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del. The safety profile described from this small study is 
consistent with that reported in CF subjects of other age-ranges; no new safety concerns were 
identified.  
Additional, long-term safety data will be collected for this age group in study 124 (Category 3 study) .

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 11.4 is acceptable.  
However, it is noted that there are no further pharmacovigilance activities ongoing or planned to 
investigate the use of Orkambi in pregnant and lactating women, or the use of Orkambi in patients 
with organ transplant. Therefore, the MAH is asked to re-evaluate the summary of safety concerns at 
the next regulatory opportunity, with a view to potentially removing these two remaining areas of 
missing information from the safety specification. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  Readability testing was previously conducted for the Orkambi 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 
mg granules package leaflet and reviewed during the initial paediatric line extension, 
procedure EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication expansion for Orkambi is for the treatment of CF in patients 1 to 2 years of 
age. 
The underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a loss of CFTR function that arises from a mutation in the 
gene encoding the CFTR protein, has adverse effects that can be observed in newborns and continue to 
progress through adulthood. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating 
salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues. This function is defective in patients with CF 
due to a loss of cell surface expression and/or function of CFTR protein. The failure of mutated CFTR 
protein to regulate chloride transport results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Since 
the introduction and continued advances of newborn and antenatal screening, many patients with CF 
are identified through a positive screening test and subsequently diagnosed within the first year of life. 
Approximately 60% of patients with CF in the EU and 83% of patients with CF in the UK are diagnosed 
by 1 year of age. 
In the US, more than 80% of patients with CF are diagnosed by 2 years of age.CF clearly affects the 
paediatric population, as approximately half of the total CF patient population in the US, EU, Australia, 
and Canada are less than 18 years of age. Even before the widespread adoption of newborn screening, 
the majority of patients with CF were diagnosed in infancy or early childhood due to manifestations of 
the disease. In patients with severe genotypes (e.g., F508del/F508del), pancreatic destruction leading 
to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins in utero, and lung involvement is manifested by pulmonary 
inflammation and infection that begins shortly after birth. Loss of lung function is the major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Infants with CF as young as 1 month show the presence of 
lung disease. Airway inflammation signals the beginning of the destructive cycles of chronic 
inflammation, infection, and irreversible lung damage that are characteristic of CF lung disease.  
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional status are among the most significant clinical 
manifestations of CF in infants. These factors often lead to poor growth with subsequent growth delay, 
poorer cognitive development and are associated with other clinical comorbidities such as decreased 
lung function and survival. Malnourishment is associated with worsening lung function in children with 
CF and is an independent predictor of mortality in this population. Notably, 11.5% of children with CF 
fall below the US CDC’s tenth percentile for weight and 9.8% of children fall below the CDC’s fifth 
percentile for height. Additionally, increased energy expenditure and appetite suppression due to lung 
disease contribute to poor somatic growth and poor nutritional status in young patients with CF. 
Data in the literature suggest that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with 
CF; studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung 
disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening. LUM/IVA targets the 
underlying mechanisms of disease, thus treatment with LUM/IVA at a young age could postpone or 
even prevent the onset of clinical manifestations of CF, such as CF lung disease and impaired exocrine 
pancreatic function.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no cure available for CF. Hence, the goals of current CF therapies are to slow or 
reverse disease progression, manage symptoms and complications such as pancreatic insufficiency and 
respiratory infections, and improve quality of life. The majority of CF therapies currently available, 
including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, target the downstream consequences 
and symptoms of the disease. CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) target the 
underlying cause of CF with the potential to alter the course of the disease. Kalydeco (IVA) and 
Orkambi (LUM/IVA) are the only CFTR modulators approved for CF patients 2 through 5 years of age. 
Kalydeco is approved for CF patients 4 months of age and older for certain genotypes. At this time, 
there is no approved CFTR modulator therapy available for CF patients homozygous for F508del aged 
<2 years of age, therefore the unmet need exists.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 122 is a Phase 3, 2-part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of 
Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in Subjects 1 to Less Than 2 Years of Age With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous for 
F508del. 
Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and PK of LUM/IVA over a treatment period of  15 days. 
Two cohorts were enrolled sequentially in Part A: Cohort 1 (subjects 18 to <24 months  of age [N = 
7]) and Cohort 2 (subjects 12 to <18 months of age [N = 7]). Safety, tolerability, and available PK 
data from Part A were reviewed to determine the dose(s) to be evaluated in Part A Cohort 2 and Part 
B. 
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) of LUM/IVA over 24 weeks 
of treatment. A total of 46 subjects were enrolled and dosed in Part B; subjects 18 to <24 months of 
age [N = 25] were enrolled first, followed by enrollment of subjects 12 to <18 months of age [N = 21]. 
For Part B, the primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; the secondary endpoints were absolute 
change from baseline in SwCl at Week 24 and PK parameters of LUM, IVA, and their respective 
metabolites. The following additional PD assessments related to efficacy were evaluated in Part B: (1) 
body mass index (BMI) and BMI-for-age z-score,  (2) weight, weight-for-age z-score, and weight-for-
length z-score, (3) length and length-for-age z-score, (4) pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and CF-
related hospitalizations, (5) fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) levels, (6) immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) 
levels, (7) microbiology cultures, (8) fecal calprotectin levels, and (9) multiple-breath washout (MBW) 
(optional LCI substudy). Part B included a 2-week Washout Period to evaluate off-drug PD response. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dose finding was supported by population PK analysis aimed at targeting a similar systemic exposure 
as that of older paediatric and adult subjects that has been shown to be efficacious. PK data collected 
during the study 122 showed that subjects 12 to <24 months of age > 9 kg reached comparable 
exposure with older paediatric values and adult values, supporting the proposed dosing 
recommendations.  
This extension of indication to very young CF children, aged 1 to 2 years old, is based on extrapolation 
of Orkambi efficacy from older children and adults to the younger children enrolled in study 122. 
Therefore PD markers commonly used in CF studies were assessed to support clinical efficacy. 
Absolute change from baseline in SwCl at week 24 was a secondary PD endpoint in Study 122 Part B. 
SwCl is a direct in vivo PD measure of CFTR function. An absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in 
SwCl was observed (the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 was -29.1 (13.5) 
Assessment report

mmol/L (95% CI -34.8, -23.4). The maximum effect was displayed early (week 4) and it remained 
stable/not increasing over time. 
A decline in mean sweat chloride to ~ 75 mmol/L value was seen. This result is similar to that seen in 
other studies including CF subjects with a different age range and treated with LUM/IVA. Natural 
history data support that improvement in CFTR function by 10-20%, in patients homozygous for 
F508del, would be expected to result in clinically meaningful benefit. The mean change in sweat 
chloride is within the range of the decrease seen in older children and adult patients. 
Growth parameters (weight-for-length z-score and BMI, weight, length, and their associated z-scores) 
were normal at baseline and remained stable over the 24 weeks of treatment.  
Z-scores for growth parameters were in the normal range at baseline. A slight increase, absolute 
change from baseline, was noted at week 24 for parameters such as median weight (of 1.3 kg) and 
length (of 5.1 cm).  
Other endpoints related to markers of pancreatic exocrine function have been evaluated. 
The mean (SD) fecal elastase (FE-1) level at baseline was below the threshold of 200 µg/g (equivalent 
to 200 mg/kg) established for pancreatic insufficiency. At Week 24 an increase corresponding to an 
improvement was detected (73.1 (112.6) mg/kg) although below the 200 mg/kg cut-off. A subgroup of 
4 out of the 28 (14.3%) subjects with both baseline and Week 24 values had FE-1 values ≥200 mg/kg 
at Week 24 therefore achieving a level above the pancreatic function insufficiency cut-off.  
A decrease in serum Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels was observed by Week 4, and remained 
below baseline over the 24 weeks of LUM/IVA treatment. The mean (SD) absolute change in serum IRT 
from baseline was -295.5 (329.9) g/L (95% CI: -416.6, -174.5) at Week 24, suggesting improvement 
in pancreatic inflammation/injury with LUM/IVA treatment. 
An evaluation of the classical markers of exocrine function such as lipase and amylase was performed 
and a decrease of pancreatic enzymes reflecting a better pancreatic function was noted.  
At baseline mean (SD) fecal calprotectin was 226.06 (279.26) mg/kg, higher than the commonly used 
cut off of > 50 mg/kg. Overall, a decrease (the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 
was -106.63 (186.98) mg/kg (95% CI: -180.60, -32.66) in fecal calprotectin levels was observed 
reflecting amelioration of intestinal inflammation. Starting from Week 4 a decrease was observed and 
sustained over the 24 weeks.  
9 (19.6%) subjects had PEx  and 15 events were reported; 3 (6.5%) subjects undergone 
hospitalization and 4 events were reported. The event rate per patient-year was 0.6 for PEx and 0.2 for 
CF-related hospitalizations. 
Overall, data are considered supportive of efficacy and are consistent with the known Orkambi profile. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties pertain on PK in subjects weighting less than 9 kg due to a relative lack of PK data (only 
3 patients weighing less than 9 kg were enrolled). However, considering the known efficacy of 
LUM/IVA, restricting the use to those children over 9 kg was considered by the CHMP to be overly 
cautious. In addition, the MAH will collect PK data in Study 19 in infants and will submit these data to 
the CHMP to reconfirm the accuracy of the PK model.  
No clinical efficacy endpoints were included in the Safety, PK Study 122, instead PD parameters were 
collected as secondary objective. 
The decline in mean sweat chloride to ~ 75 mmol/L remain substantially higher than normal range for 
sweat chloride (< 30 mmol/L). Although no patients achieved normalisation of sweat chloride, the MAH 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 67/73 
 
 
 
 
provided references from natural history data to justify that improvement in CFTR function by 10-20%, 
in patients homozygous for F508del, would be expected to result in clinically meaningful benefit. The 
magnitude of improvement in SwCl was consistent with that observed in older children and adults. 
Other secondary endpoints were related to growth parameters (weight-for-length z-score and BMI, 
weight, length, and their associated z-scores). The observed changes in this age range (1-2 y) across a 
6 month period seem limited, hence it is difficult to dissect the improvement due to growth and/or an 
amelioration of nutritional status from improved pancreatic function due to LUM/IVA treatment.  
A series of others endpoints related to markers of pancreatic exocrine function have been evaluated. 
Results, overall supported an improvement of the exocrine pancreatic function, however longer data 
are needed to confirm the actual impact on pancreatic function.  
In the study no specific endpoints assessing pulmonary function have been included due to the 
difficulties in performing assessment in this age range. A substudy aimed at assessing LCI assessment 
was planned, however this study was optional and the endpoint only exploratory. Only one subject was 
included, results are therefore not informative.  
Overall, the level of evidence submitted to support efficacy in the patients aged 1 to less than 2 years 
is limited by the lack of a control arm, the sample size of the study, the duration of treatment and the 
uncertainty on whether the pharmacodynamic improvements observed are maintained. 
Additionally no clinical efficacy data in patients age 1 to 2 years old were provided. Thus, the MAH 
agreed to extend the ongoing PAES study (2-5 years of age) to recruit also children aged 1-2 years to 
gain more information on Orkambi efficacy in children aged 12-24 months. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile described from study 122 is generally consistent with that reported in CF subjects of 
other age-ranges; no new safety concerns were identified.  
In part A all AEs were mild or moderate in severity. There were no deaths or serious AEs. One subject 
had an AE assessed as related to LUM/IVA; one subject discontinued LUM/IVA due to an AE.  
Rash was reported in 3 subjects. All AEs of rash were non-serious and did not require treatment. One 
subject had an AE of rash that led to treatment discontinuation. For all subjects, the AEs of rash 
resolved. 
In part B the majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (24 [52.2%] subjects) or 
moderate (18 [39.1%] subjects) in severity. 2 (4.3%) subjects had severe AEs. No subjects had life-
threatening AEs. There were no deaths. Five (10.9%) subjects had an SAE. Of these 3 were PEx 
reported in CF subjects.  
One (2.2%) subject discontinued LUM/IVA due to an AE; 2 (4.3%) subjects interrupted LUM/IVA due 
to an AE one was a SAE of DIOS assessed as related to study drug.  
In part B: 8.7% of subjects had elevated transaminases: 10.9% of subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 
4.3% subjects had ALT or AST >5 × ULN, and 2.2% subject had ALT or AST >8 × ULN over the 
duration of the study. None of these events was serious, one was severe leading to treatment 
discontinuation. Hepatobiliary adverse reactions including increase of transaminases is already included 
in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 (common ADR).  
2.2% of subjects had dyspnoea that led to treatment interruption. All respiratory adverse reactions 
including dyspnoea are already included in the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.   
One AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increase was reported, this is an ADR common in frequency 
and reported in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report

Mean changes in blood pressure fluctuated over the course of the study, with no clinically meaningful 
changes from baseline. Effect on blood pressure is already reported in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
From study 122 no new safety concerns have been identified for CF subjects 1-2 years old. The safety 
outcomes were generally consistent with the background profile in patients with CF and the established 
safety profile of LUM/IVA, and do not raise any new signals.   
However the safety data exposure in total is small in this age group and the duration of follow-up very 
limited to adequately characterise the safety profile when used in children aged 1-2 years. The safety 
profile is considered sufficiently characterized for marketing authorisation but it is considered 
important to generate further post authorisation efficacy and safety data by extending the PAES to 
address relevant uncertainties. Additional long-term safety data will also be collected in study 124. 
Study 124, a Category 3 PASS, is an open-label extension of Study 122 that includes rollover subjects 
who participated in Study 122 Part B and subjects who did not participate in Study 122 Part B and 
were 12 to <24 months of age at Study 124 Day 1. The objective of this study is to evaluate safety 
and tolerability of long-term LUM/IVA treatment patients aged 12 to <24 months at treatment 
initiation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Available data from study 122 show a consistent positive trend in the amelioration of PD parameters 
(i.e. change from baseline in sweat chloride, FE-1 level, IRT) following Orkambi treatment. This 
extension of indication to very young CF children, aged 1 to 2 years old, is also based on the 
extrapolation of Orkambi efficacy from older children and adults to the younger children enrolled in 
study 122. Therefore the PD parameters are acceptable to assume a similar clinical benefit for younger 
children. The clinical relevance of some parameters may not be fully ascertained in the patient 
population of 1 to 2 years, but it can be agreed that efficacy is being extrapolated from trials in older 
children. However, considering to the limited PD data provided, the lack of clinical data in the children 
aged 1 to 2 years old, and given that the disease is usually less sever in younger children with little 
deterioration in lung function, further data are expected to be generated in the PAES.  
Only a few PK data have been submitted for patients in the 7-9 kg weight brackets, adding some 
uncertainties related to PK variability in this weight group. To confirm the accuracy of the PK model for 
this weight group further PK data will be submitted by the MAH when available. 
The safety profile did not show new safety concerns as compared to the safety profile of LUM/IVA 
coming from CF subjects from other trials and post marketing. Only a small number of children were 
exposed for 24 weeks, thus a complete characterisation of the safety profile of LUM/IVA in this age 
group is not possible at present. Therefore, further safety data with drug exposure longer than 24 
weeks are needed and will be generated in the imposed PAES and in the PASS. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Available data from study 122 show a consistent positive trend in the amelioration of PD parameters 
(i.e. change from baseline in sweat chloride, FE-1 level, IRT) following Orkambi treatment in CF 
children, aged 1 to less than 2 years old. These results give sufficient certainty that extrapolation of 
Orkambi efficacy to this patient population can be applied based on data from older children and 
adults. However taking into consideration uncertainties linked to the uncontrolled study and the small 
number of patients with PD parameters and the lack of clinical efficacy data further clinical study data 
are expected to be generated post authorization with the extension of the PAES to children 1 to 2 
years of age. In addition further long-term safety data will be generated by the PASS planned by the 
MAH. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Orkambi is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
Assessment report  
EMA/222339/2023  
Page 70/73 
 
 
 
 
 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Orkambi is not similar to Kalydeco, TOBI Podhaler, 
Symkevi and Kaftrio within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See 
appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Orkambi 75 mg / 94 mg, granules in sachet is favourable in the 
following indication(s): 
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 1 year and 
older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Orkambi subject 
to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

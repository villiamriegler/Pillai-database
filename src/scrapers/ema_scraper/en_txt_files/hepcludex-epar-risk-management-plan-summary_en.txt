SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR HEPCLUDEX (BULEVIRTIDE) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hepcludex. The RMP details 
important risks of Hepcludex, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Hepcludex’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Hepcludex’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hepcludex should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Hepcludex should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Hepcludex’s RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What is it Used for 
Hepcludex is authorised for chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) – (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains bulevirtide as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Hepcludex’s benefits can be found in Hepcludex’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Hepcludex 
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Hepcludex, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Hepcludex’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Hepcludex is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Hepcludex are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Hepcludex. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B. 
Summary of Important Risks 
Hepcludex has been assigned the legal status of a medicine subject to medical prescription in the 
European Union (EU), whereby therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the 
management of hepatitis D virus infection (as described in section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Summary of Important Risk(s) and Missing Information 
Important Identified 
Risk 
Hepatitis exacerbation after drug discontinuation 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Pronounced reactions were reported only in a few participants who had been exposed 
to bulevirtide for 12-24 weeks. The events were observed at the follow-up visits after 
the end of trial treatment and most had no major clinical symptoms or 
decompensation. The reactions to antiviral drug discontinuation are anticipated and are 
routinely noted in other chronic viral diseases, like hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
monoinfection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The exacerbation occurs after cessation of bulevirtide and leads to a slow increase of 
HBV DNA, hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 
to baseline. So far, no dose relatedness or additive factors have been detected.

Purpose of the Study 
GS-US-589-6206 – A 
Registry Study of Treatment 
with Bulevirtide in 
Participants with Chronic 
Hepatitis D Infection 
This current Registry study aims to collect postmarketing data from patients with 
chronic HDV infection who are treated with bulevirtide in countries where it is 
approved to create a unique clinical database to evaluate the safety and long-term 
effects of bulevirtide treatment on clinical progression of liver disease through 
the incidence of liver-related events. 
Primary objective: 
•  To evaluate the long-term effects of bulevirtide treatment on clinical 
progression of liver disease through the incidence of liver-related events in 
participants treated with bulevirtide 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To evaluate the development of cirrhosis in participants treated with 
bulevirtide who were previously noncirrhotic 
•  To evaluate the safety of participants treated with bulevirtide 
 
Short Study Name 
Purpose of the Study 
MYR204 - A Multicenter, 
Open-label, Randomized 
Phase 2b Clinical Study to 
Assess Efficacy and Safety 
of Bulevirtide in 
Combination with Pegylated 
Interferon alfa-2a in Patients 
with Chronic Hepatitis Delta 
Pegylated interferon alfa -2a (PEG-IFN alfa) is approved for treatment of chronic 
HBV infection, which is required for the propagation of HDV, and used to treat 
patients with HDV infection with evidence of some virologic efficacy. A 
combination of bulevirtide with PEG-IFN alfa demonstrated significant 
synergistic effects in previous clinical trials (e.g., MYR203). It is therefore 
warranted to further investigate the combination therapy with the aim of 
improvement of sustained virologic response rates. 
Primary objectives: 
•  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of bulevirtide 
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 2 mg or 10 mg in combination 
with pegylated interferon alfa-2a once weekly relative to 10 mg bulevirtide 
monotherapy in subjects with chronic hepatitis delta (CHD). 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To assess the safety of bulevirtide 
Exploratory objectives: 
•  To investigate the immunogenicity of bulevirtide 
•  To investigate the influence of bulevirtide on quality of life 
•  HBV/HDV genotyping 
•  Resistance testing 
MYR301 – A Multicenter, 
Open-label, Randomized 
Phase 3 Clinical Study to 
Assess Efficacy and Safety 
of Bulevirtide in Patients 
with Chronic Hepatitis Delta 
This study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of bulevirtide 
in patients with CHD. Primary efficacy and safety data will be assessed at Week 
48, when bulevirtide at 2 and 10 mg daily doses will be compared with delayed 
treatment. After Week 48, patients of the delayed treatment arm in this study will 
be switched to bulevirtide at 10 mg daily dose for additional 96 weeks. The total 
duration of treatment period in this Phase 3 study will be 144 weeks. 
Primary objectives: 
•  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of bulevirtide 
administered subcutaneously for 48 weeks at a dose of 2 mg or 10 mg once 
daily for treatment of chronic hepatitis delta in comparison to delayed 
treatment. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To evaluate optimal treatment duration 
•  To assess the safety of bulevirtide 
Exploratory objectives: 
•  To investigate the immunogenicity of bulevirtide 
•  To investigate the influence of bulevirtide on quality of life 
•  HBV/HDV genotyping 
•  Resistance testing

1.  Information on the procedure 
The EU authorities were notified on June 2018 that an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) 
manufacturer (Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical, China) has detected the presence of a previously 
undetected process impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA, also known as dimethylnitrosamine) in 
the valsartan API manufactured at its site in Chuannan. Zhejiang Huahai (ZH) is one of the API 
manufacturers that are supplying valsartan for medicinal products authorised in the EU. 
NDMA is a genotoxic and carcinogenic agent in animals and it is classified as  probably carcinogenic to 
humans (Class 2A carcinogen) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, WHO). ZH 
provided an initial investigation report on the root cause of the presence of NDMA upon request from 
the supervisory authority in Italy (AIFA). This initial investigation report by the manufacturer indicated 
that NDMA is formed at the tetrazole ring-forming step in ZH’s valsartan API manufacturing process, 
(which includes quenching of remaining azide with nitrous acid) and the level of NDMA present may 
depend on the reaction conditions used. 
On 5 July 2018 the EC triggered a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of the above concerns on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
After the referral procedure started, NDMA was also identified in valsartan from some other API 
manufacturers, including Zhejiang Tianyu. In addition, further N-nitroso impurities were identified in 
some valsartan batches and in batches of other sartans. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 2018, the scope of the referral was widened to include 
all sartans with a tetrazole moiety in their molecular structure. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists/blockers (further referred to as “sartans” or “ARBs”) are 
authorised in the EU as a single agent or in combination with other active substances to be 
administered orally. They are acting on the AT1 receptor subtype thus blocking the effect of 
angiotensin-II in the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) cascade. 
The concerned ARBs, which are those containing a tetrazole group in their molecular structure 
authorised in medicinal products in the EU/EEA, are indicated for the treatment of arterial hypertension 
and for the treatment and prevention of a broad range of cardiovascular diseases. All of these 
indications concern severe and possibly debilitating diseases. The procedure includes all medicinal 
products containing candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan and valsartan (see figure 1 below).

group circled in red at the example of losartan)

Approved indications include the following areas:  
•  Candesartan: Hypertension; heart failure in patients with decreased LV function if ACE inhibitors 
are not tolerated or Add on to ACE inhibitors if mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists are not 
tolerated. 
• 
• 
Irbesartan: Hypertension; treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 
2 diabetes as part of the antihypertensive therapy. 
Losartan: Hypertension; treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 
diabetes as part of the antihypertensive therapy; chronic heart failure; reduction of strokes in adult 
patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. 
•  Olmesartan: Hypertension.  
•  Valsartan: Hypertension; treatment of symptomatic heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction; heart failure. 
Indications and/or dose recommendations for the treatment of arterial hypertension in the paediatric 
population are approved for candesartan, losartan, olmesartan, and valsartan. 
Fixed dose combination products containing the above mentioned Angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists 
are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. All of these ARBs are in wide spread clinical use in the 
EU. 
There are additional ARBs not containing a tetrazole group authorises in the EU, and hence these are 
not subject to this procedure: 
•  Azilsartan 
• 
• 
Eprosartan 
Telmisartan 
For these ARBs no paediatric indications or dose recommendations have currently been approved. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Identification of root causes 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 4/41 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, the formation of N-nitrosamines is only possible in the presence of a secondary or tertiary 
amine and nitrite, usually under acidic reaction conditions. Additionally, the presence of impurities that 
can’t be formed as part of the process, based on the conditions used, can be explained to an extent by 
cross-contamination and/or the use of recovered solvents or equipment contaminated with N-
nitrosamines formed outside of the declared synthetic process. 
NDMA  
For the formation of NDMA, the presence of the secondary amine dimethylamine (DMA) is important. A 
possible route to the formation of DMA is the decomposition of dimethylformamide (DMF) at high 
temperature to DMA (see Fig. 2).  
Fig.: 2 Formation of NDMA from DMF  
An alternative possibility is that DMA is present as an impurity in DMF since it is a precursor in the 
industrial DMF synthetic process. It may also be a degradant formed during storage of the solvent, 
potentially present as the formate salt.  
NDEA: 
NDEA may be generated from diethylamine (DEA) by analogy to the formation of NDMA from DMA (Fig 
above). 
Fig.: 3 General reaction scheme for formation of NDEA from diethylamine  
Analogous to DMA formation, DEA could be formed by degradation of triethylamine (TEA) or exist as 
impurity in TEA raw material. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 5/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alternatively, direct nitrosation of TEA may occur via a nitrosoiminium ion, resulting in the generation 
of an aldehyde and a secondary amine,1 which reacts with further nitrous acid to form a nitrosamine 
(Fig. 4). 
Fig. 4: Nitrosative cleavage of TEA to DEA followed by nitrosation to NDEA 
External sources of contamination: 
It is also possible, and has been found during this procedure, that recycled solvents containing NDEA 
or NDMA are a source of cross-contamination. If solvents used in a reaction step involving azide are 
recovered and re-used, there is the possibility that N-nitrosamines could be inadvertently introduced 
into the manufacturing process if the waste stream is quenched with nitrite in the presence of 
secondary or tertiary amines. Solvent recovery is not part of the declared manufacturing process and 
such risks are therefore not generally assessed by the authorities. Solvent recovery should be carried 
out according to GMP which requires that recovered solvents meet appropriate standards.  
There is a possibility that recycled solvents could be used across manufacturing lines and could result 
in cross-contamination with N-nitrosamines in APIs made by synthetic processes where the synthetic 
route is not susceptible to the formation of nitrosamines. 
There have also been suggestions that process water used in API manufacture could contain low levels 
of nitrosamines from environmental contamination. 
Root cause analysis 
Companies whose APIs were contaminated with NDMA or NDEA were requested to provide a thorough 
root cause analysis during the procedure. Whilst it seems clear that the root cause of the problem is 
the combination of secondary (or tertiary) amines and NaNO2, usually in the presence of acid, the 
source of the secondary amine is crucial to any mitigation strategy. Therefore, experimental data or a 
risk assessment from companies was crucial to determine the source of the secondary amine. 
Furthermore, companies were requested to identify additional process parameters which are implicated 
in N-nitrosamine formation (e.g. temperature, stoichiometry, reaction times, work up procedure, etc.).

Several route causes have been proposed as discussed above. However the source of N-nitrosamine 
could be either down to one root cause, or a combination of several, which could also help explain 
overall variability in contamination. In general, based on the responses received during this referral 
procedure information on root causes in cases of contamination is still limited. 
Other nitrosamines than NDMA or NDEA 
Potential contamination with other N-nitrosamines was considered during this procedure. Such 
impurities could be generated if different sources of secondary or tertiary amine are present at the 
same time as nitrite. Some common organic solvents (e.g. NMP which could give rise to 4-
(methyl)(nitroso)amino)butanoic acid = NMBA) and amine bases (e.g. diisopropylamine = DIPEA which 
could give rise to N-Nitrosodiisopropylamine (DIPNA) and N-Nitrosoethylisopropylamine (EIPNA)) 
would present such risks. This list of amine-derived solvents and bases is not exhaustive. Therefore, 
manufacturers and MAHs must take other potential sources of N-nitrosamines into account when 
reviewing their processes and developing appropriate control strategies.

4-(methyl)(nitroso)amino)butanoic acid (NMBA) 
One API manufacturer reported that a further N-nitroso impurity (non mutagenic in Ames test; see 
also non-clinical section) can be formed in the manufacturing process of valsartan , and it is currently 
controlled as an "unspecified" impurity at <0.10% (1000 ppm).

Following the detection of N-Nitrosamines in valsartan, and subsequently in other sartans with a 
tetrazole ring EDQM initiated a review of all relevant CEPs in order to identify manufacturing processes 
at risk of generating N-nitrosamines and suspended CEPs as appropriate during their review. 
Based on the reviews of responses from API manufacturers and assessments of current CEPs by EDQM 
in relation to N-nitrosamine impurities the CHMP noted that the following CEPs are suspended (as of 31 
January 2019):

OMCL Network results 
During the procedure, the CHMP liaised with the European network of Official Medicines Control 
Laboratories (OMCLs) that is coordinated by European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and 
Healthcare (EDQM) to conduct a risk-oriented sampling and testing programme of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients and/or finished products and to inform the European network about any 
non-compliant results. 
The OMCL Network has developed methods for the testing of specific nitrosamines in sartans on the 
basis of different analytical principles. – The latest information on these methods can be accessed on 
the EDQM-Homepage (https://www.edqm.eu/en/ad-hoc-projects-omcl-network). 
At the time of this report, the Irish OMCL in the Public Analyst’s Laboratory in Galway (PALG), the 
French OMCL at the ANSM site in Montpellier and the Chemisches und Veterinär-Untersuchungsamt 
(CVUA) Karlsruhe as well as the LGL Bayern established analytical methods for quantification of NDMA 
and NDEA on behalf of the Network. Additionally, the U.S. FDA, the Taiwan FDA, Health Canada and 
Swissmedic have published methods for the simultaneous determination of NDMA and NDEA2. 
In view of the results from OMCLs, the CHMP noted that comparisons of valsartan API and related 
finished products (FP)  indicate that in the majority of the cases, FP  contain a lower amount of NDMA 
than in corresponding API batches, although in some cases, the amount was higher in the finished

product (range +10 to -51%). This variability could be explained by a loss of NDMA during formulation, 
non-homogeneous distribution of the impurity, or variability in sampling and analysis.  
In view of co-contamination with both NDMA and NDEA so far in 22 valsartan API batches 
manufactured by ZH NDMA and NDEA have been detected. Mostly, NDEA was low when NDMA was 
high and vice versa. Only in three batches NDEA and NDMA where present in similar amounts between 
4.4 and 10 ppm (see table 1 below).

Data from MAHs and API manufacturers 
Candesartan 
In the responses received from MAHs or API manufacturers of candesartan, no levels of the NDMA and 
NDEA impurities above the acceptable intake (AI) levels, i.e. daily intake levels  calculated based on 
ICH M7(R1) (see non-clinical section below), have been noted. The level of information is variable, 
where some MAHs give a clear description of the syntheses used, the risk assessments as adopted by 
the MAH and information on batch analyses and information on the method validation. However, many 
MAHs did not provide their own risk assessment but included information from the FP manufacturer 
and/or API manufacturer. 
More than half of MAHs have confirmed that the synthesis route includes steps that may potentially 
lead to the generation of N-nitrosamines.  
Generally, none of the batch analyses that have been reported by companies during the procedure 
showed levels of NDMA or NDEA above the thresholds (all not detected, although the limit of detection 
(LoD) differs between methods used). All results come from analyses of the drug substance, apart 
from one batch analysis on finished product. Whilst, many of the methods used for analysis were not 
fully validated, results can be seen as an indication that these impurities are not likely to carry over to 
the drug substance. This is in line with the knowledge that the tetrazole ring-forming step of the 
synthesis of candesartan often is introduced early in the synthesis, thus giving opportunity for removal 
of NDMA and NDEA in subsequent purification steps. 
Irbesartan 
In the responses received from API manufacturers and MAHs, relevant differences are observed 
regarding the information provided. Some of them submitted the complete route of synthesis and 
others only provided a statement confirming the absence of N-nitroso impurities.  
Most of the API manufacturers declare that N-nitroso impurities are not potentially present in the final 
API since the values found are below the safety limit or even not detected. However, taking into 
account the routes of synthesis, NDEA is a potential impurity in many of them and the presented 
limited data does not preclude the need to establish an adequate control strategy. 
None of the API manufacturers has made reference to the possible presence of these impurities in the 
final API due to the use of recovered solvents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 9/41 
 
 
 
 
 
API sourced from Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. is the only API with NDEA  levels found to be higher than the 
AI levels calculated based on ICH M7(R1) (see non-clinical section below). The API manufacturer has 
provided a detailed discussion about the unlikely formation of N-nitrosamine impurities for an 
optimized process and results on the content of NDEA and NDMA in API, intermediate and starting 
materials. The suitability of this optimized process is currently being assessed by EDQM. 
No analytical data of N-nitroso impurities from finished product batches has been submitted. 
Losartan 
Although batch analysis data submitted by MAHs and API manufacturers showed that NDMA or NDEA 
has not been detected in losartan drug substance batches above the limits based on ICH M7 (R1) (see 
non-clinical section below), contamination of Losartan is generally possible. The CHMP noted that two 
losartan CEPs have been suspended (see above) based on the EDQM’s CEP assessment, and OMCL 
testing found NDEA in finished product samples close to the above limits.  
In addition, 4-(methyl)(nitroso)amino)butanoic acid (BMSA/NMBA) has been reported during the 
procedure as a potential impurity in losartan from one MAH and actually detected in losartan batches 
of Hetero Labs (see non-clinical section below on toxicology aspects). NMBA could be formed during 
the synthesis of losartan while using sodium nitrite and N-methylpyrrolidone.  
Olmesartan 
In general, only theoretical discussion of the potential formation of N-nitroso-compounds (mainly 
NDMA and NDEA) has been performed by several MAHs and API manufacturers.  
In about 50% of the responses, the assumption that NDMA and NDEA cannot be formed is supported 
by batch data (API testing only). In some cases, method validation data are missing. Additional 
validation data for GC-MS determination of NDMA and NDEA in API have however been provided late 
by one API manufacturer. 
Batch results from API testing are in-line with the OMCL API/finished product testing (NDMA and NDEA 
have not been found in olmesartan API/FP so far). 
Valsartan 
Answers received from API Manufacturers and MAHs in general do not allow definite conclusions. 
In order to achieve a reliable comparison of analytical data on N-nitrosamines detection, API 
manufacturers and MAHs were asked to preferably use one of the three analytical methods used by 
OMCLs and published on 21 September 2018 (https://www.edqm.eu/en/news/omcls-release-three-
methods-determination-ndma-sartans).  
-The PALG method is based on Headspace-GC-MS (single quad) and applicable to the determination of 
NDMA in API and corresponding FPs of the sartan group. 
-The ANSM method uses HPLC-UV as general analytical principle for the determination of NDMA in 
valsartan (API and FP). 
-The CVUA Karlsruhe method is based on APCI-UHPLC-MS/MS and applicable to the detection and 
quantitative determination of NDMA in valsartan finished products.

In view of analytical data, out of 34 MAHs who answered, 11 MAHs provided analytical data on the 
content of NDMA in their FPs and 5 MAHs in API used in their FPs.  
All MAHs but one were able to provide data on NDEA amount in finished product and the corresponding 
API, while two other MAHs provided data on NDEA in API only. The limited number of data on NDEA in 
valsartan was due to the unavailability of validated analytical methods. 
The highest mean value of NDMA found in finished products (using API by ZH) was 75.4 ppm; this was 
used to calculate the excess risk. The highest mean value of NDMA was found by an MAH in ZH API 
(61.3 ppm). 
Four MAHs tested the presence of NDMA in both API and corresponding FPs. Unfortunately, the lack of 
a robust correlation (potential carry-over – see below) hampers the possibility to perform a sound risk 
assessment. 
Four out of 14 valsartan API manufacturers which answered to the LoQs, provided analytical data on 
the content of NDMA in their APIs; the highest mean value was found by ZH; being  60.13 ppm.  
Two API manufacturers also provided analytical data on NDEA. The highest mean value was 11.53 ppm 
– this was used to calculate the excess risk. 
Some API manufacturers only declared that the process does not involve the use of sodium nitrite, 
claiming that the process could not lead to  formation of NDMA & NDEA in drug substance. This 
statement was only in few cases supported by batch analysis results on N-nitrosamine content 
confirming these claims, in an adequate number of batches. 
Some others provided a flowchart of the manufacturing process starting from an advanced 
intermediate. In general, only limited information has been provided by the API manufacturers to fully 
assess possible contamination. A detailed description of the relevant process steps including quenching 
of sodium azide, work-up, phase separation and extraction procedures as well as information on waste 
streams would be needed to rule out possible N-nitrosamines formation. Any further possible 
contamination coming from raw materials should be investigated, e.g. recycled solvents or reagents, 
possible contamination of NDMA and NDEA in the water or possible presence of nitrite in sodium azide. 
The CHMP also noted that information on adequate purge of azide (which is itself highly reactive and a 
human mutagen) and batch data demonstrating its absence in the API or specification limits  have not 
been consistently presented as part of the responses. The CHMP recommends that MAHs should take 
the above into account when reviewing the manufacturing process. 
It is noted that only some API manufacturers discussed the possible formation and mutagenicity of 
other N-nitrosamines, further than NDMA and NDEA. 
Potential carry-over of impurities from API to finished product has been studied considering MAH 
results as well as OMCL findings. Different trends were observed, with most of the analyses showing 
lower NDMA amounts in the finished product batch than in the corresponding API batch and some 
showing higher amounts in the finished product batch compared with the corresponding API batch.  
Co-presence of NDMA and NDEA above the lowest LoD (0.025 ppm for NDEA) was observed in  22 out 
of 119 valsartan API batches produced by ZH from 2012 to 2016 using the "new" ZnCl2 process. In the 
majority (n. 15) of the compared batches, NDMA was higher than NDEA. In the batch where NDMA 
was highest (59 ppm), NDEA was very low (0.71 ppm); in the batch where NDEA was highest (30.76 
ppm), NDMA was very low (0.22 ppm). Only in three valsartan ZH API batches the ratio between NDEA 
and NDMA was approx 1:1 (10.0ppm NDMA and 9.15ppm NDEA; 9.2ppm NDMA and 8.05ppm NDEA 
and 4.4ppm NDMA and 4.74ppm NDEA).

Additional N-nitrosamines 
DIPNA and EIPNA 
In a previously used synthetic route of one manufacturer, N,N-diisopropylethyl-N-ethylamine (DIPEA) 
was used as a base for intermediate compounds in the manufacturing process for valsartan. This 
synthetic route is not in-use anymore since 2014. The use of DIPEA could potentially lead to the 
formation of two N-nitrosamines namely N-nitrosodiisopropylamine (DIPNA) or N-
nitrosoethylisopropylamine (EIPNA). 
Six valsartan API batches from 2015 (retained samples) have been tested by the manufacturer, in 
which DIPNA and EIPNA were < 0.1 ppm; analytical test of DIPNA and EIPNA in valsartan FPs are not 
available yet. 
Another valsartan manufacturer is also using DIPEA in its manufacturing process. Although the 
manufacturer states that the possibility of N-Nitroso compounds i.e. N-Nitroso-diisopropylamine 
(DIPNA or NDIPA or NDIA) and N-Nitroso-isopropylethylamine (EIPNA or NEIPA or NEIA) is unlikely in 
the manufacturing process followed for an intermediate, it is noted that DIPEA is used for the 
manufacturing of this intermediate. Therefore, the formation of DIPNA and EIPNA cannot be ruled out. 
Ten valsartan API batches from a manufacturer have been tested with a validated GC-MS for the 
simultaneous detection of NDMA, NDEA, NDIPA and NIPEA. LoQ and LoD are set at 0.03 ppm and 0.01 
ppm, respectively for all the four impurities. In all tested valsartan batches, the content of the four 
impurities was below 0.01 ppm. 
Discussion and conclusion on quality aspects 
The CHMP considered all the available information and despite limitations of the information e.g. on 
many manufacturing processes, validation of analytical methods, etc., it is unlikely that further 
relevant information could be expected that would alter the risk assessment and the overall 
recommendation for controlling N-Nitrosamine contaminations prospectively.  
From the root cause analysis, several sources for contamination with N-nitrosamines were identified:  
- 
- 
- 
formation of N-nitrosamines due to the simultaneous presence of a secondary or tertiary amine 
and nitrite, usually under acidic reaction conditions  
cross-contamination 
use of recovered and contaminated solvents, reagents or equipment 
Therefore and having considered all available data and the Quality Working Party’s (QWPs) 
conclusions, the CHMP recommends that the following measures should be taken into account, as 
appropriate, for minimising the risk of all N-nitrosamine contamination: 
•  As main priority, use reaction conditions where the possibility of N-nitrosamine contamination 
is avoided. This could involve using different solvents (i.e. not amides such as DMF, DMA, 
NMP), different bases without secondary/tertiary amines (e.g. inorganic bases), or more 
hindered and thus less reactive amine bases. 
•  Change the order of reactions, introducing the tetrazole moiety at an earlier step – this gives 
more opportunity for purge of N-nitrosamines through subsequent synthesis steps and 
purification operations. Steps involving mutagens should be carried out as early as possible in 
the synthetic sequence.

•  Off-line quenching of azide, following separation of aqueous and organic layers. The repartition 
of azide between aqueous and organic phases and the residual quantities following washing in 
the product layer needs to be characterised; 
•  Replacement of NaNO2 with alternative quenching agents (for azide destruction);  
• 
The use of recovered solvents from steps where there is a risk of N-nitrosamine formation 
(either as part of the API process or as part of the recovery process) should be avoided, or it 
should be demonstrated that N-nitrosamines are adequately purged (i.e. they should be limited 
by specification). This applies particularly to the final step; 
•  Control of raw materials that may introduce nitrite (NO2
-) or N-nitrosamines, e.g. sodium 
azide, solvents and water; 
Overall, it is concluded that N-nitrosamines in finished products can be effectively controlled by using a 
synthesis pathway minimising as much as possible formation of these impurities and observing GMP 
requirements (cleaning of equipment; control of recovery process for solvents, etc.). 
In terms of carryover of N-nitrosamine impurities from active substance to finished product, a 1:1 
correlation could be assumed as “worst case” scenario for both NDMA and NDEA since there are no 
reasons to expect an increase in N-nitrosamine impurities from API to finished product. 
The CHMP considers that the use of AI limits calculated based on ICH M7(R1) (see non-clinical section 
below) are acceptable as specification limits of API for a transitional period (of two years) during which 
risk assessments and, if necessary, changes in manufacturing processes should be performed to 
minimise as much as possible N-nitrosamines presence and to avoid drug shortages. 
After that, limits for NDMA and NDEA lower than the AI levels and defined based on technical feasibility 
of analytical methods should be in place. Preferably, a reference method should be developed and 
validated by cooperative inter-laboratory testing and comparison of results. This procedure should be 
coordinated by EDQM and the results finally published in the European Pharmacopoeia. After the 
transition period, manufacturers will need to show nitrosamine levels in their API to be non-
quantifiable in a sensitive and validated assay. A specification limit should be set based on technical 
capability, which should preferably be derived from the LoQ of a suitably sensitive analytical method, 
which is also in line with the QWP feedback (see below). The underlying concept is that – for long-term 
exposure - NDMA and NDEA levels should be as low as possible in any sartan API without regard to 
type of sartan or dose.  A limit of 0.03 ppm appears achievable according to the data from the OMCL 
network (see OMCL section above). Therefore, the transition period should also be used by 
manufacturers to adapt their analytical methods such that they are sensitive enough to measure levels 
commensurate with the future API specifications for NDMA and NDEA. 
When comparing data on API and finished product provided by OMCLs and MAHs, NDMA concentrations 
– although largely fluctuating - were in generally lower in finished product batches compared to 
corresponding API batches. No conclusion is possible regarding the potential carry-over for NDEA due 
to the limited data provided. 
Overall, a 1:1 correlation could be assumed as “worst case” scenario for both NDMA and NDEA since 
there are no reasons to expect an increase of process impurities from API to finished product. 
In view of co-presence of NDMA and NDEA, as reported by ZH, mostly, NDEA was low when NDMA was 
high and vice versa. Only in three batches NDEA and NDMA where present in similar amounts between 
4.4 and 10 ppm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 13/41 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the CHMP considers that the formation of valsartan N-nitrosamine impurity (Fig.4) further 
demonstrates that if a secondary amine is present and a combination of NaNO2/acid are used, then N-
nitrosamines will generally be formed. 
As concerns the control strategy, only a few MAHs propose to include NDMA/NDEA specification and 
analytical testing for finished medicinal products. Most of the MAHs propose that the NDMA/NDEA 
control should be included at the level of the API itself. 
Overall considerations 
In view of analytical aspects, the available methods differ in their LoD and LoQ, however currently, a 
LoQ of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA would be achievable according to the data from the OMCL 
network (as outlined in the OMCL section above). QWP also supported that any technical limit should 
be based on the LoQ, which would be used to derive a threshold (see section on expert consultation 
below). In comparison to the AI levels calculated based on ICH M7(R1) (see section 2.3 non-clinical 
aspects below for details), it is possible to generate additional safety factors ranging from 2.73 – 27.3 
for NDMA and 10.0 – 100 for NDEA, respectively, by defining 0.03 ppm as the common technical target 
limit for NDEA and NDMA in tetrazole sartan APIs (see table 2 below).

The underlying concept of the proposed approach is to keep NDMA and NDEA contaminations as low as 
technically possible, without regard to type of sartan or dose. 
The approach to control the nitrosamines at API level proposed by some MAHs is endorsed considering 
that they are process impurities. The approach to control the impurities both by acting on the synthetic 
process to reduce/remove the impurities as much as possible and by in the meantime setting adequate 
specifications at API level, is also endorsed. The above considerations for root causes should be taken 
into consideration when reviewing the manufacturing process in order to reach the final target of 0.03 
ppm for NDMA and NDEA.

Based on the considerations above, the risk of N-Nitrosamine contamination is in principle possible 
across the class of sartans with a tetrazole ring, and thus, measures to control contamination risk 
should be applicable for all of the corresponding products. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
NDMA and NDEA Toxicology 
NDMA is metabolized primarily by CYP2E1 in liver of rodents finally leading to the generation of a 
methyldiazonium ion (Sulc et al., 2010) (Fig. 7) which can react with DNA and predominantly forms N7 
and O6-methylguanine (N7MG and O6MG), the latter being highly mutagenic. Error-free repair of O6MG 
is done by O6-Methylguanin-DNA-Methyltransferase (MGMT), a suicide enzyme with limited capacity in 
cells. O6MG and to a lesser extend N7MG are relevant mutagenic lesions which have been shown to 
increase in animals following NDMA exposure. 
Fig.  7:  Metabolic  activation  of  NDMA  formation  of  the  DNA-reactive  methyldiazoniumion 
from NDMA (adapted from Sulc et al., 2010) 
NDEA is metabolized in humans primarily by CYP2E1 and CYP2A6. The metabolism is considered 
similar to NDMA with the primary activation step by α-hydroxylation to α-hydroxyl-NDEA and finally 
leading to an ethyldiazonium ion reacting with DNA and formation of O4-ethyldeoxythymidine (O4ET) 
and O6 ethylguanin (O6EG) as the primary mutagenic adducts (Verna et al. 1996). In liver of male 
fisher rats O6EG and O4ET increased dose dependently with NDEA reaching maximum after 6 h. 
Whereas O6MG diminished after 24h, O4ET and the minor adduct O2ET were persistent even after 20 
days. This may be due to the difference in repair mechanism. While alkyltransferase (AT) effectively 
repairs O6EG, O4ET repair seems to be much slower and less effective (Pegg et al. 1984, Dragan et al. 
1994). 
NDMA and NDEA cause increases in mutations in different organs in mouse (Jiao et al., 1997, Chen et 
al. 1993) and NDMA and NDEA cause cancer in various species and different organs of laboratory 
Assessment report

animals with liver being a primary target organ in all species (The Carcinogenic Potency Database, 
CPDB - online). The carcinogenicity studies in rats from Peto et al., (1991) are considered the most 
extensive and most relevant studies to be used for human risk assessment. 
With regards to human data, there are publications on acute toxicity and on endogenous formation of 
NDMA and NDEA (Hu et al 2016). Some epidemiological studies have used estimations of exogenous 
NDMA exposure and in one case also NDEA exposure derived from food intake questionnaires. These 
have suggested an association between exposure and development of cancer (mainly stomach, rectal 
and pancreatic cancer) in humans (Knekt et al., 1999, Loh et al., 2011, Song et al. 2015, Zheng et al, 
2018). The weakness of such studies however is that only the NDMA content was estimated whereas 
the contents of other carcinogens that may be present in food, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs), were not. PAHs and other carcinogens are usually present in higher concentrations than 
volatile N-nitrosamines. Therefore, interpretation of these studies remains questionable. 
As happening in a real life context, intake of NDMA and NDEA should be seen in relation to the overall 
intake of carcinogens, e.g. as benzo[a]pyrene and other PAHs and also other nitrosamines that are 
present in common food sources, such as grilled meat. Exogenous intake of NDMA and NDEA is 
however considered to be lower than intake of some other carcinogens. The amount of NDMA and 
NDEA coming from endogenous sources through conversion of amines to NDMA and NDEA in gastric 
and other acid tissue environments is described to be higher than general exogenous exposure (Krul et 
al. 2004; Zeilmaker et al., 2010; Zeng and Mitch, 2016, Hu et al. 2016). In this respect, endogenous 
NDMA and NDEA generation can depend on specific patient characteristics, e.g. higher NDMA and 
NDEA levels were observed in patients with inflammatory conditions or infections than in healthy 
individuals. Limited data in patients also show that endogenous NDMA and NDEA exposure increases 
with ethanol consumption (Dunn et al., 1990; Verna et al. 1996, Hu et al., 2016; Dunn, 1989). The 
potential impact of patient characteristics, such as metabolic enzyme activity of CYP2E1, CYP2A6 
(Wang et al., 2003), but also CYP3A6 and CYP2B4 (metabolic conversion of this nitrosamine to highly 
reactive species), individual repair capacity of O6MG and O6EG via O6-alkylguanine DNA 
alkyltransferase (Margison et al., 2003), and health status may affect the individual subject’s risk. 
However, it is acknowledged that these data may not be available for patients. There is strong 
evidence that the toxicological effects of NDMA and NDEA depend on metabolic activation by CYP2E1 
and/or CYP2A6 and DNA-repair capacities for the specific DNA-adducts formed, e.g. MGMT-dependent 
repair capacity (Smith et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 1996; Hall et al., 1985). 
Detection of NDMA/NDEA in APIs / finished products 
NDMA and NDEA above the AI levels defined based on the principles of ICH M7(R1) have been found 
retrospectively in valsartan batches manufactured by ZH. NDMA or NDEA above the AI level were also 
found e.g. in valsartan batches manufactured by ZT and Mylan, losartan batches manufactured by 
Hetero Labs and in irbesartan batches manufactured by Aurobindo. For risk assessment, it currently 
seems prudent to perform excess risk calculations using the highest mean amounts found in finished 
products and the levels reported to be found in APIs. 
Exposure to NDMA in contaminated sartan tablets and API batches 
NDMA concentrations in valsartan API batches have been measured retrospectively by the API 
manufacturers, MAHs and by OMCLs of the EDQM network. Published results are also available for a 
few finished product samples taken from pharmacies by Zentrallaboratorium Deutscher Apotheker e.V. 
(DAZ – online 2018). 
The highest number of API batches measured with highest impurity values was manufactured from ZH. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that the tablets with highest measured values of NDMA were 
manufactured using ZH API. To be cautious and using a conservative approach for risk assessment, the 
Assessment report

mean values of the API batches manufactured by ZH are used and also the highest mean of NDMA 
found in the finished products of the MAHs which provided data. The highest mean levels of NDMA 
were found in a finished product using ZH API. 
The highest NDMA mean values found, which are used for further excess risk calculations are 
summarized in the table below:

It is assumed that the amount of NDMA in the drug substance batches is fully (1:1) transferred into 
the respective finished product as outlined in the Quality section above.  
It seems therefore reasonable to continue performing further calculations of excess risk using the data 
of the API batches submitted by ZH and the above data from finished product using ZH API and 
assuming a 1:1 transfer of NDMA from API into finished product. 
Therefore, the situation which CHMP considers as a realistic worst case exposure is highlighted by the 
following main points: 
•  maximum duration of exposure of patients to NDMA contaminated valsartan of 6 years (since 
July 2012 to July 2018). 
•  240.1 ppm as the highest NDMA contamination found in ZH API batches, as communicated by 
ZH. This would result in 76.8 µg/day in a 320 mg valsartan tablet. 
•  60.13 ppm as the mean NDMA contamination found in ZH API batches. This would result in 
19.24 µg/day in a 320 mg valsartan tablet. 
•  75.4 ppm as the highest mean NDMA contamination found by one MAH in valsartan tablets 
manufactured using ZH API, corresponding to 24.1 µg/day in a 320 mg valsartan tablet. 24.1 
µg is used as the maximum average daily exposure of patients in further excess risk 
calculations. This value is the highest mean measured in tablets so far and still close to the 
average measured in ZH API batches. 
The average daily exposure to NDMA due to contaminated beverages and food, air and water pollution 
is assumed as within an order of magnitude 100 – 1,000 ng/day = 0.1 – 1 µg/day (Keszei et al. 2013; 
N-NITROSODIMETHYLAMINE. WHO. Geneva, 2002). Thus, NDMA exposure associated with 
contaminated valsartan tablets (containing API from ZH) containing the mean NDMA levels is 
approximately 24 to 240 times higher than the daily exposure through beverages and food, air and 
water pollution. 
Exposure to NDEA in contaminated sartan tablets and API batches 
NDEA concentrations in valsartan API batches have also been measured retrospectively by the API 
manufacturer ZH and by OMCLs of the EDQM network in some API batches and FP. More than two 
months after finding NDMA in API batches of valsartan, ZH informed customers and the authorities of 
having also found NDEA in older batches of valsartan manufactured between 2011 and 2015. ZH 
provided analyses results for NDEA of 201 valsartan batches. Analyses results from finished products

for NDEA contamination are very limited. Only two MAHs provided some data for NDEA in finished 
products as well as API. One of the MAHs used ZH APIs. Swissmedic measured NDEA in API and 
finished product from Mylan at levels >0.083 ppm. Mylan submitted results for 42 API batches (see 
table below); 17 were reported to also contain NDMA below 0.3 ppm. Aurobindo submitted data for 79 
batches irbesartan finished product and 94 batches Irbesartan API. Heterolabs found NDEA in 25 of 
535 losartan batches analysed. Only four were above 0.083 ppm with a maximum of 0.15 ppm. The 
few data available suggest considerable lower NDEA values in finished products compared to 
corresponding API batches. However, there are also few cases with higher NDEA levels in finished 
product than in the API it was made of.

Due to limited data of finished products no conclusions on the transfer rate from API to finished 
product can be drawn. 
For calculations of potential excess cancer risk of NDEA exposure, the mean API contamination levels 
found in ZH API batches with 11.53 ppm equivalent to 3.7 µg/d for 320 mg valsartan tablets is used to 
provide a conservative worst case estimate. For duration of potential exposure 4 years, are assumed to 
be a conservative estimate based on the duration of manufacture of potentially contaminated batches 
by ZH from 2011 - 2015. 
In Irbesartan API of Aurobindo only low levels of NDEA were found in batches manufactured 2016 – 
2018. Considering the low levels and the limited potential exposure period, no excess risk above 1 
additional cancer case among 100,000 subjects exposed a life time is estimated. 
Co-Exposure to NDMA and NDEA 
As outlined in the section on quality above, mostly, NDEA was low when NDMA was high and vice 
versa. Only in three API batches NDEA and NDMA where present in similar amounts between 4.4 and 
10 ppm. 
Data on co-contamination are very limited. The worst case scenario for excess risk calculations is 
therefore still assumed to be batches finished product manufactured using ZH API containing mean

values of 75.4 ppm NDMA (24.1 µg in 320 mg valsartan) and of ZH API with 11.53 ppm NDEA (3.7 
µg). 
Compound acceptable intake (AI) levels 
NDMA is a potent mutagenic carcinogen in a number of different animal species. On the basis of animal 
data (rat being the most sensitive species), NDMA is classified by the IARC as “probably carcinogenic 
to humans” (Class 2A carcinogen). This classification is used by IARC when there is "limited evidence 
of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals". Other 
long-term effects, such as severe hepatotoxicity have also been observed in rhesus monkeys with this 
class of nitrosamines. 
Although NDMA itself does no react with DNA and metabolic activation is needed to form the DNA-
reactive molecule as outlined above, in risk assessment NDMA is however regarded as a DNA reactive 
carcinogen. For such compounds any exposure level is considered to pose a risk and safe level without 
a risk cannot be established. Although this general paradigm is currently challenged, the scientific 
debate has not come to an acceptable conclusion yet. An increased theoretical lifetime cancer risk of 1 
additional case in 100,000 treated patients i.e. increased lifetime cancer risk of 1:100,000, is the 
generally accepted risk level for impurities in pharmaceutical products (ICH M7(R1)). 
NDMA belongs to N-nitroso compounds, which are part of the so-called “cohort of concern” described in 
the ICH guideline M7(R1). For such compounds the generic TTC of 1.5 µg/day as an AI for mutagenic 
impurities is not considered applicable and a compound specific AI needs to be derived from compound 
specific carcinogenicity data. 
The generally accepted approach recommended by ICH M7(R1) is to use either the dose giving a 50% 
tumour incidence (TD50) or the Bench Mark Dose Lower Bound Confidence Limit (BMDL 10), an estimate 
of the lowest dose which is 95% certain to cause no more than a 10% cancer incidence in rodents, as 
the point of departure for the calculation of excess cancer risk. 
A well acknowledged and accepted source for TD50 values from cancer studies is the Carcinogenic 
Potency Database (CPDB; online). 
The TD 50 listed there for NDMA is 0.096 mg/kg/day (in the most sensitive species, the rat) calculated 
as harmonic mean from all positive studies in rats including the data of the Peto et al. 1991 study. The 
extrapolation to the excess risk level for cancer is performed by linear back extrapolation to the dose 
theoretically causing a 1:100,000 risk by dividing the TD50 by 50,000 (50% or 0.5 x 100,000). For 
NDMA this translates into a dose of 1.92 ng/kg/day. For a person with a bodyweight of 50 kg this 
would result in an AI level of 96 ng/day (50 x 1.92 ng). 96 ng/day correspond to 0.3 ppm in a 320 
mg valsartan tablet.

According to the Haber’s rule, a fundamental principle in toxicology generally accepted to be used for 
mutagenic carcinogens and therefore considered appropriate for NDMA, the total dose taken over time 
(dose x time) produces a fixed level of effect, thus, determining the risk associated with the exposure. 
Applying this very conservative principle, the cumulated dose acceptable for lifetime is then the AI 
multiplied by the days of a lifetime (70 years is generally accepted for this) of 25,550 days. Using the 
AI calculated from TD 50 i.e. 96 ng/day results in a lifetime acceptable dose associated with a 
1:100,000 additional cancer risk of 2453 µg. 
As the maximum duration of exposure to NDMA from contaminated valsartan is 6 years or 2190 days 
the AI for 6 years can be calculated by dividing by 2190 resulting in: 1.12 µg/day as AI over 6 years. 
Doubling of this intake doubles the risk from 1:100,000 to 1:50,000 and so on. 
The approach based on TD 50 was first used to determine regulatory action levels (to set an action limit 
for NDMA in new valsartan API) and first excess cancer risk calculations for the realistic worst-case 
exposure scenario as outlined above. This calculations resulted in a theoretical excess lifetime cancer 
risk of 1:5000 (0.02%) for taking daily 320 mg valsartan contaminated with 24.1 µg NDMA (the 
highest amount tested in valsartan FP). 
NDEA, like NDMA, is also classified by IARC as “probably carcinogenic to humans”.   
Several TD 50 values for NDEA are listed in the CPDB for rat, cynomolgus monkey and bush babies. The 
lowest calculated TD 50 is 0.00725 mg/kg/day for liver tumours in the cynomolgus monkey. The TD50 
for NDEA obtained in the rat is 0.0265 mg/kg/day. In rat besides liver tumours also other tumours 
were reported e.g. oesophagus, kidney, and vasculature in male rat. 
The extrapolation to the excess risk level for cancer is then done the same way as for NDMA by linear 
back extrapolation to the dose theoretically causing a 1:100,000 risk by dividing the TD50 by 50.000 
(50% or 0.5 x 100,000). For NDEA this translates into a dose of 0.144 ng/kg/day extrapolated from 
cynomolgus monkeys and 0.53 ng/kg/day extrapolated from rat. For a person with a bodyweight of 50 
kg this would result in an AI level of 7.2 ng/day (50 x 0.144 ng) or 26.5 ng/day (50 x 0.53 ng). 7.2 ng 
is equal to 0.0225 ppm and 26.5 ng is equal to 0.083 ppm in a 320 mg valsartan tablet. 
The difference between TD50 values based on different studies/calculations is considered significant. 
For the NDEA risk assessment it is therefore considered necessary to first assess the most appropriate 
TD 50 to be used as a starting point. 
As outlined above there are at least two different models to calculate excess cancer risk from animal 
studies. Both rely on mathematical models to first fit experimental animal data to calculate a virtual 
continuous dose response curve and set benchmarks (e.g. TD50 and BMDL 10) which are then used to 
extrapolate into a never tested extremely low dose range and calculate theoretical risk levels (e.g. 1 in 
100,000 additional cancer risk) for ultralow doses. It seems clear that variability of doses calculated in 
this way may be significant depending on the quality of animal experiments, number of doses tested in 
the experiment, group size of dose groups in animal tests and extrapolation models. 
The critical evaluation of the animal species data (rat or cynomolgus monkey) to use for the NDEA 
excess risk calculation highlights the strength and limitations of the rat and monkey datasets. Although 
it cannot be excluded that the non-human primates may be a more relevant model, the huge dataset 
for rat with 14 studies with up to 15 doses tested would provide a much more robust and accurate 
calculation of the dose response curve. Furthermore, the monkeys were dosed i.p. whereas the rat 
were dosed orally. In the most sensitive study in cynomolgus monkeys a huge interval of more than 
300 µg/day was chosen between the lowest dose and the second dose. The second dose already 
caused cancer in all of the only 3 animals in that group. The group size of all intermediate dosage 
groups was small with only 3 to 7 animals per group. The most extensive rat study used 9 ascending

doses in the same dose range and 60 animals per group. Only 2 studies in cynomolgus monkeys are 
available with the second study only using one dose compared to 8 studies in total for the rat (5 with 
more than one dose group). A summary of the study outlines is given below. It was therefore 
concluded that the TD 50 calculated for the cynomolgus monkey studies is most likely more unreliable 
compared to the TD 50 calculated for the rat studies.

The rat TD 50 results in an AI level of 26.5 ng/day, equal to 0.083 ppm in a 320 mg valsartan tablet, 
associated with an excess lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 100,000 as indicated in the table below.

Cumulative excess cancer risk on co-exposure to NDMA and NDEA 
Both compounds are assumed to be toxic mainly by the mutagenic action of highly reactive 
metabolites which alkylate DNA and form highly mutagenic DNA-adducts. It is assumed that DNA 
adducts add up in linear kinetics. 
Adduct formation follows a linear kinetic and the risk is also considered to be additive. Cumulative risk 
can then be calculated by adding up the calculated single compound risk values. A potential worst case 
scenario would be an exposure to NDEA for 4 years (2011 – 2015) and NDMA exposure for 6 years 
(2012 – 2018). The cumulative theoretical excess risk would then be 29.5:100,000 or 1:3390 or 
0.029%. This is equivalent to what was suggested in the SWP response to the CHMP List of Questions 
(see expert consultation section below) with using toxic equivalency by assigning toxic equivalency 
factors to the single compounds in a mixture. 
Further considerations on alternative methods for calculation of theoretical excess cancer 
risk (BMDL 10) 
Dose response curves of cancer studies are usually not linear but sub linear; this is also the case for 
the studies with NDMA. The TD 50 is the well accepted conservative starting point recommended by ICH 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 22/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
M7(R1) for the calculation of the acceptable excess risk to calculate AIs for mutagenic and carcinogenic 
impurities and it is a well-recognized international standard. 
However, this method is considered conservative and therefore may overestimate the real risk and not 
be the most appropriate one for realistic excess risk calculations. The BMDL 10 is considered a more 
realistic risk estimation, however, it still lacks an international harmonized calculation methodology and 
was therefore not considered suitable to calculate AIs. 
The BMDL 10 is however discussed below using NDMA data for comparison: 
The BMDL 10 represents an estimate of the lowest dose, which is 95% certain to cause no more than a 
10% cancer incidence in rodents, as the point of departure for the calculation of excess cancer risk. 
The BMDL 10 is considered to represent a more realistic point of departure for risk estimations in low 
exposure scenarios, than a TD 50 value. 
Using the BMDL 10 for calculation of excess cancer risk is also outlined in ICH M7(R1) and this approach 
was the recommended approach in the expert consultation (see section 4). 
Published BMDL 10 values for NDMA calculated for total liver tumours in male rats using data from Peto 
et al. (1991), either the complete data set or only part of it, and data from different sources, results in 
a range from 0.029 mg/kg/day (Zeilmaker et al., 2010, PROAST 17.9) to 0.062 mg/kg/day (Herrmann 
et al., 2015). A calculation with a recent version (version 65.2) of the PROAST (RIVM 2018) software 
developed by the RIVM resulted in a BMDL10 of 0.043 mg/kg/day for all liver tumours. 
BMDL 10 value of 0.062 mg/kg/day is based on liver cell tumours incidence as marker and therefore not 
completely comparable with the 0.029 mg/kg/day derived from total liver tumours. Therefore, the 
BMDL 10 of 0.043 mg/kg/day is used as the more comparable upper level of the BMDL10 range. 
Calculation of the theoretical excess risk of 1:100,000 is then done by dividing the BMDL10 by 10,000 
(10% or 0.1 x 100,000). Using 0.029 mg/kg/day as the lower and 0.043 mg/kg/day as the upper 
levels of the range, this results in a range of 2.9 to 4.3 ng/kg/day. For a 50 kg person this would be: 
145 ng/day – 215 ng/day corresponding to 0.45 – 0.67 ppm in a 320 mg valsartan tablet. 
According to the Haber’s rule, using the BMDL10 range from above (i.e.: 145 ng/day – 215 ng/day) this 
results in a lifetime acceptable dose associated with a 1:100,000 additional cancer risk of 3705 µg – 
5439 µg. Dividing by 2190 results in 1.7 µg/day – 2.5 µg/day as AI over 6 years. 
This calculation resulted in a theoretical excess lifetime cancer risk in the range of 9.6 – 14:100,000 
(0.0096% - 0.014%) for taking daily 320 mg valsartan contaminated with 24.1 µg NDMA (the mean 
NDMA value tested in a FP using API from ZH). 
This calculated risk is slightly lower than the 0.02% (1:5000) calculated using the TD50 approach 
demonstrating that measures taken immediately on occurrence of this incident were sufficiently 
protective and also that the TD 50 approach is not overly conservative compared to BMDL 10. 
Calculations for AI levels and excess risk are summarised in the table below.

Assessment of additional nitrosamines other than NDMA and NDEA  
As regards the additional nitrosamine impurities found or which can be potentially formed in valsartan, 
the following is highlighted: 
• 
The valsartan N-nitroso impurity (Fig.4) , found only by one MAH in valsartan , is considered a 
non-mutagenic aromatic nitrosamine controlled as "unspecified" impurity at < 1000 ppm in 
valsartan drug substance. Negative results for valsartan N-nitroso impurity at Ames test 
appear reliable although no formal GLP-compliance was declared. Salmonella strains used are 
those indicated in ICH S2 guideline and are adequate to detect base-pair substitution, 
frameshift and cross-linking mutation mechanisms. Although the available evidence does not 
allow clearly concluding on a positive correlation between mutagenicity (Ames test) and 
carcinogenicity of alyphatic or aromatic nitrosoamines, the structural similarity between 
valsartan N-nitroso impurity and valsartan suggests a limited in vivo oxidative metabolism that 
would potentially lead to DNA alkylating impurities also for valsartan N-nitroso impurity. 
• 
Three manufacturers reported that DIPNA (NDIPA, NDIA) and EIPNA (NEIPA. NIEA) can  
potentially be formed ) due to the use of N,N-diisopropylethyl-N-ethylamine (DIPEA), a tertiary 
amine, in the synthesis. For both DIPNA and EIPNA, the daily intake  limit and corresponding 
concentration of NDEA, calculated for the maximum valsartan daily dose authorized in the EU 
(320 mg), should be applied (i.e. 26.5 ng/day and 0.08 ppm, respectively). It is however noted 
that valsartan finished product batches manufactured using intermediates from one 
manufacturer are still within shelf life and are released in EU market. Thus CHMP recommends 
testing API batches contained in these products. using an adequate analytical method able to 
determine the two impurities, and a  “reporting threshold” of 0.08 ppm. Overall, the same 
control approach applied for NDMA and NDEA (i.e. optimisation of synthetic process by 
adoption of strategies to mitigate risk of nitrosamine contamination, for example elimination of 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019

the tertiary amine DIPEA, and specification limits) should also be applied for DIPNA and EIPNA 
in valsartan  
•  4-(methyl)(nitroso)amino)butanoic acid (BMSA/NMBA) has been reported as a potential 
impurity in losartan from one manufacturer and was actually detected in Losartan batches of 
Hetero Labs. It can be formed during the synthesis of losartan while using sodium nitrite and 
N-methylpyrrolidone. For NMBA, a carcinogenicity study in rats is listed in CPDB (Hasegawa et 
al. 1998) with a TD50 of 982 µg/kg/d. This leads to a provisional calculation of an AI of 982 
ng/day for a 50 kg human associated with a 1:100,000 excess lifetime cancer risk. There are 
currently contradictory mutagenicity data in bacteria (Ames negative and positive results in 
different tests). Therefore, it can currently not be concluded whether NMBA  is a mutagenic or 
non-mutagenic carcinogen. As a precaution, NMBA should currently be considered as a 
mutagenic carcinogen like NDMA and NDEA for the time being. However, due to the limitations 
of the available carcinogenicity study and limited other toxicological data, additional data and 
analyses might be needed to define an AI. A precautionary approach like for DIPNA and EIPNA 
is recommended in this situation.  
Conclusion on Non-clinical aspects  
Risk assessment for patients previously exposed to NDMA /NDEA 
As outlined above the calculation of AI levels of mutagenic impurities follows the internationally 
accepted guidance of ICH M7(R1). AIs are considered as those associated with an excess lifetime 
cancer risk of not more than 1:100,000. The starting point of the calculation is the data from lifetime 
carcinogenicity studies in animals. The calculation is based on the conservative assumption of a linear 
dose response relationship for mutagenic carcinogens like NDMA and NDEA. It extrapolates into very 
low exposure levels where it is impossible to measure effects experimentally. It is considered to very 
likely overestimate the real risk and is therefore precautious and conservative with regard to patient 
safety. Using this approach, described in detail above (section 3.3) the calculated theoretical excess 
lifetime cancer risk for patients is shown in the table below:

For patients exposed for 6 years to NDMA-contaminated valsartan assuming a 1:1 transfer of the 
impurity from API to finished product and a mean NDMA content of 24.1 µg in a 320 mg tablet, the 
theoretical excess risk of cancer during lifetime is calculated to be 21.5 in 100,000. This is 
approximately 0.02%. For patients exposed for 4 years to NDEA-contaminated valsartan assuming a 
1:1 transfer of the impurity from API to finished product and a mean NDEA content of 3.7 µg in a 320 
mg tablet, this theoretical excess risk is calculated to be 8 in 100,000 (0.08%). The excess risk in 
patients co-exposed to both NDMA and NDEA for 4 years and NDMA alone for 2 years is calculated to 
be 29.5 in 100,000 or 0.03%.

Compared to the overall risk of cancer during lifetime for the EU population (e.g.in Germany reportedly 
50.3 % in men and 43.5 % in women; in Italy 62% in men and 59% in women) the theoretical 
additional risk due to the highest levels reported of NDMA/NDEA in some valsartan batches is 
considered very low. 
Target organ(s) of NDMA and NDEA in humans are currently unknown. In animal experiments across 
species the primary target organ is liver. Additionally, tumours were observed in oesophagus, kidney, 
vasculature system, gastrointestinal tract and lung with either NDMA and/or NDEA. However, 
extrapolation to potential target organs for carcinogenicity in humans is highly uncertain. This is also 
the conclusion of the SWP. An overview is given in the table below.

The impact of NDMA and NDEA on human health is currently only extrapolated from animal studies. 
However, as the mechanisms outlined above are also present in humans and in vitro data in human 
cells are not significantly different from those in animal cells, it is prudent to assume that effects 
observed in animals could also potentially occur in humans. A full risk assessment for patients exposed 
to NDMA and/or NDEA is not possible as the real extent of exposure of patients is in principle

impossible to establish, as data of finished products used by each individual patient would be 
necessary. 
Provisional interim limits for future batches 
Based on the same TD 50 data in rats outlined above, compound specific AI levels associated with a 
theoretical excess cancer risk of 1:100,000 when exposed daily for life time have been calculated 
according to ICH M7 (R1). The limits are given in the table below together with corresponding ppm 
values in the maximum daily dose of each sartan:

These levels have been used for decision making at Member State level in case of detection of NDMA 
and NDEA during the procedure, and have been referenced by MAHs and API manufacturers in their 
responses when presenting analytical results. The CHMP considered that these limits could be used 
during a transition phase during which companies will have to carefully review, and if warranted, 
change their manufacturing processes to further reduce formation of nitrosamines.  
Other nitrosamines 
DIPNA and EIPNA  
 Since DIPNA and EIPNA share the same toxicological profile of NDEA, the same control approach 
applied for NDMA and NDEA (i.e. optimisation of synthetic process by adoption of strategies to mitigate 
risk of nitrosamine contamination, for example through the elimination of the tertiary amine DIPEA, 
and application of specification limits) should also be applied for DIPNA and EIPNA.

Valsartan N-nitroso impurity With regard to the formation of (S)-2-(((2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-[1,1'-
biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl)(nitroso)amino)-3-methylbutanoic acid reported by one  manufacturer in 
valsartan CHMP agrees that this is a non-mutagenic aromatic nitrosamine and it is acceptable that it is 
controlled as "unspecified" impurity at < 1000 ppm in API. 
NMBA 
With regard to the potential formation of 4-(methyl)(nitroso)amino)butanoic acid (BMSA/NMBA) during 
the synthesis of losartan while using sodium nitrite and N-methylpyrrolidone, an AI  level based on 
animal carcinogenicity data (CPDB) 982 ng/day has been calculated provisionally using the same 
methodology as for NDMA/NDEA. For NMBA, a carcinogenicity study in rats is listed in CPDB 
(Hasegawa et al. 1998) with a TD50 of 982 µg/kg/d. This corresponds to an AI level of 982ng/d. 
There are currently contradictory mutagenicity data in bacteria (AMES negative and positive results in 
different tests). Therefore, it can currently not be concluded whether it is a mutagenic or non-
mutagenic carcinogen. As a precaution, it should currently be considered as a mutagenic carcinogen 
like NDMA and NDEA. Due to the limitations of the available carcinogenicity study and limited 
toxicological data, additional data and analyses might be needed to define an AI. A precautionary 
approach like for DIPNA and EIPNA is recommended in this situation.  
Other potential nitrosamines 
The toxicology assessment of nitrosamines not detailed in this report should follow the same principles 
that have been established for NDMA and NDEA, unless otherwise justified. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
It is important to consider that the target organs of NDMA/NDEA toxicity and cancer may differ 
between species. In rats, used for calculating the theoretical excess risk in humans, the main target 
organ is liver, which is also a target organ in other species. Besides liver, the organs affected vary 
across species. There are currently too limited data on NDMA/NDEA target organs in humans exposed 
chronically to doses of nitrosamines exceeding the occupational exposure. The limited epidemiological 
data available in humans point to an increase in colorectal cancer and in one study a correlation of 
NDMA/NDEA exposure with pancreatic cancer incidence was reported (Knekt et al. 1999, Loh et al. 
2011, Zheng et al. 2018). In those studies, excess exposure to nitrosamines in the range of several 
hundreds of nanograms was associated with increased cancer risks. These data however are derived 
from virtual extrapolation of NDMA and or NDEA exposure calculated via food intake surveys and it is 
questionable whether the findings are really attributable to NDMA or NDEA. Parenteral exposure of 
monkeys to NDMA leads to severe liver toxicity and parenteral and oral exposure to NDEA leads to liver 
tumours; however, valid data for target organ(s) of oral NDMA or NDEA exposure of humans are not 
available.  
A first EU cohort study in patients potentially exposed to NDMA contaminated valsartan was performed 
in Denmark by Pottegard et al. (2018). The study did not identify an increase in total cancer cases in 
NDMA-exposed patients (hazard ratio for overall cancer was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 
1.41). For single cancer outcomes, increases in risk were observed for colorectal cancer (hazard ratio 
1.46, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 2.73) and for uterine cancer (1.81, 0.55 to 5.90), although with 
wide confidence intervals that included the null. The wide confidence intervals suggest that the study 
population was too small (final cohort: N= 5150) and/or the observed events too few and therefore no 
final conclusion can be drawn on whether the observations are a chance finding or represent a real 
Assessment report

effect. Although the preliminary study data from this nationwide registry provide some reassurance, 
the mean follow up period in that study is only 4.6 years and therefore far too short to assess alifetime 
cancer risks. Continuous periodical surveillance of patients in such registry-based studies may 
potentially be helpful to provide further evidence for the absence or presence of any long term effect. 
The study by Pottegard et al. (2018) has focused on NDMA contaminated valsartan and did not focus 
on patients potentially co-exposed to NDMA and NDEA.  
In October 2011, EMA concluded a referral procedure according to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 on Angiotensin II (type-1) receptor antagonists and risk of cancer (EMEA/H/A-5(3)/1274). 
The CHMP concluded in the above referral that the evidence collected at that time from clinical trials 
and epidemiological studies did not support a signal of increased cancer risk associated with ARBs. 
Therefore, it is unlikely that ARBs as such would enhance a nitrosamine-associated cancer risk. 
Currently, it is not possible to conclude on any risk minimization measures exposed patient would 
benefit from. The very small theoretical excess risk calculated based on animal studies has to be 
balanced against the risks of measures to monitor patients such as colonoscopy or gastroscopy that 
may exceed the theoretical excess cancer risk. For example, a recent review has estimated risks of 
perforation of 4 per 10,000 (95% confidence interval, 2-5) and major haemorrhage of 8 per 10,000 
(95% confidence interval, 5-14) with screening colonoscopy (Lin et al. JAMA 2016). In addition, 
advancing age, comorbidity and use of anticoagulants were found to be strongly associated with both 
gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal complications. Furthermore, the target organ(s) of 
NDMA/NDEA toxicity in humans are still not sufficiently clear.  
Therapeutic use of ARBs  
Arterial hypertension 
Concerning  arterial  hypertension  in  adults  in  general  all  of  the  ARBs  (for  detailed  indications  see 
introduction section) are mutually exchangeable provided specific dosing recommendations e.g. in case 
of  renal  failure  are  taken  into  consideration.  In  the  adult  population  there  is  a  variety  of  medicinal 
products  from  other  classes  that  can  serve  as  therapeutic  alternatives  (e.g.  ACE  inhibitors,  beta 
blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  diuretics).  A  switch  between  antihypertensive  products  requires 
medical  supervision.  In  patients  requiring  combination  therapy  or  with  severe  hypertension  therapy 
special attention is necessary to find an appropriate alternative. 
In the paediatric population with the exception of irbesartan all of the tetrazol-ARBs can be used and 
mutually exchanged whereas for none of the non-tetrazol ARB an indication or dosing recommendation 
has  been  approved.  Azilsartan  and  Telmisartan  are  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  essential 
hypertension in adults only. For Eprosartan the indication does not contain an age restriction, but the 
use  in  the  paediatric  population  is  not  recommended  in  the  absence  of  data.  Besides  tetrazol  ARBs 
there  are  a  number  of  different  options,  including  ACE  inhibitors,  beta  blockers,  long  acting  calcium 
antagonists, and diuretics for paediatric patients. In summary, drugs  from all of these classes can be 
considered as an alternative to treat arterial hypertension in the paediatric population.  
Heart failure 
Candesartan, Losartan and valsartan are indicated for the treatment of patients with heart failure. For 
most of the patients ACE inhibitors or sacubitril-valsartan are valid therapeutic alternatives. 
Treatment  of  renal  disease  in  adult  patients  with  hypertension  and  type  2  diabetes  as  part  of  the

Irbesartan  and  losartan  are  indicated.  In  addition,  ACE  inhibitors  may  be  considered  as  therapeutic 
alternatives if needed. 
Treatment  of  symptomatic  heart  failure  or  asymptomatic  left  ventricular  dysfunction  after  acute 
myocardial  infarction  (valsartan);  reduction  of  strokes  in  adult  patients  with  hypertension  and  left 
ventricular hypertrophy (losartan). 
ACE  inhibitors  are  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  symptomatic  heart  failure.  ACE  inhibitors  may  be 
considered as therapeutic alternatives if needed. 
Conclusion on clinical aspects 
In view of the  very low theoretical excess cancer risk, the fact that the risk estimation is based on a 
very conservative approach, the absence of an increase in overall cancer cases in a preliminary clinical 
cohort study, the risk of complications of invasive screening methods and the uncertainty of the target 
organ(s)  of  NDMA/NDEA  toxicity  in  humans,  the  CHMP  does  not  recommend  additional  monitoring  of 
previously exposed patients.  
ARBs are important for the treatment and prophylaxis of severe cardiovascular diseases and are in 
wide-spread use in the EU. Alternative medicinal products in the therapeutic areas (arterial 
hypertension, heart failure, cardiovascular prophylaxis, renal disease in special populations) are 
available as needed. Patients should not stop their sartan medicine without speaking to their doctor 
since it is much riskier to stop taking any sartan medicines than the risk related to potential 
nitrosamine impurities.  
3.  Expert consultation  
Ad-hoc expert consultation 
Following a request from CHMP, an ad-hoc expert consultation was convened on 19 July 2018 to 
provide advice on approach to be used in the calculation of the risk to develop cancer in patients who 
were exposed to NDMA contaminated valsartan-containing medicinal products. 
The experts discussed the relevant toxicological data available for NDMA, the models available for 
estimation of risk and, relevant study endpoints and best choice of point of departure for risk 
estimations and agreed on the following points: 
• 
The most relevant toxicological risk with NDMA exposure is carcinogenicity 
•  No reliable epidemiological data for humans are available to calculate excess risk levels  
• 
• 
• 
The most relevant endpoint for excess risk calculation is cancer in animals 
The scientifically most appropriate study for use for excess risk calculations is the extensive study 
in rats by Peto et al. (1991) 
The Bench Mark Dose Lower bound (BMDL) model is considered the scientifically most accepted 
model for analysis cancer studies  
•  As starting point, the Bench Mark Dose Lower bound with a Benchmark response of 10% (BMDL10 
for tumours, including all liver tumours) should be used. This is the considered the bench mark 
response mostly used to assess cancer studies.  
•  NDMA concentrations in finished product are more precise for risk assessment 
Assessment report

•  Realistic worst case scenarios should be use for estimation of total patient exposure 
• 
Environmental background exposure with nitrosamines. 
The advice provided by the experts was considered by the CHMP.  
Working Party consultation 
Safety Working Party (SWP)  
Consultation of the SWP took place in November 2018 and a summary of the conclusions is provided 
below: 
The SWP approach towards the risk assessment of NDMA and NDEA contaminations in sartan 
containing products is based on the praxis established by ICH M7(R1). This means calculating safety 
limits via a so called linear extrapolation method (a highly conservative approach). These limits are 
considered safe based on today’s generally regulatory accepted view that a theoretical additional 
contamination-linked risk of 1 cancer in 100,000 exposed subjects is acceptable. 
Question 1: The points of departure and methodology for calculating acceptable intake and 
excess carcinogenicity risk for NDMA and NDEA  
Two possible PoD approaches (TD 50 and BMDL 10, in line with ICH M7(R1) recommendations) are 
discussed and the TD 50 was selected as the appropriate PoD approach and identifies rat as the most 
appropriate animal species for the source data for the TD 50. SWP then recommended harmonic mean 
TD 50 value (the TD 50 across several animal studies of the same species) with 0.096mg/kg/day for 
NDMA and 0.0265mg/kg/day for NDEA. 
Question 2: The most appropriate methodology to estimate the cumulative excess 
carcinogenicity risk from exposure to both NDEA and NDMA 
Based on the mechanistic similarity underlying NDMA and NDEA hepato-carcinogenicity, a very 
simplified Toxic Equivalency Factor-Toxic Equivalency (TEF-TEQ)-like calculation approach is proposed 
for combining the risk estimations from both impurities. This approach regards an Environmental 
toxicology methodology used to make risk assessments of mixtures containing different classes of 
dioxins. The present cumulative risk assessment is based on that one uses the cumulative life time 
dose approach (discussed answer to question 1) together with the rat PoD values to select the most 
potent nitrosamine (NDEA if one uses harmonic mean TD 50) in order to convert the NDMA impact into 
an equivalent NDEA impact. It should be noted that a requirement is that one uses the same PoD 
approach (i.e. TD 50) for both nitrosamines. 
Q3: What is the adequacy of Ames test to screen mutagenic impurities in the APIs in the 
scope of this referral? 
The SWP does not consider that the Ames test can be used in this capacity. While there are some 
nitrosamine sensitive Ames tests (e.g. alkyl-transferase deficient S. typhimurium strains YG7100, 
YG7104 and/or YG7108) available that make nitrosamine studies possible, it is unlikely that using 
those for API batch screening will be meaningful. 
Q4: The species differences in target organs for NDMA/NDEA and potential target organs in 
humans?  
The SWP considers that any such extrapolation is highly uncertain. That being said, based on the most 
common nitrosamine-induced tumour across several animal species, the liver seems to be the most 
high-ranked possibility. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 32/41 
 
 
 
 
Q5: Can a safe limit for daily NDMA or NDEA intake be identified for sartan-containing 
medicinal products or is it considered necessary to avoid these impurities altogether? 
The European assessment procedures for mutagenic impurities in pharmaceuticals follow the ICH 
M7(R1) guideline. As outlined in ICH M7(R1), it is possible to define acceptable levels for mutagenic 
impurities based on an acceptable theoretical risk of 1 additional cancer among 100,000 subjects 
exposed life-long to the impurity, and which may be regarded as safe. According to the ICH M7(R1) 
guideline, NDMA and NDEA are known mutagenic carcinogens (class 1), for which the default TTC of 
1.5 µg/day is not acceptable, and therefore compound specific limits are considered necessary.  
Regarding the answer to this question, there are two different opinions within the SWP focussing on 
risk minimisation (view 1) and risk avoidance (view 2):  
I) Risk minimisation (view 1): The established AI approach as outlined in ICH M7(R1) utilizes a highly 
conservative risk estimation procedure which is considered appropriate as long as levels are kept below 
this threshold. There is no reason to diverge from the risk/benefit balance regulatory practices for 
handling mutagenic impurities. The reason is that there is no factual evidence that NDMA and NDEA 
are fundamentally different from other mutagenic carcinogens, which are covered by the TTC 
framework in ICH M7(R1), besides being more potent. This higher potency is handled by defining 
compound specific thresholds based on carcinogenicity data and by linear extrapolation. There is no 
necessity for a “no threshold” approach.  
II) Risk avoidance (view 2): This opinion states that manufacturing processes with any potential 
nitrosamine generating step should be avoided. This opinion is based on the view that any level of 
nitrosamine exposure of the public comes with a risk and there is no need to establish AIs for 
impurities in the first place as the contamination risk is considered to be avoidable by avoiding certain 
manufacturing processes.  
It should also be noted that while avoidance of a nitrosamine contamination via medicinal products 
would be preferable, considering the background exposure (from food, water etc.) of nitrosamines, it is 
impossible to avoid the intake of such impurities/substances altogether. On the other hand, while the 
European Food Safety Agency (EFSA )is active in reducing the food-mediated intake of nitrosamines by 
expressing recommendations in preparing food, the medicinal products should not add to the exposure 
in patients. 
Both views have in common that they focus on the safety of the patients to be treated with 
pharmacotherapy to lower blood pressure and related issues. 
Quality Working Party (QWP) 
A Consultation of the Quality Working Party took place in December 2018 and a summary of the 
conclusions is provided below: 
Q1) The potential root causes for contaminations of NDMA and NDEA. Please comment on 
the assessment of root causes identified by companies as appropriate. 
Companies whose APIs were contaminated with NDMA or NDEA (or other N-nitrosamine impurities) 
were requested to provide a thorough root cause analysis in the latest round of questions. Whilst it 
seems clear that the root cause of the problem is the combination of secondary amines and NaNO2 + 
acid, the source of the secondary amine is crucial to any mitigation strategy. Therefore, experimental 
data from companies is expected in order to determine the source of the secondary amine. 
Furthermore, companies should identify additional process parameters which are implicated in N-
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 33/41 
 
 
 
 
nitrosamine formation (e.g. temperature, stoichiometry, time, work up procedure, etc.). Conclusive 
data-based assessment of the root cause can only be done once the responses are received. 
Several root causes have been discussed. The list is unlikely to be exhaustive. The source of N-
nitrosamines could be down to one root cause, or a combination of several, which could also help 
explain overall variability in contamination. 
Q2) Potential mitigation measures for future valsartan, losartan, olmesartan, irbesartan, 
candesartan manufacturing and process changes in relation to the formation N-
nitrosamines. Provide input into assessment of proposed CAPAs in cases where 
nitrosamines were identified. 
To prevent N-nitrosamine formation, it is best to avoid use of NaNO2 until the API has been separated 
from the aqueous phase during work up. It should be noted that the purpose of the NaNO2 is to 
quench sodium azide, which is itself highly reactive and a genotoxic impurity. Therefore, it should be 
demonstrated using suitably sensitive and validated analytical methods that azide is adequately purged 
when using the proposed revised process before that source of API can be accepted. The same applies 
to any process where azide is used, especially when azide residues haven’t been quenched. Batch data 
demonstrating absence in the API should be provided. Further assessment is only possible on provision 
of additional data from the company. Furthermore, if NaNO2 is being used to quench azide away from 
the API, then solvents from this step should not be recovered and used in any process unless the risk 
of contamination with N-nitrosamines is suitably mitigated. 
Strategies which companies could adopt to mitigate risk of nitrosamine contamination include: 
• 
the use of alternative reaction conditions where the possibility of N-nitrosamine contamination 
is avoided completely. This could involve using different solvents (i.e. not amides such as DMF, 
DMA, NMP), different bases without secondary/tertiary amines (e.g. inorganic bases), or more 
hindered and thus less reactive amine bases; 
•  Change the order of reactions, introducing the tetrazole moiety at an earlier step – this gives 
more opportunity for purge of N-nitrosamines through subsequent synthesis steps and 
purification operations. It is good practice to carry out steps involving mutagens early in a 
synthetic sequence for exactly this reason; 
•  Off-line quenching of azide, following separation of aqueous and organic layers. This is the 
strategy proposed by ZHP. However, it remains to be seen how the azide is partitioned 
between aqueous and organic phases, and how much is left, following washing, in the product 
layer; 
•  Replacement of NaNO2 with alternative quenching agents (for azide destruction), e.g. sodium 
sulphite, sodium thiosulfate etc.;  
•  Additional purification steps to purge nitrosamine impurities (e.g. further crystallisations). It 
would need to be demonstrated that the N-nitrosamine impurity was sufficiently purged 
(dependent on input from SWP, the answer to question 3 below, and the capability of analytical 
methods (LoD, LoQ)) and this should be demonstrated for the API. If there is any potential for 
the presence of an N-nitrosamine impurity, a limit has to be set in the API (for transparency 
over life-cycle). It is also suggested that the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs may need updating 
with relevant limits for N-nitrosamine impurities. A production statement will be included in 
each relevant sartan monograph warning of the potential contamination with N-nitrosamine 
impurities. In addition, a general monograph will be published containing an analytical method 
for quantification of relevant N-nitrosamines; 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 34/41 
 
 
 
• 
The use of recovered solvents from steps where there is a risk of N-nitrosamine formation 
(either as part of the API process or as part of the recovery process) should be avoided, or it 
should be demonstrated that N-nitrosamines are adequately purged (i.e. they should be limited 
by specification). This applies particularly to the final step; 
•  Control of raw materials that may introduce nitrite (NO2
-) or N-nitrosamines. Examples of this 
are e.g. sodium azide, solvents and water; 
•  One MAH has claimed that NaBH4 or strong acid can be used to destroy  N-nitrosamines 
although experimental evidence is missing. There are further suggestions that N-nitrosamines 
can be degraded by exposure to UV light. Such treatments could be considered as methods of 
removing N-nitrosamine impurities although the active substance (or intermediate) would have 
to be stable under those conditions. 
As an alternative to not use nitrites, risk of N-nitrosamine formation can be mitigated by other means. 
However, in that case the demonstration of absence (or a sufficiently low level) of N-nitrosamines 
would have to be demonstrated in the API and included in the specification. The risk is lower when the 
formation of N-nitrosamines is avoided in the first place. 
ICH M7 option 4 or skip testing would not generally be appropriate given the potential risks of 
contamination, the batch to batch variability observed so far, and considering the very low acceptable 
levels of such impurities (i.e. the capability of analytical methods to determine that only a negligible 
amount of these impurities is present).  
Given the various potential sources of N-nitrosamines impurities, ICH M7 option 1 (i.e. a limit in the 
API specification) would generally be the most appropriate control method. 
In order for the MAHs to take responsibility for their finished product(s), including responsibility for the 
quality of the drug substance used in the finished product, they should ensure (via quality agreements) 
that it and the finished product manufacturer have access to relevant information from the active 
substance manufacturer concerning potential formation and presence of N-nitrosamine impurities, as 
well as potential cross-contamination, regardless of whether a limit has been established or not for 
these impurities. 
Q3) Input into the need to set limits for NDMA and NDEA or whether, given the potency, the 
proposed TTC, and the capability of analytical methods, no amount of N-nitrosamine would 
be acceptable. 
The outcome of the discussion at QWP on this topic was not fully conclusive. The majority favoured 
applying a limit. Some members underlined that such a limit approach is questionable for compounds 
like NDMA / NDEA, which may cause unacceptable toxicities. Therefore, it was concluded that a 
specification limit could only be applied if Safety Working Party (SWP) would agree that such a limit 
could be defined. An additional question to SWP was adopted by CHMP as follows: 
“Can a safe limit for daily NDMA or NDEA intake be identified for sartan-containing medicinal 
products or is it considered necessary to avoid these impurities altogether?” 
The ICH M7(R1) states that “some structural groups were identified to be of such high potency that 
intakes even below the TTC would theoretically be associated with a potential for a significant 
carcinogenic risk. This group of high potency mutagenic carcinogens referred to as the “cohort of 
concern”, comprises aflatoxin-like-, N-nitroso-, and alkyl-azoxy compounds.” It goes on to say that 
“compounds from some structural classes of mutagens can display extremely high carcinogenic 
potency (cohort of concern), i.e., aflatoxin-like-, N-nitroso-, and alkylazoxy structures. If these 
compounds are found as impurities in pharmaceuticals, acceptable intakes for these high-potency 
carcinogens would likely be significantly lower than the acceptable intakes defined in this guideline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 35/41 
 
 
 
Although the principles of this guideline can be used, a case-by-case approach using e.g., 
carcinogenicity data from closely related structures, if available, should usually be developed to justify 
acceptable intakes for pharmaceutical development and marketed products.” 
This suggests that setting a limit could be possible if such a limit is set based on compound-specific 
toxicity data, which is available for both NDMA and NDEA. 
The proposed limits for valsartan of 0.3 ppm (NDMA) and 0.08 ppm (NDEA) have been extrapolated, 
using conservative methodology, from compound-specific animal toxicological data. Similarly, limits for 
NDMA and NDEA have been tentatively assigned, based on the maximum daily dose of each sartan 
medicine (Tab).

In addition, if there is any potential of formation of N-nitrosamines in the process itself or in the 
process of recycling materials or originating from the environmental sources it would be safer to have 
a test and acceptance criteria in the specifications of the corresponding active substances. 
Overall, QWP’s opinion based on information currently available is that a limit for a given N-
nitrosamine should be set in the specification of the API, or an intermediate where justified, if there is 
a risk of it being present. The risk of cross-contamination from e.g. recovered solvents should be 
considered as part of this risk. The limit in the specification is dependent on input from SWP and 
toxicology experts. Given the variability that has been seen in the content of N-nitrosamines in 
affected sartans, the validity of the sampling scheme will need to be rigorously demonstrated.  
A consultation of the QWP (core team) in January 2019 focused on the definition of a limit which is 
based on analytical method capability. In summary, there was general consensus that using the LoD as 
a specification limit was not technically feasible due to the risk of false negative results and that if a 
technical limit was to be used, then it should be based on the LoQ, which would be used to derive a 
threshold. It was emphasized that neither LoD or LoQ are constant values and can change over time 
and depending on equipment, labs, personnel, sample preparation and many other factors. Therefore, 
companies should be developing their methods to be sensitive enough to meet the proposed 0.03 ppm 
threshold. In addition, it was proposed to request EDQM to develop a general analytical method and 
publish it in Ph. Eur. 
In addition, QWP generally agreed that synthetic routes which have a risk of generation of N-
nitrosamines should be avoided by first intent. It was also agreed that given the different sources of 
impurities, a limit in API specification is required.

4.  Benefit-risk balance 
4.1.   Benefit-risk balance assessment 
Sartan-containing medicinal products are important treatment options of serious or potentially serious 
conditions such as hypertension or certain heart or kidney diseases. Efficacy and safety of sartan-
containing medicines in these indications are per se well-established and are not questioned in this 
referral. The key issue of this referral concerns the detection of N-nitrosamine (esp. NDMA and/or 
NDEA) contaminations in sartans, the resulting potential long-term risk to patients and measures to 
minimise as much as possible these contaminations. 
Nitrosamines are chemically simple molecules and can be formed in pharmaceutical manufacturing 
steps whenever there is a presence of a secondary (or tertiary) amines and nitrites, usually in acidic 
conditions. This is the background to the current referral procedure. However, it should be noted that 
nitrosamines can also be formed in many other situations, including in biological processes.  
NDMA and NDEA are two of the most potent mutagenic carcinogens known. As soon as the problem of 
nitrosamine-contamination became known, immediate, precautionary measures were taken by 
competent authorities across the EU such as recalls of affected batches from pharmacies. Initially, this 
was only necessary for valsartan containing APIs from few manufacturers but later also for some other 
sartans with a tetrazole ring. 
Assessment of the excess risk of cancer 
The impact of NDMA and NDEA on human health is currently only extrapolated from animal studies. 
However, as the DNA damage mechanisms documented in these studies are also relevant in humans 
and in vitro data in human cells are not significantly different from those in animal cells, it is prudent 
to assume that effects seen in animals may also occur in humans after exposure to sufficiently large 
amounts of these nitrosamines. 
In addition to NDMA and NDEA, other N-nitrosamines have been detected in a few sartan-containing 
medicinal products. Risks resulting from multiple exposures are considered to add up in patients as 
mutagenic carcinogens are currently considered as summation toxins. 
The ICH M7(R1) guideline sets out principles for determining acceptable limits for mutagenic / DNA-
reactive impurities. The determination of an acceptable intake (AI) is based on extrapolation of 
carcinogenic risk from rodent carcinogenicity data, as the dose resulting in one cancer case among 
100,000 individuals exposed for a life-time to the impurity. N-nitrosamines belong to a “cohort of 
concern” compounds, for which the guideline states “Compounds from some structural classes of 
mutagens can display extremely high carcinogenic potency (cohort of concern), i.e., aflatoxin-like-, N-
nitroso-, and alkylazoxy structures. If these compounds are found as impurities in pharmaceuticals, 
acceptable intakes for these high-potency carcinogens would likely be significantly lower than the 
acceptable intakes defined in this guideline. Although the principles of this guideline can be used, a 
case-by-case approach using e.g., carcinogenicity data from closely related structures, if available, 
should usually be developed to justify acceptable intakes for pharmaceutical development and 
marketed products”.  
For these reasons, N-nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceuticals such as sartans intended for long-term 
use should be reduced as much as possible. 
A full risk assessment for patients previously exposed to NDMA and/or NDEA impurities in sartans, 
especially valsartan which was found to contain the highest nitrosamine contamination, is not possible 
as the real extent of exposure of patients is unkown. For an individual risk assessment, data on the 
exact finished products and batches used by each individual patient would be necessary. Thus, the risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 37/41 
 
 
 
assessment is based on a potential worst case scenario, which would be a partially combined exposure 
to the highest levels of NDEA for 4 years (2011 – 2015) and to NDMA for 6 years (2012 – 2018) 
reported from a sartan, resulting in a cumulative theoretical excess cancer risk of 29.5:100,000 or 
1:3390 (0.029%) when extrapolated from the above mentioned rat studies according to ICH M7(R1). 
Compared to the lifetime cancer risk in the European population of approximately 50%, this additional 
risk is considered to be very low.  
Measures to mitigate the risk 
Appropriate regulatory actions (such as quarantine or batch recalls) have been taken where relevant. 
Additional measures are needed to minimise prospectively the reoccurrence of such contamination. 
Based on all available data, the above conclusions on quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects , the 
CHMP requires the following: 
1. Obligatory risk assessments to be performed for manufacturing processes of the drug substances in 
order to evaluate the theoretical risk of N-nitrosamine formation and contamination 
2. Modifying manufacturing processes, where necessary, to minimise contamination as much as 
possible. 
3. Implement a control strategy to detect and control N-nitrosamine impurities in the API (or 
intermediate, if justified). 
Specifically, CHMP considered that NDMA and NDEA limits should be as low as technically possible. In 
this regard, a LoQ of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA would be achievable according to the available 
data on analytical methods. This limit is considered a sufficiently robust threshold for APIs that can 
technically be reached. In comparison to the AI levels calculated based on ICH M7(R1) using non-
clinical toxicology, it is possible to generate additional safety factors ranging from 2.73 – 27.3 for 
NDMA and 10.0 – 100 for NDEA, by defining 0.03 ppm as the common technical target limit for NDEA 
and NDMA in tetrazole sartan APIs. The underlying concept of the proposed approach is to keep the 
amount of N-nitrosamine impurities as low as possible, irrespective of  type of sartan or dose. 
The limit of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA will be enforceable after a transitional period of 2 years 
from the notification of the Commission Decision. During this time period, MAHs and manufacturers are 
requested to introduce relevant changes to the manufacturing processes of the drug substances, as 
well as develop appropriate analytical methods while ensuring adequate supply of the market for these 
essential medicinal products. An interim limit based on AIs according to principles in ICH M7(R1) using 
toxicology data are set in order to control these impurities in the meantime to an acceptable level.  
Whilst the measures are focused on NDMA and NDEA, the principles described in this assessment in 
terms of toxicology assessment, control strategy and changes to the manufacturing processes for drug 
substances should be applied by analogy to other nitrosamines. 
In case of identification of other nitrosamines, this should be forthwith reported to the competent 
authorities, together with a toxicology assessment of the impurity, a clinical assessment for the 
exposed patients, a root cause analysis and a corrective action plan (e.g. changes to the 
manufacturing process). 
Considerations on monitoring of exposed patients 
The above stated very small theoretical risk has to be balanced against the risks of measures to 
monitor patients such as colonoscopy or gastroscopy which may exceed the theoretical excess cancer 
risk. For example, a recent review has estimated risks of perforation of 4 per 10,000 (95% confidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/217823/2019  
Page 38/41 
 
 
 
 
 
interval, 2-5) and major haemorrhage of 8 per 10,000 (95% confidence interval, 5-14) with screening 
colonoscopy (Lin et al. JAMA 2016). In addition, advancing age, comorbidity and use of anticoagulants 
were found to be strongly associated with both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal complications. 
Furthermore, the target organ(s) of NDMA/NDEA toxicity in humans are still not sufficiently clear.For 
these reasons, CHMP could not identify cancer screening methods that patients would benefit from.  
Overall, taking into account the available data discussed above, the benefit risk balance of medicines 
containing a sartan with a tetrazole ring remains positive subject to the conditions outlined below.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Active immunisation against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Primary vaccination (individuals previously not vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia 
viruses) 
A first dose of 0.5 ml should be administered on an elected date. 
A second dose of 0.5 ml should be administered no less than 28 days after the first dose, see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
Booster vaccination (individuals previously vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia 
viruses) 
There are inadequate data to determine the appropriate timing of booster doses. If a booster dose is 
considered necessary then a single dose of 0.5 ml should be administered, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
2 
Special population 
Immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV infected, patients under immunosuppressive therapy) who 
have been previously vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses should receive two 
booster doses. The second booster vaccination should be given no less than 28 days after the first 
booster dose. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of IMVANEX in children below 18 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous injection, preferably into the upper arm. 
For instructions on administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or trace 
residues (chicken protein, benzonase, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. 
Concurrent illness 
Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or 
acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not result in the 
deferral of vaccination. 
General recommendations 
IMVANEX should not be administered by intravascular injection. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
The protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia 
virus has not been studied in humans, see section 5.1. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. 
There are inadequate data to determine the appropriate timing of booster doses. 
Prior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response (‘take’) to subsequently 
administered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take, see 
section 5.1. 
3 
Individuals with atopic dermatitis 
Individuals with atopic dermatitis developed more local and general symptoms after vaccination (see 
section 4.8) 
Immunocompromised individuals 
Data have been generated in HIV infected individuals with CD4 counts ≥ 100 cells/µl and 
≤ 750 cells/µl. Lower immune response data have been observed in HIV infected individuals 
compared to healthy individuals (see section 5.1). There are no data on the immune response to 
IMVANEX in other immunosuppressed individuals. 
Two doses of IMVANEX given at a 7-day interval showed lower immune responses and slightly more 
local reactogenicity than two doses given at a 28-day interval. Therefore, dose intervals of less than 
28 days should be avoided. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say 
essentially ’sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies with other vaccines or medicinal products have been performed. Therefore, 
concomitant administration of IMVANEX with other vaccines should be avoided. 
The concomitant administration of the vaccine with any immunoglobulin including Vaccinia Immune 
Globulin (VIG) has not been studied and should be avoided. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of IMVANEX in pregnant 
women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of IMVANEX 
during pregnancy. Administration of Imvanex in pregnancy should only be considered when the 
potential benefits outweigh any potential risk to the mother and foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether IMVANEX is excreted in human milk. As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of IMVANEX during breast-feeding. Administration of Imvanex during 
breast-feeding should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks to 
the mother and baby. 
Fertility 
Animal studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired female and male fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
There is no information on the effect of IMVANEX on the ability to drive or use machines. However, 
some of the undesirable effects mentioned in section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or use 
machines (e.g. dizziness). 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of IMVANEX has been assessed in 20 clinical trials in which 5 261 Vaccinia-naïve 
individuals received two doses of no less than 5 x 107 Inf.U four weeks apart while 534 Vaccinia- and 
IMVANEX-experienced individuals received a single booster dose. 
The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were injection site reactions and 
common systemic reactions typical for vaccines which were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved 
without intervention within seven days following vaccination. 
Adverse reaction rates reported after either vaccination dose (1st, 2nd or booster) were similar.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) 
In a non-placebo controlled clinical trial that compared the safety of IMVANEX in individuals with 
AD to healthy individuals, individuals with AD reported erythema (61.2%) and swelling (52.2%) at 
the injection site with a higher frequency than healthy individuals (49.3% and 40.8%, respectively). 
The following general symptoms were reported more frequently in individuals with AD compared to 
healthy individuals: headache (33.1% vs. 24.8%), myalgia (31.8% vs. 22.3%), chills (10.7% vs. 
3.8 %), nausea (11.9% vs. 6.8%), and fatigue (21.4% vs. 14.4%). 
7% of the individuals with AD in clinical trials with IMVANEX experienced a flare-up or worsening 
of their skin condition during the course of the trial.  
Rash 
IMVANEX  may trigger  local  rashes  or more  widespread eruptions.  Events  of  rash  after  vaccination 
(related cases observed in 0.4% of subjects) with IMVANEX tend to occur within the first days after 
vaccination, are mild to moderate in intensity and usually resolve without sequelae. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX 
Efficacy in animals 
Non-human primate (NHP) studies have demonstrated that vaccination with IMVANEX induced a 
comparable immune response and protective efficacy to traditional smallpox vaccines used to 
eradicate smallpox and protected NHP from severe disease associated with a lethal challenge of 
monkeypox virus. As seen with traditional smallpox vaccines, a significant reduction in both mortality 
and morbidity (viral load, weight loss, number of pox lesions, etc.) compared to non-vaccinated 
controls was demonstrated for NHP vaccinated with IMVANEX. 
Mouse studies have demonstrated that vaccination with IMVANEX protected mice from a lethal 
challenge of replicating vaccinia virus. 
Immunogenicity 
Seroconversion to vaccinia in Vaccinia-naïve healthy and special populations 
The Vaccinia-naïve study population included healthy individuals as well as individuals with HIV 
infection and AD who received 2 doses of IMVANEX 4 weeks apart. Seroconversion rates in 
Vaccinia-naïve individuals were defined as appearance of vaccinia antibody titers equal or greater than 
the assay cut-off value following receipt of two doses of IMVANEX. Seroconversion by ELISA and 
PRNT were as follows:

Immunogenicity and attenuation of take of ACAM2000 in healthy subjects 
Imvanex was compared to ACAM2000 (a 'second generation' live attenuated smallpox vaccine 
produced in cell culture and licenced in the United States of America) in a randomized, open-label 
non-inferiority clinical trial in healthy adults (US military personnel) aged 18 to 42 years and who 
were naïve to smallpox vaccine (Study POX-MVA-006). 
A total of 433 subjects were randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either two doses of Imvanex 
followed by a single dose of ACAM2000 at four weeks intervals or to receive a single dose of 
ACAM2000. ACAM2000 was administered via scarification. 
The first co-primary endpoint compared vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody responses at the peak 
visits (day 42 after first vaccination for Imvanex where the subjects received two doses according to 
the standard vaccination schedule and day 28 for ACAM2000). Imvanex induced a peak neutralizing 
antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) of 153.5 (n = 185; 95% CI 134.3, 175.6), which was non-
inferior to the GMT of 79.3 (n = 186; 95% CI 67.1, 93.8) obtained after scarification with 
ACAM2000. 
The second co-primary endpoint evaluated if vaccination with Imvanex (n = 165) prior to 
administration of ACAM2000 results in an attenuation of the cutaneous reaction to ACAM2000 (n = 
161) as measured by maximum lesion area in mm2. At day 13-15, the median maximum lesion area for
subjects who were administered ACAM2000 was 75mm2 (95% CI 69.0, 85.0) and for those who
received Imvanex it was 0.0 (95% CI 0.0, 2.0).
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IMVANEX in all subsets of the paediatric population for prevention of smallpox, monkeypox and 
disease caused by vaccinia virus by active immunisation against smallpox, monkeypox and disease 
caused by vaccinia virus infection and disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What IMVANEX is and what it is used for
IMVANEX is a vaccine used to prevent smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in 
adults. 
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection in the form of antibodies against the smallpox, monkeypox and vaccinia 
viruses. 
IMVANEX does not contain smallpox virus (Variola) or monkeypox virus or vaccinia viruses. It 
cannot spread or cause smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia infection and disease. 
2. What you need to know before you are given IMVANEX
You must not receive IMVANEX: 
•
if you are allergic or have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to the active
substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) or chicken protein,
benzonase, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin which may be present in the vaccine in very small
amounts.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving IMVANEX: 
•
if you have atopic dermatitis (see section 4).
•
if you have HIV infection or any other condition or treatment leading to a weakened immune
system.
The protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia 
virus has not been studied in humans. 
23 
In case of illness with high temperature, your doctor will postpone the vaccination until you are 
feeling better. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of 
the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
IMVANEX may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. 
Prior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response (‘take’) to subsequently 
administered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take. 
Other medicines or vaccines and IMVANEX 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or if you have 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are a pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
to your doctor for advice. The use of this vaccine during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not 
recommended. However, your doctor will assess whether the possible benefit in terms of preventing 
smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus would outweigh the potential risks to you 
and your foetus/baby.  
Driving and using machines 
There is no information on the effect of IMVANEX on your ability to drive or use machines. 
However, it is possible that if you experience any of the side effects listed in section 4, then some of 
these may affect your ability to drive or use machines (e.g. dizziness). 
IMVANEX contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ’sodium-
free’. 
3.
How IMVANEX is given
You can be given this vaccine whether or not you have received smallpox vaccination in the past. 
The vaccine will be injected under the skin, preferably into the upper arm, by your doctor or a nurse. It 
must not be injected into a blood vessel. 
If you have never been vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses: 
•
•
•
You will receive two injections.
The second injection will be given no less than 28 days after the first.
Make sure you complete the vaccination course of two injections.
If you have previously been vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses: 
•
•
You will receive one injection.
If your immune system is weakened you will receive two injections with the second injection no
less than 28 days after the first.
If you miss an appointment for your injection of IMVANEX 
If you miss a scheduled injection, tell your doctor or nurse and arrange another visit. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse.

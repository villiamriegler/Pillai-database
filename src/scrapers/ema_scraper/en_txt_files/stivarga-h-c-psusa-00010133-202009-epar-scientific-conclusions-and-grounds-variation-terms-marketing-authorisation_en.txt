  Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for regorafenib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The adverse reactions (ADRs) pain (very common, i.e. ≥1/10) and headache (common) are listed 
ADRs for regorafenib in the Summary  of Product Characteristics (SmPC). As requested, the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) provided a review of the most frequently reported preferred terms (PTs) 
related to pain. From clinical trial (CT) data the most frequently reported PTs were abdominal pain and 
back pain (≥10%). It is justified to include “most frequently reported types of pain (≥10%) are 
abdominal pain and back pain” to the footnotes of the table of ADR. 
The risk of severe liver injury (including fatal outcome) is a listed ADR (uncommon) in the SmPC. 
Acute liver failure refers to the development of severe acute liver injury with encephalopathy and 
impaired synthetic function (International Normalized Ratio (INR) of ≥1.5). The review of the MAH 
focuses on 16 cases, two of which next to severe liver injury also report encephalopathy (and in one 
case also INR≥1.5). Although both cases are reported in context of metastasis to liver, the TTO is 
suggestive in both cases (5 and 17 days respectively), and they both report a positive de-challenge, 
arguing against liver metastases as cause. The MAH is requested to update the table of ADRs of 
Section 4.8 to include Severe liver injury (including hepatic failure) under System Organ Class (SOC) 
Hepatobiliary  disorders. Section 4.4 of the SmPC is also updated to add (hepatic failure) to the exiting 
hepatic effects. 
The CT data show an imbalance for the risk of “constipation” in regorafenib arm  vs. placebo (RR 1.3; 
95%CI being 1.053-1.623 --> p= 0.007). The risk should be included in the table of ADRs with 
frequency very common based on CT data.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for regorafenib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing regorafenib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

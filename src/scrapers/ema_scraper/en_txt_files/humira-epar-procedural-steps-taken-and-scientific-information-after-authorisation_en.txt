complications secondary to diabetic retinopathy, due to 
cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the 
primary analysis of efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 
269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-
label adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data 
approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active 
inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade  ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 
0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg per day, 
and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA 
was either improved or maintained (< 5 letters 
deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data 
beyond Week 78 were generally consistent with these 
results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after 
this time. Overall, among the patients who discontinued the 
study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8% 
due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment.

women with RA or CD not treated with adalimumab were 
enrolled. There were no distinct differences between 
adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the primary 
and also for secondary endpoints and no stillbirths or 
malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may 
be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, 
including small sample size and non-randomized design. 
Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if 
clearly needed. 
Limited information from the published literature indicates 
that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at very low 
concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human 
milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal 
serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins 
undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. 
No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are 
anticipated. Consequently, Humira can be used during 
breastfeeding.

either continued treatment with Humira 40 mg eow 
(N=152) or placebo (N=153) for an additional 40 weeks in 
a double-blind, placebo-controlled period (total study 
duration 68 weeks). Subjects who flared during the double-

therapy for at least 12 weeks. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was the proportion of patients with no flare by 
Week 68 of the study. By Week 68, patients receiving

Some patients who experience a decrease in their response 
to include 80mg every other week (eow) as an 
alternative dosing option to the current approved 40 
mg weekly dose in the following relevant indications: 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), 
paediatric CD (patients ≥ 40 kg), psoriasis (Ps), 
to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit from an 
increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80

Week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of 
patients who received Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 
'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to 
patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, 
respectively [P = 0.014]). The safety profile of 
adalimumab-treated subjects was consistent with what has 
been observed in other adalimumab clinical trials in 
subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis. Adalimumab was 
generally safe and well tolerated as evaluated by TEAEs 
including deaths and SAEs, TEAEs of special interest, 
laboratory values, and vital signs values. No new safety 
signal was generated by this study. In addition, no signals

endpoint, measured over the course of the study, was 
ASAS40 response at Week 12. The study duration was 156 
weeks; the mean duration of exposure was 792 days, and 
median 1008. Half of the subjects receiving any 
adalimumab experienced a TEAE, and 8% discontinued due 
to this. No particular AE seems to be associated with 
withdrawal from the study. Consistent with the known 
safety profile of Humira, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis and 
sinusitis were the most commonly reported AEs. The CHMP

data 
M06-826 and M06-827 and the open-label extension Study 
M10-223, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-
related hospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-
treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The number of 
all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment 
group was 0.18 per patient year vs. 0.26 per patient year 
in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-
related hospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year vs. 0.22 
per patient year. Based on the data from the placebo-
controlled Study M06-827, treatment with adalimumab 
resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score. Results from Study 
M06-827 allowed addition of Week 52 efficacy data in Week 
8 responders per full Mayo score. Of those patients who 
had a response at Week 8, 47% were in response, 29% 
were in remission, 41% had mucosal healing, and 20% 
were in steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days at Week 52. 
Based on data from all patients that received at least one 
dose of adalimumab in studies M06-826, M06-827 or M10-
223, the remission rate in subjects treated with 
adalimumab for at least 3 years is added. Following 3 years 
of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) subjects continued 
to be in clinical remission per partial Mayo score supporting 
a sustained efficacy in responders. In order to increase the 
traceability for a specific batch and also to enable

postmarketing databases for reports of possible Merkel Cell 
Carcinoma (MCC) or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin 
coincident with adalimumab therapy identified 15 reports of 
MCC. One report was from clinical trials and there were 14 
postmarketing reports. Of the 14 postmarketing reports, 
most of them had confounding factors and/or limited 
information to fully assess causality with adalimumab and 1 
report had no confounding factors or alternative etiology 
reported. The 1 report of MCC from a clinical trial also had 
confounding factors. There were no fatalities due to MCC 
among the total of 15 reports of MCC. Although it is not 
clear whether the appearance of MCC in patients receiving 
adalimumab might be due to a number of factors such as 
other TNF inhibitor therapy, the underlying autoimmune 
diseases, sun exposure, the patient's age, or exposure to

other non-biologic immunosuppressant therapy, the 
possible contribution of adalimumab use to the risk cannot 
be excluded. Therefore MCC is added to section 4.8 
‘Undesirable effects’ of the SmPC, with a frequency 
category of “unknown”. The severity and seriousness of the 
event of MCC also justify its addition to section 4.4 ‘Special 
warnings and precautions for use’ to warn the prescribing 
physicians that cases of MCC have been reported in 
patients treated with TNF-antagonists including 
adalimumab. The Risk Management Plan was updated to

Results showed that there are postmarketing reports of 
liver failure among adalimumab treated patients. The 
analysis does not suggest a primary causal relationship 
between adalimumab therapy and these hepatic events. 
Although a relationship to adalimumab cannot be 
established, the severity and seriousness of the event of 
liver failure justify its addition to section 4.8 of the SmPC 
with a frequency category of unknown. The MAH performed 
an additional comprehensive review of reports of toxic 
hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, acute

that may occur during adalimumab therapy may be 
preceded by milder liver events, the hepatobiliary disorder 
section in 4.8 is updated to reflect that there have been 
post-marketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe 
liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such as 
hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis (added within 
EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0093) in patients receiving

among the 2143 medically confirmed reports, without an 
alternate etiology for pyrexia such as infection or disease 
flare. In the majority of the 139 reports, pyrexia resolved 
with or without antipyretic treatment and did not lead to 
the discontinuation of adalimumab. In many reports, there 
was also a temporal relationship between the 
administration of adalimumab and the development of 
pyrexia. In 3 reports, pyrexia was accompanied by a 
positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge reaction. In each of 
the 3 reports, pyrexia without any accompanying medical 
problems other than the underlying medical conditions 
occurred after each injection of adalimumab. The pyrexia 
event in each case resolved without any antipyretic 
medication following the discontinuation of adalimumab. 
Based on this data the event of pyrexia is added to section 
4.8 of the SmPC. The frequency of “Common” for the event 
has been determined from the data observed in the pivotal 
controlled trials.

reports of TB coincident with adalimumab therapy was 
conducted for the period of 31 December 2002 to 31 
December 2010. The review identified 112 patients having 
reactivated TB coincident with adalimumab use. Of these 
112 patients identified as having reactivated TB, most 
(nearly 60%) were reported to have received TB 
prophylactic treatment, though the reports had limited 
information on the anti-TB medications, dosage and 
treatment duration. There were numerous reports where it 
is not known whether prophylactic treatment was provided. 
It appears that in many cases the diagnosis of reactivated 
TB was made based upon a positive PPD skin test but a 
Page 40/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
negative chest X-ray, however in some cases 
documentation suggests that the diagnosis was reached 
solely on the basis of a positive PPD test (and therefore 
these cases could have represented false-positive 
diagnoses due, for example, to prior vaccination for TB). 
Nevertheless, overall, there seems to be a non-negligible 
risk of TB reactivation in spite of prophylactic treatment in 
certain patients. Therefore physicians should be made 
aware that despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, 
cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients 
treated with adalimumab.

prevented proper evaluation, 8 were assessed to be 
confounded and 2 did not have an alternate etiology. 
Overall, the majority of reported post-marketing cases had 
confounding factors or limited information to properly 
assess the event. In some cases with limited information 
there are reported elements such as presence of auto-
antibodies or recovery after withdrawal that could make the 
diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis plausible. Of the 49 
consumer reports, 6 were reports of autoimmune hepatitis 
but none of them provided sufficient information for 
appropriate assessment. In the placebo controlled trials 
there were no reports of autoimmune hepatitis in patients 
receiving either placebo, methotrexate or adalimumab. 
Expanding to the open-label data set a total of 9 reports 
was identified. Of these, 4 events of autoimmune hepatitis 
(2 serious and 2 non-serious) in 3 individuals were 
identified. In 2 of the 3 cases the event was considered by 
the investigator as possibly related to study drug. The 
remaining cases did not meet the case definition for 
autoimmune hepatitis. The estimated incidence rate in all 
exposed adalimumab patients of clinical trials is <0.1 
autoimmune hepatitis events per 100 patient years. While 
there were several cases with confounders or limited 
information, it is not possible to exclude the contribution of 
adalimumab to the development of autoimmune hepatitis 
given the temporal relationship between adalimumab 
therapy and the development of autoimmune hepatitis in 
most of these reports. Consequently autoimmune hepatitis 
is added to section 4.8 of the SmPC as new adverse event 
with a frequency of rare. The RMP was updated to include 
autoimmune hepatitis as an important identified risk.

the 102 postmarketing cases, 95 were medically confirmed 
reports and 7 were from consumers. Of the 95 medically 
confirmed reports, there were 5 reports that did not meet 
the case definition of Legionella infection. Of the 90 reports 
remaining, 67 were assessed to be confounded, 11 had 
limited information which prevented proper evaluation, and 
12 did not have an alternate etiology. Five reports of 
Pneumonia Legionella had fatal outcome but also 
confounding factors or alternative aetiologies for the event. 
In 12 of the 13 reports in clinical trials, the events of 
Legionella infection were considered either probably or 
possibly related to study drug. One of these cases had a 
fatal outcome confounded by concomitant methotrexate 
and steroids.  
Overall the majority of reported cases had confounding 
factors or alternative aetiologies for the event. While there 
were confounders, it is not possible to exclude the 
contribution of adalimumab to the development of 
Legionella infection given the temporal relationship 
between adalimumab therapy and the development of 
infection in most of these reports. Consequently 
legionellosis is added to the warning section concerning 
infections as serious infections that have been reported in 
patients receiving adalimumab. Legionellosis is also 
covered in the educational program for serious infections as 
described in the RMP.

adult patients on concomitant treatment with AZA or 6-MP

Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients 
receiving a TNF-antagonist, including adalimumab, who are 
chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). 
Some cases had a fatal outcome. Patients should therefore 
be tested for HBV infection – irrespective of any risk factors 
- before initiating treatment with adalimumab. For patients 
who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with 
a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is 
recommended.

prevented and breast feeding avoided as well as for 
monitoring of infections after discontinuation of 
adalimumab treatment. Based on single dose studies the 
average mean half-life of adalimumab is 14 days. The 
CHMP however considered that, although the mean 
estimated half-life has been found to be 14 days, it 
generally varies between 10 and 20 days, and that the 
upper 99% interval in a population analysis was 25.7 days. 
As variability exists for the estimation of half-life the 
calculation of the monitoring period cannot be based on an 
average value. A conservative approach using the 
estimated upper 99% interval of 25.7 days gives a time 
period of 129 days. Based on this result the CHMP accepted 
to shorten the monitoring period for infections from 5 to 4 
months. The period in which pregnancies should be 
prevented and breast feeding avoided remain unchanged.

responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment 
evaluation in the open label extension study. During the 
withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over 
time with a median time to relapse (decline to PGA 
"moderate" or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of 
these patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal 
period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered

not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A 
similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as 
before withdrawal. Incidence of immunogenicity was low

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
conducted. A total of five patients experienced 6 events of 
sarcoidosis from clinical trials. One of these 5 patients was 
a participant in a randomized controlled trial receiving 
adalimumab. There were no sarcoidosis events among the 
patients in the comparator arm. Of the 5 reports of 
sarcoidosis 4 were serious and 1 non-serious. One event of 
the 5 reports was deemed possibly related to adalimumab 
therapy and the other events were considered not related. 
A cumulative review of reports of sarcoidosis and related 
terms from the MAH postmarketing safety database was 
conducted. A total of 151 reports of possible sarcoidosis 
were retrieved from this search (as of 15 April 2010). Of 
these, 129 were medically confirmed. Of these 129 reports, 
87 were excluded from the review as they reported 
erythema nodosum, pulmonary granuloma or granuloma 
without a specific diagnosis or evidence of sarcoidosis. Five 
further reports were excluded, 3 events were not related to 
adalimumab and 2 from blinded clinical trials in which the 
patient did not receive adalimumab or the study remains 
blinded. Of the 37 remaining medically confirmed reports, 
24 described at least 1 serious event and 13 described non-
serious events. Of the 37 reports, 22 had no apparent 
confounding factors or alternative aetiologies and 8 had 
potential confounding factors such as evidence of prior 
sarcoidosis which reappeared or worsened with 
adalimumab therapy. Overall, the causal relationship 
between the use of adalimumab and the appearance of 
sarcoidosis is difficult to establish in part because it is a 
difficult diagnosis to make and the aetiology is unknown. 
Given the number of medically confirmed cases without 
confounding factors or alternative aetiologies and evidence 
that TNF-? participates in sarcoidosis events, it is not

(82%) identified an aetiology or confounding factors for 
pleural effusion. The most common aetiology described in 
these 142 reports was infection (93/142, 65%) followed by 
cardiac disease (20/142, 14%). Rheumatoid arthritis was 
the cause or a possible cause of pleural effusion in 22

definitive cause or confounding factors for the pleural 
effusion event (32/174, 18%). Pleural effusions are 
associated with a variety of medical conditions including the 
most common indication for adalimumab, rheumatoid 
arthritis. The other potential causes of pleural effusion 
include malignancy and infections which are currently 
identified as risks in the adalimumab SmPC. Overall, pleural 
effusion is a relatively common disorder in patients taking 
TNF inhibitors including adalimumab. Due to the large 
number of medically confirmed postmarketing reports, 
many of which described a serious event, the undesirable 
effect "pleural effusion" is added to section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

administration of corticosteroid during induction

inflammatory markers in the colon, on mucosal

the colon of patients with Crohn's disease including a 
significant reduction of expression of TNF? in the colon

patients with intestinal mucosa healing at week 12 have 
shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated

In Study M04-690 and Study M02-433, 69.5% (189/272 
subjects) and 75.2% (88/117 subjects), respectively, 
continued to be in clinical remission at 3 years. Clinical 
response (CR-100) was maintained in 85.7% (233/272) 
subjects and 87.2% (102/117 subjects), respectively.  
Study M02-404 showed that with adalimumab maintenance 
therapy (both 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every 
week) the numbers of patients on active treatment 
requiring all-cause of hospitalization was smaller than in 
placebo-treated patients at week 56. The risk for Crohn's 
disease-related hospitalization was also statistically 
significantly reduced with adalimumab compared with 
placebo at Week 56. 
Post-hoc analyses of studies M05-769, M02-403, M04-691 
and M02-404 have been conducted to evaluate the effect of 
concomitant administration of corticosteroids on the rates 
of clinical remission and response at Week 4 of adalimumab 
induction therapy. The pooled analyses in the subset of 
subjects with severe CD treated with 160 mg at Week 0 
and 80 mg at Week 2 from Study M05-769, Study M02-403

with severe Crohn's disease treated with 80 mg at Week 0 
and 40 mg at Week 2 from Study M02-403 and Study M02-

the frequency of serious infections among adalimumab 
treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.9%) was higher 
than for those under 65 years of age (1.4%).  Some of 
those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention regarding 
the risk for infection should be paid when treating the 
elderly population. Analyses of risk factors for serious 
infection also identified lung disease as contributing risk 
factor for development of serious infections. Therefore the 
existing warning informing that patients taking TNF-
blockers are more susceptible to serious infections is 
reinforced by adding that impaired lung function may 
increase the risk for developing infections.

harmonize the statement on Haematologic Reactions 
with the latest ADR table from clinical trials.

A review of reports of diverticulitis showed a number of 
these patients had risk factors for diverticulitis, including 
advanced age, obesity, NSAID or corticosteroid use, or a 
history of diverticulitis or diverticulosis. This cumulative 
analysis of diverticulitis reports supports the reinstatement 
of diverticulitis in the SmPC as a post-marketing event. 
A total of 32 reports that described Steven Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme (EM) were 
retrieved from the search strategy, 23 reports of EM and 9 
reports of SJS. Overall the cumulative analysis of 
postmarketing adverse event reports of EM and SJS 
confirms the previous inclusion of SJS in the SmPC and 
justifies the reinstatement of EM as postmarketing event in 
the SmPC as postmarketing events. 
The company safety database was reviewed for reports of 
alopecia. Eleven reports had no apparent confounding

factors for hair loss identified. No identifiable pattern in the 
demographics or time to onset was seen that would 
distinguish these patients from those within the patient 
population treated with adalimumab. However due to the 
number of medically confirmed postmarketing reports, the 
addition of alopecia as postmarketing event to the CCDS 
and subsequently the SmPC is justified. 
Regarding embolic and thrombotic events, there were 19 
medically confirmed reports, of which 9 (47%) were 
spontaneous reports from healthcare professionals or 
authorities, 8 (42%) were solicited reports (e.g., registries, 
observational studies) and 2 (11%) were reports from 
clinical trials. Pulmonary embolism is a possible but rare 
outcome of having thrombophlebitis. In spite of the risk 
factors and confounding factors, the role of adalimumab 
cannot be completely ruled out.

development of these malignancies and adalimumab. It is 
possible that concomitant exposure to other 
immunosuppressants and/or presence of underlying 
autoimmune diseases were contributory factors. 
Nevertheless, given its mechanism of action as TNF-
blocking agent it cannot be excluded that adalimumab may 
be also a contributing factor in the development of the 
observed malignancies. Therefore mention is made in the 
SmPC that, in the post-marketing setting, cases of 
leukaemia and malignancies in children, adolescents and 
young adults (up to 22 years of age) have been reported in 
patients treated with a TNF-antagonist, including 
adalimumab. In paediatric patients approximately half the 
cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a 
variety of different malignancies and included rare 
malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression. 
Overall, a risk for the development of malignancies in 
children and adolescents treated with TNF-blockers cannot 
be excluded. 
The warning wording on invasive fungal infections was 
amended in order to reinforce the message that diagnosis 
and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in patients 
taking adalimumab should be made in consultation with a 
physician with expertise in the care of patients with 
invasive fungal infection.

on tuberculosis was also revised to include the information 
that this disease, including fatalities, had been reported in 
patients taking Humira. This section was also updated to 
include the safety information that cases of worsening 
congestive heart failure have been reported in patients 
receiving adalimumab. The section 4.8 "Undesirable 
effects" was updated following reports of occurrence of 
cutaneous vasculitis in patients taking Humira. This adverse 
effect has been  reported with a frequency of rare.

purpose was to revise the warnings section and include 
details of the post-marketing experience on malignancies 
and lymphoproliferative disorders, including incidence.  In 
clinical trials, more cases of lymphoma have been observed 
among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with 
control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. 
Additionally, there is an increased background lymphoma 
risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, 
highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the 
risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk 
for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in 
patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.

(Undesirable effects) "serious allergic reactions including 
anaphylaxis".  
A consequential change to the Package Leaflet, in section 2 
(Before you use Humira), is proposed in order to reflect the 
safety warning relating to the possible risk of infection in 
patients undergoing surgery. Advice is already included in 
the current Package leaflet relating to allergic reactions and

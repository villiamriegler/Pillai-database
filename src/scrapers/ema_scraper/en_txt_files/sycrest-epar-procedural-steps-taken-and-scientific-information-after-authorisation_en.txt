open label, uncontrolled extension study. In this trial, a 
total of 34.8 % of subjects experienced clinically significant 
weight increase (i.e., ≥ 7 % increase in body weight at 
endpoint). Overall mean (SD) weight gain at study 
endpoint was 3.5 (5.76) kg. The clinically relevant adverse 
reactions identified in the paediatric trials were generally 
similar to those observed in the adult trials. However, 
adverse effects of treatment on weight gain and on plasma 
lipid profile appeared to be greater than effects observed in 
the adult trials. Long term efficacy could not be established 
in the trial.

Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Additionally, the MAH took the opportunity to

pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy in paediatric 
population was included in the product information of 
Sycrest.  
In a PK study using flavoured sublingual tablets, at the 5 
mg and 10 mg twice daily dose level, asenapine 
pharmacokinetics in a paediatric population (10 to 17 years 
of age, inclusive) are similar to those observed in adults. 
The 10 mg twice daily dose resulted in an approximate 
dose proportional increase in asenapine exposure compared 
to 5 mg twice daily. Based on this small pharmacokinetic 
study, paediatric patients appeared to be more sensitive to 
dystonia with initial dosing with asenapine when a gradual 
up-titration schedule was not followed. The incidence of 
dystonia in paediatric clinical trials using a gradual up-

data 
titration was similar to that seen in adult trials. 
The safety and efficacy of Sycrest was evaluated in 
403 paediatric patients with bipolar I disorder who 
participated in a single, 3 week, placebo controlled, double 
blind trial, of whom 302 patients received Sycrest at fixed 
doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily. Study 
results showed statistically significant superiority for all 
three Sycrest doses in improving the Young Mania Rating 
Scale (YMRS) total score as measured by the change from 
baseline to Day 21, as compared with placebo. However, 
the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been 
established.  
No long term data are available with regard to the 
efficacy and the safety of asenapine in this population. The 
mean change from baseline to endpoint in weight for 
placebo and asenapine 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice 
daily, was 0.48, 1.72, 1.62, and 1.44 kg, respectively. The 
proportion of subjects with clinically significant weight gain 
(≥ 7 % weight gain from baseline at endpoint) was 14.1 % 
for asenapine 2.5 mg twice daily, 8.9 % for asenapine 5 mg 
twice daily, and 9.2 % for asenapine 10 mg twice daily, 
compared to 1.1 % for placebo. 
Efficacy of Sycrest was not demonstrated in an 8 
week, placebo controlled, double blind, randomized, fixed 
dose trial in 306 adolescent patients aged 12 17 years with 
schizophrenia at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily. 
The clinically relevant adverse experiences identified in the 
paediatric bipolar and schizophrenia trials were similar to 
those observed in adult bipolar and schizophrenia trials. 
Page 8/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common adverse reactions (≥5 % and at least 
twice the rate of placebo) reported in paediatric patients 
with bipolar I disorder were somnolence, sedation, 
dizziness, dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia oral, paraesthesia oral, 
nausea, increased appetite, fatigue, and weight increased. 
The most common adverse reactions (proportion of 
patients  5 % and at least twice placebo) reported in 
paediatric patients with schizophrenia were somnolence, 
sedation, akathisia, dizziness, and hypoaesthesia oral. 
There was a statistically significant higher incidence of 
patients with ≥7 % weight gain (from baseline to endpoint) 
compared to placebo (3.1 %) for Sycrest 2.5 mg twice daily 
(9.5 %) and Sycrest 5 mg twice daily (13.1 %).

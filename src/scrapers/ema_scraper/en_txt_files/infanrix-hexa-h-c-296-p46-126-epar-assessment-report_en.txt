2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 126 
The safety and immunogenicity of the GSK Biologicals’ 12-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 
non-typeable H. influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (12Pn-PDDiT- CRM) containing serotypes 6A 
and 19A in addition to the 10 Synflorix serotypes, has been assessed for the first time in the study 
SPNG-007 (115373). The results from SPNG-007 study showed that 12Pn-PD-DiT-CRM was 
immunogenic and well tolerated when administered as single dose in toddlers 12-23 months of age, 
previously primed with three doses of Synflorix. No clinical pattern that would suggest a clinical safety 
concern was found. 
This current study aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority of immune response to 11Pn-PDDiT- CRM and 
12Pn-PD-DiT-CRM vaccines respectively when compared to immune responses of the licensed vaccines 
and when administered as a 3-dose primary immunization course in healthy infants at 3, 4 and 5 
months of age and as a booster  vaccination at 12-15 months of age. Pfizer’s Prevenar 13 vaccine was 
used for the comparison of the immune response to the two additional pneumococcal serotypes 19A 
and/or 6A conjugated to CRM197 and GSK Biologicals’ Synflorix was used for the comparison of the 
immune response to the 10 common pneumococcal serotypes. Evaluation of the safety of 11Pn-PD-
DiT-CRM and 12Pn-PD-DiT-CRM vaccines was also performed in the study. 
Summary of the study design 
4 parallel groups were randomized. 
Duration of the study: approximately 11 to 14 months for each subject, depending on the age at the   
vaccination.

Safety summary of Results of the SPNG-009 after Primary vaccination 
During the 4-days post-vaccination period: 
Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE in each group (after 37.5%, 40.2%, 37.9% 
and 35.4% of doses in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 groups, respectively). The overall/dose 
incidence of grade 3 solicited local AEs ranged from 0.3% (redness in the Prev13 group) to 4.5% (pain 
in the 11Pn_I group).  
Table  Incidence of solicited general symptoms reported during the 4-day (Days 0-3) post-vaccination 
period followingeach dose and overall (Epoch 001) (Total vaccinated cohort) 
Irritability / fussiness was the most frequently reported solicited general AE in each group (after 
58.4%, 61.7%, 57.7% and 53.5% of doses in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 groups, 
respectively). Grade 3 solicited general AEs were reported following maximum 5.6% of doses in the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

11Pn_I and 12Pn_I groups (irritability in 11Pn_I group) and maximum 6.2% of doses in the control 
10Pn_I and Prev13 groups (irritability in the 10Pn_I group). Grade 3 solicited general AEs considered 
by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were reported following maximum 4.9% of 
doses in the 11Pn_I and 12Pn_I groups (irritability in the 11Pn_I group) and maximum 5.0% of doses 
in the control 10Pn_I and Prev13 groups (irritability in the 10Pn_I group). 
During the 31-days post-vaccination period: 
24.2%, 23.4%, 27.2% and 23.6% of doses in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 group, 
respectively were followed by at least one unsolicited AE. 
Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported after 2.1%, 1.4%, 1.2% and 0.8% of doses in the 11Pn_I, 
12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 group, respectively. Of these, three grade 3 AEs, two in the 12Pn_I group 
(both pyrexia) and one in the Prev13 group (vomiting), were considered by the investigator to be 
causally related to vaccination.  
Unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were reported for 
0.6%, 0.8%, 1.5% and 1.0% of doses in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 group, respectively).  
During the primary epoch (from dose 1 up to visit 4), at least one SAE was reported for 52 subjects: 
12 out of 240 (5.0%) vaccinated subjects in the 11Pn_I group, 11 out of 240 (4.6%) vaccinated 
subjects in the 12Pn_I group, 17 out of 230 (7.4%) vaccinated subjects in the 10Pn_I group and 12 
out of 241 (5.0%) vaccinated subjects in the Prev13 group. Of these, three SAEs were considered by 
the investigator to be causally related to vaccination, one in the 10Pn_I group (pyrexia) and two in the 
12Pn_I group (both pyrexia). All SAEs resolved without sequelae except one (chronic bronchitis, 
resolving).  
No fatal SAEs were reported during the primary epoch of the study (from dose 1 up to visit 4). There 
were no subjects withdrawn from the study due to a SAE. One subject was withdrawn due to a non-
serious adverse event not related to vaccination. 
Safety summary of Results of the SPNG-009 after Booster 
During the 4-day post-booster vaccination period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local 
symptom (reported for 47.7%, 54.9%, 54.3% and 47.6% of subjects in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I 
and Prev13 groups, respectively). The percentage of subjects with grade 3 solicited local symptom 
ranged from 2.1% (redness in the 11Pn_I group) to 8.2% (pain in the 10Pn_I group). Six large 
swelling reactions were reported after administration of the booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines (three in each of the 12Pn_I and 10Pn_I groups). 
During the 4-day post-booster vaccination period, irritability was the most frequently reported solicited 
general symptom (reported for 59.6%, 60.7%, 62.6% and 55.8% of subjects in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 
10Pn_I and Prev13 groups, respectively). The percentage of subjects reporting fever (a rectal 
temperature of ≥ 38.0°C) was 34.0%, 32.1 %, 31.1 5 and 32.5 % in 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and 
Prev13 groups, respectively. Grade 3 solicited general symptoms were reported for a maximum of 
6.3% of subjects (irritability in the 12Pn_I group). The percentage of subjects with solicited general 
symptom with causal relationship to vaccination (as assessed by the investigator) ranged from 19.5% 
(loss of appetite in the Prev13 group) to 52.2% (irritability in the 12Pn_I group).

During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period, at least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 
29.1%, 30.1%, 33.3% and 22.6% of subjects in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 groups, 
respectively. At least one unsolicited symptom with causal relationship to vaccination was reported for 
3.0%, 0.4%, 2.3% and 0.9% of subjects in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 groups, 
respectively. 
During the booster epoch (from booster dose up to study end), at least one SAE was reported for 11 
subjects: two subjects in the 11Pn_I group, three subjects in the 12Pn_I group, four subjects in the 
10Pn_I group and two subjects in the Prev13 group. Of these, one SAE in the 11Pn_I group (head 
injury) was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. All SAEs 
recovered/resolved. 
During the entire study period, at least one SAE was reported for 117 subjects: 29 subjects in the 
11Pn_I group, 26 subjects in the 12Pn_I group, 38 subjects in the 10Pn_I group and 24 subjects in the 
Prev13 group. Of these, four SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination. All SAEs recovered/resolved, except for three events (head injury (11Pn_I group) and 
three events of pyrexia (two in the 12Pn_I group and one in the 10Pn_I group). All SAEs 
recovered/resolved, except for three events: retinoblastoma in the 11Pn_I group, hypotonia in the 
10Pn_I group (both not recovered/not resolved) and pneumonia in the 12Pn_I group 
(recovered/resolved with sequelae). Please refer to the appendix for the narratives.

During the entire study period, one subject was withdrawn due to a non-serious AE (central hypotonic 
syndrome) and two subjects were withdrawn due to SAEs (conjunctivitis and retinoblastoma). 
Overall conclusion 
During the 31-day post-primary vaccination period, 24.2%, 23.4%, 27.2% and 23.6% of doses in the 
11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 group, respectively were followed by at least one unsolicited AE.  
During the primary epoch (from dose 1 up to visit 4), at least one SAE was reported for 52 subjects: 
12 out of 240 (5.0%) vaccinated subjects in the 11Pn_I group, 11 out of 240 (4.6%) vaccinated 
subjects in the 12Pn_I group, 17 out of 230 (7.4%) vaccinated subjects in the 10Pn_I group and 12 
out of 241 (5.0%) vaccinated subjects in the Prev13 group. Of these, three SAEs were considered by 
the investigator to be causally related to vaccination, one in the 10Pn_I group (pyrexia) and two in the 
12Pn_I group (both pyrexia). 
During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period, at least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 
29.1%, 30.1%, 33.3% and 22.6% of subjects in the 11Pn_I, 12Pn_I, 10Pn_I and Prev13 groups, 
respectively. 
During the booster epoch (from booster dose up to study end), at least one SAE was reported for 11 
subjects. Of these, one SAE in the 11Pn_I group (head injury) was assessed by the investigator to be 
causally related to vaccination. All SAEs recovered/resolved. 
During the entire study period, at least one SAE was reported for 117 subjects. Of these, four SAEs 
were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination: head injury (11Pn_I group) 
and three events of pyrexia (two in the 12Pn_I group and one in the 10Pn_I group). All SAEs 
recovered/resolved, except for three events: retinoblastoma in the 11Pn_I group, hypotonia in the 
10Pn_I group (both not recovered/not resolved) and pneumonia in the 12Pn_I group 
(recovered/resolved with sequelae). 
In this study, the 11Pn-PD-DiT-CRM and 12Pn-PD-DiT-CRM vaccines given as a booster dose to 
children of 12-15 months of age and co-administered with DTPa- HBV-IPV/Hib were generally well-
tolerated and induced immune responses to all vaccine antigens (i.e. pneumococcal serotype-specific

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The solicited/unsolicited AEs and SAEs – such as HHE and febrile convulsions - were addressed 
correctly in this study. 
In clinical studies in which some of the vaccines received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar 
(PCV7) as a booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 43.4% of infants 
receiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of infants receiving the 
hexavalent vaccine alone. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 2.6% and 1.5% of infants receiving Infanrix 
hexa with or without Prevenar, respectively. The incidence and severity of fever following co-

administration of the two vaccines in the primary series was lower than that observed after the booster 
dose.  
The physician should be aware that the rate of febrile reactions is higher when Infanrix hexa is co-
administered with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13) compared to that 
occurring following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were mostly moderate 
(less than or equal to 39°C) and transient. 
The results of this SPNG-009 study confirm and are consistent with the above results. The benefit/risk 
balance remains favourable and there is no need for further actions.

Case ID: - Serious Events: Hypotonia 
This female subject was enrolled in the partially blind study 116485 (SPNG-009).On she received 
the1st, 2nd, 3rd and booster dose of either 11-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide protein D 
conjugate vaccine (11Pn-PD-DiT-CRM), 12-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide protein D conjugate 
vaccine (12Pn-PD-DiT-CRM), 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide protein D conjugate vaccine 
(Synflorix) coadministered with combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, 
inactivated polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Infanrix hexa)., four months after the 3rd 
dose of Blinded vaccine, four months after the 3rd dose of Infanrix hexa, this eight-month-old subject 
developed hypotonia. The subject was hospitalised and the event was disabling. The event was 
unresolved at time of reporting. The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility 
that the hypotonia may have been caused by investigational product and Infanrix hexa. The time to 
onset is pointing at other causes, no relation with a GSK product suspected.  
Investigator Comments: Infant of 13 months derived from another hospital to study hypotonia (She 
was admitted on and discharged on). At 8 months is referred by her doctor to the other hospital for 
assessment of marked kyphoscoliosis and hypotonia (the patient was admitted on and she was 
discharged on). At that age does not get stable seating but head control (5 months) with 
predominantly distal hypotonia. On admission to study performs the following test: cranial MRI and 
column that are not pathological findings, blood chemistry (CPK 117 AST 40 ALT 16 LDH 256). EMG 
reported as systemic demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy (VCM 8,53 m/s) and genetic study 
espinal muscular atrophy with negative results. After making the initial study is derived to our hospital 
for further test and performing additional evidence if necessary ( genetic study). Comments The EMG 
is suggestive of peripheral motor neuropathy, but its just a sign, like hypotonia is a symptom. The final 
diagnosis remains unknown at this moment. Currently the patient has improved her clinical hypotonia, 
although it persists. Complementary studies have not been conclusive for a final diagnosis and 
continuous monitoring currently ongoing in our hospital. The time to onset is pointing at other causes, 
no relation with a GSK product suspected.

This female subject was enrolled in the partially blind study 116485 (SPNG-009). On and, she received 
the 1st and 2nd dose of Pfizer's 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar 13) co-administered with 
combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, inactivated polio, Haemophilus influenzae 
type b vaccine (Infanrix hexa). On 12 days after the 1st dose of Prevnar 13, 12 days after the 1st dose 
of Infanrix hexa, this two-month-old subject developed hypotonic crisis. The subject was hospitalised. 
The event resolved on  The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the 
hypotonic crisis may have been caused by Prevnar 13 and Infanrix hexa . 
Investigator Comments: Patient with two months of age was hospitalized on  due to a cerebral 
inhibition crisis in study. The subject had on episode of apnea 30 minutes before she arrival to the 
hospital. The duration of the episode was of 1 minute. The subject has no family history of neurological 
diseases. Her evolution has been favourable during the hospitalization. The subject was discharged on 
She will be subjected to a study of neurology. The patient has made brain ultrasound and a 
wakefulness and sleep EEG spontaneous that they have been normal. The neurologist will assess its 
evolution and raise apneas study if they recur. The patient is in good condition in the actuality. The 
event is a crisis of hypotonia during sleep. The testing was performed to reach this diagnosis. This 
event does not need treatment at present. 
Case ID: - Serious Events: Febrile convulsions 
On she received the 1st,2nd, 3rd and booster dose of Pfizer's 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine 
(Prevenar 13) co-administered with combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, 
inactivated polio, Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (Infanrix hexa). On30 days after the 4th dose 
of Prevnar 13, 30 days after the 4th dose of Infanrix hexa, this 13-month-old subject developed febrile 
convulsion. The subject was hospitalised. The subject was treated with paracetamol. The event 
resolved on  
The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the febrile convulsion may 
have been caused by Prevnar 13 and Infanrix hexa. This subject developed febrile convulsion 30 days 
after the 4th dose of Prevnar 13 (non GSK), 30 days after the 4th dose of Infanrix hexa. The 
convulsion was probably caused by the fever, a relation with Infanrix hexa is unlikely, although febrile 
convulsion is a listed event for the vaccine.

In the SmPC, different wordings address the increased risk of certain SAEs related to concomitant 
administration of Pneumococcal vaccine and Infanrix hexa. 
4.4 Warnings 
The physician should be aware that the rate of febrile reactions is higher when Infanrix hexa is co-
administered with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13), or with a measles-
mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, compared to that occurring following the administration of 
Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39°C) and transient 
(see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  
… 
If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis-
containing vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be 
carefully considered:

There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits 
outweigh possible risks. 
… 
Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) and hypotonic hyporesponsive episode 
(HHE) were observed with concomitant administration of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 (see section 
4.8). 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Infanrix hexa can be given concomitantly with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10 and 
PCV13), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (CRM197 and TT conjugates), meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (TT conjugate), oral rotavirus vaccine and measles-
mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine.  
Data have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual 
antigens, although inconsistent antibody response to poliovirus type 2 in co-administration with 
Synflorix was observed (seroprotection ranging from 78% to 100%) and the immune response rates to 
the PRP (Hib) antigen of Infanrix hexa after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were higher if co-
administered with a tetanus toxoid conjugate pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine (see section 
5.1). The clinical relevance of these observations remains unknown.  
4.8 Experience in co-administration: 
Analysis of post-marketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions (with or 
without fever) and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Infanrix hexa with Prevenar 13 
to those which reported use of Infanrix hexa alone. 
In clinical studies in which some of the vaccinees received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar 
(PCV7) as a booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 43.4% of infants 
receiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of infants receiving the 
hexavalent vaccine alone. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 2.6% and 1.5% of infants receiving Infanrix 
hexa with or without Prevenar, respectively (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The incidence and severity of 
fever following co-administration of the two vaccines in the primary series was lower than that 
observed after the booster dose. 
Data from clinical studies show similar incidences of fever when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with 
other pneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine.

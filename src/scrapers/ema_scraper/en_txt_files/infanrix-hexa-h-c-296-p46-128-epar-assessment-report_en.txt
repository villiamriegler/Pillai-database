2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure Article 46 
on DTPa-HBV-IPV-115 
A phase IV, open-label, multicentre study to assess the long-term persistence of antibodies against 
hepatitis B and the immunogenicity and safety of a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B 
Kinder SKF103860) in children aged 14-15 years, previously primed and boosted in the first two 
years of life with four doses of GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa SB217744) 
vaccine.  
The European Medicines Agency has requested GSK Biologicals to set up a long-term surveillance 
programme of vaccines containing a recombinant hepatitis B component. This study is the fourth in a 
series of four, constituting a common immunological follow-up program after vaccination with 
Infanrix hexa. The three previous studies in this series are mentioned below: 
•  106789 (DTPA-HBV-IPV-112): The study population was healthy subjects of 4-5 years of age 
at the time of enrolment, who had four consecutive doses of Infanrix hexa. The study report 
date is 04 December 2008. 
•  112688 (DTPA-HBV-IPV-113): The study population was healthy subjects of 7-8 years of age 
at the time of enrolment who had four consecutive doses of Infanrix hexa. The study report 
date is 28 March 2012 and the study report amendment 1 date is 24 February 2014. 
•  106793 (DTPA-HBV-IPV-114): The study was conducted in healthy subjects 12-13 years of 
age at the time of enrolment who received four consecutive doses of Infanrix hexa. The 
study report date is 17 August 2015.  
This study aimed to determine the persistence of immunity to hepatitis B, from childhood to 
adolescence that is conferred by four doses of vaccination with Infanrix hexa in the first 2 years of 
age. Persistent immunity to hepatitis B was assessed previously, in 4-5 years old, 7-8 years old and 
12-13 years old, respectively who were vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix hexa, as part of 
routine vaccination in infancy, in Germany. More than 60% of subjects showed seroprotective 
persistent antibody concentrations and at least 96% of subjects in all age groups showed an 
anamnestic response to the single hepatitis B challenge dose [Zinke, 2010, Steiner, 2010; Van Der 
Meeren, 2014; Behre, 2016]. The results observed in these studies are in line with the results 
observed when children and adolescents were primed with three doses of a monovalent hepatitis B 
vaccine [Van Der Meeren, 2016; Behre, 2012].  
Infanrix hexa was licensed for use in Germany in 2000.   Thus, children who received routine 
vaccination in the year 2001 with Infanrix hexa had reached the age of 14 to 15 years by 2016. 
These children were invited to participate in this study to collect persistence data for hepatitis B 
antibodies and to assess the anamnestic response, immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a 
single challenge dose of the hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B Kinder). 
Study Design 
A phase IV, open-label, multicentre study to assess the long-term persistence of antibodies against 
hepatitis B and the immunogenicity and safety of a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B 
Kinder SKF103860) in children aged 14-15 years, previously primed and boosted in the first two 
years of life with four doses of GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa SB217744) 
vaccine. A total of 302 subjects were vaccinated and all completed the study and 268 subjects were 
included in the ATP cohort for analysis of the immunogenicity. The persistence of anti-HBs antibody

concentrations in subjects 14-15 years of age previously vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix hexa 
in the first two years of life was evaluated in this study. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
• 
To assess the immunological response to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), in terms of 
antibody concentrations ≥100 mIU/mL, one month after the single challenge dose of the HBV 
vaccine in subjects 14-15 years of age, previously vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix 
hexa in the first two years of life. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the persistence of anti-HBs antibodies, in terms of seroprotection status and 
antibody concentrations, in subjects 14-15 years of age, previously vaccinated with four 
doses of Infanrix hexa in the first two years of life. 
To assess the immunological response to hepatitis B surface antigen, in terms of anamnestic 
response, one month after the single challenge dose of the HBV vaccine in subjects 14-15 
years of age, previously vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix hexa in the first two years of 
life. 
To assess the immunological response to the hepatitis B surface antigen, in terms of 
seroprotection status and antibody concentrations, one month after the single challenge dose 
of the HBV vaccine in subjects 14-15 years of age, previously vaccinated with four doses of 
Infanrix hexa in the first two years of life. 
Analysis of the study 
Immunogenicity results 
•  One month after the challenge dose of HBV vaccine, 87.3% of the subjects had anti-HBs 
antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/mL and the anti-HBs GMC was 1975.7 mIU/mL (95% CI: 
1436.1–2718.1). 
• 
Persisting seroprotective anti-HBs antibody concentrations (i.e. anti-HBs antibody 
concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL) were observed in 53.7% of the children aged 14 to 15 years 
who were vaccinated in infancy with four doses of Infanrix hexa in routine clinical practice. 
Refer to Table 1. 
•  One month after the challenge dose, 93.3% reached seroprotective anti-HBs antibody 
concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/ml. 
•  An anamnestic response to the hepatitis B challenge dose was mounted by 92.5% of the 
subjects.

Safety results 
•  Any Symptom: During the 4-day post-challenge dose follow-up period, at least one adverse 
event (solicited or unsolicited, local or general) was reported for 65.6% of the subjects. 
•  Solicited local symptoms: Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited 
local symptom (reported for 33.6% of the subjects) and also the only Grade 3 solicited local 
symptom reported at the injection site (reported for 1.0% of the subjects). 
•  Solicited general symptoms: Fatigue was the most frequently reported solicited general 
symptom (reported for 30.2% of the subjects). The most frequently reported Grade 3 
solicited general symptom was headache (reported for 4.3% of the subjects). 
•  Unsolicited adverse events: At least one unsolicited adverse event was reported for 18.2% of 
the subjects during the 31-day (Day 0-Day 30) follow up period. At least one unsolicited 
adverse event of Grade 3 intensity was reported for 2.3% of the subjects. The following 
unsolicited adverse events were considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination: dizziness (reported for 0.7 % of subjects) and injection site pruritus, malaise, 
pain and pain in extremity (each reported for 0.3% of subject).  
•  Serious adverse events: Two SAEs were reported during the study (meniscus injury and 
eating 
disorder). Neither of these SAEs was considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
the vaccination and both had resolved by the end of the study. No fatal SAEs were reported 
during the study. 
•  Withdrawals due to AEs /SAEs: None of the subjects were withdrawn from the study due to 
an AE or SAE during the entire study period. 
The Company concluded that these different results justify an update of the information on 
the persistence for protection in the PI as they may be relevant to the prescribers. No new 
safety issues.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The Rapporteur agrees and endorses the discussion. MS1 commented on the lower 
boosterability of the subjects than seen in previous studies (see below) and the 
Rapporteur endorses their comments. The MAH will submit a variation type II to update 
the SmPC with the Hepatitis B persistence of protection. No further actions are required 
and the PAM is considered fulfilled.  
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required 
MS1 comments 
MS1 endorse the conclusion of the rapporteur to submit a Type II variation regarding the persistence 
of Infanrix hexa.  
Nevertheless, MS1 would like to comment that the immune responses in the subjects after a booster 
dose with Engerix-B children around 14 years after the primary vaccination course were rather low. 
In previous studies the boosterability of the subjects was higher and one month after the challenge 
dose, around 100 % reached seroprotective levels anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/ml.

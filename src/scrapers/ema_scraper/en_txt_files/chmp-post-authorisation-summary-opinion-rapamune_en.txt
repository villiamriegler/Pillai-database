Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Rapamune 
sirolimus 
On 28 June 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Rapamune. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Pfizer Limited. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
"Rapamune is indicated for the treatment of patients with sporadic 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis with moderate lung disease or declining lung function (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1)"  
For information, the full indications for Rapamune will be as follows:2 
"Rapamune is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low to 
moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant. It is recommended that 
Rapamune be used initially in combination with ciclosporin microemulsion and 
corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months. Rapamune may be continued as maintenance therapy 
with corticosteroids only if ciclosporin microemulsion can be progressively discontinued 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Rapamune is indicated for the treatment of patients with sporadic 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis with moderate lung disease or declining lung function 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1)." 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment 
report (EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this 
change to the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

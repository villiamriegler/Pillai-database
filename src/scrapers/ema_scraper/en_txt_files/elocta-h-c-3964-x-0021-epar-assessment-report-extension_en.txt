discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting 
an extension to the marketing authorisation for ELOCTA on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
With this extension application, the company applied for the introduction of three new strengths of 
Elocta, i.e. 4000 IU, 5000 IU and 6000 IU in addition to the existing strengths (250/ 500/ 750/ 1000/ 
1500/ 2000/ 3000 IU, MA numbers:  EU/1/15/1046/001-007).  
The extension application is primarily based on quality data. Following no changes in dose, the clinical 
part of the submitted dossier only contains a PK study that shows comparable PK properties over the 
full range of vial strengths. No pre-clinical documentation is deemed necessary. 
Elocta is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). Elocta can be used for all age groups. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective 
because inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both 
spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes 
upon injury. Rarely, life-threatening bleeding may also occur. Patients exhibit variable clinical 
phenotypes depending on the extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient FVIII that is used to 
classify the disease severity (WFH, 2012): 
• 
• 
• 
<1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The overall reported number of haemophilia A patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the World 
Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/697649/2018  
Page 7/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identified 140,313 people with haemophilia A (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). There are currently 
approximately 30,000 patients in the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
10,000. 
Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family 
history and a carrier mother. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; 
their disease is presumably caused by new mutations. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, 
factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated 
factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot 
can be formed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Haemophilia A manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can lead to 
chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (Bolton-Maggs and Pasi, 2003). The majority of bleeding 
occurs internally into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. 
Serious bleeds also occur in muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and 
forearm, and in the mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. Less 
frequently, life threatening bleeds can occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the 
gastrointestinal system or enclosed areas like the intracranial or intracerebral spaces. The approximate 
frequencies of bleeds at the different sites are: 70 to 80% in joints (haemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in 
muscle, 5 to 10% in the central nervous system, and < 5% for bleeds at all other sites (Srivastava et 
al., 2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of 
clotting factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of 
comprehensive haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction 
of home treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled 
patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life.

About the product 
rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein composed of a single molecule of human B-domain deleted 
Factor VIII fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). 
The rFVIIIFc drug product is a sterile lyophilized powder for solution for injection for intravenous 
administration. It is supplied in aseptically filled single use vials in multiple nominal strengths from 250 
to 6000 IU/vial. Prior to lyophilization, the nominal fill volume of all rFVIIIFc drug product strengths is 
2 mL. The composition prior to lyophilization is the same for all dosage strengths; only the quantity of 
rFVIIIFc active ingredient varies. The lyophilized powder is reconstituted with nominal 3 mL sterilised 
water for injections (SWFI) supplied in a sterile prefilled syringe.  
The rFVIIIFc drug product vial and pre-filled diluent (SWFI) syringe are packaged in a product pack 
with a plunger rod, a vial adaptor for reconstitution, an infusion set, alcohol swabs, plasters and gauze 
pad. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is an application for a change of an existing marketing authorization leading to an extension as 
referred to in ANNEX 1 of Regulation (EC) No. 1234, 2008 - Addition of a new strength. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Elocta  is  a  coagulation  factor  VIII  Fc  (rFVIIIFc,  INN  efmoroctocog  alfa),  a  recombinant  fusion  protein 
comprising  B-domain  deleted  (BDD)  human  FVIII  covalently  linked  to  the  Fc  domain  of  human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).  
This is an extension application for the MA for Elocta to include three more vial strengths of 4000 IU, 
5000 IU and 6000 IU. The production of vials of higher strengths, comprises a larger amount of active 
substance (AS) solution filled into each vial whilst maintaining the excipient content in line with the 
existing EU approved strengths of this product. The recommended prophylactic dosing of 50 IU/kg 
body weight of Elocta does not change. 
Data for these additional strengths (4000, 5000 and 6000 IU/vial) with the same formulation and using 
the same manufacturing process were already included and had been assessed during variation 
EMEA/H/C/003964/II/012/G submission. They served as supportive data for the establishment of the 
additional production site. 
Therefore, with respect to the quality assessment of the additional strengths 4000 IU, 5000 IU, 6000 
IU, in some sections of the report below, reference is made to the final AR of variation II/012/G.  
The finished product (FP) is presented as a powder and solvent for solution for injection containing in 
total, 10 different strengths ranging from 250 IU/vial to 6000 IU/vial (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 
2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000 IU/vial). 
Other ingredients are: sucrose, sodium chloride, L-Histidine, calcium chloride dihydrate, polysorbate 
20, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and water.

The product is available in a package containing: powder in a type 1 glass vial with a latex-free 
chlorobutyl rubber stopper, 3 mL solvent in a type 1 glass pre-filled syringe with a latex-free 
bromobutyl rubber plunger stopper, a plunger rod, a sterile vial adapter for reconstitution, a sterile 
infusion set, two alcohol swabs, two plasters and one gauze pad. All device components included in the 
final package are CE marked. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
rFVIIIFc is produced in stably transfected HEK293 cells. rFVIIIFc is a fully recombinant fusion protein 
consisting of a single molecule of B-domain deleted human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) fused to the 
Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with no intervening linker sequence. 
The AS of Elocta, efmoroctocog alfa, is a recombinant human coagulation factor VIII, Fc fusion protein 
(rFVIIIFc) comprising B-domain deleted (BDD) human FVIII covalently linked to the Fc domain of 
human immunoglobulin G1(IgG1). It has been developed as a long-acting version of recombinant FVIII 
(rFVIII).

With this Line Extension there are no changes to the currently approved manufacture, process controls 
and characterisation of the AS.  
Specification 
With this Line Extension there are no changes to the currently approved specification, analytical 
procedures, reference standards and container closure of the AS.  
Stability 
The currently approved stability of the AS remains unchanged.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The composition of Elocta 4000, 5000 and 6000 IU/vial is presented in Table 1 below. The excipient

The rFVIIIFc FP is a sterile, lyophilized powder for solution for injection intended for intravenous 
administration, manufactured using AS from the approved process in the approved sites. It is supplied 
in aseptically filled single use vials in ten nominal strengths (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 
4000, 5000 and 6000 IU/vial).  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the FP formulation.  
The recommended prophylactic dosing of 50 IU/kg body weight of Elocta does not change however, 
the new 6000 IU strength has been studied in clinical studies.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The initial FP development included strengths up to 3000 IU/vial. Three new strengths (4000, 5000 
and 6000 IU/vial) have now been developed. The product quality of the higher strengths was 
confirmed by FP technical runs, comparability testing and GMP manufacturing. 
The FP manufacturing process has been sequentially developed to produce the different nominal 
strengths, and to achieve process consistency independent of the final strength.  
Due to commercial needs a subsequent, alternative manufacturing site was identified to allow for 
transfer of the commercial process and introduction of additional strengths of 4000, 5000 and 6000 
IU/vial. FP transfer to the new site has been approved II/012/G). Assessment of the FP processes for 
rFVIIIFc at both sites revealed that all the major unit operations remain the same. The main difference 
between the two processes is the size of the lyophilizer and the introduction of additional higher 
strength FP. Accordingly, these changes resulted in the need for further technical evaluation in 
technical runs. As part of the comparability protocol, strategies were planned to compare 250 and 
3000 FP manufactured at both sites.  
The acceptance criteria applied to the technical runs at the new site was guided by ranges established 
for the existing commercial process at the existing site. Qualification data for a suitable number of lots 
were also submitted.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
There are no changes to the approved manufacturers with this line extension submission.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
There are no changes to the manufacturing process description with this submission. Relevant data on 
the manufacturing process had already been submitted and were approved during variation II/012/G. 
The batch formula is amended for the 4000, 5000 and 6000 IU/vial strengths. Regarding the controls 
of critical steps and intermediates there are no changes to this section. It was demonstrated during 
variation II/012/G that the process is controlled with comparable stringency at both production sites. 
Mostly, identical acceptance limits and hold times are specified. These are based on validation studies 
and media fill runs have been conducted for each site separately. 
No new validation documents are submitted with this line extension submission. During variation 
II/012/G the applicant provided data from 9 process validation (PV) runs. The PV approach also 
covered the lower and upper freeze drier load capacity in a matrix approach; also process-challenging 
conditions were applied. The bracketing and matrix approach was considered in line with process 
validation guidance and acceptable. The PV data demonstrated that the process is under good control, 
meeting pre-defined acceptance limits for all process controls and quality attributes analysed during 
the process. In conclusion, the manufacturing process has been validated for all dosage sizes from 250 
to 6000 IU/vial in line with process validation guidance documents. 
Product specification 
The product specification is updated and includes the protein concentration and the FVIII: chromogenic 
activity acceptance ranges for the additional strengths. The section ‘Justification of Specifications’ is 
amended accordingly. The release limits for the new strengths (potency) are the same as for the 
approved strengths. The finished product specification includes appropriate tests for identity, purity 
and potency. 
Analytical methods 
There are no changes to analytical procedures in this line extension. 
Batch analysis 
Batch release results of 11 lots of FP including the process validation run (PVR) lots were already 
presented during variation II/012/G. All lots met the release specification valid at the time of 
manufacture. No new batch release data are included in this line extension application.  
Reference materials 
There is no update of this section. The currently approved reference standards are also used at the 
new site. 
Container closure system  
The rFVIIIFc FP is provided in multiple nominal strengths. All strengths use the same container closure 
system for all product contact packaging components. The rFVIIIFc FP is lyophilized in a USP/Ph. Eur. 
Type I glass vial. The 10mL vial is closed with a 20 mm chlorobutyl rubber stopper. After the 
lyophilization process is complete, the stoppered vials are sealed with 20 mm aluminum seals with a 
polypropylene flip-off cap, of various colors, dependent on vial strength.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for the FP is 48 months (4 years) when stored at 2-8 °C. During the shelf-life, 
the product is proposed to be stored at room temperature (up to 30°C) for a single period not 
exceeding 6 months. After storage at room temperature, the product may not be returned to the 
refrigerator. 
In line with ICH Q 5C, a bracketing approach has been applied to study the stability of FP 
manufactured at the new site. The same release testing parameters as established for FP from the 
existing site are applied, which included stability indicating parameters. The process validation run 
(PVR) batches were monitored on stability. See Table 2 below.

All PVR batches were enrolled on stability. All formulations, fill volumes and container closure systems 
are the same across all strengths (250 to 6000 IU/vial) except for the quantity of protein filled in the 
vial to meet the target potency claim.  
The stability data acquired to date include forty-eight (48) month data for lyophilized rFVIIIFc FP for 
the 250 to 3000 IU/vial strengths when stored at 2 to 8°C. Within the 48-month period, storage of up 
to 6 months at room temperature (not to exceed 30°C) was evaluated. The stability for the new site 
PVR lots indicate that there is highly similar stability behaviour over all dosage sizes, including the 
higher strengths. Stability of the new strengths (4000, 5000 and 6000 IU/vial) is supported by the 
comparability evaluated between the FP manufacturing process development at the two production 
sites and comparable stability profiles presented. This includes comparable stability profiles through at 
least 12 months at 5±3°C, through 12 months at 30±2°C/75±5% RH, and through 6 months at 
40±2°C/75±5% RH. Accordingly a shelf life of 48 month for the 4000 to 6000 IU/vial strengths is 
accepted.  
In line with ICH Q5C, photo-stability studies were performed which indicated that the lyophilised 
product is light sensitive, requiring proper storage of the product in its outer carton. In-use stability of 
the reconstituted rFVIIIFc FP has been assessed. The results demonstrate that reconstituted rFVIIIFc 
FP (250 to 3000 IU/vial) is stable at ambient temperature (30 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% relative humidity) for up 
to 6 hours in the FP vial, the glass diluent syringe, or the polypropylene pooling syringe. These studies 
are suitable to support the in-use stability of the new strengths. 
The post-approval stability protocol includes lots of all strengths manufactured at the new site. In use 
stability will be tested for one 250 IU and one 6000 IU lot aged 42 month at 5°C, then moved to 30°C 
for a further 6 months. In conclusion, the proposed shelf life for the FP of 48 months (4 years) when 
stored at 2-8 °C is accepted. During the shelf-life, the product may be stored at room temperature (up 
to 30°C) for a single period not exceeding 6 months. After storage at room temperature, the product 
may not be returned to the refrigerator.

Adventitious agents 
The manufacture of the AS has not been changed for the line extension. No material of direct animal 
origin was used as a FP excipient.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The FP is manufactured at two sites using highly similar processes that have been validated 
independently and operate reproducibly within established parameters, leading to a product that meets 
preset quality attributes. The process at the new site has been validated for all strengths, including the 
new strengths. An adequate set of parameters has been established based on a risk analysis to control 
the quality of the FP. Based on available stability data, the currently approved shelf life of the FP of 48 
month at 5°C with up to 6 months at room temperature (up to 30°C) can also be accepted for FP lots 
of the new strengths manufactured at the new site.  
In conclusion, from a quality point of view the new strengths of 4000 IU/vial, 5000 IU/vial and 6000 
IU/vial can be approved, 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical data were submitted with this application.

Methods  
Figure 1 
Study Participants  
Study participants were male patients with severe haemophilia A, defined as <1 IU/dL (<1%) 
endogenous FVIII as determined by one-stage clotting assay from the central laboratory at Screening. 
Patients were to be ≥ 12 years old at the time of informed consent, and weighing at least 40 kg. 
Patients were to be previously treated subjects, defined as having at least 150 documented prior EDs 
to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FVIII and/or cryoprecipitate products at Day 1. Patients 
were not eligible in case they do have a history of a positive inhibitor test or clinical signs of decreased 
response to FVIII administrations. Further, patients were not enrolled in case they had measurable 
inhibitor activity using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay (≥ 0.6 BU/mL was considered positive) 
at screening. 
Treatments 
The PK assessments were performed following a single dose of rFVIIIFc, as follows: 
PK1: 2K rFVIIIFc, 1000 IU/vial, 50 IU/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/697649/2018  
Page 15/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
PK2 and PK3: 
o  Group 1 received 15K rFVIIIFc, 1000 IU/vial, 50 IU/kg for both assessments. 
o  Group 2 received 15K rFVIIIFc, 6000 IU/vial, 50 IU/kg for both assessments. 
After completing the PK2 assessment, all subjects (whether or not evaluable for PK) began receiving 
treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc exclusively (see Figure 1). Subjects received prophylactic dosing. The 
specific choice of regimen for any given subject and any subsequent dose adjustments was based on 
the subject’s response and was at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Recommended starting dosing regimens included the following: 
•  A prophylactic regimen at a starting dose of 50 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc given every 3 to 5 days. Fur-
ther dose and interval adjustments were based on individual clinical response per Investiga-tor’s 
discretion. Dosing could be adjusted in the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg at 3- to 5-day inter-vals. 
•  A prophylactic regimen of 65 IU/kg administered every 7 days was considered for appropriate 
subjects who were selected based on the opinion of the Investigator. 
Subjects were allowed to switch from 1 regimen to another if approved by the Investigator and were 
allowed to use any of the several available vial strengths. 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the current 
scale of 2000 L (2K) to the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15,000 L (15K) scale in previously 
treated subjects with severe haemophilia A. 
Secondary Objectives 
Secondary objectives were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
To characterise the PK of 15K rFVIIIFc at the 15K baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment 
To characterise the PK of 15K rFVIIIFc at 1000 and 6000 IU/vial strengths 
To evaluate the safety of 15K rFVIIIFc 
Outcomes/endpoints

Secondary: 
The secondary endpoints included the following: 
• 
PK parameters, including but not be limited to AUCinf, IR, Cmax, t½, CL, volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss), and mean residence time (MRT). PK was assessed using the aPTT clot-ting 
assay and the two-stage chromogenic assay. 
o  PK parameters were assessed for the following 
•  15K rFVIIIFc at the 15K baseline (i.e., at PK2) and after 13 weeks of treatment (at PK assessment 
3, with 15K rFVIIIFc [PK3]) 
•  15K rFVIIIFc at 1000 and 6000 IU/vial strengths 
•  2K rFVIIIFc (at PK1) and 15K rFVIIIFc (at PK2) (except AUCinf and IR, which are includ-ed in the 
primary endpoint) 
•  Development of inhibitors as measured by the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay 
•  Evaluation of AEs and SAEs 
Sample size 
A total of 24 male subjects were enrolled and included in the All-Enrolled Analysis Set; of these 23 
subjects completed the study. One subject in the 15K 6000 IU/vial cohort was discontinued before the 
PK2 assessment due to reason marked other (the subject was unable to complete the washout period 
due to breakthrough bleeding). 
Patient group who received at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc (2K) comprised of 24 subjects. Patient group 
who received at least 1 dose of 15K rFVIIIFc comprised of 23 subjects: 11 subjects in the 15K 1000 
IU/vial and 12 subjects in the 15K 6000 IU/vial cohort. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized on Day 1 of PK1 via the Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IXRS) in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1000 IU/kg or 6000 IU/kg of 15K rFVIIIFc (a single IV injection of 50 
IU/kg) in the subsequent PK2 and PK3 assessments. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
PK analysis was based on the PK analysis set, which included all eligible subjects who received at least 
1 dose of rFVIIIFc and had sufficient PK data points to calculate all PK parameters for a given injection 
in at least 1 of the 2 assays for any of the PK assessments. 
Noncompartmental analysis was implemented in all subjects with sufficient data to estimate at least 1 
PK parameter and was conducted for FVIII activity data from both the one-stage clotting and two-
stage chromogenic assays. Noncompartmental analysis was performed on FVIII activity vs. time data

that were obtained following the i.v. infusion and adjusted for baseline and residual activity from prior 
therapy. 
Descriptive statistics were presented for all PK parameters. Only completed subjects and evaluable PK 
profiles were included in the summary. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 24 male subjects were enrolled and of these 23 subjects completed the study. One subject in 
the 15K 6000 IU/vial cohort was discontinued before the PK2 assessment due to reason marked other 
(the subject was unable to complete the washout period due to breakthrough bleeding). 
Patients who received at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc (2K) comprised of 24 subjects. Patients who received 
at least 1 dose of 15K rFVIIIFc comprised of 23 subjects: 11 subjects in the 15K 1000 IU/vial and 12 
subjects in the 15K 6000 IU/vial cohort. 
Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
A washout period with no FVIII treatment was required prior to each injection of rFVIIIFc for all PK 
assessments (96 hours for short-acting products or 120 hours for long-acting products). 
PK sampling occurred predose and at 7 timepoints postinjection: 0.5 hour (±5 minutes); 1 hour and 6 
hours (±10 minutes); and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours (±60 minutes). 
Baseline data 
All subjects were male. The median overall age was 30 years (range: 13 to 62 years). The majority of 
subjects were in the 18 to 64 years of age category (n=22). The median weight was 75.95 kg (range: 
45.4 to 129.0 kg), and the median BMI was 25.29 kg/m2 (range: 17.5 to 39.6 kg/m2). Race was not 
reported for 70.8% of subjects owing to local confidentiality requirements. Of the remaining subjects, 
16.7% were white, 8.3% were black or African American, and 4.2% were Asian. The majority of sub-
jects (70.8%) did not report ethnicity due to local confidentiality regulations. The main geographic 
area represented was Other (Australia and New Zealand) (70.8%).

Concordance was high between the PK parameters for the drug product administered from the 2 
manufacturing scales, and the PK profiles for the 15K and 2K manufacturing scales were comparable 
with considerable overlap of the SE bars (see Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Mean (±SE) FVIII activity over time following rFVIIIFc dosing by pharmacokinetic 
assessments and manufacturing scales; one-stage clotting assay (linear scale) 
(Pharmacokinetic analysis set) 
The ratios of adjusted geometric mean of the 15K relative to the 2K manufacturing scale were close to 
1 suggesting similar PK, with estimates of 1.08 (90 % CI: 0.93, 1.24) and 1.01 (90 % CI: 0.87, 1.16) 
for the primary parameters AUCinf and IR, respectively (Table 3). These CIs fell within the range of 
0.68 to 1.46, and thus met the predefined measure of comparability as specified in the study protocol 
and SAP.

Overall, the PK profile displayed a two-compartmental behavior with a rapid distribution phase for the 
first 6 hours, followed by slower elimination of FVIII activity over the remainder of the profile. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed for the subjects who had evaluable AUCinf and IR for both PK1 
and PK2 assessments. The results of the sensitivity analysis supported the primary analysis results, 
with almost identical estimates. 
The PK conclusions from the one-stage clotting assay were supported by the results from the two-
stage chromogenic assay. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary PK parameters (Cmax, t1/2, CL, Vss, and MRT) showed similar results to the primary 
parameters. The time-related parameters, t1/2 and MRT, showed a high level of consistency between 
the 2 manufacturing scales with the ratio of the adjusted geometric mean of 1.00 with narrow 90 % 
CI. The geometric mean ratios for the CL and Vss estimates were also well within the prespecified CI 
limit. 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics across 15K rFVIIIFc at baseline (PK2) and after 13 weeks of treatment 
(PK3) 
Overall, the key PK parameters were comparable across 15K rFVIIIFc at baseline (PK2) and after 13 
weeks of treatment (PK3) for the individual 1000 and 6000 IU as well as the combined 1000/6000 IU 
vial strengths. 
For the 1000 and 6000 IU combined results, the geometric mean estimate for AUCinf for the PK2 as-
sessment was 2448.6 IU·h/dL (95 % CI: 2089.0, 2870.1), compared with 2697.8 IU·h/dL (95 % CI: 
2295.1, 3171.0) for PK3, and the geometric mean estimate for IR was 2.693 (95 % CI: 2.429, 2.986) 
and 2.804 IU/dL per IU/kg (95 % CI: 2.588, 3.038) for PK2 and PK3, respectively. The 2 parameters 
were comparable, given the considerable overlap in the 95 % CIs. 
Similarly, the geometric means estimates for the time-related parameters, t½ and MRT, and the CL 
and Vss were also comparable between PK2 and PK3. 
Similar trends were observed for the PK2 vs. PK3 assessments at the individual 1000 and 6000 IU vial 
strengths with comparable mean PK estimates and overlapping CIs between the baseline and repeat 
PK assessments. 
The individual and combined results confirm that the PK profile is stable over 13 weeks of treatment, 
with the time course of activity consistent with and predictable from the first dose activity profile. 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics across 15K rFVIIIFc vial strengths 
Overall, the kinetics of rFVIIIFc across 15K rFVIIIFc vial strengths (1000 and 6000 IU/vial) were con-
sistent, and the 2 strengths showed comparable PK profiles that were consistent with the typical pro-
files displayed by the product (see Figure 3 below).

Figure 3: Mean (±SE) FVIII activity over time following 15K rFVIIIFc dosing by 
pharmaco-kinetic assessments and vial strengths; one-stage clotting assay (linear 
scale) (Pharmaco-kinetic analysis set) 
For the PK2 assessment, the geometric mean estimate for AUCinf for the 1000 IU vial strength was 
2356.8 IU·h/dL (95 % CI: 1950.4, 2847.9), compared with 2535.8 IU·h/dL (95 % CI: 1915.6, 3356.8) 
for the 6000 IU vial strength, and the geometric mean estimate for IR was 2.614 (95 % CI: 2.186, 
3.126) and 2.768 IU/dL per IU/kg (95 % CI: 2.408, 3.181) for the 1000 and 6000 IU strengths, re-
spectively. The 2 parameters were comparable, given the considerable overlap in the 95 % CIs. 
The geometric means estimates for the time-related parameters, t½ and MRT, as well as CL and Vss 
were also similar between the 1000 and 6000 IU vial strengths. 
The PK3 assessment also showed similar results across the 1000 and 6000 IU vial strengths with com-
parable parameter estimates and a high level of overlap in the 95 % CI. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In order to support the applied line extension the MAH presented data from one PK study in which low 
versus high concentrated product has been compared but also 2K versus upscaled 15K product. 
Furthermore, PK of 15K product at baseline was compared to PK after 13 weeks of treatment. 
In brief, the PK parameters across the 15K rFVIIIFc 1000 and 6000 IU vial strengths were similar. 
Furthermore, PK parameters across 15K rFVIIIFc at baseline (PK2) and after 13 weeks of treatment 
(PK3) confirm a similar time course of activity. In terms of overall comparison of 2K versus 15K 
material the presented data show comparable PK profiles. 
Overall, the data are considered adequate to support the requested line extension. However, there was 
one issue identified to be addressed prior to final conclusion, i.e. a PK sub-analysis of patients who 
received 2K 1000 IU/vial product and then the 15k 1000 IU/vial. Subsequently the applicant provided 
Assessment report

this sub-analysis. In brief, it was agreed that the results are consistent with the analyses on the total 
population. Thus, no difference between 2K and 15k material is detected. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the data are considered adequate to support the requested line extension.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The Safety Analysis Set included 24 subjects who received at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc (2K or 15K). 
Among the 23 subjects exposed to 15K rFVIIIFc, 23 subjects (100%) received rFVIIIFc during the 
study for at least 13 weeks and 15 subjects (65.2%) received rFVIIIFc during the study for at least 26 
weeks. 
Adverse events 
During 15K rFVIIIFc treatment, 23 subjects received at least 1 dose of 15K rFVIIIFc, of which, 10 
subjects (43.5%) experienced a total of 17 TEAEs. One subject experienced an AE that was considered 
by the Investigator as related to 15K rFVIIIFc treatment (PT: increase in alanine aminotransferase 
[ALT]). 
During the 2K rFVIIIFc treatment, 24 subjects received at least 1 dose of 2K rFVIIIFc, of which, 3 
subjects (12.5%) experienced a total of 4 TEAEs. One subject experienced an AE that was considered 
by the Investigator as related to 2K rFVIIIFc treatment (PT: altered taste). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths reported in the study. There were no TESAEs in this study. One subject 
experienced an AE of head injury that was considered severe; otherwise, all AEs during the study were 
mild or moderate. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no unusual pattern was observed in the shifts in laboratory data from baseline to values 
outside normal range in the noted hematology or chemistry parameters. No abnormalities reached 
potentially clinically significant elevated values and no AEs were reported for these subjects. 
Immunological events 
All  24  subjects  in  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  had  inhibitor  testing  performed.  No  subjects  developed  a 
positive inhibitor to FVIII during the study. 
Two of 24 subjects tested positive for anti-rFVIIIFc  prior to receiving the first dose of rFVIIIFc in this 
study.  Neither  subject  had  been  previously  exposed  to  rFVIIIFc.  One  of  these  subjects  had  no 
subsequent  positive  measurements.  The  other  subject  who  was  positive  for  anti-rFVIIIFc  prior  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/697649/2018  
Page 22/27 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment also had positive tests at PK1 and PK2 assessments but was negative at the PK3 assessment 
and  final  study  visit.  One  subject  tested  positive  for  anti-rFVIIIFc  at  the  PK3  assessment,  and  was 
negative for all other assessments and negative at the final study visit. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subject discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study due to an AE. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The safety profile of rFVIIIFc was assessed in 23 subjects who received 15K rFVIIIFc and 24 subjects 
who received 2K rFVIIIFc. While 2K rFVIIIFc was applied only once, i.e. for the PK, the exposure to 
15K rFVIIIFc occurred over a period of up to 32 weeks (median 26 weeks). 
The results showed that rFVIIIFc was well tolerated. No positive inhibitors to rFVIIIFc were detected in 
any subject. There were no deaths reported during the study. No subject discontinued treatment or 
withdrew from the study due to an AE. No subject presented a TESAE in this study. 
For 15K rFVIIIFc, the most common TEAE reported was headache (3 subjects); all other TEAEs during 
treatment were experienced by no more than 1 subject. Most AEs observed in the study were assessed 
as mild or moderate by the Investigator. There were no unique safety concerns identified for the 15K 
rFVIIIFc manufacturing scale. 
The relevance of the single adverse event of PT alanine aminotransferase increased (which was judged 
as possibly related by the investigator) has been discussed with the applicant. The subject concerned 
has a history of transient ALT elevations combined with a medical history of iron deficiency anemia, 
chronic hemophilic arthropathy and muscle wasting. In consequence, it was agreed to the applicant 
that there is not enough evidence to support a causal association between the ALT increase and 
treatment with Elocta. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, overall application of Elocta was well tolerated and revealed no serious safety concerns.

2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
No  new  risks  have  been  identified  for  Elocta  4000  IU,  5000  IU  and  6000  IU  applied  for  in  this  line 
extension application.  
Therefore, no revised RMP was provided as part of this application. The RMP version 2.0 remains the 
last authorised version. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Elocta. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Elocta (efmoroctocog alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective 
because inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both 
spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes 
upon injury. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of 
clotting factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of 
comprehensive haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction 
of home treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled 
patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This line extension intends to include three additional vial strengths (i.e. 4000 IU, 5000 IU and 6000 
IU).  
To support this application results from one PK clinical study (study 997HA309) are presented which 
was designed: (1) to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 
15,000 L (15K) scale relative to the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the current scale (2000 L; 2K), (2) 
to characterise the PK of 15K rFVIIIFc in 6000 international unit (IU) vials (the highest vial strength) 
versus the lower, 1000 IU vial strength, and (3) to provide 26 weeks of safety data on 15K rFVIIIFc. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The PK parameters across the 1000 IU and 6000 IU vial strengths were similar. Furthermore, PK 
parameters across 15K rFVIIIFc at baseline (PK2) and after 13 weeks of treatment (PK3) confirm a 
similar time course of activity. In terms of comparison of 2K versus 15K material the presented data 
show comparable PK profiles. 
Overall, the PK data are considered adequate to support the requested line extension.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Not applicable. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of rFVIIIFc was assessed in 23 subjects who received 15K rFVIIIFc and 24 subjects 
who received 2K rFVIIIFc. While 2K rFVIIIFc was applied only once, i.e. for the PK, the exposure to 
15K rFVIIIFc occurred over a period of up to 32 weeks (median 26 weeks). 
The results showed that rFVIIIFc was well tolerated. No positive inhibitors to FVIII were detected in 
any subject. There were no deaths reported during the study. No subject discontinued treatment or 
withdrew from the study due to an AE. No subject presented a TESAE in this study.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The PK parameters across the 1000 IU and 6000 IU vial strengths were similar. The results showed 
that rFVIIIFc was well tolerated. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit risk assessment for Elocta remains positive. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Elocta is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Elocta 4000 IU, 5000 IU and 6000 IU new strengths is favourable in 
the following indication:

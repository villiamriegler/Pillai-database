1.  Introduction 
On  12/02/2018,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  SUTENT  (A6181196),  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  single-arm,  multi-center,  multi-national,  Phase  I/II  clinical  trial  A6181196 
evaluating  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  preliminary  anti-tumour  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in 
children  and  young  adults  diagnosed  with  advanced  unresectable  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour 
(GIST) is currently included in the approved sunitinib Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP).  
Considering that the PIP for sunitinib is still ongoing, the MAH does not consider that a change in the 
Sutent Product Information is warranted at this stage. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In the Study A6181196 sunitinib malate study medication was  supplied to the clinic pharmacy as hard 
gelatin capsules in HDPE bottles containing 28 or 30 capsules for oral administration. Sunitinib malate 
capsules contained 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg equivalents of sunitinib free-base.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the final Clinical Study Report for Study A6181196: A Phase I/II Study of Sunitinib 
In Young Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour.

Secondary Objectives 
• To investigate whether doses greater than the established pediatric maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
were tolerated in pediatric patients with GIST; 
• To investigate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib in children and young adults with GIST; 
• To investigate the anti-tumor activity of sunitinib in children and young adults with GIST; 
•  To  explore  pharmacokinetic  (PK)–pharmacodynamic  (PD)  relationships  with  respect  to  safety  and 
efficacy in children and young adults with GIST. 
Study design 
This  was  a  single  arm,  multi-center,  multi-national,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial  evaluating  the  PK,  safety, 
and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of sunitinib in children and young adults diagnosed with advanced, 
unresectable GIST. 
Study population /Sample size 
Protocol  Amendment  2  (see  Section  9.8.2)  was  implemented  to reduce  the  sample  size  to  6  patients 
from  the  originally  planned  15  patients  because  of  the  rarity  of  the  disease  and  the  difficulties  in 
identifying  pediatric  patients  suitable  for  participation  in  the  study.  The  revised  sample  size  was 
expected to still allow characterization of the PK profile, ie, analysis of the primary endpoint. 
The originally planned sample size calculations were as follows. Assuming the coefficient of variation of 
sunitinib clearance among pediatric patients is approximately 35%, a total of 15 patients would allow 
detection  of  a  35%  margin  of  error  in  sunitinib  CL/F  with  95%  confidence  and  80%  power. 
Furthermore, assuming the coefficient of variation of sunitinib clearance among young adult patients is 
also ~35%, a total of 30 patients would allow detection of a 25% margin of error with 95% confidence 
and 80% power. 
Pediatric patients with GIST aged 6 to 18  years who met the selection criteria were to be enrolled in 
the study. A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients were enrolled in the study and were 
included  in  the  analysis  of  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  (see  table  below).  Of  the  6  enrolled  patients,  4 
patients  discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  objective  disease  progression  or  relapse,  1  patient 
discontinued treatment due to an AE, and 1 patient completed the treatment phase with 18 cycles and 
the  follow-up  phase.  Of  the  5  patients  who  discontinued  treatment,  4  patients  were  followed  up  for 
survival  and  completed  the  study  phase.  One  (1)  patient  discontinued  treatment  and  chose  to  not 
participate in the follow-up phase.

Full Analysis Population 
The  full  analysis  (or  intent-to-treat)  population  included  all  enrolled  patients  regardless  of  what 
treatment, if any,  was received. The efficacy analysis was based on the full analysis population. Note 
that if all patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment, this population would be equivalent to 
the as -treated population. 
As-Treated Population 
The as-treated population included all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 
safety analysis was based on the as-treated population. 
Pharmacokinetic Population 
The  PK  population  included  all  treated  patients  with  at  least  1  PK  observation.  The  PK  analysis  was 
based on PK population. 
Treatments 
Eligible patients were dosed based on the body surface area (BSA). The starting dose of sunitinib was 
15 mg/m2 per day administered orally per Schedule 4/2, (ie, 4 weeks on study treatment followed by 
2 weeks off treatment). 
Intra-patient  dose  escalation  of  sunitinib  was  allowed  after  completion  of  Cycle  1,  based  on  dose 
modification  guidelines.  Patients  were  monitored  for  toxicity,  and  the  sunitinib  dose  was  adjusted 
according to individual patient tolerance at the discretion of the Investigator. For patients <18 years, 
intra−patient  dose  escalation  of  sunitinib  was  allowed  after  completion  of  Cycle  1  and/or  later  cycles, 
and in the absence of toxicity greater than Grade 1 in the prior cycle.  
Dose escalation was in increments of 7.5 mg/m2 up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/m2 (not to exceed 
50 mg/day). 
The dose could be reduced in response to toxicities based on Investigator discretion. Dose reductions 
in patients <18 years was in decrements of 7.5 mg/m2. 
A treatment cycle was 42 days, and patients could receive up to 18 cycles of sunitinib therapy for up to 
24  months.  Patients  were  to  be  followed  for  overall  survival  (OS)  until  either  2  years  from  the  first 
dose of the study drug or completion of 18 cycles of study treatment.

Doses  higher  than  the  previously  defined  MTD  (15  mg/m2  per  day)  were  generally  well  tolerated  in 
this limited population (increase to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase 
to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Study Endpoints: 
• 
PK  parameters  of  sunitinib  and  its  main  active  metabolite  (SU012662)  including  total  plasma 
exposure (AUC24) and oral clearance (CL/F). 
Secondary Study Endpoints: 
• 
Type, incidence, severity (graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 [v4.0]), timing, seriousness, and relatedness 
of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities; 
•  Objective  response  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response  (DOR),  progression-free  survival  (PFS) 
and OS at 2 years after study enrollment; 
• 
PK-PD relationships with respect to safety and efficacy in paediatric GIST, if data allowed. 
Clinical Pharmacology-Methodology 
The primary objective of the study was characterization of PK profile. 
Pharmacokinetic  endpoints  were:  PK  parameters  of  sunitinib  and  its  main  active  metabolite, 
SU012662, including total plasma exposure (AUC from 0 to 24 hours [AUC24]) and CL/F. 
The post dose PK profile samples for sunitinib and its active metabolite (SU012662) were obtained at 
2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (see Table  below). Trough/pre-dose samples were 
collected  on  Days  1,  15,  and  28  of  Cycle  1  and  on  Days  1  and  28  of  Cycles  2−3.  Trough  PK  sample 
collection on Days 7 and 21 of Cycle 1 was optional. In addition, trough PK sample collection on Day 15 
of Cycles 2-3 was required only if the patient underwent dose escalation during that cycle. 
Pharmacokinetic  evaluation.  Standard  plasma  PK  parameters  including  trough  plasma  concentration 
(Ctrough),  Cmax,  time  to  first  occurrence  of  maximum  observed  plasma  concentration  (Tmax),  and 
area under the curve for concentration versus time profile from time 0 to 8 hours post dose (AUC8) for 
sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  estimated  following  non-compartmental  analysis  methods,  using  eNCA. 
Nominal  sample  collection  times  were  used  for  non-compartmental  analyses  of  sunitinib  and 
SU012662.  
Descriptive statistics for observed and dose-corrected (where appropriate) PK data was reported for all 
patients with at least one PK observation by presenting the population size, arithmetic mean, standard

deviation,  percent  coefficient  of  variation  (CV%),  median,  minimum,  maximum  values.  In  addition, 
geometric mean and the 95% CI for the geometric mean were reported where appropriate. 
In addition to the non-compartmental analyses, NONMEM approaches were to be used to estimate PK 
parameters  absorption  rate  constant  (Ka),  CL/F,  inter-compartmental  clearance  (Q/F),  volume  of 
distribution for the central compartment (Vc/F) and peripheral compartment (Vp/F). Other parameters 
such as  half-life for the distribution phase (t1/2α) and elimination phase (t1/2β), Cmax, and AUC24 
were to be estimated based on individual patient parameter estimates.  
Pharmacokinetic Analytical Methods. Human plasma samples were analyzed for sunitinib (also referred 
to  as  SU-011248  or  SUTENT)  and  its  active  metabolite  SU012662  (also  referred  to  as  SU-012662) 
concentrations  at  Bioanalytical  Systems,  Inc  (BASi,  Inc,  West  Lafayette,  Indiana)  using  a  validated 
analytical  assay  in  compliance  with  Pfizer  standard  operating  procedures.  Sunitinib  and  SU012662 
samples  were  assayed  using  a  validated,  sensitive,  and  specific  high  performance 
liquid 
chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC/MS/MS) method. 
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic.  In  addition  to  the  analyses  of  the  PK  data  listed  above,  PK-PD 
analyses were carried out with respect to selected safety and efficacy parameters. The PK-evaluable 
patients on Day 28 of Cycle 1 were divided into 2 PK subgroups: those with Total Drug Ctrough values 
less  than  the  median  Ctrough  value  (Lower  Exposure)  and  those  with  Total  Drug  Ctrough  values 
greater than or equal to the median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure).  
Subsequently,  the  summary  statistics  (n, %)  of  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  Nausea,  Vomiting, 
Diarrhea,  Fatigue,  Hand-foot  syndrome,  Neutropenia,  Thrombocytopenia,  Lymphopenia,  Anemia,  and 
Hypertension by maximum CTCAE Grade and for all Grades combined during Cycles 1 to 3 for both PK 
subgroups were generated. 
The  Pearson  correlation  coefficients  (R)  between  the  percent  change  in  the  laboratory  values  for 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC), thrombocyte count, lymphocyte count, systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hemoglobin (Hgb) with Total Drug Ctrough values were calculated 
with respect to PK visits Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3. The laboratory value nearest to the time of PK 
sample collection was used for correlation purposes. The overall assessment was based on an overall 
trend  observed  based  on  the  3  individual  correlation  values  and  is  included  in  the  Sponsor’s  Clinical 
Pharmacology Contribution (CPC) report. 
Furthermore,  the  summary  statistics  (n,  %,  or  median)  for  the  rate  of  SD,  ORR  (PR+CR),  and 
progressive  disease  based  on  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours  (RECIST),  as  well  as  for 
PFS  were provided in both PK subgroups, based on  Total Drug Ctrough  values on Day 28 of  Cycle 1. 
Finally,  the  R  values  between  the  PFS  with  Total  Drug  Ctrough  values  on  Day  28  of  Cycle  1  were 
calculated.  
Statistical Methods 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint (PK) 
Descriptive statistics for observed and dose-corrected (where appropriate) PK data will be reported for 
all  patients  with  at  least  one  PK  observation  by  presenting  the  population  size,  arithmetic  mean, 
standard  deviation,  percent  coefficient  of  variation  (CV%),  median,  minimum,  maximum  values.  In 
addition, geometric mean and the 95% CI for the geometric mean will be reported where appropriate. 
The  key  PK  parameters  in  paediatric  patients  will  be  compared  to  adult  patients  with  GIST  based  on 
historical  data.  The  formal  comparison  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  NONMEM  portion  using  the 
historical PK data in adult GIST patients.

Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints  
Efficacy  endpoints  were  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response  (DR),  progression-free 
survival (PFS), and OS.  
All  baseline  tumour  imaging  assessments  were  performed  within  28  days  prior  to  the  first  dose  of 
medication  and  then  within  14  days  prior  to  the  end  of  each  even-numbered  cycle  (ie,  Cycles  2,  4, 
etc.).  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  or  computed  tomography  (CT)  scans  with  contrast  agents 
(unless  contraindicated),  and  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  scans  were  used  for  tumor 
measurements. The determination of anti-tumor efficacy was based on Investigator’s objective tumor 
assessments.  Assessments  of  confirmed  complete  response  (CR)  or  partial  response  (PR)  were 
according  to  RECIST  version  1.1.  Designation  of  best  response  of  stable  disease  (SD)  required  the 
criteria to be met at least once after the first dose  of medication, at a minimum interval of 8  weeks. 
For  effusions  or  ascites,  only  cases  having  cytologic  proof  of  malignancy  were  recorded  as  tumour 
lesions on the case report form (CRF). Effusions that were not evaluated using cytology or were found 
to  be  non-malignant  were  not  recorded  on  the  ‘non-target  and  new  lesion’  CRF.  Measurable  lesions 
that were previously irradiated were not considered target lesions unless increase in size was observed 
following completion of radiation therapy. 
ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST version 
1.1. The number and percent of patients who achieved objective response (CR or PR) was summarized 
along  with  the  corresponding  exact  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  calculated  using  a  method 
based on the F distribution. 
DOR  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  first  objective  documentation  of  complete  or  partial  response 
(according  to  RECIST  version  1.1)  that  was  subsequently  confirmed  to  the  first  documentation  of 
disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR was calculated for the 
subgroup  of  patients  who  had  objective  disease  response  and  was  summarized  using  Kaplan-Meier 
methods and displayed graphically where appropriate. 
PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of the study drug to the date of the first 
documentation  of  objective  tumour  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  first. 
PFS  data  were  censored  on  the  day  following  the  date  of  the  last  tumour  assessment  documenting 
absence  of  progressive  disease  for  patients  who  1)  were  given  antitumour  treatment  other  than  the 
study  treatment  prior  to  observing  objective  tumour  progression;  2)  were  removed  from  the  study 
prior  to  documentation  of  objective  tumour  progression;  or  3)  were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the 
analysis.  Patients  who  did  not  have  any  post-baseline  tumour  assessments  had  their  PFS  endpoint 
censored  on  the  date  of  enrollment.  Death  or  disease  progression  that  occurred  after  more  than  1 
missed  visit  was  censored  on  the  day  following  the  date  of  the  last  tumour  assessment  as  well.  PFS 
was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods and displayed graphically where appropriate. Median PFS 
and its corresponding 2-sided 95% CI for the median were summarized. 
Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of death due to any 
cause.  For  patients  still  alive  at  the  time  of  analysis,  the  OS  time  was  censored  on  the  last  date  the 
patients were known to be alive. 
Analysis of safety parameters  
Frequencies  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  1  AE  were  displayed  by  System  Organ  Class(SOC)  and 
Preferred  Term  (PT)  according  to  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  terminology. 
Detailed  information  collected  for  each  AE  include  a  description  of  the  event,  duration,  severity, 
seriousness,  study  drug  relatedness,  action  taken,  and  clinical  outcome.  The  severity  of  the  AEs  was 
graded  according  to  the  NCI  CTCAE  version  4.0.  The  analyses  were  performed  on  AEs  classified  as

treatment-emergent.  Summary  tables  presented  the  number  of  patients  observed  with  AEs  and 
corresponding percentages. The denominator used to calculate incidence percentages consisted of the  
patients enrolled since all of them received at least 1 dose of study medication. Within each table, the 
AEs  were  categorized  by  MedDRA  system  organ  class  and  preferred  term.  Additional  subcategories 
were  based  on  event  intensity  and  relationship  to  study  drug.  Hematology  and  blood  chemistry  data 
were graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The frequencies of the worst severity grade observed 
were displayed for each parameter for the study and by cycle.

Pharmacokinetics results 
The summary of PK parameters is provided in the table reported below. At an oral dose of 15 mg/m2 
in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST,  the  median  Tmax  values  were  8.0  h  and  8.0  h  for  sunitinib  and 
SU012662,  respectively.  The  mean  Cmax  values  were  18.4  and  2.37  ng/mL  for  sunitinib  and 
SU012662,  respectively.  The  AUC8  was  82.7  and  10.7  ng.h/mL  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662, 
respectively. The respective inter-patient variability (CV%) in Cmax and AUC8 were 34% and 39% for 
sunitinib, and 17% and 35% for SU012662. The respective mean observed Ctrough values on Day 15 
of  Cycle  1,  and  on  Day  28  of  Cycles  1,  2,  3  were  24.4,  29.1,  44.7,  31.3  ng/mL  for  sunitinib;  11.7, 
13.0, 20.9, and 20.5 ng/mL for SU012662; and 36.0, 42.1, 65.6, and 51.8 ng/mL for Total Drug.  
Furthermore,  the  respective  mean  dose−corrected Ctrough  values  on  Day  15  of  Cycle  1,  and  on  Day 
28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 were 24.4, 29.1, 32.5, 19.9 ng/mL for sunitinib; 11.7, 13.0, 15.2, and 13.1 ng/mL 
for  SU012662;  and  36.0,  42.1,  47.7,  and  32.9  ng/mL  for  Total  Drug.  The  CV%  in  steady  state 
observed  or  dose-corrected  Ctrough  on  Day  28  of  Cycle  1  was  46%,  36%,  and  42%  for  sunitinib, 
SU012622, and Total Drug, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
The  PK-evaluable  patients  on  Day  28  of  Cycle  1  were  divided  into  2  PK  subgroups:  those  with  Total 
Drug Ctrough values less than the median Ctrough value (Lower Exposure) and those with Total Drug 
Ctrough values greater than or equal to the median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure). 
Relationship between Incidence of Selected Adverse Events And Plasma Drug Exposures 
The summary of incidence of AEs in Cycles 1-3 for PK subgroups below and above median trough Total 
Drug (sunitinib+SU012662) concentration on Day 28 of Cycle 1 is given in the following table:

Relationship between Efficacy Parameters and Plasma Drug Exposures 
The  relationship  between  efficacy  parameters  and  plasma  drug  exposures  for  PK  subgroups  Lower 
Exposure (<median total drug)  and Higher Exposure  (>= total median drug) is summarized below: 
The  rate  of  RECIST-defined  SD  and  objective  response  (CR  or  PR)  were  33.3%  and  0%  in  the  PK 
subgroup  with  less  than  median  Ctrough  value  (Lower  Exposure)  and  66.7%  and  0%  in  the  PK 
subgroup with greater than or equal to median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure) on Day 28 of Cycle 1, 
respectively.

The median PFS was 2.6 months for the PK subgroup with Lower Exposure and 9.0 months in the PK 
subgroup with Higher Exposure on Day 28 of Cycle 1 (Study A6181196 CSR Table 14.4.3.9.5). The R 
value for the relationship between PFS and trough Total Drug plasma concentration on Day 28 of Cycle 
1 was 0.59, indicating a moderate positive correlation (0.5≤R< 0.7) 
Efficacy results 
Best  overall  response,  PFS,  and  OS  were  measured  as  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  the  intent-to-
treat population and are summarized in the table below. Since none of the study patients experienced 
CR  or  PR,  an  analysis  of  DOR  was  not  performed.  The  best  overall  response  was  SD  (reported  in  3 
patients  [50.0%])  and  objective  progression  (observed  in  3  patients  [50.0%]).  PFS  events  were 
reported  in  4  (66.7%)  patients.  Two  (2)  patients  (33.3%)  were  censored  from  the  PFS  analysis 
because they did not have disease progression. The median PFS was estimated to be 5.8 months (95% 
CI: 2.3, not reached [NR]) 
There  were  no  deaths  in  the  study  population.  Consequently,  all  patients  were  censored  and  OS  was 
not  summarized  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  The  time  from  the  first  study  dose  to  the  last 
available survival follow-up ranged from 0.9 years to 2.4 years for the 6 patients.

Safety results 
Extent of Exposure to Sunitinib 
Extent  of  exposure  to  the  study  treatment  was  assessed  in  terms  of  number  of  treatment  days, 
treatment  cycles,  and  dose  levels.  Treatment  duration  ranged  from  110  to  742  days  with  a  median 
duration of 219 days  (Table 3). Of the 6 patients in the as-treated population, all received at least 3 
cycles of the study treatment and 1 patient received all 18 of the planned cycles. The mean cumulative 
dose was 4866.67 mg, with a mean relative intensity of 97.62%, and the mean daily dose was 27.12 
mg or 19.07 mg/m2. 
Summary of Adverse Events (All Causalities) 
A total of 82 AEs were reported as TEAEs in the as-treated population. In all 6 patients, at least 1 TEAE 
was  reported.  AEs  of  Grade  3  or  4  severity  were  reported  in  5  (83.3%)  patients.  There  were  no 
patients with SAEs or Grade 5 AEs. 
One  (1)  patient  had  a  dose  reduction  due  to  an  AE,  4  patients  temporarily  discontinued  study 
treatment, and 1 patient permanently discontinued study treatment due to an AE.

Summary of Adverse Events (All Causalities) – As-Treated Population 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities) 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  of  any  grade  was  100%  (6  patients)  (Table  5).  The  majority  of  the 
reported AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Three (3) patients had 1 Grade 3 AE each, and 2 patients 
had 1 Grade 4 AE each. There were no reports of Grade 5 TEAEs. 
Overall, Headache (Grades 1 or 2) was reported in 4 (66.7%) patients and Diarrhoea (Grades 1 or 2), 
Nausea (Grade 1), Neutropenia (Grades 2 to 4), or white blood cell (WBC) count decreased (Grade 2) 
were reported in 3 patients each, respectively. 
Hepatic hematoma and Intra-abdominal hemorrhage TEAEs (Grade 4) were reported in 1 patient. Both 
of  these  events  were  determined  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  disease  progression.  This 
conclusion  was  supported  by  laparotomy  showing  multiple  lesions  localized  at  stomach  wall,  liver, 
lymph node at falx hepatis, and massive peritoneal dissemination, with hemorrhagic ascites. 
The  other  Grade  4  TEAE  was  Neutropenia  that  was  reported  in  1  patient  and  led  to  dose  reduction. 
Grade  3  TEAEs 
reported  were  Hypoglycaemia,  Hypophosphataemia,  Neutropenia,  and 
Thrombocytopenia. 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
A total of 59 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in the study.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Delay, Dose Reduction, or Permanent Discontinuation 
One (1) patient (16.7%) was permanently discontinued from the study treatment due to a treatment-
related  AE  of  Anaemia  (Grade  2)  that  was  eventually  resolved.  One  (1)  patient  (16.7%)  had  a  dose 
reduction due to Grade 4 Neutropenia TEAE. 
Four  (4)  patients  (66.7%)  had  temporary  discontinuations  due  to  treatment-related  TEAEs  that  were 
Neutropenia,  Hypoglycaemia,  and  Thrombocytopenia  (all  Grade  3),  and  Neutropenia  (Grade  2),  in  1 
patient (16.7%) each respectively. 
All events that led to treatment delay, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation had resolved. 
Deaths and Other Serious Adverse Events 
There were no deaths or SAEs reported in Study A6181196. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Most of the results for laboratory chemistry were within normal range (shown as Grade 0) or severity 
Grade 1. Hypoglycaemia and hypophosphataemia findings (Grade 3) were reported in 1 patient each, 
respectively.  Creatinine,  hyperglycaemia,  and  hypoglycaemia  findings  (Grade  2)  were  reported  in  1 
patient each, respectively.  
Grade 3 hypoglycemia and hypophosphataemia were also reported as TEAEs. 
With regard to the laboratory hematology tests,the only Grade 4 abnormality reported was neutrophils 
(absolute)  decreased  in  1(16.7%)  patient.  The  other  abnormalities  included  Grades  3  neutropenia, 
platelets decreased and anaemia in 1 (16.7%) patient each. Grade 2 abnormalities were a decrease in 
WBC in all 6 (100%) patients, decrease in neutrophils (absolute) in 4 (66.7%) patients, and anaemia 
in 1 (16.7%) patient. Grade 1 abnormalities were lymphopenia in all 6 (100.0%) patients, decrease in 
platelets  in  3  (50.0%)  patients,  anaemia  in  2  (33.3%)  patients,  and  hemoglobin  increased  in  1 
(16.7%) patient.  
Grade 4 decrease in neutrophils (absolute) and Grade 3 anaemia, decrease in neutrophils (absolute), 
and decrease in platelets were also reported as TEAE. 
Vital Signs and Other Measurements 
Vital  signs  of  body  weight,  body  temperature,  blood  pressure  (BP),  heart  rate,  and  respiratory  rate 
were measured at screening and at every study visit. 
None  of  the  patients  had  abnormal  pulse  rate  (>120  bpm  or  <50  bpm)  or  a  high  body  temperature 
(>38.3°C) at any visit. No patients had abnormal BP (SBP >150 mmHg/DBP >100 mmHg or SBP >200 
mmHg/DBP >110 mmHg). A change from baseline in SBP of ≥20 mm Hg was reported in 1 (16.7%) 
patient. A change from baseline in DBP of ≥10 mm Hg was reported in 5 (83.3%) patients and of ≥20 
mm Hg in 3 (50.0%) patients. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  who  had  shifts  in  QTcF  interval  from  within  normal  range 
(Grade  0)  at  baseline  to  Grade  ≥3  post-baseline  (Grade  3:  QTc  ≥501  ms  on  at  least  2  separate 
electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  Grade  4:  QTc  ≥501  or  >60  ms  change  from  baseline  and  Torsade  de 
pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  MAH  submitted  a  Phase  (I/II  Study  A6181196)  of  Sunitinib  In  Young  Patients  With  Advanced 
Gastrointestinal  Stromal  Tumour.  Study  A6181196  was  a  single-arm,  multi-center,  multi-national, 
Phase  I/II  clinical  trial  evaluating  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  preliminary  anti-tumour 
efficacy  of  sunitinib 
in  children  and  young  adults  diagnosed  with  advanced  unresectable 
gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). 
The primary objective of the study was characterization of PK profile. 
A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients (age: 14.3 years (1.4 SD) were enrolled in the 
study and were included in the analysis of PK, safety, and efficacy. 
Eligible patients were dosed based on the body surface area (BSA).  The starting dose of sunitinib was 
15 mg/m2 per day administered orally per Schedule 4/2, (ie, 4 weeks on study treatment followed by 
2 weeks off treatment). Intra-patient dose escalation of sunitinib was allowed after completion of Cycle 
1,  based  on  dose  modification  guidelines.  Dose  escalation  was  in  increments  of  7.5  mg/m2  up  to  a 
maximum  dose  of  30  mg/m2  (not  to  exceed  50  mg/day).  The  dose  could  be  reduced  in  response  to 
toxicities based on Investigator discretion.   
A treatment cycle was 42 days, and patients could receive up to 18 cycles of sunitinib therapy for up to 
24  months.  Patients  were  to  be  followed  for  overall  survival  (OS)  until  either  2  years  from  the  first 
dose of the study drug or completion of 18 cycles of study treatment. 
Doses  higher  than  the  previously  defined  MTD  (15  mg/m2  per  day)  were  generally  well  tolerated  in 
this limited population (increase to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase 
to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients). 
At an oral dose of 15 mg/m2 in pediatric patients with GIST, the median Tmax values were 8.0 h and 
8.0 h for sunitinib and SU012662, respectively. The mean Cmax values were 18.4 and 2.37 ng/mL for 
sunitinib  and  SU012662,  respectively.  The  AUC8  was  82.7  and  10.7  ng.h/mL  for  sunitinib  and 
SU012662,  respectively.  The  respective  inter-patient  variability  (CV%)  in  C max  and  AUC8  were  34% 
and 39% for sunitinib, and 17% and 35% for SU012662. The respective mean observed Ctrough values 
on Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 were 24.4, 29.1, 44.7, 31.3 ng/mL for sunitinib; 
11.7, 13.0, 20.9, and 20.5 ng/mL for SU012662; and 36.0, 42.1, 65.6, and 51.8 ng/mL for Total Drug. 
Furthermore,  the  respective  mean  dose−corrected  Ctrough  values  (the  dose-corrected  trough 
concentrations  were  calculated  by  multiplying  the  observed  concentration  by  the  correction  factor: 
starting  dose/actual  dose)  on  Day  15  of  Cycle  1,  and  on  Day  28  of  Cycles  1,  2,  3  were  24.4,  29.1, 
32.5, 19.9 ng/mL for sunitinib; 11.7, 13.0, 15.2, and 13.1 ng/mL for SU012662; and 36.0, 42.1, 47.7, 
and 32.9 ng/mL for Total Drug. The CV% in steady state observed or dose-corrected Ctrough on Day 28 
of Cycle 1 was 46%, 36%, and 42% for sunitinib, SU012622, and Total Drug, respectively.

The  PK-evaluable  patients  on  Day  28  of  Cycle  1  were  divided  into  2  PK  subgroups:  those  with  Total 
Drug  Ctrough  values  less  than  the  median  Ctrough  value  (Lower  Exposure)  and  those  with  Total  Drug 
Ctrough values greater than or equal to the median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure). 
Regarding the relationship between safety and plasma drug exposures, it was observed that  a higher 
incidence  of  all  grade  AEs  (gastrointestinal-related  and  fatigue)  and  a  higher  degree  of  decrease  in 
some  of  the  haematology  findings  (a  greater  percent  decrease  from  baseline  in  absolute  neutrophil 
count and platelet count was observed) with higher Total Drug plasma concentrations. 
Furthermore, regarding the relationship between efficacy and plasma drug exposures a higher rate of 
SD  and  a  longer  PFS  time  in  patients  with  higher  total  drug  plasma  concentrations  have  been 
observed, indicating sunitinib's anti-tumour activity at higher plasma drug concentrations in paediatric 
patients with GIST. 
No  confirmed  objective  responses  were  reported  in  the  6  patients  enrolled  and  treated,  with  SD 
reported in 50% of the evaluable population as best overall response.  
A total of 82 TEAEs (59 considered treatment-related by the investigator), mostly Grade 1-2 in severity 
were reported in the as-treated population. No SAEs or Grade 5 TEAEs were reported. Only one patient 
permanently  discontinued  treatment  due  a  treatment-related  AE  (anaemia  Grade  2).  No  new  safety 
signals  were  identified,  and  the  safety  profile  appeared  to  be  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  in 
adults. 
In  conclusion,  the  number  of  patients  enrolled  in  study  A6181196  do  not  allow  to  draw  any  sound 
conclusion  about  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in  children  and  young  adults 
diagnosed with advanced unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).

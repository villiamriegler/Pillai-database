2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for Inaqovi (ASTX727) is for the ‘treatment of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed AML who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy.’ 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a clonal disorder caused by malignant transformation of a bone 
marrow derived, myeloid stem cell or progenitor cell, that fail to undergo normal differentiation. AML is 
differentiated from other haematopoietic malignancies by the presence of greater than 20% 
myeloblasts in the bone marrow. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
AML is the most common form of acute leukaemia in adults, with incidence increasing with age and the 
shortest survival (5-year survival 24%) (Shallis et al 2019). The median age at diagnosis is 67 years 
(Fey and Buske 2013). The median age at diagnosis of AML is 67 years (Fey and Buske 2013). Based 
on the data from Globocan 2020 (Sung et al 2021), European Cancer Information System (ECIS) 2022 
(ECIS 2022), and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) in the United States (NCI SEER), supportive literature, and other community data, the 
estimated prevalence of AML in the European Union is below 5 per 10,000. In general, AML in elderly 
patients is more likely to be preceded by myelodysplastic syndrome, to have unfavourable 
cytogenetics, and to be refractory to chemotherapy (Appelbaum et al 2006).  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
The clinical presentation of AML is directly related to ineffective haematopoiesis; patients typically 
present with signs and symptoms of fatigue, haemorrhage, as well as infections and fever (Löwenberg 
1999). The effects of uncontrolled, exaggerated growth and accumulation of blasts that fail to function 
as normal blood cells, and the resultant reduction of normal marrow cells, are anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Untreated, AML is a rapidly progressing and fatal disease that 
requires prompt attention (Gilliland 2008). Only 20% of AML patients >70 years are alive 1 year after 
the diagnosis (Naur et al 2021). 
In addition to age, other adverse prognostic indicators in AML include adverse cytogenetic or molecular 
genetic abnormalities, past exposure to chemicals, radiation, or chemotherapy, or history of another 
haematological disorder (Schiffer 2021). There are correlations between age at diagnosis of AML, 
medical comorbidities, and underlying cytogenetic and molecular aberrations (DiNardo and Cortes 
2016);  furthermore, cytogenetics and genetic mutations are the most accurate predictors of treatment 
resistance (Estey 2018). 
2.1.4.  Management 
Curative therapies, including intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, are 
generally applicable to the minority of patients who are younger. Patients not suitable for induction 
therapy (generally >65 years old and/or with significant co-morbidities) are often treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 11/130 
 
 
 
hypomethylating agents (HMAs) administered parenterally which imposes a significant treatment 
burden. The HMAs decitabine (Dacogen®) and azacitidine (Vidaza®) are approved by the EMA for 
adult patients with AML who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy. Administration of 
these products requires hospital visits for the patient. 
2.2.  About the product 
Inaqovi (ASTX727) is a fixed-dose combination tablet for oral administration, containing 35 mg 
decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine. It is intended to provide decitabine exposures equivalent to 
intravenous (IV) decitabine at the European Union (EU)-approved dose. 
Cedazuridine (E7727), is a novel cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor. It is a new chemical entity. 
Administration of cedazuridine with oral decitabine reduces first pass metabolism of decitabine upon 
absorption, thus enhancing the oral bioavailability of decitabine so that oral administration is feasible. 
Decitabine is a known substance, previously approved for intravenous administration at a dose of 20 
mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 consecutive days (i.e., a total of 5 
doses per treatment cycle).  
The proposed indication for Inaqovi is:  
Inaqovi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy.  
This is essentially the same indication as that approved for Dacogen (“Dacogen is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML), according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, who are not candidates for 
standard induction chemotherapy”).  
The proposed dosage for Inaqovi is:  
The recommended dose of Inaqovi is 1 tablet once daily on Days 1 through 5 of each 28-day cycle.  
Repeat cycles every 28 days. Treatment with Inaqovi should continue for a minimum of 4 cycles until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Blood cell counts should be obtained prior to initiating Inaqovi and before each cycle. Dose 
adjustments can be made by reducing the number of treatment days in a cycle or by delaying the next 
cycle, based on toxicity (haematological and non-haematological).  
Inaqovi is intended for self-administration at home.  
The application involves a new route of administration for decitabine. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
This application is based on a PK bridge, assuming that previous efficacy and safety data for IV 
decitabine can be extrapolated to Inaqovi if the decitabine plasma exposure (total AUC over the 5-day 
treatment cycle) is similar. 
This is in accordance with the CHMP Scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/485806/2018), provided on 
26 July 2018, where the CHMP considered that the ongoing pivotal phase 3 randomised, crossover 
study design (ASTX727-02) with AUC equivalence to decitabine IV as the primary endpoint, and clinical 
efficacy/safety and biological activity as secondary endpoints, should provide sufficient information to 
support bridging to the clinical data that supported the approval of Dacogen® (decitabine). If the data 
demonstrates similarity between ASTX727 and IV decitabine, in terms of the clinically relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 12/130 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety, then this would support inclusion of the indication as current 
registered by Dacogen in the EU. The CHMP advice included recommendations to include AML subjects 
in the Phase 3 study as well as adding justification for absence of specific nonclinical studies. Study 
ASTX727-02 was amended to incorporate CHMP’s recommendation, including the addition of AML 
subjects.

solvents.  
Cedazuridine is a chiral molecule with four stereocentres. Cedazuridine has one anomeric stereocentre, 
which is potentially prone to epimerisation and has β stereochemistry; the required configuration is 
ensured during the synthesis via a resolution step. All other stereocentres cannot be epimerise. The 
chirality in regulatory starting material T6 is introduced via naturally occurring D-mannitol. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC (related substances) and specific optical 
rotation.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for cedazuridine. Only one form was identified, and this was 
designated as Form A.

2.4.3.  Active substance: Decitabine 
General information 
The chemical name of decitabine is 4-amino-1-[(2R,4S,5R)-4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-
1,3,5-triazin- 2(1H)-one corresponding to the molecular formula C8H12N4O4. It has a molecular mass of 
228.21 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 2: Decitabine structure 
The chemical structure of decitabine was elucidated by a combination of IR, GC, MS, elemental 
analysis, 13C-NMR and 1H-NMR. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by 
XPRD. 
Decitabine is a white to off-white solid, hygroscopic and slightly soluble in water.  
Decitabine is a chiral compound with three stereogenic centres (2R, 4S, 5R). The configuration of 
decitabine active substance is given by the starting material used in its synthetic process, which is the 
natural monosaccharide 2-deoxy-D-ribose. The use of this starting material fixes the S, R configuration 
of the carbons C4 and C5, respectively. From the starting material, all the intermediates of the 
synthesis are obtained as a mixture of α and β anomers (C2), until the last manufacturing step where 
the β-anomer corresponding to decitabine active substance is isolated by crystallisation.

2.4.4.  Finished medicinal product - Inaqovi 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product, Inaqovi, is an oral fixed-dose combination film-coated tablet containing 35 mg 
decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine as active substances. The film-coated tablets are red, oval 
biconvex in shape, 15 mm x 8 mm, plain on one side and debossed with ‘H35’ on the other side.  
No overages are proposed. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards, with the exception of iron oxide red which complies with the NF, this 
is acceptable. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. 
The purpose of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an oral dosage form as an alternative 
to the approved intravenous (IV) Dacogen, containing decitabine. Cedazuridine is a novel cytidine 
deaminase inhibitor. Administration of cedazuridine with oral decitabine reduces first pass metabolism 
of decitabine upon absorption, thus enhancing the oral bioavailability of decitabine so that oral 
administration is feasible.  
Based on the results of a phase 1 clinical study, conducted using capsules containing different 
concomitant oral doses of cedazuridine and decitabine, a dosage of 100 mg cedazuridine and 35 mg 
decitabine was identified to provide decitabine exposure comparable to those of the therapeutic dose, 
20 mg/m2, of IV decitabine (Dacogen).  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as summarised in below.

An excipient compatibility study was conducted to select appropriate excipients for the finished product 
formulation. The formulation development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and 
design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process 
parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 17/130 
 
 
 
The critical quality attributes identified were: aappearance (allow ease of visual product identification), 
identification (ascertain active identity), assay (confirm potency), related substances (ascertain 
product safety), dissolution (ascertain consistent absorption), uniformity of dosage units (ascertain 
consistent dosages), water content (ascertain product stability) and microbiological limits (ascertain 
microbial safety of the finished product). 
Based on a risk analysis, the formulation ingredients which may have significant effects on the CQAs 
were identified. These ingredients were evaluated in a design of experiments study to confirm the 
robustness of the levels of these ingredients in the formulation.  
Both cedazuridine and decitabine have high solubility, according to Biopharmaceutics Classification 
System (BCS). The particle size of these active substances is not expected to have significant impact 
on the dissolution performance. This has been confirmed by the dissolution of finished product batches 
manufactured up to date. It was concluded that particle size distribution is not a critical material 
attribute and micronisation of cedazuridine is not required from dissolution perspective. 
Cedazuridine is a crystalline anhydrous free base and is not hygroscopic. It has only one crystalline 
form based on the results of a polymorph screening study (see active substance section). Form A was 
shown to be stable under mechanical stress. No significant change in the XRPD pattern was observed 
after compaction. Decitabine has two polymorphs. Form A, an anhydrate, and form B, a monohydrate. 
Decitabine Form A has been used in the development of the finished product; it is stable during 
storage and it was also shown to be stable under mechanical stress. No significant change was 
observed in the XRPD pattern after compaction. Decitabine is hygroscopic and should be protected 
from moisture. 
The finished product has been formulated as an immediate release tablet, as the compounds have 
suitable physical, biopharmaceutical, chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics. A direct 
compression manufacturing process was successfully developed for the manufacture of the finished 
product, consisting of sieving, blending, compression, and coating steps. Based on the results of the 
process development studies, proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been accepted. During the 
procedure it has been confirmed that no more than one PAR is varied at a time in each unit operation, in 
line with guidance. The proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully also support the proposed PARs. 
The formulation and manufacturing process for the tablet used in the pivotal clinical study ASTX727-02 
are identical to those proposed for the to-be-marketed tablet.  
The primary packaging of the finished product is PVC/Aluminum blisters with laminated desiccant 
(3-ply cold formable aluminum-plastic). The material complies with EU Commission Regulation No. 
10/2011, as amended. The suitability of the container closure system in terms of protection from light 
and moisture, safety of its materials, and compatibility between the materials and the finished product 
has been demonstrated. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product, by direct compression, consists of 7 main steps: 1. 
pre-blending, 2. de-agglomeration, 3. main blending, 4. lubricant blending, 5. compression, 6 coating 
and 7. packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Satisfactory data on 3 consecutive validation batches has been provided. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a

reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
During the procedure, stability data from 2 commercial scale batches has been provided, supporting 
the proposed bulk holding time of 12 months with no specific storage conditions. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual), cedazuridine and decitabine identification (HPLC and MS), cedazuridine and 
decitabine assay (HPLC), cedazuridine and decitabine degradation products (HPLC),  cedazuridine and 
decitabine dissolution (Ph. Eur.), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), water (Ph. Eur.) and microbial 
examination (Ph. Eur.). 
During the procedure the shelf-life limits for the assay of both active substances have been tightened. 
The proposed specifications are in line with guidance requirements and acceptable.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 6 commercial scale (process validation or clinical/stability) and 
6 pilot scale (clinical and/or stability) batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process 
and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on five different batches using a validated ICP-MS method were provided, and updated during the 
procedure, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the 
respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it 
is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed, and updated during the procedure, as requested by the CHMP, considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020 Rev. 16) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Since the finished product falls under 
the scope of ICH S9, the point was raised as an “other concern”. Based on the information provided, it 
is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substances or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  primary  stability  batches  (half  of  the  commercial  scale)  of  finished  product 
stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under 
intermediate conditions (30ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC 
/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical 
to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing

(PVC/alu blister). Cedazuridine batches from both of its manufacturers were used to manufacture the 
stability batches. 
Samples were tested in line with the shelf-life specification. All the results were within the specification 
limits.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant differences were observed in the tested parameters 
(appearance,  assay,  degradation,  dissolution  and  water  content).  The  finished  product  is  considered 
photostable.  
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  on  samples  of  the  finished  product  by  exposing  them  to 
thermal (70°C open dish) and thermal and humidity (60°C/35%RH open dish). An increase of decitabine 
degradation products was observed under the thermal with humidity (60°C/35% RH) stress condition. 
Little  or  no  degradation  was  observed  under  the  other  conditions.  Cedazuridine  is  stable  and  did  not 
show  increased  trend  of  any  impurity  under  the  test  conditions.  The  analytical  procedures  used  were 
stability  indicating.  Due  to  the  potential  for  moisture  sensitivity  of  decitabine  observed  in  the  forced 
degradation study, it is recommended to maintain the tablets in the original container closure system. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months, with the following storage 
conditions Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture. This medicinal product does 
not require any special temperature storage conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. No major objections were raised during the procedure. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action  
Decitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after 
phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing 
hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation and/or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced 
hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the 
control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of 
decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase 
and decitabine incorporated into DNA.  
Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is an enzyme that is responsible for the degradation of cytidine nucleosides, 
including the cytidine analog decitabine. High levels of CDA in the gastrointestinal tract and liver 
rapidly degrade these nucleosides and prohibit or limit their oral bioavailability. Cedazuridine inhibits 
CDA. Oral administration of cedazuridine with decitabine increases the systemic exposure of decitabine 
via inhibition of first pass metabolism of decitabine in the gut and liver by CDA. 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
The in vitro nonclinical primary pharmacodynamics (PD) studies have been focused on characterisation 
of the pharmacological profile of cedazuridine, the new chemical entity (NCE) in ASTX727. The other 
component, decitabine, is clinically well known as an intravenously administrated hypomethylating 
agent. 
The inhibitory effect of cedazuridine on CDA was confirmed in vitro. Cedazuridine potency assays 
showed a Ki of 400 nM in a preliminary study, and EC50 of 281 ± 58 nM in a definitive study. 
Furthermore, the addition of cedazuridine to an incubation of gemcitabine and CDA (gemcitabine is a 
deoxycytidine, partly similar to decitabine, and both are CDA substrates), resulted in an increase in the 
half-life (t1/2) of gemcitabine from <36 minutes to >66 hours.  
Measurement of anti-proliferative activity of cedazuridine in human cancer cell lines demonstrated that 
cedazuridine, as a single agent, do not have an anti-proliferative effect. Thus, the results are in 
agreement with cedazuridine being able to foster oral use of decitabine with its anti-proliferative effect 
and not being intended for administration as a single agent.  
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
Administration of oral cedazuridine was demonstrated to enhance anti-tumour activity to oral 
decitabine, in similarity to anti-tumour activity of IV decitabine, without providing any anti-tumour 
activity in itself both in a syngeneic and a xenotransplant mouse leukaemia model. It is noted that in 
the groups receiving the highest dose of cedazuridine in combination with oral decitabine, the survival 
time was significantly longer as compared to the IV decitabine group. However, since no exposure 
values were provided, it is not possible to draw any conclusions from such a comparison of survival 
time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 21/130 
 
 
 
Demethylating activity on long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) sequences was 
demonstrated in monkeys orally co-administered decitabine and cedazuridine. The decitabine dose 
level was kept the same in all groups while for the three groups administered cedazuridine the dose 
level of cedazuridine was increased stepwise between the groups. However, no control with only oral 
decitabine was included and no dose response to the various doses of cedazuridine could be observed, 
making it difficult to conclude on the contribution by the cedazuridine part in this particular study.   
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The in vitro secondary pharmacology screen on cedazuridine do not indicate any cause for concern 
regarding off-target binding. Any off-target concerns for ASTX727 are anticipated to be the result of 
potential effects of decitabine which has been in clinical use for many years. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology studies on cedazuridine do not indicate any cause for concern. Regarding 
effects on the CV system, the conclusion is based on in vitro hERG and actional potential assay data 
and on in vivo evaluations on standard ECG parameters in monkeys (the latter with margins to the 
recommended clinical dose for AUC of >10-20-fold and for Cmax >10-30-fold). Furthermore, no 
cedazuridine-related effects were observed in the respiratory system (based on evaluations in 
conscious monkeys, with margins to the recommended clinical dose for AUC >20-fold and for Cmax 
>10-fold)) or in the CNS (based on observational battery study in mice after up to highest dose 
tested at 2000 mg/kg).  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical PK evaluations have been conducted to characterise the absorption profiles of cedazuridine, 
cedazuridine epimer (the main metabolite), decitabine and the combination of cedazuridine and 
decitabine (i.e., ASTX27). Nonclinical distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiling have been 
focused on cedazuridine, the NCE part of ASTX27. The single- and repeat-dose PK profiles were 
examined in mice, rats, and monkeys. Single-dose studies included comparative bioavailability and PK 
assessment studies with cedazuridine to evaluate potential differences in exposure in multiple species 
(mice, rats, and monkeys) and with decitabine to evaluate differences in exposure using multiple 
routes of administration (i.e., oral, IV, or intra-duodenal). The dose-response effects of cedazuridine in 
inhibiting CDA and increasing systemic decitabine exposure following oral administration, the key 
feature for the FDC approach, was evaluated in studies in mice and monkeys in which cedazuridine and 
decitabine were administered concomitantly or at staggered time points.  
Distribution, metabolism, and excretion of cedazuridine have been examined in a quantitative whole-
body autoradiography (QWBA) and mass balance study in mice following oral dosing and a mass 
balance study in monkeys following oral or IV dosing. In addition, distribution and metabolism of 
cedazuridine have been evaluated in in vitro studies including plasma protein binding and blood 
partitioning studies, metabolic stability studies in simulated gastric fluid and in hepatocytes, liver 
cytosol, and liver S9 fractions. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition and induction assays, and human 
transporter studies are covered in the clinical pharmacokinetic assessment report.

Methods of analysis 
Cedazuridine, cedazuridine epimer (the main metabolite), decitabine and cytidine were quantified by 
LC-MS/MS in samples of mouse, rat and monkey plasma. Parent compound and metabolite 
concentrations in plasma, urine, faeces, cage rinse and cage debris were obtained by HPLC. Metabolite 
structural elucidation was performed by the use of LC MS/MS. The bioanalytical methods are 
considered adequate.   
Absorption 
A comparative PK study of cedazuridine alone was conducted in mouse, rat and monkey. The results 
indicate that the oral absorption is fast to moderate in mouse, and moderate in rat and monkey. 
Furthermore, the PK of cedazuridine in all three species was characterised by a moderate volume of 
distribution, slow clearance, and moderate t1/2 following IV administration. The oral bioavailability of 
cedazuridine ranged from 8.9% to 22.9% in mice and indicates possible saturation of absorption and a 
less than dose-proportional PK. In rats and fasted monkeys, the oral bioavailability of cedazuridine 
ranged from 10.6% to 15.3% and exposures to cedazuridine were generally dose-proportional over the 
dose ranges tested. In monkeys, food decreased the absorption of cedazuridine by approximately 50% 
and the Cmax and AUCinf values in fed animals were approximately 25% and 50%, respectively, of 
those observed in fasted animals.  
In the comparative PK study, an evaluation the cedazuridine epimer was also included. The exposure 
(AUCinf) to the epimer following oral administration of cedazuridine was noted to be approximately 
30% of the exposure of the parent compound in mice while in rats and monkeys, the exposure to the 
epimer ranged from 51.5% to 62.7% and 28.3% to 38.7% of the parent compound exposure, 
respectively. The corresponding exposure to the epimer in human plasma following administration of 
RHD was 43.1 to 46.9% of total radioactivity. In the animal species, a larger formation of the epimer 
was observed following oral administration than IV administration. 
The single-dose PK of decitabine administered alone was evaluated in a single non-GLP study 
examining the comparative PK of decitabine via multiple routes of administration (IV, oral, and intra-
duodenal (ID)) in male rhesus monkeys. When decitabine was administered alone without 
coadministration with cedazuridine, the plasma concentration declined rapidly with mean terminal t1/2 
of 0.17, 0.44 and 0.16 hours, following IV, PO or ID administration, respectively. The results from this 
study suggest that absorption and bioavailability of decitabine appear to be greater in the stomach 
than in the duodenum and the small intestine, resulting in higher exposures after oral dosing than 
after intra-duodenal dosing. 
For the PK evaluation of the combination of cedazuridine and decitabine (ASTX727), the dose-response 
effect of cedazuridine pre-treatment on decitabine systemic exposure was investigated in mice and 
monkeys.  
In the mouse study, following administration of 1 mg/kg of decitabine alone by IV or oral 
administration, the decitabine plasma concentration declined rapidly with short terminal phase t1/2 
values (0.57 and 0.45 hours, respectively). Pretreatment with oral cedazuridine (at 0.1, 1 or 10 
mg/kg) 30 min before oral decitabine (0.1 mg/kg) resulted in a decitabine dose-related increase in 
Cmax (47.4, 63.4 and 71.6 ng/mL) and AUC0-t (45.2, 56.1 and 126 ng*h/mL) as compared to 
treatment with oral decitabine (0.1 mg/kg) only (Cmax: 23.8 ng/mL, AUC0-t: 22.7 ng*h/mL). As 
expected, IV administered cedazuridine (1 mg/kg) led to higher cedazuridine exposure than oral 
cedazuridine (1 mg/kg) but was shown to have a similar level of boosting effect on decitabine plasma 
exposure as following the orally administered cedazuridine.

In the monkey study, increasing pre-treatment doses of cedazuridine (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg) combined 
with a single oral fixed dose of 10 mg/kg decitabine, administered 2 hours after cedazuridine, resulted 
in increased systemic exposures to decitabine (AUC 0-t: 138, 1030 and 1130 ng*h/ml; Cmax: 110, 
647 and 725 ng/ml, respectively). However, the maximum increase in decitabine exposure was 
achieved with cedazuridine pre-treatment at 1 mg/kg, and no further increase occurred at 10 mg/kg 
cedazuridine, although a dose-related 4- to 5-fold increase in cedazuridine AUC and Cmax occurred. 
Thus, increasing the dose of cedazuridine from 1 to 10 mg/kg resulted in a less than dose proportional 
increase in oral decitabine exposure. No control with only oral decitabine was included. The decitabine 
half-life for the cedazuridine 1 and 10 mg/kg treated groups was 1.45 and 1.05 hours, respectively. 
For the cedazuridine 0.1 mg/kg treated group the decitabine half-life were not determined due to 
insufficient data. 
Pre-administration of the cedazuridine epimer (1 mg/kg) to mice prior to oral administration of 
decitabine (0.1 mg/kg) resulted in plasma exposures of decitabine that was approximately 25% of 
those observed following cedazuridine pre-treatment. As also observed in monkey, the epimer plasma 
concentrations were higher following an oral dose of cedazuridine (1 mg/kg) in comparison to an 
equivalent IV dose of cedazuridine, possibly due to higher inter-conversion of the epimer in the GI 
tract prior to or during absorption.  
To evaluate a more clinically relevant dose of decitabine, an additional study in monkeys was 
conducted. In this study, increasing doses of oral cedazuridine followed 1 hour later by a fixed oral 
dose of decitabine (3 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in decitabine exposure (table 1). 
However, the decitabine t1/2 did not show any clear dose-dependent pattern.

Circulating cedazuridine epimer exposures, although varied across individual animals and groups, 
appeared on average to be at near-equivalent levels compared to cedazuridine. Based on formulation 
analysis and observed epimer exposures, it can be concluded that it is apparent that most of the 
cedazuridine conversion to its epimer takes place following dosing by the oral route and this is 
accepted. 
The plasma cytidine levels appeared to increase transiently after treatment with cedazuridine in a 
dose-dependent manner and it is consistent with cedazuridine acting as an inhibitor of CDA. The 
plasma cytidine levels reverted to or trended towards baseline by 8 hours post-dose. it is suggested 
that this change in plasma cytidine can be a surrogate measure of the CDA inhibitory effect of 
cedazuridine.

Distribution 
Tissue distribution was evaluated after oral dosing of [14C]-cedazuridine in non-pigmented (CD-1) and 
pigmented (C57BL/6) mice by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). Cedazuridine was 
rapidly absorbed and distributed to tissues but [14C]-cedazuridine did not overall show a strong 
tendency to distribute into tissues. In both C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice, the metabolic/excretory tissues as 
well as the tissues of the GI tract contained the highest distribution of [14C]-cedazuridine derived 
radioactivity. The tissues with higher relative distribution in both strains were large intestine wall, 
cecum mucosa, and entire kidney. In addition, urinary bladder wall and stomach wall glandular in 
C57BL/6, and small intestine wall and kidney medulla in CD-1 mice, had higher relative tissue 
distribution. The tissues with lowest relative levels of distribution found in both C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice 
were brain, spinal cord, eye lens, and white fat, which were all below quantifiable limit (BQL) at all 
sampled time points. Furthermore, no enhanced binding of cedazuridine to melanin containing tissues 
was observed in the skin or uveal tract in the pigmented as compared to the non-pigmented mice.  
The tissue:plasma AUC0-t ratios were <1.0 for liver (0.97) and bile (0.89) in comparison to the 
corresponding ratios in kidney (1.85) and urinary bladder wall (25.04), suggesting that a significant 
portion of the circulating radioactivity was likely excreted renally. 
The plasma protein binding of cedazuridine was low, 30-38%, across mouse, monkey and human. The 
plasma protein binding of decitabine was very low, 0-12% across mouse, rat, monkey, rabbit, and 
human. The similar level of plasma protein binding across the species tested facilitates interpretations 
of interspecies PK/PD and TK/toxicological comparisons. The in vitro blood-to-plasma partitioning ratio 
for cedazuridine, as measured by LC-MS/MS, was ranging from 0.87 to 0.91 in mouse, 0.69 to 0.91 in 
monkey, and 0.72 to 0.80 in human. These data suggest no concentration or species differences and 
that cedazuridine does not preferentially partition into blood cells. In vivo distribution studies with 
[14C]-cedazuridine detected by LSC confirmed the in vitro results. 
Metabolism 
Metabolic profiling in vivo showed that unchanged cedazuridine was the most abundant circulating 
entity followed by its epimer which was the most prominent circulating metabolite. All other 
metabolites were minor both in humans and animal models. Following oral administration of [14C]-
cedazuridine, the epimer was quantified to 37% of total radioactivity in female mice, and 33 and 
29.5% in male and female monkeys, respectively, as compared to 43.1% to 46.9% of the total drug-
related components in humans after receiving a RHD. No species-specific metabolites at a significant 
concentration were identified. Thus, toxicological coverage for metabolites is available as all 
metabolites detected in vivo in humans were also present in mouse and monkey plasma.  
Attempts with metabolic profiling in vitro revealed that [14C]-cedazuridine appeared to be 
metabolically stable in the liver S9 fractions and liver cytosols from mice, monkeys, and humans. The 
similar disappearance of cedazuridine in ex vivo incubations with or without the presence of 
hepatocytes, suggests a very low contribution of hepatic metabolism to cedazuridine clearance. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition and induction assays, and human transporter studies are 
presented in the clinical pharmacokinetic section. 
Excretion 
The urinary excretion of cedazuridine was evaluated in rats and monkeys after oral or intravenous 
administration of cedazuridine. In addition, the excretion profile of [14C]-cedazuridine was evaluated 
in single-dose mass balance studies in mice following oral dosing and in monkeys following oral and IV 
dosing. The levels of cedazuridine and cedazuridine epimer in the urine were quantified by LC-MS/MS 
Assessment report

methods. The concentrations of the epimer were estimated against the cedazuridine calibration curve 
as an epimer standard reference was not available.  
Following single IV administration of cedazuridine to rats at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, the mean percent of 
dose recovered as unchanged cedazuridine in urine was 57.6%, 67.5%, and 50.3%, respectively, with 
corresponding CLren of 403.03, 420.65, and 390.92 mL/h/kg. This is higher than the reported value 
for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in rats suggesting the involvement of active tubular transport. 
The percent of dose excreted in urine as the epimer averaged 25.9%, 6.7%, and 9.5%, while the 
respective CLren averaged 2196.03, 579.96, and 1154.33 mL/h/kg, which also suggests the 
involvement of active tubular secretion in the renal elimination of epimer. Following single oral 
administration of cedazuridine at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, the mean percent of dose recovered as 
unchanged cedazuridine in urine was 20.3%, 6.7%, and 5.6%, respectively, with corresponding CLren 
of 562.63, 484.00, and 418.62 mL/h/kg. Adjusting for the oral bioavailability, these values were in 
general considered consistent with the values observed after IV doses of cedazuridine, however, the 10 
mg/kg oral dose presented an approximate 3- to 4-fold increase in percent of cedazuridine dose 
excreted relative to the other dose groups, this was, largely due to high variability in one animal. The 
percent of dose excreted in urine as the epimer averaged 8.5%, 5.4%, and 4.1%, respectively, while 
the corresponding CLren averaged 740.36, 612.59, and 590.80 mL/h/kg. 
In monkeys cedazuridine was administered via a cross-over design (with a 7 to 21-day washout period 
between single IV and oral doses). Cedazuridine was administered orally to fasted animals with the 
exception of the 10 mg/kg dose for which urine parameters were measured only in fed animals. 
Following IV administration of 3 mg/kg cedazuridine, the mean percent of dose recovered as 
unchanged cedazuridine in urine was 37.9% with a CLren of 95.39 mL/h/kg. This CLren is 
approximately 40% of the GFR reported in monkeys. The percent of dose excreted in urine as the 
epimer of cedazuridine averaged 1.9%. Following oral administration of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg of 
cedazuridine, the mean percent of the dose recovered as unchanged cedazuridine in urine was 13.1%, 
6.3% (fed monkeys), and 10.2%, respectively, with corresponding CLren of 217.36, 218.37, and 
241.21 mL/h/kg, respectively. These values are approximately 2-fold higher than those observed 
following the 3 mg/kg IV dose of cedazuridine. The percentage of dose excreted as the epimer 
averaged 1.1%, 2.2%, and 2.9%, respectively, while the corresponding CLren at 10 and 30 mg/kg 
averaged 361.65 and 492.67 mL/h/kg, respectively (the CLren following 3 mg/kg IV or oral doses 
could not be calculated due to insufficient data). 
Mass balance data was obtained from mice and monkeys. In mice, approximately 93% of the dosed 
radioactivity was excreted by 168 hours post-dose in males and females (with most of the excretion 
occurring in the first 24 hours). The main route of excretion was through the faeces in which 
approximately 70% of dosed radioactivity was recovered. Approximately 20% and 18% of the dosed 
radioactivity was found to be excreted in the urine in males and females, respectively. In monkeys, ≥
64% of the administered dose was excreted in faeces over 7 days post-dose. The majority of 
radioactivity in urine, including cage rinse and faeces was recovered over the first 2 days post-dose 
(84.0% in males and 72.4% in females), with approximately 90.9% (males) and 89.8% (females) of 
the total administered dose recovered over 7 days post-dose. Approximately 2.2% and 3.4 % of the 
dosed radioactivity was found to be excreted in the faeces in males and females, respectively and 
approximately 48% and 47% in the urine in males and females, respectively.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
To support the marketing authorisation of ASTX727, a program of nonclinical toxicology studies was 
conducted including GLP-compliant oral toxicity studies for cedazuridine (in mice and monkeys) and 
decitabine (in mice and rats) and a non-GLP oral toxicity study for cedazuridine and decitabine 
administered together (in monkeys). Pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with cedazuridine 
evaluated up to 4 dosing cycles that included 7 dosing days per 28-day cycle, thereby covering the 
planned clinical treatment cycle of 5 consecutive dosing days followed by 23 non-dosing days. Pivotal 
studies conducted with decitabine evaluated 1 dosing cycle in mice and 1 and 4 dosing cycles in rats, 
with a dosing regimen that mimicked the planned clinical treatment cycle. The study conducted in 
monkeys with ASTX727 (cedazuridine and decitabine administered concurrently) evaluated 1 cycle of 
dosing that mimicked the planned clinical dosing cycle. As relevant, these studies included TK 
evaluations for cedazuridine, its major metabolite (cedazuridine epimer), and/or decitabine. The 
genotoxic potential of cedazuridine was evaluated in GLP-compliant in vitro and in vivo studies. No 
carcinogenicity studies, stand-alone reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, or local tolerance 
studies have been conducted with ASTX727 or with its active components, cedazuridine and 
decitabine. 
Mice and monkeys appear to have CDA tissue distribution and activity profiles that most closely 
resemble those of humans, making them appropriate species for the nonclinical evaluation of ASTX727 
and its active components. Specifically, like humans, mice and monkeys have high CDA activity levels 
in the GI tract and liver, although differences may exist among different strains of mice. High activity 
levels also have been reported in mouse and monkey kidney, while monkeys and humans also have 
high activity in both spleen and lung. In contrast, little to no CDA activity has been reported in any 
tissues of rats. Thus, relatively high oral bioavailability of decitabine occurs in the rat which makes it 
an ideal species in which to evaluate systemic effects of decitabine following oral administration. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Standard single-dose toxicity studies for ASTX727 or decitabine were not conducted.  
A non-GLP study was conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity and TK profile of cedazuridine 
administered orally (by gavage) for 5 days to male and female CD1 (ICR) mice at dose levels of 0 
[control; 0.5% methylcellulose (MC)], 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day (Study/Report No. S09032). There 
were no unscheduled deaths and no cedazuridine-related clinical signs after the first dose. 
A non-GLP study was conducted to investigate the potential toxicity and TK profile of cedazuridine 
following administration of single oral (gavage) escalating doses to male and female rhesus monkeys 
(Study/Report No. LFA00079). In this study, cedazuridine was administered on Day 1 at dose levels of 
0 (control; 0.5% MC), 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg (1/sex/group). No mortality was observed and there 
were no test article-related effects on body weight or food consumption. Soft faeces were noted in 1 
female at the 1000 mg/kg dose level. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Several pilot/non-pivotal studies exploring different doses and dosing regimens were investigated in 
the nonclinical program. Data from these studies were used to guide the design of the GLP and pivotal 
toxicology and TK studies. 
Clinical trials with ASTX727 have been conducted using an oral dosing schedule involving once daily 
dosing on Days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle and marketing approval is currently being sought for this 
dosing schedule. As such, the repeat-dose toxicity studies considered to be pivotal to supporting 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 27/130 
 
 
 
marketing approval of this dosing schedule are those in which the dosing schedule was the same or 
similar. 
Cedazuridine 
For cedazuridine, pivotal investigations evaluated the potential repeat-dose toxicity in 7-day studies in 
mice and monkeys and 13-week/4-cycle studies (with each cycle consisting of 7 consecutive dosing 
days and a 21-day treatment free period) in mice and monkeys.  
Administration of cedazuridine was not associated with test article-related mortalities in either the non-
pivotal or pivotal studies in mice or monkeys; however, severe bone marrow changes (i.e., severe 
leucopenia with neutropenia and lymphopenia and decreases in platelet counts) were noted in the non-
pivotal study in which monkeys received 300 or 1000 mg/kg/day of cedazuridine for 5 days. These 
bone marrow changes resulted in secondary infections, poor physical condition, and moribundity in 
monkeys at these dose levels. 
In the pivotal, GLP-compliant, 4-cycle oral toxicity studies in mice and monkeys (dosing on Days 1 to 7 
of each 28-day cycle for a total of 4 cycles), administration of cedazuridine was associated with bone 
marrow cytology changes as follows: 
• 
• 
In mice, dose levels of 1000 mg/kg/dose were associated with “mildly higher” 
myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratios in females and “minimally lower” M:E ratios in males. Mild 
to marked decreases in lymphocyte percentages and mild decreases in mean peripheral 
lymphocyte counts also were noted in both sexes. 
In monkeys, dose levels of 20 and 60 mg/kg/day were associated with mild morphologic 
changes in the erythroid lineage and a dose level of 200 mg/kg/day was associated with 
marked morphologic changes in the myeloid and erythroid lineages. 
The bone marrow cytology changes were associated with correlating histopathology in mice and 
monkeys. Reversibility of the bone marrow changes and histopathology findings were noted in both 
species following completion of the treatment-free recovery period. 
In addition to the bone marrow changes (and associated histopathology), the main toxicological 
findings associated with cedazuridine in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in mice and 
monkeys were adverse histopathology findings in the male and female reproductive tracts in mice and 
haematological effects and GI tract histopathology findings in monkeys. 
Decitabine 
For decitabine, pivotal investigations evaluated the potential repeat-dose toxicity in a 5-day study in 
mice, a 5-day study in rats, a 14-day study in rats, a 13-week/4-cycle study in rats and a 98-day/4-
cycle study in rats. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats, the key findings that were consistently associated 
with decitabine administration included thrombocytopenic changes (consisting of decreases in platelet 
counts), anaemic changes (consisting of decreases in RBCs, HCT, haemoglobin, and reticulocytes), and 
leucopenic changes [consisting of decreases in white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, neutrophils, 
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils]. In the pivotal, GLP-compliant 5-day (one-cycle) repeat-dose 
toxicity study, myelosuppression was noted at dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg/day while, in the pivotal, 
GLP-compliant 13-week/4-cycle repeat-dose toxicity study, this effect was noted at dose levels as low 
as 0.75 mg/kg/day, with the effects appearing to be more pronounced in males compared to females.

ASTX727 (cedazuridine and decitabine) 
Oral administration to monkeys resulted in increased systemic exposure to decitabine with increasing 
doses of cedazuridine, consistent with the intended inhibition of CDA by cedazuridine. In this non-GLP 
study, cedazuridine was administered at dose levels of 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day followed immediately by 
decitabine at a fixed dose level of 2 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days, both via oral gelatin capsules. 
The main toxicological findings noted in male and female monkeys included anaemia (decreases in RBC 
and WBC counts, haemoglobin, and HCT levels) and leucopenia (decreases in the levels of 
reticulocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) in treated animals and 
higher M:E ratios among the different groups of treated males (based on higher mean total myeloid 
cell counts and lower mean total erythroid cell counts). The changes in the haematology parameters 
were noted to be reversible following a 23-day treatment-free recovery period (i.e., at the end of the 
28-day cycle). 
Gastrointestinal toxicity was also observed and in males, testicular atrophy that did not reverse over 
the scheduled recovery periods.   
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Standard genotoxicity studies for ASTX727 or decitabine were not conducted. Nevertheless, the 
genotoxicity of decitabine is well known; Decitabine was mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo studies as 
per public available information. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma 
cells and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine- 
treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies.  
The potential genotoxicity of cedazuridine was investigated in a reverse mutation assay in bacteria, an 
in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes, an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, an 
in vivo comet assay in mice, and an in vivo phosphatidyl inositolglycan class A gene (pig-a) mutation 
assay in rats. 
•  Cedazuridine was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA1535 both in the presence and 
absence of external metabolic activation, but only at the highest tested concentration of 
5000 µg/plate, and was non-mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, and TA1535 
and in E. coli strain WP2 uvrA (pKM101) both in the presence and absence of external 
metabolic activation; 
•  Cedazuridine was genotoxic in a chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes both in 
the presence and absence of external metabolic activation;  
•  Cedazuridine was non-genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay; 
•  Cedazuridine was non-genotoxic in an in vivo mouse liver comet assay; and 
•  Cedazuridine did not induce mutagenic effects in circulating RBCs or reticulocytes in an in vivo 
pig-a mutation assay in rats. 
The positive genotoxicity findings noted in the human lymphocytes were generally only observed in the 
presence of significant cell toxicity (as indicated by a decrease in the relative mitotic index compared 
to concurrent controls). 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with ASTX727 or with its active components, 
cedazuridine and decitabine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 29/130 
 
 
 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In male mice given intraperitoneal injections of 0.15, 0.3, or 0.45 mg/m2 decitabine (approximately 
0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, testes weights were reduced, 
abnormal histology was observed, and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses ≥ 
0.3 mg/m2. In females mated to males dosed with ≥ 0.3 mg/m2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was 
reduced, and preimplantation loss was significantly increased. Decitabine was administered orally to 
male rats at 0.75, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/kg/day in cycles of 5- days- on/23- days- off for a total of 90 days. 
Low testes and epididymis weights, abnormal histology, and reduced sperm number were observed at 
doses ≥ 0.75 mg/kg (approximately ≥ 3 times the exposure in patients at the recommended clinical 
dose based on AUC).  
Cedazuridine was administered orally to male and female mice at 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day in 
cycles of 7- days- on/21- days- off for a total of 91 days. Adverse reactions including abnormal 
histology in the testes, epididymis, and ovaries, as well as reduced sperm numbers were observed at 
the 1,000 mg/kg dose (approximately 108 times the exposure in patients at the recommended clinical 
dose). These findings showed evidence of reversibility following 3 weeks off- dose. 
Teratogenic effects 
No stand-alone study on early embryonic development was performed with ASTX727 or with its 
components, decitabine and cedazuridine. This is line with IHC S9. 
Data from the literature also indicate that decitabine has adverse effects on all aspects of the 
reproductive cycle, including fertility, embryo-foetal development and post-natal development.  
Decitabine administration to neonatal/juvenile rats showed a comparable general toxicity profile as in 
older rats. Neurobehavioural development and reproductive capacity were unaffected when 
neonatal/juvenile rats were treated at dose levels inducing myelosuppression. 
2.5.4.1.  Phototoxicity 
Studies were performed to determine the ultraviolet absorption data for cedazuridine and decitabine, 
between 290 and 700 nm. In these studies, minimal absorption was observed within this range and the 
calculated molar extinction coefficient for any wavelength within this range was less than 1000 L mol-1 
cm -1. Based on these results, cedazuridine and decitabine are not expected to be phototoxic.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Inaqovi (ASTX727) consists of two active substances; cedazuridine, a cytidine deaminase inhibitor, and 
decitabine, a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor. An environmental risk assessment (ERA), phase I, was 
prepared for both substances.  
Inaqovi is indicated for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) which is a rare condition in the 
EU. AML is estimated to affect approximately 1.7 in 10,000 persons in the EU. 
Cedazuridine has a molecular weight of 268.21 g/mol and a log KOW of -0.55 at pH 6.8. The Phase I 
surface water PEC (PECSW) for cedazuridine was estimated using the maximum dose for cedazuridine of 
17.8 mg/day, to 0.0094 µg/L using a refined Fpen based on incidence (according to COMP). This is just 
below the 0.01 ug/L cut-off value.

Decitabine has the molecular weight of 228.21 g/mol and a log KOW of -1.50 at pH 6.8. The Phase I 
PECSW for decitabine was calculated using the maximum dose of 6.23 mg/day to 0.19 µg/L using a 
refined Fpen based on incidence (according to COMP) to 0.00053 µg/L.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In vivo administration of oral cedazuridine was demonstrated to enhance anti-tumour activity to oral 
decitabine, without providing any anti-tumour activity in itself both in a syngeneic and a 
xenotransplant mouse leukaemia model by increasing life span ranged from 41% to 88%. This provides 
preclinical support of the FDC treatment concept.  
Based on the results from the studies conducted with cedazuridine, any safety pharmacology concerns 
for ASTX727 are anticipated to be the result of potential effects of decitabine which has been in clinical 
use for many years. To conduct safety pharmacology studies with the combination, cedazuridine and 
decitabine co-administered, would not be meaningful since the boosting effect of cedazuridine on the 
known cytotoxic effects of decitabine occur at a much lower cedazuridine concentration than 
cedazuridine would cause acute toxic effect in itself. In addition, no overlapping toxicological findings 
from the two drug substances have been observed, and the adverse event profile of the combination is 
similar to decitabine monotherapy. This reasoning is agreed. 
The nonclinical pharmacology data package appears to support the rationale to us the oral FDC of 
cedazuridine and decitabine in the suggested disease indication.

Pharmacokinetics 
Of central importance for the ASTX727 fixed dose combination is that oral cedazuridine prevent the 
first-pass breakdown of the orally co-administered decitabine, significantly increase absorption and 
increase the plasma exposure levels as compared to oral decitabine alone and reach a similar exposure 
as following IV decitabine. This has been shown to occur in several preclinical studies. It appears also 
clear that oral cedazuridine pretreatment (30 min in mice, 1 or 2 hours in monkey), before oral 
administration of decitabine enhance the Cmax and AUC but have no major influence on t½ of 
decitabine in plasma in mice and monkeys. In terms of decitabine exposure, higher levels of decitabine 
were observed with increasing doses of cedazuridine. 
Some minor notes on Absorption: 
The exposure (AUCinf) to the epimer following oral administration of cedazuridine was noted to be 
approximately 30% of the exposure of the parent compound in mice while in rats and monkeys, the 
exposure to the epimer ranged from 51.5% to 62.7% and 28.3% to 38.7% of the parent compound 
exposure, respectively. The corresponding exposure to the epimer in human plasma following 
administration of RHD was 43.1 to 46.9% of total radioactivity. This indicates that the epimer was 
qualified for toxicological studies in all three tested species, mice, rats, and monkeys (further 
substantiated in the preclinical toxicology section).  
In the animal species, a larger formation of the epimer was observed following oral administration 
than IV administration which likely indicates that the formation of the epimer occurs prior to 
systemic absorption. This appears as a plausible explanation. 
The reduction in the exposures to cedazuridine in fed monkeys were likely a consequence of its 
decreased absorption from the GI tract, and not due to an increase in the formation of the epimer 
in the presence of food, as indicated by the similar AUCinf ratio of the cedazuridine epimer to the 
parent compound between fasted and fed animals (0.288 vs 0.221, respectively). This suggestion 
appears reasonable and is accepted. 
Since the level of distribution found in brain and spinal cord in both C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice were BQL 
at all sampled time points, there was less need for a brain penetration study.  
No enhanced binding of cedazuridine to melanin containing tissues was observed in the skin or uveal 
tract in the pigmented as compared to the non-pigmented mice. Thus, phototoxicity risk was not 
indicated (however, further discussed in the preclinical toxicology section).  
The mass balance studies indicates that the majority of oral cedazuridine is excreted unabsorbed in the 
faeces and the absorbed dose is primarily excreted renally. No studies examining excretion into bile 
have been conducted with cedazuridine, decitabine, or ASTX727, which is accepted. 
To summarise, the nonclinical pharmacokinetic profile of cedazuridine alone and in combination with 
decitabine is considered to have been adequately characterised. Mice and monkeys were used in the 
pivotal toxicological studies for cedazuridine. These species showed several qualitative similarities in 
metabolic profile with humans and are thus considered suitable for the evaluation of the toxicity of 
cedazuridine as NCE in the actual FDC.  
Toxicology 
The extent of the nonclinical toxicology program was agreed in the CHMP Scientific Advice 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/485806/2018 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 33/130 
 
 
 
 
A large number of non-pivotal toxicity studies were performed with cedazuridine and decitabine, in 
order to establish dose ranges for pivotal studies and to explore different treatment schedules. Toxicity 
findings in these studies were in line with what is seen in the pivotal studies.  
Administration of cedazuridine was not associated with test article-related mortalities in mice or 
monkeys. Overall, administration of cedazuridine to male and female mice and monkeys on a dosing 
schedule that was the same or similar to that which is proposed for clinical use of ASTX727 appears to 
be well-tolerated at dose levels of 100 mg/kg/dose in female mice, 300 mg/kg/dose in male mice, and 
60 mg/kg/dose in male and female monkeys. The main toxicological findings in both species were bone 
marrow cytology changes with correlating histopathology, adverse histopathology changes in the male 
and female reproductive tracts, and haematology changes (in monkeys). Most of these findings were 
at least partially reversed following a treatment-free recovery period. 
For decitabine, compound class-specific findings including thrombocytopenic changes, anaemic 
changes, and leucopenic changes as well as testicular toxicity were observed in rats following repeated 
oral dosing and were consistent with the lack or low level of CDA in this species. When cedazuridine 
and decitabine were administered together in a repeat-dose oral study in monkeys, increased 
decitabine exposure was observed and was associated with anaemia, leucopenia, and higher M:E 
ratios. These effects were reversible after a 23-day treatment-free recovery period. 
Toxicity findings with cedazuridine were observed only at exposures substantially above clinical 
exposure. It is likely that safety for this combination is driven mainly by the decitabine component with 
the cedazuridine only contributing by its ability to increase bioavailability for decitabine. The fact that 
the exposure to cedazuridine with the FDC is far below exposures where cedazuridine toxicity has been 
observed also serves to justify the absence of a formal combination toxicity study. 
A comprehensive evaluation of the genotoxicity of cedazuridine was performed to support clinical 
studies in healthy volunteers. While equivocal results were reported both in the Ames assay and in the 
chromosome aberration study, it is agreed that the in vivo studies performed supported that a 
genotoxic potential in patients is unlikely. Since decitabine is genotoxic, the importance of this 
conclusion is limited for this fixed dose combination. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with ASTX727 or with its components, cedazuridine 
and decitabine. Decitabine is genotoxic and a likely carcinogen and based on its positive genotoxicity, 
decitabine may be expected to have carcinogenic potential. As such, there is a carcinogenic risk 
associated with exposure to ASTX727.  Also, in line with ICH S9 carcinogenicity studies are not 
required for products indicated for the treatment of advanced cancer. 
No stand-alone reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with ASTX727 or 
with its components, decitabine and cedazuridine. Based on its mechanism of action, decitabine is 
expected to result in adverse reproductive effects. Studies with decitabine in rats showed testicular 
toxicity likely to indicate clinically relevant impairment of fertility. Studies with cedazuridine showed 
toxicity to both male and female reproductive tracts, but only at high exposure multiples. Therefore, 
decitabine is considered most important for fertility assessment and a text om SmPC 4.6 in line with 
the text for Dacogen is appropriate. For embryo-fetal development, reference is made to literature 
data supporting the Dacogen approval showing embryofetal toxicity in mice. Also for the SmPC text 
concerning pregnancy, a text in line with the text for Dacogen is considered appropriate. 
Both cedazuridine and decitabine showed minimal light absorption at wavelengths between 290 and 
700 nm: Based on these results, cedazuridine and decitabine are not expected to be phototoxic.

Environmental risk assessment 
Cedazuridine PEC surfacewater value is just below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and it is not a PBT 
substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, cedazuridine is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
Decitabine PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, decitabine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Inaqovi (ASTX727) is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing 35 mg decitabine and 100 mg 
cedazuridine that is intended to provide decitabine exposures equivalent to intravenous (IV) decitabine 
at the European Union (EU)-approved dose. 
Cedazuridine (E7727), is a novel cytidine deaminase [CDA] inhibitor). It is a new chemical entity and 
the pharmacokinetic studies should thus aim at describing the disposition and also to identify 
subgroups where an increased or decreased exposure can be expected based on the pharmacokinetic 
properties. Potential interactions based on the pharmacokinetic properties should also be evaluated. 
Administration of cedazuridine with oral decitabine reduces first pass metabolism of decitabine upon 
absorption, thus enhancing the oral bioavailability of decitabine so that oral administration is feasible. 
Decitabine is a known substance, previously approved for intravenous administration at a dose of 20 
mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 consecutive days (i.e., a total of 5 
doses per treatment cycle). This application is based on a PK bridge, assuming that previous efficacy 
Assessment report

Page 36/130 
 
 
 
 
 
and safety data for IV decitabine can be extrapolated to Inaqovi if the decitabine plasma exposure 
(total AUC over the 5-day cycle) is similar. 
Cedazuridine has one major metabolite, its epimer. The epimer has been reported to be 1/10th as 
active as cedazuridine in CDA inhibition and has similar or lower exposure than cedazuridine. It is thus 
not expected to significantly contribute to the effect of cedazuridine. Rather, conversion to the epimer 
will lead to lower effect.   
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods 
Validated methods were used for determination of decitabine, cedazuridine and cedazuridine-epimer in 
plasma  and for determination of cedazuridine and cedazuridine-epimer in urine. 
Population PK 
The population PK analysis is mainly used to inform on the impact of covariates on the exposure of 
decitabine and cedazuridine. 
Previously developed population PK models (IV decitabine, oral decitabine and oral cedazuridine; 
Figure 1) were combined to describe the PK of decitabine and cedazuridine given alone and in 
combination, and for the IV and oral formulation of decitabine. The semi-mechanistic model was 
initially developed on data from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This modelling 
analysis focused on re-estimating model parameters using the available AML data, evaluating the 
influence of covariates, and subsequently comparing disease population-specific model 
parameterisations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 37/130 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Semi-Mechanistic Population PK Model development Schematic 
The dataset included data from AML (N=87) and MDS (N=243) patients from the phase 1, 2, and 3 
studies Missing PK observations, PK observations with missing preceding dose information, and PK 
observation values below the quantifiable limit (BQL) were excluded from the analysis. The covariates 
of interest included sex (221 males, 109 females), age (32-92 years), baseline body weight (41-158 
kg), and use of PPI at any time during the study (235 No, 95 Yes). In addition, renal function based on 
normalised CrCL, and hepatic function based on bilirubin values followed the NCI guidance, were 
investigated. Although the dataset (and all provided summaries of the data) included data from both 
AML and MDS patients, during this analysis the model was only fitted to data from AML patients. 
The final models (decitabine and cedazuridine) included covariate effects of height, with a fixed 
exponent (0.75), on the liver blood flow and volumes. In addition, in the cedazuridine model, covariate 
effects of sex and CrCL were estimated on ktr and CL, respectively (Table 12), and in the decitabine 
model, covariate effects of body weight and sex were estimated on CLH and Q (simultaneously 
estimated), as well as Vc and ka (only effect of sex; Table 13 and Table 14).

Absorption  
Both cedazuridine and decitabine can be classified as highly soluble substances according to the BCS 
classification. 
After oral administration of Inaqovi in the Phase 3 Study ASTX727-02 NA MDS/CMML, the median tmax 
was 1 hour (range, 0.3 to 3 hours) for decitabine and 3 hours (range, 0.52 to 7.9 hours) for 
cedazuridine. 
In vitro permeability for decitabine or cedazuridine was not specifically discussed by the applicant, but 
in the Caco-2 cell study Papp values for cedazuridine were much lower than those of the high-
permeability control antipyrine. Cedazuridine is not a P-gp substrate. 
Study ASTX727-01-A (dose escalation and absolute bioavailability of decitabine) 
This was a single-arm, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of concomitant 
orally administered cedazuridine plus decitabine in adult subjects with MDS or CMML. Treatment was 
given in 28-day cycles and included single-dose oral decitabine (on Day −3 of Cycle 1), decitabine by 
1-hour IV infusion administered at 20 mg/m2 (Cycle 1 Day 1), single dose of oral cedazuridine (on Day 
−3 of Cycle 2), and cedazuridine plus decitabine administered concomitantly as separate oral capsules 
(on Days 2 to 5 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 to 5 of Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles). Doses of 
cedazuridine/decitabine (in mg) were 40/20, 60/20, 100/20, 100/40, and 100/30 for Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 
4, and 5, respectively.  
In total 44 subjects with MDS or CMML were randomised and treated in the study. The median age was 
71.5 years (range 59-86 years), most subjects were male (68%) and median body weight was 83.7 kg 
(range 51.1-145.6 kg).

A rapid oral absorption of decitabine was determined in MDS/CMML patients, followed by a rapid 
decline at 4-6 hours post dose across the dose levels tested. Total and peak exposure of oral 
decitabine were consistently lower on Day –3 when administered alone compared with Day 2 or Day 5 
when administered in combination with cedazuridine. The lower increase in oral decitabine AUC0-t on 
Day 2 (the first combination dose with cedazuridine) compared to Day 5 is likely due to less 
cedazuridine present systemically.  
The absolute bioavailability of oral decitabine dosed alone was low, ranging from 9%-19%. 
Coadministration of cedazuridine resulted in enhanced oral bioavailability of decitabine in every subject 
with an increase of AUC0-t ranging from approximately 4-7 fold on day 2 and 7-12 fold on Day 5.

Correspondingly, the decitabine mean oral bioavailability (dose-normalised AUC-ratio compared to IV 
treatment) improved and was 111% for Day 2, and 146% for Day 5 in Cohort 4.  
Cmax values for oral decitabine when dosed alone were markedly lower than for IV decitabine. 
Decitabine Cmax increased with coadministration of cedazuridine. 
Geometric mean ratios of 81% and 128% for decitabine oral AUC/decitabine IV AUC were achieved 
with cedazuridine/decitabine doses of 100/30 and 100/40 mg, respectively. This supported the 
selection of an intermediate dose of decitabine between 30 and 40 mg (i.e., 35 mg) in combination 
with 100 mg cedazuridine for further testing. The dose of 35 mg decitabine corresponds to the IV dose 
of 20mg/m2 (with a BSA of 1.73 m2) recommended for Dacogen. 
Co-administration of decitabine with cedazuridine did not appear to alter cedazuridine plasma PK at the 
relevant dose of 100 mg. No differences on absorption parameters (Cmax or tmax) were observed 
when cedazuridine was administered alone or in combination with decitabine. 
Study ASTX727-01-B (dose confirmation study) 
ASTX727-01-B was a Phase 2, open-label, randomised, 2-cycle, 2-sequence crossover study followed 
by a single-arm continuation of treatment conducted in 2 stages to assess the PK, safety, and efficacy 
of cedazuridine (100 mg) and decitabine (35 mg) administered concomitantly as separate capsules (in 
the Dose Confirmation Stage) and as the ASTX727 FDC tablet (in the FDC Stage). 86 Subjects with 
MDS or CMML were randomised to receive the investigational product Daily ×5 in Cycle 1 followed by 
IV decitabine Daily ×5 in Cycle 2 (Sequence A), or the same treatments in the reverse order 
(Sequence B). 80 subjects received treatment.  
Results 
Concomitant oral administration of cedazuridine (100 mg) with decitabine (35 mg) as separate 
capsules and as the Inaqovi FDC tablet showed similar exposure to that of IV decitabine (20 mg/m2). 
The ratio (oral/IV) of geometric LSM (93.52 in Dose Confirmation Stage; 97.59 in FDC Stage) and its 
80% CI (82.10, 106.5 in Dose Confirmation Stage; 80.48, 118.3 in FDC Stage) were fully contained 
within the prespecified CI limits for each stage. Steady state was reached with the second dose of the 
oral combination (Day 2), as decitabine exposures on Days 2 and 5 were comparable (ratio of 0.98 
between days 2 and 5). The T1/2 was slightly higher (1.3-1.4 h) when co-administered with 
cedazuridine at day 2 and 5 compared to 1.08 h for decitabine IV.  
Study E7727-01 (Period 1, Absolute bioavailability of cedazuridine) 
Study E7727 (period 1) was a phase I, mass balance, absolute bioavailability study with 8 subjects (5 
male and 3 female). Subjects were given a non-radiolabelled single oral 100 mg dose (capsule) of 
cedazuridine in the fasted state, followed by an intravenous microtracer dose of 14C- cedazuridine. 
Plasma samples were taken up to 72 hours post oral dose and urine was collected up to 72 hours post 
dose for determination of cedazuridine and 14C- cedazuridine.  
Results 
The mean (SD) absolute bioavailability of cedazuridine was 20.7% (4.3%), following an oral dose of 
100 mg E7727 capsule formulation in the fasted state and intravenous administration of a microtracer 
dose of 100 µg [14C]-E7727. 
Relative bioavailability 
The final commercial formulation was used in study ASTX727-02 EU and ASTX727-02 NA and also in 
study ASTX727-04 (food effect study). Separate cedazuridine and decitabine capsules were used in 
study ASTX727-01-A and an early formulation of the ASTX727 tablet (35 mg decitabine and 100 mg

cedazuridine) was manufactured for the Phase 2 FDC Stage of the ASTX727-01 study (ASTX727-01-B). 
It is concluded that the ASTX727 tablets used in the Phase 3 study (in subjects with MDS/CMML and 
AML) were not substantially different from the ASTX727 tablets used in the Phase 2 study and that no 
bioequivalence study was necessary between the 2 different formulations. 
ASTX727-02 EU (AML) Pivotal Phase 3 study 
ASTX727-02 EU was a Pivotal Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence 
crossover study comparing decitabine AUC equivalence of ASTX727 and IV decitabine. Adult subjects 
with AML who were candidates to receive IV decitabine at 20 mg/m2 were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive the ASTX727 FDC tablet Daily×5 in Cycle 1, followed by IV decitabine 20 mg/m2 Daily×5 in 
Cycle 2 (Sequence A), or the converse order (Sequence B). Adequate PK assessments from both cycles 
were required for subjects to be evaluable for analysis of the primary endpoint. After completion of the 
first 2 treatment cycles, subjects continued to receive treatment with Inaqovi in 28-day cycles until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the subject decided to discontinue treatment or was 
withdrawn from the study. Subjects were permitted to have only clear liquids (no food or non-clear 
liquids) for 2 hours before and 2 hours after administration of ASTX727. Pharmacokinetics were 
evaluated on Days 1 through 5 during the cycle of ASTX727 administration (serial collections on Days 
1, 2, and 5), and on Days 1, 3, and 5 during the cycle of IV decitabine administration (serial collections 
on Days 1 and 5). Blood-samples were collected pre-dose and until 24 h after ASTX727 treatment and 
until 8h after IV decitabine. 
Total 5-day oral decitabine AUC0-24 exposures were calculated as follows using PK data from 3 days of 
serial PK sampling: Day 1 AUC0-24 (first ASTX727 dose) + (Day 2 AUC0-24 + Day 5 AUC0-24) × 2.  
Decitabine 5-day AUC0-24 exposures after IV decitabine was calculated as follows: (Day 1 AUC0-24 + 
Day 5AUC0-24) / 2 x 5. 
A total of 89 subjects were randomised in the study. Of the 87 subjects who received treatment the 
median age was 78 years (range 61-92 years), most subjects were male (60.9%) and median body 
weight was 73.7 kg (range 46-117 kg). There was a total of 69 subjects that completed the first 2 
cycles with sufficient PK samples that were fully evaluable for the primary analysis of the primary 
study endpoint.  
Results 
ASTX727 given as an FDC of 35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine achieved AUC exposures 
equivalent to IV infusion of decitabine at 20 mg/m2. The 5-Day AUC0-24 percentage ratio (oral/IV) of 
geometric LSM was 99.64% (90% CI 91.23%, 108.8%); the 2 sided 90% CI was contained entirely 
within the prespecified range of 80% to 125%, see Table 17.

Results of the secondary analyses of AUC0-8, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf further supported the primary analysis 
of 5-Day AUC0 24. 
Following multiple oral administrations of ASTX727 on Day 2 and Day 5, geoCV% plasma decitabine 
AUC0-24 values (194 ng*h/mL [59.6%] and 187 ng*h/mL [57.5%] at steady state for Day 2 and Day 5, 
respectively) were comparable to AUC0-24 values following IV decitabine (175 ng*h/mL [55.1%] and 
180 ng*h/mL [58.2%] on Day 1 and Day 5, respectively. 
Cmax was consistently lower for ASTX727 compared to IV decitabine; on Day 1 the difference was 54% 
and on Day 5 28%. AUC0-24 day 1 was also lower for ASTX727 compared to IV decitabine. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of decitabine and cedazuridine are presented in Table 18 and Table 19 
respectively.

ASTX727-02 NA (MDS and CMML) Supportive Phase 3 study 
ASTX727-02 NA (MDS and CMML) was included in the application as a supportive study. The general 
study design was same as for ASTX727-2 EU (AML). However, Subjects were not permitted to take 
gastric pH altering drugs for 4 hours before and for 4 hours after ASTX727 dosing, due to the possible 
interference with decitabine absorption from ASTX727.  
In total 138 subjects with MDS or CMML were randomised in the study. Of the 133 subjects who 
received treatment the median age was 71 years (range 44-88 years), most subjects were male 
(65.4%) and median body weight was 83.1 kg (range 45-158 kg). Of the 133 subjects treated, 123 
completed the first 2 cycles with sufficient PK samples that were fully evaluable for the primary 
analysis of the primary study endpoint.  
Results 
The primary analysis showed that the 5-Day AUC0-24 percentage ratio of geometric LSM for ASTX727 
relative to IV decitabine was 98.93% (90% CI 92.66%, 105.6%). The 2 sided 90% CI was contained 
entirely within the prespecified range of 80% to 125% for the primary analysis. All sensitivity and 
secondary analyses that included additional subjects (N between 124 and 131 subjects for paired and 
unpaired comparisons) confirmed that the 2-sided 90% CI of the geometric LSM ratio was contained 
entirely within 80% to 125%. 
Results of the secondary analyses (area under the concentration time curve from time zero to 8 hours 
postdose [AUC0-8], AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf) further supported the primary analysis of 5-Day AUC0-24.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of decitabine and cedazuridine are presented in Table 20 and Table 21

on the pharmacokinetics of ASTX727 in subjects with all subtypes of MDS, CMML and AML. Subjects

received one tablet of ASTX727 containing 100 mg cedazuridine and 35 mg decitabine once daily for 5 
days in 28-day cycles starting from Cycle 1 Day 1.  
18 subjects were randomised (17 treated, 16 included in PK population) in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 
high-calorie, high-fat breakfast meal pre-dose at steady state (which is achieved on Day 2) on either 
Day 2 or Day 4 of Cycle 1. Comparison of data for fed vs fasted was performed using equivalence 
analysis on the combined data from Days 2+4.  
Results 
Cedazuridine and cedazuridine-epimer exposure parameters were approximately 10% and 20% higher, 
respectively, following a high-fat meal compared to those following fasted conditions. Tmax occurred 
slightly later (approximately 0.5 hour). 
Decitabine exposure parameters were approximately 40% (AUC) to 53.5% (Cmax) lower following a 
high-fat meal compared to those following fasted conditions. However, as data from this study were 
deemed to be too variable to conclude a definitive effect on decitabine, an additional study to evaluate 
the effect of food (high-calorie/high-fat meal, or low-calorie/light meal) is currently ongoing as a post-
marketing commitment with FDA (a substudy of ASTX727-06) and is expected to be submitted to the 
EMA post approval when final and available. 
It is currently recommended that ASTX727 should be administered in the fasted state, on an empty 
stomach with no food intake 2 hours before and following administration of the ASTX727 tablet. 
Distribution 
After oral administration of ASTX727 in the Phase 3 Studies ASTX727-02 EU (AML) and NA 
(MDS/CMML), the geometric mean (CV) V/F on Day 5 was 373L (68.9%) and 417 L (54%) for 
decitabine, respectively.  
The volume of distribution (Vz/F) for cedazuridine was approximately 339 L after oral administration 
and after IV administration, the volume of distribution (V) was approximately 54 L (study E7727-01). 
In the phase III studies (ASTX727 02-B MDS/CMML NA and ASTX727-02-C AML EU) similar Vz/F of 
296L and 278L, respectively, was shown. 
Cedazuridine and decitabine were both observed to have low plasma protein binding in vitro 
(approximately 35% and 5% respectively). The major metabolite cedazuridine-epimer also had very 
low plasma protein binding in vitro (0%). 
Based on in vitro-data, the mean blood/plasma ratio of cedazuridine in human blood was 0.76 and thus 
did not indicate preferential partition into blood cells. In the human mass-balance study, the 
blood/plasma ratio was 1.07 at 12 hours post-dose indicating some binding of cedazuridine to red 
blood cells. 
Metabolism 
No new in vitro metabolism data for decitabine has been submitted.  
Five metabolites were identified in urine after SC administration of [14C]-guadecitabine (pro-drug of 
decitabine). Three of these were also identified in plasma (study SGI-110-05). 
In vitro metabolism of cedazuridine was investigated in hepatocytes and in liver S9 fractions and liver 
cytosols. As no in vitro metabolism was observed in these systems, the Applicant did not continue with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 48/130 
 
 
 
additional studies in order to determine which enzyme that was responsible for the metabolism. 
Results indicate that cedazuridine is not subject to hepatic metabolism. 
In plasma, approximately 99% of all drug-related entities following oral administration of 14C-
cedazuridine consisted of three major products present; parent cedazuridine (58.7% of total drug-
related material), the cedazuridine-epimer (30.9%) and metabolite M266/1 (9.7%) (study E7727-01). 
The cedazuridine-epimer is a major metabolite that needs further characterisation, no other 
metabolites need further investigations due to its low presence (below 10%). 
The mean terminal t1/2 of total radioactivity in plasma was 10.9 hours while the half-life for parent drug 
and epimer was about 8.4 hours, indicating presence of metabolites that have a longer half-life than 
parent drug. 
Following IV administration, the exposure of parent drug cedazuridine in plasma was about 3-fold that 
of the epimer. 
Metabolite profiling in plasma was also performed in study ASTX727-01. Cedazuridine accounted for 
48.7% to 51.5% of the total drug related components. Cedazuridine-epimer was the most abundant 
metabolite/conversion product, accounting for 43.1% to 46.9% of the total drug-related components, 
while the other metabolites were relatively minor, each accounting for ≤2.9% of the total drug-related 
components. 
The total amount of cedazuridine and cedazuridine-epimer extracted in urine following non-
radiolabelled oral administration was reported to be 17.1 mg (17.1 %) and 17.5 mg (17.5 %) of the 
total dose.  
Following a radiolabelled oral dose of cedazuridine, on average 45.7 % and 51.2% was recovered in 
urine and faeces, respectively. In urine, 20.7% of the total dose was extracted as cedazuridine and 
13.8% as cedazuridine-epimer. In faeces, over 20% of the administered dose was in non-extractable 
material and the recovery of the method was reported to be low. Of the total administered dose, 
14.8% was found to be cedazuridine and 11.6 % was found to be cedazuridine-epimer.  
Based on the identification of metabolites from the human mass balance study (E7727-01), a proposed 
metabolic pathway of cedazuridine (E7727) in human plasma is depicted in Figure 5.

Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Cedazuridine has one major metabolite, the epimer. The epimer has been reported to be 1/10th as 
active as cedazuridine in CDA inhibition and has similar or lower exposure than cedazuridine. It is thus 
not expected to significantly contribute to the effect of cedazuridine. Rather, conversion to the epimer 
will lead to lower effect. 
Cedazuridine-epimer pharmacokinetic profile largely followed that of cedazuridine, but circulating levels 
were at approximately 26% to 52% of cedazuridine (study ASTX727-01-A). In the phase III studies 
ASTX727-02 EU (AML) and NA (MDS/CMML) cedazuridine-epimer to parent (cedazuridine) ratios (EPR) 
for Cmax, AUC0-8 and AUC0-24 were approximately 0.55 (EU) and 0.45 (NA), following a single dose on 
Day 1, and multiple doses on Day 5. 
Interconversion 
Cedazuridine can be converted to its epimer, which is considered a major metabolite of decitabine.  
Elimination 
After a single oral dose of ASTX727 in the Phase 3 Study ASTX727-02 NA MDS/CMML, the geometric 
mean (CV) t1/2 of decitabine was 1.2 hours (23%); the CL/F was 342 L/h at Day 1 and 197 L/h at 
steady state. 
Based on study E7727-01 (period 1, IV tracer dose), CL for cedazuridine (geometric mean [min-max]) 
was 5.67 L/h (4.23-7.82). The apparent clearance (CL/F) after the oral administration of 100-mg 
(capsule) was 28.0 L/h (min-max 22.4-48.3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023

After a single oral dose of ASTX727 in the Phase 3 Study ASTX727-02 NA MDS/CMML, the geometric 
mean (CV) t1/2 of cedazuridine was 6.33 hours (18%); the CL/F was 30.6 L/h at Day 1 and 25.6 L/h at 
steady state. Based on the t1/2 observed for cedazuridine, it would be expected to clear systemically to 
below detection levels within 48 to 72 hours. 
Mass balance 
Study SG-110-05 (mass balance study for guadecitabine, prodrug of decitabine) 
Data from study SG-110-05 were included in this application as supportive evidence for 
characterisation of mass balance and excretion pathways for decitabine. This was Phase I study with 
guadecitabine, a prodrug of decitabine. Guadecitabine was administered (SC) on days 1 to 5 of a 28-
day cycle, with the last dose being radiolabelled.  
After SC administration of [14C]-guadecitabine with the radiolabel on the decitabine structure, the 
mean total excretion of drug related material up to the last point of collection was 90.5%, with 90.2% 
being excreted in urine and 0.4% in faeces. The mean half-life of decitabine on day 5 was 0.95h. Both 
guadecitabine and decitabine were almost completely metabolised before excretion, with <1% of 
cumulative excretion of unchanged drug in urine for both compounds. 
Study E7727-01 (Mass balance study for cedazuridine) 
This was a Phase I single-dose mass balance study conducted in 8 healthy volunteers (5 male and 3 
female) in the fasted state. In period 1 subjects received a single oral dose of 100 mg and a single IV 
microdose (100 μg 14C-E7727) as a bolus injection. In period 2 of this study, subjects received a single 
oral dose of 100 mg 14C-E7727 for assessment of mass balance.  
The arithmetic mean recovery after a single IV dose of 100 μg 14C-E7727 (period 1) was 81.4%; the 
major route of excretion of 14C-radioactivity was via urine (80.9%) whereas only a limited amount was 
excreted via faeces (0.6%).  
Upon oral dosing (period 2) with 100 mg 14C-E7727, the mean total recovery was 96.9% (ranging 
between 93.2% and 100.2%) over the 120-hour collection interval with most of the administered 
radioactivity recovered in urine and feces in the first 72 hours postdose (92.2%). The renal clearance 
(CLr) was 4.46 L/h (ranging between 3.01 and 5.47 L/h). The amount of total 14C-radioactivity was 
somewhat higher in feces (mean of 51.2%) than in urine (mean of 45.7%), indicating that a 
substantial part of the compound dosed orally may not be absorbed. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
An approximately dose proportional increase of decitabine peak and total exposure was seen in the 
dose range of 20 mg to 40 mg when co-administered with 100 mg cedazuridine (study ASTX727-01-
A). 
A less than dose proportional increase of cedazuridine peak and total exposure was seen in the dose 
range of 100 mg to 400 mg (study E7727-02). In the range of 40 mg to 100 mg the increase of 
cedazuridine peak and total exposure is approximately dose proportional, with 1.9-fold increases in 
AUC and 2.1-fold increases in Cmax at day 5 (study ASTX727-01-A). 
After concomitant oral administration of decitabine and cedazuridine capsules, mean decitabine Cmax 
and AUC was lower on Day 1 than on Days 2 and 5. Steady state was reached with the second dose of 
the oral combination. Mean decitabine t1/2 following concomitant oral administration of decitabine and 
cedazuridine was slightly higher compared with IV.  Mean decitabine apparent clearance (CL/F) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023

decreased after multiple doses of concomitant oral administration of decitabine and cedazuridine. This 
is consistent with the steady state of interaction effect of cedazuridine on decitabine being reached on 
Day 2. The accumulation ratio on day 5 compared to day 1 was approximately 1.7 to 1.8. 
For cedazuridine the accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUC0-8 were in the range of 0.94 to 1.6 
(ASTX727-01-A). 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the phase I study (ASTX727-01-A), with 6 subjects per cohort, the inter-subject variability was 
higher for orally compared to intravenously administered decitabine. In phase III study (AST727-02-EU 
AML), with a higher number of subjects, the inter-subject variability of oral decitabine AUC and Cmax 
exposure parameters was moderate to high (ranging between 54.4% and 62.7%) and similar to inter-
subject variability following IV decitabine infusion. 
In the phase III study (ASTX727-02-C EU AML), Inter-subject variability for cedazuridine PK exposure 
(AUC and Cmax) parameters following oral administration of ASTX727 was generally low to moderate, 
ranging between 42.0% to 49.8%. 
In the phase III study ASTX727-02 EU, the estimated intra-subject CV for Cmax was approximately 
30% for both oral decitabine and cedazuridine. For AUC the intra-subject CV was in the range 23-30% 
for decitabine (both oral and IV) and for cedazuridine. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
All studies with decitabine were performed in patients with either AML or MDS/CMML; two studies with 
cedazuridine only (mass balance and thorough QT) were performed in healthy volunteers.  
The decitabine exposure after administration of ASTX727 determined by NCA was compared 
graphically for subjects in the MDS/CMML population and the AML population. The primary analysis of 
decitabine 5 Day AUC0-24 showed no apparent difference in exposure between the 2 populations (Figure 
6). There was also no apparent difference in cedazuridine exposure in AML versus MDS/CMML 
population based on graphical comparison.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
No dedicated PK study has been performed investigating the effect of renal impairment on decitabine 
or cedazuridine exposure.  
Most subjects in study ASTX727-02 EU (AML patients) had either mild or moderate renal impairment. 
In the study in the MDS/CMML population, most patients had normal renal function but there were also 
a rather large proportion of patients with mild and some with moderate renal impairment. Combining 
both studies, patients with normal (N=65), mild (N=129) and moderate (N=103) renal impairment 
were included (defined based on absolute GFR). Observed data is presented graphically separately for 
the AML and MDS/CMML populations respectively. There is a trend that cedazuridine exposure slightly 
increases with decreasing CrCL. In the MDS/CMML population there is also a trend of slight increase in 
decitabine exposure with decreasing CrCL, in particular for oral treatment. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No dedicated PK study has been performed investigating the effect of hepatic impairment on decitabine 
or cedazuridine exposure.  
Very few AML patients with impaired liver function were included in the study. Some MDS/CMML 
patients had mild liver impairment (defined based only on bilirubin values, ULN to 1.5×ULN) but very 
few had moderate impairment (defined based only on bilirubin values, 1.5 to 3×ULN).

Sex, race/ethnicity, weight, age 
Exploratory graphical analyses of sex and decitabine and cedazuridine exposures identified a potential 
correlation for oral decitabine but this effect was not clinically meaningful. 
There were insufficient data to evaluate a potential race covariate. 
There is a trend of decreased decitabine 5-day AUC0-24 with increasing weight or BSA with oral 
decitabine treatment. This is not considered to be clinically relevant (Figure 7).

Based on observed data, there seems to be a trend of increased cedazuridine exposure with increasing 
age. There is also a trend of increased decitabine exposure with increasing age, at least for oral 
treatment. The number of older subjects included in studies is summarised below.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Decitabine 
Effect of decitabine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (decitabine as perpetrator) 
Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. Decitabine did not affect the 
exposure of cedazuridine at a dose of 100 mg. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of decitabine (decitabine as victim) 
Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. Decitabine is metabolised by CDA 
and the CDA inhibitor cedazuridine significantly increases the exposure of decitabine as discussed 
below. Other CDA inhibitors could also increase the exposure of decitabine. 
Cedazuridine 
Effect of cedazuridine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (cedazuridine as 
perpetrator) 
No specific study of the effect of cedazuridine on the PK of other drugs (except decitabine) has been 
conducted. Cedazuridine is an inhibitor of CDA and it has been demonstrated that cedazuridine 
significantly affects the exposure of the CDA substrate decitabine, giving up to 12-fold increase in 
decitabine exposure (study ASTX727-01). It would thus affect the metabolism and exposure of any 
coadministered drug that is metabolised via this route.  
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of cedazuridine (cedazuridine as victim) 
No specific study of the effect of other drugs on the PK of cedazuridine has been conducted. Based on 
study ASTX727-01, decitabine does not affect the exposure of cedazuridine at a dose of 100 mg.  
Concomitant PPI medication was assessed as a potential covariate in the PopPK model because of the 
possibility that such medications could affect the rate of conversion of cedazuridine into its much less 
effective epimer. This assessment showed that concomitant PPI medication usage did not have a 
significant impact on decitabine, cedazuridine, and cedazuridine-epimer parameters and subsequent 
exposures (Figure8), suggesting that drugs modifying gastric pH are unlikely to affect the PK of 
cedazuridine or decitabine after ASTX727 administration.

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Decitabine 
The plasma protein binding of decitabine is low and based on previous data, decitabine is not a 
substrate for CYP enzymes. Decitabine did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes and did not inhibit P-gp. 
New in vitro-data was submitted investigating inhibition of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP by decitabine at 
concentrations relevant for intestinal inhibition (60 µM), considering that decitabine is now 
administered orally instead of intravenously. There was no signal of in vivo relevant inhibition of P-gp, 
BCRP or CYP3A4 by decitabine at concentrations relevant for intestinal inhibition (all IC50-values being 
> 100 µM).  
Cedazuridine 
Effects of cedazuridine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (cedazuridine as 
perpetrator) 
The following cut-offs have been used for cedazuridine for assessment of interaction potential in vivo: 
a) Input parameters were Cmax 349 ng/ml (study ASTX727-02, MDS population), fu = 0.65, Mw = 
268.21 g/mol. Based on an additional in vitro plasma protein binding study (fu=1) the cut-offs would 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 56/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
instead be 65 µM (50xCmax,u) and 194 µM (25xinlet Cmax,u) but using these cut-offs instead would not 
change conclusions. 
b) Input parameters F = 0.21 (study E7727-01), ka = 0.1 min-1, blood/plasma ratio 0.76 
c) Dose = 100 mg 
Based on in vitro data, there was no signal of in vivo relevant competitive CYP inhibition by 
cedazuridine. For all studied enzymes (CYP 1A, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A), less than 
50% inhibition was observed at the highest studied concentration of 400 µM. This results in a Ki value 
of > 200 µM which is below both the systemic cut-off and the cut-off relevant for inhibition of intestinal 
CYP3A4. There was also no clinically relevant time-dependent CYP inhibition by cedazuridine. 
A study investigating potential of cedazuridine to induce the activity of CYP enzymes did not indicate 
significant induction. 
Cedazuridine was observed to be an inhibitor of CDA based on in vitro-data.  
Based on in vitro data, there was no signal of in vivo relevant inhibition by cedazuridine on P-gp, BCRP, 
BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, CNT1, CNT2, CNT3, ENT1 or ENT2. 
Based on in vitro-data, the major metabolite cedazuridine-epimer does not cause clinically relevant 
CYP inhibition (cut-off below 50 µM and for all studied enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 
3A4) the IC50 values were above 100 µM). 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of cedazuridine (cedazuridine as victim) 
In in vitro studies, cedazuridine was not metabolised by human liver S9 fractions or liver cytosols. 
These results indicate that cedazuridine is not subject to hepatic metabolism including metabolism by 
CYP enzymes. 
Cedazuridine is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 
or MATE2-K. It is however a substrate of the transporters CNT1, CNT3, and ENT2.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Three clinical studies in subjects with AML (Study ASTX727-02 EU AML) and MDS/CMML (Studies 
ASTX727-01, ASTX727-02 NA MDS/CMML, and ASTX727-04) have contributed to the characterisation 
of the clinical pharmacology of cedazuridine with decitabine in this submission, and 2 clinical studies in 
healthy subjects (Studies E7727-01 and E7727-02) have contributed to the characterisation of 
cedazuridine. 
Mechanism of action 
Decitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after 
phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing 
hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation and/or apoptosis. Decitabine- induced 
hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the 
control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of 
decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase 
and decitabine incorporated into DNA. 
Decitabine is a substrate of cytidine deaminase (CDA) which has been shown to have high activity 
levels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver of humans. CDA deaminates decitabine and other 
therapeutic synthetic cytidine analogues to generate pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Therefore, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 57/130 
 
 
 
oral administration of decitabine at relatively lower dose levels is unable to provide pharmacologically 
relevant systemic exposure levels. 
Cedazuridine is a new chemical entity (NCE) and a potent CDA inhibitor. Oral administration of 
cedazuridine with decitabine increases the systemic exposure of decitabine via inhibition of first pass 
metabolism of decitabine in the gut and liver by CDA, thereby enabling the pharmacologic effect of 
decitabine. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Global DNA demethylation is understood as a marker of the primary pharmacodynamic activity of 
decitabine. In the ASTX727 studies, this was determined by detection of the percent change from 
baseline of long interspersed nucleotide elements-1 (LINE-1) demethylation in blood.  
Pharmacodynamic data from the 42 subjects in the Dose Escalation Part of Study ASTX727 01 with 
available LINE-1 methylation measurements for Cycle 1showed that .  
LINE-1 demethylation increased with escalating doses of cedazuridine from 40 to 100 mg and then 
with escalating doses of decitabine from 20 to 40 mg. Maximal demethylation of approximately 12% is 
consistent with that expected for a cycle of IV decitabine 20 mg/m2. Cycle 2 reductions were similar 
but attenuated, as Cycle 2 baseline LINE-1 methylation was lower than the Cycle 1 baseline as a result 
of incomplete recovery of methylation at the end of Cycle 1. 
A PK/PD analysis of the relationship between maximum LINE-1 demethylation and 5-Day decitabine 
AUC found that there appeared to be a saturable positive PK/PD relationship, with little further increase 
in response with higher exposures (Figure 9).

Figure 9. Relationship Between Maximum LINE-1 Demethylation and 5-Day Decitabine AUC by 
Treatment (Studies ASTX727-01 and ASTX727-02 NA MDS/CMML) 
Similarly, the relationship between LINE-1 demethylation AUECD29 and decitabine 5-Day AUC was 
generally flat and appeared to be treatment-independent based on overlapping data points from the 
three treatments (Figure 10). 
This suggests that a maximal drug effect was achieved over the range of decitabine exposures in the 
Phase 2 parts of Study ASTX727-01 and in Study ASTX727-02 NA MDS/CMML.

Comparison of LINE-1 Demethylation Between ASTX727 and IV Decitabine 
In the pivotal Study ASTX727-02 EU in AML patients and in the supportive study ASTX727-02 NA in 
MDS/CMML patients, subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a treatment sequence for the 
first 2 cycles (Sequence A: ASTX727 in Cycle 1 and IV decitabine Cycle 2 or Sequence B: IV decitabine 
in Cycle 1 and ASTX727 in Cycle 2).  
In these studies, the final, recommended doses of ASTX727 and IV decitabine, respectively, were 
administered.  
Pharmacodynamic variables were based on assessments of %LINE-1 demethylation in blood.  
Due to the crossover design of the study and carryover effects of demethylation from Cycle 1 to Cycle 
2, the LINE-1 methylation results were presented by treatment (ASTX727 and IV decitabine) in each 
cycle separately.  
Results: Study ASTX727-02 EU (AML) 
In the treatment comparisons in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, maximum %LINE-1 demethylation between 
decitabine IV and ASTX727 was numerically not different, with a 95% CI that included 0, consistent 
with both treatments producing similar pharmacodynamic effects (Table 23).

Cytidine Plasma Concentrations 
An exploratory objective of the Phase 1 Study ASTX727-01 included the assessment of change from 
baseline in plasma cytidine levels after treatment.  
Plasma cytidine levels were evaluated after dosing with oral decitabine alone, IV decitabine, and oral 
ASTX727 (as decitabine and cedazuridine). The change in circulating plasma cytidine from baseline 
was calculated. 
As expected, administration of decitabine alone (Day −3 [oral] or Day 1 [IV]) did not appear to affect 
plasma cytidine levels, as decitabine is not known to inhibit CDA. In contrast, on days when 
cedazuridine was administered at dose levels of 40, 60, or 100 mg, a consistent change manifested as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 61/130 
 
 
 
 
 
an increase in plasma cytidine levels. This appeared to be modest (approximately 2-fold) and 
transient, as evidenced by the trend of recovery towards baseline and full recovery as seen at predose 
on Cycle 2 Day −3. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Efficacy and safety of decitabine/cedazuridine FDC were to be established based on a PK bridge to 
previous data for decitabine when administered IV. The Phase 2 and 3 studies (AML and MDS/CMML 
patients) were not designed to enable a proper assessment of exposure-response. A concentration-QTc 
analysis of data from the thorough QTc study in healthy volunteers was also conducted (see Section 
3.3.7.6. ). 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
2.6.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The most important role of pharmacokinetics in this application is bridging from Inaqovi (ASTX727) to 
previous efficacy and safety data for IV decitabine based on equivalent decitabine exposure (total AUC 
over the 5-day cycle). This approach is acceptable, and the PK bridge has been adequately established 
as further discussed below. 
The therapeutic window has not been discussed by the Applicant. For decitabine the aim is to obtain 
similar exposure as with the approved IV dose and thus similar efficacy and safety. It is noted that the 
food effect (40% decrease in decitabine AUC with a high-fat meal compared to fasted state) is 
assumed to be considered clinically relevant hence the product is recommended to be taken in the 
fasted state (as in the pivotal study comparing oral to IV treatment). Increased cedazuridine exposure 
might lead to both safety issues for cedazuridine as such (although available data do not indicate a 
large potential for side effects) and potentially safety issues due to increased decitabine exposure, 
while decreased cedazuridine exposure would lead to decreased decitabine exposure and thus risk of 
decreased efficacy. However, no dosage adjustments are currently proposed due to interactions or in 
special populations, and thus it is considered less critical to define the therapeutic window. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical methods used were adequately validated.  
Population PK 
The popPK analysis is mainly used to support claims regarding the impact of different covariates on 
decitabine and cedazuridine exposures. The final semi-mechanistic population PK models (IV 
decitabine, oral decitabine and oral cedazuridine) were combined to describe the PK of decitabine and 
cedazuridine given alone and in combination, and for the IV and oral formulation of decitabine. The 
final model parameters were estimated including information from both the AML and MDS population. 
The high number of BQL samples were handled using the M6 method, which in this application was 
considered sufficient. The selection of covariates for inclusion in the models is not agreed as many 
were correlated precluding the possibility to investigate the impact of weight on oral exposure of 
decitabine. Simulations with a model that includes correlated covariates, where only one covariate is 
altered, without keeping the correlation to the other covariates intact, can be biased. Due to the 
limitations of the current models, they are not considered suitable for description of special 
populations, and conclusions on specific matters related to parameters should be made with caution.

EMA/CHMP/402324/2023

Absorption 
The phase III data presented on PK parameters in the SmPC and the clinical pharmacology summary 
are generated in the MDS/CMML population and not AML. Since the pharmacokinetics of ASTX727 is 
not depending on diagnosis, this is acceptable. In addition, the MDS/CMML study had a higher number 
of subjects included compared to the AML study (138 subjects vs. 89 subjects). 
Based on available data (including mean fraction absorbed reported as 47.5% for cedazuridine in study 
ASTX727-01), cedazuridine does not appear to have complete absorption while decitabine possibly is 
completely absorbed (considering the increase in exposure when first-pass effect is reduced by 
cedazuridine). However, as the applicant makes no claim regarding BCS class, no firm conclusion will 
be drawn. 
Since the oral bioavailability of decitabine (dose-normalised AUC-ratio compared to IV treatment) was 
larger than 100% when given with cedazuridine, this indicates that co-administration of cedazuridine 
does not only affect the first-pass metabolism but also the elimination of decitabine. For example, in 
ASTX72-01-B (dose confirmation stage) the mean decitabine t1/2 following concomitant oral 
administration of decitabine and cedazuridine was slightly higher compared with IV (1.08 h), with t1/2 
values of 1.14 h, 1.30 and 1.40 h on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 5, respectively. The slightly longer half-life 
of decitabine indicated that the elimination may be slower in combination with cedazuridine, although 
the most prominent effect on bioavailability is due to decreased first pass metabolism. The trend with 
slightly longer half-life at day 2 and 5 for oral administration was also seen in the phase III studies. 
It is not entirely clear if increased cedazuridine concentrations (e.g. in special populations or due to 
interactions) would lead to additional increases in decitabine exposure, as higher cedazuridine doses 
than the clinical dose of 100 mg has not been studied. Large additional effects on first-pass 
metabolism are not expected considering the results above. 
The CHMP considered in the previous advice that study ASTX727-02 with AUC equivalence to 
decitabine IV as the primary endpoint and clinical efficacy/safety and biological activity as secondary 
endpoints, should provide sufficient information to support bridging to the clinical data that supported 
the approval of IV-decitabine. Bioequivalence for 5-Day AUC0-24 between oral and IV decitabine could 
be concluded for both the AML (EU) and the MDS/CMML (NA) population as well as for pooled data 
from the two studies. From a PK-perspective, taking in account that this was a cross-over study 
design, the type of haematological malignance when comparing IV to oral exposure is not crucial. 
However, for supportive efficacy and safety comparisons it was previously concluded that comparisons 
in AML patients were needed and the Applicant therefore presents the data from the AML population as 
pivotal and the data from the MDS/CMML population as supportive. The exposure in both populations 
was found to be similar. 
As expected, there are differences in the decitabine plasma concentration curves between IV and oral 
administration. For example, differences in extent of exposure (AUC) between oral and IV 
administration is seen on day 1 which is likely due to less cedazuridine present systemically. This 
difference is not seen on subsequent days when steady state is expected for cedazuridine. Cmax is also 
consistently lower for ASTX727 compared to IV decitabine; on Day 1 the difference was 54% (AML) 
and 55% (MDS/CMML) and on Day 5 28% (AML) and 22%(MDS/CMML).  
In order to support that the lower Cmax (and lower AUC on day 1) was not clinically relevant, the 
applicant has submitted supportive PD data. The PD endpoint, i.e., the maximum percent LINE-1 
demethylation, was not significantly different between ASTX727 and IV decitabine in the Phase 3 Study 
ASTX727-02 in AML or in MDS/CMML patients. This supports that differences in PK profile between 
ASTX727 and IV decitabine are not expected to affect the primary pharmacodynamic effect.

Based on the results of the food effect study (40% decrease in decitabine AUC with a high-fat meal), it 
is considered acceptable to recommend intake in the fasted state (no food intake 2 hours before or 
after administration of Inaqovi) as this was in line with the recommendation in the pivotal study, 
although this recommendation is not very convenient for the patients. The applicant has made a 
commitment to submit the results of the additional food effect study (ASTX727-06 food effect 
substudy) when available and to update the product information as applicable.  
Distribution 
The concentration range used in the plasma protein binding study was adequate for decitabine, but for 
cedazuridine the concentrations used were higher than the clinical concentrations. Although it would 
have been better to investigate a lower concentration range, it is not considered likely that this would 
affect the conclusion that cedazuridine has low plasma protein binding. Protein-binding of cedazuridine 
was also investigated in an additional in vitro-experiment, together with cedazuridine-epimer, where 
the protein binding was found to be even lower (0%). The applicant has not discussed the discrepancy 
in results, but has kept the previous protein binding value in the SmPC. In both studies, it is however 
obvious that the protein binding is low and this can be accepted. 
Elimination 
For decitabine, the major route of elimination is metabolism (followed by renal excretion of 
metabolites). 
För cedazuridine, the two major routes of elimination are renal excretion of unchanged drug and 
conversion to epimer (followed by renal excretion). The elimination pathways of cedazuridine are 
considered sufficiently well characterised. Available data (human mass balance study demonstrating 
that more cedazuridine epimer is formed following oral than IV administration together with quality 
data) indicate that the conversion from cedazuridine to its epimer mainly occurs due to physiochemical 
degradation at low pH rather than by enzyme involvement.  
After a single dose of 100 mg non-labelled cedazuridine, the total amount of cedazuridine and 
cedazuridine-epimer extracted in urine was 17.1 mg (17.1 %) and 17.5 mg (17.5 %) respectively of 
the total dose. Following a radiolabelled oral dose of cedazuridine, on average 45.7 % and 51.2% was 
recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. In urine, 20.7% of the total radiolabelled dose was 
extracted as cedazuridine and 13.8% as cedazuridine-epimer. The amount of renally unchanged 
cedazuridine reported in the SmPC (17.1%) refers to data with unlabelled substance, this can be 
accepted. Results based on labelled and unlabelled substance is similar. In faeces, the recovery of the 
method was reported to be low but at least 14.8 % of the total doses was excreted unchanged and at 
least 11.6% as cedazuridine-epimer. In total, 61% of the totally administered dose has been identified 
(as cedazuridine and cedazuridine-epimer), corresponding to 63% of the extracted dose. This is less 
than the 80% recommended in the Guideline on interactions, but no concern is raised, considering that 
over 20% of the dose was in non-extractable material in faeces. 
The renal clearance (CLr) of cedazuridine was 4.46 L/h (ranging between 3.01 and 5.47 L/h) and 
filtration (fu*GFR) is expected to be around 4.68 L/h, thus active renal secretion does not seem to be 
included in the renal elimination of cedazuridine.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
The accumulation ratios for decitabine and cedazuridine at steady state were typically 1.8 times and 
1.1 times the Day 1 plasma concentrations, respectively, suggesting a slight accumulation. Time 
dependency was not discussed by the Applicant. However, based on the conclusion that neither 
decitabine nor cedazuridine is metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes, autoinduction is not

Page 64/130 
 
 
 
expected, and there is thus no clear mechanism for a time dependency. It can be concluded that there 
is little or no time dependency for Inaqovi. 
Special populations 
Due to the limitations of the current pop-PK model, it is not considered suitable for description of 
special populations, and conclusions on specific matters related to parameters should be made with 
caution.  
The graphical analysis of observed data indicates that there is a trend that cedazuridine exposure 
slightly increases with decreasing CrCL, as expected for a substance for which renal elimination as 
unchanged drug is a major elimination pathway. However, the graphical analysis is biased as weight 
and CrCL is correlated and thus it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions. There is also a trend of 
slight increase in decitabine exposure with decreasing CrCL, in particular for oral treatment. The effect 
on oral decitabine exposure is likely mainly due to the increase in cedazuridine exposure (due to 
inhibition of decitabine metabolism caused by increased cedazuridine exposure) as renal excretion of 
unchanged decitabine is low. Patients with mild renal impairment constituted a significant part of the 
population on which the overall safety assessment is based and safety data in this population did not 
warrant any specific recommendations. As it was difficult to draw conclusions regarding possible 
increase of haematological adverse events in patients with moderate RI, it is agreed to recommend 
additional monitoring of these patients. There is an ongoing study investigating the PK, safety, and 
tolerability of oral decitabine and cedazuridine in cancer patients with severe renal impairment 
compared to patients with normal renal function. The Applicant has made a commitment to submit the 
results of study ASTX727-17 (RI study) when available. While awaiting these data, it is considered 
adequate to recommend caution in patients with severe RI.  
Based on the mass balance study, renal impairment can be expected to increase the exposure of 
cedazuridine (as renal elimination of parent drug is major elimination pathway) and potentially also the 
exposure of decitabine subsequently to increased cedazuridine exposure. However, decitabine itself is 
mainly metabolised and not excreted renally as unchanged drug. 
It is difficult to draw any pharmacokinetic conclusions regarding hepatic impairment based on data 
obtained with Inaqovi as so few patients in the studies had liver impairment. Large effects of hepatic 
impairment on decitabine or cedazuridine exposure are not expected but as decitabine affects markers 
of liver function this may warrant additional caution in these patients. There is an ongoing study 
investigating the PK, safety, and tolerability of oral decitabine and cedazuridine in cancer patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The Applicant has made a commitment to submit the results 
of study ASTX727-18 (HI study) when available. Based on available safety data, no dose adjustment or 
special handling is needed in patients defined by the applicant as having mild hepatic impairment. It is 
however noted that the Applicant has defined liver function based only on total bilirubin, which is not in 
accordance with the NCI classification system (which uses total bilirubin and aspartate 
aminotransferase). Thus, it is not clear that the subjects identified as having “mild HI” can really be 
considered to have this degree of hepatic impairment. A general recommendation on caution in 
patients with all degrees of hepatic impairment is adequate.  
Large effects of hepatic impairment on decitabine or cedazuridine exposure are not expected as 
cedazuridine is not hepatically metabolised and as decitabine is metabolised by cytidine deaminase 
present in several tissues (liver, kidney, intestinal epithelium and blood). 
Based on graphical comparison of observed data there is a trend of increased exposure of oral 
decitabine in women compared to men. As no such trend is observed for IV decitabine (for which the 
dose is adjusted based on BSA), the trend observed for oral decitabine is likely due to differences in 
weight rather than due to sex. It is agreed that sex did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 65/130 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics of decitabine or cedazuridine after dosing with Inaqovi and that no dose adjustment 
is required. 
Inaqovi is given as a flat dose (35 mg decitabine) while IV-decitabine is given as a body-surface 
adjusted dose (20 mg/m2 body surface area). There is a trend of decreased decitabine 5-day AUC0-24 
with increasing weight or BSA with oral decitabine treatment, but this is not considered to be clinically 
relevant. 
The trend of increased cedazuridine exposure with increasing age may be caused by decreased renal 
function. The trend of increased decitabine exposure with increasing age, in particular for oral 
treatment, could be subsequent to the increase in cedazuridine exposure.  
The safety and efficacy of Inaqovi in the paediatric population (aged less than 18 years) have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Interactions 
The main potential for interactions with cedazuridine is due to its inhibition of CDA. It is agreed that 
concomitant use with drugs metabolised by CDA should be avoided, as proposed by the Applicant.  
Regarding cedazuridine as perpetrator of drug interactions except for CDA inhibition, available in vitro 
data do not indicate relevant interactions via CYP enzymes (direct or time dependent inhibition or 
induction) or transporters (inhibition). 
There is one major metabolite, cedazuridine-epimer, that has been investigated for potential to inhibit 
CYP enzymes. It can be concluded that cedazuridine-epimer does not cause clinically relevant CYP 
inhibition.   
Regarding effects of PPI, the Applicant proposes that increased stomach pH might lead to a lower 
degree of conversion of cedazuridine to its less active epimer and thus an increased effect, possibly 
leading to increased decitabine exposure. There appears to be some effect on cedazuridine exposure 
when combined with PPI, however, it does not appear to have a subsequent impact on decitabine 
exposure. The slightly higher exposure of cedazuridine is not expected to have clinically significant 
impact.  
Cedazuridine is not subject to hepatic metabolism including metabolism by CYP enzymes and is also 
not a substrate of the most relevant transporter enzymes (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 or MATE2-K). Thus, the potential for cedazuridine as victim of drug-drug 
interactions is considered low. Cedazuridine was however observed to be a substrate of the 
transporters CNT1, CNT3, and ENT2. As it is not mandatory to study if new medicinal products are 
substrates (or inhibitors) of these transporters, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. The 
Applicant does not propose to include this information in the SmPC, which is agreed.  
For decitabine, the potential for systemic inhibition/induction will be similar as for IV-decitabine as the 
exposure is similar (equivalent AUC, lower Cmax). However, as decitabine is now administered orally 
instead of intravenously, there is also a risk of intestinal interactions. The Applicant submitted 
additional in vitro data investigating the inhibitory effect of decitabine of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP at 
sufficiently high concentrations in order to exclude intestinal inhibition (i.e. 60 µM), considering that 
decitabine is now given orally instead of intravenously, and there was no signal of in vivo relevant 
inhibition of P-gp, BCRP or CYP3A4.

2.6.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
A  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  analysis  was  performed  in  order  to  quantify  the  relationship 
between  decitabine  exposures  (5  –day  total  cycle  AUC)  and  LINE-1  demethylation  (maximum  LINE-1 
demethylation  and  AUEC  for  LINE-1  demethylation)  in  subjects  with  MDS  and  CMML.  The  analysis 
included 79 subjects from ASTX727-01 study (Dose Confirmation and FDC parts) and 133 from ASTX727-
02 study. 
Maximum LINE-1 demethylation and decitabine exposure showed a positive relationship up to a value 
of 1000 ng*h/ml, where the system appeared to be saturated and there is no further increase in 
demethylation with increasing exposure.   
Accordingly, over the range of individual AUCs achieved at the recommended dose of 20 mg/m2 IV 
decitabine or 35 mg/100 mg oral decitabine/cedazuridine, there was no relationship between individual 
exposure and PD effect at the recommended dose. The Applicant suggests that this may imply that at 
the recommended clinical dose of decitabine, a plateau has been reached in terms of the 
pharmacodynamic effect.  
Importantly, a similar degree of %LINE-1 demethylation over a 5-day cycle was shown after 
administration of the final recommended dose of ASTX727 and after administration of 20 mg/m2 
IV decitabine. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
This application is based on a PK bridge,  to demonstrate that the known efficacy and safety data for IV 
decitabine can be extrapolated to ASTX727. Bioequivalence for 5-Day AUC0-24 between oral and IV 
decitabine was shown for both the AML (EU) and the MDS/CMML (NA) population as well as for pooled 
data from the two studies. AUC0-24 for day 1 is lower for oral compared to IV treatment and Cmax is 
also lower following oral treatment. 
The PD endpoint, i.e., the maximum percent LINE-1 demethylation, was numerically not different, 
given similar AUC for decitabine, between ASTX727 and IV decitabine in the Phase 3 Study 
ASTX727-02 in AML or in MDS/CMML patients. 
This supports that differences in the PK profile (e.g. Cmax) between ASTX727 and IV decitabine are 
not expected to affect the primary pharmacodynamic effect. 
The efficacy of ASTX727 at the proposed dose (35 mg decitabine in combination with 100 mg 
cedazuridine per day for 5 consecutive treatment days per 28-day cycle) can thus be concluded to be 
similar to that of IV decitabine at the approved dose (20 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days per 28-
day cycle), in the treatment of adult patients with AML.  
Inaqovi is considered approvable from a clinical pharmacology point of view. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address post authorisation the issues related 
to pharmacology: The Applicant has made a commitment to submit the results of study ASTX727-17 
(RI study), study ASTX727-18 (HI study) and study ASTX727-06 (food effect substudy) when 
available. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The primary data supporting efficacy for the AML indication are from the phase 3 study: ASTX727-02 
EU.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 67/130 
 
 
 
During the drug development the efficacy of ASTX727 was initially evaluated in subjects with MDS or 
CMML in a Phase 1-2 study (ASTX727 01) and in a Phase 3 study (ASTX727-02 NA) which are now 
considered supportive for the application. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study ASTX727-01 included MDS and CMML subjects who received prior HMA treatment.  
In Phase 1 (Dose Escalation Stage; ASTX727-01-A), various doses of cedazuridine and decitabine were 
given as separate capsules for dose titration. Systemic exposures after oral decitabine alone or with 
cedazuridine were compared in the same subjects with IV decitabine (20 mg/m2) to determine the 
doses of both drugs that closely emulated the IV decitabine exposure. See clinical pharmacology 
section of the report. 
Results from Phase 1 of study ASTX727-01 showed that 100 mg cedazuridine with decitabine doses of 
30 mg and 40 mg achieved 5-day cumulative AUC0-t of 81% and 128%, respectively, of that of IV 
decitabine. In Phase 2 (ASTX727-01-B), the combination of decitabine and cedazuridine at the final 
recommended doses of 35 mg and 100 mg, respectively, was investigated. See clinical pharmacology 
section of the report. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
Study ASTX727-02 EU 
This was a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study of 
ASTX727 versus IV decitabine (study design is depicted in Figure 11). Adult subjects with AML with de 
novo or secondary AML as defined by World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria, who were not 
candidates for standard induction chemotherapy and who were candidates to receive IV decitabine 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive the ASTX727 FDC tablet Daily×5 in Cycle 1, followed by IV 
decitabine 20 mg/m2 Daily×5 in Cycle 2 (Sequence A), or the converse order (Sequence B).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Clinical response was adjudicated by Astex medical monitors based on programmed data listings 
according to the Astex AML Response Assessment Criteria. The evaluation of response was based on 
Modified IWG 2003 AML Response Criteria (Cheson et al 2003) and included CRp according to 
Kantarjian et al 2012. Subjects who did not have a valid post-treatment efficacy assessment (ie, no 
post-treatment bone marrow [BM])/peripheral blood [PB] sample or the quality of BM/PB sample was 
not adequate for an assessment of efficacy) were classified as not evaluable (NE) for response 
classifications. Subjects who could not be classified into a response category (CR, CRi, CRp, or partial 
response [PR]) or into the NE category were classified as non-responders (NR). Progressive disease 
and stable disease were based on criteria from the European LeukemiaNet (Döhner et al 2017), and 
CRh was defined as per Kantarjian et al 2017. 
Sample size 
The primary study objective was to establish decitabine AUC equivalence of 5-day dosing between 
ASTX727 and IV decitabine. 
In an equivalence test of mean using two one-sided tests on data from a two-by-two crossover design, 
a total sample size of ~70 evaluable subjects achieve 90% power at a 5% significance level assuming 
a true ratio of the means of 1.0 and a coefficient of variation on the original, unlogged scale of 0.41, 
and given the equivalence limits of the mean ratio are 0.80 and 1.25.  
Accounting for that approximately 20% of subjects may not be evaluable, approximately 85 subjects 
were to be randomised. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 72/130 
 
 
 
 
The estimated intra-subject CV from the analysis of 5-day AUC in study ASTX727-02 with MDS and 
CMML subjects was approximately 0.32. A conservative intra-subject CV value of 0.41 was used for 
AML sample size justification. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to Cycle 1 study treatment in a 
ratio of 1:1 to receive ASTX727 or IV decitabine. Subjects crossed over to the other therapy in Cycle 2. 
Treatment assignment was determined through a computer-generated randomisation schedule and 
accessed through an interactive voice response system.  
Statistical methods 
The submitted statistical analysis plan (SAP version 2.0 dated 15 October 2021) was based on the 
ASTX727-02 protocol amendment 2.6 Europe (dated 27 January 2021) and describes analysis of AML 
subjects included in the ASTX727-02 study (ASTX727-02 SAP [AML]). 
The analysis for submission purpose was planned to be performed after all subjects had completed 6 
months of follow-up or permanently discontinued treatment prior to 6 months of follow up from their 
first treatment dose. This analysis was to include all available data up to the data cut-off.  
An additional analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed the study.  
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests and confidence intervals (CIs) as described in the SAP 
were to be two-sided with alpha = 0.05.  
Analysis sets 
Primary endpoint PK analysis set according to the SAP: was to include decitabine daily AUC0-t from 
subjects who were successfully dosed in Cycles 1 and 2 and who met the following criteria for both 
ASTX727 and IV decitabine dosing.  
ASTX727 successful dosing: received full dose of ASTX727 within 3 hours of the intended dosing time, 
and no vomiting within 6 hours of dosing.  
Decitabine successful dosing: 
• Subjects in this analysis set were to have at least 2 days of evaluable decitabine AUC0-t 
measurements in the ASTX727 cycle, i.e., Day 1 and either Day 2 or Day 5:  
o For Day 1 to be included, subjects must have been successfully dosed on Day 1.  
o For Day 2 to be included: subjects must have been successfully dosed on Day 1 and Day 2.  
o For Day 5 to be included: subjects must have been successfully dosed on Day 4 and Day 5. IV 
decitabine successful dosing: received the full dose as a 1-hour infusion.  
• Subjects in this analysis set were to have at least 1 evaluable day of decitabine AUC0-t measurement 
in the IV decitabine cycle, either Day 1 or Day 5.  
Efficacy Analysis Set: was to include data from all subjects who received any amount of study 
treatment. All data were to be included, and no subjects excluded due to protocol deviations. Subjects 
were to be included in the treatment sequence according to randomisation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 73/130 
 
 
 
Safety Analysis Set: was to include data from all subjects who received any amount of study 
treatment. In the safety analysis, no data exclusion will be allowed because of protocol deviations. 
Subjects were to be included in the treatment sequence according to the treatment sequence received. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) LINE-1 Analysis Set: was to include data from all subjects who received any 
amount of study treatment and had LINE-1 methylation data at baseline (Day 1) of Cycle 1 or 2 and on 
either Day 8 or Day 15 of the respective cycle. 
Primary analysis of the primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint analysis included data from the following PK assessment days to calculate the 5-
day total cycle AUC:  
• ASTX727 AUC0-24: Days 1, 2, and/or 5.  
• IV decitabine AUC0-24: Days 1 and/or 5. 
Efficacy analyses 
Efficacy analyses were to be summarised by treatment sequence and all subjects combined (Total), 
unless otherwise specified. Efficacy variables were to be summarised using descriptive statistics and 
there were no formal comparison analyses between treatment sequences. 
Response Rate  
Subjects who did not have a valid post-treatment efficacy assessment (i.e., no post-treatment BM/PB 
sample or the quality of BM/PB sample was not adequate for an assessment of efficacy) were to be 
classified as not evaluable (NE) for response classifications. Subjects who could not be classified into a 
response category (CR, CRi, or PR) or into the NE category were to be classified as non-responders 
(NR). 
Analyses of LINE-1 methylation 
Based on that LINE-1 methylation levels often do not completely return to baseline by Day 28 of Cycle 
1, and to avoid the confounding effects of differing baselines in Cycle 2 vs Cycle 1, subjects were 
compared for each of the 2 cycles separately using the baseline values prior to each cycle, thus limiting 
the evaluation to interpatient comparisons in each of the 2 cycles. 
For each of cycles 1 and 2, LINE-1 methylation data were summarised descriptively by visit and 
treatment. In addition, 95% CIs for mean maximum %LINE-1 demethylation in Cycles 1 and 2 were 
provided for ASTX727 and IV decitabine, respectively. The 95% CI for the difference in mean 
maximum %LINE-1 demethylation between ASTX727 and IV decitabine in Cycles 1 and 2 were also 
estimated based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as factor. 
Safety analyses 
Adverse events (AEs) has been summarised by actual treatment received at the onset of the AE.  
Laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, and ECOG performance status has been summarised by treatment 
sequence and all subjects combined (Total), unless otherwise specified. 
Interim analyses 
No formal interim analysis was performed in this study to stop the study for futility or lack of efficacy.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Study ASTX727 02 originally included only subjects with MDS or CMML from North America (NA; US 
and Canada). Protocol amendment v1.3 (10 December 2018) expanded the subject population to 
include approximately 70 evaluable subjects with AML in Europe and Canada to extend the PK bridging 
approach to the AML population as recommended by the CHMP (Scientific Advice 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/485806/2018), the indication for which IV decitabine (Dacogen) is approved in the 
European Union (EU). 
Subsequent protocol amendments were produced to address specific national health agency 
requirements.  
Changes to the planned analyses 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will only describe analysis of AML subjects included in the ASTX727-
02 study (ASTX727-02 SAP [AML]). There is a separate SAP which has been approved earlier for 
analysis of only MDS/CMML subjects included in the ASTX727-02 study (ASTX727-02 SAP).  
Response assessment is described in detail in Appendix 1 of the final version of the SAP dated 15 
October 2021. The following changes were implemented:  
•  Response categories were CR, CRi, CRp, PR, NE, and NR. In addition, CR with partial 
hematologic recovery (CRh) was expected to be reported.  
• 
• 
• 
The reference for CRp (Kantarjian et al 2012) was added. “Complete response with partial 
hematologic recovery (CRh) will also be assessed as a subset of CRi or CRp” was removed.  
The criteria for CRi were changed to be consistent with IWG 2003 AML Response Criteria 
(Cheson et al 2003) instead of the protocol.  
Progressive disease and stable disease were added based on the European LeukemiaNet 
(Döhner et al 2017).  
•  Changed CRp, CRi to CRi (or CRp) due to CRp being the subset of CRi.  
•  Duration of CR or CRp was added based on the DACO-016 study (Kantarjian et al 2012)  
•  Subjects who could not be classified into a response category (CR, CRi/CRp, or PR) or into the 
NE category were expected to be classified as non-responders (NR). This definition was 
modified, so that NR was defined as the absence of CR, CRi CRp, CRh, PR (when stable disease 
and progressive disease were not assessed). 
Protocol deviations 
Twelve (13.5%) of the 89 randomised subjects had at least 1 important protocol deviation; of these 
subjects, 7 subjects (7.9%) had deviations related to study drug administration, and 2 subjects (2.2%) 
Assessment report

had deviations related to study procedures. All other categories of important protocol deviations 
included only 1 subject each (eligibility criteria, randomisation/enrolment, and COVID-19).

Table 39. Retrospective Comparison of Efficacy Parameters of ASTX727 vs Decitabine for Subjects with 
AML  
2.6.5.5.  Supportive study(ies) 
The efficacy of ASTX727 was initially evaluated in subjects with MDS or CMML in a Phase 1-2 study 
(ASTX727 01) and in a Phase 3 study (ASTX727-02 NA). The efficacy results from the Phase 2 stages 
of ASTX727-01 (ie, ASTX727-01-B), and efficacy results from Phase 3 Study ASTX727-02 NA are 
supportive for this submission. 
Study ASTX727-01-B Phase 2 was designed to evaluate the dose combination of 35 mg decitabine and 
100 mg cedazuridine in a crossover design to confirm that the dose combination yielded PK exposures 
and DNA demethylation similar to IV decitabine. CR was observed in 17.5% of all treated subjects. 
Median duration of response for subjects with a best response of CR was 285 days (interquartile range: 
155, 413 days). Of subjects who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 50% were RBC 
transfusion free for any consecutive 56-day period post baseline. Similarly, of the subjects who were 
platelet transfusion dependent at baseline, 50% were platelet transfusion free for any consecutive 56 
day period post-baseline. Median time to AML or death was 364 days (95% CI: 305.0, 654.0), and 
median survival time was 589 days (95% CI: 392.0, 864.0). 
Study ASTX727-02 NA was a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, open-label, 2-period, 2 sequence 
crossover study comparing decitabine AUC equivalence of ASTX727 and IV decitabine in subjects with 
MDS and CMML. The study design was identical to that of ASTX727 02 EU in that subjects were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a treatment sequence for the first two cycles (Sequence A: 
ASTX727 in Cycle 1 and IV decitabine Cycle 2; or Sequence B: IV decitabine in Cycle 1 and ASTX727 in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 89/130 
 
 
 
 
 
Cycle 2). After completion of the first 2 treatment cycles, subjects continued to receive treatment with 
ASTX727 in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, treatment discontinuation 
for other reasons, or they were withdrawn from the study. CR was observed in 21.8% of all treated 
subjects and in 24.8% of subjects evaluable for response. Median duration of best response was 371.0 
days (95% CI: 289.0, 439.0). More than half (51.9%) of the 54 subjects who were RBC transfusion 
dependent at baseline were RBC transfusion independent for any consecutive ≥56-day period post-
baseline. A similar overall rate of platelet transfusion independence (50%) for any consecutive ≥56-day 
period post-baseline was observed for subjects with platelet transfusion dependence at baseline. 
Median survival time was 966.0 days (95% CI: 809.0, NE), and median follow-up time was 966.0 days 
(range, 868 to 1208 days). 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy was intended to be demonstrated by a PK bridging approach to the clinical data for IV 
decitabine from pivotal study ASTX727-02 EU, a multicentre, open-label, 2-sequence crossover study 
of oral ASTX727 versus IV decitabine in patients with AML. This strategy was accepted during CHMP 
scientific advice meeting.  
Study population 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria allowed selection of a study population in line with the proposed 
target indication. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were in line with that of Dacogen clinical studies and its 
approved indications across regions.   
Endpoints  
The primary endpoint was total 5-day AUC exposure of decitabine after treatment with ASTX727 
versus IV decitabine.  
All secondary efficacy endpoint (like CR, time to first response, OS) were exploratory. Efficacy was 
explored based on complete response (CR) and rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to 
transfusion independence. Both parameters are considered adequate given the current clinical context. 
The response criteria for evaluation of AML - and assessment of the main efficacy endpoint- are based 
on the IWG criteria published by Cheson et al (2003), and are considered adequate.  
The median treatment duration was 5 months (range 0 to 18 months).   
Sample size 
The sample size estimation was based on the primary PK endpoint and appears appropriate.  
No sample size considerations were made regarding the assessment of efficacy or safety.  The 
ASTX727 efficacy and safety assessment is referred to cycle 1 or, for long-term follow-up of ASTX727 
treatment, beyond cycle 2 and is, from cycle 3 and onward hampered by the open label single arm 
design as well as that all subjects also were to receive IV decitabine (either in cycle 1 or cycle 2). 
Although the sample size is considered adequate in terms of statistical assumptions regarding the 
primary endpoint, the database is limited for generating evidence in terms of efficacy and safety in 
AML patients. However, efficacy was a secondary objective in the current study and the reported data 
are only provided as supportive, which is acceptable.

EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 90/130 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
According to study schedule of events, randomisation was to be performed during screening. As 
described, randomisation could have been performed at least up to 14 days before initiation of study 
treatment administration although the CSP also stated that subjects were to initiate study treatment as 
soon as possible after randomisation. In the end, a total of 89 subjects were randomised whereof 2.2% 
(2/89) never received any study treatment due to worsening disease (n=1) and that screening 
assessments could not be performed (n=1). 
Statistical analysis 
The statistical methods appear reasonable. Efficacy endpoints were summarised using descriptive 
statistics.  
However, all summaries of efficacy had been based on randomised and treated subjects (i.e., 87/89). 
In a single-arm trial, clinical response data should be presented based on the ITT population. Thus, the 
applicant was requested to present new estimates and corresponding 95% CI using the Randomised 
Subject Analysis Set. In response, new analyses have been provided for the endpoints proposed to be 
presented in the SmPC 5.1. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study population 
A total of 110 patients were screened, 21 were screen failures, 89 patients were randomised, and 
finally 87 patients were treated (AST727 only: 8; IV decitabine only: 7); 37 patients are continuing in 
study (on study treatment n=30; survival follow up n=7). All efficacy endpoints are summarised using 
the Efficacy Analysis Set (all treated subjects; N=87). 
Patients included (n=87) had a median age of 78 years (range 61-92) with 97% of subjects ≥65 years, 
and 61% were male. Poor and intermediate risk cytogenetics were noted in 38% and 52% of subjects, 
respectively. Fifty-two percent of subjects had severe or moderate renal failure, as would be 
anticipated given the age range studied. 
Primary endpoint 
ASTX727 demonstrated equivalent decitabine PK AUC to IV decitabine 20 mg/m2 when both were 
administered over 5 days. For further assessment of PK endpoints, please refer to the PK AR. 
Secondary endpoints 
The PD endpoint, i.e., the maximum percent LINE-1 demethylation, was numerically comparable 
between ASTX727 and IV decitabine in the Phase 3 Study ASTX727-02 in AML as well as MDS/CMML 
patients. This supports that differences in Cmax are not anticipated to result in different efficacy. 
After a median follow-up of 7.95 months, the CR rate in patients receiving ASTX727 was 21.8% (95% 
CI 13.7, 32.0), the median duration of CR was 5.8 months (95% CI 3.3, NE) and the median time to 
first response was 2.87 months (min, max: 1.8, 6.4). Of the 41 patients dependent on transfusions at 
baseline, 34.1% of patients became independent of transfusions post-baseline. Among 46 patients who 
were independent of transfusions at baseline, 26.1% of patients remained so post-baseline. 
Median duration of treatment (to the data cut-off date of 10 September 2021) was 4.86 months (range 
0 to 18 months), with 37.5% of subjects treated for >6 months and 6.3% of subjects treated for >12 
months. 
Median EFS time was 5.8 months (95% CI: 3.8, 8.3), median PFS time was 6.1 months (95% CI: 4.0, 
8.5) and median OS time was 7.9 months (95% CI: 5.9, 13.0). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 91/130 
 
 
 
None of the clinical endpoint directly isolate the effect of the test agents, as both test and reference 
agent were given before the assessment of ORR, and as a single arm trial does not isolate treatment 
effects on PFS or OS. 
Analysis performed across trials 
A retrospective comparison of results in subjects with AML being treated in study ASTX727-02 EU and 
subjects with AML treated with single-agent IV decitabine in the Phase 3 pivotal decitabine AML 
registration study (Study DACO-016) and the open-label, Phase 2 supportive decitabine study (Study 
DACO-017) was presented by the Applicant:  
CR rate of 21.8% with ASTX727 compared to 15.7% in study DACO-016 and 23.6% in study DACO-
017. Median survival of 7.9 months compared to 7.7 months in DACO-016 and 7.6 months in DACO-
017. Thus, the efficacy results achieved with ASTX727 were similar to the efficacy results of IV 
decitabine.  
Supportive studies  
The efficacy results from the Phase 2 stages of ASTX727-01 (ie, ASTX727-01-B), and from Phase 3 
Study ASTX727-02 NA showed clinical efficacy in MDS and CMML. The results from these studies 
support the present application. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Since AUC is similar for oral decitabine in combination with cedazuridine and for decitabine given IV at 
the respective recommended doses, it can be inferred that the efficacy of ASTX727 at the proposed 
dose is similar to that of IV decitabine at the approved dose, in the treatment of adult patients with 
AML. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Studies supporting the safety evaluation 
In support of the safety evaluation of ASTX727 the Applicant discussed primarily the results of three 
studies, in which decitabine + cedazuridine were administered according to the currently proposed 
dosing schedule (i.e., 35 mg decitabine/100 mg cedazuridine for 5 consecutive days of each 28-day 
cycle): 
• 
• 
• 
Study ASTX727-02 EU: Pivotal Phase 3 study in adult patients with AML (n=87, 80 of whom 
received ASTX727) 
Study ASTX727-02 North America (NA): Supportive data, Phase 3 study in adult patients with 
MDS/CMML (N=133) 
Study ASTX727-01-B (dose confirmation phase): Supportive data from the extension phase, 
adult patients with in MDS/CMML (n=80) 
The data presented from these studies are those up to the data cutoff dates that were used for the 
primary analyses for the individual clinical study reports (CSRs):

•  07 June 2021 for ASTX727-02 NA (supportive) 
•  16 September 2020 for ASTX727-01-B (supportive) 
In these three studies, oral decitabine + cedazuridine and IV decitabine were administered in Cycle 1 
and 2 in a crossover fashion. Thus, all patients in these studies received one cycle of IV decitabine.   
In addition, data are available from a completed thorough QT study of cedazuridine in adult healthy 
subjects.  
Extent of exposure  
A total of 502 subjects have received ASTX727 and/or IV decitabine in the ASTX727 clinical 
programme, and 40 subjects have received cedazuridine only.  
The pooled population from the studies mentioned above is referred to as the “integrated population”. 
The integrated population, thus, includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment 
(35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine) administered orally in the pivotal Phase 3 study 
ASTX727-02 or in the Phase 2 stage of study ASTX727-01, regardless of the formulation used 
(separate capsules or FDC tablets).  
Overall study drug exposure for the integrated population is summarised in Table 40.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any new AE or any worsening of an existing 
condition with an onset date on or after the first study drug administration date (Cycle 1 Day 1 
[C1D1]) and up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the start of an alternative anti-
cancer treatment (for MDS/CMML or AML), whichever occurred first.  
Events that occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the start of an 
alternative anti-cancer treatment (for MDS/CMML or AML) were also considered treatment-emergent if 
they were both serious and related to the study treatment.  
In the following tables and text, the term ‘AE’ will generally refer to a TEAE, unless otherwise specified. 
Relatedness to study treatment (decitabine and cedazuridine in FDC tablets or separate capsules) as 
assessed by investigators was used for the Applicant’s Summary of Clinical Safety. 
An overview of treatment-emergent AEs in the integrated population is presented in Table 41.

2.6.8.3.  Common adverse events 
In subjects with AML (N=80), the AEs with the highest incidence (≥20% of subjects), regardless of 
relationship to study medication, were anaemia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
nausea, asthenia, pyrexia, and pneumonia. 
In subjects with MDS/CMML (N=208), the AEs with highest incidence (≥20% of subjects), regardless 
of relationship to study medication, were anaemia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, asthenia, fatigue, oedema peripheral, pyrexia, 
pneumonia, decreased appetite, arthralgia, dizziness, headache, cough, and dyspnoea. 
Grade ≥3 adverse events 
In the subjects with AML (N=80), 88.8% reported at least one Grade ≥3 AE. The Grade ≥3 AEs that 
occurred with highest incidence (>20% of subjects) were thrombocytopenia, anaemia, febrile 
neutropenia, neutropenia, and pneumonia.  
In the MDS/CMML subject group (N=208), 95.7% reported at least one Grade ≥3 AE. The most 
frequently reported Grade ≥3 AEs (>20% of subjects) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, 
febrile neutropenia, and leukopenia. 
Treatment-related adverse events (as assessed by investigator) 
In subjects with AML (N=80), 61.3% reported at least one treatment-related AE. The treatment-
related AEs that occurred with highest incidence (>10% of subjects) were thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, anaemia, febrile neutropenia, and nausea.  
Treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs reported in ≥2 subjects with AML were thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, anaemia, and febrile neutropenia. 
In the MDS/CMML subject group (N=208), 82.2% reported at least one treatment-related AE. The 
most frequently reported treatment-related AEs (12% of subjects) were thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia, fatigue, and nausea.

Treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs reported in ≥2 subjects with MDS/CMML were neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and leukopenia. 
Adverse events in studies with cedazuridine alone 
Two studies in healthy subjects were performed administration of cedazuridine only. Study E7727-01 
was a mass-balance study with administration of a single 100 mg dose of cedazuridine. No AEs 
assessed as related to treatment were reported from this study.  
Study E7727-02 was a thorough QT study, which is further discussed below. Single doses of 100 mg 
and 400 mg cedazuridine, 400 mg moxifloxacine and placebo were administered to 31 subjects (one 
additional subject withdrew after the first period and was only treated with placebo). AEs were 
reported in 20/32 subjects (after cedazuridine or moxifloxacine). The most commonly reported AEs 
were dizziness (n=9), headache (n=4), medical device site reaction (n=4) and abdominal pain (n=4). 
Treatment-related AEs were reported in a total of 7/32 subjects (21.9%). Four (4) of the 7 AEs that 
were assessed as treatment-related were reported after administration of moxifloxacine or placebo. For 
cedazuridine (100 or 400 mg) the only treatment-related AEs were 2 cases of abdominal pain and one 
case of headache. All these reactions were of Grade 1 severity. 
2.6.8.4.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Treatment-emergent AEs with an outcome of death are summarised in Table 35 for the integrated 
population. 
In subjects with AML (N=80), 19 subjects (23.8%) had TEAEs with an outcome of death during the 
treatment period. Only 1 of the fatal TEAEs, was considered related to study treatment by the 
investigator.  
In subjects with MDS/CMML (N=208), 21 subjects (10.1%) had TEAEs with an outcome of death 
during the treatment period. Five subjects had TEAEs with an outcome of death considered treatment-
related by the investigator: myocarditis, pneumonia , sepsis , and septic shock . Three of these 
subjects had events considered related to IV decitabine (sepsis, pneumonia, and septic shock). The 
other TEAE of fatal pneumonia was considered related to ASTX727 by the investigator’s causality 
assessment. The event of myocarditis was considered by the investigator as related to ASTX727; 
however, the Applicant assessed the myocarditis as not related to study treatment because of 
concomitant positive blood culture. The Applicant also took into consideration that decitabine has no 
known cardiac liabilities, and there has been no clinical incidences of cardiac toxicity or nonclinical 
cardiac liabilities reported for cedazuridine. 
One subject died due to gastrointestinal perforation (Viscera perforation).. The event of viscera 
perforation was assessed as unrelated to ASTX727.

are summarised in Table 36.  
In subjects with AML (N=80), a total of 59 subjects (73.8%) had at least 1 SAE. The most commonly 
reported SAEs (>10% of subjects) were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Treatment-related SAEs 
occurred in 18 subjects (22.5%). Treatment-related SAEs were most commonly reported within SOC 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders (N=11) and Infections and infestations (N=6).  
In subjects with MDS/CMML (N=208), a total of 151 subjects (72.6%) had at least 1 SAE. The most 
commonly reported SAEs (>10% of subjects) were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and sepsis. 
Treatment-related SAEs occurred in 35 subjects (16.8%). Treatment-related SAEs were most

From data in the AML population (n=80), the Applicant discussed the following adverse events of 
special interest:  
• 
Myelosuppression events 
In the SOC Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, all grades TEAEs were reported by 85.0% of 
subjects, and CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 events were reported by 72.5% of the subjects with AML. The 
reported TEAEs for myelosuppression events (all grades) are as follows: leukopenia (11.3%); 
neutropenia (26.3%), and thrombocytopenia (58.8%).  
Febrile neutropenia is a distinct TEAE that was reported by 28.8% subjects; a majority of these events 
were CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 (26.3%). 
Anaemia was a grouped term in 62.5% subjects, which included distinct terms of anaemia (60%) and 
haematotoxicity (7.5%). Most of these grouped anaemia events were CTCAE Grade 3 or 4. One subject 
(1.3%) with AML had a CTCAE Grade 5 event of febrile neutropenia, which was considered unrelated to 
ASTX727 by the investigator. 
Assessment report

Page 99/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious AEs were reported by 31.3% of the 80 subjects with AML receiving ASTX727. The most 
commonly reported distinct SAEs (≥5% subjects) was febrile neutropenia (25.0%). Related SAEs in 
this SOC were reported by 13.8% of subjects, most commonly febrile neutropenia (11.3%).  
• 
Bleeding/haemorrhagic events 
Among subjects with AML (N=80), grouped haemorrhagic TEAEs reported by ≥5% of subjects are 
haematoma (12.5%), GI haemorrhage (8.8%), and epistaxis (6.3%). The majority of these TEAEs 
were low CTCAE grade. CTCAE Grade 3 or higher events are cerebral haemorrhage (1 subject) and 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage (3 subjects). 
Haemorrhagic SAEs in subjects with AML are gastrointestinal haemorrhage, haemorrhoidal 
haemorrhage, subdural haematoma, and haematoma (1 subject each; 1.3%) and cerebral 
haemorrhage (2 subjects; 2.5%).  
SAEs that were assessed as treatment-related were two cases of cerebral haemorrhage (2.5%). 
• 
Infection events 
Among subjects with AML (N=80), infection TEAEs (all grades) were reported by 70% of subjects, and 
CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 events were reported by 41.3% of subjects.  
Serious AEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported by 41.3% of the 80 subjects with 
AML receiving ASTX727. Related infection SAEs were reported for 6 subjects (7.5%): pneumonia (3 
subjects, 3.8%) and anal abscess, enterococcal bacteraemia, Escherichia bacteraemia, Escherichia 
urinary tract infection, pseudomonal bacteraemia, and sinusitis aspergillus (1 subject each, 1.3%) 
Reported CTCAE Grade 5 infection events in patients with AML were pneumonia (6 subjects, 7.5%), 
sepsis (1 subject, 1.3%), and septic shock (1 subject, 1.3%) as distinct ungrouped AEs. As described 
above, none of the fatal infections events in the AML population was assessed as related to ASTX727. 
• 
Gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary events 
Among subjects with AML (N=80), gastrointestinal TEAEs (all grades) were reported by 48.8% of 
subjects and CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 events were reported by 8.8% of subjects. 
Grouped gastrointestinal TEAEs reported by ≥5% of subjects with AML are nausea (21.3%), 
constipation (18.8%), diarrhoea (13.8%), vomiting (12.5%), stomatitis (10.0%), and gastrointestinal 
disorder and oral discomfort (5.0% each). Most of these reported TEAEs were low grade (Grade ≤3). 
CTCAE Grade 3 events were gastritis, neutropenic colitis, and stomatitis (1 subject each, 1.3%). 
There was one CTCAE Grade 5 event of gastrointestinal perforation in a subject with AML who received 
ASTX727; the event led to discontinuation of study drug, but was considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to study drug.  
TEAEs reported as related by 5% or more of the subjects are nausea (11.3%), constipation and 
diarrhoea (6.3% subjects each), and vomiting (5.0%).  
Two SAEs of CTCAE Grade 2 constipation and CTCAE Grade 2 diarrhoea were reported by 1 subject 
each, both unrelated to study treatment.  
In the Investigations SOC, a grouped TEAE of hepatic enzyme increased was reported for 10.0% of 
subjects with AML (all grades), and 2 subjects (2.5%) reported CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 events.  
Among subjects with AML (N=80), 23.3% to 43.7% of the subjects experienced a worsening of any 
grade for all of the above laboratory abnormalities. These abnormalities were low grade with 2.8% and 
2.7% subjects reporting CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 worsening for AST increased and ALT increased, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023

respectively. None of the subjects reported a worsening to CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 for alkaline 
phosphatase increased or bilirubin increased. 
• 
Cardiac events 
Among subjects with AML (N=80), cardiac TEAEs (all grades) were reported by 15.0% and CTCAE 
Grade 3 or 4 events were reported by 6.3% of subjects. Grouped TEAEs reported by 5% or more 
subjects are cardiac failure (8.8%) and arrhythmia (7.5%). 
The majority of reported cardiac TEAEs were low grade, non-serious, and not assessed as related to 
study treatment. CTCAE Grade 3 or higher events are distinct ungrouped AEs of cardiac failure 
(2 subjects, 2.5%), cardiac failure congestive (3 subjects, 3.8%) and cardiogenic shock (1 subject, 
1.3%). 
Serious TEAEs were reported by 3 (3.8%) subjects with AML: CTCAE Grade 3 cardiac failure 
(2 subjects, 2.5%), CTCAE Grade 5 cardiac failure congestive, and CTCAE Grade 1 tachycardia 
(1 subject each, 1.3%). None of the reported SAEs were considered related to treatment by the 
investigator. 
Two subjects had TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged, both of which were Grade 1 and 1 subject had CTCAE 
Grade 3 ejection fraction decreased. There was one related TEAE of CTCAE Grade 1 ECG QT prolonged. 
Among all subjects with AML who received ASTX727 (N=80), QTcF change from baseline of >60 ms 
was noted in 4 (5.0%) subjects, and QTcF > 500 ms among those subjects with QTcF ≤500 ms at 
baseline was noted in 2 (2.5%) subjects. The incidence of QTcF prolongation was comparable between 
ASTX727 and IV decitabine. 
• 
Renal and urinary events 
Among subjects with AML (N=80), renal TEAEs (all grades) were reported by 18.8% and CTCAE Grade 
3 or 4 events were reported by 7.5% of subjects. The most commonly reported grouped TEAE was 
acute kidney injury, reported by 11.3% (all grades) and 3.8% (CTCAE Grade 3 or 4). 
The following laboratory parameters were reported very commonly as worsening of any grade: 
creatinine increased, hyponatremia, hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia. All, except for hyperkalaemia, were 
reported commonly as worsening to CTCAE Grade 3 or 4. 
• 
Hypersensitivity events 
In the AML population (N=80), 1 subject (1.3%) reported a non-serious TEAE of hypersensitivity while 
on treatment with ASTX727 that was considered not related to study treatment by the investigator. 
• 
Skin events 
Among subjects with AML (N=80), a total of 13 (16.3%) reported TEAEs of skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders. These included the grouped terms blister, dermatitis, erythema nodosum, 
hyperhidrosis, petechiae and rash. All distinct skin and subcutaneous TEAEs were reported by ≤5% of 
subjects with AML. All of the reported events in the AML population were non-serious and exclusively 
low grade (Grade ≤3). 
2.6.8.6.  Thorough QT (TQT) study with cedazuridine  
Study E7727-02 was a Phase 1 study to determine QTc Effects of cedazuridine.  
The study was a randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled thorough QTc study 
with single therapeutic (100 mg) and supratherapeutic (400 mg) doses of cedazuridine in 32 healthy 
subjects. Subjects were randomised into one of 12 treatment sequences using a 3-Williams squares 
design. On each dosing day (Day 1 of each treatment period), subjects were administered 100 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 101/130 
 
 
 
cedazuridine, 400 mg cedazuridine, 400 mg moxifloxacin, or placebo with a 5-day washout between 
dosing. 
The results on QTc were evaluated using both concentration-QTc modelling and by-timepoint analysis, 
however, the primary analysis was based on concentration-QTc (C-QTc) modelling of the relationship 
between plasma concentrations of cedazuridine (and its metabolite cedazuridine-epimer) and change 
from baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) with the intent to exclude an effect of placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) 
>10 msec at clinically relevant plasma levels. 
Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by the positive control moxifloxacin. 
The concentration-time profiles, and exposure values in terms of Cmax and AUC, were similar for 
cedazuridine and the cedazuridine-epimer at both dose levels administered. The exposures increased 
in a less than dose-proportional manner after single doses of 100 mg and 400 mg cedazuridine (2.6-
fold [Cmax] and 2.7-fold [AUC] higher exposure at 400 mg compared to 100 mg). 
The model-estimated slope of cedazuridine plasma concentration in the concentration-QTc relationship 
was slightly negative and not statistically significant (-0.00068 ms per ng/mL [90% CI: -0.00 to 0.00]) 
with a not statistically significant treatment effect-specific intercept of -0.11280 ms (P=0.8844). The 
effect on ∆ΔQTcF at the geometric mean peak cedazuridine concentration can be predicted to -0.21 ms 
(90% CI: -0.75 to 0.33) and -0.54 ms (90%CI: -1.93 to 0.84) for the 100 mg (309.1 ng/mL; 
cedazuridine-epimer: 327 ng/mL) and 400 mg (791.2 ng/mL; cedazuridine-epimer: 837 ng/mL) dose 
groups, respectively (Figure 13).

adjusted ΔQTcF (PK/QTc analysis set) 
In the by-time point analysis on the QTcF interval, LS mean, SE, and 2-sided 90% CI of change-from 
baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) and placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) were calculated for each active dose 
group and moxifloxacin group as well as on placebo for ΔQTcF at each post-dose time point (Figure 
14).

2.6.8.7.  Laboratory findings 
Worsening to any grade increased liver function markers, hyperglycaemia, hyponatremia and increased 
creatinine were very common. However, worsening of these parameters to grade 3 or 4 was generally 
seen in < 5% of AML patients, which is in the same range as that reported for Dacogen (EPAR). 
Potential Hy’s law cases 
Laboratory data for the integrated population of Phase 2 and Phase 3 subjects were evaluated for 
potential Hy’s Law cases by identifying subjects with ALT >3×ULN and total bilirubin ≥2×ULN with 
alkaline phosphatase <2×ULN.  
None of the subjects in the AML population were potential Hy’s Law cases.  
Six subjects in the MDS population (3 subjects from the Phase 2 study for MDS and 3 subjects from 
the Phase 3 study for MDS) were identified as potential Hy’s Law cases, but further medical review 
found it unlikely that these cases represent liver injury related to treatment, because all 6 cases 
occurred in the setting of fatal AEs (myocarditis, sepsis, or cardiac failure). 
2.6.8.8.  Safety in special populations 
Age 
The safety profile of IV decitabine in elderly patients can be considered well established. 
In the AML study (ASTX727-02 EU; N=80), the majority of subjects were elderly with 49 subjects 
(61.3%) ≥75 years, 28 subjects (35.0%) ≥65 and <75 years of age, and 3 subjects (0.4%) younger 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 103/130 
 
 
 
 
 
than 65 years of age. No differences in safety were observed between age groups ≥65 years; the 
group of subjects < 65 years of age is too small to draw any conclusions.  
Table 44. safety profile in elderly patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 104/130 
 
 
 
 
 
Sex 
In the integrated population there were 95 females and 193 males. There were no obvious differences 
and, in general, the most frequently reported TEAEs (>20% of subjects) were the same in both groups 
(e.g., anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, and asthenia). 
Race  
The Applicant explains that although AE data by race were summarised for the integrated population 
as per the statistical analysis plan (SAP), collection of race and ethnicity data in certain countries in 
Europe (where the majority of sites were located in Study ASTX727-02 EU in subjects with AML) was 
prohibited. Therefore, the results of the analysis were deemed clinically irrelevant. 
Renal impairment 
The rates of reported anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia seemed to 
increase among subjects with AML as a function of renal dysfunction. However, among MDS subjects in 
a larger sample size (N=208), no significant increase in the same AEs was noted with worsening renal 
function.  
The rate of reported neutropenia among both AML and MDS populations is comparable among subjects 
with normal and mild renal dysfunction; however, there is a 20% increase in reported neutropenia with 
worsening of renal function from normal to moderate. Despite this increased rate of neutropenia, there 
is no corresponding increase in the rate of pneumonia when comparing normal and moderate renal 
dysfunction reported among both AML and MDS populations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 105/130 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The reported rate of diarrhoea and constipation among both AML and MDS populations did not increase 
with worsening hepatic function. While there was an increase in reported nausea and vomiting when 
comparing subjects with normal hepatic function to mild hepatic dysfunction, none of the reported 
events were CTCAE Grade 3 or higher. Despite an increased rate of neutropenia among subjects with 
moderate hepatic dysfunction for both subpopulations, there is no corresponding increase in the rate of 
pneumonia when comparing normal and moderate hepatic dysfunction reported among both AML and 
MDS populations. 
Body surface area 
The rates of all of the reviewed TEAEs for both AML or MDS subjects were consistent across BSA 
quartiles. No apparent increase was evident with decrease of BSA. Similar results were observed for 
TEAEs CTCAE Grade 3 or higher. 
2.6.8.9.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with cedazuridine or decitabine.  
2.6.8.10.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In subjects with AML (N=80), 11 subjects (13.8%) permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs. 
Discontinuation AEs reported for more than 1 subject were pneumonia (4 subjects; 5.0%) and 
asthenia (2 subjects; 2.5%). Three subjects with AML had discontinuation AEs considered related to 
treatment by the investigator: asthenia in 2 subjects (2.5%) and stomatitis in 1 subject (1.3%).  
In subjects with MDS/CMML (N=208), a total of 13 subjects (6.3%) permanently discontinued 
treatment due to AEs. Discontinuation AEs reported for more than 1 subject were febrile neutropenia 
(2 subjects; 1.0%) and pneumonia (2 subjects; 1.0%). Four subjects with MDS/CMML had altogether 
six discontinuation AEs considered related to treatment by the investigator; the reactions were febrile 
neutropenia (2 subjects; 1.0%) and Pure red cell aplasia (1 subject), and hypersensitivity, cardiogenic 
shock and myocarditis (1 subject). 
Dose modifications due to adverse events 
In study ASTX727-02, it was important that subjects completed Cycle 1 and 2 (ASTX727 and IV 
decitabine in a cross-over fashion) in order to fulfil the primary objective of the study. If dose 
reductions were necessary during Cycle 1 and 2, subjects were not included in the primary 
pharmacokinetic evaluation.  
From Cycle 3, dose reductions could be made by reducing the number of treatment days per cycle. 
According to protocol, dose reductions were to be considered if myelosuppression was suspected to be 
drug-related rather than disease-related. Dose delays (delaying the next cycle) to allow recovery of 
blood counts from drug-related myelosuppression were allowed at the discretion of the investigator. 
In subjects with AML (N=80), drug interruptions and dose reductions due to a TEAE occurred in 47.5% 
of subjects. The most common AEs (≥3% of subjects) that resulted in drug interruption or dose 
reduction during treatment with ASTX727 were neutropenia (10 subjects; 12.5%), haematotoxicity (6 
subjects; 7.5%), febrile neutropenia (4 subjects; 5.0%), pneumonia (4 subjects; 5.0%), and pleural 
effusion and thrombocytopenia (2 subjects each; 2.5%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 106/130 
 
 
 
In subjects with MDS/CMML (N=208), drug interruptions and dose reductions due to a TEAE  
occurred in 104 subjects (50.0%). Also in this group, the most common reason was haematologic 
toxicity including febrile neutropenia, followed by infections (most common: pneumonia). 
2.6.8.11.  Post marketing experience 
The most recent Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) for ASTX727 is based on a reporting 
period from 17 January 2021 to 16 January 2022. No new information from the postmarketing setting 
was obtained during the reporting period for ASTX727 that changes the benefit-risk profile of 
ASTX727. 
2.6.8.12.  Comparison of ASTX727 and IV decitabine 
In study ASTX727-02 EU and ASTX727-02 NA (AML and MDS/CMML patients, respectively) ASTX727 
and IV decitabine were administered in a crossover fashion in Cycle 1 and 2. Thus, half of the patients 
received ASTX727 and half of the patients received IV decitabine in the first two cycles. In the Clinical 
study reports, comparisons of AEs observed in Cycle 1 and 2 were presented for the two respective 
treatments. This comparison might, however, be somewhat confounded by carry-over effects from 
Cycle 1 to Cycle 2.  
The overall rate of AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs was similar for the two 
treatments during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.  
In both study populations, the rate of SAEs was higher after ASTX727 than after IV decitabine. SAEs 
were reported in 24% of AML patients after IV decitabine and 44% of AML patients after ASTX727 
(Table ).  In MDS/CML patients, SAEs were reported in 18% of patients after IV decitabine and 31% 
after ASTX727 (Table ). Confidence intervals for the rates of SAEs and treatment-related SAEs, were, 
however wide and largely overlapping (Table  and Table ). 
For AML patients, treatment related SAEs were reported in 15.2% of patients after ASTX727 and 6.4% 
of patients after IV decitabine. The total number of related events were 17 and 5, respectively. The 
most commonly reported treatment-related SAEs after ASTX727 in Cycle 1 or 2 were febrile 
neutropenia (n=5), pneumonia, anaemia and cerebral haemorrhage (n=2 each).  
For MDS/CMML patients, treatment related SAEs were reported in 8.5% of patients after ASTX727 
and 3.0% of patients after IV decitabine. The difference in the number of related events was, however, 
smaller in the MDS/CMML study (14 vs. 10 events for ASTX727 and IV decitabine, respectively). The 
most commonly reported treatment-related SAEs after ASTX727 in Cycle 1 or 2 were febrile 
neutropenia (n=7) and sepsis (n=2).

Table 48. Summary of Subjects Experiencing Treatment Emergent Adverse Events with Confidence 
Interval (Study ASTX727-02 NA; MDS/CMML) 
To avoid potential carry-over effects from Cycle 1 to Cycle 2, the Applicant presented a comparison of 
AEs in Cycle 1 only, after ASTX727 and IV decitabine, respectively. This comparison was only made for 
AML patients and is therefore hampered by the low number of subjects per group (n=42 for ASTX727 
and n=38 for IV decitabine).  
In general, the incidence of all adverse drug reactions is consistent between the 2 groups (Table 41).  
The rates of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting appeared higher after ASTX727 than after IV decitabine in 
Cycle 1 in patients with AML. When looking at the integrated population (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 data), a 
similar trend was seen in AML patients but not in MDS/CMML patients, for which GI events were overall 
Assessment report

more commonly reported than for AML patients. Gastrointestinal AEs of Grade ≥3 were reported in 
< 2% of patients after both treatments, in AML as well as MDS/CMML patients. 
Fatigue was more commonly reported for ASTX727 than for IV decitabine in Cycle 1 in patients with 
AML. This was also seen in MDS/CMML patients when comparing both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. The 
Applicant suggests fatigue may be secondary to other events, such as pneumonia, which was observed 
at a higher rate in the ASTX727 group, but considered a chance finding.

The Applicant also presented an indirect comparison of the safety data for ASTX727 (N=80 for AML 
and N=288 for the integrated population) with published data for Dacogen (N=293 for AML; EPAR, 
SmPC).  
The frequencies for nearly all ADRs reported with Dacogen were comparable in rate and severity to the 
ASTX727 dataset among subjects with AML. The most frequently observed ADRs in subjects with AML 
in the Dacogen group were directly related to myelosuppression or its consequences of fever and 
infection. A similar pattern of frequently observed ADRs was noted among subjects with AML treated 
with ASTX727.  
Furthermore, ADRs leading to dose delays were primarily due to myelosuppression or infection for both 
Dacogen and ASTX727.  
The most common AEs leading to death in subjects with AML for both treatments were infection 
events. 
When comparing ASTX727 and Dacogen in subjects with AML, there appears to be an isolated increase 
in anaemia reported with ASTX727 (60% vs. 38% [all grades] and 45% vs. 31% [CTCAE Grade 3 
or 4]). This increase is not accompanied by a suppression of a similar magnitude among all other cell 
lines (neutrophils, platelets). This may be a consequence of differences in sample size (N=80 for 
ASTX727 vs. N=293 for Dacogen). However, anaemia and all other cytopenias were reported as 
occurring very commonly in both subjects treated with ASTX727 and historical control Dacogen.  
The incidence of events reported in the GI SOC (diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, and stomatitis) in 
subjects receiving ASTX727 is not worse compared with Dacogen. 
2.6.9.  Adverse Drug Reactions for the label 
The Applicant proposes to base the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC primarily on previous 
experience with Dacogen, but with frequencies estimated from the group of 80 AML patients included 
in study ASTX727-02 EU. 
The following table is proposed for the SmPC, section 4.8:

2.6.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This application concerns ASTX727, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of a known substance, decitabine, 
and the cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor cedazuridine, which is a new chemical entity (NCE). The 
application involves a new route of administration for decitabine.  
The combination of decitabine and cedazuridine has been shown to increase systemic decitabine 
exposure (based on area under the curve; AUC) following oral administration relative to that observed 
with oral decitabine alone. 
Decitabine is previously approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation, Dacogen, for the same indication 
as that proposed for Inaqovi. The systemic toxicity of decitabine in AML patients has, thus, been 
previously established in studies with IV decitabine. The systemic safety profile of decitabine 
administered as ASTX727 may therefore be supported by a pharmacokinetic (PK) bridge from IV 
decitabine, under the assumption that a similar systemic exposure (plasma AUC) to decitabine will lead 
to a similar systemic safety profile. This approach has been agreed by the CHMP in scientific advice 
procedures and results described above.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 118/130 
 
 
 
A safety assessment is still necessary in order to identify potential additional or different toxicity due to 
the oral administration of decitabine, e.g. local toxicity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as the 
potential added toxicity from cedazuridine.  
The safety assessment is primarily based on the integrated population from Study ASTX727-02 EU in 
AML patients (n=80) and from Study ASTX727-02 NA and study ASTX727-01B in MDS/CMML patients 
(n=208), in which the final dose of ASTX727 was administered, i.e. 35 mg decitabine + 100 mg 
cedazuridine for 5 consecutive days of each 28-day cycle.  
The use of data from patients with MDS/CMML as well as AML to make an overall safety assessment is 
agreed, in order to increase the sample size. The differences in cytogenic profiles might not be 
expected to have a major impact on the safety profile and tolerability of ASTX727. However, as some 
AEs of decitabine might also be manifestations of the underlying disease, pooling of data from the AML 
and MDS/CMML studies may not be appropriate. Accordingly, in most analyses, the Applicant 
presented AML and MDS/CMML data separately. Further, the information in section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
on adverse drug reactions observed in the Inaqovi studies, is based on the AML population (n=80). 
Among a total of median 6 cycles (AML) or 7-8 cycles (MDS/CMML), all patients in the integrated 
population received one cycle of IV decitabine in Cycle 1 or Cycle 2, in a cross-over fashion with 
ASTX727. The safety profile over the whole treatment period therefore reflects both treatments.  
The Applicant also presented a direct comparison of AEs after ASTX727 and IV decitabine in Cycle 1 for 
AML patients and in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 for the both AML and MDS/CMML patients. this analysis has 
several limitations: The study design, primarily aiming at comparing pharmacokinetics, was not 
optimised to detect treatment differences in safety. The data is based on only one cycle of each 
treatment. Further, the analysis of Cycle 1 only includes a limited number of patients, as it is based on 
only AML patients, and only half of the patients received either treatment in Cycle 1 (approximately 40 
patients per treatment group). The comparison of AEs using data from both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 might, 
on the other hand, be diluted by carry-over effects from Cycle 1 to Cycle 2 in terms of treatment-
related AEs as well as AEs due to underlying disease or co-morbidities. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
In line with the demonstration of a similar exposure to decitabine after administration of ASTX727 and 
IV decitabine, the overall safety profile observed in the Phase 2/Phase 3 studies with ASTX727 in AML 
or MDS/CMML patients was similar to what has been previously reported for Dacogen and what could 
be expected in these patient populations. Thus, haematologic suppression and gastrointestinal (GI) 
disorders were very commonly reported, as were different types of infections. Haematological toxicity 
and infections were also the most commonly reported AEs of Grade 3 or higher. No new, important 
safety issues were identified that could be attributed to cedazuridine.  
In a direct comparison of ASTX727 and IV decitabine in Cycle 1 and 2 of study ASTX727-02, where the 
two treatments were administered in a cross-over manner, the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) 
was about twice as high after ASTX727 than after IV decitabine. This was seen also in terms of SAEs 
that were considered treatment-related by the investigator, although the latter might possibly, to same 
extent, be attributed to the open-label design of the study. For AML patients, but not for MDS/CMML 
patients, a similar imbalance was seen for fatal AEs. As discussed above, however, the study design 
was not optimised for comparing safety between the two treatments. With relatively small groups, and 
small numbers of SAEs and fatal AEs, the confidence intervals for the estimated rates of such events 
were wide and largely overlapping between groups.   
Over the complete treatment period, SAEs (assessed as unrelated or related) were most commonly 
reported within SOCs Infections and infestations and Blood and lymphatic tissue disorders, followed by 
gastrointestinal disorders. During Cycle 1 and 2, when the comparison of treatments was made, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 119/130 
 
 
 
most commonly reported PTs were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia and sepsis (observed after both 
treatments). Other SAEs reported during the first two cycles included cellulitis (3 cases each after 
ASTX727 and IV decitabine), asthenia (2 cases, for ASTX727 only), anaemia, multiple organ failure 
(one case for ASTX727), acute renal failure (one case each after ASTX727 and IV decitabine), cerebral 
haemorrhage (2 cases for ASTX727). There were 9 and 3 fatal AEs after ASTX727 and IV decitabine, 
respectively, during the first two cycles. Only one of these fatal AEs (cerebral haemorrhage, observed 
after ASTX727) was considered treatment-related. Other fatal AEs included pneumonia (n=2 per 
treatment) and septic shock (n=1 per treatment), multiple organ failure, febrile neutropenia, general 
physical health deterioration, respiratory distress and sudden death (n=1 each, all for ASTX727). The 
sudden death was reported as related to significant co-morbidity. The pattern of SAEs and fatal AEs 
may be considered as expected for the patient population and/or decitabine treatment, and it is 
acknowledged that most SAEs and fatal AEs were not considered treatment-related.   
Considering the new, oral route of administration of decitabine, it is of particular interest to look at the 
GI adverse events for potential local toxicity. In AML patients (n=80), the rate of GI events indeed 
seemed higher after ASTX727 than after IV decitabine in Cycles 1 and 2. This trend was, however, not 
seen in the larger group of MDS/CMML patients. Further, the overall rate of GI events was not higher 
in the ASTX727 studies than what is reported in the Dacogen SmPC. The events were generally of 
Grade 1-2 in severity.  
Importantly, the GI adverse events appear to have been tolerated in the ASTX727 studies, as they did 
not lead to dose modification or treatment discontinuations, except in one case of stomatitis. Thus, 
altogether, the potential difference between ASTX727 and IV decitabine in terms of reported GI events 
in the ASTX727 studies is not considered to negatively impact the B/R balance specific to oral 
decitabine in combination with cedazuridine, or to cancel the benefits of having an orally administered 
treatment option for these patients.  
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage was reported in altogether 8.0% (Grade ≥3 in 2.7%) of the integrated 
population. Bleeding events were generally considered treatment-related, and due to 
thrombocytopenia. Such events have been reported also for Dacogen. The gastrointestinal 
haemorrhagic events reported for ASTX727 are not considered likely to be directly related to the local 
exposure to decitabine at oral administration, but rather to thrombocytopenia induced by the systemic 
exposure to decitabine.  
Fatigue was more commonly reported for ASTX727 than for IV decitabine in Cycle 1 in patients with 
AML. This was also seen in MDS/CMML patients when comparing both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Fatigue was 
reported as reason for treatment discontinuation in altogether two patients (both with AML). Fatigue is 
not listed as ADR in the SmPC for Dacogen. The Applicant suggests that fatigue and some other ADRs 
observed in the ASTX727 studies but not listed for Dacogen (e.g. rash, pleural effusion, cough, 
hypoxia) are more likely secondary to other events, such as infections, than a direct effect of ASTX727 
treatment.   
Overall, the reasons for treatment discontinuation and dose modification do not lead to new concerns 
for ASTX727 in comparison with Dacogen.  
Special populations 
As expected for patients with AML and MDS/CMML, the majority of patients in the integrated safety 
population were elderly. The safety profile of decitabine in elderly patients can be considered well 
established, both in the ASTX727 studies and previously for Dacogen. There is no reason to expect a 
different safety profile for ASTX727 by age than for IV decitabine.  
Decitabine is not eliminated unchanged in urine to any relevant extent. However, for cedazuridine, the 
renal route is a major elimination pathway. An increase in cedazuridine levels at decreased renal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 120/130 
 
 
 
function could theoretically lead to an increase in decitabine levels, if CDA inhibition increases. As 
expected for an elderly patient population, the ASTX727 integrated safety population included a 
relevant number of patients with mild renal impairment. It is agreed that no specific recommendations 
for patients with mild renal impairment are necessary, other than what is recommended for all patients 
(AE monitoring and dose adjustment). However, the number of patients with moderate renal 
impairment was low, and there were no patients with severe renal impairment.  
In the proposed SmPC for Inaqovi, the normal starting dose is recommended for patients with 
moderate renal impairment but due to an increased risk for AEs, patients with moderate renal 
impairment should be monitored. Given the theoretical risk of increased CDA inhibition and thereby 
increased decitabine levels, this appears to be a reasonable recommendation. A warning has been 
introduced in Section 4.4 regarding patients with severe renal impairment, due to the lack of data in 
this patient group.  
The number of patients with hepatic impairment was low, and it is difficult to draw conclusions on the 
risk for increased toxicity based on AE data only. Large effects of hepatic impairment on cedazuridine 
exposure are not expected as cedazuridine is not hepatically metabolised. Thus, there appears to be no 
theoretical reason to expect a different safety profile for ASTX727 in patients with hepatic impairment 
than for IV decitabine. Taking into account potential hepatotoxic effects of decitabine, 
recommendations for moderate to severe hepatic impairment have been introduced in the SmPC, in 
line with the Dacogen SmPC. 
Cedazuridine  
There is very little clinical data on the administration of cedazuridine alone. As described in the non-
clinical assessment report, there were large margins between the No-effect level in toxicology studies 
and clinical exposure to cedazuridine.  
Further, as discussed above, there were no new, unexpected findings in the ASTX727 studies 
compared with the known safety profile for Dacogen that could potentially be attributed to 
cedazuridine.  
The impact of cedazuridine exposure on the QTc prolongation was studied in healthy subjects (Study 
E7727-02) with supratherapeutic doses 100 and 400 mg. The results showed a non-statistically 
significant treatment effect.  The results (ΔΔQTcF) lie within the accepted ranges. 
The concentration-QTc relationship has also been evaluated in patients (Study ASTX727-02). The 
analysis explored the relationship between the change from baseline in QTc interval and mean plasma 
concentrations   of decitabine, cedazuridine, and cedazuridine-epimer. The linear regression showed 
that the slope of the relationship between the change from baseline of QTcF and cedazuridine and 
cetabine was very flat. The model predicted QTcF change at 3h in subjects treated with ASTX727 was 
6.96 ms (-1.14-15.07) as a function of cedazuridine concentration and 5.33 ms (-2.11-12.76). In the 
case of patient treated with IV decitabine, the predicted QTcF change to day 3 at 1h was 1.98 (-4.25-
8.02).In conclusion, cedazuridine is considered unlikely to relevantly affect the safety profile for 
ASTX727 compared with IV decitabine.  
SmPC 
The systemic safety profile of decitabine is assumed to be the same after administration of ASTX727 
and Dacogen, given a similar systemic exposure. Potential differences in the safety profile between 
ASTX727 and Dacogen would therefore be expected to be due to either the new route of administration 
of decitabine (such as local GI toxicity) or to cedazuridine. The data presented, however, indicates no 
apparent differences between the safety profile for ASTX727 and that previously known for Dacogen, 
that could potentially be attributed to either the oral administration route of decitabine or to 
Assessment report

cedazuridine. Accordingly, the Inaqovi SmPC includes largely the same safety information as the 
Dacogen SmPC (in sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9). The exception is information directly related to 
the IV formulation or route of administration, and information concerning the paediatric population, 
which has been deferred for Inaqovi.  
The proposed SmPC section 4.2 includes recommendations for missed or vomited doses. These 
recommendations are in line with the study protocol recommendations and are considered appropriate. 
2.6.11.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In line with the demonstration of a similar exposure to decitabine after administration of ASTX727 and 
IV decitabine, the overall safety profile observed for ASTX727 in AML and MDS/CMML patients, 
respectively, was similar to what has been previously reported for Dacogen and what could be 
expected in these patient populations. There were no new findings in the ASTX727 studies compared 
with the known safety profile for Dacogen that could possibly be attributed to cedazuridine or to the 
new, oral route of administration of decitabine. Thus, from a safety perspective, no objections to 
approval of Inaqovi have been identified.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 06 July 2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Inaqovi (decitabine / cedazuridine) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for ASTX727 is “Inaqovi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for standard induction 
chemotherapy.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 125/130 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Curative therapies, including intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, are 
generally applicable to the minority of patients who are younger, while most older individuals exhibit 
poor prognosis and survival. 
Patients not suitable for induction therapy (generally >65 years old and/or with significant co-
morbidities) are often treated with HMAs administered parenterally which imposes a significant 
treatment burden. The HMAs decitabine (Dacogen) and azacitidine (Vidaza) are approved by the EMA 
for adult patients with AML who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy. 
An orally available HMA would reduce the burden of chronic treatment for patients and their 
caregivers. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The primary data supporting the safety and efficacy for the AML indication are from the phase 3 study 
ASTX727-02 EU. This was a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence 
crossover study of oral ASTX727 versus IV decitabine.  
Adult subjects with AML who were candidates to receive IV decitabine were randomised in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive the ASTX727 FDC tablet Daily×5 in Cycle 1, followed by IV decitabine 20 mg/m2 Daily×5 in 
Cycle 2, or the converse order. Eighty-nine subjects with AML were randomised and 87 were treated 
(80 of whom received at least 1 dose of ASTX727) as of the data cutoff date (10 September 2021). 
The primary aim of the study was to demonstrate similar AUC for decitabine delivered through oral 
ASTX727 at the proposed dose as for IV decitabine at the approved dose, in the treatment of adult 
patients with AML. 
Thus, the present application is based on a PK bridge to IV decitabine, assuming that previous efficacy 
and safety data for this dose and route of administration can be extrapolated to ASTX727 if the 
decitabine plasma exposure (total AUC over the 5-day cycle) is similar.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 5-day total decitabine AUC0-24hr between Inaqovi and IV 
decitabine was 99% for patients with MDS/CMML and 100% for patients with AML (90% confidence 
interval [CI] 93% - 106% and 91% - 109% for MDS/CMML and AML, respectively). 
Thus, bioequivalence for 5-Day AUC0-24 between oral and IV decitabine was convincingly demonstrated. 
AUC0-24 for day 1 is lower for oral compared to IV treatment and Cmax is also lower following oral 
treatment (22-28% lower on day 5). To support the assumption that Cmax differences do not matter, 
the applicant recorded the maximum percent LINE-1 demethylation in peripheral blood. This was 
comparable between Inaqovi and IV decitabine in the Phase 3 Study ASTX727-02 in AML as well as 
MDS/CMML patients. 
The complete response (CR) rate in patients treated sequentially with Inaqovi and IV decitabine (with 
either then one or the other given first) was 21% [13.4, 31.3]. The duration of CR was 5.8 months 
[3.3, NE]. These figures are roughly similar to what was historically seen with IV decitabine alone 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/402324/2023  
Page 126/130 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Inaqovi is given as a flat dose (35 mg decitabine) while IV-decitabine is given as a body-surface 
adjusted dose (20 mg/m2). There is a trend of decreased decitabine 5-day AUC0-24 with increasing 
weight or BSA with oral decitabine treatment, but this is not considered to be clinically relevant.  
Cmax is not bioequivalent, and as anticipated somewhat higher with IV decitabine administration. 
However, theoretical considerations on the role of AUC versus plasma Cmax, as well as the impact on 
LINE-1 demethylation, support that this would not impact the efficacy of Inaqovi relative to IV 
decitabine. 
Since all patients in the pivotal trial received one cycle of IV decitabine (cycle 1 or 2), the CR rate do 
not completely isolate the effect of Inaqovi. Moreover, the pivotal trial is essentially a single arm trial 
with a nested cross-over of two decitabine formulations. Single arm trials do not isolate the effect of 
the test agent on time dependent endpoints such as PFS and OS. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety assessment is primarily based on the integrated population from Study ASTX727-02 EU in 
AML patients (n=80) and from Study ASTX727-02 NA and study ASTX727-01B in MDS/CMML patients 
(n=208).  
The overall safety profile observed in the Phase 2/Phase 3 studies with ASTX727 in AML or MDS/CMML 
patients was similar to what has been previously reported for Dacogen and what could be expected in 
these patient populations. Thus, haematologic suppression and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were 
very commonly reported, as were different types of infections. Haematological toxicity and infections 
were also the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) of Grade 3 or higher.  
Considering the new, oral route of administration of decitabine the overall rate of GI events was not 
higher in the ASTX727 studies than what is reported in the Dacogen SmPC. The events were generally 
of Grade 1-2 in severity and did not lead to dose modification or treatment discontinuation. 
A direct safety comparison with decitabine IV is issued from data of the Cycle 1 in the cross-over study 
ASTX727-02 EU (N=42 for ASTX727 and 38 for IV decitabine). In general, the incidence of all ADRs is 
consistent between the 2 groups, but incidence of pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infection, 
bacteraemia, polyserositis, periodontitis, pleural effusion and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, 
diarrhoea, vomiting) was higher in the ASTX727 group while cytopenias were higher in the IV 
decitabine group (except from febrile neutropenia). The comparison is, however, based on a very 
limited number of subjects and should be interpreted with caution. The potential difference between 
ASTX727 and IV decitabine in terms of these reported events is not considered to outweigh the 
benefits of having an orally administered treatment option for these patients. 
In a thorough QT study with cedazuridine in healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant effects of single 
doses of 100 mg or 400 mg (supratherapeutic dose) cedazuridine on studied ECG parameters were 
observed. There were also no apparent differences in QTcF changes after administration of ASTX727 
and IV decitabine, respectively, in Studies ASTX727-01B and ASTX727-02 (EU, NA). 
Overall, the safety profile of Inaqovi is globally in accordance with what could be expected from a 
cytotoxic compound in such a setting. Most common adverse events are already known for decitabine 
IV and manageable. Decitabine in ASTX727 has known risks of cytotoxicity, mainly haematologic 
toxicity (myelosuppression) and infection consequences due to neutropenia. ASTX727 also contains a 
new chemical entity, the CDA inhibitor cedazuridine, which has not shown additional risks.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The key uncertainty is based on the limits of the size of the safety database for new chemical entity 
cedazuridine, whereby rare side effects may remain unidentified. There are no signals from non-clinical 
studies with cedazuridine alone used in higher doses than the one clinically proposed that warrants 
further clinical investigation. Routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient to capture signal of 
eventual rare side effects.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Since AUC over one treatment cycle (5 consecutive treatment days per 28-day cycle) is similar for oral 
decitabine (35 mg decitabine in combination with 100 mg cedazuridine) and for decitabine given IV at 
the recommended dose (20 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days per 28-day cycle), it can be inferred 
that the efficacy of ASTX727 at the proposed dose is similar to that of IV decitabine at the approved 
dose, in the treatment of adult patients with AML. 
The overall safety profile observed for ASTX727 in AML and MDS/CMML patients, respectively, was 
manageable, acceptable, and roughly similar to what has been previously reported for Dacogen in the 
relevant patient populations. There were no new findings in the ASTX727 studies compared with the 
known safety profile for Dacogen that could be attributed to cedazuridine or to the new, oral route of 
administration of decitabine. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance for ASTX727 (Inaqovi) administered orally at the proposed dose, i.e. 35 mg 
decitabine + 100 mg cedazuridine per day, for 5 consecutive days per 28-day cycle) is therefore 
supported to be the same as for IV decitabine, administered as 20 mg/m2 per day, for 5 consecutive 
days per 28-day cycle and previously been deemed positive by the CHMP. 
The final indication for Inaqovi is acceptable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Inaqovi is positive subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.  
Assessment report

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Inaqovi is not similar to Dacogen, Mylotarg, Xospata, 
Daurismo, Vyxeos liposomal, Rydapt and Tibsovo within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Inaqovi is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Inaqovi is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that cedazuridine is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

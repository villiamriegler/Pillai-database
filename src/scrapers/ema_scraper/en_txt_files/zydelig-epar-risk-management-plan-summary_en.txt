SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN ZYDELIG (IDELALISIB)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zydelig. The RMP details important 
risks of Zydelig, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Zydelig’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Zydelig’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zydelig should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Zydelig should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Zydelig’s 
RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What is it Used for
Zydelig is authorized for the treatment of certain patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains idelalisib as 
the active substance and it is given by mouth.
Further information about the evaluation of Zydelig’s benefits can be found in Zydelig’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage:

II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of Zydelig, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Zydelig’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of Zydelig, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Zydelig is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Zydelig are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Zydelig. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of Important Risks
Zydelig has been assigned the legal status of a medicine subject to medical prescription in the 
European Union (EU), whereby therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the 
management of anticancer therapies (as described in section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Hepatotoxicity including Transaminase Elevation and Hepatocellular Injury
High grade transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies of Zydelig. 
Increases in liver transaminases were generally observed within the first 12 weeks of 
treatment and were reversible with dose interruption. There have also been reports of 
hepatocellular injury, including hepatic failure, some of which were associated with a 
fatal outcome. The relationship of these events of hepatocellular injury to Zydelig is 
unclear.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Known history of drug-induced liver injury, chronic active HCV, chronic active HBV, 
alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, 
ongoing extrahepatic obstruction caused by stones, cirrhosis of the liver or portal 
hypertension, elevated liver function tests.

Important Identified 
Risk
Severe Diarrhoea/colitis
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Cases of severe diarrhoea/colitis (≥ Grade 3) associated with idelalisib have occurred 
relatively late (months) after the start of therapy with idelalisib. Most cases resolved 
within a few weeks with drug interruption and additional treatment (eg, antidiarrheal 
and anti-inflammatory agents such as enteric budesonide), but some have been 
associated with a fatal outcome.

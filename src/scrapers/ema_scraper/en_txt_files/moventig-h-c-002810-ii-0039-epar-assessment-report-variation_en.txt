2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a complication of opioid therapy, in which constipation is the most 
common and problematic symptom (Farmer et al., 2019). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Moventig is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have 
previously been treated with a laxative. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Opioids are a class of potent analgesics, and their use has increased markedly in recent years. Opioids 
are associated with a variety of bothersome side effects such as sedation, lethargy and pruritus, 
notwithstanding the considerable risk of addiction. Opioids also adversely impact the sensorimotor 
function of the gastrointestinal tract, via the action of exogenous opioid agonists, on the enteric 
nervous system. Such adverse effects limit dose escalation and can necessitate a switch in opioids or 
even cessation of therapy. The term opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) encompasses a 
spectrum of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, bloating, gastro-oesophageal reflux-related 
symptoms and constipation. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common subtype of OIBD 
that occurs in 51–87% of patients receiving opioids for cancer and between 41–57% patients receiving 
opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (Farmer et al., 2019). 
Clinical presentation 
The term opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) encompasses a spectrum of symptoms including 
nausea, vomiting, bloating, gastro-oesophageal reflux-related symptoms and constipation. Opioid-
induced constipation (OIC) is the most common subtype of OIBD that occurs in 51–87% of patients 
receiving opioids for cancer and between 41–57% patients receiving opioids for chronic non-cancer 
pain (Farmer et al., 2019). 
Management 
The pathophysiology of opioid-induced constipation is multi-faceted and the key aspect of managing 
opioid-induced constipation is early recognition. Specific management includes increasing fluid intake, 
exercise and standard laxatives as well as addressing exacerbating factors. Second-line treatments can 
be considered in those with recalcitrant symptoms, which include gut-restricted or peripherally acting 
mu-opioid receptor antagonists. However, a combination of interventions may be needed (Farmer et 
al., 2019).  
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 5/39 
 
 
 
Standard laxatives, such as osmotic agents (macrogol) and stimulants (bisacodyl, picosulphate and 
senna) are good first-line choices in the management of OIC (Farmer et al., 2019). 
Opioid-receptor antagonists can alleviate the adverse effects of opioids on GI functions, but their 
central analgesic effects may also be antagonised if they cross the blood-brain barrier. The most 
readily well-known example is naloxone, commonly used as an intravenous reversal agent in the 
context of opioid over-dosing. Agents that block mu-opioid receptors in the GI tract, but do not enter 
the central nervous system (CNS), are expected to treat OIBD without diminishing central analgesic 
actions. Several opioid antagonists with local action within the gut or (outside the CNS) peripherally-
acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) have become available such as methylnaltrexone, 
naldemedine and naloxegol (Farmer et al., 2019). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Moventig is a medicine used in adults to treat constipation caused by pain relief medicines called 
opioids. It is used in patients in whom treatment with laxatives has failed. 
The active substance in Moventig, naloxegol, is a peripheral mu-opioid-receptor antagonist. This means 
that it attaches to a specific type of opioid receptor called the ‘mu-opioid receptor’ and blocks opioids 
from binding to these receptors. Naloxegol is derived from naloxone, a well-known substance that is 
used to block the action of opioids. Naloxegol is less able to enter the brain than naloxone, meaning 
that it can block the mu-opioid receptors in the gut but less in the brain. By blocking receptors in the 
gut, Moventig reduces the constipation due to opioids, but does not interfere with their pain relief 
effects. 
Moventig (naloxegol) was approved by the EMA in 2014 for the treatment of opioid-induced 
constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s). It was 
recommended to halt other maintenance laxative therapy at initiation until the clinical effect of 
naloxegol was determined (SmPC 4.2) and in addition, experience in cancer pain related OIC was 
minimal (as described in 4.4 of the SmPC).  
In several publications, the efficacy and safety of naloxegol with or without standard laxatives in 
cancer pain related OIC is discussed, and the MAH presents data from these studies (Cobo Dols, Beato 
Zambrano, Cabezón-Gutiérrez, et al., 2021; Cobo Dols, Beato Zambrano, Cabezón Gutiérrez, et al., 
2021; Davies et al., 2022; Lemaire et al., 2021).  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. The EMA Guideline on the evaluation of 
medicinal products for the treatment of chronic constipation (including opioid induced constipation) and 
for bowel cleansing is applicable for the assessment of this procedure. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
N/A 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 6/39 
 
 
 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) had already been undertaken for naloxegol (previously 
known as NKTR-118) in accordance with EMA Guidance (CHMP 2006) at initial Marketing Authorisation. 
This ERA utilized the default values for the Default Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
Calculation, which remains unchanged. As the applicant withdrew the claim to extend the indication 
(please also refer to the chapter “discussion on clinical efficacy) there will be no increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of naloxegol.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In support of the changes in section 4.1, no (new) clinical data were submitted by the applicant. 
Instead, the MAH provided argumentation that the new indication may better reflect the class 
recommendation for PAMORAs (De Giorgio, et al., 2021) and the way Moventig is used in clinical 
practice. 
In support of the proposed changes in section 4.2 and 4.4, the applicant submitted a clinical overview 
in which real world data, i.e. observational studies (Kyonal, NACASY and MovE), are briefly discussed 
through the citing of the content of publications. No results were submitted that were generated in 
controlled clinical studies and, in a recent Cochrane review on mu-opioid antagonists for opioid-induced 
bowel dysfunction in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care, it was reported that at 
present no clinical trials with naloxegol have published results (Candy, Jones, Vickerstaff, Larkin, & 
Stone, 2022). The SmPC changes for which the MAH seeks approval are i) approval of the concomitant 
use with standard laxatives and ii) deletion of the statement that experience in OIC patients with 
cancer related pain is limited. Furthermore, editorial edits are proposed to other parts of the SmPC.  
In response to the first list of outstanding issues, the MAH pooled the data from three observational 
studies, Kyonal, NACASY and MovE, to allow a more consistent analysis of 4 week efficacy and safety 
data. Real world evidence from these studies was requested for inclusion in 5.1. of the SmPC. 
The proposed changes to 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC are reflected in the below table.

2.4.1.  Main study(ies) 
KYONAL study 
A prospective, observational study of a cohort of patients with cancer and with OIC exhibiting an 
inadequate response to laxatives and treated with naloxegol.  
The primary endpoint was the assessment of constipation-related quality of life in the patients 
receiving naloxegol, using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAC-
QOL), in its validated Spanish version. Changes in the total or subscale scores of ≥0.5 points were 
considered clinically relevant. A higher PAC-QOL score means poorer quality of life. 
The secondary endpoints included evaluation of the efficacy of naloxegol in treating OIC over follow-
up, defined as the proportion of responders: patients with three or more bowel movements a week, 
and one or more bowel movements a week additional to the number of bowel movements at baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023

As secondary efficacy endpoint, constipation symptoms were evaluated using the Patient Assessment 
of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) in its validated Spanish version, referred to the last 2 weeks. 
The safety of naloxegol treatment was assessed based on the adverse reactions described during 
patient follow-up.  
Results of the three month follow-up (Cobo Dols, Beato Zambrano, Cabezón Gutiérrez, et al., 2021) 
and 12 month follow-up (Cobo Dols, Beato Zambrano, Cabezón-Gutiérrez, et al., 2021) were published 
and discussed by the MAH, and included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Results 
Cobo Dols 2021a: 3 month follow up 
A total of 126 patients (58.2% males) with a mean age of 61.3 years (range 34–89) were included. 95 
patients completed the 3 months of follow-up. 3 patients discontinued the study due to physician 
decision; 10 discontinued the study due to patient decision; 1 patient was lost to follow-up; and 17 
patients had died because of their oncological disease. 
During the study, 63.2% of the patients (n=43) received concomitant treatment with laxatives. At 
baseline, 63.2% of the patients (n=74) were receiving chemotherapy and 85.2% (n=98) were 
receiving treatment with other drugs that could cause constipation. 
A total of 82.5% of the patients (n=85) responded to treatment with naloxegol after 15 days, 83.2% 
after 1 month (n=79) and 87.7% after 3 months (n=64). Seventeen patients (13.5%) experienced 
some adverse reaction (AR) to naloxegol, mostly of a GI nature. 
Significant improvement of OIC-related QOL was observed as early as 15 days (in 63% patients) after 
the start of the treatment and persisted during the 3 months (in 75.4% patients) to follow-up. 
Evolution of the mean PAC-QOL score is shown in Figure 1. A statistically significant increase in the 
mean number of days a week with complete spontaneous bowel movements from baseline (p<0.0001) 
was observed over all the study visits (Figure 2).Clinical symptoms efficacy assessed by the PAC-SYM 
questionnaire also yielded statistically significant findings. The proportion of patients with clinically 
relevant improvement was 64.5% after 15 days and 84.1% after 3 months.

The authors concluded that naloxegol as treatment for OIC in patients with cancer with an inadequate 
response to laxatives was more effective than expected. 
This study provides support for the efficacy and safety of naloxegol in OIC patients with cancer-related 
pain, including patients taking concomitant laxatives. 
Cobo Dols 2021b: 12 month follow up 
A total of 126 patients (58.7% males) with a mean age of 61.5 years (95% CI [59.4 to 63.7]) were 
included. PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL total scores and all their dimensions improved from baseline 
(p<0.0001) and between all the subsequent visits. At 12 months, 77.8% of the patients were 
responders to naloxegol treatment. The percentage of patients with clinically relevant improvement in 
the total PAC-QOL score was 50.8% after 15 days, 60.3% after 1 month, 61.9% after 3 months, 
57.1% at 6 months, and 58.7% at 12 months. Additionally, the proportion of patients with clinically 
relevant improvement in the total PAC-SYM scores was 54.8% after 15 days, 63.5% after 1 month, 
64.3% after 3 months, 64.3% at month 6, and 65.9% at month 12. At 12 months, 77.8% of patients 
responded to naloxegol treatment. For the global QOL, there were no significant changes from baseline 
to 6 and 12 months. 
Concomitant laxatives use was reported in 61 (48.4%) of the patients. 9 patients (7.1%) needed 
rescue laxatives: lactulose (39.4%), macrogol (26.8%) and bisacodyl (9.9%). No significant response 
rate differences were demonstrated by dose and/or concomitant laxative use. However, for patients 
treated with doses of 25 mg of naloxegol, a slight but not significantly better response rate for patients 
on concomitant laxatives was observed (Figure 3). The authors speculate that this could be attributable 
to concurrent non-OIC constipation in the patients who had some prior constipation before initiation of 
treatment with opioids (27.8%), and patients receiving concomitant treatment with other drugs that 
could induce non-OIC constipation (84.9%). In both of these cases additional laxatives with other 
mechanisms of action would be expected to be beneficial.

Figure 3 Response rate to naloxegol according to use of concomitant laxative 
A total of 28 ARs, mainly GI were observed in 15.1% of the patients (19/126), being 75% (21) mild, 
17.9% (5) moderate and 7.1% (2) severe. Most ARs (67.9%) appeared in the first 15 days of 
treatment. All ARs were resolved. Six patients were withdrawn from the study due to ARs: abdominal 
pain (6), nausea (1), diarrhoea (2). 
3 patients with ARs were on concomitant treatment with other laxatives. In 4 patients naloxegol was 
temporarily suspended, in 1 patient the naloxegol dose was reduced and in 17 patients no action was 
taken. During the study, 53 patients died from causes related to their malignant disease with no 
differences from the expected cancer-related incidence. 
The results of this first long-term and real-world-data study in patients with cancer, showed the 
sustained efficacy and safety of naloxegol for the treatment of OIC in patients with cancer related pain. 
NACASY study 
The NAloxegol CAncer StudY (NACASY) was a prospective, observational, single-arm, open-label, 
multinational European study aimed to evaluate the 4-week safety and efficacy of naloxegol in a real-
world setting in patients with cancer pain diagnosed with OIC.  
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of adverse events (AEs) leading to study 
discontinuation. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the response rate during the 4 weeks of treatment. Response rate 
was defined as the proportion of participants reporting ≥3 BM (without the use of rescue laxative 
treatment in the previous 24 h) per week and an increase of ≥1 BM over baseline.  
Results of the study were published (Davies et al., 2022) and presented in the clinical overview.  
Results 
The study recruited 170 patients from 26 European centres, who received at least 1 dose of naloxegol 
(i.e., safety population), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the response rate during the treatment 
time. There were 2 efficacy populations studied: population 1 – subjects who had completed 4 weeks 
of treatment and 28 days of the diary, and population 2 – subjects who had completed at least 21 days 
of the diary and were not study discontinuous. 183 patients were recruited for this study, and 170 
were analysed (n=170 for the safety analysis, n=143 for the efficacy of which n=76 were in population 
1, and n=98 were in population 2).

At baseline, 104 of 143 (72.7%) subjects were receiving conventional laxatives, and the corresponding 
proportions at visits 2 and 3 were 105/140 (75%) and 43/118 (36.4%), respectively. Osmotic and 
stimulant laxatives were the most frequently used at every study visit (data not shown). Furthermore, 
the most frequently used baseline laxatives were: osmotic laxatives (79.8%), stimulant laxatives 
(30.8%), stool softeners (11.58%), and other (18.3%, enema being the most common, with 9.6%). 
The study results were not presented separately for subgroups defined by laxative use. 
Overall, 89 of 170 study subjects (52.4%) reported at least 1 AE, and 38 (22.4%) were recorded as 
serious AEs. There were 21 deaths in the study with 1 of these (intestinal perforation) having a 
possible causal relationship with naloxegol. Treatment-related AEs (n=23, 13.5%) were mainly GI 
(Table 2), the most frequently reported being abdominal pain (n = 14, 8.2%) and diarrhoea (n = 5, 
2.9%). Except for a case of intestinal perforation that was categorized as grade 5, the remaining 
evaluable AEs were graded 1-3. There were 2 (1.2%) treatment-related AEs that were considered 
serious: a case of grade 5 intestinal perforation and a case of grade 2 diarrhoea. The intestinal 
perforation occurred in a 68-year-old male, diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, and with a 
medical history of gastric bypass surgery. Shortly after initiating treatment with 25 mg of naloxegol, 
the patient experienced rapid deterioration of the general state, showed signs of peritonitis, sepsis and 
multiorgan failure, and finally died. An autopsy was not performed, and the event was categorized by 
the investigator as probable intestinal perforation. 
Out of 170 patients, 20 (11.8%, 95% CI [6.9-16.6]) discontinued the study due to AE, and, of them, 
12 (7.1%, [3.2-10.9%]) were study discontinuations due to naloxegol-related AEs. These were mainly 
GI side effects, including 8 cases of abdominal pain, 2 cases of diarrhoea, and 1 due to the fatal 
intestinal perforation; the remaining patient discontinued the study due to fatigue.  
From 76 patients who had completed both 4 weeks of treatment and 28 days of the diary, 55 patients 
(72.4%, [62.3-82.4%]) were regarded as responders (i.e., showed ≥3 bowel-movements per week and 
an increase of ≥1 bowel-movement over baseline) to naloxegol treatment. The PAC-QOL total score 
and all its subscales improved from baseline to 4 weeks of follow up. 
The authors consider that the findings support and provide new evidence about the beneficial effect of 
naloxegol in terms of improvement of constipation and QOL in patients with cancer-related pain and 
OIC and show a safety profile consistent with previous pivotal and real-world studies. The study also 
supports continuing use of laxatives during the initiation of naloxegol treatment. 
MovE study 
The MovE study, reported by Lemaire et al. (Lemaire et al., 2021), was a non-interventional 
prospective, multicentre French real-world study, with a 4-week follow-up period investigating the 
effectiveness of naloxegol in patients with cancer pain suffering from OIC. This study, conducted in 24 
French oncology and pain centres between 2018 and 2019, mainly aimed to assess in real-life 
conditions the efficacy and safety of naloxegol in cancer pain patients and the evolution of their QOL. 
Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years, treated with opioids for cancer pain, and started naloxegol for 
OIC with inadequate response to laxatives. 
The primary efficacy criterion was the response rate to naloxegol at week 4 (defined as follows: ≥ 3 
bowel movements during the 4th week, with or without combined laxatives during follow-up, and an 
increase of ≥ 1 bowel movement per week between inclusion and W4.) Additionally, the PAC-QOL was 
used to measure the evolution of QoL. The analysis of the primary efficacy criterion (response rate in 
patients with or without concomitant laxatives, based on the data reported by the physicians) was 
repeated in the subgroups of patients with and without laxatives during study follow-up and using data 
from the 28-day diaries completed by patients.

Results 
A total of 124 patients were included, with 86 patients (69.4%) completing the study at week 4. The 
main reasons for early study termination included patient death, patient decision, and lost to follow-up. 
The patients’ characteristics were: mean age, 62 ± 12 years; ECOG ≤ 2, 79%; primary cancer, lung 
18%, breast 16%, prostate 11%, head and neck 9%, digestive 9%; metastatic stage, 80%. At 
inclusion, the median opioid dosage was 60 mg of oral morphine or equivalent. 
In the efficacy population, at week 4 (W4), 73.4% of patients had a clinically relevant change in QoL, 
which was a decrease in PAC-QOL score of ≥0.5 point. Additionally, amongst the analysed patients, 
most physicians and patients were satisfied with the treatment at week 4, with ratings of ≥5 observed 
in 81.4% and 72.4% of the cases, respectively. 
The response to treatment at W4 (primary criterion) was reached by most of the 79 evaluable patients 
in the efficacy population (73.4%, 95% CI [63.7–83.2%]), irrespective of the use of laxatives during 
patient follow-up (76.7% [66.0–87.4%] and 63.2% [41.5–84.8%], respectively, with and without 
laxatives). The proportions of responder patients at the 4th week are graphically presented with their 
associated confidence intervals in Figure 4. 
At least 1 AE was reported by 43 patients (32.8%), including 21 patients (16%) reporting at least 1 
serious AE. AEs related to naloxegol were reported in 8% of patients (7% with GI events mainly 
diarrhoea; 1 serious diarrhoea). The safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile. 
Figure 4 Response to naloxegol at week 4 in the MovE Study. 
The 73% overall response rate to naloxegol at week 4 was higher than in previous clinical trials 
conducted in non-cancer patients, with no concomitant laxative use permitted (48.7% and 46.8% at 
week 12 in the KODIAC-04 and KODIAC-05 studies, respectively). Even if it is recommended in Europe

that all currently used maintenance laxative therapy should be halted when naloxegol therapy is 
initiated, in this real-world study, the majority of the patients received concomitant laxatives during 
follow-up. This therapeutic choice of physicians involved in the care of cancer patients may be 
explained by the multifactorial cause of the constipation that may require treatments with synergetic 
mechanisms of action. Recent real-world studies conducted in cancer patients with OIC also showed 
similar high response rates under naloxegol treatment. Finally, the high overall response rate to 
naloxegol is constant with available literature data in cancer patients with OIC. The differences in 
proportion could be explained by potential concomitant laxatives but also by other treatments taken by 
such cancer patients in a real-life setting (in particular in metastatic patients) as, in this study, the 
authors stated that most patients in both groups (with or without combined laxatives) also received 
treatments that could lead to constipation. 
The authors concluded that in this real-world study, naloxegol was effective and well tolerated in 
cancer pain patients with OIC and that their quality of life improved under treatment. This study also 
supports the introduction of naloxegol in addition to existing conventional laxative treatments. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Nalopool 
In its response to the first round of outstanding issues, the applicant submitted an analysis of pooled 
data from the observational studies Kyonal, NACASY and MovE.  
This pooling is most relevant for the expansion of the clinical safety experience with naloxegol in two 
conditions that were not investigated in the original naloxegol studies, i.e. use in cancer pain OIC 
patients and use concomitantly with standard laxatives.  
The pooled data, which concerned a 4 week treatment period in which efficacy and safety of naloxegol 
was investigated in cancer pain OIC patients, confirmed the efficacy of naloxegol in treatment of OIC in 
cancer pain patients, either with or without concomitant laxatives.  
The Nalopool is a pooled database that combines clinical data from the first 4 week treatment period of 
3 studies, the KYONAL, MOVE and NACASY studies, and comprises real-world data from 420 patients 
with cancer pain and OIC.  
All three studies included adult patients with cancer pain requiring treatment with opioids and who 
experienced OIC. With slight differences across studies, OIC definitions were compatible with Rome IV 
criteria. All three studies use non-stringent exclusion criteria with slight differences among them. 
Efficacy 
Primary efficacy endpoints for the Nalopool study were SBM and PAC-QOL, investigated in the 
individual studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 14/39 
 
 
 
The studies each contributed about one third of patients in the Nalopool. Mean and median age and 
BMI were comparable in between studies. The majority of patients was male in the Kyonal and Move 
studies, and female in the Nacasy study. 65% of patients had metastases indicating in general a 
population with advanced cancer was recruited. Fentanyl, oxycodone and morphine were mostly used, 
and about one third of patients had received more than one opioid. Median and mean time of opioid 
use were 8.9 weeks and 24.9 weeks indicating this opioid usage distribution was right skewed. Osmotic 
laxatives had been used by 90% of patients.  
83% of patients initiated naloxegol treatment on a 25 mg dose, and 43% used concomitant laxatives 
(for the latter, no Kyonal study data were available). During the study, opioid product changes and 
opioid dose increases were noted, the latter in 16.1% of patients. 10% of patients discontinued 
naloxogel during the respective studies.  
The efficacy assessment was performed for the efficacy population, N=393 (defined as all patients who 
meet all selection criteria, received at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least one post-baseline 
efficacy assessment). 
Primary efficacy endpoint 1: Spontaneous bowel Movements (SBM) 
Response has been defined with the following: 
- SBM response: three or more SBM per week at visit week 4. 
- SBM strict response: three or more bowel SBM with an increase of one or more SBM over baseline. In 
Nacasy study the increase of 1 SBM from baseline is assumed, when patients reach 3 SBM/week, due 
to study characteristics (All patients included in Nacasy study had less than 3 SMB at baseline, before 
naloxegol start date). 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 15/39 
 
 
 
 
Primary efficacy endpoint 2: Quality of life – PAC-QOL 
PAC-QOL Quality of life response has been defined as improvement of at least 0.5 points in the PAC-
QoL total score (reduction of 0.5 points). 60% of the patient population of the Nalopool population 
demonstrated a clinically relevant response at week 4 of treatment. The PAC-QOL score was shown to 
be statistically different between week 4 and baseline for all subscales and for the global PAC-QOL 
score.  
Secondary efficacy endpoint: Impact on constipation symptoms 
PAC-SYM 
Constipation symptoms were measured using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-
SYM) scale in the KYONAL and MOVE studies (The PAC-SYM score was not evaluated in the Nacasy 
study). A reduction was seen in all dimensions of the PAC-SYM and statistically significant differences 
(all p≤0.001 using T-Student test for paired samples) were found between baseline and week 4 in all 
subscales and global score.  
PAC-SYM response has been defined as improvement of at least 0.5 points in the PAC-SYM scores 
(reduction of 0.5 points).  
Bowel Function Index 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 16/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bowel Function Index (BFI) was assessed in the MOVE and NACASY studies (BFI was not evaluated 
in the Kyonal study.). A reduction was seen in all dimensions of the BFI. Statistically significant 
differences (all p<0.001 using T-Student test for paired samples) were found between baseline and 
week 4 in all subscales and global score.  
BFI response was defined as improvement of at least 12 points in the BFI total score (reduction of 12 
points). The percentage of BFI responders was 73.4% in the MOVE study and 64.7% in the NACASY 
study, giving an overall response rate of 68.2%. 
Concomitant use of laxatives 
As described under Baseline Characteristics, all evaluable subjects had received at least 4 weeks of 
prior laxative treatment. Concomitant use of laxatives was reported by 114 patients (42.7%).  
Additional Nalopool analyses could not detect any significant influence of concomitant laxative use on 
the efficacy of naloxagol. There was a trend to higher response rate without concomitant laxative use 
(p=0.053) which seems contradictory at first sight but which likely reflects the increased use of 
concomitant laxatives by patients who don’t initially respond to naloxegol alone, or who have additional 
constipation of a separate non-OIC etiology. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No clinical data were submitted in support of the proposed change in therapeutic indication.  
KYONAL study 
At first sight, the presented data suggest that the use of naloxegol in the treatment of cancer pain 
related OIC is efficacious and safe, both at 3 months and 12 months of follow up, and both with and 
without the concomitant use of standard laxatives. However, a detailed analysis of the methodology 
and the results is not possible due to the nature of these data (scientific publication) and the limited 
amount of information submitted and discussed by the MAH. Some crucial study details are lacking in 
the clinical overview presented by the MAH.  
Furthermore, serious concerns on the analysis of the original data remain. For the final intention-to-
treat analysis adjusted for missing data in the efficacy variables the last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) method was used. This approach is considered not acceptable because of the high number of 
dropouts in the study (29 of 126 patients were still included after 1 year) and because it cannot simply 
be assumed that a (non)response would have been preserved over time in the individual patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 17/39 
 
 
 
 
 
Stating that a PAC-QOL score of 58.7% (n=74) is observed at month 12 knowing that only 29 patients 
are still enrolled in the study at that time point, is not credible nor scientifically justified. 
NACASY study 
The data presented suggest that the use of naloxegol in the treatment cancer pain related OIC is 
efficacious and safe at four weeks of treatment, both with and without the concomitant use of standard 
laxatives. The primary efficacy endpoint (response rate based on bowel movement) was evaluated at 
week 4. A four week treatment period to assess efficacy and safety is considered sufficient in the OIC 
setting in patients with malignancy-related pain.  
MovE study 
The response to treatment at W4 (primary criterion) was reached by most of the 79 evaluable patients 
in the efficacy population (73.4%, 95% CI [63.7–83.2%]), irrespective of the use of laxatives during 
patient follow-up (76.7% [66.0–87.4%] and 63.2% [41.5–84.8%], respectively, with and without 
laxatives). The 73% overall response rate to naloxegol at week 4 was higher than in previous clinical 
trials conducted in non-cancer patients, with no concomitant laxative use permitted (48.7% and 46.8% 
at week 12 in the KODIAC-04 and KODIAC-05 studies, respectively). In this real-world study, the 
majority of the patients received concomitant laxatives during follow-up.  
The MovE study data have been pooled by the MAH with Kyonal and NACASY study data to further 
establish efficacy and safety in cancer pain patients suffering from OIC with or without concomitant 
laxative use and expand clinical experience in these patients.  
Cancer-pain OIC patients were not included in the pivotal phase 3 naloxegol studies. Although the 
clinical efficacy response is not considered to be different in cancer pain patient vs non-cancer pain 
patients, the following warning was included in the Moventig SmPC in section 4.4 at initial marketing 
authorisation: There is limited clinical experience with the use of naloxegol in OIC patients with cancer-
related pain. Therefore, caution should be used when prescribing naloxegol to such patients. The MAH 
now presents additional data in support of the safe use of the product in cancer pain OIC patients to 
expand the clinical experience in these patients. Naloxegol use is contraindicated in some malignant 
conditions, but they are not the scope of this variation, and this contraindication remains. 
In addition, no concomitant laxatives were used in the clinical studies in support of the naloxegol 
indication. The SmPC currently states that when naloxegol therapy is initiated, it is recommended that 
all currently used maintenance laxative therapy should be halted, until clinical effect of naloxegol is 
determined. The concomitant use with standard laxatives is not explicitly forbidden in the SmPC. The 
MAH now presents additional data in support of the safe use of naloxegol together with standard 
laxatives, in cancer pain OIC patients. Since the original approval of Moventig, the EMA has issued a 
guideline (Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products for the treatment of chronic constipation 
(including opioid induced constipation) and for bowel cleansing, EMA/CHMP/336243/2013) which 
supports such add-on therapy approach in cancer pain OIC patients.  
Observational study data are presented to substantiate the efficay and safety of naloxegol in cancer 
OIC patients that cannot be sufficiently treated with standard laxatives. In these studies, naloxegol 
was used with and without standard laxatives. The study data from three studies have been pooled for 
analysis in the Nalopool database. 
Nalopool database 
In the Nalopool database, data from the first 4 weeks of treatment were analysed. This is in line with 
the EMA guideline which states that in case an efficacy study is conducted in cancer pain OIC patients, 
the randomised treatment period may need to be shortened. However, it is considered that usually, at 
least a 4-week period may be needed to adequately assess efficacy and safety. In addition, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 18/39 
 
 
 
guideline states that the withdrawal of the “usual” laxative medication may be skipped when 
investigating OIC in patients with underlying malignant conditions. In this case, an “add-on- setting” 
can be investigated. Of note, the EMA guideline was developed for prospective, clinical studies, the 
studies included in the Nalopool database were observational.  
The display of the primary efficacy results is considered acceptable. The concerned guideline states 
that “In a situation when the conduct of efficacy study(ies) is considered necessary in OIC, it is 
generally expected that recruitment may turn out to be difficult in cancer pain patients. Therefore, it is 
considered acceptable to base the primary evaluation of efficacy on a numerical scale, in order to avoid 
the reduction of power with the construction of responder analyses.” Here, a responder analysis 
however is presented.  
The results for the SBM response and SBM strict response are fairly comparable, showing 77% and 
71% response rate, respectively. The CHMP considers these results as clinically relevant because of the 
magnitude of effect that is shown. For comparison, in the pivotal phase III studies in non-cancer pain 
OIC, the placebo effect for a (different) SBM-based response rate was about 30%.  
The PAC-QOL results are in line with the SBM data and further support the efficay of naloxegol in this 
patient population. A clinically relevant PAC-QOL response was observed in 60% of patients.  
The PAC-SYM results are in line with the SBM data and further support the efficay of naloxegol in this 
patient population. A clinically relevant PAC-SYM response was observed in 69% of the patients in 
which this outcome was measured.  
The BFI results are in line with the SBM data and further support the efficay of naloxegol in this patient 
population. A clinically relevant BFI response was observed in 68% of the patients in which this 
outcome was measured. 
In conclusion, the efficacy analyses of the pooled data from three observational studies show very 
consistent responses over the individual endpoints, supporting the use of naloxegol in the treatment of 
OIC in cancer pain patients. Accordingly the deletion of the precautionary statement on the use in OIC 
patients with cancer related pain from chapter 4.4 of the SmPC is supported. The existing 
contraindication in patients with heightened risk of GI perforation remains.  
Concomitant laxative use was not allowed in the pivotal phase 3 trials for Moventig in the treatment of 
OIC non-cancer pain patients but is accepted in clinical practice in cancer pain OIC patients. As is 
stated in the guideline, in cancer pain OIC patients the mechanism for constipation may be from other 
causes related to the malignancy and not just be from opioids. The guideline supports that withdrawal 
of the “usual” laxative medication is skipped and an “add-on- setting” is investigated. In the current 
Moventig SmPC, the concomitant use with standard laxatives is not explicitly forbidden, but 
recommended to be halted until the effect of naloxegol is established. 
The presented data do not raise concerns with regard to the efficacy of naloxegol in patients 
concomitantly taking laxatives and can be considered supportive amending 4.2 of the SmPC in order to 
allow the concomitant use of laxatives without stopping the maintenance laxative first. As the 
mechanism of action of Naloxegol is the same in cancer and non-cancer pain OIC patients the 
observations are considered to apply for cancer pain and non-cancer pain OIC patients.  
The applicant further applies for implementing data from studies Kyonal, NACASY and MovE into 5.1. 
of the SmPC. 
However the CHMP did not agree with including this observational data due to quality concerns and 
suitability for the SmPC. The methodological and statistical concerns, such as the aspect of "(lack of) 
predefinition" and data-driven analysis, had not been solved convincingly, and bias (primarily 
confounding by indication) cannot be excluded. Taking into consideration the SmPC guideline stating 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 19/39 
 
 
 
that “It may be appropriate to provide limited information, relevant to the prescriber, such as the main 
results (statistically compelling and clinically relevant) regarding pre-specified end points or clinical 
outcomes in the major trials and giving the main characteristics of the patient population. Such 
information on clinical trials should be concise, clear, relevant and balanced, and should summarize 
evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication.” The CHMP, whilst agreeing on the supporting 
evidence for the changes in 4.2 and 4.4. as outlined in this report disagreed to include this RWE into 
5.1 of the SmPC. The MAH agreed with this approach. 
The MAH submitted a variation application under category C.1.6.a of the variation classification 
Guideline with the scope to “Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to 
update information regarding the use of naloxegol in OIC patients with cancer-related pain based on 
real-world data from non-interventional studies (NACASY, KYONAL, and MOVE studies), post-marketing 
data, and literature. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 8 has also been 
submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes to the SmPC. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).” 
Based on the assessment of the data contained in the application, the CHMP is of the view that the 
following changes to the MA should be introduced ““Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC based 
on real-world data from non-interventional studies (NACASY, KYONAL, and MOVE studies), post-
marketing data, and literature on the use of naloxegol in OIC patients with cancer-related pain. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The RMP version 8.2 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement 
editorial changes to the SmPC” These changes fall under category C.1.4 of the variation classification 
Guideline.  
During the procedure, the MAH updated the product information accordingly.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data from the individual observational studies and the analysis of pooled data confirmed the efficacy of 
naloxegol in the treatment of OIC in cancer pain patients, with or without concomitant laxatives. Since 
the bulk of efficacy data for naloxegol had been generated in controlled clinical trials, and a similar 
effect was expected in cancer pain patients, the expansion of clinical experience in cancer pain patients 
with data from observational studies is acceptable, since they only serve to further support an already 
granted indication. Accordingly, the applied changes to 4.2 and 4.4. are considered acceptable. 
In accordance with the SmPC guideline the addition of data from RWE studies Kyonal, NACASY and 
MovE into 5.1 of the SmPC was not agreed. This claim was withdrawn by the applicant during the 
procedure. 
The MAH proposed to change the approved therapeutic indication as follows: Moventig is indicated for 
the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have previously been treated 
with a laxative, removing the restriction of the indication to laxative inadequate responders. However, 
no new data were submitted in support of the proposed change in therapeutic indication and the 
extension the indication claim was only supported based on the argument that the new indication may 
better reflect the class recommendation for PAMORAs (De Giorgio, et al., 2021) and the way Moventig 
is used in clinical practice. 
However, the data availible on Moventig and assessed at the time of the initial marketing authorisation 
only supported a positive B/R in an OIC population with a documented inadequate response to 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 20/39 
 
 
 
laxatives, and not in the population where such inadequate response was not documented, even 
though many of the latter patients had used a standard laxative before at some point. Results from the 
observational studies MovE, NACASY and KYONAL were also generated in a population with a 
documented inadequate response to laxatives.  
The proposed change was therefore considered non-approvable by the CHMP. The applicant finally 
withdrew their claims to amend the therapeutic indication and to add the RWE data into the SmPC.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
NACASY Study  
Overall, 89 of 170 study subjects (52.4%) reported at least one adverse event, and 38 (22.4%) were 
recorded as serious adverse events. The most frequent (i.e., adverse events with an incidence rate of 
≥5%) are presented in Table S3. There were two cases of withdrawal syndrome that were categorized 
as grade 1. Adverse events considered to be related to naloxegol were reported in 23 patients 
(13.5%). Treatment-related adverse events were mainly gastrointestinal events, the most frequently 
reported being abdominal pain (n = 14, 8.2%) and diarrhea (n = 5, 2.9%). Except for a case of 
intestinal perforation that was categorized as grade 5, the remaining evaluable adverse events were 
graded 1 to 3 (Table 2).  
There were two (1.2%) treatment-related adverse events that were considered serious adverse 
reactions: a case of grade 5 intestinal perforation and a case of grade 2 diarrhea. The intestinal 
perforation occurred in a 68 years-old male, diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, and with a 
medical history of gastric bypass surgery. Shortly after initiating treatment with 25 mg of naloxegol, 
the patient experienced rapid deterioration of the general state, showed signs of peritonitis, sepsis and 
multiorgan failure, and finally died. Autopsy was not performed, and the event was categorized by the 
investigator as probable intestinal perforation. 
Table 2. Adverse reactions to naloxegol (according to CTCAE v4.03). 
Out of 170 patients, 20 (11.8%, 95%CI 6.9–16.6) discontinued the study due to adverse events, and, 
of them, 12 (7.1%, 95%CI 3.2–10.9%) were study discontinuations due to naloxegol-related adverse 
events. These were mainly gastrointestinal side effects, including eight cases of abdominal pain, two 
cases of diarrhoea, and one due to intestinal perforation; the remaining patient discontinued the study 
due to fatigue. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023

KYONAL study 
A total of 28 adverse reactions mainly gastrointestinal were observed in 15.1% of the patients 
(19/126), 75% (21) mild, 17.9% (5) moderate and 7.1% (2) severe. Most adverse reactions (67.9%) 
appeared in the first 15 days of treatment with naloxegol (median of 13 days), and described as 
abdominal pain (13), abdominal bloating (5), diarrhoea (6), nausea (3) and dysesthesia (1). All the 
adverse reactions were solved. A total of six patients withdrawn from the study due to adverse 
reactions: abdominal pain (6), nausea (1), diarrhoea (2). The withdrawal due to adverse reactions 
occurred before day 15 in three patients, and between 15 and 30 days in three patients. Five patients 
were in treatment with 25 mg of naloxegol and one at the 12.5 mg dose. Three patients with adverse 
reactions were on concomitant treatment with other laxatives. Additionally, in four patients naloxegol 
was temporarily suspended, in one patient the naloxegol dose was reduced and in 17 patients no 
action was taken. During the study 53 patients died from causes related to their malignant disease 
considering no differences from expected cancer-related incidence. No patients withdrew from the 
study due to suspension of treatment with opioids. 
MovE Study 
At least one adverse event (AE) was reported in 43 patients (32.8%) during the study (median follow-
up of patients, 4.3 months; range, 0.3–14.9), including 21 patients (16.0%) with at least one serious 
AE (SAE). Among the 15 AEs related to naloxegol according to investigators (11 patients, 8.4%), the 
most common events were gastrointestinal disorders (12 events reported in 9 patients, 6.9%) 
(Table 3). Among these 12 gastrointestinal AEs, 6 diarrheas were reported in 5 patients (3.8%), all of 
them having started naloxegol at the dose of 25 mg. One non-serious withdrawal syndrome was 
reported. Only one related SAE was reported (diarrhea, 0.8% of patients). Thirty AEs experienced by 
22 patients (16.8%) led to naloxegol discontinuation during the study, mainly as cancer progression (8 
events, 6.1% of patients) and diarrhea (4 events, 3.1% patients, all of them in the 25-mg group). 
Thirteen deaths were associated with AEs, without causal relationship with naloxegol as assessed by 
physicians. 
Nalopool 
In its response to the first round of outstanding issues, the applicant submitted an analysis of pooled 
data from the observational studies Kyonal, NACASY and MovE. Refer to Annex 2, assessment of the 
MAH’s responses, for further details.  
This pooling is most relevant for the expansion of the clinical safety experience with naloxegol in two 
conditions that were not investigated in the original naloxegol studies, i.e. use in cancer pain OIC 
patients and use concomitantly with standard laxatives. Of note, both are currently already in the 
Moventig label, but with warnings.  
The analysis of safety data (N=427) coded adverse events using MedDRA version 23.1 across the three 
studies. NCI-CTCAE grades (1-5) were used in the MovE and Nacasy studies to assess intensity, while the 
Kyonal study used the classiﬁca�on: Mild, Moderate, Severe and Serious. 
AE related to naloxegol (per Inves�gator) (AE-RPI) were reported by 11.7% of pa�ents during the 4 week 
nalopool analysis period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023  
Page 22/39 
 
 
 
The most common AE-RPI was abdominal pain which was reported by 24/427 (5.6%) pa�ents. There 
were 3 serious AE-RPI: a Grade 1 diarrhea, a Grade 2 diarrhea, and a Grade 5 (fatal) intes�nal perfora�on. 
AE-RPI led to discon�nua�on of naloxegol in 26 pa�ents (6.1%). The most common AE-RPI leading to 
discon�nua�on were abdominal pain (n=14), diarrhea (n=6) and nausea (n=4). No other terms led to 
discon�nua�on in more than 1 pa�ent. 
A supplementary analysis explores the incidence of AE-RPI by concomitant laxa�ve use during the 
Nalopool period. There were no notable diﬀerences in overall rates of AE-RPI, Serious AE-RPI, or AE-RPI 
leading to discon�nua�on and the proﬁle of AE-RPI reported in pa�ents taking concomitant laxa�ves was 
not meaningfully diﬀerent to that of pa�ents who did not take concomitant laxa�ves.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In its response to the first round of outstanding issues, the applicant submitted an analysis of pooled 
data from the observational studies Kyonal, NACASY and MovE (Nalopool). This pooling is most 
relevant for the expansion of the clinical safety experience with naloxegol in two conditions that were 
not investigated in the original naloxegol studies, i.e. use in cancer pain OIC patients and use 
concomitantly with standard laxatives. Of note, both are currently already in the Moventig label, but 
with warnings. 
In the 4 week analysis period, adverse reactions related to the use of naloxegol were identified in 11% 
of patients, the most common being abdominal pain. In 6% of patients, adverse reactions led to the 
discontinuation of naloxegol treatment. In total 3 RPI serious adverse reactions were identified. The 
safety pool contained 427 patients, which is considered sufficiently large. For comparison, naldemedine 
(Rizmoic) data presented in the Rizmoic SmPC were generated in 2 clinical trials where in total 155 
cancer pain patients received naldemedine.  
A supplementary analysis explored the incidence of adverse reactions by concomitant laxative use. 
According to the MAH there were no notable differences in overall rates of AE-RPI, Serious AE-RPI, or 
AE-RPI leading to discontinuation and the profile of AE-RPI reported in patients taking concomitant 
laxatives was not meaningfully different to that of patients who did not take concomitant laxatives. The 
relative occurrence of adverse reactions was numerically lower in those patients taking concomitant 
laxatives (5%) compared to those patients not taking concomitant laxatives (15%). A similar 
observation was made with regard to serious adverse reactions which all three occurred in those 
patients that were not taking concomitant laxatives. Likewise, discontinuations due to adverse 
reactions were 9% in the patient population not on concomitant laxatives and 3% in the population 
that used concomitant laxatives. These results indicated that naloxegol can be safely used 
concomitantly with standard laxatives.  
Altogether, the safety analysis shows that no new safety concerns were identified and that adverse 
reactions due to naloxegol treatment occurred at a low frequency in cancer pain OIC patients. In 
addition, the number of serious adverse reactions was very limited. Concomitant use of standard 
laxatives did not increase safety concerns, and numerically, adverse reactions occurred less frequently 
in patients that used concomitant laxatives. Accodingly the changes made to the SmPC in 4.2 
(Moventig may be used with or without laxatives) and in 4.4. deletion of a precautionary statement in 
OIC patients with cancer related pain due to limited clinical experience can be agreed from a safety 
perspective. Further, adding a sentence in 4.2 of the SmPC that Moventig treatment should be 
withdrawn when systemic opioid therapy is stopped is agreed with due to the mechanism of action of 
the drug being a mu-opioid receptor antagonist. 
No clinical data were submitted in support of the proposed change in therapeutic indication.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Data from the individual observational studies (Kyonal, NACASY and MovE) and the analysis of pooled 
data (Nalopool) confirmed the safety of naloxegol in the treatment of OIC in cancer pain patients, with 
or without concomitant laxatives. Since the bulk of safety data for naloxegol had been generated in 
controlled clinical trials in non-cancer patients, a safety based warning was issued in the Moventig 
SmPC, stating that the clinical experience in cancer pain patients was limited. Based on the safety data 
from the Nanopool safety set, which comprised 427 patients and which was reassuring with regard to 
safety of naloxegol in this patient population, it is agreed that the following statement is removed from 
the SmPC: 
Assessment report

Page 25/39 
 
 
 
“Cancer related pain 
There is limited clinical experience with the use of naloxegol in OIC patients with cancer-related pain. 
Therefore, caution should be used when prescribing naloxegol to such patients (see section 4.3).” 
Safety was also compared in patients using naloxegol with and without concomitant laxatives, in the 
Nanopool dataset. The safety profile in patients taking concomitant laxatives was reassuring and 
numerically less adverse events related to naloxegol were observed in patients concomitantly taking 
standard laxatives compared to those that did not. In current label, it was recommended to halt 
standard laxatives until the naloxegol effect was established. However, based on the reassuring 
observational study data, there is no scientific rationale to further support this statement and the 
following change in section 4.2 is considered acceptable: 
Moventig may be used with or without laxatives. Moventig treatment should be withdrawn when 
systemic opioid therapy is stopped. 
Altogether, the safety of naloxegol in cancer pain OIC patients, with or without concomitant laxatives, 
is confirmed to be reassuring by data from observational studies.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a complication of opioid therapy, in which constipation is the most 
common and problematic symptom (Farmer et al., 2019). 
Opioids are a class of potent analgesics, and their use has increased markedly in recent years. Opioids 
are associated with a variety of bothersome side effects such as sedation, lethargy and pruritus, 
notwithstanding the considerable risk of addiction. Opioids also adversely impact the sensorimotor 
function of the gastrointestinal tract, via the action of exogenous opioid agonists, on the enteric 
nervous system. Such adverse effects limit dose escalation and can necessitate a switch in opioids or 
even cessation of therapy. The term opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) encompasses a 
spectrum of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, bloating, gastro-oesophageal reflux-related 
symptoms and constipation. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common subtype of OIBD 
that occurs in 51–87% of patients receiving opioids for cancer and between 41–57% patients receiving 
opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (Farmer et al., 2019). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The pathophysiology of opioid-induced constipation is multi-faceted and the key aspect of managing 
opioid-induced constipation is early recognition. Specific management includes increasing fluid intake, 
exercise and standard laxatives as well as addressing exacerbating factors. Second-line treatments can 
be considered in those with recalcitrant symptoms, which include gut-restricted or peripherally acting 
mu-opioid receptor antagonists. However, a combination of interventions may be needed (Farmer et 
al., 2019).  
Standard laxatives, such as osmotic agents (macrogol) and stimulants (bisacodyl, picosulphate and 
senna) are good first-line choices in the management of OIC (Farmer et al., 2019). 
Opioid-receptor antagonists can alleviate the adverse effects of opioids on GI functions, but their 
central analgesic effects may also be antagonised if they cross the blood-brain barrier. The most 
readily well-known example is naloxone, commonly used as an intravenous reversal agent in the 
context of opioid over-dosing. Agents that block mu-opioid receptors in the GI tract, but do not enter 
the central nervous system (CNS), are expected to treat OIBD without diminishing central analgesic 
actions. Several opioid antagonists with local action within the gut or (outside the CNS) peripherally-
acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) have become available such as methylnaltrexone, 
naldemedine and naloxegol (Farmer et al., 2019).

EMA/554500/2023 
Page 35/39 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In the initial marketing authorisation application, naloxegol has been demonstrated in randomised, 
double blind phase 3 clinical studies to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of OIC in patients with 
non-cancer pain related OIC. A clinically relevant and statistically significant effect was observed in the 
laxative inadequate subgroup (LIR) of patients. In the non-LIR subgroup, no such effect was observed. 
66% of non-LIR patients had tried laxatives in the past (within 6 months) but had stopped them for 
various reasons.  
Moventig is thus currently indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s). The SmPC specifies how this inadequacy 
of response was established in the clinical studies supporting the therapeutic indication.  
In the current type II variation, the MAH proposes to change the indication as follows: Moventig is 
indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have previously 
been treated with a laxative. The applicant motivated the change in 4.1 stating that the new indication 
better reflects the class recommendation for PAMORAs (De Giorgio, et al., 2021) and how Moventig is 
used in clinical practice.  
No new clinical data have been submitted to support such expansion of the indication to patients with a 
non-documented response to laxatives. Results from the observational studies (see below) MovE, 
NACASY and KYONAL were also generated in a population with a documented inadequate response to 
laxatives.  
In support of the changes proposed in section 4.2 and 4.4, a pooled analysis of safety and efficacy 
data was submitted. This pool comprised clinical data from three observational studies, MovE, NACASY 
and Kyonal. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Non cancer-pain OIC patients were included in the pivotal phase 3 studies for Moventig. At the time of 
the initial marketing authorisation, a trial in this patient population was early terminated because of 
recruitment issues. However, cancer-pain OIC patients are included in the current label since the effect 
of naloxegol was and is not considered to be different in those patients, but a (safety) warning on the 
limited clinical experience in this patient population was included in the SmPC, which the applicant 
wishes to remove in current variation. Data from three observational studies (MovE, NACASY and 
Kyonal) further confirmed that naloxegol is efficacious in a real world setting of OIC treatment in 
cancer-pain related patients.  
The concomitant use of laxatives was not allowed in the pivotal naloxegol studies in non-cancer pain 
OIC studies and a recommendation to halt standard laxatives until the effect of naloxegol is 
determined is currently present in the SmPC. In cancer-pain OIC patients, it is accepted that an add-on 
treatment is investigated, since the origin of constipation in these patients might not solely be due to 
opioid use. Real world data from three observational studies confirmed that naloxegol use 
concomitantly with standard laxatives is efficacious.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the data package submitted, the use of naloxegol in combination with standard laxatives was only 
investigated in observational studies in cancer pain patients, not in patients suffering from OIC induced 
by opioid use for non-cancer pain or in controlled clinical trials. However, it is not expected that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023 
Page 36/39 
 
 
 
 
effect of concomitant laxative use would be different in non-cancer pain patients, also considering that 
naloxegol and standard laxatives have a different mode of action.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Data from three observational studies (MovE, NACASY and Kyonal) demonstrated that naloxegol is safe 
in a real world setting of OIC treatment in cancer-pain patients. The pooled safety population for the 4 
week period that was assessed comprised 427 patients.  
In cancer-pain OIC patients, it is accepted that an add-on treatment is investigated, since the origin of 
constipation in these patients might not solely be due to opioid use. Real world data from the three 
observational studies demonstrated that naloxegol use concomitantly with standard laxatives is safe in 
these patients. Adverse reactions considered related to naloxegol use, per investigator, were 
numerically lower in patients using naloxegol combined with standard laxatives compared to when 
naloxegol was used alone.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The data relevant for the changes with regard to cancer-pain experience and concomitant laxative use 
come from real word studies and not from controlled clinical trials. However, these data mainly serve 
to establish the safety of naloxegol use in both conditions, since the bulk of the clinical efficacy and 
safety data have already been provided in two similar controlled phase 3 studies in patients with OIC 
and non-cancer related pain. It is considered that the real world data are valuable in expanding the 
safety experience in cancer pain OIC patients and in patients taking concomitant standard laxatives.  
The use of naloxegol in combination with standard laxatives was only investigated in observational 
studies in cancer pain patients, not in patients suffering from OIC induced by opioid use for non-cancer 
pain. In cancer pain patients, concomitant use with standard laxatives did not reveal additional safety 
issues related to naloxegol. It is not expected that this would be different in non-cancer pain patients, 
also considering that naloxegol and standard laxatives have a different mode of action.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
No clinical data were submitted in support of the change in therapeutic indication. No favourable or 
unfavourable effects therefore could be identified for the modified indication.  
Clinical experience with naloxegol in cancer pain OIC patients with or without concomitant use of 
standard laxatives confirmed it was efficacious and could be used safely in this patient population. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH proposed to change the approved therapeutic indication as follows: Moventig is indicated for 
the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have previously been treated 
with a laxative, removing the restriction of the indication to laxative inadequate responders.  
The applicant motivated the change in 4.1 stating that the new indication better reflects the class 
recommendation for PAMORAs (De Giorgio, et al., 2021) and the way Moventig is used in clinical 
practice. The original Moventig data only supported a positive B/R in an OIC population with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/554500/2023 
Page 37/39 
 
 
 
 
documented inadequate response to laxatives, and not in the population where such inadequate 
response was not documented, even though many of the latter patients had used a standard laxative 
before at some point. Results from the observational studies MovE, NACASY and KYONAL were also 
generated in a population with a documented inadequate response to laxatives. No new clinical data 
were submitted to support the expansion of the indication to patients with a non-documented response 
to laxatives.  
In the absence of new evidence, the proposed change in the wording of the therapeutic indication was 
not considered acceptable by the CHMP. The MAH withdrew the change to the indication in the course 
of the procedure and the therapeutic indication will therefore remain limited to patients with a 
documented inadequate response to laxatives. 
Data from the individual observational studies and the analysis of pooled data confirmed the efficacy of 
naloxegol in the treatment of OIC in cancer pain patients, with or without concomitant laxatives. Since 
the bulk of efficacy data for naloxegol had been generated in controlled clinical trials, and a similar 
effect was expected in cancer pain patients, the expansion of clinical experience in cancer pain patients 
with data from observational studies is acceptable, since they only serve to further support an already 
granted indication. Accordingly, the applied changes to 4.2 (Moventig may be used with or without 
laxatives) and 4.4 (deletion of precautionary statement in OIC patients with cancer) are considered 
acceptable. Furthermore, the removal of Safety in Patients with Cancer Pain as Missing information in 
the RMP and editorial changes to the product information were agreed with by the committee.  
The applicant applied to include data from supporting observational studies Kyonal, NACASY and MovE 
into 5.1 of the SmPC. However, the CHMP did not agree with this approach taking into consideration 
the SmPC guideline stating that “It may be appropriate to provide limited information, relevant to the 
prescriber, such as the main results (statistically compelling and clinically relevant) regarding pre-
specified end points or clinical outcomes in the major trials and giving the main characteristics of the 
patient population. Such information on clinical trials should be concise, clear, relevant and balanced, 
and should summarize evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication.” As a consequence, 
the MAH withdrew their claim to update 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The CHMP, whilst agreeing on the supporting evidence for the changes in 4.2 and 4,4. as outlined in 
this report disagreed to include this RWE into 5.1 of the SmPC. The MAH agreed with this approach. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

3.7.  Conclusions 
The MAH submitted a variation application under category C.1.6.a of the variation classification 
Guideline with the scope to “Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for relugolix, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on urticaria and angioedema from spontaneous reports including cases with a 
close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible 
mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between relugolix and urticaria and 
angioedema is at least a reasonable possibility and concluded that the product information of products 
containing relugolix should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for relugolix the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing relugolix is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

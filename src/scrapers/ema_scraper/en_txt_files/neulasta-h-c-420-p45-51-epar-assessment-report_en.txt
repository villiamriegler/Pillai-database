INTRODUCTION 
On 13 February 2008, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric study for Neulasta / Neupopeg 
(pegfilgrastim), in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on 
medicinal products for paediatric use. 
The clinical expert statement included in the renewal application in April 2007 briefly mentioned that a 
phase 2 paediatric clinical study data should be submitted as soon as it is available. 
On 24 July 2008, the CHMP requested additional clarifications, which were submitted by the MAH in 
November 2008. 
In addition, on 03 October 2008, the MAH also submitted the publication of an investigator-sponsored 
paediatric study (Wendelin at al, 2005). 
No expert overview and no additional documentation were provided.  The MAH did not propose any 
consequential regulatory action. 
This assessment report relates to both submissions. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical studies 
Neulasta and Neupopeg are brand names for pegfilgrastim presented as 6mg/0.6ml solution for 
injection (10mg/ml) in either a pre-filled syringe or a pre-filled pen.  Pegfilgrastim is a covalent 
conjugate of recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 
monomethoxypolyethylene glycol that regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils 
from bone marrow.  
There are no paediatric formulations for filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.  For the trial, pegfilgrastim was 
packaged as single-use vials containing a 10mg/ml solution and filgrastim as single-use vials 
containing a 3mg/ml solution.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Pegfilgrastim is indicated for the reduction of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in 
patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid 
leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
Until the presented study was undertaken, pegfilgrastim, with the decreased number of injections, was 
not available to paediatric patients. This study was designed to determine whether a single dose of 
pegfilgrastim per chemotherapy cycle was as effective and safe as daily filgrastim in paediatric subjects 
with sarcoma who were receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy and to establish the appropriate 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 45 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

pegfilgrastim dose for the reduction of severe neutropenia in paediatric subjects. The clinical 
hypothesis of this study was that a single dose of pegfilgrastim per chemotherapy cycle in paediatric 
subjects with sarcoma who were receiving VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy would result in a duration of 
severe neutropenia, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery profile, and safety profile similar to that 
observed with daily administration of filgrastim.  
The MAH submitted one report for Study 990130: A study of single-dose-per-cycle filgrastim-SD/01 as 
an adjunct to VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy in paediatric sarcoma patients.  The study was performed by 
Amgen in the United States and Australia. 
Clinical study 
Description 
This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study, in which paediatric subjects with sarcoma were 
randomized in a 6:1 allocation to receive either a single dose of pegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg or daily doses 
of filgrastim 5 μg/kg after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. 
The study was divided into 2 parts. In part 1 of the study, 3 subjects were enrolled to receive 100 
μg/kg pegfilgrastim to evaluate the safety of this dose in paediatric subjects. After establishing an 
acceptable safety profile in these 3 subjects, part 2 of the study was initiated. In part 2, an additional 
18 subjects were randomized and stratified into each of 3 age groups (0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 
years) in the first dose cohort. 
Methods 
Objectives: 
Primary 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the ANC profile after myelosuppressive

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Forty-four subjects were enrolled (n = 38 pegfilgrastim, 6 filgrastim) at 10 study centres in the United 
States and Australia. All but 1 subject received at least 1 dose of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim (37 
pegfilgrastim, 6 filgrastim). 
Thirteen subjects (12 pegfilgrastim, 1 filgrastim) were enrolled in the 0- to 5-year age group, 12 
subjects (10 pegfilgrastim, 2 filgrastim) in the 6- to 11-year group, and 19 subjects (16 pegfilgrastim, 
3 filgrastim) in the 12- to 21-year group. 
All subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product were included in safety and efficacy 
analyses (37 pegfilgrastim, 6 filgrastim). 
Sixty-three per cent of subjects in the pegfilgrastim group and 83% of subjects in the filgrastim group 
had 1 or more important protocol deviations. By subject incidence, the most common type of 
important protocol deviation was missing ANC, antibody, or pharmacokinetic data (55% pegfilgrastim, 
50% filgrastim), followed by missed dose of investigational product (8% pegfilgrastim, 17% 
filgrastim), off-schedule study procedure (5% pegfilgrastim, 17% filgrastim), and eligibility violation 
(3% pegfilgrastim, 17% filgrastim).

Baseline data 
The mean age was 9.8 years (SD 5.7 years) in the pegfilgrastim group and 10.8 years (SD 5.1 years) 
in the filgrastim group. In the pegfilgrastim group, 68% of subjects (28 boys) were male and 32% 
were female (16 girls). 
In the filgrastim group, 33% of subjects were male and 67% were female. Most subjects in both 
treatment groups were white (79% pegfilgrastim, 83% filgrastim). Mean ANC at baseline was similar in 
the pegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups (5.018 x 109/L and 4.832 x 109/L, respectively).

CHMP comment 
Number of studied patients is small and even smaller in each age subgroups. 
Efficacy results 
No consistent differences in the efficacy profile were observed between treatment groups. 
In the first cycle of chemotherapy, the mean duration of severe neutropenia was 6.0 days in the 
pegfilgrastim group and 5.3 days in the filgrastim group, a difference that was neither clinically nor 
statistically significant.  
Among subjects who received pegfilgrastim, the mean duration of severe neutropenia in cycle 1 was 
slightly longer in the younger age groups: 8.9, 6.0, and 3.7 days for subjects in the age groups of 0 to 
5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, respectively.  
In the third cycle of chemotherapy, the mean duration of severe neutropenia was 8.1 days in the 
pegfilgrastim group and 5.8 days in the filgrastim group. For the protocol-specified age groups of 0 to 
5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the mean duration of severe neutropenia was 11.4, 9.0, and 4.7 days, 
respectively, for subjects who received pegfilgrastim. 
The subject incidence of febrile neutropenia during cycle-1 chemotherapy was 57% in the 
pegfilgrastim group and 83% in the filgrastim group.

In the protocol-specified age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the incidence of cycle-1 
febrile neutropenia was 75%, 70%, and 33%, respectively, for subjects who received pegfilgrastim, 
and 100%, 50%, and 100%, respectively, for subjects who received filgrastim. The incidence of febrile 
neutropenia during cycle-3 chemotherapy was 44% in the pegfilgrastim group and 75% in the 
filgrastim group. In the age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the incidence of cycle-3 
febrile neutropenia was 64%, 40%, and 31%, respectively, for subjects who received pegfilgrastim, 
and 100%, 100%, and 50%, respectively, for subjects who received filgrastim. 
The median time to ANC recovery during the first cycle of chemotherapy was 14 days in both 
treatment groups. In the protocol-specified age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the 
median times to ANC recovery were 15, 14, and 13 days, respectively, for subjects who received 
pegfilgrastim, and 16, 15, and 14 days, respectively, for subjects who received filgrastim.  
In the third cycle of chemotherapy, the median time to ANC recovery was 14 days in the pegfilgrastim 
group and 15 days in the filgrastim group. In the age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the 
median times to ANC recovery were 17 days, 14 days, and 13 days, respectively, for subjects in the 
pegfilgrastim group, and 15, 17, and 15 days, respectively, for subjects in the filgrastim group.

CHMP comment: 
The primary objective was to assess the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) profile after 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy followed by single-dose administration of pegfilgrastim or daily 
filgrastim in paediatric subjects with sarcoma.  
The mean (SD) duration of severe neutropenia was 6.0 (3.9) days in the pegfilgrastim group and 5.3 
(3.1) days in the filgrastim group, a difference was neither clinically nor statistically significant. The 
mean duration of severe neutropenia in cycle-1 chemotherapy was longer in the younger age groups. 
In cycle one the median duration of severe neutropenia was 3.5 days in the filgrastim arm and 6.0 
days in the pegfilgrastim arm for the 6 to 11 years age group. But the number of subjects in the age 
group 6 to 11 years is small (2 subjects) in the filgrastim arm. Severe neutropenia seems to last 
longer in children compared to the pivotal study results in adults. The applicant is asked to comment. 
Febrile neutropenia was also more frequent in pegfilgrastim arm (70%) compared to filgrastim arm 
(50%) in the same age group, but again the numbers are too small (one subject in the filgrastim arm) 
to draw definitive conclusions.

Incidence of febrile neutropenia in cycle 3 was more frequent in the filgrastim group in all age groups. 
Overall the incidence of febrile neutropenia was more common in the children compared to the results 
from earlier studies with adults. The applicant should comment on the difference between children and 
adults. 
For all subjects in the efficacy set the median duration of severe neutropenia was 5.0 days in the 
pegfilgrastim group and 6.0 days in the filgrastim group in cycle one. 
In the age group of younger children, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was more common 
compared to older children and adults in earlier studies. Also, duration of severe neutropenia was 
longer. 
As the results might be dose-dependent in children, the CHMP recommends studying further the dose 
in children. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Pharmacokinetic data were available for 36 subjects who received pegfilgrastim and 6 subjects who 
received filgrastim. 
The maximum pegfilgrastim concentration was achieved approximately 24 hours postdose and was 
sustained until the ANC nadir occurred. As the ANC began to recover, the pegfilgrastim concentration 
declined rapidly.  
During cycle 3, median exposures were lower than those in cycle 1 for each age group, potentially as a 
result of the expansion of neutrophils and neutrophils precursor mass with time. These observations 
are consistent with neutrophil-mediated clearance.  
The pharmacokinetic profile was similar in the 2 older age groups and consistent with that in adults; 
the youngest age group appeared to have higher median exposure. The applicant presumes that the 
tendency toward a higher median exposure in the youngest age group may relate to the fact that these 
subjects had more severe neutropenia with a deeper ANC nadir and a longer duration of neutropenia, 
consistent with a neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism. 
Compared with the serum pegfilgrastim concentration profile, the median serum filgrastim 
concentration declined rapidly after the first dose. After repeated administration, the daily trough 
filgrastim concentration increased until the ANC nadir occurred and then decreased thereafter. 
CHMP comment:  
The youngest age group appeared to have higher median exposure. The company should be aware of 
the draft Guideline on the Role of Pharmacokinetics in the Development of Medicinal Products in the 
Paediatric Population 
Safety results 
Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim were well tolerated in the paediatric subjects enrolled in this study, with no 
consistent differences in the safety profiles observed between the treatment groups or across the 
protocol-specified age groups. The overall adverse event profile was generally consistent with the 
known effects and complications of cancer and its treatment. All subjects had 1 or more adverse 
events while on study.

Consistent with expectations for paediatric subjects with sarcoma who were receiving 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy, serious adverse events were relatively common, reported for 78% of 
subjects in the pegfilgrastim group and 83% of subjects in the filgrastim group. In the protocol-
specified age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the incidence of serious adverse events 
was 92%, 80%, and 67%, respectively, in the pegfilgrastim group and 100%, 50%, and 100%, 
respectively, in the filgrastim group. The incidence of serious adverse events was somewhat higher in 
the youngest age group (0 to 5 years) (92% pegfilgrastim, 100% filgrastim) than in the older age 
groups. This difference resulted primarily from a higher incidence of serious febrile neutropenia in the 
youngest age group (75% pegfilgrastim, 100% filgrastim), and it is not thought to be a treatment-
related effect of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. 
It should be noted that the 0- to 5-year age group included only 1 subject who received filgrastim. 
Most subjects (84% pegfilgrastim, 83% filgrastim) had 1 or more adverse events that were severe, life 
threatening, or fatal. Of these events, 1 was fatal (respiratory acidosis in a subject who received 
pegfilgrastim). One subject (3%) in the pegfilgrastim group withdrew because of an adverse event 
(disease progression). 
Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with the known effects of pegfilgrastim and 
filgrastim and were reported for 22% of subjects who received pegfilgrastim and 33% of subjects who 
received filgrastim. Bone pain was the most common treatment-related adverse event (11% 
pegfilgrastim, 17% filgrastim). Treatment-related adverse events were primarily mild or moderate in 
severity. One subject in the pegfilgrastim group had serious adverse events (tachycardia, Clostridium 
difficile colitis, abdominal distension, and tachypnoea) that were considered by the investigator to be 
related to treatment. 
No consistent differences were noted across the treatment or age groups in laboratory results. 
Ten of 41 subjects (24%) tested positive for pre-existing antibodies against filgrastim or pegfilgrastim; 
5 of these subjects were also positive for neutralizing antibodies to pegfilgrastim in the baseline 
sample. One subject (2%) developed transient postdose antibodies against filgrastim at a single time 
point after receiving pegfilgrastim. No consistent effects of the antibodies were noted in the clinical or 
pharmacokinetic profiles for these subjects.

Deaths 
One subject (3%) who received pegfilgrastim died while on study (ie, within 30 days of the last dose of 
investigational product). 
The investigator reported the cause of death as renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis and 
worsening respiratory acidosis. 
Withdrawals Due to Adverse Events 
One withdrawal due to an adverse event of disease progression was reported for a subject who 
received pegfilgrastim 
Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events were reported for 29 subjects (78%) who received pegfilgrastim and 5 subjects 
(83%) who received filgrastim. Serious adverse events reported for > 2 subjects in either treatment 
group were the following (pegfilgrastim, filgrastim): febrile neutropenia (24 subjects [65%], 5 subjects 
[83%]), dehydration (4 subjects [11%], 1 subject [17%]), neutropenia (0 subjects, 4 subjects 
[11%]), mucosal inflammation (3 subjects [8%], 0 subjects), vomiting (3 subjects [8%], 0 subjects), 
pyrexia (3 subjects [8%], 1 subject [17%]), and catheter-related infection (3 subjects [8%], 0 
subjects). 
Within the protocol-specified age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the incidence of serious 
adverse events was 92%, 80%, and 67%, respectively, in the pegfilgrastim group and 100%, 50%, 
and 100%, respectively, in the filgrastim group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 
somewhat higher in the youngest age group (0 to 5 years) (92% pegfilgrastim, 100% filgrastim); 
however, this difference should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of subjects in 
the age groups. The primary difference in serious adverse events in the 0- to 5-year age group 
occurred in the incidence of serious febrile neutropenia (75% pegfilgrastim, 100% filgrastim); the

other serious adverse events reported for this age group were also associated with the effects and 
complications of cancer and its treatment. 
One subject had serious adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to treatment with 
pegfilgrastim. No subject withdrew from treatment or the study because of a serious adverse event.

CHMP comment 
Anaemia, nausea, rash, pain, fatigue etc. seem to be more frequent in the pegfilgrastim group 
compared to filgrastim group, but the number of patients in the filgrastim group is too small to draw 
comparisons between the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim groups.  
The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the youngest age group (0 to 5 years) (92% 
pegfilgrastim) compared to other age groups (80% in the age 6-11 and 67% in the age 12-21). 
The safety profile is overall as expected from the adult studies; however the events were more 
frequent. The frequency of events might be dose-dependent, especially in younger children. It is 
recommended to carry further dose finding studies in paediatric population. 
Treatment-related Adverse Events 
Adverse events attributed by the investigators to treatment with investigational product were reported 
for 22% of subjects in the pegfilgrastim group and 33% of subjects in the filgrastim group. The only 
treatment-related adverse event reported for > 1 subject was bone pain, reported for 11% of subjects 
in the pegfilgrastim group and 17% of subjects in the filgrastim group. In the protocol-specified age 
groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 
25%, 50%, and 0%, respectively, for subjects who received pegfilgrastim and 0%, 50%, and 33%, 
respectively, for subjects who received filgrastim. With the exception of severe Clostridium difficile and

tachypnoea reported for a subject who received pegfilgrastim, all treatment-related events were mild 
to moderate in severity. 
Antibodies 
The incidence of postdose antibody development was 2% (1 of 41 subjects with available samples); 1 
subject developed transient postdose antibodies to filgrastim at a single time point after receiving 
pegfilgrastim. Ten subjects (10 of 41, 24%) had pre-existing binding antibodies to pegfilgrastim, 
filgrastim, or both, and 5 (5 of 41, 12%) of these subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies to 
pegfilgrastim at baseline. All 10 subjects tested negative after receiving investigational product. It is 
unknown whether the increased incidence of pre-existing antibodies observed in this study relates to 
the underlying diagnosis of sarcoma in these subjects or to the more diverse immune repertoire of the 
paediatric population. A review of data for the subjects with pre-existing antibodies and single subject 
with transient postdose antibodies did not reveal an altered safety profile in these subjects. 
CHMP comment:  
One (of 41) subject developed transient postdose antibodies to filgrastim. The number of studies 
subjects is too small to show the real frequency. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted the clinical study report of study 990130 as part of the obligation to submit 
paediatric data to the CHMP.  
The overall mean duration of severe neutropenia in cycle 1 was 6.0 days in the pegfilgrastim group 
and 5.3 days in the filgrastim group (consistent with previous data), a difference between treatment 
groups that was neither clinically nor statistically significant. The mean duration of severe neutropenia 
in cycle-1 chemotherapy tended to be longer in the younger age groups: 8.9, 6.0, and 3.7 days for 
subjects who received pegfilgrastim in the age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 years, 
respectively. 
Severe neutropenia in cycle 3 was reported for 97% of subjects in the pegfilgrastim group and 75% of 
subjects in the filgrastim group, with a mean duration of 8.1 days in the pegfilgrastim group and 5.8 
days in the filgrastim group. For the protocol-specified age groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 21 
years, the mean duration of severe neutropenia was 11.4, 9.0, and 4.7 days, respectively, among 
subjects who received pegfilgrastim. 
The pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim was generally consistent with that in adults. The neutrophil-
mediated clearance mechanism previously observed in adults was evident in this study, including in 
the youngest subjects (0 to 5 years of age). The maximum pegfilgrastim concentration was achieved 
at approximately 24 hours postdose and was sustained until the ANC nadir occurred. As ANC started to 
recover, the pegfilgrastim concentration declined rapidly. 
The pharmacokinetic profile was similar in the 2 older age groups and consistent with that in adults; 
the youngest age group appeared to have higher median exposure. 
The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known effects of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim 
and the complications of cancer and its treatment.

Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
Overall pegfilgrastim seems to have similar efficacy and safety to filgrastim; however the number of 
subjects in each age group was too small to robustly compare filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. No new 
safety trends or concerns emerged from this review. The types of reported events are consistent with 
what has been observed in adults.  
The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the youngest age group (0 to 5 years) (92% 
pegfilgrastim) compared to other age groups (80% in the age group 6-11 and 67% in the age group 
12-21). 
The obligation to submit paediatric data for Neupogen/Neulasta is fulfilled for the current submission, 
however the CHMP recommends studying further the adequate dose for paediatric population as the 
incidence of serious adverse events was higher, the duration of severe neutropenia was longer and the 
frequency of serious adverse events more common in the younger children compared to older age 
groups and to results from adult studies 
Recommendation 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications as part of this procedure 
P45 (see section IV “Additional clarifications requested”).

Assessment of the responses to the request for additional 
clarifications 
Question Nr. 1 
As the first years of life is associated with major changes in the processes affecting the 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs, the applicant is asked to 
present efficacy and pharmacokinetic results for the first years of life (years 0-5 should be 
divided) as classified in the ICH and CPMP guidelines (Guideline on the Role of 
Pharmacokinetic in the Development of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population): 
preterm newborn infants, term newborn infants (0 – 27 days), infants and toddlers (28 days 
– 23 month), children (2 – 5 years in this study).  
MAH’s response 
Within the 0-5 year age category, 13 subjects were enrolled, 12 were randomized to the pegfilgrastim 
arm and 1 subject was randomized to the Filgrastim arm.  In this study, no subjects were enrolled in 
the first two age categories (preterm newborn infants or term newborn infants).

The statistical analysis plan prespecified analyses by three age categories, 0-5 years, 6-11 years, and 
12-21 years.  Individual efficacy and PK data are presented for each individual subject within the 0-5 
age category.  Due to the small numbers of subjects in each of the subgroups within the 0-5 year age 
category, summary statistics were not calculated.  PK data were not collected for one subject, 713401 
who was in the 28 days - 23 months age category. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH briefly presented individual efficacy and PK data for all enrolled patients in the 0-5 years age 
category. PK data for one enrolled patient was not presented due to non-collection of such data during 
this study.  
In general, the duration of severe neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia were greater in 
cycles 1 and 3, as these cycles were associated with administration of more myelotoxic chemotherapy 
regimes than cycles 2 and 4.   
For both duration of severe neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia, there was little evidence 
or suggestion of a difference between the two subgroups; infants and toddlers (28 days – 23 months) 
and  children (2-5 years) (No patients were enrolled in younger age categories). However, the small 
patient numbers preclude any conclusion that infants and toddlers do not have a higher incidence of 
febrile neutropenia or duration of severe neutropenia than children aged 2-5 years.

PK data for the two subgroups described the same phenomenon demonstrated in the adult studies 
where improvements in ANC were accompanied by falls in the serum pegfilgrastim concentration, 
reflecting increasing neutrophil mediated uptake of pegfilgrastim. 
The limited efficacy and PK data presented on the small number of patients within the (28 days – 23 
months) and (2-5 years) subgroups do not demonstrate increased duration of severe neutropenia and 
incidence of febrile neutropenia in infants compared to children. However, the small patient numbers 
preclude any conclusions being drawn from these data. 
Point resolved 
Question Nr. 2 
Overall the incidence of febrile neutropenia was more common in the children compared to 
the results from earlier studies with adults. The applicant should comment the difference in 
results between children and adults. 
MAH’s response 
Incidence of febrile neutropenia is directly proportional to the duration of severe neutropenia resulting 
from the myelotoxicity of the regimen, disease involvement of the bone marrow compartment, and 
specific patient-related factors (such as co-morbidities, previous anti-cancer therapy, organ function-
including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs, and use of growth factor).  The 
study chemotherapy, VAdriaC/IE (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and 
ifosfamide), is a long-accepted and widely-utilized treatment for paediatric sarcoma.  The regimen 
however, is associated with significant myelotoxicity with a median duration of severe neutropenia of 9 
days without growth factor (Wexler et al, 1996) requiring treatment dose-delays and dose-reductions.  
In curative-setting treatment protocols, maintenance of dose intensity is an important factor in 
treatment outcome (Smith et al, 1991).  Therefore, Filgrastim has often been incorporated in the 
administration of dose-intensive VAdriaC/IE with a reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia by 
approximately 3-4 days (Unpublished data, POB/NCI/NIH). Considering the study chemotherapy 
regimen, the desired dose-intensity of administration and the age-specific patient characteristics, the 
duration of severe neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia in both the Filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim treated subjects is as expected.  
The rate of febrile neutropenia in this study was 54% in cycle 1 and 42% in cycle 3 (cycles 2 and 4 
incorporated less myelotoxic chemotherapy administration).  A higher rate of febrile neutropenia was 
concentrated in the 0-5 and 6-11 year age categories, where less mature drug metabolism and 
excretion would be expected to translate into an increased duration of severe neutropenia and 
accordingly, an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia  
While the incidence of febrile neutropenia in this paediatric study is higher than in a number of earlier 
studies in adult populations, this is due to the chemotherapy regimens employed and the differing 
degrees of myelosuppression.  A comparison of these data with the pivotal phase III study of 
Filgrastim in adults reveals a similar rate of febrile neutropenia: the Filgrastim study, in adult small cell 
lung cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide, reported a febrile 
neutropenia rate with Filgrastim support of 40% across all cycles (Crawford et al, 1991).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The point raised by the MAH concerning the significant myelotoxicity associated with VAdriaC/IE 
therapy is acknowledged   
The overall rate of febrile neutropenia in patients administered pegfilgrastim in the submitted study 
report was 57% in cycle 1 and 44% in cycle 3, not 54% and 42% quoted in the MAH’s response.  
The MAH acknowledges that a higher rate of febrile neutropenia was seen in patients in the 0-5 years 
and 6-11 years categories; however, attributes this age related rate difference to less effective 
cytotoxic drug clearance by the younger patients, resulting in greater levels of immunosupression. 
Whilst this appears to be a logical explanation, the MAH did not provide any references or other 
information to support its assertion.  
The MAH also attributes the rate differences seen between this study and the adult studies to the 
different chemotherapeutic regimens used. To illustrate this assertion the MAH highlights similar rates 
(40% across all cycles (Crawford et al)) of febrile neutropenia in adult small cell lung cancer patients 
who participated in a phase III study of filgrastim and received similarly myelosuppressive 
chemotherapy.  
Whatever the aetiology of the higher rates of febrile neutropenias seen in patients in this study 
compared to adult patients enrolled in earlier studies of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, it is important 
that both prescribers and patients are made aware of the data from this study to help inform 
treatment decisions and choices for paediatric patients for whom treatment with pegfilgrastim is being 
considered.  
Therefore, the MAH is invited to submit a type II variation to update various sections of the SmPC with 
safety and efficacy data from this study  
Point resolved subject to submission of the requested variation  
Question Nr. 3 
Severe neutropenia seems to last longer in children compared to the pivotal study results in 
adults. The applicant is asked to comment. 
MAH’s response 
As shown below, the duration of severe neutropenia in this study is consistent with that observed in 
other paediatric studies using VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy with growth factor support.   
The duration of severe neutropenia observed in this study is also consistent with that observed in two 
pivotal studies of Filgrastim.  In these studies, patients with small cell lung cancer received 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide with or without G-CSF support.  Those randomised to 
the Filgrastim group experienced a median duration of severe neutropenia across all cycles of 6 days 
(Trillet-Lenoir et al, 1993; Crawford et al., 1991).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The point raised by the MAH concerning the duration of severe neutropenia associated with VAdriaC/IE 
therapy + growth factor support in other paediatric studies and in the adult pivotal studies of filgrastim 
is acknowledged.  
However, it is noted that for patients allocated to the pegfilgrastim cohort within this study, the mean 
duration of severe neutropenia appears longest  in the youngest age category, with a trend towards 
decreasing duration of severe neutropenia with increasing age: 8.9, 6.0 and 3.7 days for patents in the 
following respective subgroups; 0-5, 6-11 and 12-21 years.  
Regardless of the aetiology, it is important that both prescribers and patients are made aware of the 
data from this study to help inform treatment decisions and choices for paediatric patients for whom 
treatment with pegfilgrastim is being considered. 
Therefore, the MAH is invited to submit a type II variation to update various sections of the SmPC with 
safety and efficacy data from this study

Question Nr. 4 
The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the youngest age group (0 to 5 years) 
(92% pegfilgrastim) compared to other age groups (80% in the age 6-11 and 67% in the 
age 12-21). The applicant should present the safety results of age group 0-5 years old more 
detailed in age groups (0 – 27 days), infants and toddlers (28 days – 23 month), children (2 
– 5 years). 
MAH’s response 
As stated in the response to question 1, within the 0-5 year age category, 13 subjects were enrolled, 
12 were randomized to the pegfilgrastim arm and 1 subject was randomized to the Filgrastim arm.  Of 
these, 4 subjects were in the 28 day to 23 month age category (all pegfilgrastim), and 9 were in the 2-
5 year age category (8 pegfilgrastim, 1 Filgrastim); no subjects were enrolled in the first two age 
categories (preterm newborn infants or term newborn infants).   
Considering the pegfilgrastim group alone, serious adverse events occurred in a total of 11 subjects.  
The most common serious adverse event for both age categories was febrile neutropenia.

Individual data are presented for all 12 subjects (11 pegfilgrastim and 1 Filgrastim). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH presented SAE data for individual patients within the pre-defined groups, as requested. The 
majority of SAEs were febrile neutropenias and other serious infections, which occurred more 
frequently in the 0-5 years age category than in other age groups. The points made earlier by the MAH 
regarding the increased susceptibility of this sub group to infections in this respect are acknowledged.  
The incidence of non-infectious SAEs did not appear to be increased in the 0-5 years subgroup 
compared to older children enrolled in the study. However, the small patient numbers and the small 
number of non-infectious SAEs recorded preclude any conclusions being drawn

Once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim versus daily filgrastim in paediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma. 
Wendelin, G. et al. 
Journal of Paediatric Hematology/Oncology. 2005;27(8):449 5 
Method 
The study was conducted from September 2003 to September 2005 in one single centre in Germany. 
Five male patients, aged 10-15 years, received cytotoxic chemotherapy for Ewing sarcoma.  It 
consisted of 6 preoperative induction cycles of VIDE (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, etoposide) 
and/or postoperative cycles of either VAI (vincristine, actinomycin D, ifosfamide) or VAC (vincristine, 
actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide).  They were alternatively treated with a single subcutaneous 100 
µg/kg pegfilgrastim dose on day 4 after chemotherapy and with daily subcutaneous doses of 10 µg/kg 
filgrastim starting on day 4 after chemotherapy until an absolute neutrophil count above 1 x 109/L 
after the chemotherapy-induced nadir was reached. 
A sixth female patient was withdrawn after the 4th preoperative cycle due to life-threatening 
neutropenia lasting more than 10 days while on filgrastim; she was subsequently switched to 
continuous 24-hour intravenous infusion of rhG-CSF. 
Overall, 29 cycles with each treatment were studied (see table below). 
Results 
The duration of severe neutropenia, the incidence and duration of febrile neutropenia were comparable 
with both treatments (see table below). 
Bone pain associated with pegfilgrastim was noted in one patient after one cycle.  No other adverse 
effects were attributed to the use of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim.  Maximum leukocyte counts, platelet 
and red blood cell (RBC) recovery and the need for platelet and RBC transfusions were similar.

CHMP comment:  
Although limited to 5 children, these results suggest comparable efficacy between one injection of 100 
µg/kg pegfilgrastim and a course of filgrastim administered at twice the dose usually recommended. 
CHMP’s Overall Conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH has provided the requested information regarding Study 990130 and the issues are 
considered resolved subject to submission of the requested variation. It is acknowledged that such a 
paediatric trial is difficult to conduct for all the reasons noted by the MAH. The enrolment of 4 infants 
and 9 children less than 6 years old is itself considered to be of significant value. Further, the MAH has 
indicated that it would not be feasible to “initiate further study (of pegfilgrastim) in the paediatric 
population”. This is considered reasonable and acceptable at present 
Although limited, the information generated by this trial and by the publication of a cross-over trial 
supports the use of pegfilgrastim as an alternative to filgrastim in children treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  However, the results suggest that the outcomes in infants and young children (less 
than 6 years old) are slightly inferior to those observed in older children, which is likely to be due to 
their higher sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Simultaneously, higher serum levels of 
pegfilgrastim are measured, a finding consistent with its receptor mediated clearance. 
Based on the data provided, the CHMP considers the obligation fulfilled but recommends that a type II 
variation should be submitted by the MAH within 3 months in order to update the SmPC. 
Recommendation 
The CHMP recommends the update of various sections of the SmPC with safety and efficacy data from 
the paediatric study within 3 months

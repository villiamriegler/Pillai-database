CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX 
deficiency).
RIXUBIS is indicated in patients of all age groups.
2
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Treatment monitoring
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity plasma level has been attained, careful monitoring using 
an appropriate factor IX activity assay is advised and, if necessary, appropriate adjustments to the dose 
and the frequency of repeated infusions should be performed. When using an in vitro thromboplastin 
time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients’ blood 
samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT 
reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing 
the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.
Posology
Dose and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on 
the location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient’s clinical condition, age and 
pharmacokinetic parameters of factor IX, such as incremental recovery and half-life.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed 
either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an 
International Standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit  of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of 
normal human plasma.
Adult population
On demand treatment:
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit  factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.9 IU/dL (range 
from 0.5 to 1.4 IU/dL) or 0.9% of normal activity in patients 12 years and older (further information 
see section 5.2).
The required dose is determined using the following formula:
Required 
units
=
body weight (kg)
x
desired factor IX rise
(%) or (IU/dL)
x
reciprocal of observed 
recovery (dL/kg)
For an incremental recovery of 0.9 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
Required 
units
=

x

The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
3
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved.
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved.
Minor surgery including tooth 
extraction
Major surgery
80 – 100
(pre- and postoperative)
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor IX activity of 30% 
to 60% (IU/dl).
Careful monitoring of replacement therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or 
life-threatening haemorrhages.
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses 
are 40 to 60 IU of factor IX per kilogram of body weight at intervals of 3 to 4 days for 
patients 12 years and older. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, 
age, bleeding phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be 
necessary.
Continuous infusion
Do not administer RIXUBIS by continuous infusion.
Paediatric population
Patients aged 12 to 17 years of age:
Posology is the same in adults and paediatric population from 12 to 17.
Patients less than 12 years of age:
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.7 IU/dL (range 
from 0.31 to 1.0 IU/dL) or 0.7% of normal activity in patients less than 12 years of age (further 
information see section 5.2).

The same table as for adults can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery (see above).
Prophylaxis
The recommended dose range for paediatric patients less than 12 years is 40 to 80 IU/kg at intervals 
of 3 to 4 days. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, age, bleeding 
phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Method of administration
Intravenous use.
In case of self-administration or administration by a caregiver appropriate training is needed.
RIXUBIS should be administered using a rate that ensures the comfort of the patient, up to 
a maximum of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.8 to 7.2. The osmolality is greater than 240 m osmol/kg.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
Only plastic luer-lock syringes should be used with this product.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Known allergic reaction to hamster protein.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with RIXUBIS. The product contains 
traces of hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients or their caregivers should 
be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
The risk is highest during the early phases of initial exposure to factor IX concentrates in previously 
untreated patients (PUPs), in particular in patients with high-risk gene mutations. There have been 
reports in the literature showing an association between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and 
allergic reactions, in particular in patients with a high-risk gene mutation. Therefore, patients 
experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
5
Inhibitors
After repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products, patients should be 
monitored for the development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in 
Bethesda Units (BU) using appropriate biological testing.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated 
for the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an 
increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of 
factor IX should, according to the treating physician’s judgement, be performed under medical 
observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Nephrotic syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in 
haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors.
Thromboembolism
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of 
thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when 
administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born 
infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit 
of treatment with RIXUBIS should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
Cardiovascular events
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the 
cardiovascular risk.
Catheter-related complications
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. Depending on body weight and Posology of RIXUBIS, patients could receive more than one 
vial. This should be taken into consideration if the patient is on a controlled sodium diet.
Elderly
Clinical studies of RIXUBIS did not include subjects aged 65 and over. It is not known whether they 
respond differently from younger subjects. As for all patients, dose selection for an elderly patient 
should be individualised.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
been reported.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of Factor IX in pregnant women. Animal 
reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
6
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether Factor IX/metabolites are excreted in human milk.
Fertility
There is no information on the effects of factor IX on fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
RIXUBIS has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these 
reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association 
with development of factor IX inhibitors (see also 4.4).
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in 
haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has 
been observed.
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such 
inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it 
is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX 
products, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has 
been associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with 
such adverse reactions.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Clinical studies with RIXUBIS included 99 subjects with at least one exposure to RIXUBIS reporting 
in total 5 adverse reactions. The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ 
classification (SOC and Preferred Term Level).
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (1/10), 
common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions have been manifested by dyspnoea, pruritus, generalised urticaria and rash.
Paediatric population
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. 
However, no data are available on previously untreated patients as only previously treated patients 
have been enrolled in the clinical studies; no immunogenicity investigation on inhibitor development 
was therefore made in this at risk population.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
The effects of higher than recommended doses of RIXUBIS have not been characterised.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX. ATC code: B02BD04.
Mechanism of action
RIXUBIS contains recombinant coagulation factor IX (nonacog gamma). Factor IX is a single chain 
glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 68,000 Dalton. It is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation 
factor and it is synthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation 
pathway and by factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway. Activated factor IX, in 
combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin 
into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is formed.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously 
or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is 
increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the 
bleeding tendencies.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Prophylaxis and control of bleeding in previously treated patients 12 years and older
The efficacy of RIXUBIS has been evaluated in the open-label, uncontrolled part of a combined 
phase 1/3 study, in which a total of 73 male, previously treated patients (PTPs) 
between 12 and 59 years of age received RIXUBIS either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of 
bleeding episodes on an on-demand basis. All subjects had severe (factor IX level <1%) or moderately 
severe (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. Fifty-nine PTPs received RIXUBIS for prophylaxis. 
Fifty-six of these PTPs who received RIXUBIS for a minimum of 3 months were included in the 
efficacy evaluation for prophylaxis. An additional 14 PTPs received RIXUBIS for the treatment of 
bleeding episodes only. Subjects in the on-demand cohort had to have at least 12 documented bleeding 
episodes requiring treatment within 12 months prior to enrollment. The mean treatment duration in the 
on-demand cohort was 3.5±1.00 months (median 3.4, ranging from 1.2 to 5.1 months), the mean total 
annualised bleeding rate (ABR) was 33.9±17.37 with a median of 27.0, ranging from 12.9 to 73.1.
8
The median ABR on prophylaxis with RIXUBIS for all bleeds was 2.0, for spontaneous bleeds 0.0, 
and for joint bleeds 0.0. 24 subjects (42.9%) experienced zero bleeds.
A total of 249 bleeding episodes were treated with RIXUBIS, of which 197 were joint bleeds 
and 52 non-joint bleeds (soft tissue, muscle, body cavity, intracranial and other). Of a total 
of 249 bleeding episodes, 163 were moderate, 71 were minor, and 15 were major. Treatment was 
individualised based on the severity, cause and site of bleed. Of the 249 bleeding episodes, the 
majority (211; 84.7%) were treated with 1-2 infusions. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of bleed was 
rated excellent or good in 96% of all treated bleeding episodes.
Prophylaxis and control of bleeding in PTPs below 12 years:
The efficacy of RIXUBIS has been evaluated in a combined phase 2/3 study, in which a total 
of 23 male PTPs between 1.8 and 11.8 years (median age 7.10 years) with 11 patients < 6 years, 
received RIXUBIS for prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. All subjects had severe (factor 
IX level <1%) or moderately severe (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. All 23 subjects received 
prophylactic treatment with RIXUBIS for a minimum of 3 months and were included in the efficacy 
evaluation for prophylaxis.
The median ABR was 2.0, for spontaneous bleeds 0.0 and for joint bleeds 0.0.
Nine subjects (39.1%) experienced zero bleeds.
A total of 26 bleeding episodes were treated with RIXUBIS, of which 23 bleeds were due to 
injury, 2 spontaneous and 1 of unknown origin. 19 bleeds were non-joint (soft tissue, muscle, body 
cavity, intracranial and other) and 7 were joint bleeds of which 1 was a bleed into a target joint. 
Of the 26 bleeding episodes, 15 were minor, 9 moderate, and 2 major. Treatment was individualised 
based on the severity, cause and site of bleed The majority (23; 88,5%) were treated 
with 1-2 infusions. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of a bleed was rated excellent or good 
in 96.2% of all treated bleeding episodes.
Perioperative management:
The safety and efficacy in the perioperative setting was evaluated in a phase 3 prospective, open-label, 
uncontrolled, multicenter study in male PTPs with severe and moderately severe haemophilia B using 
RIXUBIS. The per-protocol efficacy analysis includes 37 surgeries performed in 27 patients 
between 17 and 57 years of age undergoing major or minor surgical, dental or other surgical invasive 
procedures. Twenty procedures were major including 13 orthopaedic and 3 dental 
surgeries. 17 procedures, including 10 dental extractions, were considered minor. Patients undergoing 
major surgeries had to perform a pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation. All patients were dosed based on 
their most recent individual incremental recovery. The recommended initial loading dose of RIXUBIS 
was to ensure that during surgery, factor IX activity levels of 80-100% for major surgeries 
and 30-60% for minor surgeries were maintained. RIXUBIS was administered by bolus infusions.
Haemostasis was maintained throughout the study duration.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
RIXUBIS in previously untreated patients in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in 
haemophilia B (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Previously treated patients 12 years and older:
A randomised, blinded, controlled, crossover pharmacokinetic study of RIXUBIS and a comparator 
was conducted in non-bleeding male subjects (≥15 years of age) as part of the combined 
phase 1/3 pivotal study. The subjects received either of the products as a single intravenous infusion. 
The mean (± SD) and median dose of RIXUBIS in the per protocol analysis set (n=25) 
were 74.69±2.37 and 74.25 IU/kg, respectively, with a range of 71.27 to 79.38 IU/kg. The 
9
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from factor IX activitiy measurements in blood samples 
obtained up to 72 hours following each infusion.
The pharmacokinetic evaluation was repeated for RIXUBIS in an open-label, uncontrolled study with 
RIXUBIS in male subjects who participated in the initial PK crossover study and had received 
prophylaxis with RIXUBIS for 26±1 weeks (mean ± SD) and accumulated at least 30 exposure days 
(EDs) to RIXUBIS. The RIXUBIS dose range in the repeat pharmacokinetics study 
was 64.48 to 79.18 IU/kg (n=23).
Pharmacokinetic parameters for evaluable subjects (per-protocol analysis) are presented in the table

Paediatric population (previously treated patients younger than 12 years)
All 23 male subjects underwent an initial pharmacokinetic evaluation of RIXUBIS in a non-bleeding 
state as part of the combined phase 2/3 paediatric study. Subjects were randomised to one of two blood 
sampling sequences to reduce the burden of frequent blood draws on the individual subjects. The mean 
(± SD) and median dose of RIXUBIS in the full analysis set (n=23) 
was 75.50 ± 3.016 and 75.25 IU/kg, respectively, with a range of 70.0 to 83.6 IU/kg. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from factor IX activity measurements in blood samples 
obtained up to 72 hours following the infusion.

Incremental recovery 30 minutes after infusion was determined for all subjects in the combined 
phase 2/3 study at the initial pharmacokinetic evaluation (exposure day 1), at week 5, 13, and 26 visits, 
and at the time of study completion or termination, if it did not coincide with the week 26 visit. The 
data demonstrate that the incremental recovery is consistent over time across all paediatric age groups.

Preclinical safety data
RIXUBIS was not thrombogenic at a dose of 750 IU/kg in a rabbit stasis model (Wessler-Test).
RIXUBIS did not cause any adverse clinical, respiratory, or cardiovascular effects up to 450 IU/kg in 
cynomolgus monkeys.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment, and fetal development have been 
conducted.
RIXUBIS was well tolerated in single dose and repeated dose toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats 
and cynomolgus monkeys up to doses of 7500 IU/kg (single dose) and 750 IU/kg (repeated 
application).

Shelf life
3 years.
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 3 hours at a temperature not 
above 30°C. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the 
risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. Do not refrigerate.
6.4
Special precautions for storage
Store below 30°C.
Do not freeze.
For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.
6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use
One pack contains a powder vial (type I glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber) and a flip-off seal, a vial 
containing 5 ml solvent (type I glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber, or bromobutyl rubber) and a 
flip-off seal and a needle-less reconstitution device (BAXJECT II).

6.6
Special precautions for disposal and other handling
RIXUBIS is to be administered intravenously after reconstitution of the powder with the provided 
solvent.
-
-
-
For reconstitution use only the solvent and the reconstitution device (BAXJECT II) provided in 
the pack.
For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.
Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or 
shows any sign of deterioration.
Reconstitution
Use Aseptic Technique
1.
If the product is  stored in a refrigerator, take both the RIXUBIS powder and solvent vials from 
the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15°C and 30°C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3.
4.
5.
Remove caps from powder and solvent vials.
Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface.
Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the 
inside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package.
Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the 
package at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap 
from the BAXJECT II device.
6.
7. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so that the solvent vial is on 
top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the RIXUBIS stopper. The vacuum will 
draw the solvent into the RIXUBIS vial (Fig. c).
13
8.
Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. The product dissolves rapidly (within 2 minutes). 
Be sure that RIXUBIS is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass 
through the device filter. Reconstituted medicinal products should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or 
slightly opalescent. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits.
Fig. a

3.
4.
Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II. Do not draw air into the syringe. Connect the 
syringe to BAXJECT II (Fig. d).
Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the 
reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Fig. e).
Disconnect the syringe.
Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be 
administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml 
per minute.

IX is a normal constituent of human blood necessary for effective blood clotting. RIXUBIS is used in 
patients with haemophilia B (Christmas disease, an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of 
factor IX). It works by replacing the missing factor IX to enable the patient’s blood to clot.
RIXUBIS is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B of all 
age groups.
2. What you need to know before you use RIXUBIS
Do not use RIXUBIS
-
if you are allergic to nonacog gamma or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are allergic to hamster proteins
-
Warnings and precautions
Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with RIXUBIS. Stop your infusion and contact 
your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care if you experience early signs of 
hypersensitivity/allergic reactions like hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure 
or anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing, red or 
swollen face and/or hands). Your doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. Your 
doctor may also do a blood test to check if you have developed activity-neutralising antibodies
41
(inhibitors) against your medicine, as inhibitors may develop together with allergies. Patients with 
factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with factor IX.
Talk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you experience a 
significant increase in your usage of RIXUBIS in order to control a bleed. Your doctor will do a blood 
test to check if you have developed activity-neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against RIXUBIS. The 
risk for developing inhibitors is highest in patients who have not been treated with a factor IX 
replacement medicine before or in the early phases of treatment, i.e. for small children.
The production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene. Patients who have specific 
mutations of their factor IX gene such as major deletion may be more likely to have factor IX 
inhibitors and an allergic reaction in the early period with any factor IX concentrate. Therefore if you 
are known to have such a mutation, your doctor will monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic 
reaction.
If you suffer from liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had major surgery, please inform 
your doctor, as there is an increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications.
Kidney disorders (nephrotic syndrome) have been reported following high doses of Factor IX in 
haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
Whenever possible, please record the name of the product and the batch number every time you use 
RIXUBIS (e.g. in your diary) to keep track of the products and product batches you have used.
Other medicines and RIXUBIS
Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines. No 
interactions of RIXUBIS with other medicines are known.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia B very rarely occurs in women.
Driving and using machines
RIXUBIS has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
RIXUBIS contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. However, depending on your body weight and your dose of RIXUBIS, you could receive more 
than one vial. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.
3.
How to use RIXUBIS
Treatment with RIXUBIS will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia B.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
Your doctor will decide the dose of RIXUBIS you will receive. This dose and duration will depend on 
the severity of your factor IX deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on your 
clinical condition, age and how quickly your body uses up factor IX which will have to be checked 
regularly.
RIXUBIS is administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution of the powder with the 
provided solvent by your doctor or nurse. You or somebody else might also administer RIXUBIS as 
an injection but only after receiving adequate training.
42
Reconstitution and administration

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Treatment monitoring
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity plasma level has been attained, careful monitoring using 
an appropriate factor IX activity assay is advised and, if necessary, appropriate adjustments to the dose 
and the frequency of repeated infusions should be performed. When using an in vitro thromboplastin 
time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients’ blood 
samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT 
reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing 
the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.
47
Posology
Dose and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on 
the location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient’s clinical condition, age and 
pharmacokinetic parameters of factor IX, such as incremental recovery and half-life.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed 
either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an 
International Standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit  of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of 
normal human plasma.
Adult population
On demand treatment:
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.9 IU/dL (range 
from 0.5 to 1.4 IU/dL) or 0.9% of normal activity in patients 12 years and older (further information 
see section 5.2).
The required dose is determined using the following formula:
Required 
units
=
body weight (kg)
x
desired factor IX rise
(%) or (IU/dL)
x
reciprocal of observed 
recovery (dL/kg)
For an incremental recovery of 0.9 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
Required 
units
=
body weight (kg)
x
desired factor IX rise
(%) or (IU/dL)
x
1.1 dL/kg
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/Type 
of surgical procedure
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle 
bleeding or oral bleeding
Factor IX level
required (%) or 
(IU/dL)
20 – 40
More extensive haemarthrosis, 
muscle bleeding or haematoma
30 – 60
Life-threatening haemorrhages.
60 – 100
Surgery
30 – 60
Minor surgery including tooth 
extraction
48
Frequency of doses 
(hours)/Duration
of therapy (days)
Repeat every 24 hours. At least 1 day, 
until the bleeding episode as indicated 
by pain is resolved or healing is 
achieved.
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 
3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved.
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved.
Degree of haemorrhage/Type 
of surgical procedure
Factor IX level
required (%) or 
(IU/dL)
Frequency of doses 
(hours)/Duration
of therapy (days)
Major surgery
80 – 100
(pre- and postoperative)
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor IX activity of 30% 
to 60% (IU/dl).
Careful monitoring of replacement therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or 
life-threatening haemorrhages.
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses 
are 40 to 60 IU of factor IX per kilogram of body weight at intervals of 3 to 4 days for 
patients 12 years and older. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, 
age, bleeding phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be 
necessary.
Continuous infusion
Do not administer RIXUBIS by continuous infusion.
Paediatric population
Patients aged 12 to 17 years of age:
Posology is the same in adults and paediatric population from 12 to 17.
Patients less than 12 years:
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.7 IU/dL (range 
from 0.31 to 1.0 IU/dL) or 0.7% of normal activity in patients less than 12 years of age (further 
information see section 5.2).
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Patients less than 12 years:
Required 
units
=
body weight (kg)
x
desired factor IX rise
(%) or (IU/dL)
x
reciprocal of observed 
recovery (dL/kg)
For an incremental recovery of 0.7 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
Required 
units
=
body weight (kg)
x
desired factor IX rise
(%) or (IU/dL)
x
1.4 dL/kg
The same table as for adults can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery (see above).
Prophylaxis:
The recommended dose range for paediatric patients less than 12 years is 40 to 80 IU/kg at intervals 
of 3 to 4 days. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, age, bleeding 
phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

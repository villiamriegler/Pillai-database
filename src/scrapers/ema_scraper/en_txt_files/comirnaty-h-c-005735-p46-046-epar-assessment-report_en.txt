1.  Introduction 
On 2022-01-21, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Comirnaty, in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. Study C4591017 is part of a clinical development program, as 
per the line listing included in the submission (Annex to this report). The submission is performed 6 months 
after completion of study on 22 July 2021.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
C4591017: A phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of multiple production lots and dose levels of the vaccine candidate BNT162b2 against 
COVID-19 in healthy participants 12 through 50 years of age and the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
of BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates as a booster dose in healthy participants 18 through 
50 years of age. 
Study C4591017 is a Phase 3 study with 2 parts.  
• 
• 
Evaluations of multiple production lots and doses of BNT162b2 in the primary study were performed 
for healthy participants 12-50 years of age.  
Evaluations of BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the booster study were 
performed for healthy participants 18-50 years of age.  
The last patients last visit (LPLV) occurred on 22 July 2022 and the final CSR approved on 06 January 2022.  
The current EU-approved indication for the use of Comirnaty 30 µg is  
•  Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 12 years of age 
and older  
In the clinical development program of the mRNA vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, BNT162b2 30 µg, 
paediatric participants ≥12 years of age were granted conditional marketing approval by the EMA on 
28 May 2021. The Line Extension (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) to introduce a further presentation (10 µg) 
and extend the indication to paediatric individuals from 5 to <12 years of age was approved by the EC on 26 
November 2021.  
Assessors’ comments: The FDA guidelines require companies to demonstrate a lot-to- lot consistency to 
ensure similar immunogenicity of the different vaccine batches. For this reason, study C4591017 was 
conducted. The main aim of this study is to demonstrate that a similar immune response is induced by 4 lots   
of BNT162b2 and describe the safety and tolerability of these different vaccine  lots in healthy participants, 
thereby supporting both US and EU manufacturing processes at commercial scale.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
BNT162b2 (Comirnaty), an RNA-based vaccine for immunization against COVID-19. All 4 production lots were 
administered at a 30-µg dose and 1 of the lots was also administered at a 20-µg dose, with the group names 
Arms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
C4591017: A phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of multiple production lots and dose levels of the vaccine candidate BNT162b2 against 
COVID-19 in healthy participants 12 through 50 years of age and the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
of BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates as a booster dose in healthy participants 18 through 
50 years of age. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study C4591017 
Description 
Study C4591017 is a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study that includes both a primary and booster 
study. The focus of this report is the primary study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
multiple production lots and dose levels of BNT162b2 against COVID-19 in healthy participants 12-50 years 
of age. There were no paediatric participants in the booster study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates as a booster dose in healthy 
participants 18-50 years of age and therefore this part of the study will not be presented and discussed in the 
current assessment report (AR). 
In the primary study, participants were randomized to 1 of 5 arms in a 2:2:2:1:2 ratio (Arm 1: Arm 2: Arm 
3: Arm 4: Arm 5), where Arms 1, 2, and 3 used US-manufactured drug substance for 30-µg dosing; Arm 4 
used EU-manufactured drug substance for 30-µg dosing; and Arm 5 contained US-manufactured drug 
substance for 20-µg dosing (US Lot 1). To allow for balanced age representation across all arms, the 
randomization was stratified by age groups: 12-17, 18-30, and 31-50 years of age. BNT162b2 was 
administered as a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days. 
One aim of this study is to demonstrate that a similar immune response is induced by 4 lots    of 
BNT162b2 (3 containing drug substance manufactured in the US, referred to as the “US lots” [Arms 
1 through 3] and 1 containing drug substance manufactured in Europe [Arm 4], referred to as the 
“EU lot”), and describe the safety and tolerability of these different vaccine  lots in healthy 
participants, thereby supporting both US and EU manufacturing processes at commercial scale. One 
of the US lots was administered at a 20-µg dose (Arm 5) and compared with the standard 30-µg 
dose from the same US lot in a noninferiority analysis. This objective would support the potential use 
of a lower vaccine dose in the defined study   population, which will be of value, given the demand to

vaccinate the general population. The results of 20-µg dose comparison with 30-µg dose will be 
presented at later time point as sCSR.

Arms 1 through 3 were administered a 30-µg dose level of lots 1 through 3, respectively, containing    
US-manufactured drug substance. 
Arm 4 was administered a 30-µg dose level of Lot 4, containing EU-manufactured drug substance. 
Arm 5 was administered a 20-µg dose level from the corresponding US lot (Arm 1, 2, or 3).

Sample size 
The study sample size was based on the lot-to-lot similarity evaluation for the first and second primary 
immunogenicity endpoints, full-length S-binding IgG concentrations 1 month after Dose 2, using a 1.5-fold 
equivalence margin for each between-lot comparison across the 3 US lots (Arms 1 to 3) and the comparison 
of the EU Lot (Arm 4) to the US lots. 
Power calculations are based on the pairwise comparison of 0 vs δ, 0 vs δ, and 0 vs 0 for the mean full-
length S-binding IgG levels (on the natural log scale) between 2 US lots and 0 vs δ between the EU lot and 
the pooled US lots.  A δ of 0.2 corresponds to an assumption that the true GMR of any lot to another lot is 
between 0.82 and 1.22. Common assay standard deviations from each lot are assumed to be 0.6456 based 
on results from Phase 1 of Study C4591001 (BNT162b2 30 μg 18- to 55-year age group). With 270 evaluable 
participants per US lot (Arms 1-3), and the stated assumptions on the maximum between-lot difference and 
the standard deviation, the study has a power of 91.7% for considering the 3 US lots to be similar. The study 
will also provide 92.8% power for considering the EU lot (Arm 4) similar to the US lots, with 135 evaluable 
participants in the EU lot (Arm 4) and 810 evaluable participants in the pooled US lots (Arms 1-3) (see Table 
3).With 270 evaluable participants each in the 20-μg dose group and corresponding 30-μg dose group, and 
assumptions on the standard deviation and mean difference of -0.2 in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers (on the 
natural log scale) between the 2 dose groups, the study has 94.7% power to declare noninferiority of 20 μg 
to 30 μg (Table 3). Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 20%, the study will randomize approximately 340 
participants in each US lot (Arms 1-3), 170 participants in the EU lot (Arm 4), and 340 participants in the 20-
μg dose group (Arm 5) to achieve the required evaluable participants.

Randomisation and blinding (masking)  
Allocation (randomization) of participants to vaccine groups was proceeded through the use of an IRT system. 
The majority of sponsor and Pfizer staff were blinded to the study intervention allocation. The blinded study 
team was unblinded to the primary study randomization information at the  time of database release of the 
primary study. These same study team members remained blinded to the randomization information for the 
booster study until completion of that phase. 
The primary and booster studies were observer-blinded for staff at the investigative sites. The  staff who 
received, stored, dispensed, prepared, and administered the study interventions were unblinded. All other 
site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and participants, were blinded to study 
intervention assignments. 
Statistical Methods 
Unless stated otherwise, “vaccine group” in this section refers to participants receiving any 1 of the three 30-
μg US lots, the (30-μg) EU lot, or the 20-μg dose group for the primary study and to participants receiving 
BNT162b2 at 30 μg or BNT162b2.B.1.351 at 30 μg.  
CIs for all endpoints in the statistical analysis are presented as 2-sided at the 95% level unless    specified 
otherwise. 
For all the immunogenicity endpoints, the analysis was based on the evaluable immunogenicity 
population. An additional analysis was performed based on the all-available  immunogenicity population 
if there was a 10% difference in sample size between the all-available immunogenicity population and 
the evaluable immunogenicity population. Participants were summarized according to the vaccine group 
to which they were randomized.

Analyses for Binary Data 
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables (eg, proportions) are the percentage (%), the numerator (n) 
and the denominator (N) used in the percentage calculation, and the 95% CIs where applicable. 
The exact 95% CI for binary endpoints for each group will be computed using the F distribution (Clopper-
Pearson). 
Analyses for Continuous Data 
Unless otherwise stated, descriptive statistics for continuous variables are n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum. 
Geometric Mean Ratios 
Model-Based 
As the primary approach, the GMR and associated 95% CI will be calculated by exponentiating the difference 
in LS means and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed assay results using a 
linear regression model. 
Unadjusted 
The GMRs will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results 
between 2 vaccine groups and exponentiating the mean. Two-sided CIs will be obtained by calculating CIs 
using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and 
exponentiating the confidence limits. 
Geometric Means 
The geometric means will be calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm 
transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two-sided 95% CIs 
will be obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s 
t-distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits. 
Geometric Mean Fold Rises 
GMFRs are defined as ratios of the results at a later time point to the results at an earlier time point. GMFRs 
are limited to participants with non-missing values at both time point. GMFRs will be calculated as the mean 
of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later time point minus earlier time point) and 
exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs will be obtained by constructing CIs using 
Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence 
limits. 
Immunogenicity evaluations 
Serum samples were obtained for testing via the full-length S-binding IgG-concentration assay. SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing titers for the primary study and all immunogenicity test results in the booster study are not 
included in the submitted CSR and will be presented in the sCSR. 
Nasal (midturbinate) swabs were obtained in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR (NAAT) as one of the     
determinations for participants to be included in the evaluable immunogenicity analysis.

Additional details on the collection and analysis of biological samples, including long-term  storage and usage, 
are provided in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 8.1 of the submitted CSR. 
Immunogenicity analysis 
The 3 primary immunogenicity objectives are to be assessed sequentially in the following order to 
control study wise type I error: 1) similarity across the 3 US lots, 2) noninferiority of  the 20-µg dose 
level to the 30-µg dose level, and 3) similarity between the EU Lot and the pooled US lots. The primary 
immunogenicity objective of similarity between the EU Lot and  the pooled US lots is to be assessed 
only if the other 2 primary objectives are met. The second objective of noninferiority of the 20-µg dose 
level to the 30-µg dose level will be analysed in the sCSR, so the third objective of similarity between 
the EU Lot and the pooled US lots cannot be formally assessed in this CSR. 
Model-Based: As the main approach in the primary study, the GMR and associated 95% CI were 
calculated by exponentiating the difference in LS means and the corresponding CIs based on analysis 
of logarithmically transformed assay results using a linear regression model with terms of age and 
vaccine group. 
Unadjusted: The GMRs in the primary study were calculated as the mean of the difference of 
logarithmically transformed assay results between 2 vaccine groups and exponentiating the mean. 
Two-sided CIs will be obtained by calculating CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference 
of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits. 
The analysis of S-binding IgG in the primary study presented in this CSR is summarized below. 
GMRs of full-length S-binding IgG concentrations between the US lots 
•  For full-length S-binding levels, the GMRs for each between-lot comparison (Arm 
1/Arm 2, Arm 1/Arm 3, and Arm 2/Arm 3) at 1 month after Dose 2 were provided 
along with associated 2-sided 95% CIs. 
•  Using a 1.5-fold equivalence margin, 2 lots will be considered similar if the 2-sided 95% CI 
for each GMR is contained in the interval (0.67, 1.5). The 3 US lots will be considered 
similar if the 1.5-fold equivalence criterion is met for all 3 between-lot comparisons (Arm 1 
to Arm 2, Arm 1 to Arm 3, and Arm 2 to Arm 3). 
GMR of full-length S-binding IgG concentrations between the EU Lot and the 3 US lots 
•  The GMR of the EU Lot (Arm 4) to the pooled US lots (Arm 4/pooled Arms 1, 2, and 3) at 1 
month after Dose 2 will be provided along with associated 2-sided 95% CIs. 
•  Using a 1.5-fold equivalence margin, the EU Lot (Arm 4) and the pooled US lots (Arms 1 to 
3) will be considered similar if the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is contained in the interval 
(0.67, 1.5) and primary objectives on the US lot similarity and dose comparison are both 
met. 
GMCs of full-length S-binding IgG concentrations 
•  The GMCs and 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for each vaccine group (individual US lots, 
the pooled US lots, and the EU Lot) at baseline (before Dose 1) and at 1 month after Dose 
2.

GMFRs of full-length S-binding IgG concentrations 
•  The GMFRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for each vaccine group (individual US lots, 
the pooled US lots, and the EU Lot) from baseline (before Dose 1) to 1 month after Dose 
2. 
Assessor´s comment: the design and methods of the study are acceptable. 
Safety evaluations 
Electronic Diary 
Participants used a reactogenicity e-diary and recorded local reactions, systemic events, and 
antipyretic/analgesic medication usage for 7 days from the day of administration of the study intervention. 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
During the primary study, AEs and SAEs were collected during the study from the signing of the ICD through 
and including Visit 3 (1-month follow-up). In addition, any AEs occurring up to 48 hours after the blood draw 
and nasal swab collection at Visit 3 reported by the participant were collected. 
Safety analysis 
The safety analyses were based on the safety population. Participants were summarized by vaccine 
group according to the investigational products they received. 
Descriptive statistics are provided for each reactogenicity endpoint for each dose and vaccine group. 
Local reactions and systemic events from Day 1 through Day 7 after each vaccination are presented by 
severity and cumulatively across severity levels. Descriptive summary statistics included counts and 
percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. 
AEs and SAEs are categorized according to MedDRA terms. Counts, percentages, and the associated 
Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs of AEs and SAEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 are provided for each 
vaccine group. 
Assessor´s comment: the design and methods of the study safety evaluations are acceptable. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In the primary study, 1574 participants 12-50 years of age were randomised and 1573 (99.9%) vaccinated 
with at least 1 dose that were included in the safety population. A total of 1557 (98.9%) of participants 
completed the study; of the 2 participants who discontinued from the investigational product for 
safety-related reasons (both discontinued from receiving Dose 2 but continued in the study for safety follow-
up), neither were paediatric participants 12-17 years of age.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted in the USA, 16 sites participated. Each site recruited around 100 subjects. First 
subject first visit took place on 15 February 2021 and last subject last visit on 22 July 2021. 
Baseline data 
Almost all participants (99.9%) in each vaccine group received Dose 1 in the primary study  and overall, 
98.0% of participants received Dose 2 within the protocol-specified time frame (Table 6). One participant 
randomized to receive US Lot 1 received US Lot 3 at Dose 2 and was excluded from the evaluable 
immunogenicity population.

The safety population (N=1573) in the primary study was similarly distributed between male and female 
participants, and the majority of participants were White and non-Hispanic/non-Latino. Participants were 
similarly distributed across age groups and included a total of 445 (28.3%; range: 27.3-29.2%) paediatric 
participants 12-17 years of age.

Overall, there was a total of 151 (9.6%) participants excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity 
population in the primary study (Table 9). The most common reasons for exclusion were: had a non-
negative result for either of the SARS-CoV-2 tests (RT-PCR or N-binding antibody assay) during the 
primary study (100 [6.4%]) and did not have at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result 
within 28 to 42 days after Dose 2 (65 [4.1%] participants). 
Overall, there was a total of 20 (1.3%) participants excluded from the all-available immunogenicity 
population in the primary study (Table 9). The main reason for exclusion   was: did not have at least 1 valid 
and determinate immunogenicity result after vaccination (20 [1.3%] participants). 
Table 9. Immunogenicity Populations – Primary Study 
Assessor´s comment: the study had high adherence as around 90 % of the randomized population became 
the evaluable immunogenicity population. 
Primary Immunogenicity 
The 3 primary immunogenicity objectives in the primary study are to be assessed sequentially in the 
following order to control study wise type I error: 1) similarity across the 3 US lots, 2) noninferiority of the 
20-µg dose level to the 30-µg dose level, and 3) similarity between the EU lot and the pooled US lots.

For the primary immunogenicity (GMR) analyses in participants 12-50 years of age, there were no analyses 
specific to paediatric participants 12-17 years of age. 
The 3 US lots (Arms 1, 2, and 3) met the 1.5-fold equivalence criteria for all 3 between-lot full length 
S-binding IgG model-based GMR (95% CI) comparisons and were considered similar.

Lots – 1 Month After Dose 2 – Linear Regression – Primary Study – Evaluable Immunogenicity 
Population 
Assessor´s comment: similar immunogenicity of 3 different vaccine lots manufactured in the USA was 
demonstrated. 
The similarity of the EU lot (Arm 4) to the pooled US lots cannot be formally declared until the dose 
comparison analysis is conducted in the sCSR however, the full-length S-binding IgG GMR (95% CI) of the EU 
lot to the pooled US lots was contained in the interval (0.67, 1.5) defined by the 1.5-fold equivalence margin.

Assessor´s comment: similar immunogenicity of pooled vaccine lots manufactured in the USA and one 
vaccine lot from the EU was demonstrated. Non-inferiority analysis is expected to be shown in coming sCSR. 
Secondary Immunogenicity 
For the secondary immunogenicity (GMFR, GMC) analyses in participants 12-50 years of age, data specific to 
paediatric participants 12-17 years of age was included for the GMC analyses only. 
Full-length S-binding IgG GMFRs (95% CI) from baseline to 1 month after Dose 2 were similar for all the US 
lots. Full-length S-binding IgG GMFRs (95% CI) from baseline to 1 month after Dose 2 were similar for the 
EU lot and the pooled US lots. 
Table 12. Geometric Mean Fold Rise in Full-Length S-Binding IgG Concentrations (U/mL) From Baseline to 1 
Month After Dose 2 – Primary Study – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Full-length S-binding IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 2 across all vaccine groups were lower in older age 
subgroups (12-17 years of age ranged from 9582.2 to 11857.6, 18-30 years of age ranged from 5653.1 to 
6929.1, and 31-50 years of age ranged from 4182.9 to 4743.3). 
Assessor´s comment: As for the primary immunogenicity endpoint (GMC) also the secondary endpoint 
(GMFR) demonstrated similarity between USA vaccine lots. 
MAH Immunogenicity conclusions: 
• 
The 3 US lots met the 1.5-fold equivalence criteria for all 3 between-lot full-length S-binding IgG 
comparisons and were considered similar (model-based GMR [95% CI] estimates were contained in 
the interval [0.67, 1.5]: US Lot 1 to US Lot 2: 1.01 [0.91,1.13]; US Lot 1 to US Lot 3: 0.93 [0.83, 
1.04]; and US Lot 2 to US Lot 3: 0.92 [0.82, 1.03]). Similar results were observed in the all-available 
population for model-based GMRs and in the evaluable immunogenicity and all-available 
immunogenicity population for unadjusted GMRs. 
• 
The similarity of the EU lot to the pooled US lots cannot be formally declared until the      dose 
comparison analysis is conducted in the sCSR, however the full-length S-binding  IgG GMR (95% CI) 
of the EU lot to the pooled US lots was contained in the interval (0.67, 1.5) defined by the 1.5-fold 
equivalence margin.

• 
Full-length S-binding IgG GMFRs (95% CI) from baseline to 1 month after Dose 2 were  similar for all 
the US lots. Full-length S-binding IgG GMFRs (95% CI) from baseline to 1 month after Dose 2 were 
similar for the EU lot and the pooled US lots. 
•  Safety results 
• 
There were no paediatric participants in the booster study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates as a booster dose in healthy 
participants 18-50 years of age and thereby only results from the primary study are discussed below. 
•  Local reactions 
The proportion of participants reporting local reactions in the primary study was similar across all 
vaccine groups (Fig 2). The proportion of participants reporting local reactions, in general, were 
similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2. The most common local reaction reported after Dose 1 or Dose 2 
was pain at the injection site (range: 78.1% to 86.1% of participants after Dose 1 and 77.3% to 
83.1% of participants after Dose 2). Most local reactions after Dose 1 or Dose 2 were mild to 
moderate with no Grade 4 local reactions reported. The proportions of participants reporting local 
reactions by maximum severity by subgroup (age group, race, and sex) were similar. Median 
duration of local reactions was 1 to 4 days after Dose 1 and 1 to 2 days after Dose 2. Median onset 
day of any local reactions after Dose 1 or Dose 2 was Day 1.

Assessor´s comment: The proportion of participants reporting local reactions was similar across all vaccine 
groups. The most common local reaction was pain at the injection site. Most local reaction events were mild 
or moderate with no Grade 4 events reported. 
The safety results evaluating local reactions are in agreement with previously reported studies. 
Systemic Events 
The proportion of participants reporting systemic events in the primary study was similar across all vaccine 
groups (Fig 3). In general, a higher proportion of participants reported systemic events after Dose 2 than 
after Dose 1. The most common systemic events reported after Dose 1 or Dose 2 were fatigue (range: 
45.5% to 53.3% and 66.6% to 71.4% participants, respectively), headache (range: 32.7% to 38.7% and 
50.6% to 57.0% participants, respectively), and new or worsened muscle pain (range: 13.1% to 17.3% and 
32.7% to 38.6% participants, respectively). Most systemic events after Dose 1 and Dose 2 were mild to 
moderate with no Grade 4 systemic events reported. The use of antipyretic/analgesic medication ranged from 
14.5% to 22.0% after Dose 1 and 35.2% to 41.9% after Dose 2 for all vaccine groups. The proportions of 
participants reporting systemic events by maximum severity by subgroup (age group, race, and sex) were 
similar. Median duration of systemic events was 1 to 2 days after Dose 1 and Dose 2. Median onset day of 
any systemic events after Dose 1 was Day 1 and after Dose 2 was Day 2.

The incidence of any AE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 in the primary study ranged from 5.2% (US Lot 
3) to 10.4% (EU Lot) (Table 13). There was a total of 2 SAEs, both of which were severe, but neither were 
related.  
There was a total of 2 participants who were withdrawn for safety-related reasons: 1 participant was 
withdrawn because of pregnancy, and 1 participant reported AEs of dermatitis and angioedema which were 
assessed by the investigator as related to the investigational product (1 participant who received 20 μg of US 
Lot 1[Arm 5]). 
AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 were most commonly reported in the SOCs of infections and 
infestations (0.3% to 2.9% of participants) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0 to 2.9% of 
participants).  
Related AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 were most commonly reported in the SOCs of 
gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders (both 0 to 1.2% of participants), general disorders 
and administration site conditions (0 to 1.1% of participants), and blood and lymphatic system disorders (0 
to 0.9% of participants). There were no life-threatening AEs (Table 13). 
Severe AEs by PT from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 were reported by single participants in each vaccine 
group. 
Immediate AEs reported after Dose 1 were lymphadenopathy (1 participant who received US Lot 2) and 
injection site pain (1 participant who received 20 μg of US Lot 1[Arm 5]). Immediate AEs reported after Dose 
2 were hypoaesthesia (1 participant who received the EU Lot) and injection site pain (1 participant who 
received 20 μg of US Lot 1[Arm 5]).

Serious Adverse Events 
There were 2 participants who reported an SAE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 (Table 14). One 
participant who received US Lot 3 at Dose 1 experienced an exposure during pregnancy on study day 1 
followed by an SAE of spontaneous abortion on study day 30 that was not related to the investigational

vaccine as assessed by the investigator. The participant was withdrawn from the vaccination phase of the 
study because of the pregnancy. One participant who received the EU lot experienced an SAE of status 
migrainosus on study day 10 that was not related to the investigational vaccine as assessed by the 
investigator. 
Serious Adverse Events Narratives (in short) 
A 12-17 year old participant with a pertinent medical history of migraine , received Dose 1 (Arm 4 [EU lot]) on Day 1 and 
Dose 2 (Arm 4 [EU lot]) on Day 21. The participant experienced status migrainosus on Day 30, 9 days after receiving Dose 
2. After receiving Dose 2, the participant reported moderate headache and fatigue. Both symptoms improved and were 
totally absent on Day 24. On Day 25, the participant reported headache and fatigue again and since then, reported 
headache every day with a variable intensity from mild to moderate. On Day 30 the headache and fatigue worsened to 
severe and the participant was treated as outpatient While being attended the participant presented with rash, neck pain, 
and headache. The participant received the diagnosis of status migrainosus, with an onset date on Day 30. On Day 32, the 
participant’s symptoms worsened again. Post evaluation by pediatric neurology, infectious disease, rheumatology, vascular 
surgery, and hematology, the participant was admitted to the hospital on Day 34, with the diagnosis of status migrainosus. 
The participant reported debilitating fatigue, headache, and photosensitivity. The site was informed that the participant 
was started on a migraine medication according to a protocol. The participant was also prescribed ketorolac, ondansetron, 
and valproic acid. The participant’s hospitalization was complicated by bilateral arm phlebitis (which later resolved post 
discharge) following dihydroergotamine IV treatment. On the same day, the participant underwent laboratory tests, which 
included protein electrophoresis, which showed albumin at 4.9 g/dL (normal range [NR]: 3.8-4.8 g/dL), and normal levels 
of alpha 1 globulin at, alpha 2 globulin, beta 1 globulin, beta 2 globulin, gamma globulin, total protein. Human leukocyte 
antigen B27 antigen result was positive, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) screen with reflex was negative, and 
ANCA screen immunofluorescence assay was negative. On Day 35, the participant underwent brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) with and without contrast, which showed normal results. A SARS-CoV-2 test result was negative. OnDay 36, 
after ranitidine hydrochloride and prior to dihydroergotamine treatment, the participant developed an extrapyramidal 
reaction (dystonic reaction) with pulling of the head to the right and some failing movements. The participant was given 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride and the symptoms resolved. The participant also received prochlorperazine. Headache and 
fatigue improved mildly over hospitalization. The participant’s pain went down to manageable 2/10 after 7 doses of 
dihydroergotamine. On Day 38, the participant was discharged from the hospital. On Day 56, the participant underwent a 
brain magnetic resonance venography to evaluate cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with negative results and on Day 57, 
an MRI venogram of head without contrast showed normal results. The participant continued to have daily migraines (level 
1-6), photophobia, sound sensitivity, daily fatigue, dizziness (new symptom started on Day 51), and felt lightheaded/dizzy 
assessed by the investigator related to the ongoing migraine. On Day 63, the headache intensity had decreased but they 
were still present almost every day. The status migrainosus was ongoing at the time of the last available report. In the 
opinion of the investigator, there was no reasonable possibility that the status migrainosus was related to the study 
intervention, concomitant medications, or clinical trial procedure. Pfizer concurred with the investigator’s causality 
assessment. 
A 31-50 year-old female with a pertinent medical history reproductive disorder, received Dose 1 (Arm 3 [US Lot 3]) on Day 
1. The participant had an exposure during pregnancy on Day 1after receiving Dose 1 and had a spontaneous abortion on 
Day 30. On Day 1, at the time of the first dose, the participant’s pregnancy test result was negative. The participant was 
seen for Visit 2 on Day 24 and informed the site of possible pregnancy. On Day 24, the pregnancy test performed on site 
was positive. The participant was informed that the second dose would not be given. The participant did not smoke, drink 
alcohol, or use illicit drugs during this pregnancy. On Day 26, the participant informed the site that she received her

second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (tozinameran; manufacturer: Pfizer) intramuscularly outside of the study and 
without consent of the site or the primary investigator on Day 24. The second dose was not part of the study vaccinations 
and was administered under emergency use authorization. On Day 30, the participant had a spontaneous abortion, which 
was considered medically significant. The participant was discontinued from the study intervention on Day 24 because of 
exposure during pregnancy and completed the follow-up visit on Day 52. In the opinion of the investigator, there was no 
reasonable possibility that the spontaneous abortion was related to the study intervention, concomitant medications, or 
clinical trial procedure, but rather it was related to the participant’s medical history of reproductive disorder. Pfizer 
concurred with the investigator’s causality assessment. 
A 18-30-year-old participant with a pertinent medical history of contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity, and angioedema, 
received Dose 1 (Arm 5 [20 μg]) on Day 1. The participant developed acute dermatitis (generalized) on Day 4, and 
angioedema (generalized) on Day 5. On Day 7, the participant had an increased white blood cell count (11.4, normal range 
and units not provided) and was positive for antinuclear antibody (1:40). The participant received an unspecified 
treatment. The participant was discontinued from the study intervention on Day 7 because of dermatitis and angioedema. 
On Day 23, the dermatitis and angioedema resolved. The participant completed the follow-up visit on Day 10. The events 
of antinuclear antibody positive and increased white blood cell count were ongoing at the time of study completion. In the 
opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the dermatitis and angioedema were related to the 
study intervention. 
A 31-50 year old participant with a pertinent medical history of drug hypersensitivity, seasonal allergy, and atrial 
fibrillation, received Dose 1 (Arm 2 [US Lot 2]) on Day 1 and Dose 2 (Arm 2 [US Lot 2]) on Day 47. The participant was 
diagnosed with COVID-19 based on symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result, performed on Day 21. On Day 31, 
the COVID-19 illness resolved. The participant was withdrawn from the study on Day 78 because of an unspecified reason. 
In the opinion of the investigator, there was no reasonable possibility that the COVID-19 was related to the study 
intervention. 
A 31-50 year old participant with a pertinent medical history of seasonal allergy), received Dose 1 (Arm 2 [US Lot 2]) on 
Day 1 and Dose 2 (Arm 2 [US Lot 2]) on Day 23. The participant was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on symptoms and a 
positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test result on Day 13. On Day 17 the COVID-19 illness resolved. In the opinion of the 
investigator, there was no reasonable possibility that the COVID-19 was related to the study intervention.

Safety-Related Participant Withdrawals 
There were 2 participants who were withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons. 
One participant who received US Lot 3 was withdrawn because of pregnancy (Narrative described above).  
One participant who received 20 μg of US Lot 1 (Arm 5) was withdrawn from the vaccination phase of the 
study because of related moderate AEs of dermatitis (study day 4) and angioedema (study day 5); the IP 
was withdrawn and these events resolved on study day 23.  
Other Significant Adverse Events 
There were 2 adult participants who received US Lot 2 who each reported an AE of special interest (COVID-
19) from Dose 1 and 1 month after Dose 2 in the primary study. Both AEs occurred before Dose 2. One of the 
participants was diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 on study day 21 based on symptoms and a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 NAAT (described above). The other participant was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 on study day 
13 based on symptoms and a positive rapid antigen test. While this diagnosis was based on signs/symptoms 
and an antigen test rather than a NAAT, this event was still considered an AESI by Pfizer (described above). 
There were no cases of MIS-C. 
Lymphadenopathy from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 was reported by 1 participant who received US Lot 1, 
3 participants who received US Lot 2, 1 participant who received the EU Lot, and 2 participants who received 
20 μg of US Lot 1 (Arm 5).

Furthermore, one adult participant who received 20 μg of US Lot 1 (Arm 5) was withdrawn from the 
vaccination phase of the study because of related moderate AEs of dermatitis and angioedema. 
There were no cases of MIS-C, and no deaths reported.  
The MAH assessments are agreed.  
The size of the study population was not large enough to detect rare AEs or rare SAEs. 
No new safety concerns are raised. 
MAH Safety Conclusions 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of participants reporting local reactions and systemic events was similar across all 
vaccine groups. The most common local reaction was pain at the injection site. The most common 
systemic events were fatigue, headache, and new or worsened muscle pain. Most local reactions and 
systemic events were mild or moderate with no Grade 4 events reported. 
The proportion of participants who reported local reactions, were similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2. A 
higher proportion of participants reported systemic events and antipyretic/analgesic medication use 
after Dose 2 than Dose 1. 
The incidence of any AE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 ranged from 5.2% (US Lot 3) to 10.4% 
(EU Lot).  
There was a total of 2 SAEs (1 participant who experienced an AE of exposure during pregnancy 
followed by an SAE of spontaneous abortion and 1 participant who experienced status migrainosus), 
both of which were severe, but neither were assessed by investigator or the MAH as related to the 
study vaccine.  
There were 2 participants who received US Lot 2 who were diagnosed with COVID-19, defined by the 
MAH as AEs of special interest, with onset between Dose 1 and Dose 2 (mild to moderate severities). 
There were no cases of MIS-C. 
Lymphadenopathy from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 was reported by 1 participant who received 
US Lot 1, 3 participants who received US Lot 2, 1 participant who received the EU Lot, and 2 
participants who received 20 μg of US Lot 1 (Arm 5).  
Two participants were withdrawn for safety-related reasons, 1 of which had AEs assessed by the 
investigator as related to the investigational product (dermatitis and angioedema) and the other 
participant was withdrawn because of pregnancy.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The main aim of the study was to demonstrate lot consistency of vaccine batches manufactured at different 
sites. The lot consistency of different vaccine batches was demonstrated in means of ability to induce 
antibody responses at similar scale. Similar antibody levels were demonstrated and therefore there is no 
concern of fluctuating quality between manufacturing sites. In total, 445 paediatric subjects (28% of the 
study population) aged 12-17 years were included in the study. For the primary immunogenicity (GMR) 
analyses in participants 12-50 years of age, there were no analyses specific to paediatric participants 
12-17 years of age. For the secondary immunogenicity (GMC) analyses, the age specific immunological 
response was evaluated. The results showed that in the 12–17-year-old age group, antibody levels were 
twice as high than in older age groups as one may expect in light of the previous experience with Comirnaty 
and also with other vaccines.  
The safety results are in agreement with previously reported studies. The size of the study population was 
not large enough to detect rare AEs and SAEs. No new safety concern is raised from this study. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.

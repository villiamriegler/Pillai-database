2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Memantine ratiopharm 5 mg; 10 mg; 15 mg; 20 mg film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product 
of Ebixa 5 mg; 10 mg; 15 mg; 20 mg which has been authorised in the EU since 15 May 2002. 
The active substance of Memantine ratiopharm is memantine hydrichloride, a psychoanaleptic, anti-
dementia drug (N06DX01). Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity non-competitive N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, modulating the effects of pathologically elevated 
tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal dysfunction. 
The safety and efficacy profile of memantine has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of 
which can be found in the EPAR of Ebixa. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience 
contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic 
application referring to the reference product Ebixa, summary of the clinical data is available and no 
new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety have to be 
conducted, which was considered acceptable. 
The approved indication is: Treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
The indication proposed for Memantine ratiopharm is the same as authorized for the reference 
medicinal product. Proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use as 
per the SmPC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Memantine ratiopharm is presented as film-coated tablets containing 5 mg; 10 
mg; 15 mg; 20 mg of memantine as the active substance. The composition is described in section 6.1 
of the SmPC. 
The product is available in Alu/Alu blisters or HDPE bottles as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance memantine (as hydrochloride) or 1-Amino-3,5-dimethyl tricycle (3,3,1,13,7) 
decane hydrochloride, 3,5-Dimethyl-1-adamantamine HCl, 1-Amino-3,5-dimethyl adamantane HCl is a 
white, crystalline powder, soluble in water and methanol, practically insoluble in acetone. 
It is a non-hygroscopic substance. Memantine contains two stereocenters. It has a symmetry axis C2 
and a symmetry plane, therefore it is achiral. 
The active substance is consistently obtained as a single polymorphic form.  
The elucidation of the structure of Memantine hydrochloride has been confirmed by Elemental analysis, 
IR, UV, 1H & 13C NMR, XRPD, DSC & Mass spectrum. The results are all-consistent with the chemical 
Memantine ratiopharm 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 5/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structure assigned. All DSC peaks show that a single polymorphic form is present and that no change 
could be observed after storage. 
A comprehensive discussion has been presented regarding impurities including potential genotox 
impurities and residual solvents. The limits remained below the ICH limits and therefore no safety 
concern is expected. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure from two suppliers within the current manufacturing authorisation application. 
Manufacture 
The information on the manufacturing process of the active substance is provided in the restricted part 
of the ASMF provided for both manufacturers.  Memantine hydrochloride is synthetised in 5 steps 
including the salt formation using well-defined commercially available starting materials. 
The synthetic process and the starting materials used in the manufacture of the active substance are 
sufficiently described by both suppliers. Critical steps and intermediates are presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and 
reagents have been presented.  Both suppliers established satisfactory control on the manufacturing 
process of memantine hydrochloride through adequate in–process and intermediates specifications. 
Information regarding process validation has also been presented and considered acceptable. Batch 
analysis data confirm the active substance is manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
The finished product manufacturer set up a specification that is a combination of the specifications of 
the 2 active substance manufacturers. The specification includes the following parameters: appearance 
(visual), solubility, clarity and colour of solution (Ph.Eur.), pH, identification (IR, and chloride method), 
water content (Ph.Eur. 2.5.12), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur. 2.4.14), chloride content (titration, Ph.Eur. 
2.2.20), assay (titration, Ph.Eur. 2.2.20), related substances (GC in-house), related substances (GC, in 
house), residual solvents (GC, in-house), particle size (laser in-house ) 
The specification from the finished product manufacturer is suitable to control the quality of 
memantine. The analytical methods have been described and the in-house methods have been 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Two Certificates of analysis of memantine obtained from each ASMF supplier and issued by the 
proposed finished product manufacturer were presented, confirming compliance with the proposed 
specification. 
Stability 
For the first active substance manufacturer, 12 pilot batches of memantine packed in the commercial 
package were put on ICH long term (25°C/60%RH, up to 5 years) and accelerated  (40°C/75%RH, 6 
months) stability studies.  
The following parameters were tested: clarity and colour of solution, pH, loss on drying, related 
substances and assay. The analytical methods were the same as those used for release testing. 
All the available results are within specifications (accelerated and long term studies) and no significant 
trends are observed. Stress stability studies were conducted under heat, acidic, alkaline, and oxidative 
conditions, No significant degradation could be observed apart from oxidative conditions 
Memantine ratiopharm 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 6/19 
 
 
 
 
For the second ASMF supplier, 3 pilot batches (only 2 batches for the accelerated studies) of 
memantine packed in commercial package were put on ICH long term (25°C/60%RH, up to 36 
months) and accelerated  (40°C/75%RH, 6 months) stability studies.  
The stability samples are tested for appearance, water content, assay by titration, chlorides content 
and purity & related substances by GC. The analytical methods and the specifications are those applied 
at release. 
All the available results were within specifications (accelerated and long term studies) and no 
significant trends are observed. 
In conclusion, based on the available stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions 
by each supplier when the active substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials are 
considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The objective was to develop a tablet formulation containing memantine that is essentially similar to 
the reference product Ebixa film-coated tablets. The manufacturing process retained after different trial 
formulations was a process by direct compression. 
The active substance memantine hydrochloride is classified as a highly soluble drug substance (BCS 
class I).  In addition, parameters such as water content, and particle size of the active substance were 
studied and controlled during the pharmaceutical development and their results were consistent for 
both manufacturers.  
With regard to polymorphism, DSC thermograms and XR-diffractograms of consecutive batches 
confirmed the same crystalline form is used in the manufacturing process.  
The first prototypes formulations were evaluated for dissolution profiles compared to the reference 
product. In order to improve dissolution, these formulae were further optimized for the composition. 
Satisfactory dissolution and stability at 40°C/75%RH were achieved with the final formulation. 
Memantine Hydrochloride 5, 15 and 20mg tablet cores are dose proportional to memantine 
Hydrochloride 10mg tablet cores. Similar dissolution profiles for the 5, 15 & 20mg tablets versus 
reference Ebixa tablets were demonstrated. 
The dissolution profiles at all the pH media including QC medium for product release between the 
Memantine ratiopharm and Ebixa film-coated tablets are similar for all dosage strengths. Pilot batches 
of the drug product show dissolution of more than 85% within 15 minutes. The discriminative power of 
the dissolution method is deemed demonstrated with different prototype trial formulae, proposed 
formula and reference product. 
The chosen excipients are widely used for this immediate-release dosage form, and they are 
microcrystalline cellulose and lactose anhydrous as filler, pregelatinised starch as disintegrant/binder, 
magnesium stearate as lubricant, white film-coating powder Opadry  including partial hydrolysed 
polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, talc, lecithin, xanthan gum and purified water as coating solvent 
and polysorbate 80 as wetting agent. All the excipients are of compendial grade. There are no 
compatibility concerns with the proposed excipients, as is demonstrated in long-term and accelerated 
testing and supporting compatibility screening studies of binary mixtures. The excipients used are 
Memantine ratiopharm 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 7/19 
 
 
 
 
 
standard pharmacopoeial excipients for solid oral dosage forms. Opadry is not described in any 
pharmacopoeia but the individual ingredients are.  
The formulation used during the bioequivalence study (biobatch V00407002; 120 000 tablets) is the 
same as the final formulation used for marketing. 
Bioequivalence study was therefore performed showing bioequivalence between the European 
Reference Product (Ebixa) and the proposed commercial formulation. 
The primary packaging proposed is PVC/PVdC/Alu blister or HDPE bottle. The materials comply with 
Ph.Eur. requirements. Stability studies have been performed and confirm the appropriateness of the 
packaging. 
Adventitious agents 
The only material from animal origin is lactose. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk 
from healthy animal in the same conditions as those used to collect milk for human consumption and 
the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to 
the current Note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy 
agents via human and veterinary medicinal products. No TSE risk is foreseen. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacture of Memantine ratiopharm film-coated tablets is a standard process and can be 
summarised in the following main steps: blending and sifting of the ingredients, mixing, compression, 
coating of the tablets, packaging.  
Appropriate in-process controls such as assay, density, uniformity of weight, hardness have been 
applied during the manufacture of the tablets. 
A process validation protocol at pilot scale has been provided as well as validation results on three pilot 
batches for the 5 and 10mg tablets. Results showed that the tablets could be manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification. The first three commercial batches 
will be produced and subjected to validation as outlined in the validation protocol.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specification for Memantine ratiopharm 5, 10, 15 & 20mg 
film-coated tablet include the appropriate tests for description (visual), identification of memantine (IR 
and HPLC), identification of colorant, average weight, uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur. 2.9.40), 
water content (Karl-Fischer), assay (HPLC), related substances (GC), dissolution (Ph. Eur. 2.9.3), 
microbial contamination (Ph.Eur. 2.6.12 and 2.6.13).  
Analytical methods were described and for non pharmacopoeial methods, description and validation 
reports were presented. 
Batch results on four pilot batches of Memantine ratiopharm of each strength produced at Ratiopharm 
using the active substance from the two proposed suppliers confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
manufacture, and indicate that the process is under control. The limits for the related substances 
remained within the ICH limits and raised no safety concerns.

Stability of the product 
Stability of four pilot batches of each strength kept in the commercial packaging (blisters or bottles) 
stored under ICH long term (up to 48 months at 25°C/60%RH), and accelerated conditions (6 months 
at 40°C/75%RH) were presented. The parameters tested were identical to those from the finished 
product specification. All results were in compliance with the specifications. There were no significant 
trends observed. The analytical methods used were stability indicating.  
Stability data of 2 batches of bulk coated tablets of each strength stored for 6 months at 25°C/60%RH, 
30°C/65%RH or 40°C/75%RH revealed no significant changes. 
In-use stability study were performed on 2 pilot batches of 5, 10 & 20mg tablets packed in open HDPE 
bottles and stored for 6 months at 25°C/60%RH. The tested parameters were appearance, identity, 
water content, assay and degradation products, dissolution and microbial purity. No trend in stability 
was observed during storage in open bottles, except for moisture content that increased. The product 
should be kept in the closed packaging to protect it from moisture.  
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life, the in-use shelf life and the storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information and development, manufacture, and control of the active substance and the finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of the tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a uniform and satisfactory performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been provided to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable further to the applicant clarification in its 
answer to the List of Questions.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Memantine ratiopharm manufactured by Ratiopharm GmbH is considered unlikely to 
Memantine ratiopharm 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 9/19 
 
 
 
 
 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all memantine containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar 
and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Memantine ratiopharm from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is a generic application for film-coated tablet containing memantine. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with cross-over design 
under fasting conditions with the 10mg strength (study n°70303 and study n°120087). Study 120087 
was the pivotal study for the application and study 70303 was supportive. The applicant applied for a 
biowaiver for the additional strengths (5mg, 15mg, and 20mg). 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. 
For the clinical assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1) in its current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr **) if the pharmacokinetic of the active substance is linear and that the bioequivalence is 
demonstrated for one strength, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the other strengths could be waived. 
An exemption from the requirement to perform bioequivalence studies would be justified when the 
following conditions are met: the pharmaceutical products have the same manufacturer, same 
qualitative composition, same ratio between active substance and excipients and in vitro dissolution 
profile comparable to the reference product. 
A biowaiver was applied for the 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg strengths. The applicant provided tabular 
listing of the composition of the four strengths. Similarity factors were not calculated as more than 
85% of the drug was dissolved within 15 minutes at all pH values tested. According to literature 
(Robinsons and Keating, 2006) the dose/plasma concentration relationship is linear over the range of 
10-40 mg. During the procedure the applicant provided published data which demonstrated PK 
linearity over the range 5mg-40mg (FDA website). During the procedure, the applicant also provided 
the comparative dissolution profiles at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 of the four strengths for the batches used in 
both BE studies. 
Based on these results, the CHMP concluded that the general biowaiver criteria were met. Therefore, 
one bioequivalence study and a biowaiver for the additional strengths were considered adequate.

Clinical studies 
To  support  the  application,  the  applicant  has  submitted  two  bioequivalence  studies,  neither 
pharmacodymanic studies, nor therapeutic equivalence studies. The applicant conducted a first pivotal 
bioequivalence  study  with  cross-over  design  under  fasting  conditions  with  the  10 mg  strength  (study 
n°70303).  However  during  the  assessment  it  was  observed  that  an  incurred  sample  reanalysis  was 
missing in the bioanalytical method part of the study. The validation of the analytical method used was 
therefore  not 
in  accordance  with 
the  Guideline  on  Bioanalytical  method  validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009).  As  the  plasma  samples  were  not  available  anymore  for  a  reassay, 
the  applicant  repeated  the  study  (study  n°120087).  Thus  this  study  was  considered  pivotal  for  the 
application and the results of the initial study were considered supportive.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Study 70303 
Methods 
Study design 
Study 70303 was a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, bioequivalence study of memantine 
10 mg tablet and Ebixa (reference) following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. 
It was conducted with Ratiopharm GmbH, as sponsor, from 29/08/2007 to 18/10/2007.

Blood samples were collected at 0.00 (pre-dose), 1.00, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 
7.00, 8.00, 10.0, 12.0, 14.0, 24.0, 48.0, 72.0, 144, 216, 288 and 360 hours following drug 
administration in each period. The two periods were separated by a wash-out period of 35 days. 
Memantine was analysed in plasma. 
Test and reference products  
Memantine ratiopharm 10mg manufactured by Ratiopharm, Pvt. Ltd. (batch No. V00407002, 
manufacturing date: 04/2007; exp. date 04/2008) has been compared to Ebixa 10mg manufactured 
by H. Lundbeck-A/S (Batch No: 609451, exp. date 08/2010.). 
Populations studied 
Based on data from previous studies, the intra-subject coefficients of variation should be 
approximately 10% and 16% for AUC and Cmax, respectively. Thus, with these expected coefficients of 
variation and an expected ratio of AUC and Cmax within 0.90 and 1.11, the study should have a power 
of at least 85% to show bioequivalence with 28 subjects.  
In order to account for possible dropouts, a total of 32 healthy adult subjects (16 males and 16 
females) aged between 18-55 years were included into the study. Thirty-one (Subject n° 11 excluded) 
completed both treatment periods of this study and have been included in the statistical analysis. 
Subject n°11 was withdrawn from the study in Period I due to positive urine drug screen 
(benzodiazepine). 
Analytical methods 
The  plasma  concentrations  of  memantine  in  the  study  samples  were  quantified  by  a  validated 
LC/MS/MS method after a liquid-liquid extraction using memantine-d6 as the internal standard. 
The analytical method used has been shown to be sensitive, accurate and selective for the plasma level 
determination of memantine in the concentration range of 0.101-20.144 ng/mL. The lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) was 0.101 ng/mL of plasma. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the drug-concentration-time profile by non-
compartmental model.  
Pharmacokinetics: AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Residual area, Tmax, T1/2 el and Kel. 
Statistical methods   
ANOVA was performed on ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.  
ANOVA was also carried out on the untransformed data of T1/2 el and Kel. 
A  non-parametric  test  (Wilcoxon's  Signed-Rank  test)  was  carried  out  to  compare  the  Tmax  between 
treatments. Ratios of least-squares means and 90% geometric confidence intervals were calculated for 
ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.  
Inter and intra-subject CVs were also calculated.

Bioequivalence of Test Product-A vs. Reference Product-A was concluded, if the 90% geometric 
confidence intervals of the ratio of least-squares means for ln-transformed AUC 0-t and Cmax were within 
the acceptable range of 80% and 125%.

Safety data 
A total of 43 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 19 of the 32 subjects who 
received at least one dose of the study medication (safety population). Twenty-three adverse events 
were reported by 40.6% (n=13) of the 32 subjects who received the test product and 20 adverse 
events were reported by 35.5% (n=11) of the 31 subjects who received the reference product. Of the 
43 post-dose adverse events reported, 34 were graded as mild and 9 were graded as moderate. The 
most commonly reported adverse event was "Somnolence" reported by 18.8% (n=6) of subjects who 
constituted the safety population (n=32). No deaths or serious adverse events were reported during 
the conduct of the trial.

Test and reference products  
Memantine ratiopharm 10 mg manufactured by TEVA India private Ltd, Goa for Ratiopharm GmbH 
(batch No. 3120018, manufacturing date 04/2012; exp. date not available, retest date: 04/2015) has 
been compared to Ebixa 10 mg manufactured by H. Lundbeck A/S, Denmark (Batch No: 153287, exp. 
date 05/2015). 
Populations studied 
Based on data from literature, the intra-subject CVs should be 10% and 16% for AUC and Cmax, 
respectively. Thus, with these expected CVs and an expected ratio of AUC and C max within 0.95 and 
1.05, with an alpha error of 5%, the study should have a power of at least 90% to show BE with 18 
subjects. In order to account for possible dropouts, 24 healthy subjects (10 females and 14 males) 
were included in the study. All subjects completed the study and were included in the safety 
population. 
Some protocol deviations in the blood sampling schedule occurred during the study (11 samples were 
taken with over 30 mn delay and 1 sample was not obtained). 
Analytical methods   
Pharmacokinetics: 
• Parametric ANOVA on AUC0-72 and Cmax; geometric confidence intervals for AUC0-72 and Cmax; and 
non-parametric test (Wilcoxon) for Tmax; 
• Factors in the ANOVA model: sequence, subject within sequence, period, and treatment; 
• Ln-transformed parameters: AUC0-72 and Cmax. 
Criteria for bioequivalence for memantine: 90% geometric confidence intervals of the ratio (A/B) of 
least-squares means from the ANOVA of the ln-transformed AUC0-72 and Cmax should be within 80.00% 
to 125.00%.

25.0% (n=6) of subjects who constituted the safety population. Of the 21 TEAEs reported, 19 were 
graded as mild and 2 were graded as moderate. No deaths, serious or significant AEs were reported 
during this study. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Memantine ratiopharm is considered bioequivalent with 
Ebixa. 
The results of study 120087 with the 10mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 5mg, 
15mg and 20mg, according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 4.1.6. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In this application no new efficacy or safety data were submitted which was considered acceptable. The 
applicant provided an acceptable review of clinical trial published in literature, describing the efficacy 
and safety profile of Memantine Ratiopharm. No new dose recommendations compared with the 
reference product were made for this generic application. 
Bioequivalence study 70303 
The applicant conducted a first open-label, single-dose, randomised, 2- way crossover study, under 
fasting conditions with the 10 mg strength. The study design, population chosen, sample size, and 
statistical methods were well described and appropriate according to the Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). However, no incurred sample reanalysis 
was reported as the study was performed before the current guideline was available. Nevertheless, this 
is now a regulatory requirement in the European guideline (Questions & Answers EMA/618604/2008 
Rev. 6, 10 December 2012). Therefore the applicant was requested to provide the ISR of a scientific 
justification for the lack of ISR. 
The 90% confidence intervals around the geometric means ratio T/R for memantine were in the 
acceptance range of 80-125% for the primary parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax. The AUC derived 
from the measurements is at least 80% of the AUC extrapolated to infinity. The median values of Tmax 
were sufficiently similar for test and reference product. These results were considered as supportive. 
Bioequivalence study 120087 
Further to the major objection on the lack of ISR, as the samples were no longer available, the 
applicant submitted during the procedure a new bioequivalence study including an ISR analysis (study 
n°120087) in the validation of the bioanalytical method. Study 120087 was an open-label, randomized, 
two-way, single oral dose, crossover BE study with the 10 mg strength, under fasting conditions. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr **) the study design was appropriate for an immediate release product. This Guideline states that 
the bioequivalence study should in general be conducted at the highest strength, however for products 
with linear pharmacokinetics and where the drug substance is highly soluble as it is the case for 
memantine, selection of a lower strength than the highest is also acceptable. Hence, one 
bioequivalence study with the 10 mg strength was considered appropriate to establish bioequivalence. 
Since memantine may be taken with or without food according to the SmPC of the reference medicinal 
product, a study under fasted conditions was adequate. Taking into account the terminal half-life 
ranges from 60 to 100 hours for memantine, the sampling scheme and the wash-out period were 
considered appropriate. The determination of sample size was based on a power of at least 90%, an 
alpha level of 0.05, a T/R ratio between 95-105% and a low within-subject CV based on in-house 
estimates, this was acceptable. The reported deviations were minor and considered not to affect the 
results and conclusions of the study as the accurate sampling times were used in the analysis. 
This new bioequivalence study was conducted according to the Note for Guidance on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence, CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1. The analytical and statistical methods were well 
described and appropriate. A total of 100.00% of the reanalysed samples (96 samples) met the criteria 
of assay reproducibility.  
The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of geometric means were well in the acceptance range of 
80-125% for the primary parameters AUC0-72 and Cmax.

Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that the test product (Memantine ratiopharm 10 mg 
film-coated tablets) is bioequivalent to the reference product (Ebixa 10 mg film-coated tablets). The 
test and reference product were found to be clinically comparable in their safety profile. 
Additional strengths biowaiver 
The general biowaiver criteria were met and the pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range is 
linear. Therefore, a biowaiver for the strengths 5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg is adequate. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based  on  the  submitted  bioequivalence  studies  and  the  presented  additional  strength  biowaiver, 
Memantine  ratiopharm  10  mg  and  20mg  film-coated  tablets  are  considered  bioequivalent  with  Ebixa 
10mg and 20mg film-coated tablets. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Summary of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Summary of the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the 
applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.  
Risk management plan 
The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because there are no safety 
concerns with the reference medicinal product, which has led to additional risk minimisation activities, 
beyond routine risk minimisation activities. 
PSUR submission 
The CHMP considered that PSUR submission is not required for generics of this active substance. 
However, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this 
medicinal product if the product were to be included in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) 
provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines 
web-portal. 
User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Memantine hydrochloride 10mg/ml. The bridging report 
submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of memantine film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Ebixa is indicated in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. No 
nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a 
clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient.

The bioequivalence study 120087 forms the pivotal basis with a single centre, open-label, single-dose, 
randomised, 2- way crossover design, under fasting conditions with the 10 mg strength. The study 
design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with 
the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well 
as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Memantine ratiopharm met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence 
when compared with Ebixa. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-72 and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 
to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the benefit-
risk balance of Memantine ratiopharm in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s 
disease is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Benlysta 
belimumab 
On 19 September 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Benlysta. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is GlaxoSmithKline (Ireland) 
Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2  
“Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients aged 5 years and older with active, 
autoantibody- positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity 
(e.g., positive anti dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy (see section 5.1)”. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

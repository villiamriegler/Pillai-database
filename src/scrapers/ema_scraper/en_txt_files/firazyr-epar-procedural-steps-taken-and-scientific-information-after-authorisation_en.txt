Update of Risk Management Plan (RMP) in order to

n/a 
In total, there were seven shifts in reproductive hormones 
reflect the finalisation of the paediatric study HGT-
FIR-086, update the main safety concerns following 
results of the paediatric study HGT-FIR-086 and 
remove study HGT-FIR-086 as an additional PV 
activity. In addition the RMP was reformatted to 
comply with the requirements of the new EU RMP 
template. The requested variation proposed 
amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing

and/or limits of the finished product - Change 
outside the approved specifications limits range 
categories at any time point, most of them transient. Three 
of the seven shifts occurred in testosterone levels in 
pubertal/post-pubertal males after the second and third 
exposures. In this subgroup, shifts were noted both from 
normal to low (n=1) and from low to normal range values 
(n=2). Thus, there were no clear trends in the observed 
shifts. The shifts observed in other reproductive hormones 
were transient. It is considered that the changes in 
reproductive hormones in the study are not clinically 
relevant, and do not raise any concern. The number of 
subjects in the study was however low, especially in the 
second phase, and furthermore, there were a substantial 
number of missing values for reproductive hormones. In 
summary, even though no clinically meaningful shifts in 
reproductive hormones were seen in the study, no firm 
conclusions could be made due to the low number of 
observations. No medication errors were reported in the 
study, neither with administration by health care personnel 
or by the subject’s caregiver. Based on these results no 
update on the information already reflected in section 5.1 
was deemed necessary. The RMP was updated to reflect the 
fulfilment of Study HGT-FIR 086. Furthermore, the RMP 
was updated according to the new EU RMP format and to 
include update of exposure data, update of the safety 
concerns “Effect on reproductive hormone levels in 
pubertal/ post-pubertal children” and “Medication Errors” 
and addition of data from a preclinical study.

Results from the double-blind, randomised, placebo-

This submission concerns grouping of two type II 
variations to include additional information on the 
impact of icatibant on fertility-related parameters: 
-  
Update of SmPC section 4.6 with information 
on results of a phase I randomised double-blind, 
placebo controlled single centre study to assess the 
effects of icatibant on serum reproductive hormone 
levels and semen analysis in male and 
premenopausal female healthy adult subjects.

Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
controlled phase I study HGT-FIR-062 in male and 
premenopausal female healthy adult subjects showed some 
statistically significant changes in the levels of reproductive 
hormones at some time points after icatibant 
administration, but those were assessed as unlikely to have 
unfavourable reproductive effects and therefore as not 
being clinically significant. There were no significant effects 
of icatibant on semen parameters in males. 
In the 7-week GLP toxicity study, in male juvenile rats 
microscopic findings in testes and epididymides, which 
were partially reversible, were seen at doses of 3, 9 or 25 
mg/kg/day subcutaneously. However, the effects seen in 
the present study at 3 and 9 mg/kg/day did not result in 
any functional deficit in terms of mating performance and 
fertility of the male rat, which also is in line with previous 
fertility studies where no effect was seen in rats at a top 
dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Impaired fertility in male juvenile 
rats was seen at 25 mg/kg/day, but In view of the results 
from the clinical study it is agreed that the effects seen on 
male fertility at 25 mg/kg/day is not relevant to the 
prescriber. A no-observed-adverse-effect-level for female 
rats of 9 mg/kg/day was established. 
The findings from these two studies were deemed not to 
affect the positive benefit-risk balance of icatibant and 
information about important findings has been added to the 
SmPC.

of hereditary angioedema (FAST 3). 
The MAH had also conducted a comprehensive analysis of 
adverse events in the increased safety database. The list of 
adverse reactions has been updated accordingly. Due to 
lack of evidence to support a likely causal relationship, the 
following AEs have been removed: blood creatinine 
phosphokinase increased, prothrombin time prolonged, 
vomiting, asthenia, fatigue, contusion, weight increased, 
blood glucose increased, hyperuricaemia, hyperglycaemia, 
muscle spasm, proteinuria, asthma, cough, nasal 
congestion, generalised urticaria, and hot flush. 
SmPC section 4.7 has been revised according to the 
updated list and frequencies of adverse reactions that may 
have an effect on ability to drive or use machines.

The MAH has conducted a 6-months chronic toxicity study 
the non-clinical findings from the chronic toxicology 
Annex II 
in rats and a 9-months study in dogs, which have been 
studies in rats (JE049-0163) and dogs (JE049-0164).

45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
assessed as follow-up measures. As an outcome of the 
assessment, the MAH was requested to submit a type II 
variation to include relevant information from these studies 
in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. Effects of icatibant 
treatment observed in both rats and dogs included a dose 
related reduction in circulating sex hormone levels, and the 
repeated use of icatibant reversibly delayed sexual 
maturation. Furthermore, adrenal gland hypertrophy was 
seen in rats, the clinical relevance of which is unknown.

Summary of Risk Management Plan for DUAVIVE 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for DUAVIVE. The RMP details 
important risks of DUAVIVE, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about DUAVIVE’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
DUAVIVE’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how DUAVIVE should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for DUAVIVE should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
DUAVIVE’s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
DUAVIVE is authorised for the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in 
postmenopausal women with a uterus (with at least 12 months since last menses) for whom 
treatment with progestin-containing therapy is not appropriate (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains conjugated oestrogens and bazedoxifene acetate as the active 
substances and it is given by orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of DUAVIVE’s benefits can be found in 
DUAVIVE’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/duavive. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of DUAVIVE, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about DUAVIVE 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of DUAVIVE is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of DUAVIVE are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of DUAVIVE. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

groups 
Risk factors for VTEs include age, diabetes, smoking, obesity, varicose veins, 
high blood pressure, immobility, trauma, surgery, cancer, cancer therapy, 
neurological disease with extremity paresis, and selected concomitant 
medications.  In the BAvarian ThromboEmbolic Risk (BATER) study, a 10-year 
observation cohort study of 4337 women (age 18–55 years; mean age 26 ± 8.6 
years), increased age, personal history of VTE, family history (of VTE, varicose 
veins or MI), and increased BMI ( 25 kg/m2) were found to be risk factors for 
VTE.

Important Potential Risk: Arterial thromboembolic events: 
Cerebrovascular events and myocardial infarction (MI) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
In clinical trials of up to 2 years duration, no increased risk of stroke was observed 
in women treated with CE/BZA.   
Oestrogens alone have been associated with an increase in the risk of stroke. In the 
WHI oestrogen-alone sub-study, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke 
was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE 0.625 mg-alone 
compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 
10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and 
persisted. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased 
risk of stroke for those women receiving CE 0.625 mg-alone versus those 
receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).  
In clinical trials of bazedoxifene 20 mg, no increased risk of stroke was observed 
in postmenopausal women. 
There was no evidence of a significant increase in MI in the CE/BZA treatment 
groups in the Phase 3 clinical studies compared with placebo.  However, an 
increased risk of CHD (including MI and coronary death), was observed with 
treatment with combined CE 0.625 mg/ MPA 2.5 mg in the WHI study.  
Myocardial infarction is listed as an ADR observed with CE monotherapy in 
Section 4.8 of the CE/BZA SmPC.    
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The incidence of stroke increases dramatically with age. Other risk factors for 
stroke include elevated blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, smoking, diabetes, and 
TIA.  
Risk factors for MI include age (≥ 45 years for men and ≥ 55 years for women), 
hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, elevated total cholesterol, 
low HDL, smoking, high alcohol consumption, and elevated triglycerides, along 
with genetic and dietary factors.

male rat specific finding of renal tumours resulting from bazedoxifene related 
corticomedullary nephrocalcinosis, in conjunction with enhanced spontaneous 
chronic progressive nephropathy in a 2-year repeat dose study.   
Risk factors include age, race (with Native Americans having the highest reported 
rates and those of Asian descent the lowest), smoking, obesity, family history, 
workplace exposures, hypertension, and advanced kidney disease requiring 
dialysis.

groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
There was no evidence of any significant increase in the relative risk of breast 
cancer in the CE/BZA treatment groups compared with placebo in the CE/BZA 
Phase 3 clinical studies.  However, breast cancer is included as a potential risk 
with CE/BZA due to overall evidence suggesting an increased risk of breast 
cancer in women taking combined oestrogen-progestin and possibly oestrogen-
only HRT, that is dependent on the duration of HRT therapy.  In the WHI Studies, 
the 95% CI for the HR for CE vs PBO included 1, but there was nominally 
statistically significant increase in the risk of breast cancer with CE/MPA vs PBO 
(HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.59).  
Well established risk factors for breast cancer include advanced age, family 
history, genetic mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2, atypia in a benign biopsy and 
reproductive factors (including age at menarche, parity and age at birth of first 
child).  Other potentially important factors include mammographic density, plasma 
oestrogen and androgen levels, bone density, height and age at menopause.  
Behavioural risk factors include overweight/obesity, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol 
consumption and, possibly, dietary factors. Use of the SERMs, tamoxifen and 
raloxifene, decrease the risk of invasive breast cancer in post-menopausal women. 
Data from the WHI clinical study oestrogen + progestin and oestrogen alone arms 
suggest that new-onset breast tenderness during use of oestrogen + progestin was 
associated with increased subsequent breast cancer risk.  The association of 
oestrogen + progestin therapy with increased breast cancer risk was especially 
pronounced in women with baseline breast tenderness.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
There was no evidence of any significant increase in the relative risk of ovarian 
cancer in the CE/BZA treatment groups compared with placebo in the CE/BZA 
Phase 3 clinical studies.  However, ovarian cancer is included as a potential risk 
with CE/BZA due to data reported for CE, administered with or without progestin.   
There are numerous published reports describing a relationship between 
endometriosis and the development of ovarian cancer, although the specific risk 
factors and pathogenesis remain unclear (for example, reviewed in the following). 
Although endometriosis is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age, 
endometriosis may persist in the abdominal cavity after menopause.  Since 
endometriosis is an oestrogen dependent disorder, there is a theoretical possibility 
that use of postmenopausal hormones such as SERMs may affect the potential for 
malignant transformation.

There was no evidence of any significant increase in the relative risk of 
endometrial cancer in the CE/BZA treatment groups compared with placebo in the 
CE/BZA Phase 3 clinical studies.  However, endometrial cancer is included as a 
potential risk for CE/BZA due to the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and 
carcinoma associated with the use of unopposed oestrogens in women with an 
intact uterus. 
Risk factors for endometrial cancer include old age, Caucasian race, obesity, type 
II diabetes, lack of physical activity, low parity, early menarche, greater age at 
menopause, family history, and use of hormone therapy. The incidence of 
endometrial cancer is relatively low and varies somewhat by geography.  
Incidence is highest in North America and Northern Europe, intermediate in 
Eastern Europe and Latin America, and lowest in Africa and Asia.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
There was no evidence of any significant increase in the relative risk of lung, 
thyroid, skin, GI or other cancers in the CE/BZA treatment groups compared with 
placebo in the CE/BZA Phase 3 clinical studies.  Lung, thyroid, skin, GI and other 
cancers is included as a potential risk for CE/BZA as all cancers are considered to 
be a potential risk for BZA monotherapy. 
Lung Cancer 
Although tobacco smoking is known to be the major cause of lung cancer, other 
risk factors have also been identified, including environmental and occupational 
exposure to carcinogens, human papillomavirus, chronic inflammatory disease and 
family history. Studies have suggested that sex hormones may influence lung 
cancer risk and females and males show differences in lung cancer types, 
incidence and survival.  
Thyroid cancer 
Risk factors for thyroid cancer include age, female sex, head or neck irradiation 
during childhood, and history of goiter.  
Skin Cancer 
Exposure to ultraviolet light is a major cause of melanomas. People with certain 
risk factors are more likely than others to develop skin cancer. Risk factors vary 
for different types of skin cancer, but some general risk factors are having the 
following:  
•  A lighter natural skin color. 
•  Family history of skin cancer. 
•  A personal history of skin cancer. 
•  Exposure to the sun through work and play. 
•  A history of sunburns early in life. 
•  A history of indoor tanning. 
•  Skin that burns, freckles, reddens easily, or becomes painful in the sun. 
•  Blue or green eyes. 
•  Blond or red hair. 
•  Certain types and a large number of moles. 
GI Tract Cancer 
A number of epidemiological studies have suggested that Helicobacter pylori 
infection increases the risk of some gastric cancers (distal noncardia gastric 
cancer).  Other risk factors associated with gastrointestinal cancers are 
Gastrointestinal Reflux Disease and Barrett’s Disesase, tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, diet, nutrition and obesity, however, the differences in incidence 
rates between men and women have not been explained.  It has been suggested 
that the female sex hormones may modulate gastric cancer risk.

There was no evidence of any significant increase in the risk of endometrial 
hyperplasia in the CE/BZA treatment groups compared with placebo in the 
CE/BZA Phase 3 clinical studies.  However, endometrial hyperplasia is included 
as a potential risk for CE/BZA due to the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and 
endometrial carcinoma associated with the use of unopposed oestrogens in women 
with an intact uterus. 
A separate study, in the same managed care population used by Reed et al, 
identified two risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia: obesity and nulliparity. 
Both are known risk factors for endometrial carcinoma and are believed to 
influence the body’s balance of oestrogen and progestin.

•  Post Authorization Safety Study (PASS) of DUAVIVE in the United States 
(B2311060).  The primary objective is to estimate and compare the incidence rates of 
endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women 
initiating either DUAVIVE or oestrogen+ progestin hormone therapy. The secondary 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
objective is to estimate and compare the incidence rates of the selected secondary 
safety endpoints: (venous thromboembolism [VTE], coronary heart disease (defined 
as myocardial infarction [MI] and sudden death), stroke, breast cancer, ovarian 
cancer, thyroid cancer, renal cancer and adenoma, gastrointestinal cancer, all cancer, 
and all-cause mortality) among postmenopausal women initiating either DUAVIVE 
or oestrogen+ progestin hormone therapy. 
•  Drug Utilization Study (DUS) of DUAVIVE in the European Union (B2311061). 
[Final Study Report Submitted on 31 March 2020]  
The study was a multi-country, drug utilization study based on secondary data analysis of 
existing data sources.   The overall aim of the study is to describe the baseline characteristics 
of EU patients initiating treatment with either DUAVIVE or oestrogen + progestin hormone 
replacement therapy (E+P HRT), and to describe the utilization patterns of DUAVIVE. 
The study objectives are: 
1. Within each participating EU country, to describe and compare baseline characteristics and 
medical history between DUAVIVE and E+P HRT patients in EU.   
2.  To estimate the proportion of patients that may have been prescribed DUAVIVE outside 
the specifications of the authorised product information (‘off-label use’). 
The study setting is comprised of electronic healthcare records collected in the outpatient 
setting from the following EU countries: Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and 
the UK. Data from the first 3 years after DUAVIVE availability in the EU are included from 
31 March 2016 through 30 March 2019.   
Based on the available data, it can be concluded that the number of patients who initiated 
treatment with DUAVIVE in all included countries is very low.  When DUAVIVE was 
prescribed, it was most often prescribed in an appropriate population (i.e., female patients, 
mostly 50 years or older, correct indication) and in the dosage recommended in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Based on these data, overall prescribing patterns were 
comparable between DUAVIVE and E+P HRT.  Potential off-label use ranged from 9% 
(France) to 29% of patients (Spain), and was primarily comprised of use in women who were 
≤ 45 years of age. It is very important to note that the age threshold of 45 years is a proxy 
measure for premenopausal status. The results of this study suggest the proportion of 
potential off-label use of DUAVIVE is low in clinical practice.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ponatinib, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported in ponatinib treated 
patients. A cumulative review in previous PSUSA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010128/201606) identified 16 
events of possible PRES from post-marketing sources. None of them were fatal. Among them, three cases 
reporting PRES were identified, of these one was confirmed and two indicated positive de-challenges; 
however, based on the case details provided it was considered that the evidence was not sufficiently 
strong to update the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); PRES was included as a potential risk 
in the RMP and the MAH updated the Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS). 
Hypertension including hypertensive crisis is a known complication with ponatinib treatment and may 
further contribute to the risk of PRES. Furthermore, inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 
(VEGF) have previously been associated with PRES in the literature (Tlemsani et al. Target Oncol. 2011 
Dec;6(4):253-8; Tirumani et al. RadioGraphics 2015; 35:455–474). Ponatinib has shown activity against 
the VEGFR families of kinases supporting a possible association between the drug and the event. 
During the current reporting period, two new cases of PRES have been reported, adding to a cumulative 
total of 5 cases of PRES. One of the cases reported in the current reporting period was confirmed by 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), included a possible temporal relationship and a positive de-
challenge. Therefore, taken together the biological plausibility, the cases reported post-marketing and the 
seriousness of the events of PRES, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of 
medicinal products containing ponatinib were warranted to reflect the risk of posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).   
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ponatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ponatinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Summary of the risk management plan Rixathon / 
Riximyo (rituximab)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Rixathon  / 
Riximyo,  a  biosimilar  to  MabThera.  The  RMP  details  important  risks  of 
Rixathon  /  Riximyo,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more 
information  will  be  obtained  about  Rixathon’s  /  Riximyo’s  risks  and 
uncertainties (missing information).
Rixathon’s  /  Riximyo’s  summaries  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and 
their package leaflets give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how Rixathon / Riximyo should be used.
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Rixathon  /  Riximyo  should  be  read  in  the 
context  of  all  this  information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the 
evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in 
updates of Rixathon’s / Riximyo’s RMP.

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks
Important risks of Rixathon / Riximyo, together with measures to minimize 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Rixathon’s / 
Riximyo’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on 
correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and 
healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
•
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen 
so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the 
patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its 
risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of Rixathon / Riximyo, these measures are supplemented with 
additional risk minimization measures mentioned under relevant important 
risks below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is 
collected continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, 
so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Rixathon / Riximyo 
is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Rixathon  /  Riximyo  are  risks  that  need  special  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that 
the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which

there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Rixathon / Riximyo. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing 
and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Infections (including serious infections) are listed in section 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and section 4.8 
Undesirable effects of the SmPC MabThera and are therefore 
considered as an important identified risk of GP2013.
Patients are at risk who present with a history of recurring or 
chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious infection.
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8; section 4.4 where 
recommendation for exercising caution when considering the 
use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or 
chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious infection is included
PL section 2 and in PL section 4 Possible side effects 
recommendation to reach out to the doctor immediately if 
there are signs of an infection including fever, cough, sore 
throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or 
generally unwell is included
Legal status: Prescription only

PML is listed in section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions 
for use and section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the SmPC 
MabThera and is therefore considered as an important 
identified risk of GP2013.
There are currently no known risk groups or risk factors for 
the development of PML associated with rituximab.
PML general occurs in patients with suppressed cellular 
immunity.
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8; section 4.4 where 
recommendation for monitoring of patients at regular 
intervals and suspension of further dosing if PML is 
suspected, in case of doubt considering further evaluation 
including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological 
assessments and permanently discontinuing dosing of 
Rixathon / Riximyo if a patient develops PML is included
PL section 4 Possible side effects recommendation to reach 
out to the doctor immediately if there are signs of an 
infection including memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty 
walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, 
serious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive 
Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML) have been included.
Legal status: Prescription only

indication):

All indications: Important identified risk ‘Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation’

HBV reactivation is listed in section 4.4 Special warnings and
precautions for use and section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the 
SmPC
MabThera and is therefore considered as an important 
identified risk
of GP2013.
The majority of patients developing a HBV reactivation during
treatment with rituximab were also exposed to 
chemotherapy.
Pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA level and the use of steroids 
were also
considered as risk factors.
Routine risk minimization measures:

Hypogammaglobulinemia is listed in section 4.4 Special

identified risk
of GP2013.
RA:
Patients with low immunoglobulin level at baseline had an 
increased
tendency to hypogammaglobulinemia.
Pemphigus vulgaris, GPA and MPA:
No specific risk factor could be identified

NHL/CLL: Important potential risk ‘Administration route error’

Risk minimization 
measures
As per SmPC MabThera, it is important to check the medicinal 
product
labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation (intravenous 
or
subcutaneous formulation) is being given to the patient, as 
prescribed.
Administration route error is therefore considered as potential 
risk of
GP2013.
Patients treated for NHL or CLL
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC section 4.2
PL section 3
The outer carton as well as the vial label of the product 
states: For
intravenous use after dilution.
Legal status: Prescription only
Additional risk minimization measure:
HCP alert card
GPA and MPA: Important potential risk ‘Relapses’
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Relapses have been observed in patients with GPA or MPA 
(SmPC MabThera) and are therefore considered as potential 
risk of GP2013.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Irbesartan Teva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. 
It is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 
diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. 
Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control 
than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in 
haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of irbesartan can be increased to 
300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). In 
particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive 
effect with irbesartan (see section 4.5). 
In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily 
and titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease.  
The demonstration of renal benefit of irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on 
studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach 
target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose 
(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no 
clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Elderly population  
Although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of 
age, dose adjustment is not usually necessary for elderly people. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Teva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. Currently 
available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
•  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed insection 6.1. 
•  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6). 
•  The concomitant use of Irbesartan Teva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 
and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Intravascular volume depletion 
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or 
sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such 
conditions should be corrected before the administration of irbesartan. 
Renovascular hypertension 
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral 
renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is not documented with 
irbesartan, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation 
When irbesartan is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium 
and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of 
irbesartan in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. 
Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease 
The effects of irbesartan both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all 
subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In 
particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects (see section 5.1). 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including 
acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin 
II receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy. 
Hyperkalaemia 
As with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia 
may occur during the treatment with irbesartan, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt 
proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in 
patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hypoglycaemia 
Irbesartan may induce hypoglycaemia, particularly in diabetic patients. In patients treated with insulin 
or antidiabetics an appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of 
insulin or antidiabetics may be required when indicated (see section 4.5). 
Lithium 
The combination of lithium and irbesartan is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral 
stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Primary aldosteronism 
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products 
acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of irbesartan is not 
recommended. 
General 
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal 
disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or 
angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, 
azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any antihypertensive agent, 
excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular 
disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin 
antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see 
section 5.1). 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless 
continued AIIRAs therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to 
alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if 
appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Paediatric population 
Irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the current data are 
insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become available (see 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Excipient 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents 
Other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however irbesartan 
has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting 
calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in 
volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan (see section 4.4). 
Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics 
Based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, 
concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing 
potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may 
lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Lithium 
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects 
have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended 
(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is 
recommended. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), 
attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.   
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an 
increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in 
serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should 
be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Repaglinide 
Irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that irbesartan 
increased the C max and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 1.3-fold, 
respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose 
adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). 
Additional information on irbesartan interactions 
In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan 
is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant 
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when irbesartan was coadministered 
with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as 
rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of 
digoxin was not altered by coadministration of irbesartan. 
Aliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors 
Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) 
through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated 
with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal 
function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Inhibitors (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRAs 
therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (see section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see also 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
Because no information is available regarding the use of irbersartan during breast-feeding, irbesartan 
is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during 
breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3). 
Fertility 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing 
the first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness 
or weariness may occur during treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
In placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did 
not differ between the irbesartan (56.2 %) and the placebo groups (56.5 %). Discontinuation due to 
any clinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3 %) than 
for placebo-treated patients (4.5 %). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the 
recommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. 
In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic 
dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5 % of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in 
excess of placebo. 
The following presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials in 
which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the 
adverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2 % of diabetic hypertensive patients with 
chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. 
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Adverse reactions additionally reported from post–marketing experience are also listed. These adverse 
reactions are derived from spontaneous reports.

Investigations 
Very common:   Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan 
than with placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and 
normal renal function, hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4 % of the 
patients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22 % of the patients in the placebo

group. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt 
proteinuria, hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3 % of the patients in the 
irbesartan group and 26.3 % of the patients in the placebo group. 
 significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7 %) in 
irbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with 
identifiable clinical musculoskeletal events. In 1.7 % of hypertensive patients with 
advanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in 
haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been observed. 
Paediatric population  
In a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following 
adverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9 %), hypotension (2.2 %), 
dizziness (1.9 %), cough (0.9 %). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent 
laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5 %) and elevated CK values in 2 % of 
child recipients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
Experience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most 
likely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might 
also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with 
irbesartan. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and 
supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal 
may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. 
ATC code: C09C A04 
Mechanism of action 
Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is 
expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source 
or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors 
results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma 
aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at 
the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates 
angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require 
metabolic activation for its activity. 
Clinical efficacy 
Hypertension 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Irbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is 
dose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of 
150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by 
an average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. 
Peak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood 
pressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood 
pressure was 60-70 % of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended 
doses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice 
daily dosing on the same total dose. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect 
occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during long 
term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. Rebound 
hypertension has not been observed. 
The efficacy of irbesartan is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal 
products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less 
response to irbesartan monotherapy. There is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or 
urinary uric acid secretion. 
Paediatric population 
Reduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target 
titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of 
hypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the 
three weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic 
blood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mm Hg (low dose), 9.3 mm Hg (medium dose), 13.2 mm Hg (high 
dose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough 
seated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mm Hg (low dose), 3.2 mm Hg (medium 
dose), 5.6 mm Hg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized 
to either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mm Hg 
in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mm Hg changes respectively in those on all doses of 
irbesartan (see section 4.2). 
Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease 
The “Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)” shows that irbesartan decreases the progression 
of renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double 
blind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing irbesartan, amlodipine and placebo. In 1,715 
hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/day and serum creatinine ranging 
from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of irbesartan on the progression of renal 
disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg to a maintenance 
dose of 300 mg irbesartan, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as tolerated. Patients in all 
treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e.g., diuretics, beta 
blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of ≤ 135/85 mm Hg or a 
10 mm Hg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mm Hg. Sixty per cent (60 %) of 
patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was 76 % and 
78 % in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced the relative 
risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
or allcause mortality. Approximately 33 % of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary 
renal composite endpoint compared to 39 % and 41 % in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20 % 
relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23 % relative risk reduction compared to 
amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were analysed, no 
effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in ESRD and a 
significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum 
creatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black 
subgroups which represented 32 % and 26 % of the overall study population respectively, a renal 
benefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary 
endpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups 
in the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a 
decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebobased 
regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the 
irbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart 
failure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in 
women has been identified. 
The study of the “Effects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 
Diabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)” shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in 
patients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in 
590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function 
(serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term 
effects (2 years) of irbesartan on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin 
excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30 % from baseline). The 
predefined blood pressure goal was ≤ 135/85 mm Hg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding 
ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added 
as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all 
treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2 %) than in the placebo (14.9 %) 
or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7 %) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 
70 % relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying 
improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of 
treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months 
and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more 
frequent in the irbesartan 300 mg group (34 %) than in the placebo group (21 %). 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. 
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D 
was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE- inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of 
approximately 60-80 %. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability 
of irbesartan.  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding is approximately 96 %, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. 
The volume of distribution is 53-93 litres.  
Biotransformation 
Following oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85 % of the circulating plasma 
radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via 
glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide 
(approximately 6 %). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome 
P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. 
A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal 
recommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations 
are attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 
and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. 
Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing 
regimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20 %) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily 
dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female 
hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of 
irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values 
were also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). 
However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in 
elderly people. 
Elimination 
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV 
administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20 % of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the 
remainder in the faeces. Less than 2 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration 
of single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for 
four weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults 
(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC 
and clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan 
daily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18 %) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily 
dosing. 
Renal impairment 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not 
significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In 
non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in 
macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). 
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial 
nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and 
creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the 
hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, 
irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in 
macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the 
pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. 
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at 
oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including 
mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live 
foetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. 
Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. 
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
Animal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, 
hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, 
abortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including 
mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Irbesartan Teva is and what it is used for 
Irbesartan Teva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.  
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing 
them to tighten.  This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Teva prevents the binding of 
angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.  
Irbesartan Teva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 
diabetes.      
Irbesartan Teva is used in adult patients 
 
 
to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) 
to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory 
evidence of impaired kidney function. 
2.

if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics.  
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:

  diabetes-related kidney problems 
- aliskiren 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Irbesartan Teva”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Teva is not 
recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).   
Children and adolescents 
This medicinal product should not be given to children under 18 years of age because the safety and 
efficacy have not yet been fully established. If a child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor 
immediately. 
Other medicines and Irbesartan Teva

medicines. 
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:

Irbesartan Teva” and “Warnings and precautions”). 
You may need to have blood checks if you take:

 
 
potassium supplements 
salt substitutes containing potassium 
potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) 
medicines containing lithium 
repaglinide (medication used for lowering blood sugar levels) 
If you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan 
may be reduced.   
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Your doctor will 
normally advise you to stop taking Irbesartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you

depending on blood pressure response. 
Patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease 
In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg once daily is the preferred 
maintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease. 
The doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as 
those on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years. 
The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment. 
If you take more Irbesartan Teva than you should: 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Irbesartan Teva 
If you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal.  Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose.

This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
 What Irbesartan Teva is and what it is used for 
Irbesartan Teva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.  
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing 
them to tighten.  This results in an increase in blood pressure.  Irbesartan Teva prevents the binding of 
angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.  
Irbesartan Teva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 
diabetes.      
Irbesartan Teva is used in adult patients  
 
 
to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) 
to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory 
evidence of impaired kidney function. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Teva 
Do not take Irbesartan Teva 
 
if you are allergic to irbesartan or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid Irbesartan Teva in early 
pregnancy - see pregnancy section). 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Teva and if any of the following apply to you: 
 
 
 
 
If you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea 
If you suffer from kidney problems   
If you suffer from heart problems   
If you receive Irbesartan Teva for diabetic kidney disease.  In this case your doctor may 
perform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor 
kidney function   
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
If you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics   
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have  
  diabetes-related kidney problems 
- aliskiren 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Irbesartan Teva”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Irbesartan Teva is not 
recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).   
Children and adolescents 
This medicinal product should not be given to children under 18 years of age because the safety and 
efficacy have not yet been fully established. If a child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor 
immediately. 
Other medicines and Irbesartan Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: 
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take 
Irbesartan Teva” and “Warnings and precautions”). 
You may need to have blood checks if you take: 
 
 
 
 
 
potassium supplements 
salt substitutes containing potassium 
potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) 
medicines containing lithium 
repaglinide (medication used for lowering blood sugar levels) 
If you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan 
may be reduced.   
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Your doctor will 
normally advise you to stop taking Irbesartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you 
know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Teva.  
Irbesartan Teva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 
months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.   
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Irbesartan Teva is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.   
Driving and using machines 
49 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Irbesartan Teva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, occasionally 
dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure.  If you experience these, 
talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. 
Irbesartan Teva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
 How to take Irbesartan Teva 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
Method of administration 
Irbesartan Teva is for oral use.  Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of 
water).  You can take Irbesartan Teva with or without food.  Try to take your daily dose at about the 
same time each day. It is important that you continue to take Irbesartan Teva until your doctor tells 
you otherwise. 
 
 
Patients with high blood pressure  
The usual dose is 150 mg once a day. The dose may later be increased to 300 mg once daily 
depending on blood pressure response. 
Patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease 
In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg once daily is the preferred 
maintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease. 
The doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as 
those on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years. 
The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment. 
If you take more Irbesartan Teva than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately.   
If you forget to take Irbesartan Teva 
If you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal.  Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose.   
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

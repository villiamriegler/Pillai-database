The indication proposed by the applicant is largely agreed and includes pre-symptomatic LI-MLD 
and EJ-MLD and a description of early symptomatic MLD EJ-MLD. However, for clarity, it has been 
specified that patients should only have early clinical manifestations of disease. .............147
Importantly, Reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC is made as this section includes a more 
elaborate description of the MLD subvariants, and the definition of early symptomatic. ....147
The data suggests that in early symptomatic EJ MLD the cognitive function appears to be 
preserved when treated before the onset of cognitive decline. Thus, treatment may be beneficial 
to preserve cognitive function, while the effect on deterioration of motor function may be limited 
to a decline in rate of deterioration. This information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC 
as well as treatment of symptomatic LI appears not effective as deterioration in line with normal 
disease progression is observed. ..............................................................................147
To allow more rapid treatment of patients, the applicant initially proposed to use a 2-stage release 
testing strategy, in which product identity (presence of transgene) and potency would not be 
confirmed to administration. ....................................................................................147
After evaluation of the available data, it was concluded that it is not justified to maintain the 2-
stage release strategy as this is accompanied by a risk of administering a sub-potent medicinal 
product which may lead to a suboptimal treatment effect, and that retreatment with a new batch 
is not possible for the patient.  The change to a conventional (1-stage) release strategy will, 
however, result in a 3-4 week longer time interval between screening and treatment compared to 
the clinical studies. Even if the risk of deterioration of the patient’s clinical status between 
screening and treatment because of this delay could be low, it is preferable to treat the patients as 
early as possible. Therefore, the applicant is required to reduce the time from screening to 
treatment towards the ranges used during clinical development within 1 year following approval. 
Reduction of the time needed for product testing and batch release should be part of the measures 
to achieve this. ......................................................................................................147

1.  Background information on the procedure
1.1.  Submission of the dossier
The applicant Orchard Therapeutics (Netherlands) B.V. [Orchard] submitted on 8 November 2019 an 
application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Libmeldy through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1a.
Libmeldy, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/07/446 on 13 April 2007 in the following 
indication: Treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:
Treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) in patients from birth to before 17 years and in older 
patients for whom disease onset occurred before 17 years.
Treatment with Libmeldy should be performed before the disease enters its rapidly progressive phase.
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Libmeldy as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/libmeldy
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies).
Information on Paediatric requirements
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0222/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0222/2016 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred.
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity
Similarity
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

The Scientific Advices pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects:

The proposed approach to process performance qualification (PPQ) and comparability for the vector 
manufacturing process, drug substance and drug product process; the proposed test methods for 
GSK3484865 (starting material), GSK2696274 (drug substance) and GSK2696274 Dispersion for 
Infusion (drug product), including the two stage drug product release strategy; definition of the 
active substance; the proposal of a two stage release strategy and the test methods for 
GSK2696274 (drug substance) and cryopreserved GSK2696274 Dispersion for Infusion (drug 
product); the proposed identity testing of GSK3484865 lentiviral vector; the strategy for PPQ to 
demonstrate commercial process consistency for the manufacture of drug substance and drug 
product; the proposed release strategy; sufficiency of the proposed design and number of stability 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 10/157
 
 
studies to support the proposed commercial cryopreserved product shelf life.

The proposed comparability studies with the current fresh formulation and a new cryopreserved 
formulation and need of additional non-clinical studies prior to a later clinical trial with the 
cryopreserved formulation; sufficiency of the comparability exercise to conclude whether product 
manufactured using the proposed commercial manufacturing processes is comparable to that 
produced using the clinical production process.

Appropriateness of the non-clinical package for MAA; adequacy of the biodistribution data to support 
the MAA; the design of the proposed non-clinical toxicity and tumorigenicity study. 
 Whether it would be acceptable to submit the MAA with a 2 year (rather than 3 year) endpoint and 
without the final report of the GLP toxicity and tumorigenicity study.
 Design of the proposed phase I/II study, including patient selection, endpoints, sample size, early 
stopping rules/put on hold criteria; adequacy of the safety database for MAA; possibility of MAA 
submission based on 3 year follow-up efficacy and safety data in nine patients with late infantile and 
early juvenile MLD, who were treated in the asymptomatic or early symptomatic stages; whether 
treatment of all paediatric MLD patients (i.e. actual or predicted onset of symptoms at or below the 
age of 16 years, including asymptomatic LI and asymptomatic or early symptomatic juveniles) 
would be supported by an extrapolation strategy, based on efficacy in the youngest children with the 
most aggressive forms of the disease; whether the medical need in adults with MLD is separate and 
distinct from that in children and adolescents younger than 16 years, and thus supports limiting the 
target population to those with actual or predicted onset of symptoms under the age of 16; the 
proposed statistical analysis plan for the phase I/II study; the strategy for MAA submission for pre-
symptomatic Late Infantile MLD; the revised MAA submission strategy, to file the cryopreserved 
formulation by first intent; appropriateness of the proposed patient population of predominantly pre-
symptomatic Late Juvenile MLD and the enrolment criteria defined for Study 206790 to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy in Late Juvenile MLD; sufficiency of the endpoints selected for Study 206790 to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy in Late Juvenile MLD patients; the proposed approach for external 
control groups to contextualise the results of Study 206790; the statistical analysis plan and sample 
size proposed for Study 206790; sufficiency of the duration of Study 206790 and follow-up period 
for the proposed endpoints; adequacy of the clinical development programme to support approval in 
the treatment of all pre-symptomatic paediatric MLD patients (LI, EJ, LJ and Intermediate below 16 
years of age).

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder 
caused by mutations in the Arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene that results in deficiency of its corresponding 
enzyme. 
The applicant initially sought approval of Libmeldy for the following indication: 
 “treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) in patients from birth to before 17 years and in older 
patients for whom disease onset occurred before 17 years.
Treatment should be performed before the disease enters its rapidly progressive phase”
During the assessment the indication was changed to the following:
Libmeldy is indicated for the of treatment metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by biallelic 
mutations in the arysulfatase A (ARSA) gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic activity:
- in children with late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease,
- in children with the early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have the 
ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline (see section 5.1).
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
MLD is pan-ethnic, with affected patients described in several populations (including European, Japanese, 
Jewish, Lebanese, Muslim Arab, South African, Iranian, Indian, Polynesian, Algerian, Habbanite Jew, Navajo 
Indian, Alaskan Eskimo, and Christian Arab) (Von Figura, 2001).
A paucity of published MLD epidemiology data makes it difficult to accurately estimate the global 
prevalence/incidence of MLD; however, a systematic review of available literature has revealed approximately 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 13/157
 
 
1.1 cases (all MLD variants) per 100,000 livebirths in the European Union (EU) (Heim, 1997, Hult, 2014, 
Lugowska, 2011, Pinto, 2004, Poorthuis, 1999, Stellitano, 2016). This figure may be higher in areas or 
communities of the world in which consanguineous marriage is more common (Bindu, 2005, Harvey, 1993, 
Heinisch, 1995, Von Figura, 2001, Zlotogora, 1980). Furthermore, European studies suggest that 
approximately 40% to 60% of patients have the LI variant, 20% to 40% have the juvenile variant (early 
juvenile [EJ] + late juvenile [LJ]), and approximately 18% to 20% have an adult variant (Gieselmann, 2010, 
Gomez-Ospina, 2006, Heim, 1997, Ługowska, 2005, Poorthuis, 1999).
2.1.3.  Biologic features
MLD is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the ARSA gene 
that results in deficiency of its corresponding enzyme. ARSA breaks down cerebroside 3 sulfate (sulfatide), a 
major component of oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell myelin membrane in the central nervous system 
(CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), respectively. ARSA deficiency results in accumulation of the 
undegraded substrate in lysosomes of oligodendrocytes, microglia, certain neurons of the CNS, Schwann cells 
and macrophages of the PNS, and other non-neural tissues (e.g., gallbladder, liver, pancreas, and kidneys). 
Accumulation in the nervous system, in turn, leads to microglial damage, progressive demyelination, 
neurodegeneration, and subsequent loss of motor and cognitive functions and early death, especially in 
patients with early disease onset (Bergner, 2019, Gieselmann, 2010, van Rappard, 2015). Therefore, ARSA 
deficiency, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and microglia activation as a result of sulfatide 
accumulation are key components of the common disease pathophysiology across the MLD clinical spectrum.
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation
The MLD disease spectrum can present in a variety of clinical forms primarily based on the arbitrary criterion 
of age of onset of the first symptoms of the disease, rather than biological and clinical parameters which 
widely overlap across the disease spectrum. There is no universally accepted classification system for MLD 
phenotypes and at least three clinical forms of the disease are commonly described (LI-MLD, Juvenile MLD, 
and Adult MLD) (Kolodny, 1995, Von Figura, 2001). Despite this standard classification into different clinical 
phenotypes, it is well known that the underlying disease pathophysiology described above is common for all 
phenotypic forms of MLD. The arbitrary classification of MLD is particularly applicable to the stratification of 
juvenile forms into early and late juvenile.
Genetic mutations leading to MLD, can be functionally divided into 2 broad groups: null (0) alleles associated 
with no enzymatic activity and R alleles encoding for ARSA with some residual enzymatic activity (see 
Figure 1). The 3 most frequent variants reported to cause a partial or total disruption of the ARSA enzymatic 
activity and lead to MLD are the splice donor site variant “null allele” c.465+1G>A (traditionally named 
459+1G>A), frequently found in LI-MLD patients and the missense “R allele” variants c.1283C>T 
(traditionally named 1277C>T) and c.542T>G (traditionally named 536T>G), usually found in association 
with a juvenile or adult phenotype. At least two hundred MLD-related ARSA mutations have been described, 
the frequency of which differs within ethnic groups (Cesani, 2016). 
For illustrative purposes only, Figure 1 displays a simplified version of the relationship and boundaries 
between genotype/phenotype of MLD variants. The standard classifications of MLD variants are arbitrary due 
to the overlap in time course, symptomatology, age of onset, genotype, and progression rate between 
variants. Regardless of the clinical classification, the clinical course of the disease can be broadly divided into 
a pre-symptomatic stage with normal motor and cognitive development, followed by onset of first symptoms 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 14/157
 
 
and a period of developmental plateau, which is short in early onset forms and longer and more variable in 
late onset forms. The disease inevitably ends in a decerebrated state and eventually death for all phenotypic 
forms of the disease, although its course and duration are highly variable (Biffi, 2008a, Elgün, 2019, van 
Rappard, 2015).
Figure 1:
Simplified MLD Genotype-Phenotype Relationship 
ARSA= arylsulfatase A; MLD=metachromatic leukodystrophy; O=null allele; R=allele with residual enzyme activity
Patients who are clinically classified with the LI-MLD usually carry 2 null alleles (0/0 genotype) and hardly 
express any residual ARSA activity, resulting in symptoms manifestation before 30 months of age. LI MLD is 
the most prevalent MLD variant and the most aggressive form of the disease showing a highly predictable 
and severe disease course, characterised by progressive decline in motor and cognitive function and an early 
death (Gieselmann, 2010, van Rappard, 2015). 
The phenotypic variability is particularly evident in the juvenile and adult variants that have at least one R 
allele, which results in some residual ARSA enzymatic activity to partially metabolise sulfatide and, thus, 
leads to a slower accumulation of undegraded substrate in the central and peripheral nervous systems 
(Rauschka, 2006, Sevin, 2007). The variability is observed in terms of clinical presentation, age at disease 
onset, and dynamics in the rate of disease progression (Biffi, 2008a, Lugowska, 2005, Polten, 1991).
In particular, patients who are affected by the Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD variant carry either 1 null allele and 1 
residual allele (0/R genotype), or less frequently two residual alleles (R/R genotype), have symptom onset 
between the ages of 30 months and 6 years of age (before their 7th birthday), and tend to have slower and 
more variable initial disease progression.
Late Juvenile MLD variants (age/projected age at disease onset ≥7 years and <17 years) , on the other hand 
carry either two residual alleles (R/R genotype) or less frequently 1 null allele and 1 residual allele (0/R 
genotype) and predominantly develop cognitive and behavioral symptoms before or simultaneously with 
deterioration of gait and motor function (Biffi, 2008a, Gieselmann, 2010).
A study by Mahmood et al that was conducted via a retrospective analysis of MLD cases since 1921 showed 
that the 5-year survival after symptom onset was 25% and the 10-year survival was 0% for LI patients. 
However, since 1970, increased survival rates in a vegetative state have been observed, likely due to 
improvements in supportive care. For juvenile patients (mean age of diagnosis 10 years), 5- and 10-year 
survival rates were 70% and 44%, respectively (Mahmood, 2010). 
EMA/584450/2020

2.1.5.  Management
There is currently no curative treatment for MLD. 
Available treatments only address the symptoms of the disease and none of them have proven to reverse the 
fatal outcome.
Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used for the treatment of MLD but 
results available so far have been inconsistent and associated with risks for serious complications, such as 
graft-rejection, graft versus host disease (GVHD) or complications derived from intense conditioning 
regimens. Given the more rapid progression in early onset MLD variants, the use of HSCT has been 
particularly limited to MLD patients with late-onset variants where, considering the associated risks of 
conditioning and those secondary to allogenic transplantation (GVHD, engraftment failures), the benefit risk 
profile remains to be determined.
Other investigational approaches are currently being tested in clinical trials such as intrathecal enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT).
Also, a Chinese Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT03725670) using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector TYF-ARSA is 
ongoing; in this study, the investigational gene therapy is administered to MLD patients. Of note, a clinical 
trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of intracerebral in vivo gene therapy with adeno-associated vectors 
expressing ARSA (Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT01801709) has been recently discontinued (Schiller, 2019).
2.2.  About the product
Libmeldy is an ex vivo genetically modified autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell gene 
therapy. Autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are collected from patient 
bone marrow (BM) harvest or from mobilised peripheral blood (mPB) and transduced with a lentiviral vector 
(ARSA LVV), which inserts one or more copies of the human ARSA complementary deoxyribonucleic acid 
(cDNA) into the cell’s genome so that genetically modified cells become capable of expressing the functional 
ARSA enzyme. When administered to the patient following the administration of a myeloablative conditioning 
regimen, the genetically modified cells engraft and are able to repopulate the haematopoietic compartment.  
A subpopulation of the infused HSPCs and/or their myeloid progeny is able to migrate across the blood brain 
barrier to the brain and engraft as central nervous system (CNS) resident microglia and perivascular CNS 
macrophages as well as endoneural macrophages in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).  These genetically 
modified cells can produce and secrete supraphysiological levels of the ARSA enzyme, which can be taken up 
by surrounding cells, a process known as cross-correction, and used to break down or prevent the build-up of 
harmful sulfatides.
2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice
Scientific Advice was obtained from SAWP on 9 occasions between April 2009 and February 2018 on the 
overall development of Libmeldy and to agree on key elements of the quality, nonclinical and clinical studies 
to be conducted. The Scientific Advice written reports, as well as minutes of the pre-MAA meeting with EMA 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 16/157
 
 
and Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur meetings conducted in 2019, are provided in Annex 5.14 to the Application 
form.
Design of the pivotal clinical Study 201222 was first discussed with the Scientific Advice Working Party 
(SAWP) during a Scientific Advice held in 2009 [EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/2009/PA/PED/ADT/III] in which 
agreement on the main efficacy and safety endpoints was sought. In particular, the SAWP agreed that the 
design of this Phase I/II study, i.e. a non-randomised and open-label study, was adequate to address the 
efficacy and safety of Libmeldy, given the rarity of the disease and the orphan status of Libmeldy. The SAWP 
also agreed that untreated MLD patients from the SR-TIGET NHx study was an appropriate comparator, 
provided “these historical controls match the treated population with respect to disease stage, age and 
genotype”.
In addition, during a Scientific Advice held in 2018 [EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/5/2017/PA/PED/ADT/II] the 
design of a study in LJ-MLD population to be conducted with Libmeldy was discussed. The SAWP indicated 
that “a comparison with matched sibling appears to have the least variability” and that “comparison between 
presymptomatic subjects versus their affected siblings is considered the most informative”. These comments 
are consequently also applicable to Study 201222 and the Integrated Data Set (Study 201222 and EAPs).
The use of historical controls as comparators was also discussed during the Co-Rapporteur meeting with AIFA 
during which recommendation was made to clarify that due to ethical considerations, only early symptomatic 
patients were included in the NHx study; however retrospective data were collected on each individual 
patient in order to reconstruct as far as possible the dynamics of the disease. A matched-sibling analysis was 
recommended to be included in the dossier by the assessors along with information on sample size and 
percentage of missing data at each time point for both treated and untreated subjects.
This advice has been followed by the applicant.
The SAWP agreed with Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM) as a primary efficacy endpoint in Study 
201222 and recommended to include ARSA activity as a co-primary endpoint. Selected safety endpoints to 
monitor the safety profile of the treatment procedure were endorsed by the SAWP. Long-term follow-up was 
also integrated in the protocol, as recommended by the SAWP. Additional discussions occurred with the SAWP 
on the design of the pivotal study in 2014 [EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/1/2014/ADT/III]. At the time of this 
Scientific Advice, the proposed sample size consisted of 8 LI and 4 EJ subjects and the plan to submit an MAA 
supported by an Interim Analysis performed when nine subjects complete their 3-year follow-up visit was 
discussed. The SAWP considered the proposed sample size to be sufficiently homogeneous and reminded the 
applicant that “the sample size was more dependent on the condition and not so on statistical requirements.” 
The SAWP also stated that the proposed interim analysis could be acceptable provided demonstration of a 
clear outstanding positive benefit/risk profile in this population at 3 years post-treatment. Long-term follow-
up of the clinical subjects was also recommended and consequently followed by the applicant. Overall, the 
applicant’s proposed study design was deemed acceptable for a registrational study supporting a marketing 
authorisation provided recommendations stated above from the SAWP were implemented in the protocol. The 
applicant confirms that the protocol was amended accordingly. Of note, the sample size and proportion of 
pre-symptomatic LI and pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic EJ subjects were revised multiple times 
during the course of the study with the final design intended to treat a total of 20 subjects. 
Extrapolation of the benefit-risk profile of Libmeldy as studied in the LI and EJ population to the LJ MLD 
variant was discussed in the frame of several Scientific Advice [EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/1/2014/ADT /III; 
EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/2/2015/PA/PED/ADT/II; EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/5/2017/PA/PED/ADT/II]. The SAWP 
commented that "Any argument around extrapolation should consider similarity of disease across different 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 17/157
 
 
phenotypes and similarity of drug effects across phenotypes (considering the mechanism of action in relation 
to disease progression). It should also be considered that benefit-risk considerations may differ between 
populations with different prognosis, progression and severities or disease” 
[EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/1/2014/ADT/III].
In 2017, during the discussion on the design of a study in LJ patients, the SAWP highlighted that "It is not 
ruled out that robust positive results from Study 201222 in pre-symptomatic LI and EJ MLD patients and an 
acceptable safety profile, could support use in pre-symptomatic subjects with more slowly progressive 
phenotypes which have essentially the same mechanism of disease”. Additionally, during the review of the 
PIP [EMEA-001765-PIP02-15], the PDCO commented that if Libmeldy “proves to be efficacious in children 
with the most severe forms of MLD, it is likely that its benefit-risk balance is also positive in patients with 
milder forms of the disease.”
The applicant changed the formulation from a fresh formulation to a cryopreserved formulation. With regard 
to the clinical data generated with this cryopreserved formulation (Study 205756), the SAWP mentioned 
during the Scientific Advice held in April 2017 [EMEA/H/SA/1224/1/FU/4/2017/PA/PED/ADT/III] that “as 
there would be data on biomarkers needed for good clinical response from the fresh formulation (e.g. ARSA 
activity), it would be possible to endorse similarity with the modified cryopreserved formulation based on 
surrogate variables rather than having to wait for robust clinical outcomes”.
Type of Application and aspects on development
The CAT and CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on an unmet medical need in claimed 
indication, and the expectation that the product would address the unmet medical need in the target 
population. Considering the severity and irreversibility of the disease, and the fact that this decline can be 
very rapid in some patients, delayed access will deprive pre-symptomatic and early-symptomatic (LI and EJ) 
MLD patients of a potentially curative/successful treatment. As such assessment within an accelerated time 
was recommended. 
However, during assessment the CAT and CHMP reverted the evaluation to a standard timetable as the 
indication, the release testing strategy, and a few other concerns were still under discussion at day 150. 
2.4.  Quality aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
Libmeldy (also referred to as OTL-200) is an ex vivo autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cell gene 
therapy aiming at correcting the genetic defect in metachromatic leukodystrophy patients’ own 
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Administration of Libmeldy is via intravenous infusion. Libmeldy 
should only be administered once.
The finished product is presented as a cryopreserved dispersion for infusion containing 2-10 x 106 of CD34+ 
enriched cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) 
gene.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 18/157
 
 
Other ingredients are: 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 7% human serum albumin 
(HSA).
The finished product is composed of one or more infusion ethylene vinyl acetate bags (50 mL EVA bag). Each 
infusion bag contains 10 to 20 mL of finished product.
2.4.2.  Active Substance
 General Information
Libmeldy is a gene therapy medicinal product containing an autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that 
contains haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding 
the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene. The active substance (AS) is considered as a new active substance in 
itself. The predicted transgene amino acid sequence has been provided (see section on LVV below).
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the gene therapy retroviral vector 
(ARSA LVV) and part 2 for the transduced cells resulting in the active substance (CD34+ transduced cells).
1) ARSA LVV - LENTIVIRAL VECTOR
General information (LVV)
ARSA LVV is a recombinant replication-defective third generation pseudotyped self-inactivating (SIN) HIV-1 - 
based  lentiviral  vector  that  has  been  modified  to  carry  the  human  ARSA  cDNA  sequence.  The  vector  is 
pseudotyped with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus envelope glycoprotein G (VSV-G), thus wildtype HIV cannot 
be generated by recombination among the constructs used to make vectors. The vector is designed to integrate 
the transgene in the target cells (autologous CD34+ cells) with minimal risk of generating Replication Competent 
Lentivirus (RCL) and maximising gene transfer efficiency by optimisation of construct design.
The provided general information on the LVV is considered adequate and sufficient.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturer (LVV)
The applicant has provided information on the manufacture of the vector. The facilities used in the 
manufacture of the vector are GMP compliant.
Description of the manufacturing process and process control (LVV)
An appropriate description of the LVV manufacturing process has been provided. 
For each step of the proposed commercial manufacturing process a summary, process parameters, and IPCs 
performed have been provided. Open manipulations of process material are performed in a grade A clean area 
(biosafety cabinet) by operators trained in aseptic technique using standard operating procedures.
Briefly, the process consists of cell expansion, transient transfection with the transfer vector plasmid (pARSA) 
and  the  packaging  plasmids  (pKG,  pKrev,  pKLgagpol)  in  the  presence  of  transfection  reagents,  followed  by 
incubation, harvest, clarification and pooling of the harvests. Pooled harvest is purified, sterile filtered, filled 
and frozen. Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been identified and are controlled for each step. 
LVV  is  manufactured  in  Cell  Factories.  The  harvested  material  from  the  Cell  Factories  is  clarified,  purified, 
concentrated and the buffer is exchanged, prior to final fill. 
Control of Materials (LVV)
Raw materials (LVV)
An  overview  of  the  raw  materials  used  for  LVV  manufacturing  is  provided,  including  information  on  the 
manufacturer and specifications. 
Starting materials (LVV)
The information provided for plasmid manufacturing and control is generally in line with the expectations. The 
plasmids are manufactured in accordance with the principles of GMP and testing is in agreement with Ph. Eur. 
5.14 requirements. (including identity, genomic integrity, plasmid DNA, host cell DNA, endotoxin and sterility). 
The cells used for the LVV manufacturing can be considered standard production cells for various viral vectors, 
including LVV, used for gene therapy. The manufacture and testing of the MCB is described in sufficient detail. 
Testing,  including  adventitious  agents  testing  is  generally  in  agreement  with  Ph.  Eur.  5.2.3.  A  certificate  of 
analysis has been provided. 
Characterisation (LVV)
Characterisation of the LVV includes the provirus and vector proteins and impurities. All genetic (regulatory) 
elements  are  identified  and  the  full  sequence  of  the  provirus  has  been  provided.  Characterisation  on  PPQ 
batches is sufficient confirmation that vector with the correct sequence is consistently manufactured. 
Vector aggregation was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Although no aggregates were 
observed,  the  applicant  evaluated  the  potential  presence  of  aggregates  using  multiple  methods.  It  was 
confirmed that aggregate formation during storage is low.
The applicant presented sufficient data concerning characterisation of a representative batch of ARSA LVV that 
justify the selection of relevant specifications. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 20/157
 
 
This  characterisation  included  quality  attributes  such  as  potency,  infectivity,  non-infectious  viral  particles. 
Potency of ARSA LVV was determined via transduction of reference cell lines, and ARSA transgene activity was 
evaluated  in  the  same  cell  lines.  The  representativeness  of  the  reference  cell  line  was  also  demonstrated. 
Correlations between the characterised attributes were demonstrated where appropriate. Impurity data were 
also evaluated and demonstrated to be reduced to appropriate levels.
Control of critical steps and intermediates (LVV)
For  all  steps  in  the  LVV  manufacturing  process  several  CPPs  are  identified  and  controlled.  The  in-process 
controls (IPCs) are limited but sufficient to monitor the process and assure process consistency. 
Process validation and/or evaluation (LVV)
The LVV manufacturing process has been appropriately validated. Several process performance qualification 
(PPQ) batches were manufactured. and met the release criteria. Information about the validation of ARSA LVV 
transportation has also been provided.
Manufacturing process development (LVV)
The applicant has provided a clear overview of the changes made to the vector manufacturing process. The 
changes  are  considered  sufficiently  justified.  There  are  no  indications  that  the  changes  in  manufacturing 
procedure have negatively impacted product quality or clinical efficacy. 
Control of active substance (LVV)
The ARSA LVV release specification includes tests for potency, purity, identity, safety, and general tests e.g. 
for pH, osmolality. The proposed LVV specifications are acceptable. 
Reference standard or materials
An in-house reference preparation is used for the LVV. The protocol for preparation and testing of a new in-
house reference standard is considered appropriate. 
Container closure (LVV)
ARSA  LVV  is  filled  into  a  sterile,  single  use  cryovial.    The  information  provided  on  the  container  closure  is 
adequate and sufficient.
Stability (LVV)
Thirty-six-months long-term stability (at ≤-65˚C) data are currently available. Several batches of ARSA LVV 
are put on long-term stability.
The available stability data support the proposed shelf-life for ARSA LV (36 months) and the proposed 
storage conditions (≤-65˚C). 
The provided stability data do not indicate a different stability profile for the vectors from the different 
manufacturing processes. 
Stability studies for several batches of ARSA LVV manufactured according to the commercial process are 
currently ongoing in accordance with the stability protocol. The studies will be continued until completion.

2) Active substance
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturers
The active substance is manufactured and controlled by Molmed S.p.A in Milan, Italy. MIA and GMP certificate 
references have been provided.
Description of manufacturing and process controls (AS)
The  description  of  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  includes  flow  charts,  narratives,  and  tabular 
overviews of the critical process parameters and in process controls. 
 The process consists of CD34+ cell enrichment, pre-stimulation, transduction, and cell harvest. The description 
of the manufacturing process is appropriate after additional information was provided upon request.
Information on the batch scale has been provided in the finished product section as this is a continuous batch 
process. No reprocessing is performed.
Controls of materials (AS)
Raw materials (AS)
An overview of the raw materials used for the active substance manufacturing has been provided, including 
information on the manufacturer and specifications. Information on the compatibility of the materials used in 
production with the cells and the potential extractables and leachables has been also provided.
Starting materials 
Autologous cells (bone marrow or mobilised peripheral blood)
The information provided on the autologous cells is sufficient. Procurement of bone marrow (BM) or mobilised 
peripheral  blood  (mPB)  by  qualified  centres  and  compliance  with  relevant  directives  is  confirmed.  Virus 
screening,  mycoplasma  testing  and  compliance  with  EC  2004/23/EC  is  confirmed  by  verification  of 
documentation prior to the start of manufacturing. Acceptance criteria for appearance and quantity of the cell 
suspension were included upon request.
Control of critical steps and intermediates (AS) 
In  process  controls  for  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  are  in  place.  Microbiological  control  is 
performed on the starting materials. The finished product is tested for mycoplasma, endotoxin, and sterility.
Process validation and/or evaluation (AS)
Libmeldy active substance is manufactured to finished product as part of a batch process without interruption. 
Therefore, process validation studies have been provided and can be located in the finished process section. 
Manufacturing process development (AS)
Several different active substance/finished product manufacturing processes are identified. Differences include 
the starting material (BM or mPB), the CD34+ enrichment procedure, the presence or absence of an additional 
cryopreservation  step for the CD34+  enriched cells, the container closure system,  and the final formulation 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 22/157
 
 
(fresh or cryopreserved). The active substance manufacturing process downstream of the CD34+ enrichment 
was the same for all clinical batches. 
It is noted that apart from these changes there were also the changes in the manufacturing of the LVV vector 
(as discussed above). 
Upon request, the applicant has performed a comparability assessment for clinical batches manufactured at 
different sites. Some minor differences were observed that could be attributed to the enrichment step or the 
starting material (BM vs mPB), none of which is expected to impact efficacy or safety. Overall, the data from 
the clinical batches sufficiently support comparability between manufacturing sites.
Comparability AS manufacturing processes
The main differences in the active substance manufacturing processes are the starting materials and the use 
of different CD34+ enrichment systems. In addition, changes were made to the vector manufacturing process 
(see above). The applicant assessed comparability of the clinical batches manufactured from BM and from mPB 
(see  below)  and  the  fresh  and  frozen  formulation  (see  finished  product  section)  but  did  not  discuss 
comparability for the several different manufacturing processes. Upon request, this was further addressed, and 
the applicant performed a retrospective analysis of batches manufactured using vector batches fractionated by 
the different FP manufacturing processes. The slightly lower cell viability in the cryopreserved finished product 
is expected and gives no reason for concern.
Overall, comparability of the active substance/finished product manufacturing processes has been sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
Comparability batches manufactured from BM and mPB
Historically,  Libmeldy  has  been  manufactured  from  bone-marrow  (BM)  derived  cells.  In  order  to  improve 
treatment access with an option of a less invasive method than BM harvest, mobilised peripheral blood (mPB) 
will be added as potential starting material for the commercial manufacturing. 
To support the use of either BM or mPB as starting material, the applicant has manufactured several batches 
from BM and mPB derived from healthy donors and analysed the products before (representative of the fresh 
formulation)  and  after  cryopreservation  (cryopreserved  formulation).  In  addition,  batch  analysis  data  from 
clinical batches manufactured from BM as a fresh (n=29) or cryopreserved formulation (n=4) were compared 
and  an  in  vivo  non-clinical  study  was  performed  to  compare  engraftment.  The  overall  approach  to  assess 
comparability is in line with previous scientific advice and is endorsed. Data to support the use of healthy donor 
cells  as  a  surrogate  for  patient  cells  are  provided  and  show  no  differences  in  cell  viability, %  CD34+,  VCN, 
clonogenic potential and transduction efficiency. 
A  significant  difference  was  observed  in  the  %CD34+  cells  and  clonogenic  potential  between  healthy  donor 
(HD) BM derived batches and HD mPB derived batches, with higher levels in the latter. It is noted that the 
majority of clinical data is obtained with BM-derived batches, and a higher percentage of CD34+ or clonogenic 
potential  is  not  expected  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  clinical  effect.  Some  differences  in  cellular 
composition are observed when comparing BM and mPB and the total amount of cells was higher for mPB. This 
difference is not expected to impact efficacy or safety as it is an autologous product and the dose is based on 
the % CD34+ cells. 
The comparison of clinical batches manufactured from BM (n=33) or mPB (n=10) in general confirm the results 
obtained with healthy donor cells. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 23/157
 
 
Taken  together  the  applicant  has  sufficiently  justified  the  addition  of  mPB  as  a  potential  source  of  starting 
material. It is noted, that analytical results and adverse trends will be further monitored as part of the ongoing 
process verification programme. In addition, follow-up data will be gathered for the patients treated with mPB 
derived batches. 
Characterisation
Characterisation of the transduced cells includes batch analysis data and extended testing results for all clinical 
batches. The extended testing includes immunophenotype, clonogenic potential, impurities (residual host cell 
DNA (discussed in the finished product section) and RCL), and integration site analysis. 
The  immunophenotype  characterisation  with  respect  to  the  potential  cellular  impurities  and  their  specific 
markers is considered sufficient. The relevant cell types have been included. 
No replication competent lentivirus (RCL) was detected in the finished product batches. The LOD of the RCL 
assay was sufficiently justified.
The  integration  site  analysis  was  performed  for  all  clinical  batches  and  clone  abundance  is  considered 
appropriate. 
The release test for VCN measures the average VCN in all cells. VCN in transduced cells was calculated by the 
applicant. Upon review, additional information was requested to justify the range of VCN in transduced cells. 
In response, the applicant provided additional characterisation data, including an analysis of VCN in individual 
colonies. In addition, the applicant provided further analyses comparing attributes such as distribution of VCN, 
clinical safety profile and integration site profile for finished product batches across the range of VCNs observed 
in released finished product batches. The evaluation of the clinical data, in general, gave no indication that the 
VCN  distribution  or  safety  profile  of  batches  is  different  within  the  range  of  VCNs  observed.  Monitoring  of 
circulating cells (and their VCN) in patients continues to be recommended (see clinical assessment report). 
In addition, it is noted that the high percentage of cells with VCN > 10 (up to 44% in finished product 
batches) could be a reason to be cautious with respect to safety. This is further addressed in the non-clinical 
assessment. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure
Specification
All release testing of Libmeldy is performed at the stage of the finished product; therefore, a specification for 
Libmeldy active substance is not required. 
Analytical procedures
No  analytical  testing  is  performed  on  Libmeldy  active  substance  as  all  release  testing  is  performed  at  the 
finished product stage.
Batch analysis
Batch analysis was routinely performed at the active substance stage for Libmeldy fresh formulation when the 
finished product was stored at ambient temperature; however, when the change was made to cryopreserved 
formulation  and  to  store  the  finished  product  at  <  -130°C  the  batch  release  testing  was  carried  out  at  the 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 24/157
 
 
finished  product  stage  of  the  manufacturing  process.  To  aid  review  of  data  across  the  manufacturing 
development history all of the batch analysis data are presented in the finished product section.
Reference standards or materials
Reference standards will not be produced for Libmeldy active substance. Due to the nature of each batch of 
product  being  produced  from  individual  patients,  it  is  agreed  that  it  is  not  possible  to  produce  a  suitable 
reference standard.
Container closure
The active substance and finished product processes are continuous and therefore no information is provided 
on  the  active  substance  container  closure.  The  tubes  in  which  the  cells  are  contained  are  described  in  the 
manufacturing process description. 
Stability
Since Libmeldy is produced on an individual patient basis and the active substance is not stored for any longer 
than it is necessary to ascertain that the quality is sufficient to progress to finished product manufacture, no 
stability studies are ongoing and none are planned. This is acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
Description of the product
Libmeldy dispersion for infusion (FP) is composed of 10 – 20 mL of cryoformulation medium (5% DMSO, 7% 
HSA, and 0.9% saline solution) containing 2-10 x 106 CD34+ enriched cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral 
vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene per mL. 
The product is presented cryopreserved in EVA bag(s). Each infusion bag contains 10 to 20 mL of Libmeldy. 
The number of EVA bags depends on the total amount of cells and will vary between individual patients. After 
thawing, the product is administered by intravenous infusion without further manipulation. 
Since the total number of cells and concentration of CD34+ cells vary between individual patient batches, the 
quantitative  information  regarding  strength  (total  viable  cell  concentration),  volume  of  dispersion  and  total 
number of CD34+ cells per bag and supplied dose of the medicinal product are provided in the Lot Information 
Sheet. The Lot Information Sheet is included with the cryoshipper used to transport Libmeldy. 
Formulation development
Libmeldy was initially formulated as a fresh finished product (i.e. not frozen). In the fresh formulation, the only 
excipient used was saline. 0.9% w/v Sodium Chloride Infusion is purchased as a medicinal product licensed by 
a European Union member state. In-house testing performed on the 0.9% w/v Sodium Chloride Infusion has 
been provided. Endotoxin and sterility are accepted on the supplier’s certificate of analysis.
Subsequently, Libmeldy has been formulated to produce a cryopreserved finished product. The development 
of a cryopreserved formulation is endorsed. Comparability with the fresh formulation is discussed in the section 
below.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 25/157
 
 
The  choice  of  5%  DMSO  as  cryoprotectant  and  7%  human  serum  albumin  as  stabiliser  gives  no  reason  for 
concern. The selected target cell concentration of 2-10 x 106 CD34+ cells/mL is sufficient to ensure that the 
minimum required dose can be administered to all patients, irrespective of any limitations to the maximum 
volume due to the presence of DMSO.
The applicant uses a single source of human serum albumin. It is acknowledged that the albumin used as an 
excipient in Libmeldy is authorised as a medicinal product in the EU and tested by an OMCL for batch release. 
The  batch  release  certificate  confirms  compliance  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  Sufficient  information  is  available  to 
conclude that the albumin has acceptable quality. 
Manufacturing process development 
The  main  changes  to  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  are  related  to  the  addition  of  a 
cryopreservation step to increase the shelf life. Overall, the provided data support comparability between the 
fresh  and  cryopreserved  finished  product  formulations.  The  container  closure  system  and  associated  filling 
method were also changed during development. The changes have been sufficiently discussed and justified. 
For  the  commercial  process,  the  applicant  intends  to  use  either  cells  from  bone  marrow  (BM)  or  mobilised 
peripheral blood (mPB) as starting material. The majority of clinical batches were manufactured using BM (33 
of 37 batches). Data to support comparability between products manufactured from mPB compared to products 
manufactured from BM have been provided.
To support the change from a fresh formulation to a cryopreserved formulation, the applicant has manufactured 
several  batches  from  BM  and  mPB  derived  from  healthy  donors  and  analysed  the  products  before 
(representative of the fresh formulation) and after cryopreservation (cryopreserved formulation). In addition, 
batch analysis data from several clinical batches manufactured from a fresh or cryopreserved formulation were 
compared and, for BM derived batches, an in vivo non-clinical study was performed to compare engraftment. 
The overall approach to assess comparability is endorsed.  
Container closure system
The  choice  of  container  closure  system  (CE-marked  EVA  bag)  is  considered  adequate.  Information  on 
microbiological integrity and compatibility is provided in the sections below. 
Microbiological attributes
Sufficient information has been provided on the microbiological attributes of the dosage form. Container closure 
integrity after storage of the EVA bags in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen was demonstrated. 
Compatibility
Sufficient  information  has  been  provided  on  compatibility  of  the  container  closure  system  and  extractables/ 
leachables  from  direct  contact  materials  (EVA  bags,  filters,  pipettes,  centrifuge  tube,  syringe).  The  risk  to 
patient safety from extractables and leachables was found to be negligible. 
No  impact  of  the  cryopreservation/thawing  process  in  EVA  bags  was  observed  for  finished  product  batches 
manufactured from healthy donor cells. In use stability data for finished product batches manufactured from 
healthy donor mPB or BM support storage up to 2 hours at ambient temperature post-thaw. 
Statements are included in the SmPC that the product must not be mixed with other medicinal products, and 
should not be washed, spun down, and/or resuspended in new media prior to infusion. A shelf life of maximum 
2 hours at room temperature (20°C-25°C) once thawed is indicated. This is acceptable.
EMA/584450/2020

Manufacture of the product and process controls
Manufacturers
The manufacturers responsible for the manufacturing and release of the finished product are GMP compliant.
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  batch  process  that  is  continuous  from  receipt  of  patient  material  to 
cryopreservation  of  the  finished  product  in  the  final  container  for  use.  The  finished  product  manufacturing 
process consists of cell wash, cell concentration, final formulation, filling and cryopreservation. 
After formulation, quality control (QC) samples are collected prior to filling the FP into ethylene vinyl acetate 
(EVA) cryobags. The primary EVA cryobag is placed in a secondary, labelled, EVA overwrap bag in a Grade B 
room. This secondary overwrap bag is sealed in a non-classified area. Labelled and packaged finished product 
and QC samples are cryopreserved at the same time using a controlled-rate freezer. After cryopreservation, 
each frozen finished product bag is placed into a metal cassette and stored at < -130°C in vapor-phase of liquid 
nitrogen.
Sufficient detail on the procedures, critical process parameters and in process controls have been provided. 
The  actions  taken  in  case  the  action  limit  established  for  the  viability  in-process  control  is  not  met  are 
appropriately described and justified. 
Batch and scale definition
Libmeldy is a patient-specific, autologous product and therefore each batch is manufactured for one patient 
using autologous patient bone marrow (BM) or autologous mobilised peripheral blood (mPB) as a cellular source 
from which to derive the starting material. More than one collection may occur in certain circumstances for 
manufacture of a batch. 
The scale of the active substance manufacturing process is dependent on:
(i) the number of mononuclear cells obtained from BM or in the case of mPB, the quantity of CD34+ cells, and 
(ii) any cell growth during the culture phase. 
Sufficient information on the pooling of different starting material collections was provided. 
Qualified Treatment Centres (QTC)
The applicant will qualify each of the treatment centres, and they will perform the collection of autologous cells 
for commercial manufacture of the finished product. 
The  Product  Manual  contains  detailed  instructions  for  staff  responsible  for  the  collection  and  packaging  of 
autologous cellular source material.
Traceability
Traceability of is carried out in accordance with the qualified treatment centre, manufacturing facility policies, 
and internal SOPs. The patient code and the finished product batch number are both recorded in batch register, 
and in the batch record. The finished product and active substance are managed in the same batch record. The 
system in place assures traceability of the product throughout the entire manufacturing process.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 27/157
 
 
Sufficient information has been provided on traceability, including a flow diagram and brief descriptions of the 
different components. The finished product label will contain the Chain of identity (COI) ID and batch number 
assigned to that specific COI ID.
Controls of critical steps and intermediates
An in-process control in the finished product manufacturing process has been identified by the applicant. This 
is acceptable, as the finished product manufacturing process is very short and only consists of cell wash, 
concentration, formulation, filling and cryopreservation. 
Microbiological control (BactAlert), endotoxin, and mycoplasma are tested at the finished product release, and 
the results will be available prior to administration to the patient. 
Process validation and/or evaluation
As  the  manufacturing  process  of  Libmeldy  is  a  continuous  process  (i.e.  Libmeldy  active  substance  is 
manufactured to finished product without interruption), the process validation provided in section P.3.5 of the 
dossier covers both the AS and FP manufacturing process. 
Media fills
Three  successful  media  fill  runs  were  performed  at  the  manufacturing  site.  The  process  at  maximum 
manufacturing scale was challenged by e.g. the total volume processed, the number of operations, and the 
duration of the manufacturing process including finished product filling. 
Process performance qualification (PPQ)
The applicant has performed a PPQ study using healthy donor cells from BM and mPB at its manufacturing site. 
The use of healthy donor cells for PPQ is agreed from an ethical perspective and is supported by comparability 
data. 
The PPQ data demonstrate that the process is capable to consistently produce finished product batches that 
comply with the specifications. 
Impurity removal
The applicant evaluated removal of process related impurities.   Results of the evaluation demonstrate that the 
wash steps are capable of reducing the levels of process related impurities. The applicant provided evidence 
that the residual infectious virus poses a negligible risk for secondary infection or off-target toxicity.
The applicant provided a statement that no risk of nitrosamine presence in Libmeldy has been identified and 
the supporting risk evaluation. This is acceptable.
Ongoing process verification
A continuous process verification approach will be used to provide assurance that the process remains in a 
state of control during routine commercial manufacturing. 
A brief summary has been provided of the ongoing process verification that will be implemented. The studies 
are  aimed  to  monitor  process  consistency,  based  on  the  results  of  release  testing,  in  process  testing  and 
additional characterisation. Results outside the acceptance criteria, and control limit and trend violations will 
be investigated. Sufficient information has been provided. 
Transport validation
EMA/584450/2020
Page 28/157
 
 
The transport validation gives no reason for concern. Both the shipment of the patient cellular source material 
from the qualified treatment centre (QTC) to the contract manufacturing organisation (CMO) manufacturing 
sites and the transport the final cryopreserved finished product from the CMOs to the QTC for administration 
are adequately addressed.
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis
Specifications
The finished product specifications include tests for identity (transgene function (ARSA activity)), identity, 
potency, purity and safety. Further quality and clinical assessments on whether additional specifications (or 
modifications) for source material and/or finished product are required will be completed when data from an 
additional batch becomes available. The applicant is recommended to routinely evaluate the finished product 
specifications as part of the annual product review. In line with the strategy to set specifications, clinical 
outcome data review will be part of this process. In addition, as part of the continued process verification 
process a full evaluation of manufacturing data and tests will be performed, and this will also feed into 
specifications review. A Major Objection was raised to the applicant’s initially proposed release strategy as 
additional controls would be required to justify the proposal from a quality perspective.  
In response to continued review dialogue, the applicant changed to a conventional release strategy, which was 
acceptable  from  a  quality  point  of  view.  The  MAH  is  requested,  in  the  context  of  an  Annex  II  condition,  to 
reduce  the  overall  time  from  patient  screening  to  treatment  to  within  the  ranges  observed  during  clinical 
development,  while  ensuring  that  product  quality  remains  adequately  controlled  prior  to  administration. 
Reduction of the time needed for product testing and release should be part of these measures.
Analytical procedures
A summary of validated or compendial analytical procedures used for quality control testing of Libmeldy 
finished product has been provided by the applicant.  
In general, clear and sufficiently detailed method descriptions have been provided. Summaries and reports of 
the method validations have been provided. 
Batch analysis
Batch analysis data are provided for several batches manufactured for the clinical studies and for several PPQ 
batches. The batch analysis results also include tests that are performed for information only. 
Justification of specifications
The proposed acceptance criteria are sufficiently justified. 
Reference standard or materials
Reference standards will not be produced for Libmeldy finished product. Due to the nature of each batch of 
product  being  produced  from  individual  patients  it  is  not  possible  to  produce  a  suitable  reference  standard. 
Given the autologous nature of the product, this is acceptable. Each assay has been developed with its own 
qualified internal controls and standards.
Container closure system
Libmeldy finished product is filled into one or more sterile, single use, pre labelled 50mL ethylene vinyl acetate 
(EVA) infusion bag(s) with two available spike ports. Each primary bag is then sealed and packaged into an 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 29/157
 
 
overwrap  EVA  bag  which  is  also  sealed,  the  packaged  finished  product  is  then  cryopreserved.  The  frozen 
packaged configuration is placed in a metal cassette for storage in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. 
Libmeldy is shipped from the manufacturing facility to the treatment centre storage facility in a cryoshipper, 
which may contain multiple metal cassettes intended for a single patient. Each metal cassette contains one 
infusion bag of Libmeldy. 
Sufficient information is provided on the container closure system. This includes an overview of the raw material 
of the different components of the primary container closure system and the manufacturer’s specifications of 
the cryobags. The bags are sterilised. A Certificate of analysis (CoA) and CE-certificate are provided. 
The  choice  of  container  closure  system  (CE-marked  EVA  bag)  is  considered  adequate.  Information  on 
microbiological  integrity  and  compatibility  gives  no  reason  for  concern.  The  same  container  is  used  in  the 
stability study to support the shelf life, however, as a smaller fill volume was used in the stability studies, the 
bags  were  heat  sealed  to  reduce  the  nominal  volume  and  mimic  the  volume  to  surface  area  expected  for 
finished product with the lowest recommended fill volume. This is acceptable. 
Stability of the product
Up  to  6  months  stability  data  have  been  provided  for  finished  product  batches  manufactured  from  healthy 
donor material and in use stability data are available at the beginning and end of shelf-life.
It can be accepted that the stability claims are based on data obtained with healthy donor cells, as comparability 
of healthy donor cells and patient derived cells has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The stability data support the proposed shelf life of 6 months when stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen 
at  <  -130°C  and  in  use  stability  of  the  thawed  product  for  2  hours  at  room  temperature  (20°C-25°C).  All 
acceptance criteria were met and no trends were observed. 
No other stability studies are ongoing and none are planned. Additional stability studies may be performed in 
support of process changes, process validation, and comparability studies.
Post approval change management protocol(s) 
 N/A
Adventitious agents
Non-viral adventitious agents
The  microbial  control  is  sufficiently  described.  Appropriate  in  process  controls  are  in  place  in  the  LVV 
manufacturing  process.  Microbiological  control  is  performed  on  the  mPB  or  BM.  Upon  request  a  method 
description  and  validation  were  provided.  As  the  manufacturing  process  is  short  and  includes  several  wash 
steps, it is agreed that no further in process tests are in place for microbial control. The final product is tested 
for mycoplasma, endotoxin, and sterility. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 30/157
 
 
The  risk  of  contamination  with  animal  TSE  is  appropriately  addressed.  FBS  is  the  only  material  from  TSE 
relevant animal species that is used in the manufacturing process. It is derived from countries with negligible 
BSE risk; relevant certificates have been provided.
Adventitious viruses
An overview of the starting materials, raw materials, and excipients of biological origin used in the LVV, DS, 
and  finished  product  manufacturing  process  has  been  provided.  The  information  provided  in  the  initial 
application and in response to questions is sufficient and gives no reason for any concern. 
The human serum albumin (HSA) used is licensed as a medicinal product in EU. All constituent plasma pools 
have been tested by an OMCL for virological markers.
In summary, the information provided concerning the adventitious agents safety is adequate and the TSE and 
virus safety of Libmeldy has been sufficiently demonstrated.
GMO
For discussion and conclusions on the environmental risks related to this GMO product (autologous CD34+ 
cell enriched population that contains haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a 
lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A gene) see relevant sections in the CHMP/CAT 
Assessment Report (see non-clinical section for further information).
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The provided Module 3 documentation is of reasonable quality. The information on the manufacturing process 
and its control is sufficient. Valid GMP certificates for gene therapy manufacturing and for QC testing 
(microbiological, chemical and biological) have been submitted for the relevant manufacturing sites. 
Process validation is performed in line with expectations and in general demonstrates that the process is 
capable to consistently produce finished product batches that comply with the specifications. The proposed 
specifications are acceptable. Some commitments have been provided in relation to further methods 
validation. These are acceptable.
Several changes were made to the manufacturing process of the virus vector and the AS/FP.  Additional data 
were provided to demonstrate that the clinical and commercial batches are sufficiently comparable. 
The applicant proposes to use either bone marrow (BM) or mobilised peripheral blood (mPB) as starting 
material. From a patient perspective, the addition of mPB as a potential source of starting material is 
sufficiently justified. Upon request, additional data were provided that demonstrate comparability. Although 
some differences are observed in cell composition that can be attributed to the difference in starting material, 
there are no indications that this results in differences in clinical outcome.
Characterisation of the transduced cells includes batch analysis data and extended testing results for all 
clinical batches. Upon request the applicant the applicant provided additional characterisation data, including 
an analysis of VCN in individual colonies. In addition, the applicant also provided further analyses comparing 
attributes such as distribution of VCN, clinical safety profile and integration site profile for drug product 
batches across the range of VCNs observed in released drug product batches. The evaluation of the clinical 
data, in general, gave no indication that the VCN distribution or safety profile of batches varied within the 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 31/157
 
 
range of VCN observed. Monitoring of circulating cells (and their VCN) in patients continues to be 
recommended (see clinical assessment report). The re-evaluation of the finished product specifications as 
part of the annual product review will also take into account the clinical outcome data.
A Major Objection was raised to the applicant’s initially proposed release strategy as additional controls would 
be required to justify the proposal from a quality perspective. In response to continued review dialogue, the 
applicant changed to a conventional release strategy, which was acceptable from a quality point of view. The 
MAH is requested, in the context of an Annex II condition, to reduce the overall time from patient screening 
to treatment to within the ranges observed during clinical development, while ensuring that product quality 
remains adequately controlled prior to administration. Reduction of the time needed for product testing and 
release should be part of these measures.
The provided stability data support the proposed shelf life of 6 months at < -130°C and the claim that once 
thawed, the shelf life is maximum 2 hours at room temperature (20°C -25°C). 
Taken together, the application is acceptable from a quality point of view. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The overall quality of Libmeldy is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions as 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation 
comply with existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, 
controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised and appropriate specifications are set. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The 
quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. Adventitious agents 
safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
The CAT has identified the following measures necessary to address the identified quality developments 
issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product:
The MAH should take measures to reduce the overall time from patient screening to treatment to within the 
ranges observed during clinical development (median 8.2 weeks; range 6-12.4 weeks). Reduction of the time 
needed for product testing and release should be part of these measures. (Report on implementation to be 
submitted 12 months from the Commission Decision, i.e. Dec 2021).  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above. 
The applicant agreed to the Recommendations as identified below.
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CAT 
recommended several points for further investigation. These included additional tests on starting materials, 
sourcing and control of raw materials, improvements in analytical methods and re-assessment of acceptance 
criteria for in-process and release testing attributes for the finished product. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the recommendations for future quality development as 
described above.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
Libmeldy is a cell-based gene therapy medicinal product intended for the treatment of metachromatic 
leukodystrophy (MLD). The active substance of Libmeldy consists of an autologous CD34+-enriched cell 
population (containing CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, HSPCs) ex vivo transduced with a 
replication-defective, self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene 
under the control of a human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. The active substance is formulated in 
a cryopreservative solution containing 5% DMSO and 7% HSA (in 0.9% sodium chloride) and is -after 
thawing- intravenously infused into the patient, who preceding to the treatment underwent busulfan 
myeloablative conditioning. 
For the proof-of-principle studies, the applicant has used murine Lin- HSPCs as homologue for human CD34+ 
cells, although the LV vector did contain human PGK and ARSA. This approach is endorsed.
Primary pharmacodynamics
2.5.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamics
In vitro studies
In 2 in vitro studies, the applicant determined the transduction capacity of 1) wild-type and ARSA-deficient 
murine bone marrow-derived Lin- HPSCs and 2) healthy human CD34+ cord blood-derived HSPCs. These cell 
populations could be efficiently transduced with GFP-LV or ARSA-LV and transduction of As2-/--derived HSPCs 
with ARSA-LV resulted (in vivo) in supraphysiological ARSA activity. Using the LTC-IC test (to determine 
early/primitive progenitors, which are the in vivo long-term engrafters), considerably more myeloid 
progenitors than erythroid progenitors were found when ARSA-LV-transduced (human) HSPCs was used as 
starting material for the LTC-IC test. This is advantageous as the mechanism of action of the product consists 
of a.o. differentiation of myeloid progenitors into microglia as a crucial step to achieve transgene ARSA 
expression in the brain. It is not known whether this preference for the myeloid lineage is also observed after 
engraftment, upon clinical use. 
The applicant also conducted an in vitro study with healthy human CD34+ bone marrow-derived HSPCs to 
determine the optimal clinical transduction protocol (i.e. 24h or 48h pre-stimulation, 1 or 2 transduction 
cycles). Protocol E (i.e. 24h pre-stimulation, 2 transduction cycles) appeared to be superior over the other 2 
protocols on bulk level. Nevertheless, a large variation in e.g. VCN, ARSA activity, cell recovery and number 
of colonies was seen between individual experiments (with all transduction protocols) suggesting that it may 
not able to produce ARSA-LV-transduced human HSCPs with characteristics within a narrow range. The 
selected protocol E was subsequently tested in HSPCs from an MLD patient, but some in vitro experiments 
(e.g. regarding yield/CD34+ expression and clonogenic potential of MLD cells) were not conducted. This limits 
the possibility to conclude about the optimal transduction protocol in cells from patients compared to healthy 
donors. Nevertheless, protocol E is already used to produce clinical batches. Production of cell batches, their 
specifications and comparison of transductability between healthy donor and MLD cells is (briefly) discussed 
in the quality AR.
In vivo studies
EMA/584450/2020
Page 33/157
 
 
Three in vivo studies were conducted to determine 1) the engraftment and transgene expression by murine 
HSPCs, and 2) the treatment efficacy in pre-symptomatic and in symptomatic As2-/- mice.
Engraftment of transduced murine HSPCs was determined in wild type mice. C57BL/6 female mice were IV 
administered a single dose of 1x106 Lin- GFP-LV HSPCs per mouse at 6 weeks of age, after a conditioning 
regimen of total body irradiation (8 Gy). Mice were subsequently followed for 9 months. In addition, an 
unknown quantity of bone marrow cells of these mice was transplanted into secondary recipients, which were 
followed for 3 months post-transplantation. The majority of transplanted HSPCs could engraft in both primary 
and secondary recipient mice, with 53-95% (primary: mean 75%, secondary: mean 69%) of the total blood 
leukocytes expressing the GFP transgene during the follow-up period. These data show that the GFP-LV was 
present in stem cells and long-term progenitors.
The therapeutic potential of ARSA-LV-transduced HSPCs was first tested in a pre-symptomatic As2-/- mouse 
model. Pre-symptomatic female As2-/- mice were IV administered a single dose of 1x106 Lin- ARSA-LV murine 
HSPCs (or GFP-LV-transduced cells or untransduced wild type cells as control) per mouse at 6 weeks of age, 
after a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (8 Gy). Mice were subsequently followed for 11 months. 
This study showed that transduced HSPCs and HSPC-derived cells produced supraphysiological levels of ARSA 
activity in PBMCs. These high levels appeared to be needed for and resulted in normalisation of disease-
affected sulfatide metabolism and protection from disease-related neurological abnormalities (i.e. average 
neurological values similar or even improved compared to values from wild type mice) during the follow-up 
period. 
In a second study to test therapeutic efficacy, symptomatic As2-/- female mice were IV administered a single 
dose of 1x106 Lin- ARSA-LV HSPCs (or control cells) per mouse at 6 months of age, after a conditioning 
regimen of total body irradiation (12 Gy). Mice were subsequently followed for 6 months. This study showed 
that the majority of transduced HSPCs engrafted and that HSPC-derived cells in blood and liver produced 
supraphysiological levels of ARSA activity. Based on mean group data, reconstitution of ARSA activity was 
also observed in the brain, but at lower levels compared to wild type controls. No individual data were 
available, however, variation in VCN and ARSA activity between mice within a group appeared to be 
substantial (based on graphical data in the publication). 
2.5.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamics
To assess the safety of ARSA overexpression concerning sulfate and sulfatase homeostasis, the impact of 
ARSA overexpression on the activity of other sulfatases was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The activity of 
several SUMF1-dependent sulfatases was not impaired by ARSA overexpression. ARSC and ARSE activity was 
even significantly increased when compared to activity in GFP-transduced HSPCs. This was consistent with 
the in vivo sulfatase activities measured in ARSA transgenic mice, where ARSA activity up to 30-fold 
compared to controls did not result in haematopoietic or neurological abnormalities. Besides, ARSA 
overexpression in human HSPCs administered to neonate immunodeficient Rag2-/- -chain-/- mice did not 
impair in vivo clonogenic and differentiation potentials of human HSPCs.
2.5.1.3.  Safety pharmacology
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies have been performed with human or murine HSPCs transduced 
with ARSA-LV. Since no overt (histopathological) toxicity in the CNS, cardiovascular or respiratory systems 
EMA/584450/2020

related to administration of ARSA-LV-transduced HPSCs has been observed in any of the animal studies, the 
absence of additional studies is endorsed.
2.5.1.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
No dedicated PD drug interaction studies have been performed for Libmeldy, as these were not considered 
relevant. The absence of these studies can be endorsed. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics
2.5.2.1.  Methods 
The analytical methods for measuring the concentration of cells of formulations administered to animals, 
engraftment, cell differentiation, vector copies/integrations, and transduction efficiency were generally similar 
throughout the nonclinical studies and were validated before conducting the GLP studies, which can be 
agreed. 
2.5.2.2.  Absorption
It is agreed with the applicant that no dedicated absorption studies were conducted. 
2.5.2.3.  Distribution
The main premise for using LVV transduced HSCP as a curative treatment for MLD is the repopulation of brain 
tissue with HSCP-derived transduced microglial cells that can cross correct the enzymatic defect caused by 
mutated ARSA in the brains. Therefore, studies on the distribution of the genetically modified cells in 
particular to the brain are regarded as key for the proposed mechanism of action of this product. Distribution 
of the product was studied in two homologous mouse models (wildtype C57BL/6 and diseased As2-/- mice, 
Biffi et al. (2004) and Capotondo et al. (2012)) with murine Lin- HSCP transduced with GFP-LV. These 
homologous models were also used to investigate the effect of various conditioning methods on the 
redistribution of the genetically modified cells to the CNS (Capotondo et al., 2012). Also, the distribution of 
ARSA-LV or GFP–LV transduced human (CB) HSPCs was analysed in immunodeficient mouse models (Rag2-/-
Il2r gamma chain-/- or NSG mice, Capotondo, 2007). These heterologous models were also used to 
investigate the effect of the transduction protocol (Report 2017N330774), the difference between fresh and 
cryopreserved batches (Report 2016N302792) and the particulars of a GMP grade batch (Report 
2017N327519; Cesani, 2015). Distribution of the enzyme to the CNS and cross-correction of the disease 
phenotype in untransduced brain cells through the uptake of ARSA produced by ARSA-LV transduced cells 
that repopulated the brain, was studied in an FAH-/- animal model in which FAH+/+ hepatocytes stably and 
selectively expressing ARSA-HA in the liver ARSA-HA LV transduced As2-/- animals. ARSA-HA transgenic 
animals and untransduced As2-/- animals served as controls (Biffi, 2006). 
Distribution of donor murine Lin-HSPCs from CD45.1 C57BL/6 mice transduced with GFP-LV (under control of 
the PGK promoter) upon injection into recipient CD45.2 C57BL/6 mice was assessed 3, 6 and 9 months post 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 35/157
 
 
primary injection/ transplantation and 3 months post-secondary injection / transplantation. Three months 
post primary transplantation, most of the GFP+ cells appeared to co-express the macrophage markers F4/80 
and/or CD11b. In the periphery, GFP signal was observed as expected in liver Kupffer cells, kidney 
macrophages, alveolar macrophages and cells in red and white pulp of the spleen. More importantly, a strong 
expression of GFP was observed in the CNS. In the cerebrum, cerebellum, and the outer cortical layers of the 
brain near the meninges GFP positive cells with ramified morphology characteristic of microglia were 
observed. The frequency of these cells in cerebrum and cerebellum increased up to approximately 30% of the 
resident F4/80+ microglia by 9 months, often located in clusters in various regions of the CNS including the 
neocortex, hippocampus & fimbria, cerebellar cortex & vermis, and spinal cord. In the PNS, GFP+ cells were 
observed between the somata of sensory neurons in the ganglia and within the endoneurium (i.e. connective 
tissues around the myelin sheath) of the sciatic nerve, identified as endoneurial macrophages. GFP+ cells in 
the sensory ganglions and sciatic nerve accounted respectively for 55 to 60% at 6 and for, 77% and 62% of 
the F4/80+ cells in at 9 months post-transplantation. Three months post-secondary transplantation, GFP+ 
cells in CNS and PNS were at a frequency similar and with comparable ramified morphology to that observed 
in the primary recipients, indicating that CNS-migrated cells originated from self-renewing, long-term 
repopulating HSPCs. 
Distribution of donor murine Lin- HSPCs from As2-/- mice, the murine model of MLD, transduced with GFP-LV 
(under control of the PGK promoter) upon injection into recipient irradiated As2-/- mice was assessed. Three 
months post transplantation,  GFP expression was observed in 82% (69-95%) of all blood cell lineages 
evaluated and six months post transplantation, extensive migration of GFP+/F4/80+ cells towards CNS and 
PNS was observed with particular abundance seen in the white matter-rich areas that are mostly affected by 
lipid storage, e.g., the corpus callosum and hippocampal fimbria. The majority of GFP+/F4/80+ cells showed 
a diseased swollen, amoeboid morphology of microglia, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reactivity due to 
sulfatide storage in the cytoplasm. The abundance of GFP+ cells in the PNS of As2-/- MLD mice was greater 
compared to C57BL/6 mice, suggesting enhanced recruitment from the BM and/or more rapid turnover of the 
resident macrophage/microglia population in the nervous system of MLD mice, along with preferential 
targeting of lipid storage sites by transgene-expressing activated microglia.
Biodistribution of Human CB-derived HSPCs, transduced with laboratory-grade ARSA LV and GFP LV and 
injected into neonate immunodeficient Rag2-/- -chain-/- mice showed efficient engraftment of transduced cells 
into bone marrow, spleen and thymus that persist up to 20 weeks and differentiate into multi-lineages in 
haematopoietic organs. The human cells retrieved from the spleen of the transduced mouse show ARSA or 
GFP expression in the long-term. As both ARSA and GFP LV-transduced cells engraft, persist and differentiate 
similarly, it was concluded that ARSA (over)expression does not impair in vivo clonogenic and differentiation 
potentials of LV-transduced cord blood-derived human HSPCs when compared to GFP expressing cells. 
The effects of three myeloablative conditioning regimens (busulfan (BU), irradiation (IRR) and treosulfan 
(TREO)) on the reconstitution of various brain cells (macrophage/microglia cells (CD45+CD11b+), 
parenchymal microglia cells μ-cells, TAμ cells and CNS-Φ cells (meningeal, perivascular, and choroid plexus 
macrophages) was assessed 5, 14, 45, 90 and 180 days post transplantation in wildtype and As2-/- mice. At 
Day 5 post-transplantation, GFP+ cells were detected at similar locations and with similar frequency between 
myeloablative conditions. At Day 14 – 90 post transplantation, (sustained donor chimerism was established in 
BM) GFP+ microglia cells increased over time for all conditioning regiments but with decreasing efficiency 
upon BU, IRR and TREO conditioning. The frequency of CNS-Φ cells progressively matched with cells in BM 
and peripheral blood, suggesting that this population turns over with circulating cells. The frequency of GFP+ 
TAμ cells was for each time point lower that the CNS-Φ but higher than the μ population and with most GFP+ 
TAμ cells for BU animals. The frequency of GFP+ μ cells was lower than CNS-Φ cells and increased with time 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 36/157
 
 
in the BU and IRR animals, which was not observed in TREO animals up to 90 days post translation. These 
cells showed the morphology of microglia cells at different maturation states and often appearing as ramified 
parenchymal cells in clusters, which appeared later and to a lesser extent mature in IRR animals, whereas 
these cells were lacking in TREO animals.
The myeloablative condition BU and IRR, but not TREO caused a reduction in the frequency of endogenous 
myeloid cells that was associated with a progressive decline in μ cell relative frequency and with an increase 
in TAμ cell frequency (FACS). The endogenous microglia in BU treated mice showed de-ramified (senescent) 
morphology and Annexin V+ staining of the endogenous GFP- cells (apoptosis) within the 
macrophage/microglia population, which was observed in BU treated and, to a lower frequency, in IRR 
treated mice. Apoptosis was furthermore confirmed by microarray showing soon after transplant TNF-α mRNA 
in brains of BU treated and, with a delayed kinetics, in IRR treated animals. These observations indicate that 
busulfan followed by irradiation is the best method to induce depletion (apoptosis) of endogenous microglia 
and promoting repopulation of transplanted (and transduced) macrophage/microglia repopulation. 
Apparently, MLD (As2-/-) microglia showed more sensitivity to the conditioning effect when compared to the 
wild type (As2+/+) mice.  
Biodistribution using pre-GMP ARSA LV preparations generated via three different transduction protocols (A, E 
and F) were tested in vitro and  transduced cells from the  ‘the 2-hit’ (E) and  ‘the 1-hit’ (F) protocol were 
tested in vivo showing  engraftment and differentiation in multiple lineages upon transplantation into sub-
lethally irradiated Rag2-/-Il2r gamma chain-/- (immunodeficient) mice. There were no statistical differences 
in in vivo repopulation and differentiation capacity between un-transduced / un-manipulated cells and the 
cells transduced via protocol E and F. However, the number of mice surviving and the number of mice 
showing engraftment varied for the different conditions (protocol E – Bone Marrow (BM) and Mobilised 
Peripheral Blood, (MPB) samples and Protocol F, BM and MPB) and were very minimal for protocol F-BM. For 
protocol E-BM, the samples showed a large variation in engraftment, questioning the relevance of statistical 
analysis and the outcome thereof (see section 3.2.5).
A study (2017N327519) was undertaken to monitor the biodistribution of cord blood derived HSPCs 
transduced or not transduced with GMP grade lentiviral vector encoding for Human Arylsulfatase A cDNA 
(ARSA.LV) into neonate Rag2-/-Il2r gamma chain-/- mice after sub-lethal irradiation (IRR). Both 
untransduced and ARSA-LV transduced CB HPSCs distributed efficiently to and engrafted in bone marrow, 
spleen, liver, thymus, brain and testis. Cells also differentiated into multiple haematopoietic lineages and this 
seems similar for the different conditions in the bone marrow, spleen and liver. 
The potential for in vivo vector mobilisation from human to mouse cells was further investigated using the B2 
SINE PCR assay. No signal was detected in DNA samples from the bone marrow (n=7), spleen (n=10) and 
testis (n=8) of mice transplanted with ARSA LV-transduced human CB-derived CD34+ cells, confirming that 
ARSA LV distributed stably associated with the human genome and is not transferred into genomes of the 
transplanted mice cells. 
An in vivo study was undertaken to compare the engraftment of fresh and cryopreserved ARSA transduced 
bone marrow CD34+ cells into NSG mice after sub-lethal irradiation conditioning. The engraftment and 
lineage differentiation of human donor cells in recipient mice and integrated vector copies in bone marrow 
from NSG mice transplanted with the two formulations were confirmed by FACS and by qPCR for the brain. 
Overall, these results showed that the engraftment and cell differentiation and VCN in the bone marrow, 
engraftment in the brain and overall, the frequency of long-term repopulating stem cells was comparable in 
mice treated with the fresh or cryopreserved formulation. 
EMA/584450/2020

The reconstitution of ARSA activity in the brain was investigated as part of the study performed in 
symptomatic MLD mice. In this study, the reconstitution of ARSA activity in the brain by HSPC-derived 
microglia was also investigated using an FAH -/- animal model in which FAH+/+ hepatocytes stably 
expressing ARSA-HA were transplanted in liver to provide stable and functional ARSA-HA expression 
selectively in the liver. Using western blot and immunofluorescence, it was shown that the enzyme 
distributed to kidney, but also to dorsal root ganglion was at similar levels found in MLD mice transplanted 
with ARSA-HA LV. However, where ARSA activity was measured in brains of ARSA-HA LV Lin- HSPCs 
transduced MLD mice, ARSA-HA activity could not be detected in mice in which ARSA-HA was stably and 
selectively expressed in the liver. This shows that ARSA is not likely to be transduced over the BBB, but that 
restoring ARSA activity in the brain is likely to be dependent on the reconstitution of µ-cells from ARSA-LV 
transduced and engrafted HSPCs. 
Cross-correction of neurons and glial cells was studied in As2-/- mice (MLD model, symptomatic animals) 
that were transplanted with ARSA-HA LV Lin-HSPCs. ARSA-HA was detected within lysosomes of HSPC-
derived (donor) microglia cells, within endogenous neurons in various areas of the CNS and particularly in 
Purkinje cells by means confocal microscopy analysis. These data indicate the cross-correction of the 
phenotype of diseased cells in the CNS and PNS lacking a functional copy of ARSA (-HA) through ARSA-HA 
produced by transduced microglia cells.
2.5.2.4.  Metabolism 
It is agreed with the applicant that dedicated studies to address the metabolism of the product are not 
required due to the biological nature of the product. 
2.5.2.5.  Excretion
It is agreed with the applicant that a dedicated study to address the risk of release of new virus is not 
required for the Libmeldy as the potential to replicate is very limited due to the design of the product.
2.5.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies
It is agreed with the applicant that dedicated pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are not required for 
Libmeldy. 
2.5.2.7.  Other Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies
It is agreed with the applicant that dedicated pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are not required for 
Libmeldy. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology
No single dose and repeat dose toxicity studies were performed. Single dose toxicity was taken along in the 
long-term toxicity studies. This approach is endorsed. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 38/157
 
 
2.5.3.1.  Long-term toxicity
Pre-conditioning regimen
To evaluate the most appropriate pre-conditioning regimen before transplantation in the toxicity studies, 
(pre-symptomatic) As2-/- mice were IV administered a single dose of 5-7x105 Lin- mock-transduced HSPCs 
per mouse at 6-8 weeks of age, after a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation ([TBI], 2x 4.5 Gy) or 
busulfan (4 days 22 mg/kg/day). Mice were observed for 12 weeks after transplantation. 
Mortality was present in 1 female mouse in the TBI-treated group, while 9 animals (4M + 5F) died 
prematurely in the busulfan-treated group. In their report, the applicant mentioned that no deaths before day 
28 were present in both pre-conditioning groups, demonstrating the absence of acute toxicity due to the 
regimens and/or transplantation. In the GLP long-term toxicity study, however, mortality in some animals 
only occurred in the first 28 days post-transplantation, while the same TBI protocol (i.e. 2x 4.5 Gy) was 
used. Nevertheless, this mortality (7 of the 109 animals) was considerably less than with busulfan in the pre-
regimen testing study. In the PK study on myeloablation for microglia reconstitution, the busulfan dose was 
comparable to the current study. However, no details about busulfan-related mortality were provided. 
Engraftment in peripheral blood (5 weeks post-transplantation) and bone marrow (termination, i.e. 
premature death or week 12) was comparable between both pre-conditioning regimens. Because TBI was 
better tolerated, the applicant used this regimen for pre-conditioning in the long-term toxicity studies. 
Clinically, busulfan instead of irradiation is used as a pre-conditioning regimen. Busulfan is less toxic in 
humans and (based on animal data) is expected to result in a more pronounced depletion and replacement of 
microglia compared to irradiation (see Pharmacokinetic section). 
Toxic and tumorigenic potential
To evaluate the toxic and tumorigenic potential of ARSA-LV-transduced HSPCs, two non-GLP studies were 
conducted, in which wild type or As2-/- mice were IV administered a single dose of 1x106 Lin- ARSA-LV HSPCs 
(or control cells) per mouse at 1-2 months or 7-9 days of age (young adults and neonates, respectively), 
after a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (11 Gy adults, 7.5-8.5 Gy neonates). Mice were followed 
for 8-12 months after transplantation. In both studies, mortality was primarily observed within the first 29 
days after transplantation, which was considered related to the pre-conditioning regimen of total body 
irradiation.
In the first study (Report 2018N364205) in adult As2-/- mice, hepatocellular lipid vacuolation, necrosis and 
neoplasms were found, with the highest frequency and severity in the ARSA-LV HSPC-treated group (i.e. 5 of 
25 mice with neoplasms). To further investigate this, the second study (Report 2018N364207) was conducted 
in wild type and As2-/- mice of two age groups. Hepatocellular changes (such as steatosis and inflammation) 
were observed in all groups, although neoplasms were only found in As2-/- neonates (i.e. in the different test 
groups). Although there did not appear to be a relation between ARSA-LV HSPC treatment and 
tumorigenicity, the applicant conducted a similar study under GLP conditions. As2-/- mice were IV 
administered a single dose of 1x106 Lin- ARSA-LV HSPCs (using the clinical ARSA-LV) or Lin- mock-LV HSPCs 
per mouse at 6-8 weeks of age, after a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (2x 4.5 Gy). During the 
observation period of 12 months after transplantation, only 2 hepatocellular neoplasms were found (1 in 
ARSA-LV group, 1 in mock-LV group). This lower number of neoplasms (compared to the non-GLP studies) 
could be due to differences in the pre-conditioning regimen and/or genetic background. Considerable clinical 
and pathological effects present in all irradiated and HPSC-transplanted groups (mortality, decreased body 
weight gain and food consumption, decreased mean body weight at termination with an increase in relative 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 39/157
 
 
organ weights, impact on erythrocyte-related values, irradiation-related injury to a.o. kidneys, thymus, eyes, 
gonads, Harderian gland, and adrenal glands) were considered related to the pre-conditioning and 
transplantation regimen.
2.5.3.2.  Genotoxicity
The genotoxic potential of Libmeldy was evaluated via analysis of vector integration sites, in vitro 
immortalization, and in vivo oncogenicity. 
To assess common integration sites (CIS) of the Libmeldy-related LV, healthy human CD34+ ARSA-LV HSPCs 
derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood or cord blood were IV administered to 3-day old Rag2-/- IL2rg-/- 
mice, after a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (4.5 Gy). Mice were subsequently followed for 10-
12 weeks. In vitro as well as in vivo, CIS were found for this LV, although no enrichment for a specific gene 
class was observed. These CIS were present in specific genomic regions (i.e. megabase-wide) and did not 
target a single gene (i.e. kilobase-wide) as is the case for oncogenic CIS. 
Determination of the LV integration profile was also conducted in As2-/- mice transplanted with Lin- ARSA-LV 
HSPCs (as part of the GLP long-term toxicity study). In these mice, polyclonal reconstitution was found, 
although clonal diversity was lower than observed in vitro (as expected, because not all clones will engraft). 
The LV integrated within transcription units (thereby targeting genes such Sfi1) without preference for 
promoter or regulatory elements. No preferential expansion of integration near proto-oncogenes or tumour-
suppressor genes was observed. 
To assess the insertional transformation of the Libmeldy-related LV, wild type murine bone marrow-derived 
Lin- HSPCs were transduced with GFP-LV and cultured in an in vitro immortalisation assay. Results indicated 
that the LV does not pose a considerable risk for insertional mutagenesis with transformation and sustained 
growth of HSPCs in vitro.  
Finally, the oncogenicity of the Libmeldy-related LV was assessed with GFP-LV Lin- HSPCs from Cdkn2a-/- 
mice (i.e. FVB mice susceptible to cancer-triggering genetic lesions), which were IV administered to wild type 
FVB mice (6 weeks of age, after total body irradiation with 2x 5.75 Gy, 7.5x105 cells/mouse). In this model, 
the LV appeared to have a preference to integrate within transcription units, but not specifically close to 
promoters (in contrast to retroviruses). GFP-LV transduced cells developed into tumours, but there was no 
tumour acceleration compared to animals treated with untransduced cells. No overrepresentation of any gene 
ontology category in pre-transplanted cells neither a selection for a specific gene class in the tumour cells 
was observed. Thus, despite high numbers of integrations and integration of the PGK promoter in 
transcription units, Libmeldy-related LV showed no considerable insertional transformation potential in the 
tumour-prone mice, which is most likely due to the absence of active LTRs (i.e. LV is self-inactivating). 
2.5.3.3.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity
No dedicated reproductive and developmental studies are undertaken. As the cells are transduced ex vivo 
with a replication-incompetent lentiviral vector, the risk for transduction of the gametes and consequently the 
risk from germline transduction can be regarded as very limited and rather theoretical. The applicant 
addressed the risk of secondary transduction, which appears very limited upon the use of clinical-grade viral 
vector and the presence of human serum. Bystander cell transduction, or the potential for vector 
mobilisation, was not observed to occur in vivo in animals, suggesting that the risk of transduction of 
gametes via vector mobilisation and secondary transduction is also very low or absent. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 40/157
 
 
2.5.3.4.  Other toxicity studies
Detection of replication-competent LV (RCL) is assessed in the quality AR. The presence of residual RCL did 
not raise specific non-clinical safety concerns.  
To assess the potential carry-over of infectious vector particles to off-target cells, Libmeldy-related LV 
shedding was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Healthy human CD34+ HSPCs isolated from cord blood were 
transduced with laboratory-grade and clinical-grade LV, using the clinical transduction protocol. Transduced 
HSPCs cultured with a cell line or primary MSCs showed that vector carry-over from HPSCs to secondary 
targets was possible, but that the use of a clinical-grade vector and the addition of human serum, proteinases 
or heparin could considerably reduce or almost completely inhibit this secondary transduction. Bystander cell 
transduction was also absent in vivo (Rag2-/- -chain-/- mice transduced with human HPSCs), as no human 
genome was found in murine cells. Moreover, Cesani et al. (2015) mentioned that 3 MLD patients with high-
level engraftment of transduced cells did not have LV DNA in their bone marrow-derived MSCs above the 
detection threshold (1-1.5 year after transplantation). These findings suggest that the risk of LV vector 
shedding is considered low. 
No dedicated non-clinical studies to evaluate local tolerance, antigenicity and immunotoxicity, dependence, 
metabolites and impurities were conducted. The absence of these studies was sufficiently justified and can be 
endorsed. No additional studies are warranted.
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
General
It is the responsibility of the applicant that the molecular characterization of the plasmids used for the 
production of the ARSA LVV, and/or the ARSA LVV used for transduction of the CD34+ HSPCs are complete 
and correct. This is the starting point for the environmental risk assessment.
Concerning the CD34+ HSPCs, the Good Practice on the assessment of GMO-related aspects in the context of 
clinical trials with human cells genetically modified using retro/lentiviral vectors (version 3) is applicable. 
This implies that where the applicant demonstrates that:
(i)
there is no or negligible risk of formation of replication-competent virus 
and
(ii)
the finished product is free of residual infectious viral vector particles that are capable of being 
released 
the overall risks for human health (individuals other than the patient) are then considered negligible.
The applicant has sufficiently demonstrated there is no or negligible risk for the formation of RCL.
Concerning the residual LVV ARSA particles, based on theoretical calculations the applicant states that 
negligible amount of the residual infectious LVV is present in the drug product. However, there are 
shortcomings in the information provided by the applicant (the maximum level of viral vector input was not 
sufficiently substantiated, and the formula was not used correctly) and in the experimental data submitted on 
the residual LVV in the product. It is thus anticipated that here will be a considerable amount of residual viral 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 41/157
 
 
particles present in the drug product, contrary to the assumptions of the applicant. However, based on what 
is known from LVV (e.g. with regards to species specificity and stability/inactivation etc), the risk of residual 
infectious LVV in a drug product can, in general, be considered limited. It is also noted that in the treated 
patients, no risk due to residual LVV has been identified while these patients were significantly immune-
compromised at the time of administration. Given these considerations, risks for human health (individuals 
other than the patient) of the residual LVV in this product are not expected. 
Therefore it can be agreed that the risk to the environment of the residual infectious particles in the product 
can be considered negligible.
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Relevance of the As2-/- mouse model
The applicant has used the As2-/- mouse as a disease model for MLD in children. The applicant stated that 
neuropathological changes and symptoms observed in these mice are comparable to those patients, although 
symptoms are milder and disease is not life-threatening (i.e. normal life span). Indeed, while the overall 
pattern of sulfatide storage was comparable between mice and men, Ramakrishnan et al. (2007) showed that 
the amount of sulfatide accumulation in As2-/- mice is not sufficient to mimic toxic levels related to neuronal 
damage in humans, and that overexpression of a sulfatide-synthesising enzyme is needed to produce 
widespread demyelination which is observed in the clinic. As a consequence, the ARSA-deficient mouse model 
does not resemble the devastating neurological deficits found in (advanced) human disease (Hess et al. 
(1996). Because of the milder phenotype of the As2-/- mice model, the effect of the ARSA-LV HPSC treatment 
on neuronal damage could be overestimated when this is directly extrapolated to MLD patients. In addition, 
the variability in MLD disease, in age of onset (late infantile, early juvenile, late juvenile), and the underlying 
ARSA gene mutation are not mimicked in the animal model (i.e. complete absence of ARSA activity, see Hess 
et al., 1996). The mouse model appears to only reflect an early stage of late infantile MLD. 
Although there are some limitations of the As2-/- mouse model, the applicant believed that the in vivo PD 
studies have provided valuable data on the potential of ARSA LV-transduced HSPCs to engraft and 
reconstitute ARSA activity in these mice. This value is recognised and it is considered that the in vivo PD data 
provide a rationale for clinical treatment. However, further extrapolation of non-clinical data to the clinic is 
not possible because of the limitations of the mouse model relevance for different MLD patients and 
differences in a.o. cell dose, LV/cell batches, pre-conditioning regimen and manufacturing process.  
Notably, when compared to in vivo VCN values found in the PBMCs of treated MLD patients, VCN values in 
treated symptomatic animals were considerably higher, which (again) may lead to an overestimation of the 
treatment effect in terms of prevention of onset or reversibility of disease. 
In conclusion, while the used animal model may be able to provide proof of principle, more quantitative 
extrapolation of treatment effects (e.g. effective dose, thresholds for VCN levels or ARSA activity needed for 
disease correction, duration and course of ARSA expression) is not possible based on this animal model and 
discriminative effect for the various MLD variants at different stages of disease (i.e. early and late events) is 
very limited. This is further discussed below.
In vivo PD studies
EMA/584450/2020
Page 42/157
 
 
From PD experiments, a relationship between VCN and ARSA activity as well as clinical scoring data is 
unclear. The applicant was asked to elaborate on a potential relationship using raw data. These raw data 
appeared not to be available and only part of the relative values for the treated animals (compared to wild 
type values) could be presented, which also did not point towards a clear correlation between ARSA activity, 
VCN, clinical scoring and histopathology. It has to be noted that submitted non-clinical PD data are mainly 
composed of the original testing facility (SR-TIGET) studies and bibliographic literature substituting and/or 
supporting certain test(s) or studies. Nevertheless, the applicant was of the opinion that a relationship 
between VCN and ARSA expression existed, but was less visible in mice due to decreased transcriptional 
activity from the human PGK promotor in mice as compared to human. This is not a very plausible 
explanation, as a lower transgene expression and ARSA activity could still correlate with VCN. From the data 
it only appeared that higher VCN and ARSA activity results in better clinical performance of the animals.
The observed difference in VCN and ARSA activity between group A (i.e. lower mean VCN and ARSA activity) 
and B (i.e. higher mean VCN and ARSA activity) in in vivo mice experiments could have been caused by 
batch variation and related differences in a) infectivity of the batch, b) transduction efficiency of the cells, c) 
irradiation dose, causing variability in level of myeloablation, or in d) condition of the transduced cells. All of 
these conditions might have contributed to the observed differences, but absence of raw data leaves a 
definitive explanation / conclusion open. 
In vivo ARSA activity in PBMCs of animals treated pre-symptomatically was considerably higher (mean about 
7-fold) compared to symptomatic animals (mean group A = 2.8-fold, mean group B = 4.2-fold), using a 
comparable transduction protocol.  The applicant noted that this interstudy ARSA activity variability might be 
explained by a better (or more consistent) reconstitution of ARSA activity in pre-symptomatic animals , which 
could be related to differences in the protocols of the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic studies, such as 
age/size of the animals at transplantation and sampling, the conditioning regimen, the transduction protocol, 
and/or size of control group(s). It is very likely that (some of) these factors have added to the differences in 
mean ARSA activity between pre-symptomatic and symptomatic animals. 
According to the applicant, a minimal ARSA activity level of 4-fold the wild type level in PBMCs is required for 
efficacy (i.e. prevention of further disease progression) in disease-affected mice. It was, however, not clear 
how the applicant had determined this threshold value. In addition, the minimal VCN and ARSA activity 
needed in the other HSPC-derived cell types (e.g. Kupffer cells, CNS cells) for in vivo improvement, and 
whether or not this minimal value could be derived from the PBMC threshold value, was not described. 
Whether or not a minimal ARSA activity in clinical studies is also needed was not known. The applicant was 
therefore asked to elaborate on the relation between ARSA activity and in vivo performance of diseased 
animals versus patients, by explaining 1) the rationale for the proposed non-clinical threshold of ARSA 
activity for in vivo efficacy (in MLD mice ≥ 4 fold in PBMCs compared to wild type levels), 2) how this 
threshold relates to minimal ARSA activity in other cell types, 3) whether there is a minimal and optimal 
ARSA activity level needed in patients and a relation thereof to the proposed non-clinical threshold.  The 
threshold proposed by the applicant appeared to be based on the mean ARSA activity value in group B (> 4-
fold), where better in vivo treatment effects were found compared to group A (mean ARSA activity < 4-fold). 
Together with the data from pre-symptomatic mice (ARSA activity ≥ 4-fold), this would support the choice of 
the threshold value. Although the mean ARSA activity value in group B was higher than in group A, there 
were several animals in group A with ARSA activity > 4-fold and animals in group B with ARSA activity < 4-
fold: 
(i)
(ii)
Group A ≥ 4-fold = 4 of the 18 animals for which individual data were available
Group B with < 4-fold = 9 of the 23 animals for which individual data were available
EMA/584450/2020
Page 43/157
 
 
However, individual data did not discriminate between a group ≥ 4-fold and < 4-fold ARSA activity with 
regard to neurophysiological and pathological performance. Thus, a threshold of ≥ 4-fold ARSA activity in 
PBMCs seems not be justified based on the individual animal PD data. Moreover, an estimation for a 
comparable threshold in brain or liver is not valuable either. The applicant admitted that a proposed non-
clinical threshold could not be directly related to a minimal/optimal ARSA activity in patients. Instead, patient 
genotypic differences and disease status at time-of-treatment are more likely to impact the clinical outcome 
than PBMC-related ARSA activity, which is endorsed. 
Whether there is also a minimal ARSA activity level needed in pre-symptomatic animals was not described. 
Taking the individual variation in neurological functioning and pathology into account, the applicant was 
asked to 1) provide individual animal data on in vivo VCN, ARSA activity and neurological scoring (functions 
and pathology), 2) elaborate on a (potential) ARSA activity threshold for in vivo efficacy in pre-symptomatic 
As2-/- mice, and 3) discuss the relation of this threshold to minimal and optimal ARSA activity levels in pre-
symptomatic MLD patients. 
No individual animal data was available. Based on the data from Biffi et al. (2004), the individual ARSA 
activity in PBMCs of treated pre-symptomatic animals was 4- to 8-fold at 7 months post-transplant.  
Therefore, the applicant concludes that the ARSA activity threshold in the PBMCs of these animals was ≥ 4-
fold the wild type levels. However, such a threshold could only be supported by data from treated animals 
with ARSA activity < 4-fold that would result in a considerably lower neurological scoring compared to 
animals with ARSA activity ≥ 4-fold. As these data were not available and considering the individual 
variability in neurophysiological performance in the different groups, a threshold for pre-symptomatic animals 
could not be proposed. Considering the difference in MLD classification of patients compared to animals and 
the absence of a data-supported ARSA activity threshold in pre-symptomatic animals, it was also not possible 
to elaborate on a potential quantitative relationship between ARSA activity levels in animals and patients, as 
acknowledged by the applicant. 
Overall, the available non-clinical pharmacodynamics data show that ARSA LV can transduce murine Lin- and 
human CD34+ HSPCs, resulting in integration of ARSA LV into the DNA and expression of the ARSA protein 
from it. After pre-conditioning of the mice using irradiation or via busulfan treatment, these cells are able to 
engraft and persist in As2-/- mice (lacking the ARSA gene in their bone marrow-derived cells) and in wild type 
mice, and express the ARSA protein locally (including the CNS) and systemically. The resulting functional 
ARSA protein is able to alleviate disease symptoms as exhibited in symptomatic As2-/- mice and protection 
from development of disease symptoms in pre-symptomatic As2-/- mice. Together, these data provide a 
rationale for the treatment of MLD patients with ARSA LV-transduced autologous CD34+ HSPCs after pre-
conditioning of the patients with busulfan. 
Pharmacokinetics / biodistribution
The pharmacokinetic studies with either mouse equivalent cells in wild type or diseased mice or with human 
cells in immune-compromised animals show that genetically modified (CD34+) HSPCs distribute and 
repopulate also to the brain. Data suggest that this occurs most efficiently upon busulfan conditioning, 
followed by total body irradiation. Treosulfan preconditioning seems to result in less effective repopulation of 
the microglia cells in the brains as treosulfan is unable to cross the BBB. As a consequence, treosulfan does 
not remove the endogenous microglia cells and thereby does not provide an empty niche for the transplanted 
HSPCs to repopulate the brains with microglia cells. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 44/157
 
 
In vivo biodistribution studies in mice indicated that busulfan is the most favourable method to induce 
depletion of endogenous microglia and promote macrophage/microglia replacement with transduced cells. 
Apparently, MLD (As2-/-) microglia showed more sensitivity to the conditioning effect when compared to the 
cells from wild type (As2+/+) mice. In toxicology studies using busulfan, it appears that animals have died 
from this myeloablative condition. This was not discussed in the publication of Capotondo (2012) in PNAS. 
The applicant was asked to submit information on the effect of busulfan on animal survival and the 
consequence on the interpretation and reliability of the Capotondo study (2012) in PNAS concerning the 
preference for conditioning regimen.  
The applicant explained that a dose of 60-100 mg/kg was usually well tolerated by the animals. While not 
providing full myeloablation, this dose produced high degrees of stable chimerism, sufficient to provide 
engraftment of 80% of GFP positive cells. Generally, there was nothing noted about mortality in the raw data 
in the pilot study (Report 2015N232105) conducted for selection and optimizing the pre-conditioning 
regimen, also not in the Capotondo study, indicating that the observed mortality was not regarded as an 
remarkable issue. Based on the applicants response it seems likely that the used busulfan regimen was not 
detrimental to the animals. Furthermore, the applicant provided more support for the use of busulfan as 
preconditioning regimen to obtain more efficient brain engraftment of the transduced cells, which may 
(partially) be due to the difference in the inflammatory response in the brains, which is less severe in the 
case of busulfan treatment as compared to irradiation. 
Distribution of the ARSA enzyme to the brain was also studied in an FAH-/- animal model in which FAH+/+ 
hepatocytes stably expressing ARSA-HA were transplanted in the liver to provide stable and functional ARSA-
HA expression selectively in the liver. ARSA-HA transgenic animals and ARSA-HA LV transduced As2-/- 
animals served as controls. This study indicated that ARSA enzyme is not likely to be transduced over the 
BBB, but that restoring ARSA activity in the brain is rather dependent on reconstitution of µ-cells from ARSA-
LV transduced-and-engrafted HSPCs. In the same study, cross-correction of the disease phenotype in 
neurons and glial cells of As2-/- mice transplanted with ARSA-HA LV Lin-HSPCs was observed. ARSA-HA was 
detected within lysosomes of HSPC-derived microglia cells, but also within neurons in various areas of the 
CNS and particularly in Purkinje cells, indicating that cross-correction of the phenotype of diseased cells in 
the CNS and PNS could be restored by secreted ARSA-HA produced by transduced microglia cells.
Biodistribution using pre-GMP ARSA LV preparations generated via three different transduction protocols (A, E 
and F) was tested in vitro (Report 2017N330774), and protocol E showed the highest efficiency. Transduced 
cells from two protocols (i.e. E ‘the 2-hit’ and F ‘the 1-hit’) were used to investigate stable engraftment and 
differentiation in multiple lineages upon transplantation into sub-lethally irradiated Rag2-/- Il2r gamma chain-
/- (immunodeficient) mice. There were no statistical differences in in vivo repopulation and differentiation 
capacity between un-transduced / unmanipulated cells and the cells transduced via protocol E and F. 
However the limited number of samples made the relevance of the statistical analysis questionable together 
with a lack of explanation on the seemingly preferential thymic engraftment compared to bone marrow and 
spleen, and unclear differences in LV integration in the in vivo part of this study may not yield firm 
conclusions on the most effective transduction protocol. Support for pursuing protocol E to the clinic comes 
solely from in vitro data (see section 3.2.1). 
Biodistribution of human CB derived HSPCs transduced or not transduced with GMP grade ARSA.LV into 
neonate Rag2-/- Il2r gamma chain-/- mice after sub-lethal irradiation (IRR) (study 2017N327519) resulted in 
efficient engraftment in bone marrow, spleen, liver, thymus, brain, and testis. Distribution to the brains was 
only presented for 3 animals. Furthermore, data seemed to indicate that cellular differentiation was similar 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 45/157
 
 
for the various tested conditions (unmanipulated (UM), mock transduced (UT) and ARSA LV transduced) in 
the bone marrow, spleen, and liver. However, transduction, either with ARSA LV or UT seemed to influence 
the engraftment, preferring thymus for bone marrow, and it appeared that UT and ARSA LV transduced cells 
differed in their thymic CD4/CD8 ratio (i.e. UT more thymic CD8+ T cells and ARSA LV having more thymic 
CD4+ T cells).  An explanation on the preference of engraftment to the thymus over the bone marrow and the 
difference in thymic CD4/CD8 ratios for the different conditions was requested. The applicant clarified that 
experimental set-up (different sessions of transplantations among which the groups are not equally spread) 
and the limited number of animals in the UM group may have contributed to the inter-group variability 
observed in the study.  Exempting these animals as outlier results from the statistical calculation showed that 
there was no real difference between the groups concerning the CD4/CD8 ratio. This explanation and this 
approach can be accepted and also exemplifies the importance of the design of the experimental set-up. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that in a biodistribution study in the the applicant’s programme, also a 
CD4/CD8 ratio ≥1 was observed in young Rag2-/- IL2r-gamma chain-/- mice. This was also observed in 
literature by Traggiai et al. (2004), who reported in their paper that the thymus contained CD4 and CD8 
single positive T cells in 1:1 to 4:1 ratios. Thus, next to the above explanation on different sessions of 
transplantation, the thymic CD4/CD8 ratios appear also to be strain-specific. No effect on the thymic CD4+
and CD8+ subpopulations of MLD patient treated with Libmeldy is expected. Indeed, clinical data obtained so 
far show sufficient thymus engraftment and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in peripheral blood. Vector 
mobilisation from human to mouse cells was not observed in mice transplanted with ARSA LV-transduced 
human CB-derived CD34+ cells, suggesting a low risk of mobilization and transduction of bystander cells, 
including germ cells.
Toxicology studies
Long-term toxicity
Intravenous treatment of As2-/- mice with a single dose of 1x106 ARSA-LV-transduced Lin- HSPCs resulted in 
engraftment and persistence of these cells without considerable product- or ARSA overexpression-related 
toxicity or tumorigenicity. Clinical and (histo)pathological abnormalities found in the mice were related to the 
disease, to aging, and to the pre-conditioning/transplantation regimen. However, although the dose used in 
these studies was higher than currently proposed for humans (which is acceptable for toxicity studies), 
differences in transduction protocol compared to the clinical manufacturing process exist. Therefore these 
studies may be of limited relevance for the clinic. Nevertheless, from these studies can be concluded that 
there appear to be no safety issues, other than issues that are to be expected with ‘normal’ HSPC 
transplantation (including pre-conditioning).
In the non-GLP toxicity studies, ARSA activity appeared to be considerably lower in vivo compared to in vitro 
levels. In some animals, even no ARSA activity could be detected despite positive VCN values. Moreover, 
both in vitro and in vivo VCN values were high, but variable. Most important, there did not appear to be a 
positive relation between in vivo terminal VCN and ARSA activity. According to the applicant, this could be 
the result of in vivo gene silencing (Capotondo et al., 2007, ARSA transgenic mice). However, this hypothesis 
was not further investigated and the clinical relevance of this potential silencing was not discussed. The 
applicant was asked to substantiate their explanation related to the absence of VCN-ARSA activity correlation 
with (literature) data and provide a discussion on the potential mechanism of silencing, including whether this 
occurs in HSCTs and/or (specific lineages of) differentiated cells. Clinically, a more positive VCN-ARSA activity 
correlation appeared to be present. The applicant was asked to elaborate on the potential of occurring of LV 
cassette silencing in patients and the possibility to monitor and/or steer such events.  The applicant provided 
a detailed literature-based overview of the occurrence and potential mechanisms of gene silencing, resulting 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 46/157
 
 
 
in a lack of/reduced transgene expression in (mainly) undifferentiated cells from both animals and human.  
The applicant considered the potential gene silencing in ARSA transgenic mice, which most likely occurred 
due to very high VCN values (in PBMCs), not clinically relevant because VCN in the DP (and in the patients) 
has always been below 10. Nevertheless, these were only mean VCN values and individual cells could have 
considerably higher VCN values (see below, genotoxicity subsection). 
To further support their statement that gene silencing is not clinically relevant, the applicant stated that 
ARSA activity has been stable over time in patients without signs of decline. However, in the CSF of several 
late infantile and pre-symptomatic early juvenile patients, ARSA activity showed a decline.  Nevertheless, 
whether gene silencing would result in a comparable decline or a more extensive decrease in ARSA activity is 
not clear. As such, no conclusion related to the level of ARSA activity and potential gene silencing in MLD 
patients can be drawn.
Considering that LV-related gene silencing has been observed in human cells, there will be a potential that in 
patients infused with ARSA-LV CD34+ HSPCs gene silencing will occur. However, the applicant stated that 
ARSA activity, which is considered an important clinical efficacy endpoint, is monitored closely in treated MLD 
patients. Although potential gene silencing will not be further investigated and it is not clear whether steering 
of such silencing would be possible in humans, close monitoring of both ARSA activity and clinical scoring of 
patients is considered sufficient to detect potential loss of efficacy. 
Risk for mutagenicity
Lentiviral vectors integrate in the host DNA. When insertion occurs in pro-oncogenes or genes protecting cells 
from proliferation, this may have the potential to result in oncogenic transformation.  To address this 
theoretical risk the applicant provided an analysis on insertion site which suggest that -related LV is not 
expected to selectively integrate in narrow genomic regions related to oncogenesis nor close to promoter or 
regulatory elements and would not result in the transformation of cells, thus the mutagenic risk will be 
sufficiently low as LV vectors are not considered to insert in genes related to oncogenicity. The presented 
data included an integration site analysis presented in two reports (Biffi et al., 2011 and Report 
2016N302788) and from the first 7 patients treated with ARSA-LV-transduced HSPCs (Biffi et al., 2013 and 
Sessa et al., 2016). The non-clinical data showed that on the individual gene level, there was no significant 
change in frequency between in vitro and in vivo datasets (CD34+ HSPCs), thus no enrichment in 
preferentially targeted genes when the product is used in vivo. Within these datasets, 31 common integration 
sites (CISs) were identified, although the individual CISs targeted differed considerably between the 
datasets. Nevertheless, the data from a.o. Biffi et al. (2011) showed that integration patterns with the LV 
corresponded largely to those observed for other LVs (i.e. within transcription units and not in 
promoter/regulatory elements). Also, LV CISs did occur in wide regions of high-integration density and not as 
a cluster within a small region (as would occur in case of genotoxic CISs). 
Integration site analyses of patient samples (bone marrow and peripheral blood) from different time points 
post-transplantation confirmed the non-clinical data: LV integration occurred preferentially within 
transcriptional units and there was no outgrowth of specific clones (polyclonal reconstitution), which was 
especially apparent after long-term follow-up. Moreover, the integration patterns between individual patients 
and with patient data from another LV-transduced cell product were comparable (i.e. same gene classes 
preferentially targeted).  These CISs and other overrepresented gene classes are not considered to be related 
to expression of oncogenes or genes associated with cell proliferation.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 47/157
 
 
Nevertheless, integration site analyses data described by the applicant were predominantly derived from the 
first 7 MLD patients, which have been treated with batches with VCN values ranging between 1.7 and 4.4 
copies. At 1-year post-infusion, the mean VCN values in PBMCs of these patients ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 
copies. However, some individual cells have VCN values > 10, which could give rise to a safety concern. 
Moreover, since there appears to be an increase in the percentage of individual cells (colonies) with VCN 
values < 2 in patients compared to the DP, there could be a concern related to sustained efficacy. The 
individual data clarified that most patients had been treated with batches containing a considerable amount 
of individual cells with VCN < 2 or VCN > 10, although the percentage of cells with VCN > 10 decreased 
quickly over time (for most patients until or almost 0%), while the percentage of cells with VCN < 2 
concurrently increased. There was no considerable difference between patients treated recently or years ago. 
Nevertheless, in some patients (e.g. from the compassionate use programme), a high percentage of cells 
with VCN > 10 remained in vivo. Although long-term data from -treated patients (up to 7 years) have not 
shown the in vivo outgrowth of certain cell clones and malignancies, the applicant will continue to monitor 
insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis in the treated patients. It is fully endorsed that individual patients 
are closely and long-term monitored, especially considering that it is not clear what will happen in patients in 
which higher percentages of VCN > 10 colonies will persist. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
Dedicated reproduction and developmental studies were not undertaken. As the transduction of the cells 
occurs ex vivo, the risk for transduction of the gametes and consequently the risk from germline transduction 
is limited and rather theoretical. The applicant addressed the risk of secondary transduction, which appears 
very limited upon the use of clinical-grade viral vector and the presence of human serum. Bystander cell 
transduction, or the potential for vector mobilisation, was not observed to occur in vivo in animals, further 
downgrading the risk of transduction of gametes. Although distribution of ARSA LV transduced CD34+ cells to 
the testis was observed, transfer of the transgene to the male gametes is thus not foreseen. There is no 
information on the distribution of ARSA LV transduced CD34+ cells in the ovaria, but it is regarded that the 
absence of bystander cell transduction holds also true for the female gametes. The absence of dedicated 
studies addressing the reproductive and developmental toxicity can thus be agreed upon.
Taken together, the (long-term) toxicity studies did not indicate existence of safety issues related to 
transplantation with ARSA LV transduced autologous murine Lin- or human CD34+ HSPCs, other than issues 
that are to be expected with ‘normal’ HSPC transplantation. The evaluation of the insertion site analysis data 
revealed that a mutagenic risk that may have the potential to result in oncogenic transformation related to 
the treatment of autologous cells with ARSA-LV is estimated to be very low and can be considered rather 
theoretical.  Nevertheless, individual patients will be closely and long-term monitored to further follow-up 
potential efficacy- or safety-related concerns. 
ERA 
According to the applicant’s assessment, the outcome of the environmental risk assessment is a negligible 
risk for human health and the environment. It is agreed that the risks to the environment related to the 
transduced cells are negligible. It is also agreed that the risk to the environment of the residual infectious 
particles in the product can be considered negligible.  Overall, with the implementation of the control 
measures described by the applicant the overall risks for human health are considered negligible.
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

2.5.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects
Pharmacodynamic studies investigating the treatment of MLD mice through transplanting murine equivalent 
HSPCs transduced with ARSA-LV show proof of principle for the proposed clinical treatment. However, insight 
in the VCN-ARSA relationship and the relationship between minimal ARSA levels in brain and the efficacy of 
the treatment cannot be fully provided (because of lack of individual murine data) and these potential 
relationships are not to be directly translated to the clinic. Supportive information on the VCN-ARSA 
relationship, the minimal ARSA activity requirement for clinical efficacy and for efficacious treatment in 
different patient populations is expected to be part of the quality and clinical modules. 
The pharmacokinetic studies with either mouse equivalent cells in wild type or diseased mice or with human 
cells in immune-compromised animals show that genetically modified (CD34+) HSPCs distribute and 
repopulate also the brain. Animal data suggest that this occurs most efficiently upon busulfan myeloablative 
pre-conditioning. Furthermore, the ARSA enzyme is not likely to be transduced over the BBB. Therefore, 
restoring ARSA activity in the brain is rather dependent on reconstitution of µ-cells from ARSA-LV 
transduced-and-engrafted HSPCs. These cells express and secrete functional ARSA that can also cross-correct 
the disease phenotype in endogenous neurons and glial cells (that have taken up ARSA from the transduced 
cells) as is shown in As2-/- mice transplanted with ARSA-HA LV Lin-HSPCs. 
The toxicity studies do not indicate safety concerns associated with the treatment with ARSA-LV transduced 
HSPCs. Transduction of HSPCs with ARSA seems not to reveal an oncogenic risk, but long-term follow-up of 
the treated MLD patients will be needed. 
Vector mobilisation from human to mouse cells was not observed in mice transplanted with ARSA LV-
transduced human CB-derived CD34+ cells, confirming that ARSA-LV distributed stably associated with the 
human genome and is not transferred into genomes of the transplanted mice cells, suggesting a low risk of 
mobilization and transduction of bystander cells, including germ cells.
It is agreed with the applicant, that this product poses a negligible risk for human health and the 
environment. 
From a non-clinical point of view, there are no objections against a MA.
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

No formal PK assessment has been performed, this is acceptable. The reflection paper on stem cell-based 
medicinal products (EMA/CAT/571134/2009) points out that the effect of different doses/cell numbers should 
be addressed during the nonclinical phase and confirmed during the clinical studies. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 50/157
 
 
PK assessments were performed for the conditioning regimens and will be discussed below.
Exposure busulfan conditioning
The conditioning regimen initially implemented in the OTL-200-f clinical development programme consisted of 
14 doses of busulfan (according to subject’s weight; submyeloblative conditioning regimen (SMAC)). 
Subsequently, the conditioning regimen was modified with the goal of reducing the variability of transduced 
cell engraftment and designed to produce a higher cumulative busulfan AUC. This new conditioning regimen 
consisted of body surface area-based dosing of busulfan according to the subject's age (myeloablative 
conditioning regimen (MAC)). In the Integrated Safety Set, 13 subjects (45%) were treated with a SMAC 
regimen, defined as a target cumulative AUC of 67,200 μg*h/L (target range 58,800 to 78,400 μg*h/L). 
Sixteen subjects (55%) were administered the MAC regimen, defined as a target cumulative AUC of 
85,000 μg*h/L (target range: 76,500 to 93,500 μg*h/L).
For SMAC busulfan plasma levels were monitored by serial pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling and adjusted using 
a target dose area under the curve (AUC) of 4800 μg*h/L (range: 4200 to 5600 μg*h/L), which corresponds 
to an expected total cumulative AUC of 67,200 µg*h/L (range 58,800 to 78,400 g*h/L). Busulfan plasma 
levels were monitored by timed sampling following the first and the 5th or 6th dose (depending on PK-based 
dose adjustment requirements). The 5th and subsequent doses of busulfan were adjusted using the area 
under the curve (AUC), derived after the first dose. An additional adjustment at the 9th or 10th dose could be 
made depending on the AUC value derived after the 5th or 6th dose. For MAC the second and subsequent 
doses were adjusted based on the AUC derived after the first dose. The adjustment was performed using a 
target total cumulative AUC of 85,000 μg*h/L (range: 76,500 to 93,500 μg*h/L). A further adjustment could 
be made at the third dose based on the AUC values derived from the second dose.
As it would be expected, subjects who received a SMAC regimen received a lower total dose (mg) and lower 
total dose per body weight (mg/kg) than subjects who received a MAC regimen (Table 1).
The disease subtypes were disproportionately represented in the subgroup who received the SMAC regimen; 
9 of 13 subjects (69%) were LI subjects versus 4 of 13 EJ subjects (31%).

The mean cumulative AUC in subjects who received a SMAC regimen was higher than expected (geometric 
mean 71,923.53; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 68,751.04, 75,242.41), but the mean remained within the 
target range (Table 2). Two subjects received SMAC regimens but had AUCs within the MAC range 
(84,305 μg*h/L and 78,572 μg*h/L). The mean cumulative AUC in subjects who received a MAC regimen was 
consistent with the target AUC (geometric mean 84,043.08; 95% CI: 75,543.86, 81,314.89).
There was low variability in busulfan AUC for both SMAC and MAC regimens (CV 7.5% and 3.5%, 
respectively). The average exposure to the MAC regimen was 14% higher than the average exposure to the 
SMAC regimen.

The cumulative AUC in 2 subjects who received a SMAC regimen was outside the target range; therefore, the 
applicant also analysed data by total AUC. When exposure was defined in the conditioning regimens based on 
the total AUC threshold of 76,500 μg*h/L, a larger proportion of subjects (18 subjects, 62%) received a total 
AUC >76,500 μg*h/L compared with the proportion of subjects with AUC threshold ≤76,500 μg*h/L (11 
subjects, 38%) (Table 3).

In Study 205756 of OTL-200-c, all 4 subjects received a MAC regimen. The total dose of busulfan received 
ranged from 11.48 mg/kg to 14.56 mg/kg. The mean observed cumulative AUC in these subjects was 
80009.25 μg*h/L (range: 79965, 80058 μg*h/L), showing little variation from the target exposure.
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics
No dedicated pharmacodynamics study was performed, instead various pharmacodynamic parameters were 
measured in all clinical studies of Libmeldy. These include engraftment of transduced cells (in bone marrow 
(BM), peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] and cell subpopulations) and ARSA activity (in bone 
marrow, in PBMCs and cell subpopulations, and in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]).  
The Integrated efficacy data set includes data from subjects treated with the fresh OTL-200-f formulation in 
the registrational Study (Study 201222 [n=20], the core data set) and patients treated under the 3 
Expanded Access Programmes (n=9). The subjects included were diagnosed with either LI MLD or EJ MLD 
and could be symptomatic or pre-symptomatic (See clinical efficacy for a more detailed description of the 
population).  
The design of the pivotal study and expanded access programmes was comparable, e.g. Screening phase, 
Baseline phase, Treatment phase and Follow Up phase. The target dose was 5 × 106 to 10 × 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg (minimum dose 2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg, maximum dose 20 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg), dependent on 
the yield of cells following DP manufacturing. The source material was either collected from bone marrow 
harvest or mobilised peripheral blood apheresis. The doses given varied within the pre-defined dose range in 
the study protocol.

Transduced Cell Engraftment in BM-Derived Clonogenic Progenitor Cells
Across the OTL-200-f Integrated Efficacy Set, the proportion of BM-derived colonies harboring the LV genome 
(percentage LV+) at Year 1 after treatment was 54.8% (range 20% to 100% [n=23]). At Year 5, that 
proportion was 45.0% (range 18.8% to 90.6% [n=6]).
At all timepoints evaluated, geometric mean LV+ values cells in BM were higher in the LI subgroup than in 
the EJ subgroup, although the 95% CIs overlapped (See Figure 2).
Figure 2:
Percentage of Lentiviral Vector Transduced Cells in Bone Marrow Over Time (Geometric Mean 
and 95% CI), OTL-200-f Treated Subjects by Disease Subtype (Integrated Efficacy Set)
VCN values in total PBMCs also indicated engraftment of transduced cell  beginning at 28 days post 
treatment. The mean value was mean 0.19 copies/cell [range 0.03 to 0.68] (n=29), thus above the minimum 
target defined in the protocol, i.e., ≥0.04 copies/cell, equivalent to 4%. 
In both the LI and EJ subgroups, the VCN in total PBMCs initially increased over time and remained relatively 
stable from 3months  post-treatment throughout the course of follow-up (See Figure 3)

values are plotted as plotted at 0.001. Geometric means and 95% CIs are presented where there are at least 3 subjects 
with non-missing data.
ARSA activity 
Measurement of the reconstitution of ARSA activity in the haematopoietic system was performed on PBMCs, 
BM MNC, and other PB and BM subpopulations. ARSA activity in CSF was also quantified to provide indirect 
evidence that transduced cells have migrated to the CNS and are producing and secreting functional ARSA 
enzyme.
ARSA Activity in Total Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells
The ARSA activity in the PBMCs increased within 1 month and at 3 months was at levels higher than reported 
for healthy subjects. At Year 2 post treatment (the time of the primary endpoint), a statistically significant 
increase in ARSA activity in total PBMCs for both the LI (18.7-fold increase; 95% CI: 8.3, 42.2; p<0.001) and 
EJ (5.7-fold increase; 95% CI: 2.6, 12.4; p<0.001) subgroups compared to baseline levels was observed. 
The statistically significant increase in ARSA activity in total PBMCs also remained in both the LI (37.5-fold 
increase; 95% CI: 17.7, 79.6; p<0.001) and EJ (11.2-fold increase; 95% CI: 5.7, 21.9 p<0.001) subgroups 
compared with Baseline levels at Year 3.
ARSA Activity in MNC
Consistent with ARSA activity in PBMCs, mean ARSA activity levels in total BM MNC also increased 
substantially within 1 month after treatment. By 3 months post treatment, mean ARSA activity levels in total 
BM MNC were 7.5-fold higher than Baseline in LI subjects and 6.3-fold higher than Baseline in EJ subjects 
(p<0.001 for all).  Throughout the course of follow-up, mean ARSA levels in total BM MNC remained at least 
7.5-fold and at least 5.3-fold higher than Baseline in LI and EJ subjects, respectively. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 55/157
 
 
ARSA Activity in CSF 
At Baseline, ARSA activity levels in CSF in all subjects were below the LLOQ (0.0032 nmol/mg/h). following 
treatment, ARSA activity levels in all subjects were detectable by Month 6, with a mean level of 0.42 
nmol/mg/h (range 0.13 to 102). At Year 1 post treatment the mean ARSA activity in the CSF was 0.739 
nmol/mg/h for the LI MLD group and 0.473 nmol/mg/h for the EJ MLD group. Although there is a fluctuation 
in CSF ARSA activity levels, the activity levels remain within ranges reported for healthy subjects up to 5 
years post treatment (Figure 4).

Correlation curves
Specific focus was on the correlations of CD34+/kg dose multiplied by VCN (CD34+ * VCN) as a measure of 
product potency.
At 6 months and 12 months post-treatment, statistically significant correlations between CD34+ * VCN and 
VCN in total PBMCs were observed (corr=0.605, p=0.002; corr=0.556, p=0.003 at 6 months and 12 months 
respectively) (Figure 5).

The applicant indicates that no relevant correlations were observed between CQA of OTL-200-f DP and clinical 
biomarkers at 2 years and 3 years post-treatment.
When clinical samples at different timepoints post gene-therapy were evaluated for potential relationships 
between mean VCN and ARSA activity in total PBMCs, statistically significant correlations between VCN in 
PBMCs and ARSA activity in PBMCs  were observed at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years post-treatment 
(see Figure 6).

Note by Assessor: The information on the axes and legends are not very clear. In all Figures the ARSA Activity is presented 
on the X-axes and the VCN on the Y-axes. The X-axes ranges from 0-2500 (500 interval), 0-6000 (2000 interval), 0-6000 
(1000 interval) and 0-4000 (1000 interval) for panel A, B, C and D respectively. On the Y-Axes in al panels, the interval is 
1. The soled thick line is the regression line, the blue area is the confidence interval of the regression curve and the dotted 
line indicates the 95% prediction limits.
No relevant correlations were observed between levels of ARSA activity in CSF and motor function, cognition 
or MRI total scores in any of the MLD variant and timepoints evaluated (2 Years and 3 Years post treatment) 
(see Table 4). The applicant concludes that due to lack of a correlation the minimal ARSA activity level in CSF 
to achieve efficacy and maintenance of effect could not be determined.
Table 4:
Correlations Between ARSA in CSF and Clinical Efficacy Outcomes
Conditioning regimen
Transduced cell engraftment by conditioning regimen
A similar percentage of LV-transduced HSPCs (or their progeny) was measured over time in BM after MAC 
and SMAC or when the conditioning subgroups were defined based on an AUC threshold of 76,500 μg*h/L 
(see clinical AR for figures). In addition, there was no clear correlation between busulfan exposure, as 
measured by total AUC, and the proportion of LV-positive cells (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.117).
There were no differences in the level of transduced cell engraftment, as measured by VCN in BM and PBMCs, 
in the subgroups of subjects who received MAC vs. SMAC or when the conditioning subgroups were defined 
EMA/584450/2020

based on an AUC threshold of 76,500 μg*h/L (see clinical AR for figures). In addition, there was no clear 
correlation between busulfan exposure and the VCN per cell in BM or PBMCs (Spearman rank correlation 
coefficient: -0.015 and -0.048, respectively).
ARSA activity by conditioning regimen
The increase in ARSA activity in PBMCs at Year 2 was similar in the subgroup of subjects who received SMAC 
(10.4-fold [range 1.00 to 226.56]) and in the subgroup of subjects who received MAC (10.7-fold [range 2.70 
to 75.33]). Similar increases were also observed in BM-derived MNCs at Year 2 (SMAC: 6.4-fold [range 1.5 to 
21.8]); MAC 11.0-fold [range 4.74 to 63.76])
In CSF, mean ARSA activity was slightly higher in the SMAC subgroup at Year 2 (geometric mean 
0.954 nmol/mg/h [range 0.60 to 1.99 nmol/mg/h]) than in the MAC subgroup (geometric mean 
0.547 nmol/mg/h [range 0.13 to 0.92 nmol/mg/h]). This difference was smaller when the conditioning 
subgroups were defined as total AUC threshold of ≤76,500 μg*h/L vs. >76,500 μg*h/L (1.5-fold difference 
between Year 2 geometric means of 0.934 nmol/mg/h [range 0.60 to 1.99] and 0.615 nmol/mg/h [range 
0.13 to 1.06 nmol/mg/h] respectively) (Figure 7).

2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
A conventional clinical pharmacology programme (dose escalation/dose range finding, human absorption, 
metabolism and excretion, drug-drug interaction, and special population studies) for Libmeldy was not 
considered feasible, which is agreed. A range of doses, various pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) parameters were measured in the clinical studies of Libmeldy.
Pharmacokinetics
Two different regimens were used in the clinical development programme. Thirteen patients (45%) were 
treated with SMAC (submyeloablative conditioning regimen) with a median AUC of 70,841.00 μg*h/L (min 
63,420.0; max 84,305.0). Two subjects (Patient 1 and 2)  received SMAC regimens but had AUCs within the 
MAC range. The PK monitoring and dose adjustments used for these two subjects  were based on a target 
single AUC. Next, the protocol was adjusted to reduce the risk of busulfan overexposure observed in these 
two subjects . In the adjusted protocol monitoring was based on a total cumulative target AUC. Afterwards, 
all subjects conditioned with either regimen (MAC or SMAC) have shown total cumulative AUC within the pre-
specified protocol range. Sixteen patients (55%) received the MAC (myeloablative regimen) and all patients 
had an AUC within the target range. Median AUC was 84,987.00 μg*h/L (min 78,000.0; max 88,310.0). The 
average exposure to the MAC regimen was 14% higher than the average exposure to the SMAC regimen. The 
disease subtypes (LI MLD and EJ MLD) where disproportionally represented in the different regimen groups. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 60/157
 
 
Furthermore, the dose levels differed between the subgroups. It is not possible to conclude with the data 
available if different dose levels would have been required with different disease subtypes. 
Pharmacodynamics
The engraftment of lentiviral vector positive cells is higher in both LI MLD and EJ MLD than the predefined 
threshold of 4%. The engraftment of the lentiviral vector positive cells remained stable over time. At 2 years 
post treatment there was an overlap in engraftment of the total mononuclear cells in the bone marrow, 
between the LI and EJ subvariants. Although the geometric mean VCN/cell was higher for the LI subvariant 
(0.815 [95% CI 0.422; 1.577]) than for the EJ subvariant (0.463 [95%CI 0.254; 0.843]) (total MNC in BM). 
It is unclear if this is related to the switch from SMAC to MAC busulfan regimen during the development of 
the clinical programme, as there is an imbalance in representation of SMAC and MAC. A similar effect, e.g. 
sustained engraftment of lentiviral vector positive cells irrespective of disease variant, was also observed for 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] and cell subpopulations (e.g. CD34+).
Supra physiological ARSA enzyme activity levels were observed in PBMCs, and BM in both LI MLD and EJ MLD 
subjects treated with Libmeldy. The ARSA activity levels in the CSF were similar to that of healthy subjects.
The plots showing a correlation between CD34+cells/kg * VCN and VCN in PBMCs should be interpreted with 
caution considering that the majority of show a VCN in PBMCs between 0 and 1, irrespective of dose 
administered. The same caution should be applied for the presented correlation between VNC in PBMC and 
ARSA activity in PBMC. Insufficient data is available above PBMC VCN levels of 1 to enable definite 
conclusions. Nevertheless, clinically it appears that even the lowest VCN achieved in this trial is sufficient to 
provide ARSA activity levels in the CSF similar to what has been reported for healthy subjects.
The applicant modified the conditioning regimen from SMAC to MAC to reduce variability of transduced cell 
engraftment. The rationale for the applicant to change the conditioning regimen was based on preliminary 
analysis of the data from the first 9 patients enrolled in Study 201222 and treated with the SMAC regimen. 
Whilst engraftment was sustained in all of these subjects, the level of transduced cells engraftment was 
variable with values ranging from 25% to 80% of LV positive forming cells in BM. In addition, ARSA activity 
seemed to be positively correlated with engraftment values, with ARSA activity reaching normal and above 
normal values in patients with the highest transduced cell engraftment. In order to improve the therapeutic 
potential of Libmeldy on both the CNS and PNS by reducing transduced cell engraftment variability and 
increasing engraftment levels, the applicant modified the conditioning regimen (to MAC regimen) with the 
aim to increase busulfan exposure by approximately 10% of the total AUC. Both the percentage of LV-
transduced cells in BM and VCN in BM and PMBCs were overlapping between the SMAC and MAC regimen, 
although the sample sizes are small. There is therefore no conclusive evidence that the use of MAC leads to 
higher engraftment levels. Also ARSA activity in total PBMCs and BM over time did not seem to differ between 
SMAC vs MAC. For both SMAC and MAC ARSA levels in CSF reached normal values after Libmeldy treatment. 
Interestingly, for ARSA activity in CSF the curves for SMAC and total AUC ≤76,500 μg*h/L are above the 
curves for MAC and total AUC >76,500 μg*h/L. Definitive conclusions are, however, difficult to make due to 
the small patient numbers and the imbalance in clinical subtype of patients treated with SMAC or MAC 
regimen with a disproportionate representation of LI subjects in the SMAC subgroup. Although the data in the 
Libmeldy studies do not show clear differences in terms of engraftment efficiency and ARSA activity between 
SMAC and MAC, the applicant prefers to use the MAC regimen in clinical practice. This is based on literature 
showing that in children and young adults treated with allogenic haematopoietic cell transplantation for a 
variety of malignant and non-malignant disorders a target cumulative AUC of busulfan between 78,000-
101,000 μg*h/L provides the busulfan exposure-response relationship with optimal efficacy. Furthermore, 
higher levels of myeloablative conditioning obtained with MAC are preferable in neurometabolic disorders 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 61/157
 
 
according to the applicant to enable an intense brain conditioning to successfully remove resident microglia 
and favour high central engraftment of genetically modified cells.
Based on the provided data it is not possible to have one of the regimens as preferred choice and section 5.1 
of the SmPC describes that the choice is up to the treating physician based on an individual benefit/risk 
assessment. 
No correlation was found between ARSA activity CSF level and any of the clinical outcome measures 
examined, i.e. GMFM, GMFC-MLD,DQ and MRI. The applicant indicates that the minimum ARSA activity level 
in the CSF required for efficacy could not be determined, due to lack of a correlation. This is not agreed. 
Figure 13 below shows that although the subjects performed better than subjects from the NHx cohort, 
deterioration was observed in motor function assessed by GMFM in per-symptomatic LI-MLD subjects who 
had ARSA activity levels of 07.1nmol/mg/hr and 0.37nmol/mg/hr. Therefore, levels below 0.71nmol/mg/hr 
could be indicative for treatment effect. It is unclear if this could also be the threshold for EJ-MLD subjects as 
that group consisted of pre-symptomatic, early-symptomatic and symptomatic subjects. The ARSA activity 
levels required for an effect for these stages may be different. The relationship between CSF protein content 
and ARSA activity levels will be further established post marketing. This will allow evaluation of ARSA CSF 
activity as predicting factor for treatment success or explanation of failure.
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The engraftment parameter for lentiviral vector positive cells set by the applicant, i.e. >4% is met, 
irrespective of disease subvariant, busulfan conditioning, dose used, or formulation used. Supra-physiological 
ARSA activity values are measured in the PBMC and MNCs, however from non-clinical data it is known that 
supratherapeutic levels do not pose a risk. 
It should be noted that for the majority of the subjects the ARSA activity within the CSF after treatment was 
within ranges reported for healthy subjects.
The clinical pharmacology data were considered adequate to support the application.
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as described 
above. 
2.7.  Clinical efficacy
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies
No formal dose response study was performed. The applicant based the dose on doses described in literature. 
The applicant has improved the yield of CD34+ cells harvest and mobilization and also the dose administered 
range from 2.0x106 – 20x106 CD34+cells/kg to a range of 3.0x106-30x106 CD34+cells/kg, during the course 
of the clinical programme. 
The proposed dose range i.e. number of transfected cells can be safely administered, as this was done for 
several other studies using LV. However, there is no direct correlation between VCN and ARSA activity levels 
in the CSF. This issue is not pursued as ARSA activity in all measured sources, e.g. PBM, CSF, cell type etc., 
are within or above the normal range.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 62/157
 
 
It should also be noted that non clinical data indicate that ARSA activity levels higher than reported for 
healthy subjects do not lead to unfavourable effects.  
Main study
Registration Study/ Study 201222
Methods
Study 201222 was a non-randomised, open-label-, prospective, comparative (non-concurrent control), single 
centre study. The study consisted of 4 phases: 1) Screening phase (evaluation in/exclusion criteria), 2) 
Baseline phase, 3) Treatment phase (cell harvest for investigational DP manufacture on day -4, busulfan 
conditioning (Day -4 to Day -1, administration of LIBMELDY on Day 0) and 4) a Follow up phase (8 years) 
(see Figure 8).
Figure 8: Study Diagram
Study Participants
A total of 22 MLD subjects, 9 LI MLD and 13 EJ MLD confirmed by ARSA enzymatic activity and genetic 
analysis were included in the study. All LI study subjects and some EJ subjects were identified after an older 
sibling had developed symptoms and received an MLD diagnosis, prompting the testing of other family 
members. 
All 9, LI subjects were all pre-symptomatic upon enrolment, defined as subjects without neurological 
impairment or without symptoms or signs of MLD, however, one subject became symptomatic prior to 
treatment with Libmeldy. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 63/157
 
 
For the EJ MLD, 4 subjects were pre-symptomatic and 8 were early-symptomatic defined as subject identified 
within 6 months from the first reported symptoms or subjects meeting with an intelligence quotient (IQ) ≥70 
and the ability to walk independently for ≥10 steps. 
Comparator population
Data from TIGET NHx Study consists of a cohort of 31 untreated LI and EJ MLD subjects. The data contain a 
mixture of cross-sectional and longitudinal data with some subjects contributing data at multiple time points 
while other providing data from a single visit, possibly because subjects may not have been able to travel for 
clinic visits due to disease progression or may have died prior to providing longitudinal data.
Matched sibling data was available for 9 subjects treated in study 201222. 
Treatments
The planned minimum dose was 2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg, with a target of 5 × 106 to 10 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
(maximum dose 20 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg), dependent on the yield of cells following DP manufacturing.
Busulfan conditioning regimen
Rationale conditioning regimen
The conditioning regimen initially implemented in the Libmeldy-f clinical development programme consisted 
of 14 doses of busulfan (according to subject’s weight). Subsequently, the conditioning regimen was modified 
with the goal of reducing the variability of transduced cell engraftment and designed to produce a higher 
cumulative busulfan AUC. This new conditioning regimen consisted of body surface area-based dosing of 
busulfan according to the subject's age. Both conditioning regimens will be discussed in more detail below.
Submyeloblative conditioning regimen (SMAC)
Subjects prescribed a SMAC regimen received body weight-based doses of IV busulfan according to the 
schematic in Table 5.

Subjects received a total of 14 doses, given as a 2-hour infusion administered every 6 hours from Day -4 to 
Day -1. Busulfan plasma levels were monitored by serial pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling (see PK section) and 
adjusted using a target dose area under the curve (AUC) of 4800 μg*h/L (range: 4200 to 5600 μg*h/L), 
which corresponds to an expected total cumulative AUC of 67,200 µg*h/L (range 58,800 to 78,400 g*h/L).
In the registrational study (201222), subjects enrolled prior to January 2014 (9 subjects) were treated with 
this SMAC regimen. Four EAP Patients (Patient 22, 24, 25, 29) also received the SMAC regimen.
Myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC)
Subjects prescribed a MAC regimen received a body surface area (Mosteller’s formula)-based dose of 
busulfan according to the subject’s age (Table 6).
EMA/584450/2020

Table 6:
Busulfan Dosage According to Patient’s Age (MAC Regimen)
80 mg/m2/dose
>1 year of age
120 mg/m2/dose
Under this MAC regimen, subjects received a total of 4 doses, administered as a 3-hour IV infusion every 20 
to 24 hours from Day -4 to Day -1. PK monitoring is described in the PK section.
Subjects treated after January 2014 (11 subjects) in the registrational study (Study 201222) received this 
MAC regimen. Five patients in the EAPs (Patient 21, 23, 26, 27, 28) were also administered the MAC 
regimen. All 4 subjects enrolled in Study 205756 at the time of data cut received the MAC regimen.
Objectives
The objectives of this ongoing study are as follows:


Evaluation of the safety of Libmeldy-f in MLD subjects, considering both the conditioning regimen 
safety and the safety of LV-transduced cell administration, short- and long-term after the treatment
Evaluation of the efficacy of Libmeldy-f, assessed as reduction in the progression of the clinical motor 
impairment in treated subjects compared to the progression measured in untreated MLD subjects 
within the Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET) Natural History (NHx) Study (TIGET NHx 
Study; Study number 204949), accompanied by a significant increase of residual ARSA activity as 
compared to subjects’ pre-treatment values. Motor functions will be measured by the clinically 
relevant GMFM scoring system
Outcomes/endpoints
Clinical efficacy was primary based on the Gross Motor Function Measure score (GMFM). The total GMFM 
score two years after treatment was the primary endpoint. A delay in progression of 10% in total of the total 
GMFM score in treated subjects as compared to a concurrent historical control group was the aimed effect 
size.  
The co-primary endpoint was the ARSA activity (PBMC and CSF). A significant (≥2 SD) increase in residual 
ARSA activity measured in the BPBMC at two years as compared to pre-treatment values, was the aimed 
effect size.  
Secondary endpoints included nerve conduction velocity (NCV), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
gross motor function classification (GMFC-MLD, neuropsychological tests, neurological evaluations, survival, 
engraftment (lentiviral vector transduced cells, vector copy number [VCN]). The study included comparison 
to a natural history cohort (NHx) and where available untreated siblings.

Statistical methods
The All Subjects population includes all subjects enrolled in Study 201222 and subjects enrolled in Study 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 65/157
 
 
204949 (TIGET NHx Study) with disease subtype LI or EJ.
The TIGET NHx population includes all subjects enrolled in the TIGET NHx Study with disease subtype LI or 
EJ and who are not also enrolled in Study 201222.
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included any subject enrolled into Study 201222 who met the inclusion 
criteria at Screening, had a signed informed consent form (ICF), and had received treatment with Libmeldy-
f.
The Matched Analysis Set (MAS) population includes subjects in the ITT population and any age and MLD 
variant-matched untreated subjects from TIGET NHx Study who provided control data for comparison 
purposes. Matched untreated participants are defined as subjects with LI or EJ MLD or clinical variant of 
intermediate severity between the classical LI and EJ forms in the TIGET NHx Study who had a study visit 
where their age (at the study visit) fit within the window of ages for Libmeldy-f-treated subjects in Study 
201222. For each MLD subtype (i.e., LI or EJ), at the 2-year and 3-year analysis time points, the lower 
bound of the age window was based on the lowest age of a treated subject in Study 201222 minus 3 months 
and the upper bound was the highest age of a treated subject in Study 201222. For example, if the age 
range at the 2-year post-GT visit of the treated subjects in the LI subgroup was 43 to 55 months, then any 
LI participant from the TIGET NHx Study with a visit where their age was between 40 and 55 months was 
included. If more than 1 visit occurred within the age window and had non-missing data, then the earliest 
visit was used.
The Matched Sibling Analysis Set population includes subjects in the ITT population who had an untreated 
sibling in the TIGET NHx Study and included the corresponding untreated sibling(s) from the TIGET NHx 
Study.
The Safety population includes any subject enrolled in Study 201222 who received Libmeldy-f.
The study population analyses were based on the All Subjects population, unless otherwise specified. 
Summaries were generated by LI and EJ subgroups in addition to the overall total, unless otherwise specified.
Efficacy Analysis
The efficacy analyses were based on the populations defined above and on evaluations at Year 2, with 
efficacy evaluations also performed at Year 3.
Primary efficacy endpoints
The total GMFM score two years after treatment was the primary endpoint. The co-primary endpoint was the 
ARSA activity (in PBMC). A significant (≥2 SD) increase in residual ARSA activity measured in the PBMC at 
two years as compared to pre-treatment values, was the aimed effect size.  
The GMFM data at Year 2 and 3 were analysed, for the LI and EJ subgroups separately, using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model fitting age and treatment (Libmeldy-f or TIGET NHx). Age was fitted in months 
for the LI subjects and in years for the EJ subjects.
The data variability may be small for the TIGET NHx group since they are likely to be in the advanced stage 
of the disease and have lower GMFM scores. For the treated subjects, if treatment is effective, the scores 
could be better and show larger variability. Therefore, the variability for treated and for TIGET NHx groups 
were estimated from the model separately with different parameters.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 66/157
 
 
ARSA activity measured in total PBMC after treatment was compared with the pre-treatment values. ARSA 
summaries for all visits and ARSA ratio relative to the Baseline visit at all post-Baseline visits were presented 
by disease subtype and overall, and separately by busulfan conditioning regimen. The ARSA log transformed 
data were analysed using a mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model fitting Baseline, visit, visit by 
Baseline interaction, disease subtype, and disease subtype by visit interaction as fixed effects and back 
transformed to produce estimates in the original scale. The adjusted LS means, the 95% CI of the adjusted 
LS means, the adjusted LS mean ratio, the 95% CI for the adjusted LS mean ratio, and the p-value for the 
ratio will be presented for each visit in order to assess if there has been a statistically significant increase in 
the ARSA activity from Baseline. The ratio from Baseline is considered statistically significant if the associated 
p-value is <0.05.
Participant flow
As shown in Figure 9, a total of 22 subjects were screened and enrolled into Study 201222. Two of these 22 
subjects were withdrawn from the trial prior to treatment. One EJ subject was withdrawn by the investigator 
at the Baseline visit due to rapid disease progression. The second subject withdrew consent prior to 
treatment.

Numbers analysed
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population includes any subject enrolled into Study 201222 who met the inclusion 
criteria at Screening, had a signed informed consent form (ICF), and had received treatment with Libmeldy-f.
The study included a total of 22 subject, 9 LI-MLD subjects (8 presymptomatic at time of infusion), 11 EJ-
MLD subjects (4 subjects presymtomatic at time of infusion) and 2 EJ-MLD subjects withdrew before 
treatment. The one symptomatic subject in the LI group became symptomatic just prior to treatment.

Demographics and Baseline Characteristics of EJ-MLD subjects is presented Table 8 for the 4 pre-
symptomatic EJ-MLD subjects and Table 9 for the 7 (early) symptomatic EJ-MLD subjects. The median age at 
the time of treatment was 66.8 months in the EJ subgroup (range: 18.8 to 139.9 months).
Pre-symptomatic EJ MLD
Among the EJ MLD group, 4 of 11 (36%) subjects were pre-symptomatic at Screening and Baseline (including 
one subject- Patient 10 , who was considered to be affected by a clinical variant of intermediate severity 
between the classical LI and EJ forms of MLD) (See Table 8). The mean predicted age of onset was 60.1 
months. 
One subject (Patient 13)had abnormal neurological exam findings at both Screening and Baseline that 
consisted of brisk tendon reflexes with clonus in lower limbs and mild cerebellar ataxia with dysmetria

ARSA ACTIVITY IN THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID
Late Infantile MLD (LI MLD)
At Baseline, ARSA activity levels in CSF in all LI MLD subjects were below the LLOQ (0.0032 nmol/mg/h). 
Post treatment, ARSA activity levels in the CSF were detectable by Month 6 and levels of 0.9745 nmol/mg/h 
were reached at 1-year post treatment. The average ARSA activity in the CSF for the LI MLD subjects

measured 5 years post treatment was 0.4726 nmol/mg/h. Individual panel plots for the LI MLD group are 
shown in Figure 10 below.

Note: The reference range represents data from a cohort of paediatric reference donors as per Perugia reference report.
Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD
Similar to the effects reported in the LI MLD subjects, for the EJ MLD subjects the ARSA activity levels in the 
CSF increased from levels below detection limit to within ranges reported for healthy subjects. The ARSA 
activity levels in all subjects were detectable by Month 6, with a mean level of 0.47 nmol/mg/h (95% CI: 
0.34, 0.65 and a mean level of 0.6352 nmol/mg/h 1-year post treatment. At 5 years post treatment the 
mean ARSA activity in the CSF was 1.67 nmol/mg/h for the overall EJ group. The individual panel plots for 
the pre-symptomatic EJ MLD subjects is presented in Figure 11  and for the symptomatic EJ MLD subject in

GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION MEASUREMENT SCORE
Late Infantile MLD (LI MLD)
At year 2 post treatment, mean total GMFM score in the Libmeldy treated LI subjects was 72.5 compared to 
7.4 for the NHx subjects (Difference 65.1 points, 95%CI 41.6; 88.6), p<0.001).
GMFM total score (%) and domain profiles for MLD subjects who received Libmeldy-f (blue open circles) and 
untreated MLD subjects enrolled in the TIGET NHx study are presented graphically in Figure 13.  A Bayesian 
credible interval was fitted as a function of age for healthy children and represented by the grey solid area in 
the figures. The predicted median score for healthy children is represented by the grey line. In addition, each 
Libmeldy-f-treated subject’s predicted or actual age of disease onset is shown as a vertical dotted line.

As shown in Figure 13, gross motor function is clearly higher in the majority of LI subjects treated with 
Libmeldy-f when compared with their untreated siblings and untreated LI TIGET NHx Study participants. The 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 74/157
 
 
majority of treated LI subjects (7/9, 78%) have reached or have been followed up beyond the age at which 
their index case had either died or were bedridden.
Among the 8 pre-symptomatic LI subjects at the time of treatment, 4 subjects  were within the range of 
gross motor function observed in a healthy cohort of children from Palisano (1997) of similar chronological 
age throughout their follow-up and were consistent with the physiological progressive acquisition of new 
motor skills (Palisano, 1997).
The 4 pre-symptomatic LI subjects who showed GMFM scores post-GT below scores from the healthy cohort 
at a similar age all had abnormal neurological examination findings at Baseline.
Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD
For the overall EJ MLD subgroup the mean total GMFM score at 2 years was 76.5 for the Libmeldy treatment 
group compared to 36.6 points for the historical (Difference 39.8 points 95%CI 9.6; 80.1, p=0.026).
pre-symptomatic EJ MLD
For the pre-symptomatic EJ MLD, the adjusted LS mean GMFM total score at year 2 post treatment was 
96.7%. Difference from the NHx group was 52.4% (95% CI 25.1; 79.6, p=0.008) at year 2.  
Individual panel plots are presented in Figure 14.

Symptomatic EJ MLD
For the symptomatic EJ MLD, the adjusted LS mean GMFM total score at year 2 post treatment was 60.7%. 
Difference from the NHx group was 28.7% (95% CI -14.1; 71.5, p=0.35) at year 2.  At Year 3 there was a 
difference in treatment effect of 43.9% (59.8% vs. 15.9%; p=0.054. At Year 4 and Year 5 this difference was 
confirmed (42.9% for both: 53.6% vs. 10.7% [p=0.054] and 50.3% vs. 7.4% [p=0-107], respectively).

BRAIN MRI   
Late Infantile MLD (LI MLD)
Stabilisation of brain MRI total score was seen between Year 2 and Year 3 post-GT in all LI subjects except 
for two subjects (Patient 4 and 6), who stabilised later at Year 3 post-GT. The MRI score mean differences 
between Libmeldy treated LI subjects and NHx subject of -11.8 (p<0.001). (see Figure 16 for individual panel 
plots).

Listing 2.44
All LI subjects pre-symptomatic at the time of treatment (8/9) stabilised at a significantly lower MRI total 
score (≤4.25) than untreated NHx subjects at a comparable chronological age of 53 months, supporting a 
relevant treatment effect of Libmeldy-f on the typical brain involvement (demyelination and atrophy) 
observed in MLD.
The outcomes for nerve conduct velocity, parent reported outcomes and neuropsychological tests were 
consistent witht the GMFM findings.

Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD
Difference between the Libmeldy treated EJ MLD and NHx was -4.1 points, p=0.12, on brain MRI. For the 
pre-symptomatic EJ MLD, the differences in the adjusted LS mean MRI total scores between the Libmeldy 
treated pre-symptomatic EJ subjects and NHx subjects was 10.7 (95%CI 7.0, 14.4; p<0.001). For the 
Symptomatic EJ MLD, the difference in LS mean MRI total score between the Libmeldy treated symptomatic 
subjects and NHX was 5.8 (95% CI -4.0, 15.5; P=0.21).
SURVIVAL
Late Infantile MLD (LI MLD)
At the latest observation visit covered by this study report, the mean follow-up for all LI subjects treated is 
5.4 years (range 2.98 to 7.51 years) and all subjects remain alive (overall survival 100%). Because no 
deaths occurred in the LI subgroup treated with Libmeldy-f, no median survival time is available.
Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD
Two of the 11 (18%) subjects in the EJ subgroup treated with Libmeldy-f had died due to disease progression 
(parents elected not to continue full supportive care), and 3 of the 12 (21%) TIGET NHx Study participants 
had died at the time of the interim analysis. However, none of the pre-symptomatic EJ MLD patients treated 
died. Two of the 7 subjects in the symptomatic EJ MLD subgroup treated with Libmeldy-f died due to disease 
progression (parents elected not to continue full supportive care).
OTHER SECONDARY OUTCOMES
Late Infantile MLD (LI MLD)
The outcomes for the GMFM-MLD, nerve conduct velocity, neuropsychological test, parent reported outcome 
were consistent with the effects seen for the GMFM. 
Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD
For the overall EJ MLD population the outcomes for the GMFC-MLD, nerve conduct velocity, 
neuropsychological test, parent reported outcome were generally consistent with the effects seen in the 
GMFM. Pre-symptomatic EJ MLD subjects had scores for GMFC-MLD, nerve conduct velocity, 
neuropsychological test within ranges reported for healthy subjects. 
Symptomatic EJ MLD. Throughout the extended follow-up period, 6/8 Symptomatic EJ subjects remained 
stable and above the threshold for sever cognitive impairment (IQ≥55) with a statistically significant 
difference from the NHx controls at Year 2 (IQ 88.9 vs. 31.9 in NHx controls; treatment difference 61.1, 
p=0.029), Year 3 (89.4 vs. 17.6; treatment difference 71.8, p=0.013), Year 4 (81.9 vs. 15.2; treatment 
difference 66.8, p=0.026), but not at Year 5 (48.2 vs. 9.8) probably due to the small numbers.While 
deterioration is observed in all symptomatic EJ subjects on motor function, the cognitive function appears to 
be preserved in subjects with an IQ>85 and a GMFC-MLD ≤1. On both group and individual levels an effect 
on cognitive function is seen as the IQ is comparable or higher compared to healthy children of the same 
age.
Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID)
The applicant conducted an exploratory analysis to define the minimal clinical important difference. The 
minimal clinical important difference was defined by the applicant as the GMFM total score decrease causing a 
change in one GMFC-MLD level. The applicant plotted the GMFC-MLD against the GMFM total score. There is a 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 78/157
 
 
linear relationship between the decrease in the mean GMFM total score and the increase of GMFC-MLD levels 
and specific percentages of the GMFM total score correspond to specific levels of GMFC-MLD. A 15% change 
in GMFM corresponds to a 1 category change in GMFC-MLD level. The treatment effects of Libmeldy on GMFM 
(%) total scores in surviving early symptomatic EJ patients at Year 2, Year 3, Year 4 and Year 5 post-
treatment ranged between 28.7% and 42.9%, and therefore 2-3 times the MCID identified in the exploratory 
analysis. The results were consistent when only the 5 early symptomatic EJ subjects meeting the current 
proposed cut of points for treatment (IQ score ≥85 or GMFC-MLD<1) would have been included.  In more 
practical terms, while at the same chronological age untreated NHx controls had lost all locomotion function 
and head and trunk control indicated by a GMFC-MLD level of 6, the early symptomatic EJ subjects had 
maintained part of their motor function (two subjects, both at level 3) or even were able to walk 
independently for short distance (one subject).
QoL-related composite endpoint “Severe Motor Impairment Free Survival (sMFS)
The applicant reported results of analysis on the QoL-related composite endpoint “Severe Motor Impairment 
Free Survival (sMFS)” defined as the interval from birth to the earliest point of loss of locomotion and sitting 
without support (GMFC-MLD Level 5 or higher) or death. The individuated corresponding level of GMFC-MLD 
at which QoL is severely impacted was 5. A survival analysis on early symptomatic EJ variant showed that 
3/8 subjects (37.5%) experienced sever motor impairment (one subject) or died (two subjects) 
corresponding to a 62.5% estimated probability of remaining event-free (maintained locomotive and/or 
sitting abilities, GMFC ≤4) at a chronological age of 8 years compared with a 36.0% estimated probability for 
untreated EJ subjects. All but one of the surviving EJ subjects (5/6, 83%) treated at an early-symptomatic 
stage remained event-free throughout follow-up compared with none in the untreated EJ group (unstratified 
log-rank test for all treated early symptomatic EJ subjects vs. untreated subjects p=0.031). Even when the 
sMFS was evaluated as time to event from disease onset, the results were consistent and by 4 years post-
disease onset, an estimated 62.5% of treated early symptomatic EJ subjects survived and maintained 
locomotion and ability to sit without support compared with 26.3% of untreated EJ subjects. 
As of the new data cut of December 2010, no additional ES EJ patients died or met the criteria for severe 
motor impairment (GMFC ≥5). Five of 6 (83%) surviving ES EJ MLD patients have remained event-free 
throughout the extended follow-up compared with none in the untreated EJ group (unstratified log-rank test 
for all treated ES EJ subjects vs. untreated subjects for age at sMFS p=0.033, log rank for time from disease 
onset to sMFS p=0.063).

Results. Seven pre-symptomatic LI subjects and 2 pre-symptomatic EJ subjects were treated in EAP 
(expanded access programmes). All tested patients showed a high percentage of %LV+ cells (geometric 
mean: 92.71%, range: 85.7% to 98.4%; n=5), 28 days after treatment with Libmeldy-f. This engraftment 
was sustained 12 months post-treatment (geometric mean: 92.47%, range: 80.1% to 100.0%; n=5). 
At Year 1, a 64-fold increase (95% CI: 19-fold, 214-fold; n=8) in ARSA activity in PBMCs was observed 
compared with baseline levels (Table 14.2.2.2). The mean value at Year 1 (1830.1 nmol/mg/h) was 9.24-fold 
higher than the upper limit of the ARSA activity normal range (198.02 nmol/mg/h). At time points beyond 
Year 1, confidence intervals are currently large due to the limited number of patients contributing data; 
however, the data to date shows stabilisation at levels similar to the mean observed at Year 1 (Year 2, 
2164.2 nmol/mg/h, n=3; Year 2.5, 2199.1 nmol/mg/h, n=3).
Consistent with ARSA activity in PBMCs, mean ARSA activity levels in total BM mononuclear cells also 
increased substantially as early as 3 months after treatment. By 3 months after treatment with Libmeldy-f, 
mean ARSA activity levels in total BM MNC were 37.6-fold (95% CI: 24.22-fold, 58.40-fold; n=5) higher than 
baseline. Throughout the course of follow up, mean ARSA levels in total BM mononuclear cells remained at 
least 55-fold higher than baseline.

NOTE: Healthy children data were from Palisano and colleagues, who provided access to the anonymous age and

The results of the Brain MRI severity scores, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), Neuropsycholoical tests, Gross 
Motor Function Classification in MLD (GMFC-MLD), nine-hole peg test and lansky performance were consistent 
with the outcomes reported for the in total GMFM score.  
Survival. In studies HE 205029 and CUP 206258, 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%) enrolled in the EAPs were alive 
as of the data cut. One patient (Patient 27) died due to ischemic cerebral infarction, which is considered 
unrelated to Libmeldy-f (se Clinical AR section 4.4.2 deaths for narrative). 
Study 205756 is an open-label, single-arm study in pre-symptomatic LI MLD or EJ MLD subjects.
This study was performed with crypopreserved formulation and submitted in order to substantiate that the 
clinical efficacy between the fresh and cryopreserved formulation is similar. Based on the previous experience 
only pre-symptomatic subjects were included. 
Subjects treated with Libmeldy-c showed comparable levels of in the proportion of LV-Positive Colony-
Forming Cells in BM: At Month 1 post-treatment, all subjects tested (n=3) showed high levels of genetically 
modified cells in BM, with a range between 70.83% LV+ cells and 80.83% LV+ cells. At Month 3, data were 
available for two Subjects (Patient 31 and 32), showing 89.39% LV+ cells and 80% LV+ cells, respectively, 
consistent with the level observed at Month 1 for one Subject (Patient 32). Post-treatment, all subjects with 
available data had ARSA values within or above the normal range (normal range=30.56-198.02 nmol/mg/h) 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 84/157
 
 
at Month 1 and above the normal range at Month 2. Levels above the normal range were maintained at 
Month 3, Month 6, and Year 1 for the subjects with available data.
At Baseline, ARSA activity levels in CSF were undetectable in all 4 subjects. After administration of Libmeldy-
c, ARSA activity levels were detectable and within the normal range at Month 3 in all three subjects with 
available data (three Subjects- Patients 30,31,32).
 Preliminary data on GMFM total score showed that gross motor function for all 4 subjects was within the 
range of gross motor function observed in a healthy cohort of children from (Palisano, 1997) of similar 
chronological age (grey shade) (Figure 18).

Secondary outcomes were consistent with the findings from the main study. 
Extrapolation plan from LI MLD and EJ MLD to LJ MLD
The applicant originally proposed an extrapolation plan to include treatment of LJ MLD patients based on 
i) the positive benefit/risk profile shown in the source early-onset MLD population (particularly in 
symptomatic domains which are most relevant for late-onset MLD patients), 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 85/157
 
 
ii) the arbitrary age separation between the EJ and LJ variants, 
iii) the common disease pathophysiology across MLD variants, 
iv) the shared mechanism of action of Libmeldy to address the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of 
the disease, along with
v) the larger window of opportunity in late-onset MLD and 
vi) the post-approval clinical activities proposed to address the gaps in knowledge. 
Full extrapolation from LI MLD and EJ MLD to LJ MLD was not agreed. While the distinction between LI MLD 
/EJ MLD and LJ is arbitrary, the disease pathology is similar across these disease subtypes, and the 
mechanism of action of OLT-200 is similar across the disease subtypes it may be rational to extrapolate the 
efficacy of treatment as seen in the subjects with early onset of disease (LI MLD /EJ MLD) to the older 
paediatric population (LJ MLD). However, it should be noted that for subjects with LJ MLD the disease 
severity and the life expectancy is different compared with subjects with LI MLD and EJ MLD. The LJ-MLD 
variant is closer to the adult MLD than to the EJ and LI variant of the disease. As a consequence, the benefit 
and the risks of treatment should be weighed differently. Furthermore, LJ subjects are identified by 
symptoms and the symptomatic status of the patient is vital for the treatment success, data is required to 
conclude on prognostic values for treatment success in LJ MLD. 
Therefore, the applicant has now removed LJ MLD from the proposed indication. The applicant intents to 
submit data from an open label non-randomised study to extend the indication to LJ MLD subjects.
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
The applicant originally proposed the following indication:
“Treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) in patients from birth to before 17 years and in older 
patients for whom disease onset occurred before 17 years.
Treatment with Libmeldy should be performed before the disease enters its rapidly progressive phase.”  
MLD is a rare autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the ARSA 
gene that results in deficiency of its corresponding enzyme. The disease spectrum can present in different 
clinical forms, but there is no universally accepted classification system for MLD phenotypes and at least 3 
clinical forms of the disease are commonly described (late infantile [LI], juvenile, and adult MLD). The 
juvenile forms are further stratified into early (EJ) and late juvenile (LJ).
The clinical development programme supporting the requested indication is based on 2 clinical studies and 3 
Expanded Access Programmes (EAPs), with total of 33 patients (18 LI and 15 EJ; 24 pre-symptomatic and 9 
early-symptomatic). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies
In support of the claimed indication, treatment of MLD in patients before the age of 17 years, efficacy results 
have been submitted of 33 LI MLD and EJ MLD patients who were treated with Libmeldy in a total of 5 clinical 
studies with a similar design. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 86/157
 
 
The studies concerned non-randomised, open-label, prospective, comparative (natural history cohort 
control), single centre studies. Each study had a screening phase, baseline phase, treatment phase and 
follow-up phase. 
No specific dose-response studies were conducted, and the dose range to be used in clinical studies was 
based on experience with other autologous-ex-vivo gene therapy programmes, which is acceptable based on 
EMA Guidelines [EMA/CAT/GTWP/671639/2008 and EMA/CAT/GTWP/671639/2008/Rev. 1]. 
PD parameters, which consists of engraftment of LV transfected cells and ARSA activity levels were measured 
in all studies. 
Additional analyses seem to confirm that cell dose levels as DP quality attribute can have an impact on early 
cell engraftment and peripheral PD parameters (ARSA activity in PBMCs) but not on haematological 
reconstitution and clinical efficacy outcomes. Therefore, it was not possible to identify a clear cut-off of cell 
dose predicting efficacy in terms of motor and cognitive function. For this reason, the dose range 
recommendation proposed in section 4.2 on the SmPC that are based on the experience derived from the 
field of allogenic and autologous HSCT and the body of evidence on Libmeldy is acceptable.      
The design of the main study, e.g. single arm with natural history cohort, was agreed by the SAWP given the 
severity and progressive nature of the disease, the absence of curative treatment, the possibility of Libmeldy 
to be curative treatment and the limited size of the target population. Despite the well-known limitations 
related to the use of a NHx control group for registrational studies, even in rare diseases, it is acknowledged 
that the applicant’s efforts allowed to improve the matching strategies based on age and disease variant and, 
hence possibly by disease stage, by implementing both retrospective and prospective data collection, 
reducing the variability in operator assessment (i.e. the same staff administered tools/assessment to both 
NHx and treated subjects), and using the same methodology, instrumentation, and assessments. 
All subjects enrolled in the registrational Study 201222 and in the NHx cohort had an MLD diagnosis based on 
molecular, biochemical, and clinical parameters and pseudodeficiencies were excluded based on the presence 
of two disease-causing mutations and the presence of an affected sibling.
The use of a natural history cohort consisting of 31 untreated LI MLD and EJ MLD subjects as well as data 
from an untreated sibling with MLD to serve as a control was also agreed. MLD is very heterogeneous and the 
use of these comparators help to contextualise the results.  
The studies included pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic LI MLD and EJ MLD subjects. An extrapolation 
of the outcomes from the clinical studies in LI MLD and EJ MLD subjects to LJ MLD population was proposed 
based on the similarity in disease pathology and the mechanism of action of Libmeldy. 
All LI MLD and some pre-symptomatic EJ MLD subjects were identified after an older sibling developed 
symptoms and was diagnosed with MLD, prompting family testing.  LI MLD was defined as patients with an 
age at onset in the older sibling ≤30 months, and/or 2 null (0) mutant ARSA alleles, and/or peripheral 
neuropathy at electroneurographic study. EJ MLD was defined as age of onset in the subject or effected 
sibling between 30 months and 7th birthday, and/or 1 null (0) and 1 residual (R) mutant ARSA alleles, and/or 
peripheral neuropathy at electroneurographic. These correspond with the general distinction for the MLD 
variants.
Pre-symptomatic status was defined as subjects without disease related symptoms or with no abnormalities 
observed in the electroneurographic study and brain MRI. Early symptomatic status was only defined for the 
EJ-MLD population. This was initially within 6 months after the first reported symptom, and later as subjects 
with an intelligence quotient ≥70 and the ability to walk independently for ≥10 steps. The definition of early 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 87/157
 
 
symptomatic is not a general accepted term, but a criterion defined by the applicant. The change to include a 
threshold for walking and intelligence quotient can be agreed, as this takes into account the heterogeneity of 
the MLD and is independent of the progression rate. 
In addition to the definition of early symptomatic, the applicant introduced several changes to the clinical 
programme. These concern several modifications to the manufacturing process, switch in formulation from 
fresh to cryopreserved, the possibility to collect starting material from peripheral blood by apheresis instead 
of bone marrow puncture, and a change in the myeloablative condition regimen with busulfan. Patients 
received initially a SMAC regimen (4800 μg*h/L) which was subsequently modified to a MAC regimen (67,200 
µg*h/L) with the aim to reduce the variability of transduced cell engraftment. 
All studies had the same co-primary endpoints consisting of an improvement in the total GMFM score and an 
increase in ARSA activity in PBMCs, both assessed 2 years post treatment. The treatment was deemed a 
success when a delay in progression of 10% of the total GMFM score and a 2x standard deviation increase in 
ARSA activity levels was recorded. 
Secondary outcomes include brain MRI, Gross Motor Function Classification in MLD (GMFC-MLD), ARSA 
activity in CSF, neuropsychological tests, survival etc. Overall, the chosen primary and secondary endpoints 
allow assessment of neuronal development (GMFM, neuropsychological testing) and disease progression 
(brain MRI, NVC, GMFC-MLD, GMFM and neuropsychological testing). While the combination of an efficacy 
parameter (GMFM score) and a pharmacodynamic parameter (ARSA activity) at a certain point in time can be 
accepted as a primary endpoint, for a proper appreciation of the effect of treatment and given the limitations 
to the patient population the full data pack will need to be taken into account. Notably, there is an overlap in 
the different endpoints, e.g. GMFC-MLD and GMFM both assess motor function. As regard to ARSA activity, it 
is acknowledged that peripheral ARSA activity measured in PBMC better reflects the mechanism of action of 
Libmeldy as modified cells infused systematically that should subsequently migrate into the CNS and PNS 
after crossing the blood-brain barrier. For efficacy ARSA activity in CNS and PNS is needed and thus ARSA 
CSF levels are of specific interest. The applicant’s hypothesis that ARSA activity in CSF may represent only a 
downstream expression of enzymatic reconstitution in the brain could be biologically plausible, however, this 
has not been proven with specific studies. Therefore, although ARSA activity in CNS does not take into 
account the enzymatic activity in PNS, it should represent one of the direct markers of Libmeldy mechanism 
of action and efficacy at central level. Indeed, focus of the assessment will be on the ARSA activity in the 
CSF, the GMFM assessment (primary endpoint), brain MRI and neuropsychological testing as this allows 
assessment on molecular level, morphological level, motor development and cognitive function. 
The effect of the change in formulation of Libmeldy on the efficacy, i.e. Libmeldy-f vs Libmeldy-c, is assessed 
by the applicant in a separate clinical study. The data is compared to the pivotal study. This study includes 4 
subjects, 2 EJ MLD and 2 LI MLD. The follow up time ranged from 1 month to 1 year. This study also had a 
similar design as the pivotal study with the same Co-primary endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses
PK-PD analysis. Engraftment of bone marrow derived colonies harbouring the lentiviral genome was 
successful in all subjects. Levels increased within 28 days 59.1% and was 54.8% (CI 95% 44.1; 68.2%, 
[n=23]) at Year 1 post treatment. At Year 5, that proportion was 45.0% (CI95% 24.1%; 84.2% [n=6]). The 
VCN in the PBMCs increased to approximately 1 VCN/cell for the LI MLD and approximately 0.25 VCN/cell for 
the EJ MLD variant. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 88/157
 
 
VCN values in total PBMCs had a geometric mean of 0.19 copies/cell (range 0.03 to 0.68; n=29) at Day 28 
post gene therapy. In both the LI and EJ subgroups, the VCN in total PBMCs increased over time and 
remained relatively stable from Year 1 post-treatment throughout the course of follow-up.  The engraftment 
could be affected by the source material used. Originally data from 4 mobilised peripheral blood apheresis 
compared to 33 bone marrow derived batched were available. The applicant provided 6 additional batches 
from mobilised peripheral blood apheresis. Although some differences are observed in cell composition that 
can be attributed to the difference in starting material, there are no indications that this results in differences 
in clinical outcome. The VCN and ARSA activity in transduced cells was on average lower in mPB-derived 
batches. Results were, however, within the range observed for BM-derived batches.  
The applicant was requested in a Scientific Advice to link ARSA CSF levels to clinical outcome. Therefore, an 
analysis to determine whether a correlation between the ARSA CSF levels and GMFM, GMFC-MLD, DQ, MRI 
exist was performed. No correlation was found between ARSA CSF level and any of the clinical outcome 
measures examined (motor function, cognition or MRI total scores regardless the MLD variant and timepoints 
(2 Years and 3 Years post treatment).The applicant stated that CSF is a surrogate compartment of brain and 
hypothesised that levels of ARSA activity in CSF may represent a downstream expression of enzymatic 
reconstitution in the brain, reflecting the diffusion of a limited fraction of the supraphysiological enzymatic 
levels produced and secreted to the extracellular matrix for cross-correction. Furthermore, levels of enzyme 
activity reported might be influenced by the protein content in the CSF sample. These hypotheses will be 
further elucidated in a post marketing setting to allow evaluation of ARSA CSF activity as predicting factor for 
treatment success or explanation of failure, if possible. 
Pivotal study: 
The study included 9 LI subjects and 11 EJ subjects. The number of subjects included in the pivotal study is 
limited. All LI subjects were pre-symptomatic at time of screening. One subject (Patient 7) became 
symptomatic prior to treatment. In the EJ group, 4 subjects were pre-symptomatic and 7 subjects were early 
symptomatic at the screening phase. This did not change during the treatment phase. 
The follow up is 8 years, and at time of data cut off, the mean follow up was 5 years in the LI subjects and 3 
years in the EJ subjects. However, in accordance with the “guideline on safety and efficacy follow-up and risk 
management of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products” (EMEA/149995/2008 rev.1), the applicant has 
committed to follow up the subjects from the clinical programme up to 15 years in the planned post-
authorisation study.
Co-Primary endpoint
ARSA Activity
For the overall treated population, the mean ARSA activity increased in the total PBMCs, BM and CSF to levels 
above (for PBMCs and BM) or within the range (for CSF) observed in healthy subjects within 3 months. The 
fact that in some patients ARSA activity was higher than in healthy subjects does not raise a safety concern 
because in the absence of substrate the enzyme is presumed to be inactive and non-clinical data indicate that 
supra-physiological ARSA activity levels in the PBMC and BM do not pose a risk. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 89/157
 
 
At year 2 post treatment, the mean ARSA activity in the CSF was 0.85 nmol/mg/hr (95%CI 0.58; 1.25) for 
the LI MLD subjects and 0.64 nmol/mg/hr (95%CI 0.37; 1.13) for the EJ MLD subjects. 
In the individual profiles fluctuations and decrease of ARSA activity levels in the CSF can be noted. The 
fluctuations seen are unlikely due to assay variability as this was reported to be low with inter-run and intra-
run variability with a CV lower than 6%. It was hypothesised that fluctuations in protein content in CSF could 
theoretically drive fluctuations in reported ARSA activity in CSF and that the decrease observed in normalised 
ARSA activity in Late Infantile subjects at timepoints M60 and M96 might be driven by an increase in CSF 
protein. This could not be verified. For this a graph presenting CSF protein over time would have been 
helpful. As no new data on efficacy was submitted, it could also not be verified whether the decrease in ARSA 
activity led to a loss of efficacy. However, the applicant has committed to further investigate the relationship 
between CSF protein and ARSA activity to inform on maintenance of effect and loss of efficacy. 
Gross Motor Function Measurement
For the LI MLD 2 years post-treatment, mean total GMFM score in the Libmeldy treated LI MLD subjects was 
72.5 compared to 7.4 for the NHx subjects (Difference 65.1 points, 95%CI 41.6; 88.6), p<0.001).
The LI MLD group has one subject that was pre-symptomatic at screening and became symptomatic prior to 
treatment. This subject performed comparable to the NHx subjects, while the majority of the LI MLD showed 
performance within ranges observed for healthy subjects. 
The trajectory of the matched control patients in the pre-symptomatic phase is mainly extrapolated based on 
the age of the patient, which does not take into account the phenotypic variability that characterises LI 
patients. However, the high proportion of siblings (7/9 treated LI patients had their sibling in the NHx group) 
provides reassurance on the validity of the matching exercise.
It is noted that for 3 of the 9 treated LI MLD subjects, deterioration in GMFM score is observed, which 
appears to be associated with a drop of ARSA activity level in the CSF. This observation raises a concern on 
the durability of the treatment effect in these subjects. The applicant indicates that fluctuation in ARSA are 
driven by an increase in CSF protein and no new data was submitted. However, as no new efficacy data was 
submitted it could not be verified whether the decrease in ARSA activity led to a loss of efficacy. Therefore, 
further follow up data will be gathered in as a post marketing commitment in the planned post-authorisation 
study.
For the overall EJ MLD subjects the mean total GMFM score at 2 years after treatment was 76.5 for the 
Libmeldy treatment group compared to 36.6 points for the historical cohort (Difference 39.8 points 95%CI 
9.6; 80.1, p=0.026). However, due to the small number of subjects and high interpatient variability the 
comparison of mean values is not very informative. 
The pre-symptomatic EJ subjects had an adjusted mean GMFM total score of 96.7%, while for the NHx a 
mean GMFM total score of 44.3% was reported. The difference between the Libmeldy treated and NHx 
subjects was 52.4% (95%CI 25.1; 79.6, P=0.008) at Year 2. The individual panel plots show that 3 of the 4 
pre-symptomatic subjects performed in ranges of healthy subjects. One subject showed deterioration, which 
was accompanied by a decrease of ARSA activity in the CSF. 
For the symptomatic EJ subjects the adjusted LS mean GMFM total score was 60.7% at year 2 post 
treatment. The difference from the NHx group was 28.7% (95% CI -14.1; 71.5, p=0.35) at year 2. At Year 3 
there was a difference in treatment effect of 43.9% (59.8% vs. 15.9%; p=0.054). At Year 4 and Year 5 this 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 90/157
 
 
difference was confirmed (42.9% for both: 53.6% vs. 10.7% [p=0.054] and 50.3% vs. 7.4% [p=0-107], 
respectively). Although, on group level an effect is observed independent of symptomatic status, the 
individual profiles show predominantly deterioration on GMFM in the 8 symptomatic subjects. 
Summary data and clarifications provided by the applicant indicated that the number of missing values is 
relatively small, although, given the already small sample size related to the rarity of the condition, missing 
values further reduce the actual numbers which the main efficacy analyses were based on. Concerning the 
NHx controls, it is acknowledged that, given the characteristics of this cohort, it was expected that not all 
subjects would have contributed to all analyses. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, i.e. GMFM total score and ARSA activity, was assessed at a fixed time point 
of at 2 years post treatment. This is an observation at a single time point. With respect to the GMFM, the 
longitudinal evaluation is considered more appropriate, as this gives a better representation of the overall 
course of the efficacy in relation to the disease progression. For the majority of the LI-MLD the effect 
observed on the GMFM at 2 years is also reflected in the overall longitudinal pattern. In contrast, for all 
symptomatic EJ-MLD subjects a difference of 28.7% from the NHx is observed 2 years post treatment, while 
the individual panel plots showed deterioration. This deterioration was also observed in other outcomes, e.g. 
cognitive function, survival etc.  
In addition, the relevance of interpretation of these endpoints on group level is limited as effects are diluted 
due to wide interpatient variability in these endpoints as it is evident from the individual panel plots for the 
different clinical outcomes. Moreover, the individual profiles for the symptomatic subjects indicate disease 
progression. It is unknown if this group shows a lack of efficacy due to reaching the point of no return. 
Therefore, other outcomes should be taken into account too.
In conclusion, looking at the individual trajectories of the disease course, for the majority of pre-symptomatic 
LI- and EJ MLD patients, a clinically relevant treatment effect is observed at the time point of the primary 
endpoint (2 years) which is maintained at later time points. However, significant deterioration is observed on 
motor function for symptomatic EJ MLD patients. While data are suggestive that this deterioration may be 
less rapid than in untreated subjects, this is still uncertain as the wide variability in the disease trajectory 
prohibits a final conclusion on this issue. 
Note: treatment success was not discussed by the applicant, e.g. 2xSD ARSA activity and delay in 
progression of 10% GMFM. This issue is not pursued as the treatment effect is impressive, with pre-
symptomatic subjects performing consistently within ranges reported for healthy subjects not only for motor 
assessment, but also for cognitive function.
Secondary outcomes
Brain MRI
For the LI MLD subject the MRI outcome was consistent with the GMFM scores, i.e. the MRI score mean 
differences between Libmeldy treated LI subjects and NHx subject of -11.8 (p<0.001). Also, individual plots 
show stabilisation and no deterioration over time. 
For the EJ MLD on group level the difference between the Libmeldy treatment group and NHx was -4.1 point 
p=0.12 on brain MRI. For the pre-symptomatic EJ subjects, the differences in the adjusted LS mean MRI total 
scores between the Libmeldy treated pre-symptomatic EJ subjects and NHx subjects was 10.7 (95%CI 7.0, 
14.4; p<0.001). For the symptomatic EJ MLD patients, the difference in LS mean MRI total score between the 
Libmeldy treated symptomatic subjects and NHX was 5.8 (95% CI -4.0, 15.5; P=0.21). Individual plots in 
symptomatic and pre-symptomatic EJ subjects show stabilisation over time. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 91/157
 
 
The effects on morphology observed with the MRI do not correspond with the effects observed in the GMFM 
and other secondary outcomes. Therefore, the MRI on its own appears not to be an effective measure to 
determine efficacy of Libmeldy.
Cognitive performance
For the majority of the LI MLD subjects, the cognitive performance was within range reported for healthy 
subjects.
For the EJ MLD subjects, all 4 subjects who were treated prior to the onset of symptoms had 
neuropsychological composite scores that were largely within or above the normal range (score of 100 +/- 
SD of 15) at the time of the data cut-off, with the exception of the Processing Speed Index.
Throughout the extended follow-up period, 6/8 symptomatic EJ subjects who were early symptomatic, 
remained stable and above the threshold for severe cognitive impairment (IQ≥55) with a statistically 
significant difference from the NHx controls at Year 2 (IQ 88.9 vs. 31.9 in NHx controls; treatment difference 
61.1, p=0.029), Year 3 (89.4 vs. 17.6; treatment difference 71.8, p=0.013), Year 4 (81.9 vs. 15.2; 
treatment difference 66.8, p=0.026), but not at Year 5 (48.2 vs. 9.8). In 4/5 subjects that would have met 
the current proposed treatment criteria (i.e. IQ>85 and GMFC-MLD ≤ 1) had cognitive function in the normal 
range of healthy subjects. 
Survival
A borderline statistically significant difference was observed for overall survival of the LI MLD subjects as 
compared to the NHx cohort (unstratified Log-rank p-value 0.062) and for the EJ subjects (estimated HR 
1.85; log rank p-value= 0.537). In the EJ subgroup 2 deaths occurred, which were related to the disease 
progression. Both concern patients that were early symptomatic at start of treatment. 
The effect on survival is substantial, particularly in the pre-symptomatic patients. However, the quality of 
survival was not assessed by the applicant. This issue is not pursued as the pre-symptomatic subjects, show 
that the performance for both motor function and cognitive function is within the ranges of healthy subjects. 
Correlation analyses between clinical outcomes and engraftment and PD parameters
As requested, the applicant performed a correlation analysis between engraftment (%LV+ cells in BM, VCN in 
PBMCs) and PD (ARSA activity in PBMCs and CSF) parameters and clinical efficacy outcome measures at Year 
2 and Year 3 post-treatment. Statistically significant correlations were found between VCN and enzymatic 
activity in PBMCs at year 2 and Year 3 post-treatment. No correlation was found between engraftment 
parameters and ARSA activity in CSF; according to the applicant this could be due to the fact that ARSA 
activity in CSF could be an indirect marker of the enzyme secreted in the CNS and may underestimate the 
level of central enzymatic activity while the peripheral ARSA activity measured in PBMCs represents a more 
direct marker of the PD effects of Libmeldy treatment. Of note, conversely to what it could be expected, no 
statistically significant correlations were found between engraftment parameters and clinical outcome 
measures (i.e. GMFM at Year 2 and Year 3 timepoints post-treatment). This confirms that further studies are 
actually needed to better understand the etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of MLD, the multiple factors 
involved in the Libmeldy treatment response, and the crucial role of the baseline patient clinical status.
A discrepancy between the lower VCN in patients compared with VCN in DP was observed. The applicant 
specified that the starting material of Libmeldy is comprised of heterogeneous CD34+ cell populations, mainly 
composed of committed, short-lived progenitor cells. A small fraction of those cells are long-lived stem cells 
which have the ability to self-renew, engraft and give rise to long-term repopulating lineages. There may be 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 92/157
 
 
a random and uneven distribution of successful transduction with LV between short- and long-lived CD34+ 
cells during manufacturing of Libmeldy. The applicant hypothesized that the VCN in the long-lived stem cell 
population may be lower than in the bulk CD34+ population and this could account for the difference 
between DP VCN and VCN in patients. The requested analyses performed by the applicant suggest that 
colonies with high VCN in DP engraft and high VCN in DP does not influence cell viability, clonogenic 
potential, and time to haematological reconstitution. Furthermore, as requested, the applicant evaluated 
potential effect of high ARSA activity in DP on cell viability by conducting a correlation analysis between ARSA 
activity in DP and clonogenic potential as a marker of clinical engraftment. A significant inverse correlation 
was found (corr=-0.45, p=0.004), however, according to the applicant, this was likely driven by two DP 
batches with a lower VCN and lower ARSA activity which had a higher clonogenic potential compared to the 
other 26 batches.
Overall efficacy
Overall, the difference in GMFM scores observed in the pivotal is substantial and is considered extremely 
clinically relevant. This observation in GMFM scores is further supported by other secondary outcomes.  
However, a large variability in treatment effect is noted across subpopulations with maintenance of GMFM 
scores/stabilisation in disease course seen in some patients and rapid deterioration in others. 
The LI MLD subjects generally performed within ranges of healthy subjects for the different efficacy 
outcomes. For 3 of the 9 treated LI subjects, deterioration is observed, which coincide with a drop of ARSA 
activity levels. One LI-MLD subject became symptomatic just prior to treatment. This subject consistently 
shows deterioration in the different assessments.
For the EJ MLD population no clear relation between the ARSA activity levels in the CSF and clinical outcomes 
(e.g. GMFM, brain MRI, IQ) could be established. 
Three of the pre-symptomatic EJ MLD subjects consistently performed within ranges reported for healthy 
subjects. One subject had levels below the minimum ARSA activity levels reported in the CSF for healthy 
subjects. These subjects consistently show deterioration.  
All symptomatic patients irrespective of MLD variant (LI MLD (n=1), EJ MLD (n=3) showed deterioration 
across the motor function, cognitive function and parent reported outcomes. The degree of deterioration 
varied, which is consistent with the heterogeneity of MLD. In the early-symptomatic EJ-MLD subjects the 
cognitive function was maintained as subjects performed within or above ranges reported for healthy 
subjects. In light of the small study population studied and limited follow-up duration, a post-authorisation 
efficacy and safety study is required to evaluate the long-term efficacy of Libmeldy. It is considered 
necessary to obtain long-term follow up efficacy data to evaluate whether efficacy is maintained over time. 
Therefore, the study should also assess motor-functional development to track whether patients develop 
normally over time following Libmeldy treatment.  
Because of these differences in efficacy seen in the subpopulations in the study, the analysis of efficacy 
across subgroups is important for support of the proposed indication.
Efficacy across subgroups. 
Subgroup analyses were provided for disease subtype/variant (LI MLD/ EJ MLD), busulfan conditioning 
regimen (SMAC/MAC) and stage of the disease (Pre-symptomatic / symptomatic). 
Disease subvariant (LI MLD vs EJ MLD)
EMA/584450/2020
Page 93/157
 
 
Data from both the pivotal study (20 subjects, 9 LI MLD and 11 EJ MLD) and the full integrated efficacy set 
(33 subjects, 18 LI MLD and 15 EJ MLD) was presented for the LI MLD and EJ MLD population separately. The 
use of the full integrated set is agreed as treatment protocol was sufficiently similar and pooling of the data 
increases patient numbers. Further, as also indicated above, differences in disease progression that may 
impact the outcome as such analysis by subtype is endorsed. 
Both groups showed a similar profile of ARSA activity in the PBMC, BM MNC and CSF, e.g. an increase within 
28 Days to levels higher than reported for healthy subjects in the PBMC and BM MNC and with levels within 
the range reported for healthy subjects. However, the applicant acknowledged that from 6 months to Year 6 
post-treatment, efficacy results in terms of geometric mean of LV+ values cells in BM, VCN in BM-derived 
CD34+ cells and in PBMCs, ARSA activity in PBMCs were better with higher and, in some cases, relatively 
more stable values in the LI subgroup compared with the EJ subgroup. In any case, there is an overlap 
between the ranges reported for the LI subjects and the EJ subjects. Considering the mode of action and the 
same underlying pathophysiology, this is not unexpected. It is agreed with the applicant that, as the sample 
size at later timepoints was small, the results on the assessment of the long-term efficacy should be 
interpreted with caution.
The effect on GMFM, i.e. differences in score from the natural history cohort, was greater for the LI MLD 
population than for the EJ MLD population. However, differences on a group level appear to be driven by a 
difference in the symptomatic status of the subjects between the two populations. 
Concerning the long-term persistence of treatment effect, the reduction in the engraftment parameters (i.e. 
mean proportion of LV+ cells in BM over time) observed in both MLD variant subgroups did not have an 
impact on pharmacodynamic effect of Libmeldy treatment in terms of ARSA activity and apparently on clinical 
efficacy outcome measures. The applicant did not consider a second transplant as applicable and necessary 
because of i) the limited correlations between levels of engraftment and clinical outcomes, ii) the role of 
symptomatic status at the time of treatment that has a great impact on patient outcome after treatment, iii) 
the risk of insertional oncogenesis that after a second transplant is unknown and could increase, and finally 
iv) the benefit-risk profile of a second conditioning regimen such as that applied for Libmeldy treatment that 
is unknown. These argumentations for the need to administer Libmeldy once are reasonable and acceptable.   
Disease stage (pre-symptomatic vs Symptomatic)
In the PK/PD section above data by symptomatic status was also presented. In brief, there was no effect of 
symptomatic status on the engraftment of Lentiviral vector positive cells or ARSA levels achieved in the 
PBMC, BM MNC and CSF. However, the clinical outcomes show an effect of symptomatic status. 
In the LI MLD group all subjects were included pre-symptomatically, however, one subject became 
symptomatic prior to treatment. This subject consistently performed within ranges and close to the natural 
history cohort for all outcomes, while the pre-symptomatic LI MLD subjects performed within or close to the 
ranges of healthy subjects Indicating that for this symptomatic LI-MLD subject the window of opportunity to 
perceive treatment benefit on either motor function or cognitive function was missed. Therefore, treatment in 
LI-MLD should be initiated before subjects become symptomatic. 
Pre-symptomatic EJ MLD subjects (n=4) had an adjusted mean GMFM total score of 96.7%, while for the NHx 
a mean GMFM total score of 44.3% was reported. The difference between the Libmeldy treated and NHx 
subjects was 52.4% (95%CI 25.1; 79.6, P=0.008) at Year 2. The differences in the adjusted LS mean MRI 
total scores between the Libmeldy treated pre-symptomatic EJ subjects and NHx subjects was 10.7 (95%CI 
7.0,14.4; p<0.001). At the time of the data cut-off, with the exception of the Processing Speed Index, all 4 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 94/157
 
 
subjects who were treated prior to the onset of symptoms had neuropsychological composite scores that 
were largely within or above the normal range (score of 100 +/- SD of 15).
For the symptomatic EJ subjects the adjusted LS mean GMFM total score was 60.7% at year 2 post 
treatment. Difference from the NHx group was 28.7% (95% CI -14.1; 71.5, p=0.35) at year 2. The 
difference in LS mean MRI total score between the Libmeldy treated symptomatic subjects and NHX was 5.8 
(95% CI -4.0, 15.5; P=0.21). Four of the 7 subjects had total IQ above the severe mental disability threshold 
(IQ>55) at Year 2 and Year 3 post-GT. In 3 of the 4 subjects the test could not be performed. Data on 
cognitive function shows that treated early symptomatic EJ MLD subjects perform within ranges of healthy 
children. This indicates a window of opportunity for treatment as cognitive function remains intact over the 
period analysed.  
Data showed that, while pre-symptomatic patients have a better response to Libmeldy treatment compared 
with the symptomatic subjects (mainly early symptomatic EJ subjects in the case of the clinical development 
programme of Libmeldy), these last experienced a disease progression following treatment. For treated early 
symptomatic EJ subjects it appears that there is a delay in rate of motor function deterioration and that 
cognitive function is maintained, indicating a window of opportunity for symptomatic EJ MLD population. The 
applicant proposes that treatment should be initiated before in symptomatic MLD patients aged 30 months to 
7 years with an IQ score ≥85 or GMFC-MLD<1. This cut off point is accepted. If more follow up data becomes 
available these criteria may need to be adapted. Further identification of prognostic factors for response, i.e. 
target population, will be part of the post-authorisation study
In conclusion, efficacy in pre-symptomatic LI-MLD and EJ-MLD and early symptomatic EJ-MLD is 
demonstrated.
Conditioning regimen
Two different busulfan conditioning regimens were used (SMAC and MAC) and the effect of the conditioning 
regimen on transduced cell engraftment and ARSA activity are discussed in the Pharmacodynamics section.
Supportive studies. 
The effect observed in the expanded programme studies reflects the outcomes seen in the pivotal study. In 
the expanded excess programmes only pre-symptomatic patients were treated. 
One study focused on the effect of the fresh formulation (Libmeldy-f) compared to the commercial 
formulation (Libmeldy-c, cryopreserved). Although the clinical data is limited (n=4), no differences is 
observed in the short-term effect (e.g. 3 months-1year) on GMFM, ARSA CSF activity and other functional 
outcome measures.  The outcomes were consistent with the pivotal study. 
Proposed post-authorisation plan 
Limited data was provided by the applicant in terms of number of subjects and follow up time. Therefore, the 
applicant has committed to conduct a post authorisation efficacy and safety study LongTERM-MLD. The main 
goal of proposed study LongTERM-MLD is to increase the patient numbers and to provide long term follow up 
data (up to 15 years). The applicant proposes to enrol two groups of patients:
Group 1: all patients who are treated in a clinical programme of Libmeldy, i.e. patients who already received 
treatment will be followed up to 15 years and patients enrolled in a new clinical study. This group will 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 95/157
 
 
therefore also include subjects with LJ-MLD as a study in this population is open for recruitment. Group 2: all 
patients treated in a post marketing setting, i.e. LI MLD and EJ MLD subjects.  The applicant will include Off-
label treated subjects as a separate subgroup 2c. 
The CAT agreed that this study is needed to ensure long-term follow-up of efficacy and safety of Libmeldy 
treatment. In addition, the applicant should submit a full study protocol within 3 months after approval, thus 
a detailed assessment of the proposed study will be performed at a later stage.    
Extrapolation to full paediatric MLD variant. 
Based on the comments received regarding the full extrapolation from LI-MLD and EJ-MLD to LJ-MLD, the 
applicant has removed the LJ-MLD from the indication. Full extrapolation is not agreed as the disease 
progression of LJ-MLD is different to that from LI-MLD and EJ-MLD, and much closer to the adult-MLD. 
Therefore, the benefit/risk should be weighed differently. Moreover, LJ-MLD patients are currently identified 
when already symptomatic. As the symptomatic status impacts the efficacy, the prognostic parameters for 
treatment success in the LJ-MLD populations should be identified and substantiated. Therefore, the applicant 
intends to submit data from an open label non-randomized study to extend the indication to LJ-MLD subjects.

2.7.2.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy
Libmeldy shows impressive efficacy in the pre-symptomatic LI MLD and EJ MLD as physical and cognitive 
performance is within the normal range of healthy subjects for the vast majority of the pre-symptomatically 
treated subjects for the duration of FU. The median follow-up at time of submission (cut-off date March 2018) 
for the pivotal study was 5.4 years (range: 2.98 to 7.51 years) and 3.5 years (range: 0.64 to 6.55 years) for 
LI MLD (n=9) and EJ MLD (n=11), respectively. The effects of the treatment are evident on gross motor 
function, cognitive function, brain MRI, and survival. As there appears a reduction in cells with high VCN and 
the ARSA levels seems to decrease over time, it remains to be seen whether the effect of treatment is 
maintained or whether, in time, progression to symptomatic disease may occur. However, further data can 
be gathered post marketing to confirm efficacy as the current numbers are limited, and to reassure a 
maintenance of effect as the follow up will be 15 years.  
While deterioration on motor function is observed in all symptomatic EJ subjects, data indicate that for the 
early symptomatic patients there appears to be a delay in rate of motor function deterioration and the 
cognitive function is within or above the ranges of heathy subjects form the same age. Also, as there is 
currently no screening programme for MLD, the majority of subjects will be identified when they are 
symptomatic. The applicant aimed to identify the “cut-off” points beyond which the window of opportunity for 
treatment is lost for symptomatic EJ MLD patients. The proposed cut off point is accepted. If more follow up 
data becomes available, these criteria may need to be adapted. Further identification of prognostic factors for 
response, i.e. target population, should be part of the Post authorisation safety and efficacy study. 
The CAT considered the following measures necessary to ensure the follow-up of efficacy:
EMA/584450/2020
Page 96/157
 
 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Libmeldy in children with late infantile or 
early juvenile forms of MLD, the MAH will conduct and submit the results of a prospective study based on 
data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol.
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.8.  Clinical safety
Patient exposure
The safety of Libmeldy was evaluated in 2 studies and in the expanded access programmes. 
The safety populations have been defined by the applicant as follows:
•
Safety set (n= 29) for the integrated analysis. Includes patients from:
o

a single patient from the Compassionate Use Programme (CUP) (207394)
Hospital Exemption (HE) programme (205029 n=3 patients)
CUP (206258 n=5 patients)
•
All subjects set (n= 30) includes all enrolled subjects across all clinical studies.
Data are presented separately for 4 subjects treated with Libmeldy-c in the ongoing Study 205756.
The data cut-offs for safety are as follows: 30 March 2018 (registrational study 201222), 5 January 2018 / 5 
December 2018 / 5 December 2018 (expanded access programme) and 14 March 2019 (study 205756).
Study phases
AEs were prospectively reported in the Libmeldy clinical development programme. However, after data 
collection, AEs were retrospectively allocated to the following study phases to facilitate the evaluation of the 
short- and long-term safety of treatment with Libmeldy; AEs were summarized and presented according to 
the following time periods by the applicant, unless otherwise specified:
•
•
•
Pre-treatment phase: Defined as prior to the first day of the conditioning regimen. Includes 
Screening and Baseline.
Treatment phase: From the first day of the conditioning regimen to the date of GT infusion. As a 
conservative approach, events that occurred on the same day as the first day of the conditioning 
regimen were included in the treatment phase as were any events that occurred on the date of 
GT infusion itself (Day 1).
Follow-up phase: Comprises the whole post-GT period, and was divided into the following sub-
phases for evaluation of safety:
EMA/584450/2020
Page 97/157
 
 
o
o
o
o
Acute phase: the period up to 48 hours after the end of the GT infusion (i.e. Day 2 and Day 
3, inclusive).
3-month post-GT: from 48 hours after the end of GT infusion up to and including Day 100. 
Short-term phase: ≥ Day 101 and < Day 1098.
Long-term phase: ≥ Day 1098.
In any given phase, only those AEs that started during that phase are reported. The AEs that were reported 
in previous phase(s) and were ongoing at start of the subsequent phase(s) were not reported in subsequent 
phase(s).
Duration of exposure
At the time of initial submission, the Integrated Safety Set consisted of 29 subjects with a median duration of 
follow-up of 3.160 years (range 0.64 to 7.51 years) (Table 11). The median duration of follow-up was similar 
in the LI subgroup (3.035 years) and in the EJ subgroup (3.49 years). Two LI subjects had completed more 
than 7 years of follow-up.

Exposure busulfan conditioning
In the Integrated Safety Set, 13 subjects (45%) were treated with a SMAC regimen, defined as a target 
cumulative AUC of 67,200 μg*h/L (target range 58,800 to 78,400 μg*h/L). Sixteen subjects (55%) were 
administered the MAC regimen, defined as a target cumulative AUC of 85,000 μg*h/L (target range: 76,500 
to 93,500 μg*h/L). Please refer to section 3.3.1 for the exposure results of the busulfan conditioning.

Adverse reactions related to Libmeldy
Four subjects (14%) experienced adverse reactions related to Libmeldy. These events were reported as the 
preferred term ‘ARSA antibody test positive’ (4 subjects, 14%). 
Adverse reactions potentially attributable to myeloablative conditioning (busulfan)
The review process for the selection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) potentially attributable to 
myeloablative conditioning was conducted using the integrated data set and was developed to ensure 
consideration of many aspects of the data.
The specific process included several steps. First, the preferred terms were further reviewed and compared 
with the product characteristics of busulfan (Busilvex, SmPC; Busulfex, US Prescribing Information) and other 
gene therapies (Strimvelis, SmPC; Zynteglo, SmPC) where similar myeloablative conditioning regimens have 
been used. AEs were flagged at the preferred term level, and then an iterative process involving the 
principles above was applied to the preferred terms in each SOC. Collectively, 39 preferred terms were 
flagged as potentially attributable to myeloablative conditioning.
Second, for the flagged preferred terms, further review of subject-level data was performed, including an 
assessment of relevant medical history, co-morbidities, and other AEs.
Finally, there was a clinical evaluation, which included, as appropriate, consideration of similar preferred 
terms, biological plausibility, nature and timing of the events, the underlying disease, and incidence of the 
event in the pediatric population. After a comprehensive final assessment, 33 preferred terms from 14 SOCs 
were determined by the sponsor to be potentially attributable to myeloablative conditioning (Table 14).

Adverse reactions potentially attributable to MLD
Symptoms of MLD (not pre-defined) were reported only if clinically significant and NCI CTC Grade ≥3. AEs 
were manually reviewed by the sponsor and confirmed by the investigators after database lock to identify 
AEs typically associated with symptoms of MLD (e.g. ataxia, motor impairment, muscle spasticity, 
dysphagia). The decision to classify an event as associated with MLD was based on clinical judgement and 
experience with MLD.
During the Follow-up post-GT phase, in addition to the events of renal tubular acidosis and metabolic 
acidosis, events associated with MLD included gait disturbance (15 subjects, 52%), motor dysfunction (9 
subjects, 31%), muscle spasticity (9 subjects, 31%), aphasia (6 subjects 21%), ataxia (5 subjects, 17%), 
dysarthria (5 subjects, 17%), cognitive disorder (4 subjects, 14%), dysphagia (4 subjects, 14%), and seizure 
(2 subjects, 7%). 
In Study 205756, there was only one AE classified as associated with MLD, which was gait disturbance in one 
subject (Patient 30) at Month 6 (age 18.7 months) and Month 9 (age 22.1 months) due to a delay in 
independent walking.

In Study 205756, 4 subjects (100%) experienced a total of 19 Grade 3 AEs. During the Treatment phase, 1 
subject (Patient 32) experienced a Grade 3 AE of hypertransaminasemia. During the 3-month post-treatment 
phase, all 4 subjects (100%) experienced Grade 3 AEs. Febrile neutropenia (4 subjects, 5 events), 
neutropenia (3 subjects, 3 events), and stomatitis (3 subjects, 3 events) were the only AEs that occurred in 
>1 subject. One subject (Patient 30) experienced Grade 3 AEs of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia. One 
subject (Patient 31) had Grade 3 AEs of stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenia, and an SAE of 
Grade 3 sepsis. One subject (Patient 32) had Grade 3 AEs of stomatitis, febrile neutropenia (x2), and 
neutropenia. One subject (Patient 33), who only had follow-up data until Month 1, had Grade 3 AEs of febrile 
neutropenia, stomatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Two subjects had follow-up data in the Short-term phase. Of 
those subjects, only one subject (Patient 30), who had follow-up data to Year 1, had a Grade 3 AE of gait 
disturbance. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 AEs were reported during any of the study phases in Study 205756.
Serious adverse events
In Study 205756, a total of 4 SAEs were reported in two subjects. One SAE was reported after treatment with 
Libmeldy-c, an event of sepsis that occurred within the 3-month post-treatment phase. Three of the SAEs 
occurred in the Pre-treatment phase (device-related infection n=2, respiratory distress n=1). None of the 
SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to Libmeldy-c.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 108/157
 
 
Deaths
To date, three deaths have been reported in subjects treated with Libmeldy during the clinical development 
programme (two subjects -Patient 19 and Patient20- in Study 201222; one subject -Patient 27- in Study 
206258), all deemed to be unrelated to Libmeldy-f.
Two of these deaths were attributed to rapid progression of the underlying disease; in both cases the 
subjects were reported to be early symptomatic at the time of GT. One death was due to left hemisphere 
cerebral ischemic stroke, deemed unrelated to Libmeldy-f. All three events are further described below.
Two subjects (Patient 19,20) died during the registrational study as a result of events associated with rapid 
disease progression (dysphagia) approximately 15 and 8 months, respectively, after receiving treatment. 
One subject (Patient 19) was diagnosed with EJ MLD at 5 years of age and was treated at an early 
symptomatic stage. Post-GT, motor and cognitive function continued to deteriorate. By 5 months post-GT, 
the subject’s motor function was limited with the ability to stand with support and crawl a few meters, with 
an estimated Gross Motor Function Classification in MLD level 2 to 3. Difficulty in swallowing was first noted 
at 6 months post-GT, and motor dysfunction was reported as serious by 9 months post-GT. At approximately 
14 months after treatment, the subject experienced worsening spasticity (NCI CTCAE Grade 4) and 
dysphagia (NCI CTCAE Grade 5). The parents declined placement of a PEG feeding tube. The subject died 
approximately 15 months after receiving treatment. The investigator considered the death to be due to 
disease progression.
The other subject (Patient 20) was diagnosed with EJ MLD at 5 years of age and treated at an early 
symptomatic stage. Post-GT, progressive difficulties in walking and slightly slower speech were observed. At 
5 months post-GT, the subject continued to experience progression of disease, losing the ability to walk and 
speak followed by loss of hand, trunk, and head control. SAEs of spasticity and motor impairment were 
reported at approximately 5 months following treatment; events of motor impairment, spasticity, and 
dysphagia were reported as serious. The outcome of dysphagia was reported as fatal due to the inability to 
feed; the parents declined placement of a PEG feeding tube. Approximately 8 months after receiving 
treatment, the subject died. The investigator considered the events of motor dysfunction, muscle spasticity, 
and dysphagia as unrelated to Libmeldy-f and the death to be associated with disease progression.
One patient in the CUP programme (Patient 27) died after treatment with Libmeldy on Day 415 (13.8 
months). The patient was presymptomatic (EJ variant) at the time of treatment and remained asymptomatic 
at the time of experiencing an ischemic cerebral infarction (left hemisphere cerebral ischemic stroke) on Day 
414 that led to death (Grade 5) on Day 415. Routine follow-up for the patient performed at the Year 1 study 
visit prior to the SAE of ischemic cerebral infarction, showed that the patient was clinically well. The patient 
had no known predisposing risk factors for a thrombotic event, no vascular/endothelial complications after 
treatment, and no known history of trauma in the days leading up to the event. The cause of the event was 
unknown, but the investigator assessed the event of ischemic cerebral infarction as not related to Libmeldy, 
stating there was not sufficient information to establish a causal relationship between the event and gene 
therapy. The family declined post-mortem examination. The site continued to investigate the event in depth 
to define the exact nature, cause and pathophysiology of this acute event. The integration site analyses 
performed up to the latest follow-up by SR-TIGET showed highly polyclonal vector integration and did not 
reveal signs of clonal expansion or clonal dominance.

Adverse events of special interest
The applicant marks the following adverse events as significant and discusses them in more in detail: renal 
tubular acidosis / metabolic acidosis, hepatobiliary disorders, elevations in IgE and elevations in Ferritins. 
Therefore, these adverse events are grouped together by the assessors as “adverse events of special 
interest” and are discussed below.
Renal tubular acidosis/metabolic acidosis
It has been suggested that patients with MLD may develop an underlying proximal (Type 2) renal tubular 
acidosis due to sulfatide accumulation in the renal tubules. These patients may be at risk of metabolic 
acidosis in various acute clinical conditions such as infection.
Events of renal tubular acidosis and metabolic acidosis were defined based on venous blood gas parameters 
(blood pH and venous bicarbonate), urinary pH, and whether the acidotic event had occurred in combination 
with another clinical procedure (e.g., conditioning or general anaesthesia) or an acute clinical condition such 
an infection.
In the Integrated Safety Set, renal tubular acidosis or metabolic acidosis was reported prior to treatment with 
Libmeldy in 16 subjects (55%). In total (including before and after treatment with OTL-200-f), 19 subjects 
(66%) have presented with events of renal tubular acidosis or metabolic acidosis.
Renal tubular acidosis was reported in 8 subjects in the Pre-treatment phase, 4 subjects during the 
Treatment phase, and 2 subjects in the 3-month post-GT phase. The events occurring post-GT were 
considered to be related to the underlying disease and not to OTL-200-f.
Metabolic acidosis was reported in 3 subjects in the Pre-treatment phase, 4 subjects during the Treatment 
phase, 2 subjects in the 3-month post-GT phase, 1 subject in the Short-term phase, and 1 subject in the 
Long-term phase. The events occurring post-GT were considered to be related to the underlying disease and 
acute clinical condition at the time of the event.
Two subjects who experienced AEs of renal tubular acidosis prior to the treatment subsequently experienced 
SAEs of metabolic acidosis. In one of these cases, the SAE of metabolic acidosis was temporally associated 
with concurrent febrile neutropenia and mucositis. In the other case, the event of metabolic acidosis was 
reported with a concurrent event of upper airways infection. Both events resolved following treatment of the 
event and concurrent medical condition and were considered related to the underlying disease.
There were no significant findings indicating that the treatment or concomitant medications employed in gene 
therapy play a critical role in the exacerbation of renal impairments.
Hepatobiliary Disorders
Patients with MLD are known to be at increased risk of developing gallbladder abnormalities, including wall 
thickening and polyps, compared with patients with other lysosomal storage disorders or healthy patients. 
The deposition of accumulated sulfatide in visceral tissue has been implicated in these findings; the risk of 
gallbladder polyps evolving into carcinoma has been reported in MLD patients (Agarwal, 2013, Kim, 2017).
In the Integrated Safety Set, mild, non-serious gallbladder enlargement was reported in 22 subjects during 
the Pre-treatment phase. None of the subjects treated with Libmeldy presented with hepatic impairment prior 
to treatment.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 110/157
 
 
During the Follow-up phase, 16 subjects experienced hepatobiliary AEs that included newly reported events 
of gallbladder enlargement (3 subjects); gallbladder polyps were reported in 4 subjects with pre-existing 
events of gallbladder enlargement. In 2 subjects, a cholecystectomy was performed due to findings of polyps 
>5 mm identified by ultrasound scan. Cholecystectomies were performed in consideration of the reported risk 
of gallbladder polyps evolving into carcinoma. In both cases, the polyps were reported as SAEs.
After excluding event terms related to the gallbladder, 11 subjects (38%) in the Integrated Safety Set had 
events in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC. These events included veno-occlusive liver disease, drug-induced 
liver injury, hepatomegaly, and hypertransaminasemia. Specifically, 3 patients in the CUP/HE programmes 
experienced veno-occlusive liver disease. Two subjects experienced hypertransaminasemia (one Grade 1 and 
one Grade 2). Two subjects also experienced gallbladder enlargement and acute cholecystitis, n=1 each.
It is also important to highlight that hepatic veno-occlusive disease and hepatomegaly are known safety 
concerns related to busulfan conditioning (Ciurea, 2009) and reported as ‘very common’ adverse reactions in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC of the product which also reports that “Grade 3 elevated transaminases were 
reported in 24% of patients” (Busilvex Summary of Product Characteristics, 2017).
Elevations in Ig E
Increases in Ig E are typically associated with inflammatory responses. In the Integrated Safety Set, 
increased Ig E was reported in 4 subjects (14%) before treatment with OTL-200-f and in 13 subjects (45%) 
during the Follow-up post-GT phase. None of the AEs were serious, and the investigator assessed the events 
as unrelated to Libmeldy-f.
In Study 205756, 2 subjects experienced increased Ig E AEs; both events occurred prior to treatment with 
Libmeldy-c.
Elevations in Ferritin
Ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased secondary to several reasons, including inflammation, 
infection, or recent blood transfusion.
In the Integrated Safety Set, 6 subjects (21%) had AEs of serum ferritin increased; all were reported in the 
3-month post-GT phase. The events were likely related to repeated transfusions during this time period. 
None of the AEs were serious, and the investigator assessed the events as unrelated to Libmeldy-f.
In Study 205756 of Libmeldy-c, there were no AEs of increased ferritin reported.
Laboratory findings
Haematology
Two subjects had a high ANC prior to treatment with Libmeldy (Figure 19) and all subjects in the Integrated 
Safety Set experienced severe neutropenia (ANC <500/mcL). All subjects, except 2, experienced absolute 
aplasia (ANC=0) following busulfan conditioning. ANC recovered over time (Figure 19), and no subject had an 
ANC <500/mcL at Day 60. The geometric mean (95% CI) number of days with an ANC of 0 was 4.6 days 
(n=27, 1.81 days, 11.50 days) and with an ANC <500 mcL was 27.6 days (25.06 days, 30.36 days).

(Integrated Safety Set)
Note: Because the cumulative area under the curve in 2 subjects who received a sub-myeloablative conditioning regimen 
was outside the target range, data were analysed by total area under the curve rather than by conditioning regimen.
Source: 
Five subjects from the Integrated safety set received G-CSF after conditioning and the timing in relation to 
gene therapy is outlined in Table 17. Three of the five subjects received the MAC conditioning regimen and 
two received the SMAC conditioning regimen. Four subjects treated under Study 201222 and EAPs (Patient 
11,9,21,25) received G-CSF due to prolonged neutropenia (defined as neutropenia beyond Day +45 post-
treatment) in absence of any concomitant acute illness/infection. None of those patients met the per-protocol 
criteria for engraftment failure. Two out of the five subjects required a single dose of G-CSF. One subject 
(Patient 21) experienced a nonserious AE of Grade 3 febrile neutropenia at Day +25, which was treated with 
support from G-CSF once a day from Day +25 to Day +41. On Day +44, G-CSF was restarted in response to 
a neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/L and administered as required to keep the neutrophils counts above 500/mmc 
until Day +52. On Day +118, the patient received a single dose of G-CSF due to transient neutropenia 
(ANC=560/mmc).

Haematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets followed a similar pattern with an initial decrease after 
busulfan condition followed by a recovery to pre-treatment levels by Day 60.
The median number of days to platelet engraftment was 41 (range: 14 to 109 days) with Libmeldy 
treatment. All patients treated with Libmeldy received transfusion support with platelets and these infusions 
were considered part of the standard of care/prophylaxis for these subjects. In addition, platelet transfusions 
were given also for the treatment of adverse events (1 event of thrombocytopenia, 1 event of febrile 
neutropenia, and 3 events of epistaxis (in 2 patients)). There was one patient who experienced 
thrombocytopenia leading to clinical sequelae. This event was seen in one subject during the 3-months post-
GT phase in a complex post-transplant course, with SAEs of thrombocytopenia (Day 10), prolonged anaemia 
(Day 15), VOD (Day 19) and transplant-associated microangiopathy (TA-TMA) captured as atypical 
haemolytic uremic syndrome (Day 41). All the patients in the integrated safety set received transfusion 
support. Most of these transfusions were received during the peri-transplant period and mainly within the 
three months post gene therapy (≤100 days). One patient had a blood transfusion after 100 days post-GT 
(Day 382) after a decrease in haemoglobin concurrent to aspiration pneumonia. None of the 29 subjects in 
the integrated safety set received erythropoietin.
Nearly all subjects experienced low neutrophils and low platelets of potential clinical importance during 
follow-up (100% and 93%, respectively) (Table 18). No subjects experienced low hemoglobin, leukocytes, 
or lymphocytes of potential clinical importance after Day 60 or low platelets of potential clinical importance 
after Month 3. Subjects received routine standard of care procedures during treatment and hospitalisation, 
which includes transfusions to prevent severe anemia.

In Study 205756 of Libmeldy-c, transient haematological (e.g. neutrophils, erythrocytes, and platelets) 
decreases were observed after the conditioning phase in all subjects. After busulfan conditioning, all subjects 
experienced severe neutropenia (ANC <500/μL). None of the subjects had an ANC <500/μL at Day 60. The 
number of days with an ANC <500/μL ranged from 36-41 days, and the number of days with an ANC of 0 
EMA/584450/2020

ranged from 15-29 days. The number of days with an ANC <500/μL was in mean 39.2, ranged from 36-41 
days, and the number of days with an ANC of 0 ranged from 15-29 days (in mean 20.7 days).
Chemistry
In the Integrated Safety Set, most clinical chemistry values remained within the normal laboratory ranges 
(Table 2.7.4.3.16). Few subjects experienced changes in chemistry values of potential clinical importance, 
and these events all resolved in a short period of time (Table 2.7.4.3.17).
ALT and AST increased after conditioning and then gradually returned to the normal range (Figure 20 and 
Figure 21). Alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and Gamma Glutamyl Transferase levels generally stayed within 
the normal range (Figure 2.7.4.3.18).

For one patient (Patient 18) increases in ALT and AST levels to grade 3 were reported at Day -3 with a mild 
increase in GGT. Thereafter the levels decreased. Abdominal echo-scans were normal and the increase in 
liver enzymes was considered probably related by the investigator to conditioning with a possible contribution 
of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone. During the three months post-GT phase, ALT and AST levels 
remained high, with both ongoing as grade 3 AEs. On Day 4, a new peak was noted and again abdominal 
echo-scans were normal. The liver enzyme increases were considered to be a continuation of the previous 
events. At Day 14 again high ALT and AST values were reported with elevations in bilirubin and GGT at Day 
15. At that point, Hy's Law criteria were met. To exclude hepatic veno-occlusive disease, an echo-scan of the 
abdomen was performed and showed a mild peritoneal liquid accumulation without any evidence of alteration 
of blood flux at the sovra-hepatic veins. The investigator stated that the increased levels of bilirubin could 
also be subsequent to haemolysis related to a blood transfusion performed the previous day. Oral treatment 
with ursodeoxycholic acid for prophylaxis started on Day 15 and stopped on Day 17 because of rapid 
decrease of liver damage indexes and bilirubin. Hy’s law criteria were no longer met and the liver enzymes 
progressively decreased. This was deemed a possible late effect of the conditioning by the investigator and 
according to the applicant, the contribution of amphotericin B cannot be excluded. The increase in GGT 
resolved on Day 60, increase in ALT on Day 186, and increase in AST on Day 277. The investigator 
highlighted the relevance of multiple antibiotic therapy given for the febrile neutropenia and device related 
infection events and stated that the subsequent increases in liver enzymes may have resulted from an initial 
liver insult provoked by busulfan conditioning being possibly exacerbated by the concomitant infectious 
complications which have required administration of multiple drugs. For another patient Patient 13), ALT 
increased (grade 1) and AST increased (grade 1) were reported from Day 39 to Day 75, for which no action 
was taken. No additional testing or specific radiological investigation was deemed necessary by the 
investigator to further characterise these transaminase increases. Both AEs resolved approximately 1 month 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 116/157
 
 
later, with no corrective treatment and the subject did not experience any additional events of increased 
ALT/AST in the subsequent phases. The investigator stated that the concomitant medications (including 
amphotericin B and fluconazole), the recent occurrence of febrile neutropenia and busulfan conditioning could 
have all have played a role in the development of liver injury. In Study 205756, there have been no 
laboratory parameters reported to be of severity NCI CTC Grade ≥3 during the 3-month post-treatment 
phase.
Coagulation
Outside the normal range were reported for activated PTT (above the ref. range in 10/28 pts [36%]), for D-
dimer (above the ref. range in 17/28 pts [61%]), and Antithrombin III decreased in one patient after 3 
months of Libmeldy-c.
Pituitary-thyroid axis and Glucose
Thyrotropine (TRH) was reported > ref. range high in 9/28 patients (32%), increased in 3 LI at baseline; 
thyroxine free (FT4) was > ref. range high in 2/8 patients analysed and triiodothyroxine free (FT3) was > ref 
range high in 10/28 patients (36%).
Protein electrophoresis
In the Integrated Safety Set, the applicant concludes that most protein electrophoresis values remained 
within the normal laboratory ranges over time. No notable changes in protein electrophoresis were observed 
during the study.
Replication competent lentivirus
There were no confirmed positive results for RCL.
Malignancies and abnormal clonal proliferation
No malignancies were reported after treatment with OTL-200-f or OTL-200-c. 
Evidence of abnormal haematopoietic clonal proliferation was assessed by clinical and laboratory surveillance 
and BM examination. There was no evidence of clonal expansion as assessed by BM and PB lymphocytes 
karyotype, morphological analyses in the BM, immune phenotyping, and T cell receptor repertoire.
Vital signs
In the Integrated Safety Set, the applicant concludes that the vital signs were generally within age-
appropriate normal ranges. Changes in vital signs were mostly considered not clinically relevant. No 
significant changes were observed in the vital signs after treatment with Libmeldy-f. In Study 205756 of 
Libmeldy-c, some vital sign values were reported as transiently out of range according to the applicant.
Safety in special populations
Adverse events by MLD variant
AEs were analysed by MLD early-onset variant, either LI or EJ. MLD variant was determined per study 
protocol but generally took into account the age at onset of symptoms or age at onset of symptoms of the 
index case in the family, genotype, and the presence of documented peripheral neuropathy at 
electroneurogram recordings.
EMA/584450/2020
Page 117/157
 
 
Numerical differences were observed between the AEs in subjects with LI MLD and those with EJ MLD (see 
Table 19. A higher percentage of subjects with EJ MLD (85%) than subjects with LI MLD (38%) experienced 
AEs during the Treatment phase. Subjects with LI MLD experienced fewer SAEs during the Follow-up phase 
compared with subjects with EJ MLD (63% vs 77%).
Table 19 Adverse Events by MLD variant
Adverse events by symptomatic status at time of treatment

AEs were analysed by symptomatic status, and the population was broadly divided into subjects who were 
pre-symptomatic and subjects who were symptomatic at the time of treatment. Pre-symptomatic status was 
defined per study protocol.
Subjects who were symptomatic at the time of GT experienced more AEs during all study phases (see Table 
20).

Adverse events by busulfan conditioning regimen
The percentages of subjects who experienced an adverse event within the first three months (≤100 days) 
following treatment (treatment, acute, 3-months post-GT phases) for the SMAC and MAC groups are shown 
in Table 22.
Table 22. Incidence of Adverse Events by Busulfan Regimen within three months (≤100 days) 
post-GT (Integrated Safety Set)
Febrile neutropenia and stomatitis were more common in subjects who received a MAC regimen than in 
subjects who received a SMAC regimen (94% versus 62% and 63% versus 15%, respectively) (Table 22). 
Subjects were also more likely to have AEs of serum ferritin increased in the MAC group than in the SMAC 
group (38% versus 0%, respectively), which could be related to the need for transfusions after MAC. VOD 
occurred in 2 subjects (13%) who received a MAC regimen and 1 subject (8%) who received a SMAC 
regimen; aHUS occurred in 2 subjects (13%) who received a MAC regimen and did not occur in subjects who 
received a SMAC regimen (Table 2.7.4.2.1.36).
A small difference was observed between conditioning groups in the number of days with an ANC below 
500/μL (26.9 days [95% CI 23.79-30.35 days] SMAC and 28.2 days [95% CI 24.12-32.92 days] MAC). There 
was also a small difference between conditioning groups in the number of days with an ANC of 0/μL (3.9 days 
[95% CI 0.82-18.20 days] SMAC and 5.2 days [95% CI 1.46-18.66 days] MAC). During the Treatment 
phase, metabolic acidosis was only reported in subjects treated with a MAC regimen. Additionally, during the 
3 months post-treatment phase, metabolic acidosis was only reported in subjects who had received a SMAC 
regimen. At any time, hepatomegaly was reported in 4 out of 13 subjects receiving a SMAC regimen and 2 
out of 16 subjects receiving a MAC regimen.

Differences in common AEs between groups based on total busulfan AUC generally followed the same pattern 
as differences based on conditioning regimen. As would be expected based on the safety profile of busulfan, 
stomatitis was more common in subjects with a total busulfan AUC >76500 μg*h/L than in subjects with a 
total busulfan AUC ≤76500 μg*h/L.(56% versus 18%, respectively) (Table 23). Subjects were also more 
likely to have AEs of serum ferritin increased with a total busulfan AUC >76500 μg*h/L than with a total 
EMA/584450/2020

busulfan AUC ≤76500 μg*h/L (33% versus 0%, respectively). Otherwise, there were no meaningful 
differences noted in common AEs between conditioning groups based on total busulfan AUC.
A small difference was observed between conditioning groups by total busulfan AUC in the number of days 
with an ANC below 500/μL (26.0 days [95% CI 22.78-29.63 days] total busulfan AUC ≤76500 μg*h/L and

Pregnancy & Lactation
The effect on breast-fed infants of administration of Libmeldy to their mothers has not been studied. The 
excretion of Libmeldy in milk has not been studied in humans or animals.
Age at the time of treatment for subjects in the Libmeldy programme ranged from 7 months to 11 years. 
There were no pregnancies reported.
Immunological events
AAA were detected in four of 29 subjects treated with the fresh formulation of Libmeldy.
Antibody titres in all 4 subjects were generally low and at the time of the data cut, all had resolved to 
negative test results, either spontaneously (n=1) or after 1 cycle of rituximab (n=3). In two cases (Patient 
25 and 28), gait disturbance developed after the detection of AAAs. 
For Study 201222 (where AAA were tested from 3 months post-treatment onwards), no subjects have tested 
positive for AAA and none of the treated subjects under EAPs tested positive for antibodies at the baseline 
visit.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
No formal drug-drug interaction studies were performed.
Discontinuation due to AES
Three subjects discontinued the study early due to a SAE of death.

2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
The applicant discussed the safety based on the integrated safety set. This set consisted of 20 subjects from 
the registrational study 201222 and 9 subjects from the expanded access programmes. The number of 
patients in the Libmeldy safety set is therefore limited. The known safety profile of autologous HSCT and 
busulfan conditioning will however support in the interpretation of the safety profile of Libmeldy treatment. 
Safety data from the ongoing study 205756 with the cryopreserved formulation was presented separately. 
The median duration of follow up for the original MAA data cut is approximately 3 years, ranging from 1 to 7 
years. For study 205756 with the cryopreserved formulation the follow up was 30 days, 3 months, 6 months 
and 1 year respectively. For the integrated safety set, the data cut-off was mid-to-end of year 2018. 
Additional safety data was provided by the applicant, with the new cut-off at end of 2019 for Study 20122 
and March 2020 for the expanded access programme. In the updated safety data set (n=29) the median 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 124/157
 
 
duration of follow up was 4.5 years, ranging from 0.6 to 9 years. The new data cut for the cryopreserved 
study was end of 2019. Two additional subjects received Libmeldy-c as of the new data cut. The mean follow-
up for study 205756 (n=6) is 0.7 range, range 0 to 1.5 years. Overall, the data of the updated safety data 
set appears to be similar to what was observed in the original MAA data cut.
For gene therapies with genome editing properties, the safety follow-up should be 15 years. To address this 
issue, the applicant intends to perform a post authorisation study called LongTERM-MLD. In this study, 
patients will be included from the clinical development programme as well as new patients treated with the 
commercial formulation in accordance with an agreed protocol. 
As first part of Libmeldy treatment, patients will undergo BM harvest or mobilised PB apheresis and the safety 
profile of these procedures is described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. There are uncertainties regarding the cell 
collection procedures for Libmeldy treatment. The recommended amount of harvested BM in young children is 
no more than 20 ml/kg (Transfusion and apheresis Science 2018, 57, 323-330, Blood 2012, 119, 2935-
2942). According to the clinical trial protocol the BM volume collected was set at 20 to 25 mL/kg of donor 
weight. However, the amount of collected BM was adjusted for each subject in order to ensure that the 
desired target was reached. The median was 36.20 mL/kg (range: 17.64 to 56.60) in the pivotal trial with 
fresh formulation. The applicant acknowledges that the standard volume aimed for collection of a bone 
marrow sample in the allogeneic setting is ≤ 20 ml/kg. Taking into account the possible cell loss during 
transport and manufacturing process, as well as the correlation between cell-dose and engraftment in 
haematopoietic transplant medicine, in the Libmeldy studies higher volumes of BM were harvested for the 
manufacture of Libmeldy in some cases (ranging from 15.09 to 56.40 ml/kg patient body weight) depending 
on specific patient conditions and based upon an individualized risk-benefit assessment by the clinicians. The 
safety profile of BM harvest was consistent with the known safety and tolerability of the procedure. 
Therefore, collection of larger quantities than the standard volume used in allogenic setting can be accepted 
if this is needed to collect sufficient cell numbers for production of Libmeldy. Importantly, the SmPC 
adequately describes in the cellular source of choice and quantity of CD34+ cells required in section 4.2 and 
the safety profile of the BM harvest is described in section 4.8. In addition, the applicant will include 
recommendations regarding the BM harvest as part of the site qualification process.
The median volume of bone marrow harvested for the cryopreserved product was within the range of the 
bone marrow volume harvest for the manufacturing of the fresh product. A single leukapheresis procedure 
encompassing a maximum of two cell collection cycles (performed in up to 2 consecutive days) following 
mobilisation with G-CSF and Plerixafor, provided a sufficient number of CD34+ for both DP manufacture and 
Back up cells, in all patients treated with either formulation of Libmeldy.
Adverse events
The applicant has allocated the adverse events per pre-specified treatment phase: pre-treatment, treatment 
(first day conditioning – GT infusion), acute phase (up to 48 hours after GT), 3-month post GT phase (until 
day 100), short term phase (day 101 – 1098) and long-term phase (> 1098). In any given phase, only those 
adverse events that started during that phase were reported. Adverse events reported in previous phase(s) 
and were ongoing at the start of subsequent phase(s) were not reported in those subsequent phase(s). Thus, 
the data convey no information on the duration of the adverse events observed. Information was provided by 
the applicant on the median duration of common adverse events and adverse events rated grade 3 or higher. 
Adverse events related to MLD appear to be the most persistent events.   
EMA/584450/2020
Page 125/157
 
 
Overall, the number of days in hospital post-treatment for all patients treated with Libmeldy in the clinical 
development programme ranged from 37 to 94 days (approximately 4 to 12 weeks, as stated in the SmPC), 
in line with what is observed in the post-transplant course after a myeloablative conditioning regimen and in 
other gene therapy clinical trials. Two patients (Patient 14 and 21) stayed in hospital 82 days and 94 days 
post-treatment respectively, due to some complications considered unrelated to Libmeldy.
Adverse events were reported with a high frequency. The applicant assigned the common adverse events 
observed into 3 general categories: adverse reactions related to Libmeldy, adverse reactions related to 
busulfan conditioning and adverse reactions related to MLD. This will be discussed in further detail below.
In the pre-treatment phase, the most common adverse event is gallbladder enlargement (76%). This may be 
due to the underlying disease pathology, as no intervention has taken place yet. 
In the acute phase (≤ 48 hours after gene therapy) the only event reported was hepatomegaly (3%) which 
was likely attributable to busulfan conditioning.
In the 3-month post GT febrile neutropenia (79%), stomatitis (41%) and mucosal inflammation (34%) are 
most commonly reported. These events most likely are due to the busulfan conditioning regimen that 
subjects received prior to GT. An exception is the occurrence of rash erythematous (21%). A relationship with 
Libmeldy is considered unlikely, as the events did not occur immediately after infusion and subjects were 
taking medication concomitantly which are also known to cause rash. 
In the short-term follow up (100-1098 days post gene therapy), several adverse events are reported that 
appear suggestive of MLD disease progression, i.e. gait disturbance (31%), motor dysfunction (24%), muscle 
spasticity (31%) ataxia (10%), aphasia (14%), dysarthria (14%) and dysphagia (10%).
In the long term follow up (> 1098 days i.e. > 3 years post gene therapy), the common adverse events were 
upper respiratory tract infection (31%), vitamin D decreased (25%) and pyrexia (19%). The most common 
AEs during the long-term phase were related to infections and infestations (50% of subjects), predominantly 
of the upper respiratory tract (n=5, 31%). Most patients in the LI group were within the pre-school age (4-6 
years) and the rate of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) should be considered “normal” as observed 
within certain frequencies (up to 8 episodes of URTIs per year in the pediatric population) during pre-school 
age. There is no evidence suggesting a relationship between the frequency of infections during the long-term 
phase and immunological reconstitution. It is however recommended to follow-up infectious events and 
immunological parameters as part of the routine follow-up in ongoing studies. 
Adverse reactions related to conditioning regimen
AEs such as (febrile) neutropenia, other cytopenias, mucosal inflammation, stomatitis, venoocclusive disease, 
infections, and increases in liver enzymes are known to be associated with busulfan and it is agreed with the 
applicant that AE observed in these categories likely are due to the myeloablative conditioning. All grade ≥3 
infections occurring within the first 3 months resolved and none was reported as a SAE. Based on the 
duration of follow-up, long-term toxicity of the conditioning regimen cannot be determined, such as the 
occurrence of second primary malignancies. 
Overall, the safety profile of the busulfan conditioning regimen is as expected and substantial but 
manageable.
Adverse reactions related to Libmeldy
EMA/584450/2020
Page 126/157
 
 
The only AE that were related to Libmeldy treatment were anti ARSA antibody test positive in 4 (14%) 
subjects. The clinical consequences of positive anti ARSA antibodies will be discussed below in the section 
“Immunological events”.
Adverse reactions related to MLD
Symptoms of MLD were only reported if clinically significant and had an NCI Grade ≥ 3. In the integrated 
safety set, several subjects experienced adverse events which were attributed to MLD. The most frequent 
were gait disturbance (15 subjects), motor dysfunction (9 subjects), muscle spasticity (9 subjects) and 
aphasia (6 subjects). It is possible that other more subtle events are misclassified as not attributed to MLD or 
as they were not classified as grade 3 are higher. In the proposed PAES study, symptoms of MLD will be 
recorded regardless of severity. 
Serious adverse events
In the 3-month post GT phase, common adverse events graded 3 or higher were related to the busulfan 
conditioning (e.g. febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, and neutropenia). In the follow up serious events related to 
MLD were more commonly reported. 
There were two SAEs, both cases concerned atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). For one subject 
(Patient 21), it appears that prior events (e.g. positive anti CFH antibodies) and a specific genetic mutation 
made the subject more susceptible to aHUS. For the other subject (Patient 28), the requested narrative was 
provided and this case was determined to be transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), 
instead of aHUS. It was labelled as aHUS as TA-TMA does not exist in the MeDRA database. A discussion was 
provided on the relationship between MLD, aHUS and Libmeldy gene therapy for three cases Patient 21 
(aHUS), Patient 28(TA-TMA) and Patient 22, who is the monozygous twin of Patient 21. In two cases (Patient 
21 and 28), the events appear to have been caused by an interaction between predisposing risk factors such 
as age, the underlying MLD and in the case of Patient 21 genetic predisposition, and endothelial injury caused 
by the busulfan conditioning regime. Moreover, due to the development of aHUS in Patient 21 and the shared 
genetic predisposition, steps were taken in the gene therapy procedure for his twin to minimise the risk for 
aHUS development. Due to these countermeasures, the twin did not develop aHUS or TA-TMA. Based on the 
experience of TMA in these three cases, the applicant recommends prophylactic treatment with 
ursodeoxycholic acid and/or defibrotide prior to Libmeldy treatment in the SmPC, which is agreed.  
Deaths
Three deaths occurred in the clinical development programme of Libmeldy: two in the registrational study 
and one in the expanded access programme. Two subjects (Patient 19 and 20)  died due to MLD progression 
(dysphagia with fatal outcome). These are considered treatment failures. 
One subject (Patient 27) died due to an ischemic cerebral infarction. A relationship between the ischemic 
event and gene therapy appears unlikely as the event took place approximately a year post gene therapy. 
Notably, the subject was responsive to treatment. Further information related to the case suggests that an 
infection is likely the cause of the event, however it was not possible to determine whether this had a 
bacterial or viral origin.  
Adverse events of special interest
The applicant marks the following adverse events as significant and discusses them in more in detail: renal 
tubular acidosis / metabolic acidosis, hepatobiliary disorders, elevations in IgE and elevations in Ferritins. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 127/157
 
 
Therefore, these adverse events are grouped together by the assessors as “adverse events of special 
interest” and are discussed below.
Renal tubular acidosis/metabolic acidosis. There were 8 cases of renal tubular acidosis in the pre-treatment 
phase of the integrated safety set. Given the high number of subjects who had renal tubular acidosis prior to 
Libmeldy treatment, the applicant’s interpretation that these events are likely to be due to the underlying 
arylsulfatase deficiency is supported. Metabolic acidosis was reported by a total of 11 subjects across the 
treatment phases. The Lorioli (2015) article cited by the applicant discusses part of the current patient cohort 
where subjects with renal tubular acidosis prior to treatment experienced metabolic acidosis coinciding with 
other major events such as surgery, sepsis or neutropenia. A possible mechanism coined by the authors is 
that metabolic stress could exacerbate the dysfunction already present, leading to an acute increase in the 
loss of bicarbonate and a rapid worsening of metabolic acidosis. Though, as noted by the applicant, there 
were only two subjects in the programme which had renal tubular acidosis at baseline. Risks associated with 
the gene therapy can also exacerbate independently the risk of developing metabolic acidosis. Moreover, 
there were also subjects in the clinical development programme who had metabolic acidosis prior to the gene 
therapy procedures.
Nevertheless, subjects with MLD eligible for Libmeldy therapy have an increased risk for metabolic acidosis 
due to their underlying condition and that the gene therapy is associated with techniques and adverse events 
that can exacerbate metabolic stress. To account for this, the applicant has included metabolic acidosis as a 
common side effect in section 4.8 and an additional warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC is proposed. This is 
considered sufficient. Pending new information from the ongoing long-term safety evaluation the warning 
may need further amendment. 
Hepatobiliary disorders. Non serious gallbladder enlargement was reported in 22 subjects of the integrated 
safety set during the pre-treatment phase. Gallbladder polyps were reported in 4 subjects with a pre-existing 
gallbladder enlargement. In two subjects a cholecystectomy was performed to remove the gallbladder polyps. 
The applicant’s interpretation that enlarged gallbladder/gallbladder polyps are related to MLD and not a risk 
of treatment is supported. Diagnostic imaging evaluations were performed at baseline to evaluate any 
structural abnormality related to gallbladder, liver or kidney. But gallbladder abnormalities or metabolic 
acidosis detected at baseline were not sufficient to exclude any subject from the trial. Therefore, the treating 
physician should confirm that the hepatic and renal functions are appropriate before the start of 
myeloablative conditioning, as is reported in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Elevations in IgE, glucose and ferritins. IgE, glucose, ferritins and protein electrophoresis were measured as 
part of routine surveillance in accordance with the San Raffaele hospital guideline. There are no safety signs 
from the available safety data on IgE, glucose, ferritins and protein electrophoresis that would warrant 
consequences for the SmPC. 
Laboratory measurements & vital signs
Haematology. After the busulfan conditioning, all patients had ANC <500/μL and most (93%) had absolute 
aplasia (ANC 0) which is expected. The geometric mean (95% CI) number of days with ANC of 0 was 4.6 
days and the mean number of days with ANC <500 μL was 27.6 days. In total 5 patients received G-CSF (3 
after MAC and 2 after SMAC). Prolonged neutropenia was the reason for G-CSF treatment in 4 patients and 
febrile neutropenia in 1. Furthermore, it seems that neutrophil engraftment after busulfan might be slower 
for MLD patients treated with Libmeldy compared to what is described in the SmPC of busulfan and Zynteglo. 
According to the applicant this is likely due to the pre-specified use of G-CSF after gene therapy. In the 
Libmeldy protocol, G-CSF treatment was allowed at day 45 post-treatment in case of prolonged neutropenia. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 128/157
 
 
As described above, 4/29 patients (14%) received G-CSF due to prolonged neutropenia as per protocol in the 
absence of any concomitant acute illness/infection. According to the SmPC of Zynteglo, a total of 28.6% of 
patients received G-CSF within 21 days after Zynteglo infusion. 
Also thrombocytopenia was, not unexpected, frequently observed after busulfan conditioning. The median 
number of days to platelet engraftment was 41 (range: 14 to 109 days) with Libmeldy treatment, which is 
longer than expected and comparable to what was observed for Zynteglo for which delayed platelet 
engraftment was noted as identified risk. All patients treated with Libmeldy received transfusion support with 
platelets and these infusions were considered part of the standard of care/prophylaxis for these subjects. In 
addition, platelet transfusions were given also for the treatment of adverse events (thrombocytopenia, febrile 
neutropenia, and epistaxis). There was one patient who experienced thrombocytopenia leading to clinical 
sequelae. This event was seen in MLD-HE01 during the 3-months post-GT phase in a complex post-transplant 
course, with SAEs of thrombocytopenia, prolonged anaemia, VOD and TA-TMA captured as atypical 
haemolytic uremic syndrome (Day 41). Although it is reassuring that no serious bleedings occurred, the 
information regarding the delayed platelet engraftment is included as a warning in the SmPC and as an 
important identified risk. According to the RMP, the important identified safety concern of delayed platelet 
engraftment will be further characterised after the treatment of new patients in the context of clinical trials 
open to recruitment (Study 205756 and Study Libmeldy-07), and the treatment of patients after Libmeldy 
marketing authorisation (MA) approval and followed up as part of LongTERM-MLD study. 
Other myelosuppressive effects, such as anaemia, lymphopenia, and lymphocytopenia occurred as expected. 
All the patients in the integrated safety set received transfusion support. Most of these transfusions were 
received during the peri-transplant period and mainly within the three months post gene therapy (≤100 
days). One patient had a blood transfusion after 100 days post-GT (Day 382) after a decrease in 
haemoglobin concurrent to aspiration pneumonia. None of the 29 subjects in the integrated safety set 
received erythropoietin. Moreover, PTT value was reported above normal reference range in 11/28 patients 
(39%). Since this ADR does not appear in the busulfan EU PI, it cannot be reflected in PI as associated to 
busulfan. It is also agreed that this ADR should not be mentioned outside of the ADR table in section 4.8 
because a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse 
event would be needed, and this would not be the case for Libmeldy. Furthermore, the ADR cannot be 
confirmed at present as related to busulfan as it is not mentioned in the EU PI.
Chemistry. Increased liver enzymes were generally observed in the beginning of the treatment but returned 
to normal values around Month 3. There was one case meeting Hy’s law criteria (MLD17) which is probably 
explained by the use of busulfan and concomitant medication and not by Libmeldy. The increases in liver 
enzymes and hepatomegaly are known for busulfan and are described in the SmPC. There are currently no 
hepatic safety concerns associated with the administration of Libmeldy. 
Thyroid status. Accurate monitoring of the thyroid status in MLD patients is of pivotal importance because of 
the well-known effect of thyroid hormones on brain and body development, particularly in very young 
children. In general, increases in TSH, FT4 and FT3 were observed following treatment with Libmeldy, 
however plasma levels of these hormones were not specified. Plasma levels of thyroid parameters (TSH, FT3 
and FT4) were provided. In general, increases in TSH, FT4 and FT3 were observed over the course of the 
study, but the variations in timings suggest that these increases should be unrelated to one another, as well 
as to gene therapy or associated procedures. However, during the study, clinicians did not detect any pattern 
of signs or symptoms in any subject to raise clinical concern for a thyroid disorder. It is appropriate to 
monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and shortly after treatment due to the risk of thyroid disorders

being masked by a critical illness or induced by concomitant medication given to children whilst in intensive 
care as is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Lentivirus infectious particles. While residual LVV infectious particles are present in the drug product, the risk 
for secondary infection in patients due to these residual infectious virus particles is considered negligent. 
Furthermore, testing for replication competent lentivirus did not result in any confirmed positive sample for 
RCL.
Malignancies and abnormal clonal proliferation. No malignancies were reported in the Follow-up after 
treatment with Libmeldy-f or Libmeldy-c. In addition, there was no sign of clonal dominance or clonal 
proliferation from insertion site analyses. Nevertheless, this important potential risk will have to be followed 
post-approval as FU is too short to exclude this risk.
Special populations
Adverse events by MLD variant (LI, EJ). Upon request a table of the most common adverse events per MLD 
variant was provided per SOC and by preferred term. In general, a higher percentage of subjects with EJ MLD 
(85%) compared to patients with LI MLD (38%) experienced AEs during the treatment phase, and SAEs 
during the follow-up phase (77% of EJ vs. 63% of LI). In the LI group the most frequent AEs were infections 
(100% of patients), in particular upper respiratory tract infections (56%), or device related infection (44%). 
In the EJ group, febrile neutropenia was the most frequent AE (92% of patients vs. 69% of LI), whereas 
infections were observed in 77% of patients. With respect to the busulfan conditioning regimen, 20 patients 
were treated with MAC (14 EJ and 6 LI) and 13 subjects were treated with SMAC (12 LI and 1 EJ). The higher 
frequency of febrile neutropenia in EJ vs LI patients was likely to be attributed to prolonged neutropenia due 
to higher exposure to a conditioning regimen, as a common adverse event related to busulfan. Moreover, 
most of the subjects who received the MAC regimen were in the EJ cohort compared to the LI cohort (69% vs 
44%). However, none of the events of febrile neutropenia were clinically significant and all resolved in a few 
days (median 3.5 days, range 2-5 days).
Considering the role of myeloablative conditioning level in the report of specific SAEs, percentages of subjects 
who experienced moderate events (63% in MAC versus 69% in SMAC), severe events (94% in MAC versus 
92% in SMAC) and life-threatening events (13% in MAC versus 8% in SMAC) were comparable between both 
groups. However, while full myeloablative conditioning might be related to a higher report of events of febrile 
neutropenia in the EJ population, this does not seem to have an impact on the report of events related to 
SOC ‘infections and infestations’ or to SOC ‘nervous system disorder. In fact, the higher number of LI 
patients reporting an infective event in the short and long-term phase compared to EJ (88% LI vs 69% EJ 
and 88% vs 13% respectively) might be related to the younger age of LI vs EJ and/or a more immature 
immune system predisposing LI patients to a higher level of infections than older EJ patients.
On the other hand, neurological adverse events associated with MLD such as motor dysfunction, muscle 
spasticity, aphasia, ataxia, dysarthria, cognitive disorder and seizure were more common in patients who 
were symptomatic at the time of treatment than in subjects who were pre-symptomatic. In particular, only 
6% of subjects in the LI cohort vs 57% of subjects in the EJ cohort were symptomatic at time of gene 
therapy, and nervous system disorders were observed in 69% of EJ subjects during follow-up post gene 
therapy compared to 38% of LI during the same period. Given that MAC was the prevalent conditioning 
regimen used in EJ patients, at present it cannot be ruled out that busulfan as myeloablative condition 
regimen may contribute to the neurological disorders of these patients. However, the SmPC includes specific 
text related to the prevention and management of infective and neurological adverse events related to the 
use of busulfan, in particular about the prophylactic measures to be taken before administering busulfan.
EMA/584450/2020

Adverse events by symptomatic status. The integrated safety set population was broadly divided into 
subjects who were pre-symptomatic or symptomatic at the time of treatment. As expected, subjects who 
were symptomatic experienced more adverse events due to MLD. There was no different pattern for the non-
MLD associated adverse events between the two subgroups. 
Adverse events by conditioning regimen 
Acknowledging the small numbers of the subgroups, differences are noted between the safety profiles of 
SMAC versus MAC, with more toxicity observed in the MAC regimen as to be expected. For example, patients 
treated with MAC experienced more grade 3 AEs in the treatment phase and the total number of events in 
the three months post-GT phase was also higher. It also seems that the incidences are higher in the MAC vs 
SMAC regimen for febrile neutropenia and stomatitis and duration of neutropenia was longer in the MAC 
group.
Adverse events with cryopreserved formulation. 
The amount of safety data available for the cryopreserved formulation is too limited to draw any conclusions. 
However, there is no apparent difference in safety between the fresh formulation and cryopreserved 
formulation. Also, the provided data in the Quality dossier support comparability between the fresh and 
cryopreserved DP formulations. At the time of MAA submission, only preliminary safety data from the first 4 
subjects treated with Libmeldy-c was available and it was noted that more prolonged severe neutropenia was 
observed after Libmeldy-c. The mean number of days with an ANC of 0 was 20.7 days (range 15-29 days), 
much higher than the 4.6 days (range 1.81 to 11.50 days) observed with the fresh product. Based on data 
from 5 additional subjects treated in Study 205756, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the 
duration of neutropenia (ANC<500/ul) nor absolute aplasia (ANC=0) between both OTL-200 formulations. 
The median of days in neutropenia reported was 28 days (range 13 to 39 days) in subjects who received the 
fresh formulation (N=29) compared with 32 days (range 14 to 40 days) in subjects who received the 
cryopreserved formulation (N=9). The geometric mean number of days with absolute aplasia (ANC=0) was 
4.6 in subjects treated with Libmeldy-f vs. 9.8 days in subjects treated with Libmeldy-c, whereas the range of 
days in absolute aplasia was comparable for both formulations (Libmeldy-f: range 0 to 28 days; Libmeldy-c: 
range: 3 to 29 days). No additional subjects treated with the cryopreserved formulation experienced 
prolonged neutropenia requiring G-CSF treatment. No trend of higher rate of infections was observed in 
subjects treated with the cryopreserved formulation when compared with the Integrated Data set of subjects 
treated with Libmeldy-f during the first 3 months post-treatment.  
For commercialisation, Libmeldy will be manufactured as a cryopreserved formulation. Additional data 
indicate that the cryopreserved formulation of Libmeldy shows comparable haematological recovery with the 
fresh formulation of Libmeldy.
Immunological events
Anti ARSA Antibodies (AAA) have been detected in 4 subjects, all with late infantile MLD, and all from the 
expanded access programme. For one subject this event resolved spontaneously, for the other 3 cases the 
events resolved following a course of rituximab treatment. Following the new data-cut, there were two new 
AAA events: one re-emergence in one subject (Patient 28) and one new case in another subject (LI) from the 
cryopreserved study. Graphical presentations were provided by the applicant that plots the AAA titres over 
time against ARSA activity in PBMCs, rituximab treatment, GMFM score/GMFC-MLD level and concurrent 
adverse events. There were two cases (Patient 25 and 28) where AAAs were observed followed by reporting 
of gait disturbance. A temporal relationship was acknowledged however no firm conclusions can be drawn 
considering the very low titres of AAAs in these subjects, the lack of impact on pharmacodynamic effects and 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 131/157
 
 
the persistence of motor dysfunction well after AAA turned negative in one subject (Patient 25) or the limited 
duration of the gait disturbance reported for the other patient (Patient 28). Overall, there appears to be no 
correlation between the course of the antibody titres, the ARSA activity and clinical outcomes. Moreover, 
antibody titres were generally low. Further information was provided that indicated that the subject from the 
cryopreserved study has been AAA negative from the Day 90 scheduled test. At the year 3 visit, Patient 28 
still had a positive AAA test but the titre was low (1:400) and no events were reported that coincided with 
the occurrence that are suggestive of disease progression/lack of efficacy. Additional graphs were provided 
that plotted ARSA activity in CSF against AAA titres. Based upon the provided plots it appears that the 
occurrence of AAAs does not impact CSF ARSA activity. Rituximab treatment was initiated in 2 subjects 
following the detection of AAAs. In the other 2 subjects rituximab treatment was started due to concurrent 
presence of other auto antibodies. Based upon the data so far, there appears to be no suggestion that the 
presence of AAAs would impact Libmeldy’s efficacy. However, as this only concerns a small sample, no 
definitive conclusions can be drawn.  Recommendations have been formulated on how to monitor AAAs in the 
SmPC and what to do in case of an AAA positive test. Furthermore, AAAs will continue to be monitored in the 
proposed PAES. This is currently considered sufficient to address the occurrence of AAAs. 
From the perspective of autoimmunity, there are no published cases or reports of MLD causing an 
autoimmune susceptibility or evidence that autoimmunity would predispose to anti-ARSA antibodies. 
Premature study withdrawal due to adverse events
Three subjects (10%) prematurely withdrew from the study. 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
The safety assessment is based on a limited number of patients (n=35) with a relatively limited duration of 
follow up in the integrated dataset (median duration 4.51 years (range: 0.64 to 8.85 years) for patients 
treated with fresh formulation) given the irreversibility of treatment, but the safety of Libmeldy so far is as 
expected for a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy preceded by myeloablative conditioning 
regimen. Most of the adverse events observed appear related to the busulfan conditioning regimen. The 
adverse event attributed to Libmeldy specifically was Anti-ARSA Antibody test positive, and this occurred 
infrequently and did not appear to impact efficacy thus far.
The CAT considered the following measures necessary to ensure the follow-up of adverse drug reactions:
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Libmeldy in children with late infantile or 
early juvenile forms of MLD, the MAH will conduct and submit the results of a prospective study based on 
data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

 Conclusion
The CHMP, CAT and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.10.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.
2.11.  New Active Substance
The applicant declared that autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that contains haematopoietic stem 
and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A gene has 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 138/157
 
 
not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union.
The CAT/CHMP, based on the available data, considers autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that 
contains haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the 
human arylsulfatase A gene to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product 
previously authorised within the Union.
2.12.  Product information
2.12.1.  User consultation
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
2.12.2.  Labelling exemptions
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons:
The applicant requested the use of minimum particulars on small immediate packaging units for infusion bag 
label. The QRD requested in a first instance to explore if the label on the infusion bag could have double-
sided printing which would allow inclusion of the full particulars. If this option is not considered a viable 
solution, the Group would accept the use of minimum particulars on small immediate packaging units, as the 
full particulars would be included in the overwrapping and outer labels. Further to additional clarifications 
from the applicant explaining the challenges of double-sided printing, the Group accepted to have minimum 
particulars on small immediate packaging units for infusion bag label. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials. 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons:
The applicant requested English-only on immediate, intermediate, outer packaging and lot information sheet. 
The Group noted that out of the estimated patients to be treated till 2026, a high proportion would be 
German speaking, therefore dual DE/EN would be preferable to EN only. The Group thereby requested that 
simplifications to the labelling be considered (e.g. statement on children may be removed; greying out of 
pharmaceutical form) to explore whether DE/EN labelling could be feasible. Further to additional clarifications 
from the applicant the Group accepted to have EN only labelling. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials 
will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group.

2.12.3.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004,  autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that 
contains haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the 
human arylsulfatase A gene is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance 
which, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder 
caused by mutations in the ARSA gene that results in deficiency of its corresponding enzyme. 
ARSA deficiency results in accumulation of the undegraded substrate, cerebroside 3 sulfate, in lysosomes of 
oligodendrocytes, microglia, certain neurons of the CNS, Schwann cells and macrophages of the PNS, and 
other non-neural tissues (e.g., gallbladder, liver, pancreas, and kidneys). Accumulation in the nervous 
system, in turn, leads to microglial damage, progressive demyelination, neurodegeneration, and subsequent 
loss of motor and cognitive functions and early death, especially in patients with early disease onset 
(Bergner, 2019, Gieselmann, 2010, van Rappard, 2015). 
There is no universally accepted classification system for MLD phenotypes and at least 3 clinical forms of the 
disease are commonly described (late infantile [LI], juvenile, and adult MLD) (Von Figura, 2001, Kolodny, 
1995). Of note, the juvenile forms are further stratified into early (EJ) and late juvenile (LJ). It is reported 
that the underlying disease pathophysiology described above is common for all phenotypic forms of MLD 
(Biffi, 2008a). 
Regardless of the clinical classification, the clinical course of the disease can be broadly divided into a pre-
symptomatic stage with normal motor and cognitive development, followed by onset of first symptoms and a 
period of developmental plateau which is short in early onset forms and longer and more variable in late 
onset forms. In the absence of treatment able to modify the disease pathophysiology, the disease inevitably 
ends in decerebrated state and eventually death, although its course and duration are highly variable, 
particularly in late-onset MLD variants (Biffi, 2008b, van Rappard, 2015, Elgun, 2019).
In LI symptoms manifestation starts before 30 months of age. LI patients have the most aggressive form of 
the disease with a highly predictable and severe disease course, characterised by progressive decline in 
motor and cognitive function and an early death (Gieselmann, 2010, van Rappard, 2015).
The phenotypic variability is particularly evident in the juvenile and adult variants and is observed in terms of 
clinical presentation, age at disease onset and dynamics in the rate of disease progression (Biffi, 2008a, Biffi, 
2008b, Lugowska, 2005, Polten, 1991). Patients who are affected by the early juvenile (EJ) variant typically 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 140/157
 
 
carry one null allele and one residual allele (0/R genotype), have symptom onset between the ages of 30 
months and 6 years of age (i.e., have not celebrated their 7th birthday), and tend to have slower and more 
variable initial disease progression compared to LI MLD (Groeschel, 2016). LJ MLD (age of disease onset ≥7 
years and <17 years) and adult MLD patients (age of disease onset ≥17), on the other hand typically carry 2 
residual alleles (R/R genotype) and predominantly develop cognitive and behavioral symptoms that can 
precede the deterioration of gait and motor function and have more prolonged, less rapid disease progression 
compared to early-onset (LI and EJ) variants (Biffi, 2008a, Biffi, 2008b, Gieselmann, 2010).
The applicant originally proposed a broad indication which included all paediatric MLD disease variants, i.e. 
irrespective of symptomatic status. However, based on the analysis of the data, it was concluded that efficacy 
is the greatest in treated pre-symptomatic patients and for early symptomatic EJ MLD patients, prognostic 
values were identified. These are included in the indication and section 5.1 of the SmPC.
The applicant also removed the LJ MLD disease variant from the indication as full extrapolation was not 
considered appropriate, due to differences in disease progression, the B/R should be weight differently and, 
as the efficacy is impacted by the symptomatic status, the prognostic values for these patients are currently  
unclear as these subjects are currently identified when already symptomatic.  
The applicant amended the indication as requested to:
 is indicated for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by biallelic mutations in 
the arysulfatase A (ARSA) gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic activity:
- in children with late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease,
- in children with the early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have the 
ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline 
(see section 5.1).
This indication will ensure that treatment success is maximized.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
There is currently no curative treatment for MLD. Available treatments only address the symptoms of the 
disease and none of them have proven a consistent effect on the fatal outcome. Allogeneic haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used for the treatment of MLD but results have been inconsistent. 
The unmet medical need for patients with MLD has been acknowledged in the applicant’s request for 
accelerated assessment. 
In support of this indication, results have been submitted from 33 subjects who were treated in 5 submitted 
studies by the applicant: 1 registrational study (201222), 3 Expanded access programme studies (207394, 
205029 and 206225) and 1 quality comparative study (205756). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
Study 201222 was a non-randomised, open-label, prospective, comparative (historical control), single 
centre study in 20 subjects with MLD. Nine subjects were classified as having late infantile (LI) MLD (8 pre-
symptomatic) and 11 subjects were classified as early juvenile (EJ) MLD (4 pre-symptomatic). 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 141/157
 
 
LI MLD (n=9) was defined as patients with an age at onset in the older sibling ≤30 months, and/or 2 null (0) 
mutant ARSA alleles, and/or peripheral neuropathy at electroneurographic study. EJ MLD (n=11) was defined 
as age of onset in the subject or effected sibling between 30 months and 7th birthday, and/or 1 null (0) and 1 
residual (R) mutant ARSA alleles, and/or peripheral neuropathy at electroneurographic. These correspond 
with the general distinction for the MLD variants. All LI MLD and some EJ MLD subjects were identified after 
an older sibling developed symptoms and was diagnosed with MLD, prompting family testing.  
The study consisted of 4 phases, i.e. Screening phase, Baseline phase, Treatment phase and Follow Up phase 
of 8 years. 
The treatment phase included a cell harvest phase for investigational DP manufacture on Day -4 and busulfan 
conditioning phase (Day -4 to Day -1) and an administration phase where the gene therapy was applied (Day 
0). During the study, several changes were introduced by the applicant involving different parts of the 
treatment phase, these include changes to the drug product manufacturing, addition of peripheral blood (PB) 
as possible source for CD34+ instead of bone marrow (BM) (for 1 subject PB was used) and a switch from a 
SMAC busulfan conditioning regimen to a MAC regimen during the study. With the SMAC regimen 14 doses of 
weight-based busulfan were administered every 6 hours from Day -4 to Day -1. A target dose AUC of 4800 
μg*h/L (range 4200 to 5600 μg*h/L) was used, corresponding to an expected total cumulative AUC of 67,200 
µg*h/L (range 58,800 to 78,400 mg*h/L). For the MAC regimen, a total of 4 doses were administered every 
20-24 hours from Day -4 to Day -1 with target total cumulative AUC of 85,000 μg*h/L (range 76,500 to 
93,500 μg*h/L).
Primary outcomes were total gross motor function measure (GMFM) score and the ARSA Activity in total 
PBMCs, both at 2 years post treatment. Results were compared to a natural history cohort (NHx cohort), 
matched by age, MLD variant and symptomatic status. 
Secondary endpoints included ARSA activity in BM and CSF, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), Brain MRI 
score, gross motor function classification for MLD (GMFC-MLD), neuropsychological tests, neurological 
evaluations, survival, engraftment (lentiviral vector transduced cells, vector copy number/cell). The study 
included comparison to a natural history cohort (NHx represented by 31 untreated early-onset MLD patients 
(19 LI and 12 EJ, all symptomatic) and where available untreated siblings (a proportion of subjects were 
siblings of the patients treated with Libmeldy).    
The effect of treatment was analysed for the LI MLD and EJ MLD population separately, as the rate of disease 
progression is different for these variants. In addition, the symptomatic status may also affect the treatment 
effect therefore analyses of treatment effect by symptomatic status (‘pre-symptomatic’ or ‘symptomatic’) has 
also been included.  
For the EJ MLD population, the applicant defined early-symptomatic as part of an inclusion criterium, 
therefore not all EJ MLD patients identified were treated. Early symptomatic was initially defined as within 6 
months after the first reported symptom, and later as subjects with an intelligence quotient ≥70 and the 
ability to walk independently for ≥10 steps. In the discussion of efficacy results, early symptomatic is 
referred to as patients meeting the eligibility criteria for treatment, i.e. IQ ≥ 85 and GMFC-MLD ≤1.
3.2.  Favourable effects
Co-Primary endpoint
ARSA Activity
EMA/584450/2020
Page 142/157
 
 
The mean ARSA activity increased in all treated subjects in the total PBMCs, BM and CSF to levels above (for 
PBMCs and BM) or within the range (for CSF) observed in healthy subjects within 3 months after treatment.  
At year 2 post treatment, the mean ARSA activity in the CSF was 0.85 nmol/mg/hr (95%CI 0.58; 1.25) for 
the LI MLD subjects (n=9) and 0.64 nmol/mg/hr (95%CI 0.37; 1.13) for the EJ MLD subjects (n=11). In the 
individual profiles fluctuations and drops of ARSA activity levels in the CSF can be noted.
Gross Motor Function Measurement
For the Late Infantile MLD 2 years post-treatment, mean total GMFM score in the Libmeldy treated LI MLD 
subjects was 72.5% compared to 7.4% for the LI MLD NHx subjects (Difference 65.1 %, 95%CI 41.6%; 
88.6%), p<0.001).
For the overall Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD subjects (n= 11) the mean total GMFM score at 2 years was 76.5% 
for the Libmeldy treatment group compared to 36.6 % for the EJ MLD NHx cohort (Difference 39.8 % 95%CI 
9.6%; 80.1%, p=0.026). 
The subgroup of pre-symptomatic EJ MLD (n=4) had an adjusted mean GMFM total score of 96.7%, while for 
the NHx a mean GMFM total score of 44.3% was reported. The difference between the Libmeldy treated and 
corresponding NHx subjects was 52.4% (95%CI 25.1%; 79.6%, p=0.008) at Year 2. In the subgroup of 
symptomatic EJ MLD (n=8) at Year 2 and Year 3 there was a difference in treatment effect of 28.7% (60.7% 
vs 31.9% in the untreated NHs control; p=0.350) and 43.9% (59.8% vs. 15.9%; p=0.054), respectively. At 
Year 4 and Year 5 this difference was confirmed (42.9% for both: 53.6% vs. 10.7% [p=0.054] and 50.3% 
vs. 7.4% [p=0-107], respectively). 
Secondary outcomes
Engraftment of Lentiviral vector in BM
Engraftment of bone marrow derived colonies harbouring the lentiviral genome was successful in all treated 
subjects. Levels of cells containing the Lentiviral vector in the BM increased within 28 days to 59.1% and was 
54.8% (CI 95% 44.1; 68.2%, [n=23]) at Year 1 post treatment. At Year 5, that proportion was 45.0% 
(CI95% 24.1%; 84.2% [n=6]). The VCN in the PBMCs increased to approximately 1 VCN/cell for the LI MLD 
and approximately 0.25 VCN/cell for the EJ MLD. 
VCN values in total PBMCs had a geometric mean of 0.19 copies/cell (range 0.03 to 0.68; n=29) at Day 28 
post gene therapy. In both the LI MLD and EJ MLD subgroups, the VCN in total PBMCs increased over time 
until 3 months and remained relatively stable throughout the course of follow-up. 
Brain MRI
For the LI MLD subject the MRI outcome was consistent with the GMFM scores, i.e. the MRI score mean 
differences between Libmeldy treated LI subjects and NHx subject of -11.8 (p<0.001). Individual plots show 
stabilisation over time. 
For the EJ MLD the difference between the Libmeldy treatment group and NHx was -4.1 points, p=0.12, on 
brain MRI. For the pre-symptomatic EJ MLD subject the differences in the adjusted LS mean MRI total scores 
between the Libmeldy treated pre-symptomatic EJ subjects and NHx subjects was 10.7 (95%CI 7.0, 14.4; 
p<0.001). For the symptomatic EJ MLD patients the difference in LS mean MRI total score between the 
Libmeldy treated symptomatic subjects and NHX was 5.8 (95% CI -4.0, 15.5; P=0.21). Individual plots in 
symptomatic and pre-symtomatic EJ subjects show stabilisation over time. 
Cognitive performance
EMA/584450/2020
Page 143/157
 
 
The cognitive performance was within range reported for healthy subjects for the majority of the LI MLD 
subjects.
For the EJ MLD, all 4 subjects who were treated prior to the onset of symptoms had neuropsychological 
composite scores that were largely within or above the normal range (score of 100 +/- SD of 15) at the time 
of the data cut-off, with the exception of the Processing Speed Index.
Throughout the extended follow-up period, 6/8 Early Symptomatic EJ subjects remained stable and above the 
threshold for sever cognitive impairment (IQ≥55) with difference from the NHx controls at Year 2 (IQ 88.9 
vs. 31.9 in NHx controls; treatment difference 61.1, p=0.029), Year 3 (89.4 vs. 17.6; treatment difference 
71.8, p=0.013), Year 4 (81.9 vs. 15.2; treatment difference 66.8, p=0.026), but not at Year 5 (48.2 vs. 9.8).
Survival
A borderline statistically significant difference was observed for overall survival of the LI MLD subjects as 
compared to the NHx cohort (0/9 vs 12/19, unstratified Log-rank p-value 0.062) while no statistically 
significant differences were found for the EJ MLD subjects (estimated HR 1.85; log rank p-value= 0.537). In 
the EJ MLD subgroup 2 deaths occurred, due to disease progression. Both concern patients that were early 
symptomatic at start of treatment and who would not meet the current proposed criteria for treatment with 
Libmeldy. 
The expanded access programmes included pre-symptomatic LI MLD and EJ MLD patients only. The data 
from these confirm the effect on motor- and cognitive function if the ARSA levels in the CSF are maintained 
above a threshold. Here also a fluctuation in CSF ARSA activity levels is observed. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Historically, the product has been manufactured as a fresh (i.e. non-frozen) formulation using bone marrow 
(BM) as starting material. In the MAA, the applicant also applies for the use of mobilised peripheral blood 
(mPB). This is sufficiently supported by comparability data. Some immunophenotypic differences in cell 
composition are observed and VCN and ARSA activity in batches manufactured from mPB was on average 
lower in mPB-derived batches. VCN and ARSA activity was, however, within the range observed for BM-
derived batches. From the clinical data there are no indications that the immunophenotypic differences result 
in differences in clinical outcome. It is noted, that analytical results and adverse trends will be further 
monitored as part of the CPV programme. In addition, follow-up data will be gathered for the patients treated 
with mPB derived batches.
During development, several changes were made to the manufacturing procedure of the vector and the Drug 
Substance and the Drug Product formulation was changed to a cryopreserved product. Sufficient data are 
provided to support comparability. Although considerable batch-to-batch variability in e.g. VCN is observed, 
in general the differences cannot be linked to differences in DS/DP or vector manufacturing procedures. 
There are no indications that the changes in manufacturing procedure have negatively impacted product 
quality or clinical efficacy. The slightly lower cell viability in the cryopreserved DP is expected and gives no 
reason for concern.
A more in-depth evaluation of VCN in DP batches during development was performed as there was concern 
that higher VCN in more recent batches may be associated with lower ARSA activity in CSF and higher MRI 
scores after 1 year of treatment. The results showed that there has been no drift towards higher VCN with 
the commercial process. A comparison of the clinical data showed no negative impact of high DP VCN on 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 144/157
 
 
engraftment, ARSA activity in CSF and PBMC, MRI scores, or clinical efficacy (motor function). However, the 
data also show that that levels of cells with VCN> 10 were considerably lower in the patient samples 1 year 
after treatment compared to DP, suggesting preferential engraftment of subpopulations with low VCN or loss 
of cells with higher VCN. The potential disappearance of cells with high VCN in the patients could give rise to 
a concern with respect to sustained efficacy. In addition, the high percentage of cells with VCN > 10 (up to 
44% in DP batches) could be a reason to be cautious with respect to safety. It is therefore considered 
important to continue analyzing the circulating cells (and their VCN) in the patients. The applicant has 
committed to this in a post-authorisation study, however, only a synopsis was submitted. If sufficient data 
are available, the DP specifications should be re-evaluated taking into account the results of the clinical 
monitoring (e.g. VCN, ARSA activity, clinical efficacy). In addition to the changes in the manufacturing 
process mentioned above, the applicant also changed the busulfan conditioning regimen. The data in the 
Libmeldy studies do not show clear differences in terms of engraftment efficiency and ARSA activity between 
SMAC and MAC and it is not possible to have one of the regimens as preferred choice. The choice should be 
left to the treating physician based on an individual benefit/risk assessment.
The primary efficacy endpoints, i.e. ARSA activity and GMFM total score, were assessed at a fixed time point 
at 2 years post treatment. With respect to the GMFM the longitudinal evaluation is considered more 
appropriate, as this gives a better representation of the overall course of the efficacy in relation to the 
disease progression. For the majority of the LI MLD the effect observed on the GMFM at 2 years is also 
reflected in the overall longitudinal pattern. In contrast for all symptomatic EJ MLD subjects on group level a 
difference of 28.7% from the NHx is observed 2 years post treatment, while the individual panel plots showed 
deterioration on GMFM. The deterioration on individual level was slowed or halted in subject who would meet 
the current treatment criteria. This deterioration was also observed in other outcomes, e.g. cognitive 
function, survival etc. 
However, for symptomatic patients meeting the proposed criteria of IQ≥85 and GMFC-MLD ≤1, the cognitive 
functions appear to be maintained as these subjects perform equal to their healthy peers. These criteria are 
based on limit data but are accepted by lack of better. If more follow up data becomes available these criteria 
may need to be adapted. Further identification of prognostic factors for response, i.e. target population, 
should be part of the post-authorisation study. 
Effects on group level are diluted due to wide inter-individual variability for the different clinical outcomes. 
Moreover, the individual profiles for different clinical outcomes of the symptomatic subjects indicate disease 
progression, particularly for motor function. However, as cognitive function can be preserved if treated early, 
there may be window of opportunity. Therefore, the criteria should be evaluated regularly and adjusted if the 
new available data suggest this. 
In the individual plots for ARSA activity in the CSF a decrease in ARSA activity levels can be noted which 
cannot be explained by assay variability. It remains unclear if the ARSA activity levels in the CSF are 
maintained over time as the decrease in ARSA levels observed were in the last part of the follow up.  The 
applicant hypothesized that as the ARSA activity is normalized based on total CSF protein the decrease notes 
is due to an increase in protein in the CSF over time in MLD subjects. This could not be verified. The applicant 
has indicated to further evaluate the relationship between CSF protein content and ARSA activity. This would 
allow evaluation of ARSA CSF activity as predicting factor for treatment success or explanation of failure.  
No consistent correlation between the reconstitution of normal ARSA activity and clinical benefit in terms of 
decrease of gross motor function deterioration could be determined, which questions the ability of the ARSA 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 145/157
 
 
activity as co-primary endpoint to predict clinical benefit. Similarly, no statistically significant correlations 
were found between engraftment parameters and clinical outcome measures (i.e. GMFM at Year 2 and Year 3 
timepoints post-treatment). 
Statistically significant correlations were found between VCN and enzymatic activity in PBMCs at year 2 and 
Year 3 post-treatment while no correlation was observed between engraftment parameters and ARSA activity 
in CSF.
Two years post treatment, the time point analysis for the MRI for LI MLD, EJ MLD and the pre-symptomatic 
and symptomatic EJ MLD subgroups, corresponds with the group effects seen in GFMF at 2 years post 
treatment. However, it is noted that the individual longitudinal MRI data do not correlate well with the 
individual clinical outcome as for some subjects, deterioration is observed in the longitudinal data from GMFM 
and other secondary outcomes, while the MRI score remained stable from 2 years post treatment to the data 
cut off. 
The quality of life was not directly assessed, however, data in the treated pre-symptomatic subject from both 
school performance and parent reported outcomes indicate that these subjects perform as healthy peers and 
go about their daily activities without special assistance. 
The duration of follow-up is considered limited for this type of gene therapy and this precludes to draw 
definite conclusions on the long-term efficacy in terms of persistence of engraftment levels of LVV transduced 
cells, PD parameters (namely, central and peripheral ARSA activity levels), and of treatment effects on 
clinical (including neuroimaging and neurophysiology) outcome measures as well as on the long-term safety 
particularly in terms of insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis. The applicant will address these further in a 
post-authorisation study.
The reason for the observed numerical differences in engraftment levels of LV+ CD34+ cells and VCN per cell, 
between LI and EJ patients and by disease stage, is not understood at present, although it could be 
hypothesized a role for the type of conditioning regimen in the two MLD variants. In addition, a trend towards 
a reduction in the proportion of LV+ cells in BM over time was observed in both LI and EJ patients, that could 
be interpreted as a possible indicator for time-dependent decrease in treatment effect. 
Efficacy in pre-symptomatic LI MLD and EJ MLD subjects was already concluded previously. For the 
symptomatic patients the efficacy was questioned as deterioration was observed in all symptomatic patients 
on motor function. However, data in early symptomatic EJ-MLD subjects indicate that the rate of motor 
function decline is decreased and may even be halted. Furthermore, for these early symptomatic EJ-MLD 
patients the cognitive function is maintained as subjects perform within or above ranges observed for heathy 
subjects of the same age. This observation is in line with the progression of EJ MLD, which starts with loss of 
motor function followed by cognitive function. It thus appears that there is a window of opportunity for 
symptomatic EJ MLD population. The maintenance of cognitive function is considered a clinical benefit of the 
treatment. The prognostic factors for treatment success in early symptomatic subjects will be further 
investigated post marketing. Currently, MLD is not included in a postnatal screening programme. Therefore, 
pre-symptomatic patients are only identified if there is an affected sibling. The majority of new MLD subjects 
will be symptomatic. 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 146/157
 
 
The indication proposed by the applicant is largely agreed and includes pre-symptomatic LI-MLD and EJ-MLD 
and a description of early symptomatic MLD EJ-MLD. However, for clarity, it has been specified that patients 
should only have early clinical manifestations of disease. 
Importantly, Reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC is made as this section includes a more elaborate 
description of the MLD subvariants, and the definition of early symptomatic. 
The data suggests that in early symptomatic EJ MLD the cognitive function appears to be preserved when 
treated before the onset of cognitive decline. Thus, treatment may be beneficial to preserve cognitive 
function, while the effect on deterioration of motor function may be limited to a decline in rate of 
deterioration. This information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC as well as treatment of 
symptomatic LI appears not effective as deterioration in line with normal disease progression is observed.  
To allow more rapid treatment of patients, the applicant initially proposed to use a 2-stage release testing 
strategy, in which product identity (presence of transgene) and potency would not be confirmed to 
administration. 
After evaluation of the available data, it was concluded that it is not justified to maintain the 2-stage release 
strategy as this is accompanied by a risk of administering a sub-potent medicinal product which may lead to 
a suboptimal treatment effect, and that retreatment with a new batch is not possible for the patient.  The 
change to a conventional (1-stage) release strategy will, however, result in a 3-4 week longer time interval 
between screening and treatment compared to the clinical studies. Even if the risk of deterioration of the 
patient’s clinical status between screening and treatment because of this delay could be low, it is preferable 
to treat the patients as early as possible. Therefore, the applicant is required to reduce the time from 
screening to treatment towards the ranges used during clinical development within 1 year following approval. 
Reduction of the time needed for product testing and batch release should be part of the measures to achieve 
this.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
In general, unfavourable effects reported in the clinical development programme were attributed by the 
applicant to 3 categories: related to the busulfan conditioning regimen, related to Libmeldy, and related to 
MLD.
Grade ≥ 3 or higher and other serious adverse events reported were most frequently attributed to either the 
busulfan conditioning regimen or the underlying arylsulfatase deficiency. All grade ≥3 infections occurring 
within the first 3 months resolved and none was reported as SAE.
In the 3-month post gene therapy phase, the most commonly occurring adverse events were attributable to 
busulfan conditioning and consisted of: febrile neutropenia (79%), stomatitis (41%) and mucosal 
inflammation (34%). 
In the subsequent treatment phases (short and long term) adverse events related to MLD are most often 
reported: gait disturbance (31%), motor dysfunction (24%), muscle spasticity (31%), ataxia (10%), aphasia 
(14%), dysarthria (14%) and dysphagia (10%).
The only adverse event reported as related to Libmeldy treatment is the presence of anti-ARSA antibodies 
(AAAs), which were detected in 4 subjects from the expanded access programme. For one subject the AAAs 
resolved spontaneously, whereas three subjects required treatment with rituximab. Two additional events 
were identified in May 2020: one new case in study 205756 and one case of re-emergence.

Based on the type of product replication competent lentivirus (RCL) and insertional oncogenesis are 
theoretical safety concerns. There were no confirmed positive results for replication competent lentivirus. In 
addition, there was no sign of clonal dominance or clonal proliferation from insertion site analyses. 
Furthermore, no malignancies were reported during the long term follow up after treatment with Libmeldy.
Three deaths occurred in the clinical development programme. Two subjects died from disease progression 
and are regarded as treatment failures. One subject died due to an ischemic cerebral infarction a year after 
gene therapy. A relationship between the event and gene therapy appears unlikely. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
The number of patients in the Libmeldy safety set is limited. However, the profile seems consistent with the 
known safety profile of autologous HSCT and busulfan conditioning. Thus, the small patient population does 
not present an issue for understanding the safety profile of Libmeldy treatment. 
The current median follow-up duration of Libmeldy is approximately 3 years, ranging from 1 to 7 years. This 
is insufficient to allow for evaluation of the long-term safety of Libmeldy and the busulfan conditioning 
regimen, in particular for the development of malignancies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The effect of Libmeldy in the pre-symptomatic LI-MLD and pre-symptomatic EJ-MLD is impressive as 
performance for both motor and cognitive function remains within the normal range of healthy subjects. It is 
likely that ARSA activity levels need to be maintained above a certain threshold for efficacy. However, the 
exact level or range of this threshold could not be determined by the applicant. Importantly, a fluctuation in 
ARSA activity levels in the CSF is observed with a decrease at the end of the follow up for some subjects. The 
applicant speculated that this could be due to an increase in total CSF proteins, however this could not be 
verified. This raises concern on regarding the maintenance of ARSA activity levels in the CSF in time at levels 
where functional effect can be expected, therefore longer-term follow-up data will be required to establish 
persistence of a treatment effect over a prolonged period of time. 
Importantly, patient identification is an issue as Libmeldy shows an impressive effect in pre-symptomatic LI 
MLD and EJ MLD subjects, and treatment effect is less when patients have become symptomatic and seems 
to be limited or even lost when patients already show signs of cognitive impairment and/or significant 
walking disabilities at the time of treatment. In the absence of a screening programme and no clear 
classification of the MLD variants (i.e. LI-MLD, EJ-MLD and LJ-MLD), it is not clear how pre-symptomatic MLD 
patients, with no symptomatic sibling already diagnosed with MLD, may be identified for treatment.
As patients may benefit from rapid treatment, the applicant initially proposed to use a 2-stage release testing 
strategy, in which product identity (presence of transgene) and potency would not be confirmed to 
administration. As such a strategy can only be accepted under exceptional circumstances, this was subject of 
extensive discussion. After evaluation of the available data, the CAT concluded that it is not justified to 
maintain the 2-stage release strategy, as the 3-4-weeks difference in treatment onset compared to a 
conventional (1-stage) release strategy is unlikely to impact the benefit-risk of the product, as disease 
progression is still relatively slow (progression from GMFC-MLD level 1 to level 2 in the EJ-MLD population is 
1.1 years (10% quartile-90% quartile: 0.34-3.7)). The change to a conventional (1-stage) release strategy 
will, however, result in a 3-4 weeks longer time interval between screening and treatment compared to the 
clinical studies. The MAH was therefore requested, to take measures to reduce the overall time from patient 
screening to treatment to within the ranges observed during clinical development (median 8.2 weeks; range 
6-12.4 weeks). Reduction of the time needed for product testing and release should be part of these 
measures.  
Sufficient data are provided to support the changes to the manufacturing process during development, 
including the change to a cryopreserved formulation and the use of mPB as starting material in addition to 
BM. The observed differences could not be linked to differences in manufacturing procedure and/or are not 
expected to result in differences in clinical outcome. However, considerable batch-to-batch variability is 
observed in VCN and the relatively high percentage of cells with VCN > 10 in some DP batches could give rise 
to a concern with respect to safety and sustained efficacy. It is therefore considered important to continue 
analyzing the circulating cells (and their VCN) in the patients. The applicant has committed to further analyze 
this data. The applicant confirmed that re-evaluation of the DP specifications as part of the annual product 
review will also take into account the clinical outcome data.
The number of patients in the Libmeldy safety set is limited, and interpretation is hampered by uncertainties. 
However, the safety profile of Libmeldy in the immediate phases largely resembles from what is expected of 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 151/157
 
 
HSCT procedures with busulfan conditioning, which is reassuring. In the subsequent long term follow up 
phases, more events are reported that are associated with MLD.
While, the engraftment of transduced HSCP was successful in all subjects, it appears that on a group level 
the engraftment was more successful in subjects with the LI variant, compared to the EJ variant. The cause 
for this difference is unknown. 
The assessment of the long-term safety of Libmeldy treatment, particularly for the development of 
malignancies, is hampered by the limited safety follow up (median: 4.51 years (range: 0.64 to 8.85 years). 
For gene therapies with genome editing properties, the safety and efficacy follow-up should be 15 years. A 
post-authorisation study has been proposed to address this issue and to increase patient numbers, however 
no formal assessment can be performed as no draft protocol has been submitted. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
While an impressive effect is observed in the pre-symptomatic LI-MLD and pre-symptomatic EJ –MLD 
subjects, efficacy, the magnitude of effect in symptomatic EJ-MLD subjects is less evident and more varied. 
The data on motor function in all symptomatic EJ MLD subjects indicate a deterioration albeit at a possibly 
somewhat slower rate of decline than untreated subjects, whereas cognitive function seem to be maintained. 
This observation is in line with the disease process of EJ MLD, which starts with loss of motor function 
followed by cognitive function. It is therefore concluded that for the early symptomatic EJ MLD population the 
window of opportunity to benefit from treatment is not immediately lost upon presentation of symptoms. 
Taking these results into consideration, it is concluded that in children with the early juvenile form, with early 
clinical manifestations of the disease, treatment should only be initiated if the patient has the ability to walk 
independently (the patient’s GMFC-MLD score is ≤ 1), and before the onset of cognitive decline (patient’s IQ 
is ≥ 85.) These requirements are reflected in the indication and the product information and will be regularly 
evaluated and adjusted, if needed, based on data from ongoing and planned post-authorisation safety and 
efficacy studies.
Based on the considerable batch-to-batch variability in VCN and the concern with respect to safety and 
sustained efficacy associated with the relatively high percentage of cells with VCN > 10 it is considered 
important to continue analysing the circulating cells (and their VCN) in the patients. This will be part of the 
study (see comments below). 
In addition, as patients will benefit from rapid treatment, the applicant committed to reduce the time needed 
between screening and treatment by, amongst others, the introduction of a rapid potency assay.
The safety of Libmeldy so far is as expected for a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy including 
myeloablation. 
Uncertainties remain regarding the long-term safety and the presence of anti-ARSA antibodies, but these 
could be potentially overruled by the efficacy from the pre-symptomatic LI and EJ subjects and early 
symptomatic EJ subjects. 
In light of the small study population studied and limited follow-up duration, a post-authorisation efficacy and 
safety study, according to an agreed protocol will continue to monitor and evaluate the maintenance of 
efficacy and the long-term safety of Libmeldy for up to 15 years post treatment. It is considered necessary to 
obtain this in both already treated as well as newly treated patients in order to generate a sufficient database 
that allows conclusions in this orphan population. This in particular applies to motor-function development, 
cognitive performance of patients as well as occurrence of secondary malignancies. In addition, a number of 
EMA/584450/2020
Page 152/157
 
 
planned and on-going post-authorisation studies will monitor safety concerns of delayed platelet engraftment, 
malignancy due to insertional oncogenesis, Anti-ARSA antibodies, engraftment failure, off-label use in other 
MLD subgroups and in general, long-term safety and efficacy data. 
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Libmeldy is positive.
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above. 
4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Libmeldy is favourable in the following indication:
Libmeldy is indicated for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterised by biallelic 
mutations in the arysulfatase A (ARSA) gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic activity:


in children with late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease,
in children with the early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still 
have the ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline.
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the conditions 
specified below.
Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP also considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Libmeldy is favourable in the above 
indication.

New Active Substance Status
Based on the CAT review of the available data, the CAT considers that autologous CD34+ cell enriched 
population that contains haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector 
encoding the human arylsulfatase A gene is a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the new active substance status claim.

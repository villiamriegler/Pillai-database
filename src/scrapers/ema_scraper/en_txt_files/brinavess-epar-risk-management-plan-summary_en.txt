Summary  of  risk  management  plan  for  BRINAVESS  (vernakalant 
hydrochloride) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  RMP  for  BRINAVESS.  The  RMP  details  important  risks  of 
BRINAVESS, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about BRINAVESS’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
BRINAVESS’s  SmPC  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential  information  to  HCPs  and 
patients on how BRINAVESS should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  BRINAVESS  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
BRINAVESS’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
BRINAVESS is authorised for rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation to SR in adults 
for non-surgery patients with atrial fibrillation ≤ 7 days duration and for post-cardiac surgery 
patients with atrial fibrillation ≤ 3 days duration. It contains vernakalant hydrochloride as the 
active substance and it is given by concentrate for solution for infusion, 20 mg/ml. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  BRINAVESS’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
BRINAVESS’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks 
Important  risks  of  BRINAVESS,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about BRINAVESS’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  BRINAVESS,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about ADRs is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  
BRINAVESS is not widely prescribed and used only in an hospital setting by well qualified 
HCPs  with  continuous  monitoring.  These  measures  constitute  routine  pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of BRINAVESS is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  BRINAVESS  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to 
further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely 
administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of BRINAVESS. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

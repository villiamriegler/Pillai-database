2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
There are more than 35 million people worldwide living with HIV. While advances in the development of 
new  antiretroviral  therapies  (ART)  provide  extensive  insights  into  the  management  of  Human 
immunodeficiency  (HIV)-infected  individuals,  chronic  HIV  infection  continues  to  be  characterised  by 
increased  development  of  resistant  virus,  increasing  transmission  of  resistant  virus,  and  issues 
associated with long term toxicity of ART. The current paradigm in the treatment of HIV involves life-
long therapy with multiple antiretrovirals. This dependency on medical therapy requires that we continue 
to improve on the durability, safety and tolerability, and convenience of all antiretroviral classes.  
Standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  uses  combination  of  antiretrovirals  (ARV)  to 
suppress viral replication to below detectable limits, allow CD4 cell counts to increase, and stop disease 
progression.  For  ART-naive  HIV-infected  patients,  current  treatment  guidelines  suggest  that  initial 
therapy consists of 2 NRTIs and either 1 PI, 1 NNRTI or 1 INI.  
Virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients may switch from their current regimen because of safety 
or tolerability concerns or for regimen simplification in order to improve compliance and quality of life. 
Thereupon,  total  pill  burden,  dosing  frequency,  and  safety  concerns  are  the  greatest  obstacles  to 
achieving  adherence,  which  is  essential  to  maintain  viral  suppression  and  prevent  emergence  of 
resistance mutations. 
Various  approaches  to  simplify  a  patient's  antiretroviral  therapy  regimen,  after  achieving  virologic 
suppression,  have  been  studied,  notably  by  reducing  the  number  of  ARVs.  Several  bitherapies  had 
demonstrated their non-inferiority to maintain virologic suppression in comparison to usual tritherapies, 
and some of them have even been marketed (RPV/DTG – Juluca; DTG/3TC – Dovato). New formulations 
reducing pill burden and improving compliance are welcome. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant seeks the following therapeutic indication for Vocabria (cabotegravir): 
Vocabria injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, for the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
<50 copies/mL) and have no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. 
2.1.2.  Biologic features, clinical presentation and diagnosis.  
HIV-1 infection results in chronic activation of the immune system and a subsequent gradual loss of 
CD4+ T cells eventually leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors 
for HIV-1 disease progression is the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (i.e. viral load). The aim of 
treatment of HIV-1 infection is therefore to suppress, and subsequently maintain, the HIV-1 viral load 
to levels that are at least below the limit of detection of most commonly used assays (50 copies/ml of 
blood) and therefore the preservation of the immune system. 
Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms 
(including fever, rash, or diarrhoea), or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, 
these generally emerge approximately 2 weeks following HIV infection. Among those presenting with 
symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 12/140 
 
 
 
Diagnosis, therefore, most often occurs during chronic infection. In some settings, up to half of the 
people present to care with advanced HIV disease – defined by WHO as having a CD4 cell count <200 
cells/mm3 or a WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease. Leading causes of mortality among adults with 
advanced HIV disease globally include tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal 
meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
Following HIV diagnosis, the initial laboratory workup includes assessment of HIV staging parameters 
(CD4 cell count, HIV RNA) as well as an HIV genotype test for detection of drug resistance. The 
spectrum of drug resistance in an individual patient can range from minimal resistance that affects the 
activity of one or two drugs, to multidrug resistance that includes resistance to several drug classes. 
However, the risk of developing multidrug-resistant virus is much lower than in the past due to simpler 
regimens that better tolerated.  
2.1.3.  Management 
According to EU HIV treatment guidelines, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended in all patients 
with HIV infection, irrespective of CD4 cell counts. The main goal of ART is to suppress viral replication 
to below detectable limits (<50 c/ml), increase CD4+ cell counts, and prevent transmission. It is a life-
long treatment, as the viral load will rebound as soon as an individual stop taking effective 
antiretroviral therapy. 
Current treatment options are generally considered to be potent, with an overall acceptable toxicity 
profile. Mutations in the viral genome can, however, occur when the virus replicates, which can make 
the virus resistant to antiretroviral drugs or classes of drugs. Therefore, there is a continued need for 
development of new antiretroviral treatment options. 
About the product 
Cabotegravir (CAB) is a new active substance; an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI) that has 
been developed by ViiV Healthcare. CAB possesses attributes that allow formulation and delivery as a 
long-acting (LA) parenteral product (prolonged-release suspension for injection). 
ViiV Healthcare, in partnership with Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (Janssen), are developing a two-drug 
regimen for the treatment of HIV-1, consisting of concomitant but separate administration of CAB 
prolonged-release suspension for injection and rilpivirine (RPV) prolonged-release suspension for 
injection.  
CAB + RPV is intended for use as a 2-drug long acting (LA) regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
According to the applicant, such a regimen offers reduced dosing frequency (monthly) compared with 
daily oral ARVs. With less frequent dosing, the daily reminder of their HIV status may be avoided, and 
associated stigma related to taking oral treatment regimens may be lessened. A reduced dosing schedule 
holds promise for increased patient compliance with dosing requirements. This novel treatment option 
may result in improved overall satisfaction with treatment and longer retention in care for individuals 
with  HIV  infection.  This  NRTI-sparing  regimen  avoids  exposure  to  this  class  of  ART  thereby  avoiding 
possible  NRTI-class-related  resistance,  and  longer  term  NRTI-related  toxicities.  Given  the  parenteral 
route  of  administration,  a  2-drug  LA  injectable  regimen  may  result  in  fewer  gastrointestinal  adverse 
events, eliminate dosing restrictions with regard to food, and will have fewer drug-drug interactions at 
the level of the gastrointestinal tract.  
This application focuses on the CAB component of this 2-drug regimen. RPV is owned by Janssen and 
will be the subject of a separate marketing application.

CAB  is  a  novel  INI  that  possesses  attributes  that  allow  formulation  and  delivery  as  an  LA  parenteral 
product  for  IM  administration.  An oral  tablet  formulation  of  CAB  has  also  been  developed  and  will  be 
used in combination with oral RPV as part of a 1-month oral lead-in (OLI) before LA therapy is initiated, 
in order to assess the tolerability and safety of this bitherapy before starting the LA injections.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Cabotegravir 
General information 
The chemical name of cabotegravir is (3S,11aR)-N-[(2,4-Difluorophenyl)methyl]-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-
5,7-dioxo-2,3,5,7,11,11a-hexahydro[1,3]oxazolo[3,2-a]pyrido[1,2-d]pyrazine-8-carboxamide. It

corresponds to the molecular formula C19H17F2N3O5, its relative molecular mass is 405.35 and it has 
the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Structure of cabotegravir 
Cabotegravir appears as a white to almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid hygroscopic powder. 
It is practically insoluble below pH 9 and slightly soluble above pH 10 in aqueous media. It has two 
pKa, pKa1 = 7.7 (measured), OH group and pKa2 =11.1 (calculated), NH group. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectrometry, mass spectrometry (MS), IR spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray 
crystallography. 
Cabotegravir possesses two stereogenic centres and is the isomer with the 3S, 11aR configuration.  
The 3S and the 11aR configuration are derived are determined either by starting materials or by the 
synthetic process. The absolute stereochemistry of the active substance is confirmed by single crystal 
X-ray crystallography. 
Cabotegravir exhibits polymorphism and four solid state forms have been identified, of which only two 
are relevant to the commercial manufacturing process: Form 1 and Form 2. Form 1 was confirmed as 
the most thermodynamically stable form at ambient conditions and under process relevant conditions. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance manufacturer has been stated. Cabotegravir manufacturing process consists of 6 
steps including a purification step from well-defined starting materials (SMs). These SMs have been 
sufficiently justified in line with ICH Q11 and are controlled by suitable specifications. There are three 
isolated intermediates controlled by acceptable specifications. The stereochemistry of cabotegravir is 
determined either by the starting materials or by the process conditions of the synthetic process. 
A systematic, science and risk-based approach has been applied in evaluating, understanding and 
improving the manufacturing process for cabotegravir consistent with ICH Q11 for the development 
and manufacture of active substance. The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was clearly presented. 
Based on the QTPP, the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the active substance have been identified 
and presented. Based on the CQAs for the active substance, every stage of the manufacturing process 
has been evaluated and optimised by a quality by design (QbD) approach and the use of Design of 
experiments (DoE). Design spaces, supported by multivariate experimentation, have been defined for 
all stages of the commercial manufacturing process. In combination with the input specifications, the 
design spaces represent the control strategy for cabotegravir. Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and 
their target values or ranges are identified, as well as non-critical process parameters. Design spaces, 
supported by multivariate experimentation, have been defined and clearly presented for certain steps 
of the process. The CPP ranges are within the ranges studied in the DoEs.  
Sufficient information was presented for the verification of the proposed DSs to the commercial scale.  
The history of manufacturing process development was presented, and the impact of the final AS 
quality was adequately discussed and shown comparable.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. Rationale for impurity specifications in starting materials and 
intermediates is based on fate and purge studies.  
The active substance packaging materials has been described. The materials comply with EU 
Commission Regulation No 10/2011 for food contact use and the compositional requirements of Ph. 
Eur. Section 3.1.3 Polyolefins. The antistatic additive used in the manufacture of the bags is not listed 
under Ph. Eur. 3.1.3. However, the manufactured bag material has been tested to, and found to 
comply with the test requirements of Ph. Eur. 3.1.3. 
Specification 
Cabotegravir active substance specification, includes appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), identification (IR), solid state form (XRPD), cabotegravir content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
enantiomer content (chiral HPLC), diastereomer content (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and bioburden (Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed specification is acceptable; the proposed limits are in line with the relevant European 
guidelines and the provided batch analyses. The limits for specified and unspecified impurities comply 
to ICH Q3B and for residual solvents to Q3C and are justified through fate and purge studies. The 
provided justification for the parameters included in the specification and those parameters not 
included in the specification is acceptable. The control strategy for the residual solvents is satisfactory. 
There are two mutagenic impurities identified during development which have the potential to be 
present in active substance. Based on batch data, these mutagenic impurities would not be present in 
active substance above 30% of the TTC-based acceptable limit of 16 µg/g. Consequently, neither of 
these mutagenic impurities require ICH M7 Option 1 control and therefore they are not included on the 
active substance specification. A risk assessment according to ICH Q3D has been conducted and the 
proposed controls for elemental impurities is justified.  
The analytical procedures have been sufficiently described. Non-compendial analytical methods have 
been successful validated according to ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data were provided for three production-scale batches of cabotegravir, which were 
manufactured according to the proposed commercial method at the commercial site and tested by the 
proposed commercial methods. In addition, data from an additional 17 batches of cabotegravir, 
manufactured using a process representative of that intended for commercial manufacture and 
produced at the commercial site of manufacture have been provided. These batches are representative 
of the quality of the active substance that was used in clinical trials and include primary stability 
batches. Batches were tested by the proposed commercial methods or validated clinical release 
methods. All batches complied with the proposed specification. 
Stability 
Stability data have been provided for four pilot scale batches stored at long term conditions 30°/75% 
RH for up to 24 months and at accelerated conditions 40°C/75% RH for 6 months. Although a higher 
humidity was used for the long-term stability studies at 30 °C, than required according to ICH 
Q1A(R2), no objection is made as the higher humidity is seen as more stressful (worst case). The 
batches were stored in the commercial packaging. Samples from one batch were also stored at 5 ± 
3°C and 50°C, both without humidity control.  
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 16/140 
 
 
 
Stability batches were tested for description, assay, impurities, water content, solid state, 
diastereomer and enantiomer content. The methods are the same used for release except for the 
method for the determination of enantiomer content. The different method for enantiomer content has 
been described and fully validated and was shown to be equivalent to the method used for release 
testing. 
No trends were observed in any of the provided stability batches under any of the stability conditions. 
Although control of the storage temperature is not required, as the proposed storage condition “Store 
up to 30°C” is acceptable since, in general, it will not require any special measures for storage. 
In addition to ICH stability studies, stress studies (50°C, 40°C/75%RH exposed, photostability, and 
freeze-thaw cycles) were performed for one pilot batch over one months. Photostability was conducted 
on a pilot batch, according to ICH Q1B. No significant changes were observed and the he results 
demonstrate chemical and physical stability of cabotegravir under these storage conditions. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed on cabotegravir to identify potential degradation 
products. Cabotegravir was chemically stable in the solid state under all stressing conditions used in 
the forced degradation study. There was no significant increase in the total degradation products under 
any solid-state stress condition. Significant degradation was only observed in solution under acidic, 
basic and oxidative conditions. However, the degradation pathways observed under solution phase 
conditions are formed under forcing conditions that are not representative of those that a solid active 
substance will experience during manufacture or storage. The results from the forced degradation 
studies demonstrate that the HPLC methods are stability indicating. 
Based on the available stability data the proposed retest period of 36 months with storage condition 
“Store up to 30°C” is acceptable. 
Cabotegravir sodium 
General information 
The chemical name of cabotegravir sodium is sodium (3S,11aR)-N-[(2,4-Difluorophenyl)methyl]-6-
hydroxy-3-methyl-5,7-dioxo-2,3,5,7,11,11a-hexahydro[1,3]oxazolo[3,2-a]pyrido[1,2-d]pyrazine-8-
carboxamide. It corresponds to the molecular formula C19H16F2N3NaO5, its relative molecular mass is 
427.33 and it has the structure shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Structure of cabotegravir sodium 
Cabotegravir sodium appears as a white to almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid hygroscopic 
powder. It is practically insoluble below pH 9 and slightly soluble above pH 10 in aqueous media. It has 
two pKa, pKa1 = 7.8 (measured), OH group and pKa2 =11.1 (calculated), NH group. Its partition 
coefficient is 1.1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 17/140 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectrometry, mass spectrometry (MS), IR spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectroscopy (ICP-OES), elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
Cabotegravir sodium possesses two stereogenic centres and is the isomer with the 3S, 11aR 
configuration.  The 3S and the 11aR configuration are derived are determined either by starting 
materials or by the synthetic process. The absolute stereochemistry of the active substance is 
confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
It exhibits polymorphism; two solid state forms that are relevant to the commercial manufacturing 
process have been identified, Form 4 and Form 3. Form 4 was confirmed as the most 
thermodynamically stable form at ambient conditions and under process relevant conditions. Solid 
state form is not impacted by micronisation.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance manufacturer has been stated. Cabotegravir sodium is produced from 
cabotegravir free acid as described above with an additional 5th stage to transform the ‘free acid’ to the 
sodium salt, the same starting materials are used. Non-micronised cabotegravir sodium and the final 
active substance, cabotegravir sodium (micronised), packaging material has been described. These are 
the same packaging materials as used for cabotegravir (see above). 
Specification 
Cabotegravir sodium active substance specification, includes appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), identification (IR), solid state form (XRPD), cabotegravir sodium content (HPLC), sodium 
content (ICP-OES), impurities (HPLC), enantiomer content (chiral HPLC), diastereomer content (chiral 
HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The proposed specification is acceptable; the proposed limits are in line with the relevant European 
guidelines and the provided batch analyses. The limits for specified and unspecified impurities comply 
to ICH Q3B and for residual solvents to Q3C and are justified through fate and purge studies. The 
control strategy for the residual solvents and microbiological quality is satisfactory. 
The analytical procedures have been sufficiently described. Non-compendial analytical methods have 
been successful validated according to ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data were provided for three full scale and five pilot batches of cabotegravir sodium 
micronised, which were manufactured according to the proposed commercial method by the proposed 
manufacturer and micronised at each of the three commercial micronisation sites. In addition, data 
from another 4 batches of cabotegravir sodium (micronised), manufactured using a process 
representative of that intended for commercial manufacture and synthesised at the commercial site of 
manufacture have been provided. These batches are representative of the quality of the active 
substance that was used in clinical trials and includes batches used to manufacture Cabotegravir 
Tablets used in Phase 3 clinical and primary stability studies. Batches were tested by the proposed 
commercial methods or validated clinical release methods. All batches complied with the proposed 
specification 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020

Stability 
Stability data for cabotegravir sodium micronised have been provided for five pilot scale batches stored 
at long term conditions 30 °C / 75% RH for up to 24 months and 40 °C / 75% RH for 6 months. The 
batches were stored in the intended commercial packaging. One batch of micronised material was also 
stored at 5 ± 3 °C and 50 °C, both without humidity control. In addition, one pilot batch of non-
micronised material was also stored at 30 °C / 75% RH (24 months), 40°C/75% RH (6 months), 5 ± 
3°C and 50°C, in the latter two without humidity control. Although a higher humidity was used for the 
long-term stability studies at 30°C, than required according to ICH Q1A, no objection is made as the 
higher humidity is seen as more stringent condition. 
Stability batches were tested for description, assay, impurities, enantiomer and diastereomer content, 
water content (non-micronised cabotegravir sodium only), particle size (tested for information only for 
non-micronised cabotegravir sodium) and solid-state form. The used methods are the same as for 
release except for the methods for the determination of enantiomer content and impurities. These 
different methods have been described and fully validated and were shown to be equivalent to the 
methods used for release. No significant change neither any trends were observed under any of the 
storage conditions. A photostability study was conducted, according to ICH Q1B, on two pilot batches 
of cabotegravir sodium (one micronised and one non-micronised). Based on the provided results from 
photostability studies, according to ICH Q1B, cabotegravir sodium requires protection from light, 
therefore, for cabotegravir sodium the storage condition “protect from light” has been set. 
A freeze/thaw study was also performed in which samples were stored for two repeated cycles 
consisting of 7 days at -20°C followed by 7 days at 30°C, for a total of 1-month exposure. No 
significant changes were observed and the he results demonstrate chemical and physical stability of 
cabotegravir under these storage conditions. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed on cabotegravir and cabotegravir sodium to identify 
potential degradation products that might be formed in active substance. Cabotegravir was chemically 
stable in the solid state under all stressing conditions used in the forced degradation study. There was 
no significant increase in the total degradation products under any solid-state stress conditions. 
Significant degradation was only observed in solution under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions. 
However, the degradation pathways observed under solution phase conditions are formed under 
forcing conditions that are not representative of those that a solid active substance will experience 
during manufacture or storage. 
The results from the forced degradation studies demonstrate that the combination of HPLC methods 
are stability indicating, for both active substances. The results from the forced degradation studies 
demonstrate that the HPLC methods are stability indicating. 
Based on the available stability data the proposed retest period of 36 months with storage conditions 
“Store up to 30°C” and “protect from light” is acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Prolonged-release suspension for injection 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a prolonged release suspension for injection containing 200 mg/mL 
cabotegravir free acid, intended for intramuscular (IM) injection. It is a white to light pink, free flowing 
suspension. 
Each sterile, single-use vial of cabotegravir injectable suspension is intended to provide a dose of 400 
mg or 600 mg. No dilution is required prior to IM administration. The two strengths are differentiated 
by labelling and plastic cap colors; the 2 ml fill presentation has a dark gray cap and the 3 ml fill 
presentation has an orange cap. 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was a suspension for injection, for long-acting drug 
delivery, stable, easily redispersible, at a sufficient drug load to minimise injection volume for 
intramuscular administration.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) and CQA of the finished product have been established and 
discussed. Cabotegravir free acid was chosen due to its low aqueous solubility in order to achieve 
desired pharmacokinetic performance. Cabotegravir free acid low aqueous solubility, long systemic 
half-life and the controlled particle size of the suspension allow for a finished product with long-acting 
drug delivery and permit high drug loading, which in turn minimises injection volume required to 
achieve desired dose.  
The formulation development studies to ensure the desired finished product attributes were described. 
The same formulation (formulation A), has been used for phase 2 and 3 studies and represents the 
commercial formulation. The in-process specifications for PSD are in-line with bioavailability study and 
clinical batches. The presence of small orange-coloured regions was observed in a small number of 
vials. The cause of these orange-coloured regions has been identified as a transient solution species 
and therefore will be present across a product batch. The clinical batches (using the same formulation) 
did not have any efficacy or safety issue linked to this and thus it is accepted that it does not pose a 
safety or efficacy concern.  
All chosen excipients are widely used in parenteral products and the levels chosen for this product are 
within typical ranges used for suspensions. The function of the chosen excipients has been adequately 
discussed. There are no novel excipients. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The development of dissolution method has been elaborated and justified. The development of the 
manufacturing process is discussed in detail for each process stage, the resulting manufacturing 
process parameters and control strategy are adequately discussed and justified. The manufacturing 
process applied for clinical batches has also been discussed; some slight differences with the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process are not expected to result in critical quality differences between 
batches of finished product. Supplies for the last clinical studies were produced at the same site as 
proposed for commercial production, but with a different gamma irradiation site.  
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 20/140 
 
 
 
The control strategy has been developed based on risk assessment and process knowledge and the 
CQA of finished product are ensured through attributes of the input materials, parameters of the 
manufacturing process, in-process controls, and finished product specification. 
The manufacturing process consists of gamma irradiation of the active substance, compounding of 
formulation vehicle, compounding of bulk suspension by milling, filling into vials, and terminal 
sterilisation. Microbial control of the finished product occurs at various stages of the process. The 
manufacturing process development is described in relation to the impact of process parameters and 
in-process controls to the finished product CQAs.  
Studies to define and confirm the ranges of PPs, CPPs and IPCs were conducted for the different steps 
of the process i.e. compounding of bulk suspension for milling, milling, and transfer to filling tank. It 
has been demonstrated that the process has no impact on the solid-state polymorph (Form 1). The 
proposed in-process particle size specification is based on the data for clinical and stability batches at 
the production scale batch size. The fill weight has been determined so that the target extractable 
volume and pH of the solution are achieved. The gamma irradiation dose applied for the terminal 
sterilisation is justified. The selection of terminal sterilisation by irradiation versus steam sterilisation 
has been justified.  
For both strengths, one single-use vial of Cabotegravir prolonged-release suspension for injection is 
packaged with the following aspiration and dosing devices: one sterile, single-use vial adaptor, one 5-
mL sterile, single-use syringe and one sterile, single-use 23 gauge, 1.5-inch safety needle. 
Compatibility with the primary packaging components with the finished product and the manufacturing 
process (gamma irradiation) and closure integrity have been demonstrated. CE-certificates issued by 
notified bodies are submitted for all medical devices delivered with the finished product. Compatibility 
of the medical devices with Finished product during the proposed in-use stability of two hours at room 
temperature has been demonstrated. The product is into Type I clear glass vials and sealed with 
bromobutyl rubber stoppers in two nominal fill presentations, 2ml and 3 ml for the 400 and 600 mg 
strength respectively. The stopper is secured with an aluminium overseal with a removable plastic cap. 
The specifications for vial and stopper are presented.  The supplier has confirmed that the rubber 
stopper is not made with natural rubber latex and that they comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. 
3.2.9. The vials comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1. Extractables and leachables studies have been conducted 
and demonstrated that the leachables potentially present in the cabotegravir suspension, after long-
term storage (up to 12 months) do not pose a risk to the patient. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturer of finished product has been stated. 
The manufacturing process is described with process parameters and IPCs and consists of: sterilisation 
of cabotegravir active substance by gamma irradiation, compounding of formulation vehicle, 
compounding of cabotegravir bulk suspension, milling of the suspension with 3mm milling beads, filling 
into vials, stoppering and over-sealing, terminal sterilisation by gamma irradiation, and vials 
inspection. The manufacturing process is a non-standard one. The critical in process controls were 
identified and justified. 
Product sterility and bacterial endotoxins of the finished product are assured by controls on the 
excipients, active substance, primary packaging components, the manufacturing process (including 
gamma irradiation of active substance prior to compounding, use of suitable manufacturing equipment 
and manufacturing processing environment), terminal sterilisation, and in-process and finished product 
testing.  The claim for parametric release for sterility has been sufficiently supported and is accepted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 21/140 
 
 
 
Process validation has been adequately performed in line with the relevant guideline on three full scale 
batches of each strength. The report of the validation of the terminal sterilisation process, including 
dose mapping studies, was also provided. Sterility assurance is achieved by means of validation of 
different steps of the process. The sterilisation and depyrogenation processes applied for stoppers, 
vials and beads are fully validated. The process is considered successfully validated and that it is 
adequately under control in order to consistently obtain a product that complies with the specifications.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), cabotegravir 
content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), extractable volume, particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. 
Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction), dissolution (Ph. Eur. , HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specifications are set based on the requirements of Guideline ICH Q6A. The limits for 
impurities are set in line with ICH Q3B and testing frequency is justified. Certain parameters were not 
included in the specifications and this has been justified. The dissolution limit is based on the clinical 
and primary stability batches and is compliant with general compendial requirements. 
A risk assessment on elemental impurities was provided, which substantiates that no control for 
elemental impurities is needed at release of finished product. No elemental impurities were identified 
as having the potential to be present at a level of greater than 30% of the PDE limit for parenteral 
administration, using Option 2b defined in ICH Q3D. 
Risk assessment, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product 
manufacturing process and the active substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine 
impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities 
formation and no risk for cross-contamination with other products. 
For sterility, parametric release is proposed. The justification for parametric release is in accordance to 
the ‘guideline on real time release testing’.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were presented for 10 commercial size batches of the finished product, 
manufactured by the same process proposed for commercial use and at the same site. All results are in 
line with the proposed specifications, confirming robustness of the process. In addition, sufficient 
information about the finished product batches used in clinical studies was provided, for each of the 26 
batches.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 4 commercial scale batches of finished product manufactured at the proposed site 
and stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions at 5 ± 3ºC and at 30 ± 2 °C/ 75 ± 5 % RH 
and under accelerated conditions (40 ± 2ºC / 75 ± 5 % RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Vials were stored in inverted position. As the 2 ml filled vials (400 mg strength) 
have a relative larger head space volume, they are considered at greater stability challenge, therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020

testing  was  performed on three  batches of  400  mg strength  and one  of  600 mg  strength  (3  ml  filled 
vials). 
Samples were tested for description, assay, impurities, particle size, pH, dissolution and sterility (yearly). 
The analytical methods used in the stability studies are the same as for release. In addition, testing also 
included some additional methods (resuspendability and syringeability, evaluation of glass vials, elemental 
impurities) used in freeze-thaw and in-use stability studies. The description of these methods and their 
validation was presented.  
No significant changes were observed in description, cabotegravir content, drug-related impurities, pH, 
and sterility when stored for up to 12 months at 5°C and 30 °C/ 75 % RH. Particle size and dissolution 
also remained unchanged when stored for up to 12 months at 5 °C. An increase in particle size and a 
corresponding decrease in dissolution were observed following storage at 30 °C/ 75 % RH, however the 
results still complied with the specification. 
Under accelerated conditions no significant changes were observed in description, cabotegravir content, 
drug-related impurities, and pH when stored for up to 6 months at 40 °C/ 75 % RH, except for one 
batch, where the assay decreased after 6 months but was still within the specification. Based on a 
statistical analysis of the available results of assay at 30 °C/ 75 % RH (up to 12 months), the applicant 
states that a 24 months shelf life is supported. Similar to long term results, an increase in particle size 
and the expected decrease in dissolution were also observed under accelerated conditions, however the 
results still complied with the specification. 
Stress tests on a full-scale batch of each strength included freeze/thaw cycles and exposure to 50 °C. 
On these batches, in addition to the test mentioned above, glass elements by ICP and microscopic 
evaluation of glass is performed. No significant changes were observed in description, cabotegravir 
content, drug-related impurities or pH when stored for up to 3 months at 50°C. In line with the results 
observed in long term and accelerated condition studies, particle size increase and dissolution decrease 
have been observed after 3 months at 50°C, however the results were still within the specification. The 
freeze-thaw study (-20 °C/ 30 °C) showed that freezing impacts irreversibly the particle size and 
therefore the redispersibility of the suspension, therefore SmPC 6.4 recommends “Do not freeze”.   
A photostability study according to ICH Q1B Option 1 was performed on a full-scale batch of each 
strength; no significant change was observed, confirming that the finished product is photostable. 
In-use stability studies have been performed on samples from two batches of the 400 mg strength and 
one batch from the 600 mg strength. The samples were tested for description, assay, impurities, pH, 
extractable volume, particle size and elemental impurities. No significant change was observed in all 
tested parameters. 
Results of an in-use stability study substantiate the proposed in-use stability of 2 hours for the finished 
product when withdrawn in the provided plastic syringe (SmPC 6.3). 
Based on the overall stability data the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and storage conditions as 
described in SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4 can be accepted. The shelf life and storage conditions of 
suspension in syringe as stated in SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4 are also accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the finished product. The 
excipient Polysorbate 20 is of vegetable origin.

Film coated tablets 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film coated tablet for oral administration, containing 31.62 
mg of cabotegravir sodium (micronised), equivalent to 30 mg of cabotegravir free acid. 
Vocabria  tablets  are  white  film-coated,  oval-shaped  tablets,  (approximately  8.0  mm  by  14.3  mm), 
debossed with “SV CTV” on one side. 
The finished product (FP) is packaged into opaque, white high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with 
a polypropylene child-resistant closure that include a polyethylene faced induction heat seal liner. 
A science and risk-based approach, applying Quality by Design (QbD) and quality risk management 
(QRM) in accordance with ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, has been used to develop Vocabria film-coated tablets. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) has established the desired quality characteristics of the 
finished product. The finished product Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) have been identified and an 
understanding of the impact of the attributes of the active substance, excipients, container closure 
system and in-process materials, as well as the process parameters of the manufacturing process on 
finished product quality has been established. 
The knowledge gained from the pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience have 
provided the scientific understanding to support the control strategy to assure product quality, which 
incorporates target values/set points, PARs, and a design space for the granulation unit operation. 
The active substance for the cabotegravir tablets is the sodium salt of cabotegravir, solid state Form 4, 
and is micronised to meet the QTPP of finished product. Cabotegravir sodium is classified a BCS class 2 
compound (see pK report). The sodium salt has higher solubility than the free acid form ensuring oral 
bioavailability and appropriate pharmacokinetics. The solid-state form 4 is the most thermodynamically 
stable. Particle size distribution (PSD) was studied in a human pharmacokinetics study that showed 
that micronised cabotegravir sodium gave an increased AUC and Cmax when compared to non-
micronised substance. The PSD of cabotegravir sodium has been confirmed as an active substance 
CQA and ensures that dissolution profile is met. It is well controlled by the micronisation process for 
the active substance and is tested in the AS specification. Comparative dissolution profiles are obtained 
regardless of micronisation site. 
All chosen excipients are widely used in solid oral products and the levels chosen for this product are 
within typical ranges used for tablets in view of the functions stated in the composition table. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The choice of AS crystal form, particle size 
limits, the excipients, their functions and quantity were sufficiently justified and explained.  
The development of the formulae used for clinical studies was described. Design of experiments (DoE) 
studies were performed in order to select the formulation responding to the QTPP profile. The DoE 
outcome determined the levels of the binder, disintegrant and drug load. The formula used in phase 2b 
studies had low solubility; a bio-equivalent formula has been developed for phase 3 studies and was 
used in all phase 3 studies, including pivotal studies, in stability studies and is the commercial formula.  
The development of the dissolution method has been well described. A DoE study was performed for 
the selection of surfactant concentration and rotation speed.  The discriminatory power of the method 
has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
The manufacturing process used for Vocabria film coated tablets consists of dry mixing of intragranular 
excipients with the active substance, high shear wet granulation, wet screening, and fluid bed drying 
Assessment report

followed by dry milling. The film-coated tablets are packaged in HDPE bottles. The selected process 
ensured that the finished product CQAs are met consistently. 
The finished product CQAs and the input materials attributes or process parameters that determine the 
CQA are identified. A risk assessment has been conducted and the relationship between process 
parameters and intermediate CQA and the finished product CQA was established. Process development 
has been conducted at commercial scale. The granulation unit operation has been identified to impact 
the CQAs. Based on the DoE, a design space was established for this step. The classification of process 
parameters as critical and non-critical has been supported and the proposed post authorisation 
management is acceptable. 
Vocabria film coated tablets are packed into opaque, white HDPE bottles with polypropylene child 
resistant closures, with a polyethylene faced induction heat seal liner.  Stability studies confirmed that 
a desiccant in the packaging is not necessary. The HDPE is pigmented white with titanium dioxide. The 
plastic packaging materials components comply with the EU Commission Regulation No. 10/2011 on 
plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food. The HDPE bottles comply with 
Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 Polyolefines.  Acceptable specifications are provided for the bottles and closures as well 
as Certificates of analysis from the suppliers. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturer of Vocabria film coated tablets has been stated. The manufacturing process consists 
of  pre-mix  of  intra-granular  components,  wet  granulation,  screening  and  drying  of  granulate,  milling, 
blending  with  extra-granular  excipients,  lubrication,  compression,  film-coating,  and  packaging.  The 
manufacturing processes is a standard process. A DS is applied to the wet granulation unit operation 
which has been adequately discussed during pharmaceutical development studies. The critical process 
parameters  have  been  identified  and  justified  during  development  have  been  identified  and  justified 
during development.  
Process validation scheme is presented. Process validation of cabotegravir tablets is being performed via 
a  lifecycle  approach,  based  on  a  systematic  and  structured  risk  management  approach,  which 
demonstrates and documents evidence that the process, together with the defined control strategy, is 
capable of reproducibly manufacturing product which meets all of the finished product CQAs. 
The bulk tablets (intermediate) packaging material was described. The packaging material comply with 
the requirements of Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles 
intended to come into contact with food and with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 on Polyolefins. Holding time and 
conditions, and transport are supported by stability data.  
A process validation scheme in line with the Guideline on process validation was presented. According 
to this scheme validation will be performed on three commercial size batches before commercial 
launch. Process validation results from at least one production scale batch have been submitted to 
confirm the robustness of the process. Based on the extensive pharmaceutical development data 
provided and on the nature of the manufacturing process, it is expected that the process will be robust 
within the established parameters.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), cabotegravir 
content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur., UV) and microbiological limit tests (Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 25/140 
 
 
 
The proposed specifications are set based on the requirements of ICH Q6A and Ph. Eur. The 
justifications provided are agreed. The limits for impurities are in line with ICH Q3B. Testing frequency 
has been sufficiently justified. The specifications are sufficiently justified and together with the 
manufacturing process control ensure the finished product quality attributes will be consistently met. 
The control strategy for cabotegravir 30 mg tablets is acceptable. Certain parameters were not 
included in the specifications and this has been justified. 
A risk assessment for elemental impurities has been conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D Option 2b, 
to evaluate the potential for elemental impurities to be present in the finished product and the relevant 
discussion has been provided. No elemental impurities were identified to be present at a level of 
greater than 30% of the PDE limit for oral administration. Based on this, elemental impurities are not 
included in the finished product specification.  
A risk assessment, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product 
manufacturing process and the active substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine 
impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities 
formation and no risk for cross-contamination with other products. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data were presented for 7 production scale batches manufactured according to the 
commercial process and at the commercial site. Results results comply with the specifications 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product manufactured by the proposed 
commercial  process  at  the  proposed  site  and  stored  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term  conditions 
(5ºC, 25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC 
/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These batches were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Stability samples were tested as per the release specifications and test methods. Slight method 
optimisations applied to the method for dissolution and impurities after start of the stability studies. 
These changes were discussed and are not expected to impact the results. Water content is tested in 
the stability studies but not included in the release specifications. Water content is performed 
according to the Karl Fisher method (Ph. Eur. 2.5.32). No significant changes in description, content, 
drug related-impurities, dissolution and microbial limit test were observed, and all results comply with 
specification. A small increase in the water content was observed at accelerated conditions only.  
In addition, stress condition studies have been performed on one full-scale batch at 50ºC/ ambient 
humidity, a freeze/thaw cycle (-20ºC / 30ºC) and exposed photostability testing in accordance with 
ICH Q1B (Option 1). No significant changes in description, content, drug related impurities and 
dissolution were observed. The results demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of the finished 
product at all storage conditions and confirms that the finished product is photostable.  
Forced degradation studies have been performed on one full-scale batch in three conditions: 80°C for 
14 days, 80 °C/ 75% RH for 14 days and after UV-Vis light exposure (ICH Q1B conditions). The 
Assessment report

samples have been tested by the HPLC method for impurities. No increase in degradation products 
above the ICH Q3B limit has been measured and mass balance was always achieved. No significant 
changes in description, assay, impurities, dissolution and water content were observed and all results 
comply with specification.  
In-use stability studies were presented at the initial timepoint and after storage at the long-term 
storage condition for 12 months. The in-use stability studies were performed on one of the primary 
stability batches. No significant changes in description, assay, impurities and dissolution were 
observed. An increase in water content was observed, however this is not associated with any change 
in physical or chemical stability. Based on the EMA Q&A on quality and on the results of the main 
stability study, performance of an in-use stability study was not necessary and therefore the study 
protocol has not been assessed. No indication on in-use stability needs to be included in the SmPC. 
The applicant states that the presented data support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions for 
Cabotegravir Tablets: a shelf-life of 24 months will be applied to the product. No storage condition 
statement is required on the label. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4), is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of Vocabria film coated tablets 
except for lactose monohydrate. The magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin.  
Lactose monohydrate is derived from bovine milk. The suppliers of the lactose confirm that the milk 
used in the manufacture of the lactose is sourced from healthy animals in the same conditions as for 
human consumption. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the 
same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been 
prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for 
Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human 
and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. Cabotegravir free acid was chosen for the prolonged release suspension for 
injection due to its low aqueous solubility in order to achieve desired pharmacokinetic performance. 
Cabotegravir sodium micronised is used in the film coated tablets, in order to enhance solubility and 
therefore ensuring oral bioavailability and appropriate pharmacokinetics. The applicant has applied 
QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and their 
manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the 
active substance and finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified and are 
accepted. The proposed RTRT approach (parametric release for the sterility test) for the suspension for 
injection is accepted. 
The manufacturing process for the prolonged release suspension for injection is non-standard and the 
required validation data has been provided. The manufacturing process for the film coated tablets is a 
standard process.

The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Cabotegravir (CAB, GSK1265744) is a novel, potent and selective HIV Integrase Strand Transfer 
Inhibitor (INSTI) developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  CAB is being developed as the 
sodium salt for oral (tablet) administration and as the free acid for a long acting (LA) injectable 
formulation, to be co-administered with rilpivirine. 
Cabotegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer 
step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. 
Rilpivirine (RPV) is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) treatment for HIV-1 
infection  in  antiretroviral  treatment  naïve  adult  patients  and  is  already  approved  in  multiple  markets 
including the United States of America, Europe, Canada and Japan as EDURANT®. 
Integration of viral DNA into the host chromosome is a necessary process in the HIV replication cycle.  
The key steps of DNA integration are carried out by the viral integrase, which, along with protease and 
reverse transcriptase (RT), is 1 of 3 enzymes encoded by HIV.  Integrase is an attractive target for HIV 
therapy because it is essential for HIV replication. The primary role of integrase is to catalyse the 
insertion of the viral cDNA into the chromosome of infected cells.  Integration, catalysed via integrase, 
requires 2 metal-dependent consecutive steps in the viral replication cycle: 3'-processing and strand 
transfer.  Viral cDNA is primed for integration in the cytoplasm by integrase-mediated trimming of the 
3'-ends of the viral DNA.  Integrase remains bound to the viral cDNA ends in the pre-integration 
complexes (PICs).  Following nuclear translocation of the PICs, integrase catalyses the insertion of the 
viral cDNA ends into the host chromosomes.  Following integration of viral cDNA into a chromosome, 
viral genome is transcribed, and viral proteins are produced.  HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors 
(INSTI), such as CAB, preferentially block the strand transfer step. 
Non-clinical studies conducted to support the development of CAB include primary pharmacology 
(virology) studies, which demonstrated the inhibition of integrase activity and HIV-1 replication in vitro 
as well as studies to determine the potential for HIV resistance to develop via mutations.  In vitro 
secondary pharmacologic activity was assessed, and safety pharmacology studies were conducted to 
investigate any untoward pharmacologic actions of CAB on the respiratory, cardiovascular, central and 
peripheral nervous systems.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
 Primary pharmacodynamics  
The primary pharmacodynamics of CAB regarding antiviral activity, selectivity and studies on resistance 
are presented and discussed in detail in the clinical part of the report. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The  applicant  has  in  vitro  evaluated  the  binding  properties  of  CAB  to  a  panel  of  16  enzymes,  64 
receptors/ion channels and 12 isolated tissues. No considerable changes in assay responses were found 
as a result of CAB administration. The only exception was significant inhibition (53%) of the MC4 receptor 
at  10  μM  CAB,  which  is  >100-fold  above  the  unbound  clinical  Cmax.  The  applicant  did  not  test  for 
inhibition of other MC receptors. These receptors are involved in e.g. pigmentation, feeding behaviour 
and regulation of metabolism. However, in agreement with the applicant, absence of in vivo effects (in 
toxicity  studies)  that  could  be  related  to  MC(4)  receptor  inhibition  by  CAB  indicate  that  no  off-target 
biological effects are to be expected with the use of CAB.  
The secondary pharmacology of CAB has been sufficiently investigated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 29/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety pharmacology 
CAB was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays including assessing effects on central nervous 
system (CNS)/neurobehavior, cardiovascular, and respiratory function.  
In  vitro  pharmacology  studies  showed  that  CAB  did  no  inhibit  of  the  hERG  channel  up  to  the  highest 
concentration tested due to solubility propriety (7.14 µg/mL, ∼ 1x / ∼ 2x the clinical CAB concentration 
following 30 mg/d PO 1 month / 400 mg IM once monthly following initial administrations respectively). 
CAB  had  no  effects  in  respiratory  assay  whereas  a  slight  effect  on  arterial  pressure  (mild  transient 
increase 3.7 to 8.6%) and transient increase in heart rate (16 to 23%) during the first 2h after dosing 
was observed in monkeys at the highest oral dose of 1000 mg/kg (Cmax ∼ 67 µg/mL) without ECG change 
associated  following  single  dose  or  in  the  14-day  toxicity  study.  According  the  applicant,  since  the 
increase in heart rate was evident during the time of elevated arterial pressures, this suggests that the 
increase in heart rate was not baroreflex mediated; but rather, due to a positive chronotropic effect of 
CAB on the heart. The exposure margin of CAB in the safety pharmacology assays was at least 4-fold 
compared to the clinical Cmax (8.1 µg/mL / 4.2 µg/mL at the clinical CAB concentration following 30 
mg/d PO 1 month / 400 mg IM once monthly following initial administrations respectively in POPPK).  
Taken together, CAB does not appear to have a potential for adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects. 
Effects on neurobehavioral function have been assessed in a rat 14-day oral toxicity study. The applicant 
stated that no effects occurred throughout the assessment interval of up to 25 hours following dosing 
on Day 5.  
In general, the exposure margins of CAB in the safety pharmacology assays were in the range 1-8-fold 
compared to the clinical Cmax in subjects. 
In  conclusion,  no  major  safety  issues  were  identified  in  the  non-clinical  safety  pharmacology  studies 
performed.  Moreover,  no  adverse  safety  concerns  related  to  CNS,  CV  or  respiratory  function  were 
observed in the assessment of the clinical studies for CAB. Generally, sufficient exposure margins were 
observed in rats and monkeys as compared to the exposures seen with the proposed human doses.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted for CAB.  
Based on the pharmacodynamics data, CAB is a highly specific and selective HIV-1 integrase inhibitor 
and the potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions is unlikely. 
The concomitant administration of CAB with RPV is intended to provide two different mechanisms of 
inhibition of viral growth and so ensure that viral breakthrough does not occur in HIV-infected patients 
with undetectable viral load.  Thus, pharmacodynamic interaction is an intended component of the 
therapeutic activity of this combination, and no adverse interaction is anticipated. 
Primary pharmacology data showed that anti-viral activity of CAB was compatible with rilpivirine, 
lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. Because CAB will only be used in 
combination with RPV, this will be sufficient. In addition, other -primarily PK- drug interactions have 
been evaluated clinically (see clinical section). Therefore, the absence of specific non-clinical PD drug 
interaction studies for CAB can be endorsed. There is no need to mention any PD drug interaction with 
CAB in the SmPC.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
CAB quantified by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) 
in plasma samples of mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey. The metabolic profiling of CAB was conducted by 
using chromatographic separation with radiometric detection and identification of metabolites performed 
by  using  LC-MS;  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  methods  were  used  to  confirm  structures  not 
confirmed by mass spectrometric methods. The bioanalytical methods are considered adequate.  
Absorption 
CAB was rapidly absorbed after repeat oral dose in rat, dog and monkey, with mean Tmax in plasma 
ranging from <4h in rats and monkeys, which is similar to Tmax in humans (3h). Moderate to high oral 
bioavailability is observed from a solution formulation and low when administered as a suspension or 
capsule formulation. The oral absorption of CAB seems to be limited by its solubility and/or dissolution 
rate. 
No apparent gender differences were observed in mouse, rat and monkey after oral or IM administration. 
Increases in plasma exposure (AUC) was less than dose proportional to oral dose in mouse, rat, monkey. 
No apparent major accumulation after multiple daily dosing was noted for mouse, rat or monkey.  
Concerning IM administration, CAB was slowly released with Tmax up to 7d in rats, and Tmax 5d and 
mean half-life (up to 21 days) in monkey which is similar to PK in humans (Tmax 7d / t1/2: 5.6 to 11.5 
weeks).  Increases  in  plasma  exposure  (AUC)  was  less  than  dose  proportional  to  IM  dose  in  rat  and 
monkey. No accumulation has been observed.   
No PK interaction between CAB and rilpivirine has been observed in rat or monkeys. 
The  plasma  clearance  (<2%  of  hepatic  plasma  flow)  and  steady-state  volume  of  distribution  (<0.35 
L/kg) were low after IV administration of CAB, with half-life values of 4 to 6 hours in dogs and monkeys 
(the sampling regimen in the rat was insufficient to characterise the pharmacokinetic parameters by IV). 
Distribution 
The percentage of CAB bound to plasma proteins was >99.9% in rats, 99.3% in dogs, 99.7% in 
monkeys and 99.6% in humans. 
Concerning  distribution  following  oral  administration,  concentrations  of  radioactivity  reached  maximal 
levels  for  the  majority  of  tissues  at  D1,  and  was  slowly  absorbed  (most  tissues  containing  low  but 
quantifiable radioactivity at 28 days). Excluding the GI tract, highest levels were associated with blood 
(23.0 µg equivalents of CAB/g of tissue), lung (19.0 µg equivalents of CAB/g of tissue), bulbourethral 
gland (14.6 µg equivalents of CAB/g of tissue), renal medulla (12.5 µg equivalents of CAB/g of tissue), 
adrenal medulla (12.0 µg equivalents of CAB/g of tissue) and pigmented skin (10.7 µg equivalents of 
CAB/g  of  tissue).  At  the  final  sampling  time  of  28  days,  radioactivity  was  still  present  at  low  but 
quantifiable levels (0.546 – 0.095 µg equivalents of CAB/g of tissue) in over 50% of the tissues. Levels 
of radioactivity in the brain were low but quantifiable up to 28 days post-dose (in meninges and pineal 
body). It could be noted that radioactivity is higher in pigmented skin than non-pigmented skin at 1h 
and  28  days  post-dose.  However,  no  selective  association  of  radioactivity  with  melanin  has  been 
observed  with  similar  radioactivity  observed  between  pigmented  and  non-pigmented  skin  over  the 
remaining time, and the radioactivity remains low.   
Metabolism 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 31/140 
 
 
 
 
The in vitro metabolism of CAB was evaluated in liver microsomes and hepatocytes of rat, dog, monkey 
and human and in vivo in mouse, rat, monkey and human.  
In vivo 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  in  mice,  rat,  monkey,  human  unchanged  compound  was  the  only 
radiochemical  component  of  drug-related  material  in  plasma,  representing  92-99%  of  radioactivity, 
without any metabolite present in the plasma at concentrations above the quantifiable limit (i.e. 5% of 
parent or drug related material).  
The  predominant  biotransformation  product  in  mice,  rats,  monkey  and  humans  was  CAB  glucuronide 
(M1)  eliminated  by  renal  and  biliary  routes  (1-20%),  and  a  glucose  conjugate  (M2;  1-2%)  was  also 
observed  only  in  rats  and  monkeys.  These  conjugated  metabolites  (M1  and  M2)  are  not 
pharmacologically active because according the applicant they disrupt the two-metal binding capability 
of  the  carbamoyl  pyridine  motif  of  CAB  thereby  completely  abrogating  any  antiviral  activity  resulting 
from the active site binding to the integrase enzyme. CAB conjugates were not present in faeces in all 
species  but  were  present  only  in  urine/bile  and  therefore  according  the  applicant  were  likely 
deconjugated in the intestine by host or bacterial enzymes after secretion in the bile to reform CAB. The 
only  metabolite  identified  in  human  in  vivo  (M1)  was  present  in  other  species  following  oral 
administration of CAB. Other metabolites observed in animal (M2, M3, M5, M6) were present at low or 
trace levels. M2, M3 and M4 were minor metabolites in human, indicating that there were no metabolites 
in humans that were not identified in the nonclinical species. 
CAB  has  two  chiral  centres,  and  the  potential  for  metabolism  of  CAB  to  its  respective  enantiomer 
(GSK1245960)  and  one  of  the  two  diastereomers  (GSK1417963)  was  investigated.  The  other 
diastereomer of CAB was not available as a synthetic standard at the time of this study and its formation 
could  not  be  monitored.  In  vitro  studies  showed  no  significant  metabolic  conversion  of  CAB  to  its 
enantiomer or one of two possible diastereomers occurs in rat, dog, monkey or human hepatocytes. 
A glutathione adduct of CAB was detected in rat, monkey and human (but not in dog) liver microsomes. 
Covalent binding of CAB-associated radioactivity to liver microsomes was moderate in human (180 pmol-
eq/mg of protein/h) and high in rat and monkey (984 and 794 pmol-eq/mg of protein/h). The applicant 
estimates  that  the  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  in  humans  is  low  at  clinically  relevant  doses  of  CAB.  The 
argument was that metabolic products produced via this pathway represented only a very small fraction 
of CAB metabolic clearance and the fact that no liver toxicity was observed in the nonclinical species. 
However,  since  patients  may  individually  slightly  differ  in  the  metabolism  of  CAB  or  CAB/rilpivirine 
combination, a risk of idiosyncratic liver toxicity in patients cannot be excluded on theoretical grounds. 
In human, elevated ALT values have been observed with exposure to CAB + rilpivirine during the Phase 
III  development  programme  during  the  phase  III  studies,  there  were  no  cases  of  drug-induced  liver 
injury (DILI) in subjects receiving CAB LA + rilpivirine LA. However, DILI was identified during Phase II 
and a clinical pharmacology study, in 5 subjects receiving oral CAB (incidence was <1%) and during the 
Phase IIIb study, in one subject receiving oral CAB + oral rilpivirine (see also in clinical safety). 
Elimination 
The parent compound, CAB, was excreted via the faeces, accounting for ~95% in mice and rats, ~80% 
in monkeys and ~60% in humans, relative to the administered CAB dose. The urinary excretion of CAB-
related material was greater in humans (approximately 27%) than in the nonclinical species (≤11.1%). 
The metabolite M1 (CAB glucuronide) was not observed in faeces of the nonclinical species and human. 
Metabolites  were  excreted  in  the  bile  and  urine.  In  rodents,  most  of  the  CAB-related  material  was 
secreted into the bile and renal excretion was minimal. In mice and rats, the absorbed radioactivity was

eliminated via both the biliary and renal routes. Biliary excretion accounted for 1.60 to 1.79% of the CAB 
dose in mice (M1, M5) and rats (M1), for 14.5% in monkeys (M1, M2, M3). Since no CAB glucuronide is 
found  in  faeces,  it  is  assumed  that  M1  is  deconjugated  in  the  intestine,  after  secretion  in  the  bile  to 
reform  CAB.  It  is  unlikely  that  enterohepatic  circulation  plays  a  relevant  role  in  human.  The  urinary 
excretion of CAB-related material was 0.81% in mice (M1, M6) 0.31% in rats (CAB, M1, M2, M6), 11.1% 
in monkeys (M1, M2, M3) and 26.8% in humans (M1). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of CAB has been evaluated in a comprehensive set of non-clinical studies. The 
performed studies include repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in monkey, 
in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, male and female fertility and early embryonic development in rodents, 
embryo-foetal development toxicity in rodents and rabbits, peri- and post-natal development studies in 
rodents, carcinogenicity studies and impurity qualifying studies. In general, the non-clinical toxicology 
programme has been performed according to relevant guidelines and in agreement with CHMP advices.  
The main species for toxicological evaluation was rat and monkey. The test species were justified as the 
rodent and non-rodent species with the highest systemic exposure. All selected species are considered 
relevant from a metabolite perspective.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose oral acute toxicity studies have not been conducted in rats or monkeys with CAB; however, 
the  potential  for  acute  toxicity  was  assessed  in  repeat  dose  studies  at  the  highest  possible  systemic 
exposure based on saturation of absorption (rat) or highest tolerable dose (monkey). No adverse clinical 
observations  were  noted  following  administration  of  CAB  to  rats  at  ≤1000  mg/kg/day  in  the  4-week 
toxicity study. CAB was not tolerated at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day in the 14-day monkey toxicity study 
and resulted in morbidity associated with clinical signs suggestive of GI effects including body weight 
loss, emesis, loose/watery faeces, inappetence and moderate to severe dehydration. 
A series of single dose toxicity studies were performed to assess the effects of administration of oral, 
subcutaneous and intramuscular doses of CAB, and to compare the toxicokinetics for the different routes 
of administration; results were consistent with findings from repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
The toxicological profile of CAB has been evaluated in general oral toxicity studies up to 26-week duration 
in the rat, 13-week duration in mouse and 39-week duration in the monkey in addition to the 3 months 
duration in rat treated by IM. CAB was well tolerated without major adverse effects in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice, rats and monkey. In the 14-day toxicity study in monkey, a high mortality was observed 
in males given 1000 mg/kg/day, and were associated with GI effects. The effects on the GI tract are 
considered due to local irritation of the compound as opposed to a systemic effect and have not been 
consistently observed in clinical trials to date. It could be noted that ocular effect has been observed in 
two monkeys in the 39-weeks study. Slight vascular inflammation was noted unilaterally near the optic 
nerve of a single monkey (Animal No. 402) dosed with 500 mg/kg/day and inflammation and swelling of 
the  optic  nerve  head  with  peripapillary  oedema  and  diffuse  corneal  opacity  was  observed  in  a  single 
animal (302) dosed with 50 mg/kg/day. The applicant considers this ocular event as incidental. Maximum 
achieved CAB plasma exposures in the longest duration studies were 3203 and 542 µg∙hr/mL for the rat 
and  monkey  respectively.  These  AUC  exposures  correspond  to  22-fold  and  4-fold  the  clinical  AUC 
exposure in patients, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 33/140 
 
 
 
 
After monthly SC and IM administration of the CAB injectable solution in rats, sufficient exposure levels 
were  reached  (3  months,  100  mg/kg  monthly  SC,  MOE:  26.64-47.38;  75  mg/kg  monthly  IM,  MOE: 
31.72-43.51). Four high dose animals were euthanised due to deteriorating conditions or found dead. 
The cause of moribundity or death in these animals was not linked to any underlying pathology findings, 
as none of these animals had explanatory pathology findings distinct from survivors. Therefore, these 
deaths  were  unlikely  treatment  related.  Besides  dose-proportional  signs  of  redness,  swelling  and 
inflammation following SC and IM injections at all dose levels, no additional adverse effects were noted. 
Injections site reactions are also observed in clinical trials.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
CAB was negative in a complete set of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. CAB has demonstrated a 
lack  of  carcinogenic  potential  in  conventional  oral  2-year  studies  in  mouse  and  rats  at  doses 
corresponding 7 and 19-fold the clinical AUC exposure in patients. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In male and female rats, no cabotegravir-related effect on fertility was observed at oral doses up to 1000 
mg/kg/day inducing exposure levels (AUC) at least 20-fold higher than those reached in patients treated 
at the oral recommended dose of 30 mg/day.  
Embryo-fetal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  rabbits  at  oral  doses  up  to  1000  and  2000 
mg/kg/day,  respectively.  In  rats,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  treatment-related  increase  incidence  of 
fetal  anomalies  at  any  dose  level.  Based  on  a  decrease  in  fetal  weights  at  the  high  dose  level,  the 
developmental  NOAEL  was  determined  at  5  mg/kg/day.  At  this  dose,  maternal  exposure  levels  were 
approximately 4-fold those reached in patients treated orally at 30 mg/day. In rabbits, the absence of 
treatment-related  effect  on  embryo-fetal  development  is  claimed  at  all  dose  levels.  The  applicant 
provided the relevant historical control data and discussed adequately on the findings reported at ovarian 
examination  and  fetal  morphological  examination.  It  can  be  concluded  that  that  there  was  neither 
treatment-related increase in postimplantation loss nor treatment-related increase in fetal malformations 
at  oral  doses  up  to  2000 mg/kg/day  (0.7-fold  exposure  at  MHRD)  under  the experimental  conditions 
used in this study.  
In the initial PPND study, rats were treated from GD6 to LD20 at oral doses ranging from 0.5 to 1000 
mg/kg/day. At the high dose level, treatment-related decreases in F1  pup survival and viability at the 
were  observed  (increased  number  of  stillborn  pups  and  neonatal  mortality  from  PND1  to  PND4);  it 
resulted in reduced litter sizes during the first 4 days of life. A follow-up study confirmed these adverse 
findings and cross-fostering experiments showed that perinatal mortality was attributable to gestational, 
but not to lactational, exposure to CAB. In both studies, the duration of gestation at 1000 mg/kg/day 
was  longer  than that  of  controls,  but  remained  within the  historical  control  range.  There  was  also no 
treatment-related effect on the average pup delivery time in any study (a finding which could account 
for increased stillbirth or neonatal mortality). The follow-up PPND study showed that the proportion of 
stillbirth on GD23 (i.e. pups born from dams with delayed onset of parturition was 3.5-fold higher in the 
treated  group  than  in  the  control  group  (1.3%  vs.  4.6%;  or  2/152  vs.  22/478),  and  was  above  the 
historical  control  data.  It  is  also  noted  that  stillbirth  was  not  reported  on  GD22  in  the  control  group 
(0/305 pups) whereas it affected 2/99 pups (2%) born on that day. Moreover, the number of pups born 
on GD23 and dead on PND1 prior to cross-fostering was clearly increased in the treated (17) vs. control 
(0) group.  
The applicant provided the relevant historical control data and discussed adequately on the findings 
reported at ovarian examination and foetal morphological examination. It can be concluded that there 
was neither treatment-related increase in post-implantation loss nor treatment-related increase in 
Assessment report

foetal malformations at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (0.7-fold exposure at MHRD) under the 
experimental conditions used in this study.  
SmPC is amended to report that the 2000 mg/kg/day dose level actually induced maternotoxicity in 
rabbits: In an embryo-foetal development study there were no adverse developmental outcomes 
following oral administration of cabotegravir to pregnant rabbits up to a maternal toxic dose of 
2000 mg/kg/day (0.66 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD) or to pregnant rats at doses up to 
1000 mg/kg/day (>30 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD ( see section 5.3)  
Investigations conducted showed that perinatal mortality was not related to decreased maternal care, 
or treatment-related malformations. An additional investigative TK study indicates that exposure levels 
of both maternal animals and pups were similar at GD20 when dams were treated from GD6. Therefore, 
although the NOAEL for perinatal mortality is set at 5 mg/kg/day, determining a safety margin based on 
systemic  exposure  levels  measured  at  this  dose  could  be  misleading.  Postnatal  development  of  pups 
surviving on PND4 was not shown to be affected by treatment.  
No study was conducted with the CAB-RPV combination which is acceptable. RPV is already marketed in 
Europe, and studies conducted in animals have shown no effect on reproductive function. Studies in rats 
and rabbits reported also no evidence of embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. 
Phototoxicity 
CAB did not absorb light  within  the  range  of  natural  sunlight  and  is  not  considered  to  pose  a  risk  for 
phototoxicity in humans. 
Other studies 
CAB could be considered to be non-irritant and non-sensitiser, non-immunosuppressive.  No antigenicity, 
dependence or metabolite studies were performed with CAB. This is agreed. 
Concerning the association CAB/RPV, it should be acknowledged the lack of combination toxicity studies 
due to the clinical experience with CAB and RPV, the lack of similar target organ indicating a potential 
additive/synergic interaction. Concerning the association CAB/RPV, it should be acknowledged the lack 
of combination toxicity studies due to the clinical experience with CAB and RPV, the lack of similar target 
organ  indicating  a  potential  additive/synergic  interaction.  The  scientific  advice  adopted  by  the  CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/2517/1/2013/III) was agreed for this point. 
Impurities 
Data  generated  in  standard  and/or  impurity-spiked  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  are  considered 
sufficient to qualify the proposed specifications for the  CAB- impurities and degradation products.    The 
control strategy for the genotoxic or potentially genotoxic impurities are considered as adequate.   
Local Tolerance  
CAB could be considered to be non-irritant and non-sensitiser. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020

Cabotegravir is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB. The PBT assessment can be finalised. 
A risk to the STP, surface water, groundwater, sediment and terrestrial compartment is not anticipated 
based on the prescribed use of Cabotegravir. It can be concluded that there is no potential risk to the 
surface water compartment, the ground water compartment, the sediment compartment and the sewage 
treatment plant. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In general, the pharmacology of CAB is well established and described. See also discussion in clinical 
section. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  analytical  methods  developed  for  the  analysis  of  CAB-glucuronide  in  the  in-vitro  and  in-vivo 
metabolism studies and the in vitro drug transporter assays have been described in the individual studies.  
The metabolite M1 (CAB glucuronide) was not observed in faeces of the nonclinical species and human. 
Since no CAB glucuronide is found in faeces, it is assumed that M1 is deconjugated in the intestine, after 
secretion in the bile to reform CAB. It is unlikely that enterohepatic circulation plays a relevant role in 
human.  
Toxicology 
It could be noted that ocular effect has been observed in two monkeys in the 39-weeks study. Slight 
vascular inflammation was noted unilaterally near the optic nerve of a single monkey (Animal No. 402) 
dosed  with  500  mg/kg/day  and  inflammation  and  swelling  of  the  optic  nerve  head  with  peripapillary 
oedema and diffuse corneal opacity was observed in a single animal (Animal No. 302) dosed with 50 
mg/kg/day. The applicant considers that these ocular effects as incidental. 
Besides  the  combined  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rats,  the 
effects of CAB on embryofoetal development were also examined in Dutch belted rabbits. No findings 
were observed; however exposure was very low (high dose 2000 mg/kg/day, MOE: 0.66).  
The  applicant  states  that  all  6  specified  impurities  (GSK3117145A,  GSK3117146A,  GSK3036873A, 
GSK1265748A,  GSK1245960A  and  GSK1417963A)  were  considered  not  genotoxic  based  on  in  silico 
assessments. 
ERA 
It can be concluded that there is no potential risk to the surface water compartment, the ground water 
compartment, the sediment compartment and the sewage treatment plant.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  overall  programme  including  the  data  from  CAB  studies  is  considered  adequate  to  support  the 
efficacy and safety CAB in combination with RPV.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
In Phase 2 studies LATTE and LATTE-2, significant GCP concerns associated with an investigator were 
observed.  This  site  was  closed  and  the  ongoing  participants  were  transferred  to  another  site  and 
investigator.  Actions  were  taken  to  ensure  the  safety  of  subjects  and  the  integrity  of  study  data.  A 
sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  for  both  studies,  concluding  that  the  exclusion  of  the  data  is  not 
expected to have an impact on the overall study interpretations. 
In  Phase  3  studies  FLAIR  and  ATLAS,  significant  GCP  concerns  associated  with  an  investigator  were 
observed.  This  site  was  closed  and  the  ongoing  participants  were  transferred  to  another  site  and 
investigator. Data from these subjects was not compromised, and therefore not excluded from analyses. 
The applicant was requested to provide more information regarding the deficiencies at these sites. This 
information was provided and was considered that they did not have an impact on the overall conclusions 
of the studies.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Thirteen Pharmacokinetic studies were provided, as well as five studies with punctual PK data, a 
population PK modelling report, and a meta-analysis report on relationships between UGT1A1 and 1A9 
genotypes and Cabotegravir PK. 
Absorption 
After IM injection of the LA form, cabotegravir exhibits absorption rate-limited (flip-flop) PK because 
CAB is slowly absorbed into the systemic circulation following IM injection into the gluteus medius 
muscle. CAB LA absorption rate-limited PK is reflected in a long apparent t1/2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 39/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CAB is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with an absorption rate of 1.41 h-1 and a median 
tmax of 3 hours. 
Bioavailability 
Mass-balance study LAI117008 showed that 26.8% of the radioactivity was eliminated in urine after a 
single oral dose of marked Cabotegravir, therefore it can be inferred that absolute bioavailability is at 
least  26.8%.  Along  with  information  on  solubility  (see  introduction  here  and  see  Quality  report),  the 
suggested BCS classification for Cabotegravir in BCS class II is acceptable from a PK standpoint. 
Bio-equivalence 
Study LAI116815 led to selection of the 200 nm nanomilled formulation for LA IM injections. 
In study ITZ111682, the oral tablet resulted in a lower exposure than the solution, by 0.6 to 0.7 fold, 
and Tmax was shorter for the solution. 
In Study LAI116585, both free acid candidate formulations provided relative bioavailability of at least 
50% to that of the current sodium salt. The AUC of the nanomilled and micronised formulations were 
approximately 12% and 48% lower than those of the sodium salt tablet formulation, respectively. These 
data suggest that switching to a free acid oral formulation is viable. 
In Study LAI117020, neither new formulation met the criteria for progression into Phase 3. 
In study 201741, both test formulations made with micronised drug substance met the preestablished 
acceptance criteria. Neither of the test formulations made with unmicronised drug substance met the 
acceptance criteria. Since a smaller tablet is desirable for ease of administration, the tablet formulation 
with the core tablet weight of 500 mg, utilizing micronised GSK1265744B drug substance was selected 
for progression into phase 3 studies. 
Overall, decisions on change and choice of formulations are well detailed and justified. 
Influence of food 
Food effect data came from studies 205696, LA1I17020 and ITZ111682. 
In study LAI117020, food did not affect 744 PK following administration of the test micronised tablet. 
In study ITZ111682, the presence of food increased GSK1265744 AUC(0-inf) and C24 by 15% and had 
no effect on Cmax for the tablet formulation when compared to tablets administered in the fasted state. 
In study 205696, bioavailability was increased by 4-17% by a high fat meal. 
Overall, the food effect can be considered consistent enough through oral formulations and small enough 
(15%) that cabotegravir can be administered with or without food. 
Distribution 
Distribution  volumes  are  in  the  smaller  range  but  suggest  some  distribution  of  cabotegravir  to 
extracellular space. Population PK estimates were for Vc/F 5.27 L and Vp/F 2.43 L, slightly lower than 
the estimates from the studies. 
The in vitro protein binding of cabotegravir in serum or plasma was high (>99%) across species, the 
association  of  cabotegravir  related  material  with  blood  cellular  components  was  minimal  in  both 
nonclinical species and human ranging from 0.44 to 0.57. 
Elimination 
Average CL/F ranged between 0.25 L/h (CV 20%) and 0.37 L/h (CV 32%). Average T1/2 after oral dosing 
ranged from 36.3 h (CV 20%) and 42.83h (CV 23%). For IM doses, the terminal elimination half-life was

representative of the release rate from injection site (in Study LAI116815: T1/2 geometric mean CV% 
were  between  337.43  h  (40%)  and  615.08  h  (29%)).  This  very  long  release  made  estimating  this 
parameter complicated, hence the uncertainty. 
Excretion 
Following  single  dose  administration  of  [14C]-CAB  30  mg  oral  solution  in  humans,  85.3%  of  the 
administered dose was recovered in the excreta; 58.5% of the dose was recovered in faeces and 26.8% 
was  recovered  in  urine.  CAB  accounted  for  46.8%  of  the  administered  dose  in  faeces  and  was  not 
detected  in  urine.  The  glucuronide  metabolite  GSK3388352  (M1)  represented  the  majority  of  the 
radioactivity recovered in urine.  
Both CAB and GSK3388352 were detected in bile. 
Metabolism 
In  the  human  mass  balance  study,  CAB  was  the  predominant  circulating  metabolite  in  plasma, 
representing 80.5 to 100% of plasma total radiocarbon in pooled plasma samples collected 2 to 24 hours 
post-dose  and  the  majority  of  the  plasma  radiocarbon  AUC(0-inf);  no  metabolites  were  quantified  in 
pooled plasma samples. 
Based  on  metabolic  profiling  in  urine,  faeces,  and  bile,  glucuronidation  leading  to  formation  of 
GSK3388352  (M1)  is  the  primary  metabolic  pathway,  accounting  for  20%  of  the  administered  dose. 
Glucose  conjugation  leading  to  formation  of  M2  is  a  minor  pathway  for  CAB  metabolism;  M2  was 
detected, but not quantified, in urine. Unchanged CAB and GSK3388352 (M1) were detected in duodenal 
bile  samples.  CAB  is  the  major  component  in  plasma  and  the  glucuronic  acid  metabolite  is  the 
predominant component in urine, regardless of route of administration  
In  human  studies  LAI115428  and  LAI114433,  mass  spectrometric  analyses  determined  that  M3  (a 
metabolite formed by oxidation, fluorine loss and cysteine conjugation) represented <1% of the drug-
related material present in the urine following oral, IM, and SC administration. 
These conjugated metabolites, CAB glucuronide and M2, are not pharmacologically active. 
Only unchanged CAB was observed in the faeces of all species. 
The only quantifiable metabolite observed in human urine was CAB glucuronide and this was also the 
predominant metabolite observed in the urine of the nonclinical species.

Figure 3 Metabolic profiling of Cabotegravir 
Inter-conversion 
CAB  has  2  chiral  centres.  Following  repeat  oral  administration  of  CAB  for  14  days  to  healthy  human 
volunteers, no evidence for the in vivo epimerisation of CAB to any of its stereoisomers was observed. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
As none of the metabolites are pharmacologically active and no metabolites were quantified in pooled 
plasma samples, PK of metabolites was not further studied. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Meta-analysis 2051612 shows that UGTA1 activity polymorphism will impact Cabotegravir PK, but in 
proportions not expected to have clinical impact (mean values of Ctau, AUCtau, and Cmax ~1.5, 1.4 
and 1.3-fold higher in subject with low relative to normal predicted activity). This conclusion is 
acceptable 
Dose-proportionality and time-dependency 
In Study ITZ111451, PK exposure increased less than proportionally between 5 and 50 mg oral SD and 
proportionally between 5 and 25 mg oral MD. 
In study LAI114433, Plasma GSK1265744 PK parameters increased less than proportionally to dose 
following single unsplit injections from 100-400mg IM; plasma PK parameters appeared to increase 
proportionally to dose following split injections from 400mg (2x 200mg) IM to 800mg (2x 400mg) IM 
and following 100mg to 400mg SC. 
In study LAI115428, PK parameters after IM dosing between 200 mg and 400 mg show under 
proportionality. 
Overall, plasma CAB exposure increases in proportion or slightly less than in proportion to dose 
following single and repeat dose administration of CAB LA 100 to 800 mg IM and oral CAB 5 to 60 mg.

Following single dose administration of a higher dose of oral CAB 150 mg, geometric mean plasma CAB 
Cmax (10.4 microg/mL) and AUC(0-inf) (418 microg.h/mL) were markedly lower than expected 
compared with oral CAB 30 mg (geometric mean Cmax of 3.61 microg/mL and AUC(0-inf) of 146 
microg.h/mL). 
In ITZ111451, steady state was reached at Day 12 after oral MD, and accumulation ratio was 
consistent with a terminal elimination half-life of 40 hours (2.5 observed with truncated data, 2.9 
expected). Overall, PK of cabotegravir appears to be time-independent. 
Inter and intra-variability 
Moderate between-subject variability (%CVb) in plasma CAB PK was observed following repeat-dose 
administration of CAB. Following administration of CAB LA 400 mg Q4W in healthy or HIV-1 infected 
subjects, between subject variability in plasma CAB AUC(0-tau), Cmax, and Ctau ranged from 26 to 
39% across studies. Following administration of oral CAB 30 mg once daily, between-subject variability 
in plasma CAB AUC(0-tau), Cmax, and Ctau ranged from 26 to 34% across healthy subject studies and 
28 to 56% across HIV-1 infected subject studies. Higher between-subject variability (41 to 89%) in 
plasma CAB PK was observed with single dose administration of CAB LA. 
Within-subject variability (%CVw) in plasma CAB PK was low following administration of oral CAB. 
Within-subject variability in plasma CAB AUC(0-tau), Cmax, and Ctau ranged from 7 to 11% following 
repeat dose administration of oral CAB 30 mg once daily. Plasma CAB AUC(0-inf), Cmax, and C24 
ranged from 13 to 32% following single-dose administration of oral CAB 30 mg. Within-subject 
variability data are not available for CAB LA because CAB LA studies were parallel design. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study LAI116181 showed the absence of PK interaction between Cabotegravir and co-prescribed drug 
Rilpivirine are acceptable. Population PK modelling and comparison of data between studies show that 
there is no major difference in PK between target population (HIV1-infected patients) and healthy 
volunteers. 
Regarding population PK modelling, gender, weight and BMI effects are shown, but should not have 
clinical impact, refer to Special Populations section for discussion. Oral treatment for up to 2 months is 
an appropriate replacement in case of missed LA injections.  
Special populations 
The clinical study and the population PK analysis lead to the same conclusion that CAB can be 
administered without dose adjustment in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment (not on renal 
replacement therapy). 
Both population PK analysis and a dedicated clinical study show that CAB may be taken without dose 
adjustment in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
In pop PK modelling, categorisation of Cmin-LD by gender showed that the median was lower in 
females than males by 31%. For Cmin-SS, the impact of all covariates was predicted to be relatively 
small (≤15%). The impact of gender on Cmax-SS were all predicted to be relatively small (≤21%).  
At steady-state, median predicted Cmax-SS was lower and median predicted Cmin-SS was higher in 
females than males, consistent with slower absorption in females than males. The effect of gender did 
not justify any dose modification. 
Race was not a covariate with clinically relevant impact on the PK of CAB after IM dosing.

In pop PK modelling, a categorisation of Cmin-LD by BMI showed that subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 
had 31% lower median Cmin-LD than those with BMI <30 kg/m2. For Cmin-SS, the impact of all 
covariates was predicted to be relatively small (≤15%). The impact of WT and BMI on Cmax-SS were 
all predicted to be relatively small (≤21%). There was an effect of weight and BMI, but small enough 
to no justify any dose modification. 
Age was not a covariate with clinically relevant impact on the PK of CAB after IM dosing. 
There are no PK data for Cabotegravir in children, it is not intended for paediatric use. 
There were only very few elderly subjects enrolled in the clinical studies. Patients are recorded in the

studies 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant conducted a large programme of in vitro and in vivo studies to establish the DDI profile 
of cabotegravir. Hence, around twenty in vitro studies, one PBPK modelling and simulation, one 
mechanistic analysis and 5 clinical DDI studies.  
• 
In vitro  
  CAB and CYP 
CAB does not undergo metabolism through CYP enzymes: oxidation of CAB accounts for <1% dose in 
humans. Consequently, any drug-drug interactions with CAB, as a victim, driven by CYPs inhibition or 
induction are not expected to be clinically relevant. Of note, CAB is mainly glucuronidated and some CYP 
inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenobarbital) or inhibitors (e.g. imatinib, ketoconazole) also induce or inhibit 
UGTs. 
The  ability  of  CAB  to  be  a  competitive  and  mechanism-based  inhibitor  (MBI)  of  the  main  CYP450 
enzymes,  CYP1A2,  CYP2C8,    2B6  CYP2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  3A4/5,  2A6,  was  investigated  (study 
2012N151766) and with a range of CAB concentrations from 0.1 to 100 µM. Results show that, at the 
highest  tested  concentration  (which  is  more  than  3-fold  CAB  worst  expected  concentrations  at  the 
intestinal level, i.e. 29.6 µM), no direct or time-dependant inhibition was observed by CAB on CYP1A2, 
2A6, CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and CYP2C8. As regards CYP2B6, no TDI or metabolism inhibition by CAB up

to 100µM appeared but a direct inhibition, about 20% of the enzyme, at 100 µM. Nonetheless this is not 
expected to have any clinical consequence considering the worst concentration of CAB expected at the 
systemic  level,  i.e.  19  µM.  Conversely,  on  CYP3A4  different  results  were  observed  according  to  the 
control substrate used: a direct inhibition with atorvastatin and nifedipine whereas no direct inhibition 
with midazolam. After 30 minutes preincubation with pooled human liver microsome (PHLM) with NADPH, 
CYP3A4 metabolism-dependant inhibition by CAB is observed. The clinical consequence of such a feature 
has been clarified through results observed in the clinical DDI study LAI116815 assessing the effect of 
CAB  on  midazolam  (a  probe  CYP3A4  substrate)  pharmacokinetics  (see  In  vivo  part).  No  study  was 
performed with testosterone as substrate, but this may well be because the in vitro interaction studies 
were performed before the outcome of the current Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions 
(i.e. in 2007 and 2012). It is agreed that there is likely low risk of CYP3A inhibition by CAB because no 
relevant  inhibition  potential  was  found  in  vitro  using  3  different  substrates  and  CAB  had  no  clinically 
relevant  effect  on the exposure to  midazolam  in  the  clinic.  Also,  CAB  had  no significant  effect  on  the 
exposure to ethinyl estradiol and rilpivirine, which are also CYP3A substrates. The effect of CAB on the 
exposure to rilpivirine is shown in the table below. Overall, the risk of CYP3A inhibition by CAB is likely 
to be low. 
The CYP inducing potential of CAB on CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 was investigated in study 2013N166279. 
The  applicant  concluded  that  CAB  does  not  induce  any  tested  CYPs.  However,  this  conclusion  is  not 
supported based on the data provided. Results that arise from this study remain inconclusive. Indeed, 
the main issue is the inconsistency of mRNA level responses according to each donor and according to 
CAB  concentrations.  As 
Interactions 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.  1)  highlights  the  appraisal  of  any  inducing  potential  should  be  made  at  the 
mRNA donor level (“the donor cells with the most pronounced induction effect on the specific enzyme 
should then be used as a “worst case” in the subsequent calculations”) and not based on the mean mRNA 
level,  as  done  by  the  applicant.  Then,  for  at  least  one  donor,  at  CAB  0,03  µM  the  lower  tested 
concentration, CAB increased more than 2-fold mRNA level of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6.

the 
There  is  an  unsolved  experimental  reason  that  perhaps  could  explain  such  irregular  responses  to 
induction through the range of CAB concentrations.  Therefore, the applicant agreed to perform another 
in vitro study assessing the CAB inducing potential on CYP1A2 and 2B6 to be included in a future type II 
variation. CAB will be incubated with cryopreserved human hepatocytes for 48 hrs and mRNA levels for 
CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 will be determined. Positive control inducers will be included, and cell viability checks 
will be performed.

Table 5 mRNA level responses according to each donor and to CAB concentrations 
CAB and UGTs  
CAB is predominantly metabolised by UGT1A1 and, in a lesser extent, UGT1A9. Therefore, clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions related to inhibition or induction UGT1A1 are expected (see In vivo 
part). 
The applicant concludes that it is not necessary to perform DDI studies with UGT inhibitors based on the 
pharmacogenetics analysis, in which the exposure to orally administered CAB was shown to increase by 
approximately 1.5-fold in subjects with low UGT1A1 activity. This result can however not be generalised 
to  UGT  inhibitors,  because  individuals  with  low  UGT1A1  activity  still  have  some  activity,  while  some 
strong UGT1A1 inhibitors can completely eliminate UGT1A1 activity. Hence based on this estimation, the 
following statement has been added to the SmPC:  The impact of an UGT1A1 inhibitor may be slightly 
more pronounced, however, considering the safety margins of cabotegravir, this increase is not expected 
to  be  clinically  relevant.  No  dosing  adjustments  for  Vocabria  are,  therefore,  recommended  in  the 
presence  of  UGT1A1  inhibitors  (e.g.  atazanavir,  erlotinib,  sorafenib).  Of  note,  PBPK  modelling  and 
simulations (see In silico part) predicted no clinically significant increase in CAB exposure if combined 
with  atazanavir,  an  UGT1A1  inhibitor.  However,  since  major  issues  have  been  raised  on  the  model 
building results observed cannot be validated and then no conclusion drawn (see in silico part) 
CAB is an inhibitor of UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 with IC50 values of 12 µM and 46 µM, respectively. CAB may 
alter  the  exposure  of  UGT1A3  substrate  (e.g.  naproxen)  at  therapeutic  concentrations  while  IC50  for 
UGT1A9  is  higher  than  the  worst  concentrations  expected  at  the  hepatic  level.  Therefore,  the  risk  of 
clinically  relevant  DDI  related  to  inhibition  of  UGT1A9  is  unlikely  whereas  UGT1A3  inhibition  by  CAB 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020

cannot be ruled out. The ability for CAB to be involved in DDI through UGT1A3 inhibition has been also 
assessed  using  a  mechanistic  approach  (see  thereafter).  The  predicted  AUC  ratio  is  <1.25,  hence  no 
meaningful DDI expected. 
At the highest concentration tested, 100 µM, CAB inhibited UGT1A1 by 15% (in human liver microsomes) 
to 33% (with recombinant UGT1A1) and UGT2B17 by 24%. This is not expected to be clinically relevant.   
In this experiment investigating UGT inhibition, it was indicated that no positive controls were qualified 
for UGT2B4, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 but the metabolic activity of these UGTs was confirmed by the rates 
of substrate metabolism. The results of the positive controls of the other enzymes show that the system 
was functioning adequately. It can also be reasonably assumed that the Supersomes used in the study 
were adequately characterised by Corning® Gentest. 
  CAB and efflux transporters 
CAB is both a P-gp and BCRP substrate. The applicant claims that clinically relevant interactions related 
to CAB combination with a P-gp or  BCRP inhibitor is expected to be unlikely due to its high apparent 
passive permeability. If this assumption could be supported for a combination with either a P-gp or a 
BCRP inhibitor, the clinical consequence of co-administration with a compound that is both a P-gp and a 
BCRP  inhibitor  (e.g.  cyclosporin)  is  unclear.    The  applicant  attempted  to  clarify  this  issue  by  using 
rilpivirine as an example of both a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor. The limit of this assertion is the lack of data 
demonstrating rilpivirine is both P-gp and BCRP inhibitor. In vitro rilpivirine has the potential to inhibit 
P-gp, with an IC50 value of 9.2 µM in Caco-2 cells but the clinical relevance of this feature has not been 
explored yet. As regards its effect on BCRP, the applicant justification remains unclear since no in vitro 
and in vivo data have been found out. The applicant additional explanation to ensure safe use of CAB 
with a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor was the high permeability of CAB which varies in a range of 44–83%. 
The lowest bioavailability value reported for CAB is 44% (data from a pharmacokinetic study in dog); 
therefore, the maximum possible increase in systemic exposure of orally administered CAB is 2.3-fold 
assuming complete inhibition of Pgp and BCRP (1/1- fraction excreted ie 1/1-0.56, Zamek-Gliszczynski 
et al, 2009). The bioavailability of CAB in human is estimated to be >85% based on the PBPK model 
(Report  2018N389974);  therefore,  the  clinical  drug  interaction  potential  with  a  dual  Pgp  and  BCRP 
inhibitor will be at most <1.2-fold (ie 1/1-0.15). Long-term administration of CAB 60 mg once daily to 
HIV infected subjects in the LAI116482 (LATTE) study and short-term administration of oral CAB 150 
mg q12h x 3 doses in the LAI117009 (TQT) study provides safety margins of 2-fold to 5.6-fold for the 
unlikely increase due to co-administration of CAB 30 mg with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. Due to the clinical 
safety cover for the worst-case increases in CAB exposure due to P-gp and BCRP inhibition, the applicant 
proposes that a clinical study with CAB and cyclosporine is not required. This is considered acceptable. 
At  therapeutic  concentrations,  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  related  to  P-gp  and  BCRP 
inhibition by CAB are not expected. 
CAB is neither a BSEP nor a MRP2 and MRP4 inhibitor.  However, it is unknown whether CAB inhibits or 
not MRP3. The applicant used methotrexate as an example to demonstrate any lack of interaction related 
to  MRP3  inhibition  with  CAB  but  since  other  efflux  transporters  may  overcome  to  a  potential  MRP3 
inhibition of MTX by CAB, MTX appears to not be an adequate probe substrate of MRP3. However, MRP3 
functions as a bile acid basolateral overflow pump in conjunction with MRP4, when canalicular excretion 
of bile acids via BSEP and MRP2 is impaired (Kenna et al, 2018). Unlike Mrp4-knockout mice, bile duct 
ligation in Mrp3-knockout mice did not elicit increases in liver bile acids and liver toxicity.  Therefore, in 
the absence of BSEP, MRP2, and MRP4 inhibition, physiological relevance of MRP3 inhibition alone to bile 
acid  disposition  is  unclear  (Zamek-Gliszczynski  et  al,  2018;  Kenna  et  al,  2018).  CAB  does  not  inhibit 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 49/140 
 
 
 
 
BSEP, MRP2 or MRP4.  Hence determination of MRP3 inhibition potential in isolation is not of biological 
or clinical significance making an in vitro MRP3 inhibition assay with CAB unnecessary. 
Considering the available data on MRP3 inhibition and its clinical relevance in the absence of BSEP, MRP2, 
and MRP4 inhibition, no further investigations are needed as regards the ability of CAB to inhibit this 
transporter. 
CAB inhibits both MATE1 and MATE2-K with IC50= 18.2µM and 14.2 µM, respectively, covering the worst 
expected at the systemic level, i.e., 19µM. Therefore, clinically relevant interaction with a probe substrate 
as  metformin,  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In order to  predict  the  clinical  impact  of  this  effect,  the  applicant 
developed a mechanistic static model to evaluate CAB as a perpetrator of DDI driven, notably by MATE1 
and MATE2-K inhibition. AUC ratio appeared to be < 1.25. Therefore, no clinically relevant DDI expected 
between CAB and MATE1 and MATE2-K substrates. 
  CAB and uptake transporters 
CAB does not seem to be an OATP1B1, 1B3 or OCT1 uptake transporters substrate. Nonetheless, in the 
experiment,  uptake  of  CAB  into  human  hepatocytes  was  investigated  using  a  mixture  of  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and  OCT1 inhibitors. This study is  considered less reliable than studies with cells 
transfected with human transporters, which are more sensitive. Result of the hepatic uptake assay and 
the high permeability of CAB indicate that hepatic uptake is not the rate-determining step in its clearance. 
It is therefore agreed that further studies for investigating the effect on transporters relevant for hepatic 
uptake are not expected to provide additional relevant information. 
CAB does not inhibit both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 up to 30 µM. Therefore, clinically relevant DDI with 
substrates of these uptake transporters (e.g. statins) are unlikely. 
CAB inhibits both OCT1 and OCT2 but with an IC50>30 µM. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions 
with substrates of these uptake transporters are not expected to be meaningful. 
CAB  inhibits  both  OAT1  and  OAT3  with  IC50=  0.8  µM  and  0.4  µM,  respectively,  covering  the  worst 
expected  at  the  systemic  level,  i.e.,  19  µM.  Therefore,  clinically  relevant  interactions  related  to  their 
inhibition  by  CAB  cannot  be  ruled  out.  To  clarify  this,  feature  a  mechanistic  static  model  and  a  PBPK 
modelling and simulation were conducted. However, since major issues have been raised on the PBPK 
model building, results observed cannot be validated and then no conclusion drawn. A warning has been 
then added in the proposed SmPC as regards this risk. 
  CAB glucuronide as a victim and a perpetrator 
CAB  glucuronide  is  a  substrate  of  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OAT3,  MRP2,  MRP3,  MRP4,  but  was  not 
transported by OAT1 and OAT4. 
Considering the high proportion of CAB glucuronide in urine (CAB glucuronide was the major component, 
representing >75% of drug related material in urine) and the low proportion of CAB glucuronide in bile 
in non-clinical species, and the fact that there is only limited indication for hepatic recirculation (see also 
question 125), it is agreed that most likely, CAB glucuronide is primarily excreted via the urine via rapid 
active elimination. Hence, BSEP is not expected to be relevant in the transport of CAB glucuronide.as 
well as the transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
CAB glucuronide is unlikely to be an inhibitor of MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1 and OAT3.

•  Mechanistic static approach and in silico  
In  vitro  studies  demonstrate  the  ability  of  CAB  to  inhibit  UGT1A3,  UGT1A9,  OAT1,  OAT3,  MATE1  or 
MATE2-K. For tested UGT1A3, UGT1A9, MATE1 or MATE2-K substrates, the predicted AUC are < 1.25. 
Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  no  clinically  DDI  are  expected  when  CAB  is  combined  with  drugs 
metabolised by these UGTs or transporters. Regarding OAT1 and OAT3, it cannot be excluded that their 
inhibition  by  CAB  leads  to  clinically  relevant  DDI  (AUC  ratio>1.25).  To  clarify  such  results  a  PBPK 
modelling and simulations were carried out. 
The  applicant  performed  PBPK  modelling  to  investigate  drug  interactions  with  CAB  as  an  inhibitor  of 
OAT1 and OAT3 substrates, the impact of UGTs inhibitors and inducers on CAB pharmacokinetics and 
some issues remains as regards the qualification and validity of this approach: 
i/ PBPK model for OAT1/3 inhibition 
According  to  the  applicant’s  explanation,  the  PBPK  sensitivity  investigation  predicted  a  maximum 
increase in exposure of up to 1.8-fold with OAT1/3 substrates. The applicant considered these data not 
clinically  relevant.  Such  a  conclusion  is  not  acceptable  knowing  the  narrow  safety  margin  of  the  OAT 
substrate  Methotrexate  and  its  toxicity  notably  on  the  bone  marrow.  These  results  are  considered  as 
positive and cannot rule out CAB to be a clinically relevant OAT1 and OAT3 inhibitor.  Hence according 
to the EU Guideline on DDI studies, when positive results are identified from PBPK modelling, an in vivo 
dedicated DDI study should be performed to assess the real magnitude of the interaction. 
Of note as regards the examples from the clinical data by the applicant using safety data, the low number 
of subjects analysed cannot allow a relevant and reliable appreciation of the impact of CAB on the patient 
safety to be made. Furthermore, safety data are not a very accurate method to establish whether there 
are DDI interactions. 
Considering the limits and deficiency from the PBPK modelling and simulation, the applicant proposed 
SmPC amendment by adding this risk in the SmPC.  Additionally, the combination of CAB with OAT1/3 
substrates having a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. methotrexate) should be added in the RMP as an” 
important potential risk” and this combination should be monitored as part of PSUR. 
ii/ Impact of strong UGT inhibitors on CAB PK 
Considering the limits and deficiency from the PBPK modelling and simulation, the applicant proposed 
SmPC amendment by adding this risk in the SmPC.   
• 
In vivo 
The provided clinical DDI studies were performed with CAB oral route. Results can be extrapolated to 
CAB LA because data observed with the oral route constitute the worst-case scenario.  
-  RIF  significantly  decreases  CAB  AUC  ratio  about  59%  with  95%IC  [0.36-0.46].  Therefore,  the 
combination  of  CAB  with  rifampicin  and  then  with  other  strong  UGT  inducers  (e.g  carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, phenobarbital) is contra-indicated. 
- Rifabutin significantly decreases CAB AUC and Cmax about 21% and 17%, respectively, with 95%IC 
outside the bioequivalence bound of [0.8-1.25], the applicant proposes no dose adjustment of CAB when 
combined  with  rifabutin.  To  justify  that  these  exposures  are  still  sufficiently  high  to  maintain  viral 
suppression, the normal concentration-time profiles are shown for CAB, including the oral lead-in period 
(see Figure 1, for the monthly regimen, also included below). In these figures it can be seen that during 
the oral lead-in period, estimated exposure to CAB is clearly higher than the 0.65 µg/mL benchmark (the 
5th  percentile  of  individual  predicted  trough  concentrations  following  the  CAB  600mg  IM  initiation

injection). Reduction of the concentrations of CAB following oral ingestion during the lead-in period by 
17-26% is not expected to lead to exposures below the 0.65 µg/mL benchmark. The combination of CAB 
with  rifabutin  during  the  oral  lead-in  period  is  therefore  not  expected  to  reduce  exposures  below  the 
benchmark concentration for clinical efficacy. 
      Figure 4               
In section 4.5 of the SmPC for the oral product, there is a difference between the effect of rifabutin on 
CAB exposure during the oral lead-in period and afterwards during the monthly regimen with CAB LA. It 
is  agreed  that the  reduction in  CAB  exposure  following  co-administration  of  oral  CAB  with  rifabutin  is 
considered not clinically relevant. From the simulation of the proposed monthly regimen of CAB LA with 
rifabutin, it appears that only during the first month, the 5th percentile is expected to fall below the 0.65 
µg/mL  benchmark.  Instead  of  advising  completely  against  co-medication  of  CAB  LA  with  rifabutin,  it 
could be considered to advise against this co-medication during the first month only.

Increased Metabolism with the UGT Inducer RBT 
Furthermore, Rifabutin reduced CAB AUC(0-tau), Cmax, and Ctau by 21%, 17%, and 26%, respectively. - No 
DDI observed when CAB is co-administrated with etravirine. The ratio of CAB AUC and Cmax fell within 
the 95%CI of [0.8-1.25]. 
Midazolam pharmacokinetics is not significantly altered after repeated doses of oral CAB 30 mg. If in 
vitro data suggest the ability for CAB to be a CYP3A4 inducer and a time-dependant inhibitor (by MBI), 
the clinical relevance of these features is then not expected to be meaningful. 
The conclusion of the applicant that moderate and weak UGT inducers do not reduce plasma CAB to a 
clinically relevant extent is based on the clinical studies with etravirine and rifabutin. Induction of UGT1A1 
expression by rifabutin was shown, at lower fold change than rifampin (up to 2.9-fold versus up to 5.1-
fold).  Exposure  to  raltegravir  in  combination  with  rifabutin  was  decreased  by  19-39%.  Exposure  to 
raltegravir in combination with rifampin was reported to be reduced by 40%, which could however not 
be found in the referred publication by Brainard et al (2011). However, according to the CDC (Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention), rifampin decreased the trough concentrations of raltegravir 400 mg

Compared  to  rifampin,  which  is  a  known  potent  inducer  of  UGT1A1,  rifabutin  can  be  considered  a 
moderate  inducer.  Etravirine  reduced  raltegravir  exposure  by  10-34%,  which  can  be  considered 
comparable to the reduction caused by rifabutin. Overall, it is plausible that etravirine and rifabutin can 
be considered representative for the moderate UGT1A1 inducers. 
- Oral contraceptives undergo metabolism through UGT and CYP pathways the inhibition or induction of 
which  may  alter  their  efficacy  or  their  safety.  In  the  study  LAI117011,  EE  AUC  ratio  as  well  as  LVG 
exposure fell within the 95%CI of [0.8-1.25]. It can be concluded that no significant DDI are expected 
between CAB and oral contraceptives.  No dose adjustment is then recommended in the SmPC of CAB 
when combined with midazolam or EE/LVG. Nonetheless, knowing the hepatotoxicity of ethinylestradiol, 
an issue is raised as regards the increase risk of hepatotoxicity in case of co-administration with CAB. 
This will be monitored in the post-marketing and as part of the next PSUR.

The  combinations  of  CAB  with  antacids  and  other  mineral  supplements  has  been  discussed  by 
extrapolation of results observed from other integrase inhibitors. 
Based on table 12, administration of antacids and mineral supplements 4 hours after oral Vocabria, as 
is  recommended  in  the  SmPC,  is  not  expected  to  be  a  problem,  considering  that  bictegravir  and 
dolutegravir  were  at  70-100%  of 
their  normal  exposure 
in  case  of  administration  of 
antacids/supplements at 2 h after the bictegravir or dolutegravir.  
The advice of using antacids at least 2 hours before oral Vocabria has been clarified. The combination of 
bictegravir with antacids is the only example given for this situation and it resulted in a decrease in the 
exposure  to  bictegravir  by  52-58%.  The  examples  under  “Simultaneous  administration”  indicate  that 
there is considerable variation in the effect of antacids or supplements on the exposure to bictegravir 
and dolutegravir. Also, the applicant states that polyvalent cation antacid products are not recommended 
for  chronic  use.  However,  since  these  products  are  available  over  the  counter,  it  cannot  be  known 
whether they are used chronically or not.

As regards combination with HCV protease inhibitors,  the clinical consequence of CAB combination 
with HCV inhibitors ledipasvir, pibrentasvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir, glecaprevir, sofosbuvir, 
daclatasvir, elbasvir is expected to be limited considering the permeability of CAB and its safety margin 
( see above impact of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on CAB PK). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
CAB inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step 
of  retroviral  DNA  integration  which  is  essential  for  the  HIV  replication  cycle.  Of  note,  the  chemical 
structure of CAB is very close to dolutegravir (1 additional carbon): 
Cabotegravir: 
 Dolutegravir: 
Similarly to DTG, CAB was highly active with broad activity against all HIV-1 and HIV-2, with comparable 
EC50. Furthermore, virologic resistance properties of CAB and DTG are close:  
- In vitro, a significant decrease of the CAB susceptibility was observed with the emergence of mutations 
Q148K  +  E138K,  and  the  mutations  Q148H  +  at  least  2  INI  mutations.  The  presence  of  mutation 
Q148K/R/H  at  baseline  seems  associated  to  a  higher  risk  of  decreased  susceptibility  to  CAB  and 
potentially virological failure. The INI mutations N155H and E92Q seems to not significantly impact CAB 
activity. However, considering the fold-change values in INI-resistant mutant HIV, DTG seems to have 
a somewhat better susceptibility to the main INI RAM (notably the Q148-mutations):

Among the 591 subjects treated by CAB + RPV in the Phase 3 studies ATLAS and FLAIR, 7 subjects 
experienced virologic failure. The resistance emergence of these 7 subjects is as follows:

ATLAS study: 
In addition, the applicant has performed an efficacy analysis according to the presence or absence of 
the INI RAM L74I. This mutation, present in several subjects at baseline, seems not impact the 
virologic response. 
In study ATLAS-2M, 10 subjects had confirmed virologic failure at Week 48. 
Overall, a higher emergence of CAB RAM (E138E/K, Q148Q/R, N155H) and RPV RAM (K101E, E138A, 
Y188L) is observed with the Q8W regimen. 
The  most  common  HIV-1  subtype  for  all  subjects  was  subtype  B  (174  subjects  in  each  arm,  61%). 
Among the 4 CVF subjects in the FLAIR CAB + RPV group, 3 subjects were from Russia and had Subtype 
A1 virus. In ATLAS, all three subjects with PDVF in the CAB + RPV arm were infected with HIV-1 subtype 
A, A1 or AG. The two subjects with PDVF in LATTE-2 were infected with virus of Subtype B (no phenotypic 
or  genotypic  resistance  to  RPV  or  CAB)  and  Subtype  AG.  In  ATLAS-2M,  HIV-1  subtypes  were  more 
diverse.

As regards the PD properties of CAB on cardiac conduction, the study LAI117009 did not show any effect 
of supratherapeutic doses of CAB (3 doses of CAB 150 mg BID) on QTcF, QTcB and QTci, PR and QRS 
intervals, T wave and U wave, and heart rate.  
Similarly to DTG, there was no relationship between plasma CAB PK parameters and efficacy parameters 
(reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations in the Phase II studies, emergence of virologic failure in 
the Phase III studies). The occurrence of virologic failure should rather due to genotypic characteristics 
of  the  virus.  In  both  FLAIR  and  ATLAS  studies,  no  clinically  significant  relationships  between  CAB 
concentrations  and  QTc  changes,  ALT  changes,  bilirubin  changes  and  toxicity  grades  of  the  most 
frequently reported non-ISR AEs (e.g., diarrhea, headache, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, upper respiratory 
tract infection). 
In both Studies 201584 and 201585, CAB and RPV plasma concentration-time profiles for subjects in the 
LA arm with snapshot HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at Week 48 (n=11 across both studies) were generally below 
the median but within the 5th and 95th percentile of observed data for the remainder of the population

The applicant was requested to discuss the observation that for certain subjects, exposure of both RPV 
as well as CAB is low (suggesting there may be a potential subject–related cause), whereas for other 
subjects  this  is  applicable  to  only  one  of  the  two  components  (pointing  more  towards  an  accidental 
administration error). Additionally, an in-depth analysis of potential factors that these subjects may have 
in common that may have predisposed them to experience virologic failure was requested.  
A post-hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis of the pooled phase 3 studies (ATLAS, FLAIR and 
ATLAS-2M) was performed to examine the influence of baseline viral, participant characteristics, dosing 
regimen,  and  post-baseline  plasma  drug  concentrations  on  confirmed  virologic  failure  (CVF).  This 
analysis included data from 1039 HIV-infected adults with no prior exposure to CAB+RPV, including 13 
subjects 1.25%) with CVF at Week 48. 
Four covariates were significantly associated (P<0.05 for each adjusted odds ratio) with increased risk 
of  CVF:  RPV-RAM  at  baseline  identified  by  proviral  DNA  genotypic  assay,  HIV-1  subtype  A6/A1 
(associated with integrase L74I polymorphism), Ct RPV at 4 weeks following initial injection dose, BMI≥30 
kg/m2 (associated with cabotegravir pharmacokinetics). Other variables including Q4W or Q8W dosing, 
female gender, or other viral subtypes (non A6/A1) had no significant association with CVF. 
No baseline factor, when present in isolation, was predictive of virologic failure. However, a combination 
of at least 2 of the following baseline factors was associated with an increased risk of CVF: rilpivirine 
resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI≥30 kg/m2. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, CAB is a structural analogue to DTG, as evidenced by their similar chemical structures.  
Average T1/2 after oral dosing is around 40 hours and up to around 5.6 to 11.5 weeks  for IM doses.  
Following  single  dose  administration  of  [14C]-CAB  30  mg  oral  solution  in  humans,  85.3%  of  the 
administered dose was recovered in the excreta; 58.5% of the dose was recovered in faeces and 26.8% 
was  recovered  in  urine.  CAB  accounted  for  46.8%  of  the  administered  dose  in  faeces  and  was  not 
detected  in  urine.  The  glucuronide  metabolite  GSK3388352  (M1)  represented  the  majority  of  the 
radioactivity recovered in urine.  
The conjugated metabolites, CAB glucuronide and M2, are not pharmacologically active. 
The  clinical  study  and  the  population  PK  analysis  lead  to  the  same  conclusion  that  CAB  can  be 
administered without dose adjustment in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment (not on renal 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 60/140 
 
 
 
 
replacement  therapy)  and  that  CAB  may  be  taken  without  dose  adjustment  in  subjects  with  mild  to 
moderate hepatic impairment. 
Individually,  gender  (31%  lower  PK  exposure  in  females)  and  BMI  (31%  lower  exposure  in  BMI>30) 
effects are unlikely to be of clinical relevance.  
Cabotegravir  exhibits  a  drug-drug  interaction  profile  that  seems  similar  to  other  integrase  inhibitors 
notably as DTG and BIC. No clinically relevant interaction is expected with CYPs as well as OATPs, OCT2 
uptake and efflux transporters (P-gp/BCRP/BSEP/MATE1/MATE2K) substrates. Likewise, CAB does not 
inhibit OCT2 at therapeutic concentrations, as BIC, whereas DTG is contra-indicated with dofetilide, a 
probe OCT2 substrate.  
Several aspects needed to be clarified to further substantiate the interaction profile of the drug. During 
the review process it was acknowledged that considering the relatively small increase in CAB exposure 
expected  with  OAT1/3  substrate,  this  issue  could  be  monitored  as  part  of  routine  pharmacovigilance 
only. 
Similarly  to  DTG,  CAB  is  effective  on  all  HIV-1  subtypes  and  HIV-2,  with  comparable  EC50  on  these 
clinical isolates. According to their very close chemical structures, the resistance profile of CAB is quite 
similar to DTG, with nonetheless a lower resistance barrier. This is supported in the literature1 and the 
comparative genetic barrier to resistance of the current INI may be rated RAL < EVG < CAB < DTG and 
BIC. The CAB RAM isolated throughout in vitro and clinical studies were E138K and Q148R/K/H. The INI 
mutations L74I, N155H and E92Q, associated to resistance to EVG and/or RAL, seems not significantly 
impact  CAB  activity.  However,  the  development  of  Q148R/K  with  CAB  can  result  in  high-level  cross-
resistance to all INI. CAB was not intended to be administered in subjects with INI RAM, but physicians 
should be aware that emergence of the high-level INI cross-resistance Q148-mutations may be more 
frequent with CAB than DTG and BIC.  
Similarly to the other INIs, no relationship between exposure and efficacy was observed. A minimal CAB 
concentration  level  (0.65  µg/ml)  was  defined  by  the  applicant,  but  the  few  cases  of  virologic  failures 
reported  in  the  clinical  studies  seem  rather  due  to  genotypic  resistance  than  lower  exposure  to  CAB. 
Likewise,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  correlation  between  exposure  and  occurrence  of  AEs, 
notably increase of transaminases and total bilirubin. Supratherapeutic doses of CAB has no impact on 
the cardiac conduction. 
The relatively high frequency of virologic failure in subjects infected with HIV-1 subtype A1/AG in 
FLAIR is of interest (4/18 (22%) in the CAB + RPV arm vs. 1/20 (5%) in the CAR arm). Additional 
information that may inform on the relative risk of virologic failure for different HIV subtypes, from 
ATLAS(-2M) or from earlier studies (including studies with the oral tablets), as well as any relevant 
information from in vitro studies, was requested, as was an analysis of virologic response rates based 
on the plasma HIV-1 RNA <2 c/mL cut-off (ultrasensitive viral load measurements) by HIV-1 subtype. 
The low overall number of events and the relative proportion of participants with similar factors and 
durable efficacy responses, however, it limits the conclusions that can be drawn. 
A post-hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis of the pooled phase 3 studies (ATLAS, FLAIR and 
ATLAS-2M) was performed to examine the influence of baseline viral, participant characteristics, dosing 
regimen,  and  post-baseline  plasma  drug  concentrations  on  CVF.  Four  covariates  were  significantly 
associated  (P<0.05  for  each  adjusted  odds  ratio)  with  increased  risk  of  CVF:  RPV-RAM  at  baseline 
identified  by  proviral  DNA  genotypic  assay,  HIV-1  subtype  A6/A1  (associated  with  integrase  L74I 
polymorphism),  Ct  RPV  at  4  weeks  following  initial  injection  dose,  BMI≥30  kg/m2  (associated  with 
cabotegravir pharmacokinetics). Other variables including Q4W or Q8W dosing, female gender, or other 
viral subtypes (non A6/A1) had no significant association with CVF. No baseline factor, when present in

isolation, was predictive of virologic failure. However, a combination of at least 2 of the following baseline 
factors  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  CVF:  rilpivirine  resistance  mutations,  HIV-1  subtype 
A6/A1, or BMI≥30 kg/m2 
Two different regimens have been tested during clinical development, the currently recommended Q4W 
regimen or a Q8W regimen. There is a notable difference between the proportion of subjects with CVF 
in the Q8W (1.74% and 1.34%, respectively) and Q4W arms (0% and 0.19%, respectively), in the two 
studies that investigated both regimens simultaneously (LATTE-2 and ATLAS-2M). Based upon the post-
hoc multivariable analysis presented, an increased risk of CVF is associated with the presence of two or 
more baseline factors of rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI≥30 kg/m2, rather 
than the Q4 vs Q8 Week dosing regimen in itself. The additional information on the risk factors for CVF 
has been incorporated in section 5.1 of the SmPC, which can be endorsed.    
It is uncertain whether patients will be sufficiently adherent to the visits schedule in real life, and what 
fraction  will  at  some  point  be  lost  to  follow-up  (either  for  a  short  period  of  time  or  longer).  If  not 
adequately treated with an appropriate oral ARV regimen, these patients will be at great risk of virologic 
failure, due to prolonged exposure to subtherapeutic levels of RPV and CAB, and subsequent resistance 
development. This should be clearly communicated to patients before they start treatment with these 
long-acting ARVs and reiterated at subsequent visits. The SAG experts considered adherence is a key 
element  and  should  be  reinforced,  however,  there  is  not  a  unique  tool  to  ensure  good  adherence  to 
treatment. Hence, measures should be adapted to the centres, resources, patients’ characteristics etc.  
The main issue in clinical practice will be the management of missed visits and discontinuation. Both CAB 
and  RPV  exposures  slowly  decrease  after  discontinuation,  and  the  long  period  during  which 
subtherapeutic  levels  of  CAB  and  RPV  are  present  poses  a  substantial  risk  of  resistance  development 
when patients are not adequately treated with an appropriate oral ARV regimen. 
A warning box in section 4.4 of the SmPC will state that to minimise the risk of developing viral 
resistance it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than 
one month after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed monthly and no later than two months after 
the final injection of Vocabria when dosed every 2 months.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
The overall programme including the data from CAB studies is considered adequate to support the 
efficacy and safety CAB in combination with RPV.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies 
Four Phase I/II studies were performed in HIV-1 infected subjects: 
- ITZ111451 and ITZ112929, assessing oral CAB in a 10 days monotherapy in ART-naïve and experienced 
(INI naïve) HIV-1 infected subjects who were not currently receiving ART. 
- LAI116482 (LATTE study), assessing 3 doses of oral CAB in combination with oral RPV in ART-naïve 
adults. 
- 200056 (LATTE-2 study), assessing 2 doses of CAB IM in combination with RPV IM in ART-naïve adults, 
after an oral induction phase. 
The dose-response studies ITZ112929 and ITZ111451 have assessed 10 days of monotherapy of CAB 5 
mg/day and CAB 30 mg/day in HIV-1 infected subjects. Overall, the antiviral activity of CAB vs placebo

was demonstrated, with mean change values from Baseline to Day 11 within the range of those observed 
with the other INI DTG and BIC:

Although the population of these both studies was not strictly comparable, there is a higher decrease of 
viral load from baseline with CAB 30 mg (difference treatment vs placebo: -2.865 log10 c/ml) than CAB 
5 mg (-2.090 log10 c/ml). 
Study LAI116482 (LATTE) was a Phase IIb, randomised, multicentre, parallel group, partially-blinded, 
two part study assessing in HIV-1 ART-naïve subjects 3 doses of oral CAB (10, 30 and 60 mg QD) in 
combination with 2 NRTIs during a 24 weeks induction phase, followed by a maintenance phase of CAB 
(10, 30 and 60 mg QD) + RPV 25 mg. The comparator was EFV + 2 NRTIs. A rapid virologic response 
(HIV–1 RNA <50 c/mL) was observed across all CAB plus NRTI treatment groups by the end of the 24 
week induction (CAB subtotal: 87% vs EFV: 74%) with a shorter time to virologic suppression for the 
CAB arms compared to EFV (each p<0.001).

Page 63/140 
 
 
 
 
Table 12
These results suggest that a bitherapy CAB + RPV seems effective to obtain and maintain a satisfying 
virologic suppression. Based on the Week 96 data, better results may be expected with CAB 30 mg or 
60 mg than with CAB 10 mg, although no statistically significant difference was raised between these 3 
CAB groups. However, a numerically higher rate of discontinuation due to AE is observed in the CAB 60 
mg arm vs the other CAB arms. PK data show that CAB exposure (AUC, Cmax and C0) is relatively dose-
proportional  between  10  mg  and  60  mg,  although  a  slight  less-than-proportional  increase  was 
highlighted between 30 mg and 60 mg with the intensive PK data. Considering these data, an oral CAB 
dose at 30 mg was selected. 
Study 200056 (LATTE-2) was a Phase IIb, randomised, multicentre, parallel group, open-label, three-
part study in HIV-1 infected ART-naive adults. In the Induction Period, subjects began an oral regimen 
of CAB 30 mg once daily plus ABC/3TC 600/300 mg once daily during 20 weeks (from Week -20 to Day 
1). Four weeks before the end of the Induction Period (i.e. from Week -4 to Day 1), their regimen was 
modified with the addition of RPV 25 mg once daily. All subjects with an undetectable HIV-1 RNA (<50 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 64/140 
 
 
 
 
 
c/mL) at the Week (-4) visit were eligible to enter the Maintenance Period. In the Maintenance Period, 
eligible subjects were randomised 2:2:1 to receive for 96 weeks (from Day 1 to Week 96) an IM Q4W 
regimen of CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg every 4 weeks (after a loading dose of CAB LA 800 mg + 
RPV LA 600 mg at Day 1), an IM Q8W regimen of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg every 8 weeks (after 
loading  doses  of  CAB  LA  800  mg  +  RPV  LA  900  mg  at  Day  1  and  CAB  LA  600  mg  at  Week  4),  or  to 
continue on the oral Induction Period regimen of CAB 30 mg + ABC/3TC once daily. These doses were 
selected  by  the  applicant  using  POPPK  simulations  and  considering  notably  a  mean  Ct  above  that 
obtained with oral CAB 10 mg once daily during treatment (CAB trough concentrations ≥1.35 µg/mL). 
The applicant considers that maintaining a target at approximately the level of the 30 mg oral dose is 
not needed in Maintenance, as viral suppression and short-term tolerability have been established during 
Induction. 
At Week 96, 94% (Q8W IM arm) and 87% (Q4W IM) of subjects receiving injectable dosing maintained 
virologic  suppression  (HIV-1  RNA  <50  c/mL)  compared  to  84%  of  subjects  continuing  oral  CAB  +  2 
NRTIs. 
Table 13
As regards the efficacy results of this Phase II study, both IM regimen provided high antiviral efficacy 
with few virologic failure. However, some differences between these two regimens may be highlighted: 
- Some cases of virologic failures were observed with the Q8W regimen vs no case of virologic failure in 
the Q4W regimen, suggesting that the Q8W regimen, with larger interval between each injection, may 
be suboptimal. This will be further explored in Phase III studies. 
- At Week 96, the Snapshot outcome of rate of discontinuations due to AEs was higher with the Q4W 
regimen (n=9, 8%) than the Q8W (n=1, <1%) or oral regimen (n=2, 4%). Moreover, these rates in 
each  group  did  not  strictly  match  with  the  proportions  of  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  described  in  the 
safety section (7.4) of the study report, which makes it difficult to assess these differences. In addition, 
this trend is maintained in the Week 160 analysis, where the Snapshot outcome of rate of discontinuation 
due to  AEs  is  considerably  higher in the  Q4W  regimen  (n=12,  10%) than  in  the  Q8W  regimen  (n=1, 
<1%). The applicant argues that the difference in rate of AEs that have led to withdrawal between the 
Q8W and the Q4W arm may be partially attributable to the additional visits experienced by subjects on 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 65/140 
 
 
 
 
 
the Q4W arm. While it is acknowledged that subjects in the Q4W arm have more injections and visits, it 
is not expected that this would be fully accountable for the observed different discontinuation rates. 
The list of these AEs at D160 did not highlight particular safety concern which could occur more frequently 
with  the  monthly  injections.  Overall,  phase  III  studies  did  not  point  towards  an  unacceptably  high 
discontinuation rate for the LA treatment.  
Overall,  based  on  the  results  of  the  Phase  II  studies  LATTE  and  LATTE-2,  the  applicant’s  decision  to 
continue the development of these two LA IM regimen in Phase III studies is acknowledged. 
Main studies 
The clinical efficacy of the dual maintenance regimen with cabotegravir LA  in combination with rilpivirine 
LA both administered every 4 weeks is based on the 48 weeks data from two large open label randomised 
controlled pivotal  Phase  III  switch  studies in  HIV-1  infected  subjects  (201584 [FLAIR  study,  N=566 ] 
and  201585  [ATLAS  study,  N=616  ]).  In  addition,  Weeks  48  data  from  an  additional  Phase  III  study 
(207966 [ATLAS-2M study]), comparing the 4W regimen versus an alternative 8W dose regimen, have 
been made available during the procedure in support of the additionally claimed Q8W regimen. 
Since the D120 AR, Week 96 results of ATLAS and FLAIR studies became available.  
Study 201584 (FLAIR study) 
Methods 
This is a Phase III, multi-phase, randomised, open label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group, 
non-inferiority study in HIV-1, ART-naïve adult subjects. 
Figure 7 FLAIR study  
Study Participants 
Included subjects were HIV-1 infected, ART-naive men or women aged 18 years or greater, with HIV-
1 RNA ≥1000 c/ml.  
Assessment report

Exclusion criteria included notably resistance to NNRTIs (except for K103N) or INI, pregnancy, active 
CDC stage 3 disease (except cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy or CD4+ cell 
count <200 cells/mm3), moderate to severe hepatic impairment, HBV infection (asymptomatic chronic 
HCV infection is allowed), creatinine clearance <50 ml/min, high risk of seizures, significant suicide risk 
and need for chronic anti-coagulation. 
Treatments 
Induction Phase: 
All subjects initiated a treatment with ABC/DTG/3TC (or DTG + the alternative non-abacavir backbone 
for subjects HLA-b5701 positive) for 20 weeks. 
Maintenance Phase: 
Subjects were randomised to receive either: 
- oral CAR (ABC/DTG/3TC or DTG + the alternative non-abacavir backbone) for at least 100 Weeks, or 
- oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks during OLI followed by IM injections 
of CAB + RPV (IM CAB 600 mg + RPV 900 mg at Week 4, IM CAB 400 mg + RPV 600 mg at Week 8 and 
every 4 weeks thereafter) for at least 94 Weeks. 
In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  address  pre-planned  missed  IM  CAB  +  RPV  dosing  visits,  following 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, Investigators could provide daily oral CAB 30 mg and RPV 25 mg 
as  a  short-term  “bridging”  strategy  for  subjects  who  had  begun  CAB  +  RPV  and  who  would  miss  a 
subsequent  scheduled  IM  CAB  +  RPV  injection.  In  certain  circumstances  (e.g.,  prior  to  steady  state 
dosing and following a >4-week oral bridge) repeating the loading doses of IM CAB and RPV could be 
required. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to IM CAB + RPV 
every 4 weeks compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks in HIV 1 antiretroviral naïve subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  is  the  pproportion  of  subjects  with  a  “virologic  failure”  endpoint  as  per  FDA 
Snapshot algorithm at Week 48 (ITT-E Population). Virologic failure is defined as any of the following: 
- Non-response as indicated by a less than a 1.0 log10 copies/mL decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA after 4 
weeks of starting the Induction Phase, which is subsequently confirmed, unless the plasma HIV-1 RNA 
is < 400 c/mL (Induction Phase criteria). 
-  Rebound  as  indicated  by  two  consecutive  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  that  are  >  0.5  log10  c/mL  increase  in 
plasma  HIV-1  RNA  from  the  nadir  value  on  study,  where  the  lowest  HIV-1  RNA  value  is  ≥  200  c/mL 
(Induction Phase criteria). 
- Rebound as indicated by two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 200 c/mL after prior suppression 
to < 200 c/mL.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomisation 1:1 was stratified by subject’s Induction Baseline (Week -20) HIV-1 RNA (<100,000, 
≥100,000 c/mL) and sex at birth. 
This study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
As  this  study  (201584)  and  study  201585  were  not  sufficiently  powered  individually  to  rule  out  4% 
virologic  failure  in  excess,  a  6%  margin  chosen  in  each  study  can  be  viewed  as  defining  criteria  for 
assessing the consistency acceptability of the study-specific results prior to integration of the studies in 
the pooled analysis, where a more stringent 4% margin is applied. 
This study planned to randomise approximately 285 subjects per treatment group. Assuming the true 
proportion of subjects with Snapshot HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL was 3% for the CAB + RPV treatment group 
and 2% for the CAR group, a non-inferiority margin of 6%, and a 2.5% 1-sided significance level, this 
provided approximately 97% power to show non-inferiority for the proportion of subjects with Snapshot 
HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at Week 48.

Table 14 Summary of Subject accountability: Maintenance Phase conclusion Record ( ITT-E 
Population)  
During the Maintenance Phase, 9 subjects (3%) used oral bridging ranging from 4 to 61 days in duration 
to cover missed or delayed injection visits. The majority of subjects were able to resume CAB LA + RPV 
LA dosing. No cases of CVF or virologic blips were observed during the period of oral bridging or following 
resumption of CAB + RPV dosing. 
Conduct of the study 
Two quality issues impacting the efficacy data occurred throughout the study: 
First,  a  quality  issue  at  central laboratory  was  identified  (Abbott  HIV-1  Realtime  assay  contamination 
from April to June 2018). This contamination has caused false-positive results with HIV-1 RNA samples, 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 69/140 
 
 
 
 
and therefore assay failures for Abbott Realtime assay runs, on 20, 23 and 24 April 2018. The samples 
tested between 15 and 26 April 2018 (i.e. determined to be within the period of potential contamination 
risk)  with  reported  HIV-1  RNA  results  of  ≥50  c/mL  were  retested  in  another  laboratory  using  frozen 
plasma backup samples; results with a difference of more than 0.5 log copies/mL from the original result 
were updated with the retest result. No impact on subject safety or data integrity was incurred. There 
was 1 subject sample which fit the above retesting criteria. The retest result for this subject was <0.5 
log copies/mL. 
Secondly,  another  assay  quality  issue  was  reported  regarding  the  Abbott  RealTime  HIV-1  RNA  Assay 
(recall of certain lots of the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay reagent, which was used to measure plasma 
HIV-1 RNA in this study). This quality issue caused a lack of precision in the lower end of the assay’s 
quantification range, and results that were <40 c/mL using only these impacted lots were considered 
unreliable. Abbott Laboratories recommended that samples that were assayed using the impacted lots 
and with results <40 c/mL be retested. Results that were ≥40 c/mL using the same lots were not affected 
by this issue. Of 164 samples retested, 13 samples had a change in outcome in which HIV-1 RNA was 
≥50 c/mL. There was one sample from Maintenance Phase (Day 1) with discordant results original HIV-
1 RNA <50 c/mL, retest 58 c/mL). This subject remains on study and was fully suppressed <50 c/mL. 
Six sample discrepancies occurring at the Week -4 visit. A retest for HIV-1 RNA was required to determine 
if these subjects could continue into the Maintenance Phase of the study. Of the 6 subjects with HIV-1 
RNA >50 c/mL at Week -4, 2 were excluded from the Per Protocol analyses, as the Day 1 HIV-1 RNA 
remained >50 c/mL (the other 4 subjects were not excluded as the Day 1 HIV-1 RNA was <50 c/mL). 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups. Although the majority of 
subjects were male, the study exceeded the goal to enroll at least 20% female subjects. Most subjects 
were aged 18 to <50 years of age (88%) with a median (range) of 34 (18 to 68) years. The predominant 
race was White-White/Caucasian/European heritage.

Table 15 Demographic characteristics  
At  Induction  Baseline  (Week  -20),  the  viral  load  and  prevalence  of  each  HIV-1  subtype  was  similar 
between treatment groups, with 20% of subjects with HIV-1 RNA >100.000 c/ml and respectively 61% 
and 15% of subjects with HIV-1 subtype B and A. The frequencies of current and past medical conditions, 
the  HIV  risk  factors  and  the  baseline  cardiovascular  risk  assessments  were  similar  in  both  treatment 
groups. As regards hepatitis status, 18 (6%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 9 (3%) subjects in 
the CAR group were tested positive for HCV only. One additional subject in the CAB + RPV group was 
tested positive for HBV and HCV.

Table 18
The proportion of subjects with confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 Consecutive Plasma HIV-1 RNA Levels 
≥200 c/mL After Prior Suppression to <200 c/mL) at Week 48 in the CAB + RPV group was 1.4% (4 
subjects) and in the CAR group was 1.1% (3 subjects) through Week 48. 
At  Week  48,  median  (IQR)  increases  from  Day  1  to  Week  48  in  CD4+  cell  counts  of  45.5  (-60,  141) 
cells/mm3 for CAB + RPV and 80.0 (-32, 193) cells/mm3 for CAR were observed. The mean and median 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio through Week 48 was similar in both treatment groups. 
Considering the rate of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/ml and the rate of subjects with CVF at Week 48, 
and the applicant’s choice of a 6% non-inferiority margin, the switch from oral DTG+2 NRTIs to CAB+RPV 
LA IM in virologically-suppressed subjects is non-inferior to the oral regimen. The other efficacy endpoints 
and the PP analysis confirm the non-inferiority. Although the 6% non-inferiority margin is debatable, the 
non-inferiority is still demonstrated with a 4% margin. 
Week 96 
At Week 96, 3.2% of subjects in each group (CAB + RPV group and CAR group) had viral load ≥50 c/mL 
(both ITT-E and PP Populations).  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroups analyses 
There were no statistically significant differences in treatment effect for each randomisation stratification

Of note, antiviral efficacy is numerically lower with CAB+RPV LA IM than oral CAR at Week 48 in obese 
subjects (BMI ≥30) (rate of virologic failure: 3/40 [7.5%] vs 0/37) and in HIV subtypes A1 and AG (and 
in general in subtype A) (pooled rate of virologic failure: 4/18 [22.2%] vs 1/20 [5%]). 
Resistance analyses 
The rate of clinical virologic failure is low, with 4 and 3 subjects respectively in the CAB+RPV arm and 
CAR arm through Week 48. In the CAB+RPV group, 3 subjects had subtype A1 and came from Russia 
sites. The fourth subject had an oral CAB +RPV treatment interruption at Week 4a (result of positive 
pregnancy test later confirmed as false) and never received any CAB + RPV injections. Among the 3 CVF 
subjects in the CAR group, none of whom had any treatment emergent NRTI or INI RAMs. From Week 
48 to Week 96, there was one additional clinical virologic failure in each group; one occurred at week 48 
in the randomised CAB/RPV LA arm and one occurred at week 64 in a subject on the CAR arm.

consultation with the Medical Monitor, Investigators could provide daily oral CAB 30 mg and RPV 25 mg 
as  a  short-term  “bridging”  strategy  for  subjects  who  had  begun  CAB  +  RPV  and  who  would  miss  a 
subsequent  scheduled  IM  CAB  +  RPV  injection.  In  certain  circumstances  (e.g.,  prior  to  steady  state 
dosing and following a >4-week oral bridge) repeating the loading doses of IM CAB and RPV could be 
required. 
The CAR included 2 NRTIs plus: 
- INI with the exception of ABC/DTG/3TC (either the initial or second CAR regimen); 
- NNRTI (either the initial or second CAR regimen); 
- Boosted PI (or atazanavir [ATV] unboosted) (had to be either the initial CAR regimen or 1 historical 
within-class switch was permitted due to safety/tolerability). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to intramuscular CAB 
+ RPV compared to continuation of current first line antiretroviral regimen (CAR) over 48 weeks in 
HIV-1 infected ART-experienced subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who met the Snapshot virologic failure criteria, 
defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL, at Week 48. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomisation 1:1 was stratified by baseline third agent class (PI, INI, or NNRTI), and sex at birth. 
This study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
As  this  study  (201585)  and  study  201584  were  not  sufficiently  powered  individually  to  rule  out  4% 
virologic  failure  in  excess,  a  6%  margin  chosen  in  each  study  can  be  viewed  as  defining  criteria  for 
assessing the consistency acceptability of the study-specific results prior to integration of the studies in 
the pooled analysis, where a more stringent 4% margin is applied. 
This study planned to randomise approximately 285 subjects per treatment group. Assuming the true 
proportion of subjects with Snapshot HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL was 3% for the CAB + RPV treatment group 
and 2% for the CAR group, a non-inferiority margin of 6%, and a 2.5% 1-sided significance level, this 
provided approximately 97% power to show non-inferiority for the proportion of subjects with Snapshot 
HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at Week 48.

7 subjects (2%) used oral bridging ranging from 4 to 29 days in duration to cover missed or delayed 
injection  visits.  Each  subject  who  utilised  oral  bridging  retained  virologic  suppression  during  the  oral 
bridging period and for subsequent study visits through the current reporting period. 
Conduct of the study 
Two quality issues impacting the efficacy data occurred throughout the study: 
First,  a  quality  issue  at  central laboratory  was  identified  (Abbott  HIV-1  Realtime  assay  contamination 
from April to June 2018). This contamination has caused false-positive results with HIV-1 RNA samples, 
and therefore assay failures for Abbott Realtime assay runs, on 20, 23 and 24 April 2018. The samples 
tested between 15 and 26 April 2018 (i.e., determined to be within the period of potential contamination 
risk)  with  reported  HIV-1  RNA  results  of  ≥50  c/mL  were  retested  in  another  laboratory  using  frozen 
plasma backup samples; results with a difference of more than 0.5 log copies/mL from the original result 
were updated with the retest result. No impact on subject safety or data integrity was incurred. There 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 79/140 
 
 
 
 
were 2 subject samples which fit the above retesting criteria (see below results of Subject A at week 48 
and Subject B at week 60).  
Secondly,  another  assay  quality  issue  was  reported  regarding  the  Abbott  RealTime  HIV-1  RNA  Assay 
(recall of certain lots of the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay reagent, which was used to measure plasma 
HIV-1 RNA in this study). This quality issue caused a lack of precision in the lower end of the assay’s 
quantification range, and results that were <40 c/mL using only these impacted lots were considered 
unreliable. Abbott Laboratories recommended that samples that were assayed using the impacted lots 
and with results <40 c/mL be retested. Results that were ≥40 c/mL using the same lots were not affected 
by this issue. Of 268 samples retested, only one subject had a change in outcome original HIV-1 RNA 
<40 c/mL at Week 4, retest 70 c/mL). This subject continues in the Extension Phase of the study and 
remains fully suppressed <50 c/mL). 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups (at the exception of the 
rate of subjects above 50 years old (21% in CAB+RPV group vs 31% in CAR group): 
Table 21 Demographic Characteristic 
The distribution of CD4+ cell counts at Baseline was comparable in both treatment groups, with 74% of 
subjects with baseline CD4 above 500 cells/mm3. HIV risk factors were similar in both treatment groups. 
The  historic  of  antiretroviral  therapy  at  screening  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups,  in  terms  of 
duration (≈ 65 months) and nature of antiretroviral therapy (NRTIs + PI: 17%, NRTIs + NNRTI: 50%, 
NRTIs + INI: 33%).

Overall, the population of this ATLAS study is more diversified than those in FLAIR study, with higher 
and significant proportions of women (>30%), subjects above 50 years old (20-30%) and heterosexual 
contact (45%) than in FLAIR study. However, subjects were less immunocompromised in this study (8% 
of subjects with CD4 levels <350 cells/mm3) than in FLAIR study (30%).

Table 24 
The proportion of subjects with CVF in the CAB + RPV group was 1.0% (3 subjects) and in the CAR 
group was 1.3% (4 subjects) through Week 48. The treatment difference (95% CI) in the Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of the proportion without efficacy related discontinuation was 0.3% (-1.4%, 2.0%). 
Median (range) increases from Day 1 at Week 48 in CD4+ cell counts of 4.0 (-536 to 801) cells/mm3 
for CAB + RPV and of 13.5 (-1043 to 521) cells/mm3 for CAR were observed. The mean and median 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio through Week 48 was similar in both treatment groups. 
Considering the rate of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/ml and the rate of subjects with CVF at Week 
48, and the applicant’s choice of a 6% non-inferiority margin, the switch from an effective oral 
tritherapy to CAB+RPV LA IM Q4W in virologically-suppressed subjects is non-inferior to the pursue of 
Assessment report

the oral regimen. The other efficacy endpoints and the PP analysis confirm the non-inferiority. Although 
the 6% non-inferiority margin is debatable, the non-inferiority is still demonstrated with a 4% margin. 
Week 96: 
At  Week  96,  51  subjects  remained  ongoing  in  the  Extension  Phase.  Numbers  of  subjects  in  each 
treatment  group  changed  throughout  the  Extension  Phase  primarily  due  to  transitioning  to  Study 
207966: 
Table 25 Subject disposition at Week 96 
At Week 96, 23/23 (100%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group had viral load <50 c/mL and 28/29 (97%) 
subjects in the Extension Switch to CAB + RPV group had viral load <50 c/mL. No additional subjects 
had CVF during the Extension Phase between Week 48 and Week 96 endpoints in either treatment group.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroups analyses 
There were no statistically significant differences in treatment effect for each randomisation 
stratification factor and in any Baseline or demographic subgroup examined:

Resistance analyses 
The rates of CVF were low in both treatment groups through Week 48: 3 subjects in the CAB + RPV 
group and 4 subjects in the CAR group. Similar to FLAIR study, the 3 cases of confirmed virologic 
failure under CAB+RPV IM regimen with treatment emergence of RPV and/or CAB resistance had 
subtype A, and two of them came from Russia (the third came from France). 
Health outcomes 
At Week 48, subjects on the CAB + RPV group reported a substantial improvement in overall treatment 
satisfaction with CAB + RPV compared with their daily oral treatment at study entry (scoring a mean of 
29 points from a maximum of 33 points).  
Perception of injection (PIN) data suggest that subjects’ acceptability of the injectable monthly dosing 
of CAB + RPV and the amount of bother experienced from ISRs improved over time from Week 5 up to 
Week 48.

Methods 
This is a Phase III, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group, non-
inferiority study in HIV-1, virologically-suppressed adult subjects. This was a multicentre study 
conducted in 13 countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Republic of Korea, 
Mexico, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and United States. 
The majority of subjects were enrolled from the ongoing 201585 Study (ATLAS study) with additional 
subjects on standard of care (SOC). Eligible subjects were randomised (1:1) to receive either CAB + 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 85/140 
 
 
 
 
 
RPV Q8W or CAB + RPV Q4W for at least 100 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by prior CAB + RPV 
exposure (0 weeks, 1-24 weeks, >24 weeks).  
Two groups of subjects were randomised:  
- Group 1: Subjects randomised from current ART SOC therapy, including those enrolled to the CAR 
arm of Study 201585 (following completion of the Week 52 visit at minimum), received oral therapy 
with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily at Baseline for 28 days (±3 days) followed by IM CAB + RPV 
Q8W or IM CAB + RPV Q4W thereafter. 
- Group 2: Subjects entering Study 207966 from Study 201585 and currently receiving IM CAB + RPV 
Q4W were randomised 1:1 to either continue IM CAB + RPV Q4W or transition to IM CAB + RPV Q8W. 
The IM CAB + RPV Q4W regimen consists in IM CAB 400 mg + RPV 600 mg every 4 weeks.  
The IM CAB + RPV Q8W regimen consists in IM CAB 600 mg + RPV 900 mg every 8 weeks.

Results 
Since the D120 AR, the Week 48 results became available. At the time of the data cut for this 48 Week 
data summary, the number of subjects ongoing in the Maintenance Phase was similar in both treatment 
groups (Q8W: 486 subjects [93%]; Q4W: 481 subjects [92%]).

Demographic characteristics were generally similar between the 2 treatment groups.  
At  Week  48,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  ≥50  c/ml  (Snapshot  Algorithm)  was 
similar between treatment groups, with the upper bound of 95% CI for the adjusted treatment difference

between  Q8W  and  Q4W  less  than  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  of  4%.  Results  for  the  PP 
population were similar to those for the ITT-E Population. 
Table 30
Nevertheless,  more  subjects  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  Q8W group  (Q8W:  6  [1.1%]; 
Q4W:  2  [0.4%])  while  less  subjects  in  this  group  had  no  virologic  data  (Q8W:  21  [4.0%];  Q4W:  29 
[5.5%] due to fewer discontinuations related to AE, death, or for other reasons. 
Table 31
According  to  the  randomisation  strata  (prior  exposure  to  CAB  +  RPV),  the  test  of  evidence  against 
homogeneity of the treatment difference was not statistically significant for prior exposure to CAB + RPV 
(p=0.346). However, the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at Week 48 is higher 
for subjects with prior exposure to CAB + RPV between 1 to 24 weeks but is similar between both groups 
for subjects without prior exposure to CAB + RPV or with prior exposure > 24 weeks.

The proportion of Snapshot virologic failures was numerically higher in the Q8W arm compared with the 
Q4W  arm  in  female  subjects  (5/137  [3.6%]  and  0/143  [0%]  in  females  vs  4/385  [1.0%]  and  5/380 
[1.3%] in males, respectively) and in subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (6/113 [5.3%] in the Q8W group 
and 2/98 [2.0%] in the Q4W group for BMI ≥30 kg/m2 vs 3/409 [0.7%] in the Q8W group and 3/425 
[0.7%] in the Q4W group for BMI <30 kg/m2). 
The proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 was similar for both treatment 
groups: 
Table 33 
Mean and median CD4+ cell counts remained stable from Baseline in both treatment groups over time. 
Mean  and  median  change  from  Baseline  in  CD4+  cell  counts  were  similar  between  treatment  groups 
when analysed by subgroups. 
The CAB and RPV Cmin measured in these subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/ml are comparable to the 
values for the overall population matched for strata of prior exposure at that same visit and includes 
identification of subjects with RAMs.

In  comparison  to  the  CAB  and  RPV  Cmin  measured  in  subjects  with  virologic  success,  no  suboptimal 
exposition of CAB and RPV seems associated with these virologic failures. 
Resistance analyses 
Confirmed virologic failure (CVF) was defined by 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥200 c/mL after 
prior  suppression  to  <200  c/mL.  CVF  up  to  Week  48  was  uncommon  with  10  subjects  meeting  CVF 
criteria: 8 subjects (1.5%) in the Q8W arm and 2 subjects (0.4%) in the Q4W arm. Eight subjects met 
CVF criteria at or before the Week 24 timepoint.

Table 35
NNRTI RAM and INI RAM were present at baseline for respectively 6 and 5 subjects in the Q8W group, 
and 1 and 0 subject in the Q4W group. This could explain the higher number of CVF subjects in the Q8W 
group.  
The NNRTI and INSTI RAM that have emerged from baseline to the SVF timepoint were K101E (n=3), 
E138E/K  (n=1),  V179V/I  (n=1)  and  M230L  (n=1)  for  NNRTI  RAM,  and  Q148Q/R  or  Q148R  (n=4), 
N155N/H or N155H (n=5) and E138E/K (n=1) for INI RAM. These RAM are known to be associated with 
decreased RPV or CAB susceptibility.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled data 
A pool of the pivotal Phase 3 results was performed: 
Table 36
Table 37
For the pooled analysis, CVF rates for both the CAB + RPV arm and the CAR group was 7/591 (1.2%). 
The rates of virological failure are low and similar between both studies, which is consistent with their 
similar population. The pooled analysis confirms the non-inferiority of once-monthly CAB + RPV vs the 
continuation of an effective ARV regimen, considering a 4% non-inferiority margin. 
Post-hoc analysis 
A multivariable logistic regression analysis of pooled phase 3 studies (ATLAS, FLAIR and ATLAS-2M) was 
performed to examine the influence of baseline viral load, participant characteristics, dosing regimen,

and post-baseline plasma drug concentrations on confirmed virologic failure (CVF). This analysis included 
data from 1039 HIV-infected adults with no prior exposure to CAB+RPV, including 13 subjects 1.25%) 
with CVF at Week 48. 
Four covariates were significantly associated (P<0.05 for each adjusted odds ratio) with increased risk 
of  CVF:  RPV-RAM  at  baseline  identified  by  proviral  DNA  genotypic  assay,  HIV-1  subtype  A6/A1 
(associated with integrase L74I polymorphism), Ct RPV at 4 weeks following initial injection dose, BMI≥30 
kg/m2 (associated with cabotegravir pharmacokinetics). Other variables including Q4W or Q8W dosing, 
female gender, or other viral subtypes (non A6/A1) had no significant association with CVF. 
No baseline factor, when present in isolation, was predictive of virologic failure. However, a combination 
of at least 2 of the following baseline factors was associated with an increased risk of CVF: rilpivirine 
resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI≥30 kg/m2: 
Since the applicant originally only claimed a Q4W regimen this study was considered supportive, it is 
now viewed as pivotal in support of the Q8W regimen newly claimed within the timeframe of the 
procedure. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose selection 
The doses of CAB and RPV were selected based on the Phase II studies (LATTE study for oral CAB and 
RPV, and LATTE-2 study for CAB LA and RPV LA). 
Data from LATTE study suggest that an oral bitherapy CAB + RPV seems effective to obtain and maintain 
an adequate virologic suppression. Based on the Week 96 data, better results may be expected with CAB 
30  mg  or  60  mg  than  with  CAB  10  mg,  although  no  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed 
between these 3 CAB groups. However, a numerically higher rate of discontinuation due to AE is observed 
in the CAB 60 mg arm vs the other CAB arms. PK data have shown a relatively dose-proportional CAB 
exposure  (AUC,  Cmax  and  C0)  between  10  mg  and  60  mg,  although  a  slight  less-than-proportional 
increase was highlighted between 30 mg and 60 mg. Therefore, the selection of an oral CAB dose at 30 
mg is endorsed and was approved in EMA Scientific Advice. 
For the IM LA formulations of CAB and RPV, dose regimen were selected by the applicant using POPPK 
simulations and taking in to account i) the ability to reach target concentration early in treatment, ii) the 
ability to maintain mean Cτ above that obtained with oral CAB 10 mg once daily during treatment (CAB 
trough  concentrations  ≥1.35  µg/mL),  and  iii)  the  lower  total  number  of  injections  per  visit.  This  is 
endorsed,  although  a  higher  PK  target,  corresponding  to  Cτ  with  oral  CAB  30  mg,  could  have  been 
considered. However, the applicant considers that maintaining a target at approximately the level of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 95/140 
 
 
 
 
30 mg oral dose is not needed in Maintenance, as viral suppression and short-term tolerability have been 
established during Induction.  
The  selected  IM  dose  regimen  (Q4W  and  Q8W)  were  then  tested  and  supported  in  study  LATTE-2. 
According to the EMA Scientific advice, the applicant has firstly selected the Q4W dose regimen for the 
Phase 3 studies and the MA application.  
Since the D120 AR, the alternative Q8W dose regimen was added to the proposed posology, given that 
the Week 48 results of the Phase 3 study ATLAS-2M are now available. With this Q8W regimen, a 20 to 
40% decrease of CAB/RPV predose concentrations are observed in comparison to the Q4W regimen. As 
regards  CAB  exposure,  the  lower  concentrations  measured  ( ≈ 1.3  µg/ml)  are  equivalent  to  those 
measured in the oral CAB 10 mg group in the Phase 2 study LAI116482. Reassuringly, the virological 
impact in this group was similar to that in the CAB 30 mg group (i.e. the recommended posology of oral 
CAB tablets). Furthermore, this CAB Ct is approximately 8-fold above the protein adjusted IC90 (CAB 
PA-IC90 ≈ 0.16 µg/ml).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  Phase  3  studies,  FLAIR  and  ATLAS  studies,  were  designed  and  powered  to  statistically 
demonstrate the non-inferiority of the CAB+RPV strategy (i.e. oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg QD during 
1 month, followed by injection of IM CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg, and then IM CAB LA 400 mg + 
RPV LA 600 mg every 4 weeks thereafter) for switch from current oral antiretroviral regimen (CAR) in 
virologically-suppressed subjects. These studies were broadly similar in terms of design and objective 
(both studies assessing the rate of virological failure after 48 weeks of switch). Their open label design 
is  endorsed  since  the  use  of  placebo  (notable  placebo  injections)  would  increase  the  risk  of  non-
adherence and bias the evaluation and the potential interest of the monthly injections of ART. It is noted 
that  the  applicant  has  defined  a  virologic  failure  with  a  limit  HIV-1  RNA  value  at  200  c/ml,  but  the 
standard criteria “confirmed viral load ≥50 c/ml” is also to be considered for a robust efficacy analysis. 
The studies were open-label, which is considered acceptable given that the pharmaceutical form 
(suspension for injection) is not considered appropriate for a double-dummy design. The primary 
endpoint is an objective measurement (based on plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement), which will not be 
influenced by the open-label design.  
The design of each open label randomised pivotal FLAIR and ATLAS studies, the pooling of these studies 
results, the non-inferiority margin of the individual studies (6%) and of the pooled studies (4% pooling 
enabling a more reliable efficacy estimate) were agreed by the EMA scientific advices.  
These studies were well performed, although some protocol deviations (including GCP non-compliance 
in one site and quality issues on the HIV-1 assay (see GCP comments above) were observed throughout 
these studies. As regards the HIV-1 assay contamination, the applicant’s explanation on the origins of 
this contamination, and its strategy to retest the positive samples during the contamination window, are 
acceptable. The robustness and integrity of the efficacy data could be considered preserved. In FLAIR 
study, a higher number of protocol deviations with the CAB+RPV IM regimen in comparison to the CAR 
regimen may suggest that this new injectable form of ART may be challenging to manage, with more 
requirements  than  a  standard  daily  oral  ART  regimen,  notably  for  the  compliance  of  the  monthly 
administrations and the study procedures associated with this treatment. 
Patient population  
A  total  of  1182  patients  were  included  and  treated  within  these  Phase  3  studies  (591  patients  with 
CAB+RPV and 591 comparative patients with their current oral ARV regimen), conferring an adequate 
power for the interpretation of efficacy data. In both studies, baseline characteristics (notably CD4 level, 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 96/140 
 
 
 
HIV subtype, CDC stage, HIV risk factor and medical conditions) were well balanced between both arms. 
The included population is mainly represented by asymptomatic Caucasian MSM without immunologic 
deficiency, although it is noted that efforts were made to include a significant proportion of women (25-
30%), in comparison to the last clinical studies in HIV medicines. However, the proportion of subjects 
with  low  CD4  levels  (<350  cells/mm3) is  low  (<10%),  and  African  people is  poorly  represented,  with 
only  few  centres  in  South  Africa  in  both  studies.  Finally,  according  to  their  exclusion  criteria,  studies 
participants should not have any evidence of primary resistance to NNRTIs (except for K103N which is 
allowed), or any known resistance to INIs from historical resistance test results, which should be reflected 
in the indication in Vocabria SmPC. Of note, prior to randomisation, subjects were stably suppressed for 
at least 6 months in ATLAS study, while it was for a median of 16.10 weeks in FLAIR study. 
A particularity of this procedure is to propose an oral formulation of CAB and RPV to i) assess tolerability 
of this bitherapy before starting the long acting formulations, and ii) ensure the continuity of treatment 
with  an  oral  bridging  in  case  of  missing  injection.  For  this  last  indication,  very  few  efficacy  data  are 
available (only 8 missed injections with oral bridging across studies).  
In addition to these two pivotal studies, the applicant has submitted data from a pooled analysis of these 
studies and from an ongoing Phase 3 study (ATLAS 2M) comparing the current monthly regimen (Q4W) 
with an every 2 months regimen (Q8W). The pooling of the pivotal studies is endorsed given the included 
population and similar design of these studies. ATLAS 2M study was performed to assess an alternative 
dose regimen with larger intervals between each injections (CAB 600 mg + RPV 900 mg every 8 weeks). 
While a debatable 6% non-inferiority margin was selected for ATLAS and FLAIR versus combined ARV, a 
reduced non inferiority margin of 4% is selected for this study comparing two schedules regimen of the 
combination CAB+RPV LA, which is endorsed.  
Additionally,  the  combination  of  CAB+RPV  IM  is  also  currently  developed  in  parallel  for  a  future  PrEP 
indication, but data were not available nor required for this current MA application. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Q4W regimen 
According to the efficacy endpoints in studies FLAIR and ATLAS, the bitherapy CAB+RPV Q4W (i.e. oral 
doses during 1 month then monthly IM administrations) is non-inferior to a standard tritherapy (2 NRTI 
+ 1 PI/NNRTI or INI) in virologically-suppressed subjects. Few cases of virological failure were observed 
throughout these studies, in both treatment arms. The difference in the percentages of patients with loss 
of virologic suppression (HIV RNA >50 copies/ml) at 48 weeks (pooling data of studies FLAIR and ATLAS) 
was 0.2 (95% CI: -1.4, 1.7), with results well below the pre-defined 4% non-inferiority margin and with 
consistency on the ITT and PP analyses. 
However, when focusing on subgroup analysis, concerns may be raised on some subgroups of subjects: 
- In both studies, the rate of virological failure was numerically higher in women treated by CAB+RPV 
than  with  the  current  oral  ARV  regimen  (CAR)  (pooled  results:  5/162  vs  1/168  in  women  treated  by 
CAB+RPV and CAR, respectively). This discrepancy was not observed with male subjects. In addition, in 
the pop PK modelling, categorisation of Cmin-LD by gender showed that the median was lower in females 
than males by 31%. However, the number of CVF cases remains low and consistent with the other switch 
studies for HIV medicines. Therefore, a gender effect of CAB+RPV seems unlikely but cannot be excluded. 
-  A  trend  of  higher  rate  of  virological  failure  with  CAB+RPV  is  observed  in  subjects  with  BMI  ≥30:  in 
FLAIR study, 3 subjects/40 treated with CAB+RPV experienced virological failure, vs 0 subject/37 treated 
with CAR. Data according to BMI in ATLAS study were not provided in the CSR, but this trend is recovered 
in the pooled analysis. No conclusion can be raised given the low number of subjects in these subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 97/140 
 
 
 
In addition, the PKPOP analysis has shown that subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 had 31% lower median 
Cmin-LD than those with BMI <30 kg/m2. When considered the subgroups BMI and gender, the trend 
of rate of virological failure with CAB+RPV is observed only in the subgroup of women with BMI ≥30, 
which could traduce a mixed gender and PK effect. Of note, based on the difference between individual 
observed  and  predicted  CAB  Ct,  female  and  BMI  ≥30  were  not  associated  to  a  higher  within-subject 
variability, and the hypothesis that misplaced injections are more frequent in patients with a high BMI 
value and consequently leads to higher risk of virological failure is not supported by this PK analysis.  
-  In  the  pooled  analysis,  an  efficacy  concern  could  also  be  raised  in  Russian  subjects,  with  an  over 
representation  of  Russian  subjects  among  the  patients  who  experienced  a  virological  failure  in  the 
CAB+RPV group (6/101 Russian subjects [6%]) in comparison to the CAR group (2/98 Russian subjects 
[2%]). All Russian subjects came from different study centres, which rules out the hypothesis of a clinical 
practice problem, but all had HIV-1 subtype A (A1 or AG). However, the in vitro activity of CAB and RPV 
in the subtype A did not differ to the other HIV-1 subtypes. Therefore, there may be external factors, 
notably  the  circulation  of  HIV  variants  with  certain viral  mutations  (such  as  L74I),  that  may  have  an 
impact on outcome in Russian subjects.  
Q8W regimen 
Based on ATLAS-2M study, the Q8W regimen (i.e. CAB/RPV 600/900 mg IM every two months) is non 
inferior to Q4W (monthly injections) regimen, both regimens being overall associated with a low rate of 
virologic failure (<2%). These results are consistent with data from FLAIR and ATLAS studies.  
Although non inferiority has been established between the Q4W and Q8W regimen in the ATLAS2M study, 
it is unclear at this stage to what extent both regimens could be regarded as equally appropriate and 
therefore being both equally proposed in section 4.2 as currently claimed by the applicant.  
Indeed, first the amount of data in support of the Q4W is significantly higher as compared to that for the 
Q8W.  
The rate of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/ml at Week 48, and especially the rate of confirmed virologic 
failure (CVF), is numerically higher in the Q8W group (8 subjects) than in the Q4W group (2 subjects).

Moreover,  the  CAB  exposure  with  the  Q8W  regimen  may  be  considered  borderline.  Based  on  model 
prediction, the Q4W dose regimen was predicted to induce CAB exposure above the target of 1.35 µg/mL 
after  ~1  year  of  treatment  in  99.6%  of  subjects,  while  this  would  be  84%  of  subjects  with  the  Q8W 
regimen. 
In the Q8W regimen, most of the CVF (7/8) have occurred during the first 24 weeks of treatment. In 
addition, most of subjects experiencing CVF had no prior exposure to CAB + RPV, with a somewhat lower 
Cmin  exposures  during  the  first  months  of  therapy  with  this  Q8W  regimen.  This  could  suggest  an 
inadequate CAB and/or RPV exposure at the beginning of treatment or differential resistance pattern at 
baseline.  
The applicant argues that the Q8W regimen and the Q4W regimen are equally effective.  The SAG 
input was requested on how they view the level of evidence in support of the Q8W, the SAG experts 
were confident that both regimens could be equally considered for the management of patients based 
on the clinical demonstration available (see SAG minutes). 
In order to identify pejorative risk factors for CVF the applicant has performed multivariable analyses 
of pooled phase 3 studies (ATLAS, FLAIR and ATLAS-2M), including data from 1039 HIV-infected adults 
with no prior exposure to CAB+RPV. Through Week 48 in these studies, 13/1039 (1.25%) participants 
had CVF while receiving cabotegravir and rilpivirine. Albeit having some limitations resulting from the 
few CVF to substantiate correlations, based on the multivariable analyses the applicant has identified 
that the Q8W regimen might not be optimal in patients having cumulative risk factors of virologic 
failure, i.e. at least 2 of the following baseline factors: rilpivirine resistance mutations identified by 
proviral resistance testing, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI>30 mg/m2. According to the SAG, the 
prescribers must be informed throughout a warning in the SmPC that such baseline factors may have 
an impact on the virologic response to CAB+RPV, in order to select candidates for dual LA Q8W 
regimen with further minimisation of the risk of virologic failure. These points have been introduced 
along the SmPC ( 4.2, 4.4, 5.1).

Additional expert consultation 
A SAG meeting was held September 8 for the Vocabria and Rekambys parallel applications. The 
following, identical questions were asked to the SAG members for both applications  and are presented 
with the (preliminary) answers by the experts. The outcome of the SAG was adopted during the 
September 2020 CHMP meeting. 
1.-To what extent do the SAG experts consider that the level of evidence supports the 
applicant claim that both the Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens could be equally 
proposed in the product information? 
The group considered that there is enough evidence to support Q8W dosing taking into account that 
there were not significant differences between Q8W and Q4W regimens in the different studies. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that both regimens seem to have comparable efficacy. 
However, it was also highlighted that there are still some concerns regarding the subgroup of patients 
on Q8W dosing who showed more risk of virological failure (VF). In the multivariate analysis performed 
to explore variables associated with increased risk of confirmed virological failure (CVF), the main 
baseline factors associated with virologic outcome risk factors were: 
- 
- 
having a BMI> 30 kg/m2pre-existing major RPV RAMs that were no identified in the genotype  
subtype A 1/6    
Several measures were proposed to minimise this risk: 
To start a Q4W regimen in those patients who could have higher risk of VF as it was described before. 
In these cases, switching to a Q8W dosing could be considered afterwards in patients who reach and 
maintain undetectability with this regimen.  
The experts also proposed adding a clarification in the SmPC explaining the risk factors which could 
contribute to developing a VF.  In this case, the SmPC labelling would be useful for the clinicians to 
decide on the preferred regimen for every patient. In addition, the current wording of the indication 
already prevents from prescribing this treatment to patients who present or have past evidence of viral 
resistance to NNRTI or INI which may minimise the risk. 
Wording of the indication (section 4.1):  
Vocabria/Rekambys injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine/cabotegravir injection, for the 
treatment  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  type  1  (HIV-1)  infection  in  adults  who  are  virologically 
suppressed  (HIV-1  RNA  <50  copies/mL)  on  a  stable  antiretroviral  regimen  without  present  or  past 
evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class. 
Finally, the experts consider that the patients’ wishes should also be taken into consideration.  
In conclusion, Q8W and Q4W seem to be equally effective. However, special considerations should be 
given to patients who might have higher risk of virological failure on Q8W considering the current data.  
2 .-Could the SAG experts suggest appropriate tools to increase adherence to scheduled 
dosing? 
Adherence is an extremely complex and heterogeneous topic that can change between patients, 
centres, etc, across Member states. Therefore, it is very difficult to make a universal recommendation 
that could apply to all patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 100/140 
 
 
 
 
However, it was also highlighted that new issues can emerge with this new regimen, especially, 
considering the very long half-life of both drugs after injection and therefore, measures should be in 
place to ensure the close monitoring of the patients.  
Some strategies such as peer support, an increased frequency of the visits to the clinic at the 
beginning of treatment, the facilitation of the medication supply to the patients, reminder tools such as 
mobiles, text messages, actions intended to minimise local reactions due to injections, etc., could be of 
help. Overall, the experts remarked that there is no unique tool for all the patients and the strategies 
should be tailored in every case.  
In conclusion, adherence is a key element and should be reinforced, however, there is not a unique 
tool to ensure good adherence to treatment. Hence, measures should be adapted to the centres, 
resources, patients’ characteristics etc. 
3.-Could the SAG experts discuss to what extent they are confident that a post 
approval study could enable substantiating the potential impact of inadequate 
handling of the LA regimen in real life setting (in terms of risk of virological failure and 
emergence of resistance to the dual INI and NNRTI classes)? 
The experts recommend that a non-interventional post approval study on this CAB+RPV LA regimen is 
necessary to complement the data from existing registries. Such a study will substantiate real life 
settings since the clinical trials supporting the dossier were performed in very selected study 
populations. This post marketing study will be pivotal to monitor adherence and collect data on 
virological suppression, using appropriate threshold (i.e. plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <50 c/mL instead of 
<200 c/mL) to avoid waiting for virological failure while on CAB+RPV LA regimen. In addition, patient 
and physician preferences/selection criteria for long acting therapy should be recorded as well as 
comorbidities and co-medications. 
 The experts strongly recommend for such a post approval study to be performed whilst acknowledging 
that challenges in getting reliable data on resistance will occur. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, it can be concluded that the efficacy of  CAB LA, when used in combination with RPV LA, has 
been  established.  The  main  uncertainties  are  the  representativeness  of  the  enrolled  subjects  for  the 
patients to  be  treated  after  licensure,  the development of  resistance  mutations  in  the  few  cases  with 
virologic  failure,  and  the  appropriateness  of  the  regimen  as  currently  proposed,  to  keep  the  virus 
suppressed during the initial months after initiation of CAB + RPV long-acting. 
The switch from a standard oral tritherapy to the bitherapy with CAB LA+RPV LA (as part of a monthly 
regimen  [Q4W]  or  a  2  months  regimen  [Q8W])  in  virologically-suppressed  subjects  is  not  associated 
with significantly higher rates of virologic failure based on the two large non inferiority phase III studies 
(FLAIR and ATLAS studies), the design of which was validated through EMA scientific advice (including 
the non inferiority margin). Furthermore, the ATLAS-2M study could support the use of a Q8W regimen 
which remains non-inferior to the Q4W regimen. 
-  The  LA  formulation  with  its  long  half-life  enabling  an  every  4  weeks  frequency  of  administration  or 
every 8 weeks administration is primarily designed for convenience purpose, to get rid of the constraints 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 101/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of a daily oral administration of a multitherapy and to potentially achieve a better adherence. At this 
stage the indication is confined to adult patients in line with the clinical data in support but given the 
challenging adherence in adolescents a future extension of indication in this population is awaited. The 
lack  of  oral  daily  intake  could  be  an  advantage  for  people  traveling  frequently,  provided  they  could 
manage for the IM route.  
- As for the oral fixed dose combination Juluca (dolutegravir-riplivirine), the combined use of CAB+RPV 
LA is only validated for virologically suppressed patients and is not demonstrated as being adequate to 
achieve  undetectability  in  antiretroviral  naive  patients  (although  off  label  could  be  expected)  or  in 
antiretroviral experienced patients.  
- The oral lead in regimen was a safeguard during clinical trials to ensure tolerance before introducing 
the long-lasting IM formulation.  
Decision to introduce this new LA regimen should take into consideration that compliance to the LA IM 
injections is essential (which may be challenging whether patient did not support them), considering that 
CAB and RPV plasmatic concentrations slowly decrease until approximately one year and may lead to 
subtherapeutic  concentrations  and  consequently  to  RAM  emergence  in  case  of  missed  doses  or  stop 
injections. The risk of selection (and potential transmission) of dual class resistance in case of treatment 
interruption without immediate suppressive regimen given the very long half-life of both products is a 
source of particular concern. Particular statements have been introduced in the SmPC/PL to warn on the 
need for adequate selection of patients and on the risk of resistance in case of delay in introducing a 
fully suppressive treatment after discontinuation. Post approval investigation in the real-life setting is 
critical for further scrutiny on this first LA regimen having in mind the potential individual and collective 
risks it carries.  
Ultimately the applicant has agreed with the CHMP requested conservative wording for the indication. 
Vocabria  injection  is  indicated,  in  combination  with  rilpivirine  injection,  for  the  treatment  of  Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
<50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance 
to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class (see sections 4.2,4.4 and 5.1). 
According to the SAG experts, both Q4W and Q8W regimen could be supported. In the multivariate 
analysis performed to explore variables associated with increased risk of confirmed virological failure, 
the main baseline factors associated with virologic outcome risk factors were BMI> 30 kg/m2; pre-
existing major RPV RAMs that were no identified in the genotype; and subtype A 1/6.  
However, it was also highlighted that there are still some concerns regarding the subgroup of patients 
on Q8W dosing who showed more risk of virological failure (VF). In the multivariate analysis performed 
to explore variables associated with increased risk of confirmed virological failure (CVF), the main 
baseline factors associated with virologic outcome risk factors were: 
• 
• 
• 
having a BMI> 30 kg/m2 
pre-existing major RPV RAMs that were no identified in the genotype  
subtype A 1/6    
Several measures were proposed to minimise this risk: 
• 
To start a Q4W regimen in those patients who could have higher risk of VF as it was described 
before. In these cases, switching to a Q8W dosing could be considered afterwards in patients 
who reach and maintain undetectability with this regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 102/140 
 
 
 
• 
The experts also proposed adding a clarification in the SmPC explaining the risk factors which 
could contribute to developing a VF.  In this case, the SmPC labelling would be useful for the 
clinicians to decide on the preferred regimen for every patient. In addition, the current 
wording of the indication already prevents from prescribing this treatment to patients who 
present or have past evidence of viral resistance to NNRTI or INI which may minimise the risk. 
Finally, two paragraphs in the SmPC section 4.4 were required in order to minimise the risk of 
virological failure: 
- a warning box as regards the risk of resistance following treatment discontinuation: 
Risk of resistance following treatment discontinuation 
To minimise the risk of developing viral resistance it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully 
suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the final injection of Vocabria 
when dosed monthly and no later than two months after the final injection of Vocabria when 
dosed every 2 months. 
- a warning reflecting the increased risk of virologic failure in case of cumulative baseline risk factors: 
Before starting the regimen, it should be taken into account that multivariable analyses indicate 
that a combination of at least 2 of the following baseline factors may be associated with an 
increased risk of virological failure: archived rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, 
or BMI ≥30 kg/m2. In patients with an incomplete or uncertain treatment history without pre-
treatment resistance analyses, caution is warranted in the presence of either BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or 
HIV 1 subtype A6/A1 (see section 5.1)   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Description

The MAH will conduct a prospective cohort study (COMBINE-2 study) to collect 
September 
data from patients in order to assess clinical effectiveness, adherence, durability 
2026 
and discontinuations after initiating the cabotegravir and rilpivirine long acting 
regimen. The study will also monitor for resistance and response to subsequent 
antiretroviral regimens among patients who switched from cabotegravir and 
rilpivirine long acting regimen to another regimen The MAH will submit interim 
study results annually and the final results of the study by September 2026. 
The MAH will conduct a real-world five-year Drug Utilisation Study (DUS). This 
September 
observational cohort study will aim to better understand the patient population

Patient exposure 
In the Phase 3 studies: 
Table 39
The majority of subjects in Study 201585 transitioned to Study 207966 (ATLAS-2M) after completing 
Maintenance Phase at Week 52, therefore the extent of exposure represented in these data is higher in 
Study 201584. 
In the Phase 2 studies, the median time of exposure to CAB + RPV in Study 200056 (LATTE 2) for the 
oral CAB arm was 700 days (~100 weeks). The median number of CAB LA + RPV LA injections was 25 
and 46 for the Q8W and Q4W treatment arms, respectively. In Study LAI116482 (LATTE), median time 
of exposure to oral CAB was 1177 days (168 weeks) and median exposure to oral RPV was 505 days (72 
weeks).

Overall, 1865 HIV-1 infected patients were treated with CAB LA + RPV LA, including 1228 with the Q4W 
regimen. Almost all subjects (n=542; 92%) treated with CAB + RPV IM in the 2 Phase 3 pivotal studies 
were exposed for at least 1 year. 
Adverse events 
Table 40
During the Maintenance Phase, injection site reaction (ISRs) were the most common AEs reported in 
the CAB + RPV group. Non-ISR AEs were reported in 86% of subjects in the pooled CAB + RPV group 
and in 75% of subjects in the pooled CAR group:

Common AEs 
In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), the most commonly reported non-ISRs AEs 
occurring in ≥5% of subjects in either treatment group were generally similar, although higher rates of 
AEs were reported in the CAB + RPV group for haemorrhoids, pyrexia, dizziness, fatigue, headache, 
nausea, diarrhea, and back pain.

AEs by Grade 
The majority of events reported in the Phase III programme had an intensity of Grade 1 or Grade 2 for 
both treatment groups. No Grade 5 events were reported in the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 
201585) for subjects receiving CAB + RPV; 1 Grade 5 (fatal) AE of methamphetamine overdose 
occurred in the CAR group (Study 201585), which was reported as unrelated to study treatment. 
Overall, a higher proportion of subjects who switched to CAB + RPV had Grade 3 to 4 AEs compared 
with subjects who continued CAR (11% compared with 6%). Fifty (8%) subjects had Grade 3 events in 
the CAB + RPV group and 29 (5%) subjects had Grade 3 events in the CAR group. Sixteen (3%) 
subjects had Grade 4 events in the CAB + RPV group and 5 (<1%) subjects had Grade 4 events in the 
CAR group. This difference between treatment groups may be partially attributable to the higher 
incidence of acute viral hepatitis, ISRs, and AEs of lipase abnormalities and CPK and AST elevations in 
the CAB + RPV group. 
The most common Grade 2 to 4 non-ISR AEs reported during the Maintenance Phase were headache 
(3% CAB + RPV vs. 2% CAR), diarrhoea (3% CAB + RPV vs. 1% CAR), nasopharyngitis (3% CAB + 
RPV vs. 1% CAR), and back pain (3% CAB + RPV vs. <1% CAR). 
Drug-related AEs 
In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), the most frequently reported, Grade 2 to 4, 
drug-related, non-ISR AEs in the CAB + RPV group were headache (5 subjects [<1%]), diarrhoea (5 
subjects [<1%]), fatigue (4 subjects [<1%]) and pyrexia (4 subjects [<1%]).

Table 43
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Seven deaths were reported during the pooled Phase III studies (Study 201584 and Study 201585) and 
Phase II studies. All were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to study drug with the exception 
of a case of sudden death attributed to myocardial infarction by the investigator despite no post-mortem 
report or data suggesting MI (in Study 200056) where the investigator could not rule out the possibility 
of relationship to study drug. In addition, 1 death (acute pancreatitis) was reported during the Phase III 
study  207966  (ATLAS-2M)  through  the  Week  24  data  cut-off.  Pancreatitis  was  considered  by  the 
investigator as possibly related to the study drugs so the death might have been related to study drugs. 
A second death (cerebral haemorrhage) was reported in study 207966 considered as not-drug related 
since it occurred before the patient received the study product. After the data-lock point for the initial 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020

submission,  2  other  deaths  have  been  reported  in  study  LAI116482  (cardiac  arrest  during  surgery, 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage) but are poorly documented. 
During the Maintenance Phase in the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), 31 subjects in the 
CAB + RPV group had a total of 37 SAEs and 26 subjects in the CAR group had a total of 33 SAEs. The 
incidence of subjects developing at least 1 SAE was low and similar between treatment groups in the 
Maintenance  Phase  (CAB  +  RPV  5%;  CAR  4%).  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  Hepatitis  A 
(reported in 4 subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 2 subjects in the CAR group), colitis (reported in 1 
subject in the CAB + RPV group and 2 subjects in the CAR group), anal abscess (reported in 0 subjects 
in the CAB + RPV group and 2 subjects in the CAR group), and anogenital warts (reported in 1 subject 
in the CAB + RPV group and 2 subjects in the CAR group). Two of these SAEs were considered study 
drug-related (right knee monoarthritis and suicidal ideation).  
In  the  study  207966,  30  SAEs  were  reported  through  Week  24  (Q8W,  15/522  [3%];  Q4W;  15/523 
[3%]).  Three  drug-related  SAEs  were  considered  drug-related:  site  abscess  (Q8W  group),  allergic 
reaction  (hypersensitivity preferred term)  (Q4W  group),  and  acute  pancreatitis  (Q8W  group,  cf  death 
subjects). For both the injection site abscess and allergic reaction SAEs, study drug was withdrawn, and 
the subjects recovered. The injection site abscess was considered possibly related to RPV because the 
gluteal abscess appeared on the same site where RPV was administered by IM injection. 
In response to D120 LOQ, 6 new SAEs have been reported in FLAIR (n=2), LATTE-2 (n=2) and ATLAS-
2M (n=2) considered as not drug-related except 2 SAE related to partial IV administration of RPV LA. 
For the case of delusion reported, the causal relationship of study drugs cannot be ruled out considering 
that psychiatric side effects are common with NNRTIs and INSTIs. 
Adverse events of interest 
ISRs 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 109/140 
 
 
 
Table 44
Overall,  both  CAB  and  RPV  injections  seems  well  tolerated  throughout  the  studies,  even  though  pain 
associated to IM injections was very commonly reported. Less than 5% of subjects experienced Grade 3 
or more ISR AEs, and the proportion of subjects who withdraw from study due to ISRs is very low (<1%). 
Of note, although pain was the main ISR AE reported, a non-negligible rate of nodules and induration (
≈15%) was observed. The few cases reported as “recovered with sequelae” relate mostly to “injection 
site pain” with a large interval for the duration. No significant differences in ISRs between CAB and RPV 
were observed. No trends were observed for an association between needle length and incidence, type, 
or severity of ISRs for either CAB or RPV. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), 14 subjects met liver stopping criteria (LSC) (11 
in the CAB+RPV group, 3 in the CAR group). All of the subjects who met LSC had acute viral hepatitis. 
There were no cases of DILI. Five subjects each had 1 AE potentially associated with hepatotoxicity in 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 110/140 
 
 
 
 
 
the Maintenance Phase of the Phase III studies (CAB + RPV, 4 [<1%], CAR, 1 [<1%]). These events 
included hepatic cirrhosis (Grade 3; CAR group), hepatic steatosis (Grade 2; CAB + RPV group), hepatic 
toxic (Grade 1; CAB + RPV group), hepatocellular injury (Grade 4; CAB + RPV group), and non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (Grade 1; CAB + RPV group). None of the AEs were considered to be related to study 
treatment or to represent DILI. 
In the Phase III study 207966, there was 1 report of DILI possibly related to CAB + RPV according to 
the Hepatic Adjudication Committee. Four other subjects (2 subjects in each arm) have met LSC. Three 
of them had acute viral hepatitis (B, C and E), and the remaining had a DILI possibly due to another 
prohibited treatment (Melanotan II). 
In the Phase II studies, 4 subjects receiving oral CAB met LSC for which no alternative aetiology has 
been identified. One additional subject from a clinical pharmacology study also met LSC  for which no 
alternative  aetiology  has  been  identified.  These  five  subjects  receiving  oral  CAB  were  adjudicated  by 
hepatic  experts  to  have  suspected  drug  induced  liver  injury  (DILI)  or  hepatotoxicity.  Three  of  these 
subjects were on oral CAB 30 mg once daily and the remaining two were on oral CAB 60 mg. Severe 
hepatotoxicity with significant liver dysfunction or liver failure has not been observed. The degree of ALT 
elevation in these subjects was either Grade 3 or Grade 4. Aminotransferase elevations in these subjects 
have been transient and reversible. 
Hepatotoxicity and risk of DILI will be kept under close scrutiny through a dedicated PASS study as 
agreed by the applicant. 
Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) 
In  the  Phase  II  and  the  2  pivotal  Phase  III  studies,  no  cases  of  HSR  have  been  observed  following 
exposure  to  CAB  during  the  CAB  +  RPV  development  programme.  No  subjects  were  excluded  from 
treatment with CAB LA and RPV LA because of suspected HSR during the OLI. 
In  the  Phase III  study  207966,  a  Grade  3,  drug-related,  allergic  reaction  was  reported  as  a  SAE  and 
resulted in withdrawal of the subject from the study. This case is not considered by the Sponsor to be a 
delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. 
In response to D120 LOQ, no cases suggestive of HSR have been reported except one grade 3 allergic 
reaction  after  injection  of  both  CAB+RPV  attributed  by  the  applicant  to  partial  IV  drugs  study 
administration. Considering that both NNRTIs and INSTIs are known to induce HSR, and the favourable 
outcome with antiallergic drug, hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out in this case and should be closely 
monitored in PSUR. 
Rash 
In  the  pooled  Phase  III  studies,  no  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  rashes  observed.  Rash  AESIs  (i.e.,  identified 
using key words “rash”, “eruption”, “photosensitivity”, or “urticaria”) were reported in 23 subjects in the 
CAB + RPV group and 14 subjects in the CAR group. No rash AESIs were considered serious, 10 rash 
AESI reports were considered to be drug-related (9 CAB + RPV, 1 CAR), and none led to withdrawal of 
study drug. Most resolved without drug discontinuation before the following injection. 
QT prolongation 
The QTc study with oral CAB did not highlight an effect of CAB on QT prolongation.  
In response to the D120 LOQ, it has been observed a few occurrences of QTcF>500 ms and increases 
>60 ms from baseline in the phase 2 and phase 3 studies without evidence of a correlation with RPV or 
CAB plasma concentrations. All the events resolved despite CAB+RPV continuation. It should be kept in 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 111/140 
 
 
 
 
mind that high exposure to RPV is associated to QT prolongation. For CAB, there are no evidence of an 
increased risk of QT interval prolongation. 
Psychiatric AEs 
In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation had a 
higher incidence in subjects with histories of these disorders: 
Table 45
There was no significant difference on suicidal ideation and depression between treatment groups.  
4 (<1%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 5 (<1%) subjects in the CAR group had AEs of suicidal 
ideation  or  behaviour.  1  subject  in  the  CAB  +  RPV  group  had  an  AE  of  suicidal  depression  that  was 
considered to be related to study drug and was subsequently discontinued from the study. Two AEs in 
the CAR group were Grade 3; these 2 subjects had no prior history of suicidal ideation. One of the Grade 
3  AEs  of  suicidal  ideation  was  considered  serious  (SAE)  and  related  to  study  drug.  This  subject  also 
experienced Grade 3 AEs of anxiety and depression. 2 subjects in the CAR group had SAEs of suicidal 
ideation (n=1) and suicide attempt (n=1). 3 subjects withdrew from study drug due to AEs of suicidal 
ideation (n=1, CAR group), suicide attempt (n=1, CAR group), and depression suicidal (n=1, CAB + RPV 
group). 
16 (3%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 14 (2%) subjects in the CAR group reported depression. 
5 subjects in the CAB + RPV group had depression AEs that were considered study drug related. Most of 
the AEs of depression were Grade 1 or 2. One subject in the CAR group with no prior history of depression 
had a Grade 3 AE of depression that was considered to be related to study drug and led to discontinuation 
from the study. 
27 (5%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 20 (3%) subjects in the CAR group had AEs related to 
anxiety. Most AEs reported were Grade 1 or 2. AEs of anxiety were considered to be related to study 
drug in 10 other subjects (8 CAB + RPV; 2 CAR). There were no SAEs of anxiety. 1 subject in the CAB 
+  RPV  group  and  1  subject  in  the  CAR  group  withdrew  from  study  due  to  AEs  of  anxiety  or  anxiety 
disorder. 
Across the Phase 2 and 3 studies, no serious psychiatric events such as bipolarity and psychosis were 
considered related with CAB. 
Sleep disorders were observed throughout the clinical development of CAB, with a higher incidence of 
insomnia. Across the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), 38 (6%) subjects in the CAB + RPV 
group and 21 (4%) subject in the CAR group had AEs of sleep disorders. Most of these AEs were insomnia, 
which was reported in 22 (4%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 8 (1%) subjects in the CAR group. 
All of the sleep disorder AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity. In 15 subjects in the CAB + RPV group 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 112/140 
 
 
 
 
 
and 4 subjects in the CAR group, AEs of sleep disorder were considered to be related to study drug. No 
SAEs and no withdrawals due to AEs of sleep disorders were reported. 
Seizures 
Across the Phase III pivotal studies, 6 (1%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 2 (<1%) subjects in 
the CAR group had AEs potentially associated with seizures. None of these events were considered to be 
associated with seizure, were not serious, and did not lead to withdrawal. Most were Grade 1 or 2 (1 
Grade 3 event of seizure occurred in the CAR group in Study 201585) and all were considered not related 
to  study  treatment  with  CAB  +  RPV  with  1  exception  of  an  event  of  syncope  with  a  verbatim  term 
“vasovagal syncope-not cardiac”. 
Weight gain 
Overall, a trend towards slight weight gain was observed in the Phase II and III trials for subjects in 
the CAB + RPV group vs CAR group (median change 1.5 kg vs. 1.0 kg for the CAR group at Week 48 in 
the Phase 3 studies) 
Rhabdomyolysis 
No rhabdomyolysis case related to CAB+RPV was reported. In the Phase III pivotal studies, Grade 3 and 
4  elevations  of  CK  were  observed  in  47  (8%)  subjects  in  the  CAB  +  RPV  group  through 48  weeks  of 
treatment,  compared  with  26  (4%)  subjects  in  the  CAR  group.  These  CK  elevations  were  transient, 
asymptomatic and generally associated with subjects reporting strenuous exercise and/or weightlifting.  
More subjects in the CAB + RPV group had AEs of myalgia compared with those in the CAR group (24 
[4%] subjects vs. 8 [1%] subjects, respectively). 1 AE of myalgia (CAB + RPV group) led to study drug 
discontinuation. 1 subject in the CAB + RPV group had a Grade 2 AE of myositis associated with Grade 
4 CK elevation and the myositis was considered related to treatment. 
Pancreatitis 
Across the Phase III pivotal studies, 3 (<1%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group (n=4 events) and no 
subjects  in  the  CAR  group  had  AEs  potentially  associated  with  pancreatitis.  None  of  these  AEs  led  to 
study drug discontinuation. Most of the clinical laboratory assessments for lipase elevations were Grade 
1 or Grade 2. 
In the Phase III study 207966, there was a single report of acute pancreatitis in a subject in the Q8W 
group (see section “Deaths”). The investigator considers the pancreatitis possibly related to study drugs 
as  they  are  unable  to  exclude  a  causative  association.  Despite  the  long  latency  period  and  possible 
confounders,  as  pancreatitis  have  been  observed  with  other  INSTI  or  NNRTIs,  the  relationship  to  the 
study drugs cannot be ruled out. 
No cases of pancreatitis were reported in the Phase II studies. 
As a conservative approach the fatal case of pancreatitis will be reported in the section 4.8 stating that 
the causality cannot be ruled out. 
Renal disorders 
Overall,  cystatin-c  levels  did  not  suggest  worsening  of  eGFR,  glomerular  disease,  or  proximal  tubule 
dysfunction. In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), 2 (<1%) subjects in the CAB + RPV 
group and 3 (<1%) subjects in the CAR group had AEs related to creatinine abnormalities. The 2 cases 
in the CAB + RPV group were non-serious, not considered drug-related and not leading to withdrawal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 113/140 
 
 
 
 
In the Phase III study 207966, an AE of creatinine renal clearance decreased occurred in 1 (<1%) subject 
in the Q8W group and 4 (<1%) subjects in the Q4W group. All of the events of creatinine renal clearance 
decreased were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Two AEs of creatinine renal clearance decreased in the Q4W 
group  were  considered  drug  related.  None  of  the  AEs  of  creatinine  renal  clearance  decreased  led  to 
discontinuation from the study. 
In the Phase II studies, there were two serious reports potentially associated with impact on creatinine 
during treatment with CAB + RPV (Grade 4 acute kidney injury and Grade 4 renal failure). Both were 
not considered related to study drug (cardiogenic/septic shock and suicide attempt, respectively). 
Laboratory findings 
In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), the majority (389/521 [74.7%] in the CAB + RPV 
group  and  413/515  [80.2%]  in  the  CAR  group)  of  the  post-baseline  emergent  clinical  chemistry 
abnormalities  were  Grade  1  or  Grade  2  in  intensity.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  observed 
overall in subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 or Grade 4 post-baseline emergent abnormalities between the 
CAB + RPV and CAR groups.

There was a numerical difference (higher incidence) for the CAB + RPV group versus the comparator 
group with respect to the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 elevations for the following parameters; Alanine 
aminotransferase; Aspartate aminotransferase; Creatine kinase and Lipase. 
Haematology 
Overall, the changes from Baseline in haematology values for the pooled Phase III studies (201584 
and 201585) were not clinically relevant. 
Safety in special populations 
In the 201584 and 201585 pooled analysis, the AE profile for CAB + RPV was comparable across age, 
sex, and race. 
The HCV co-infected subjects in the CAB + RPV arm did not develop signs or symptoms of DILI during 
their study participation. Although the number of subjects is limited, the hepatic safety profile of CAB in 
asymptomatic HCV co-infected subjects seems not worsened. 
No safety data are available in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.  In response to D120 LOQ, the 
applicant  provided  a  comparison  of  safety  profile  with  CAB+RPV  between  patients  with  (50  and  <90 
mL/min/1.73m2) and without (≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment at baseline did not identified any 
trends or clustering of AEs in patients with mild renal impairment at baseline. No data have been provided 
in patients with mild hepatic impairment, based on PK data available, no dose adjustment is expected.

Discontinuation due to AES 
In the pooled Phase III studies (201584 and 201585), 22 (4%) subjects in the CAB + RPV group and 9 
(2%) subjects in the CAR group experienced non-ISR AEs leading to withdrawal/permanent 
discontinuation of study drug during the Maintenance Phase: 
Table 54
Additionally, 1 subject in the CAB + RPV group (Study 201585) was discontinued due to meeting the 
protocol-defined liver stopping criteria, which was not considered as an AE leading to withdrawal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 119/140 
 
 
 
 
 
6 subjects withdrew during the Maintenance Phase due to 10 ISRs including injection site pain (n=8; 6 
AEs were Grade 2, 2 AEs were Grade 3), injection site nodule (n=1, Grade 2), and injection site swelling 
(n=1, Grade 2). All of the ISR AEs were considered to be related to study drug. Two additional subjects 
withdrew from Study 201584 citing intolerability of injections but did not name a specific ISR AE term 
that led to withdrawal. 
During the OLI period of the Maintenance Phase, 6 subjects (3 in each study) withdrew due to AEs. The 
AEs  that  occurred  in  Study  201584  were  acute  hepatitis  C  (Grade  2),  hepatitis  A  (Grade  4),  and 
transaminases increased (Grade 3), probably related to chronic hepatitis C infection, illicit drug use and 
inorganic solvent abuse. None of these AEs were considered to be related to study drug. AEs leading to 
withdrawal  in  Study  201585  were  asthenia  (Grade  1),  myalgia  (Grade1),  headache  (Grade  3),  and 
depression suicidal (Grade 2). All 4 AEs were considered to be related to study drug. 
In study 207966 (ATLAS-2M), the rate of AEs leading to withdrawal was similar between the Q8W arm 
(8/522 [2%]) and the Q4W arm (10/523 [2%]) through Week 24. The most frequently reported, non-
ISR AE leading to withdrawal was fatigue (Q8W, 1/522 [<1%]; Q4W, 2/523 [<1%]). No AEs leading to 
withdrawal occurred at a frequency of ≥1% in either treatment group. Three (<1%) subjects on Q8W 
and 4 (<1%) subjects on Q4W reported ISRs that led to withdrawal.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of CAB+RPV is based on the pooled phase III studies, studies 201584 and 201585. A 
comprehensive review of safety data gathered in phase II studies is lacking. To put in perspective, it is 
noted that longer follow up are expected from the ongoing phase III studies FLAIR and ATLAS. 
The safety analysis for CAB + RPV LA was based on the Week 48 data of the pooled phase III studies, 
FLAIR and ATLAS. Relevant safety findings of Phase II-b and Phase III-b studies are included, as well as 
relevant  Week  96  data  of  the  pooled  phase  III  studies  that  became  available  after  the  start  of  the 
application procedure. 
In pooled phase III studies, a higher frequency of AEs has been reported in the CAB+RPV treatment arm 
compared to CAR treatment arm. Considering the design of these both studies, a higher rate of AEs is 
not unexpected in these open-label studies and in subjects switching to this new regimen in comparison 
to subjects continuing their current oral ARV treatment, which is supposed to be well tolerated. 
Apart from the ISRs, the more frequent AEs reported and drug-related with CAB+RPV, in comparison to 
the CAR regimen, are gastrointestinal disorders (nausea and diarrhoea), nervous system disorders and 
psychiatric disorders (headache, fatigue and asthenia, dizziness, abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia 
and  malaise).  Other  more  frequent  AEs  (myalgia  and  pyrexia)  might  be  associated  with  the  injection 
formulation of CAB+RPV.  
Regarding AE leading to withdrawal, in pooled phase III studies, most AEs leading to withdrawal are viral 
hepatitis as planned in the study protocols. For the other AEs leading to withdrawal, no specific pattern 
was identified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 120/140 
 
 
 
The salient aspects of the safety profile of CAB+RPV are: 
-Injection Site reactions:  
ISRs AES were expected with CAB and RPV administered by intramuscular injection. Most ISRs are grade 
1 or 2 with less than 1% of ISRs in phase III studies classified as grade 3 (or 4) and less than 1% of 
ISRs leading to ME withdrawal. Most ISRs reported are pain but there have been also nodule, induration, 
swelling,  erythema  and  pruritus  reported  at  a  significant  frequency.  Most  ISRs  in  phase  III  studies 
resolved within 14 days with a median duration of 3 days but 17% of subjects experienced ISRs lasting 
more than 14 days. Otherwise, duration of ISRs have been analysed globally for all ISRs. A more detailed 
analysis of the duration and outcome for pain and other ISRs has been provided by the applicant together 
with a review of the sequelae reported after ISRs reported in 4% of subjects.  
Similar results regarding the severity, type and outcome of local ISRs have been found in phase II study 
200056. 
Unfortunately, the ISRs (type, frequency, outcome) have not been analysed according to the location of 
the injection  because this  information  was  not  recorded.  The  comparison  of  ISRs  in  groups  QW4  and 
QW8  in  study  found  similar  results  with  regards  to  severity  and  duration  of  local  ISRs  but  a  higher 
frequency of nodule and injection site discomfort in group QW4.   
In phase III studies, 1.5 inch 23 gauge needles have been recommended to investigators to administer 
CAB  and  RPV  LA.  The  proposed  SmPC  for  Vocabria recommend now  the use of  1  ½  inches 23  gauge 
needle since the local safety of  CAB and  RPV injections likely based on the clinical experience gained 
during phase II/III studies. However, a statement has been added for HCP in the SmPC who should take 
into account the BMI of the patient to ensure that the needle length is sufficient to reach the gluteus 
muscle.  
-Hepatotoxicity:  
Overall  elevated  liver  enzymes  meeting  liver  stopping  criteria  were  numerically  more  frequent  with 
cabotegravir  than  with  CAR  (dolutegravir)  in  the  phase  III  studies.  Alternative  diagnosis  mainly  viral 
hepatitis  explains  the  majority  of  these  AEs.  No  cases  of  DILI  among  patients  experiencing  liver 
abnormalities and liver stopping criteria have been identified by the independent hepatic adjudication 
committee in these 2 studies. However, some cases of steatohepatitis have been reported of grade 1 or 
2. All have been considered as not-drug-related.  
A total of 6 cases of DILI have been reported with CAB+RPV in phase I/II studies and ATLAS-2M study. 
All the cases of DILI have been reported with oral CAB with or without RPV, at two different dosages for 
CB 30 mg (n=4) and 60 mg (n=2). None of these cases included any symptoms notably signs suggesting 
hypersensitivity (HS). All these cases have been detected following close liver monitoring, every 4 weeks.  
No new cases of liver disorder have been identified in the Safety Update report.  
The review of hepatotoxicity reported with CAB+RPV in clinical programme until now did not identify any 
raise  additional  safety  concerns.  The  review  of  the  causes  of  liver  chemistry  changes  identified  pre-
existing hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, imbalance of acute viral hepatitis in the arm 
CAB+RPV  without  clear  explanation.  At  this  stage,  a  warning  for  hepatotoxicity  is  recommended  as 
proposed  by  the  applicant  since  these  safety  data  for  CAB+RPV  might  be  falsely  reassuring  and 
“hepatoxicity” should be considered as a identified risk. 
-Hypersensitivity: No AEs suggestive of HSR have been identified in the clinical programme for CAB+ 
RPV  administered  orally  or  by  IM  injection  for  HIV  infection.  And  the  case  of  HSR  reported  in  study 
ATLAS-2M is reasonably not a type I hypersensitivity reaction. However, hypersensitivity is a class-effect 
Assessment report

of  integrase  inhibitors  (and  NNRTIs)  and  listed  in  the  SmPC  for  all  these  products.  A  warning  in  the 
Vocabria PI as proposed by the applicant is necessary. 
-Psychiatric disorders: No SAE related to suicidal behavior nor any completed suicide has been reported 
with CAB+RPV in the phase III studies, suicidal ideation has been reported with a frequency “uncommon” 
and  similar  than  in  group  CAR  (Triumeq).  Moreover,  suicidal  behavior  notably  in  patients  with  pre-
existing  history  of  mental  illness  together  with  depression  are  listed  in  the  SmPC  for  all  Integrase 
inhibitors since it is considered as a class-effect. Suicidal ideation should be listed in the PI for CAB+RPV. 
Depression  and  anxiety  were  reported  at  a  frequency  “common”  and  similarly  in  groups  CAR  and 
CAB+RPV with very few cases serious or severe.  Sleep disorders were reported throughout the clinical 
development of CAB+RPV, with a higher incidence compared to the patients receiving other cART. The 
most frequent sleep disorders reported were insomnia reported at a frequency “common”. Most AEs did 
not lead to study drug discontinuation. This is consistent with the known safety profile of the other INI, 
Ten treatment-emergent deaths were reported in the Phase 2 and 3 studies, including 8 deaths in the 
CAB+RPV  treatment  group.  These  deaths  were  considered  unrelated  to  CAB+RPV  except  in  one  case 
(myocardial  infarction)  where  the  causal  relationship  cannot  be  excluded.  However,  for  2  of  them 
(“cardiac arrest during surgery” and “death with unknown cause”) the causal relationship to CAB+RPV 
cannot be excluded at this stage. More information is needed if possible. The exact cause of these deaths 
is unknown. 
For the other AEs of interest: 
Rash, mainly grade 1 or 2, has been commonly reported with CAB+RPV with no study drug withdrawal 
for rash reported. 
A total of 6 seizures have been reported with CAB+RPV in the clinical programme submitted. None were 
drug related. 
No cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported with CAB+RPV. Myalgia and increase in CPK have been 
reported commonly.  
One case of severe acute pancreatitis, possibly drug-related, has been reported with CAB+RPV. In the 
ATLAS-2M study, one subject died of pancreatitis that could be drug-related. As a conservative approach 
the fatal case of pancreatitis will be reported in section 4.8 stating that the causality cannot be ruled 
out. 
The  laboratory  abnormalities  identified  at  day  80  are  common,  mild  and  asymptomatic  bilirubin 
elevations without transaminase elevation which reflect the competition between CAB and unconjugated 
bilirubin  because  of  the  common  clearance  pathway  through  UGT1A1,  ALT/AST  elevations  mostly 
attributed  to  viral  hepatitis  with  an  imbalance  in  the  CAB+RPV  treatment  group,  CK  elevations  of  all 
grades attributed to exercise but more frequent in CAB+RPV treatment group, and lipase elevations with 
more grade 3/ 4 with CAB. 
Pregnancy:  a  total  of  16  pregnancy  cases  have  been  reported  in  the  CAB+RPV  clinical  programme 
including 3 cases with exposure to CAR, 2 cases with exposure to CAB+RPV via semen, and 11 cases 
with in utero exposure to CAB+RPV. The review of the outcome of these pregnancies did not identify any 
safety concern. Overall data on use during pregnancy are too limited to conclude on the risk associated 
with in utero exposure to CAB+RPV. 
Medication errors (ME): a total of 18 medication errors have been reported in the pooled phase III studies 
conducted with CAB+RPV including 14 ME related to wrong dosage and 3 ME presumed to be related to 
partial IV administration of the study product leading to AE (1 allergy-like reaction, 1 lack of efficacy, 1 
vaso-vagal reaction). In response to D120 LOQ additional cases of accidental partial IV administration 
of CAB and/or RPV have been identified after an immediate reaction post-injection or in subjects with 
Assessment report

Page 122/140 
 
 
 
elevated  RPV  or  CAB  concentrations  shortly  after  receiving  RPV  or  CAB  LA  leading  to  milder  AEs.  A 
statement in section 4.2 on the need of care to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel has been 
added.  Nevertheless,  the  MEs  represent  a  significant  potential  risk  for  CAB+RPV  considering  the  co-
existent of different formulation (oral, IM) and dosage (400 and 600 mg). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the safety data from pooled phase I and III studies, partially phase II studies, cabotegravir 
administrated  with  RPV  seems  to  have  an  acceptable  level  of  safety  for  the  indication  proposed.  The 
salient aspects of the safety profile of CAB+RPV are the injection site reactions. In common with the INI 
class,  the  other  risks  identified  are  hepatotoxicity,  hypersensitivity  and  psychiatric  disorders  notably 
depression, anxiety, sleep disorders commonly reported. Already at this stage of development suicidal 
behaviour was reported which is to be underlined when having in mind that CAB is structurally close to 
DTG  known  to  induce  suicidal  attempt/  ideation  particularly  in  patient  with  history  of  psychiatric 
disorders. The use of CAB+RPV during pregnancy is a missing information. The risk of medication error, 
notably the use of the wrong dosage and inadvertent IV administration, is a potential risk identified.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18-3-2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of cabotegravir with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cabotegravir to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.   Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vocabria (cabotegravir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as:  
• 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), 
Art 10a(1)(a), DIR Art 21a(b), Art 22a(1)(a)]; 
It has an obligation to conduct post-authorisation efficacy studies [REG Art 9(4)(cc), 
Art 10a(1)(b), DIR Art 21a(f), Art 22a(1)(b)];

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
While untreated HIV-1 infection remains a life-threatening disease, for years it has become a chronic 
disease  with  combined  antiretroviral  therapy  being  early  introduced  to  prevent  pejorative  impact  of 
immune deficiency (notably including opportunistic infections in patients with CD4<200/mm3). 
The  goal  of  ARV  therapy  for  HIV-1  infection  is  to  delay  disease  progression  and  prolong  survival  by 
achieving  maximal  and  durable  suppression  of  HIV-1  replication.  Thanks  to  combined  antiretroviral 
therapies [mostly consisting in tritherapy with one main agent [boosted protease inhibitor (PI), integrase 
inhibitor  (INI)  or  non  nucleoside  transcriptase  inhibitor  (INNTI)]  and  a  backbone  regimen  [with  two 
nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (NRTI)]  nowadays  available  high  level  of  viral  suppression 
(>90% of patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) can be achieved in HIV infected patients.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Simplified  regimen  has  become  an  issue  for  particular  investigation  in  such  a  chronic  disease.  This 
notably pertains to the so called virologically suppressed patients (HIV RNA <50 copies/ml), i.e. once 
the  undetectability  has  been  adequately  (durably)  obtained  in  patients  with  a  standard  multitherapy, 
several simplified approaches to reduce the treatment burden are being tested so as to sustain at long 
term  this  undetectability.  While  monotherapy  and  less  frequent  administration  of  the  multitherapy  (4 
days a week, as currently tested in the ANRS Quatuor clinical trial/ 4D regimen) remains to be validated, 
the oral once daily single-tablet 2-drug regimen with dolutegravir (INI) and rilpivirine (NNRTI) as fixed 
dose combination, Juluca was approved in 2018 (EU and US) as the first simplified maintenance regimen 
in virologically suppressed patients.  
It is also noteworthy that even in non virologically suppressed patients, i.e., patients in first line regimen, 
treatment naïve patients, a simplified regimen consisting of a bitherapy (and not a tritherapy) has been 
first  recently  (July  2019)  approved;  Dovato  a  fixed  dose  combination  with  dolutegravir  (INI)  and 
lamivudine (NRTI). 
In  virologically  suppressed  patients,  ViiV  healthcare  is  now  proposing  a  new  approach  for  the 
maintenance  simplified  regimen  in  virologically  suppressed  patients,  with  Vocabria  (cabotegravir) 
consisting in a parenteral administration (IM, long acting) every 4 or 8 weeks. Cabotegravir is a new 
representative  of  the  known  pharmacological  class  of  INI,  with  a  chemical  structure  very  close  to 
dolutegravir. In line with its clinical development, Vocabria IM is to be used in combination with rilpivirine 
IM  long  acting  every  4  or  8  weeks  as  well.  A  parallel  centralised  procedure  is  in  review  process  with 
harmonised timelines. 
Vocabria is not aimed at answering an unmet medical need but rather proposed for convenience to get 
rid of the constraint of a daily oral administration of a combined antiretroviral regimen. 
For  Vocabria  IM  route,  the  applicant  has  ultimately  endorsed  in  response  to  the  CHMP  request  the 
following therapeutic indication:  
Vocabria  injection  is  indicated,  in  combination  with  rilpivirine  injection,  for  the  treatment  of  Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 128/140 
 
 
 
<50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance 
to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
In addition to this IM route, Vocabria has been developed as an oral route to be used under restricted 
conditions:  
-  Before introducing the long acting IM route, to test the tolerance  
- 
In case of missing IM doses or pre-planned interruption 
It has therefore not been developed to be part of a long term combined antiretroviral regimen in first 
line therapy. 
It has to be underlined that the indications are currently confined to adult patients, i.e. while adherence 
is  particularly  challenging  in  adolescent  patients,  this  population  is  not  yet  targeted  in  the  claimed 
indication. 
Finally, it is worth mentioning that Vocabria is also currently being developed for the HIV prevention 
(PrEP), out of the scope of the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  dose-response  relationship  for  antiviral  activity  of  cabotegravir  was  assessed  in  HIV-1  infected 
subjects in the Phase I/IIa proof-of-concept 10 days monotherapy studies ITZ111451 and ITZ112929. 
The  dose  regimen  of  cabotegravir  was  assessed  throughout  two  Phase  IIb  studies  in  HIV-1  infected 
subjects (LAI116482 [LATTE study] and 200056 [LATTE-2 study]). 
The clinical efficacy of the dual maintenance regimen with cabotegravir LA  in combination with rilpivirine 
LA both administered every 4 weeks is based on the 48 weeks data from two large open label randomised 
controlled pivotal  Phase  III  switch  studies in  HIV-1  infected  subjects  (201584 [FLAIR  study,  N=566 ] 
and  201585  [ATLAS  study,  N=616  ]).  In  addition,  Week  48  data  from  an  additional  Phase  III  study 
(207966 [ATLAS-2M study]), comparing the 4W regimen versus an alternative 8W dose regimen, are 
available. 
These studies were broadly similar in terms of design and objective (both studies assessing the rate of 
virological failure after 48 weeks of switch). Both studies were designed as non-inferiority studies versus 
a continuation arm with the current oral antiretroviral regimen (CAR: ABC/DTG/3TC in the FLAIR study 
and 2 NRTIs + 1 PI, NNRTI or INI in the ATLAS study). Of note, prior to randomisation, subjects were 
stably suppressed for at least 6 months in ATLAS study, while it was for a median of 16.10 weeks in 
FLAIR study. 
A  total  of  1182  patients  were  included  and  treated  within  these  Phase  3  studies  (591  patients  with 
CAB+RPV  and  591  in  the  control  arms  consisting  of  patients  with  their  current  oral  ARV  regimen), 
conferring an adequate power for the interpretation of efficacy data. 
The design of each open label randomised pivotal FLAIR and ATLAS studies, the pooling of these two 
study results, the non-inferiority margin of the individual studies (6%) and of the pooled studies (4% 
pooling enabling a more reliable efficacy estimate) were agreed by the EMA scientific advices.  
As a particularity of this clinical development, an oral formulation of CAB and RPV therapy (one Vocabria 
tablet [30 mg] and one rilpivirine tablet [25 mg] once daily during one month) was to be used to ensure 
the tolerance of this bitherapy before to start the long acting formulations [as part of the Oral lead in 
phase (OLI)].   
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 129/140 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, this oral CAB and RPV was recommended as a bridging therapy: if a patient plans to miss a 
scheduled  injection  visit  by  more  than  7  days,  oral  formulations  may  be  used  to  replace  up  to  2 
consecutive monthly injection visits. The first dose of oral therapy should be taken approximately one 
month  after  the  last  injection  dose  of  Vocabria  or  rilpivirine.  This  proposal  was  supported  by  POPPK 
analysis (with a target value of Cmin at 0.65 µg/ml). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The performance of cabotegravir IM to sustain the virologic suppression in combination with rilpivirine 
IM, could be substantiated by:  
- 
The approx. 2 log decrease vs placebo in the 10 days monotherapy, as observed with other INI 
(dolutegravir and bictegravir) monotherapy studies  
-  No  relevant  DDI  between  cabotegravir  and  rilpivirine  was  seen,  which  is  supportive  for  using 
these two ARV in combination  
More importantly, the non-inferiority of the virologic suppression under cabotegravir IM and rilpivirine 
IM was demonstrated versus the continuation of the combined antiretroviral regimen in the control arm 
of  the  two  large  randomised  controlled  pivotal  FLAIR  and  ATLAS  studies.  Indeed,  in  virologically-
suppressed subjects, the difference in the percentages of patients with loss of virologic suppression (HIV 
RNA  >50  copies/ml)  at  48  weeks  (pooling  data  of  studies  FLAIR  and  ATLAS)  was  0.2  (95%  CI:  -1.4, 
1.7),  with  results  well  below  the  pre-defined  4%  non-inferiority  margin  for  pooled  studies  and  with 
consistency on the ITT and PP analyses.  
In addition, the applicant has newly provided as part of the response to the D120 LOQ the 48 weeks 
efficacy data of the ATLAS 2M comparing an Q4W to a Q8W regimen in virologically suppressed 
patients. The every 2 months regimen (Q8W) was shown to be non-inferior to the Q4W regimen in this 
study. The difference in the percentages of patients (Q8W - Q4W regimen) with loss of virologic 
suppression at 48 weeks was 0.8 (95% CI: -0.6, 2.2), with results below the pre-defined 4% non-
inferiority margin and with consistency between the ITT and PP analyses and with the results of FLAIR 
and ATLAS studies. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Patient population 
The  wording  of  the  therapeutic  indication  as  initially  proposed  by  the  applicant  was  not  considered 
acceptable since not adequately conservative. Indeed, patients with baseline NNRTI resistance mutations 
(except for K103N which was allowed) or INI resistance mutations were excluded from participation in 
the pivotal studies. The applicant ultimately revised the indication in response to the CHMP concern. 
Subgroup analyses.  
Somewhat higher virological failure rates were observed in some demographic categories, i.e. females, 
subjects with high BMI, subjects from Russian Federation. This was observed in both studies, as well as 
in the pooled analysis and also in ATLAS-2M study.  Baseline disease characteristics associated with a 
somewhat  worse  outcome  were  infection  with  HIV-1  Subtype  A1  or  AG.  It  cannot  be  ruled  out  that 
external factors, such as HIV subtype or the circulation of HIV variants with certain viral mutations (such 
as L74I), may have an impact on outcome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020

Virologic failure and resistance development.  
Virologic failure rates were low in the clinical studies, and adherence to the visit schedule was high. As 
stated in a recent publication (Oliveira and al, Retrovirology 2018), the development of Q148R/K with 
CAB  can  result  in  high  level  of  cross  resistance  to  all  INI.  It  is  nevertheless  expected  that  rescue  in 
patients  loosing  virologic  suppression  under  the  dual  LA  maintenance  therapy  will  be  managed  by 
boosted protease inhibitors. In response to the D120 issues to be addressed, the applicant agreed to 
conduct a drug utilisation study (DUS).  This prospective observational cohort study will aim to better 
understand  the  patient  population  receiving  CAB+RPV  LA  regimen  in  routine  clinical  practice,  usage 
patterns and post marketing clinical effectiveness of this regimen. One of the key endpoints of the DUS 
is  to  assess  durability  and  discontinuation of  CAB+RPV  regimen  and  the  ARV  regimen  after  switching 
from CAB+RPV. Non-adherence to the dosing schedule, the clinical effectiveness (i.e. proportion patients 
experiencing virologic failure) will also be assessed, and every effort will be made to monitor resistance 
in patients who switched off CAB+RPV regimen.  It is important that patients should be switched to an 
alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the final injection of 
CAB + RPV LA. If not adequately treated with an appropriate oral ARV regimen, patients will be at high 
risk  of  virologic  failure,  due  to  prolonged  exposure  to  subtherapeutic  levels  of  CAB  and  RPV,  and 
subsequent  resistance  development.  The  risk  of  selection  (and  potential  transmission)  of  dual  class 
resistant virus is a source of particular concern with the use of this dual LA regimen. A prospective cohort 
study  (COMBINE-2)  is  proposed  in  collaboration  with  the  NEAT  ID  network.  The  study  will  test  for 
resistance and will monitor for emergence of resistance among those who discontinue the CAB+RPV LA 
regimen and have virologic failure while on subsequent ARV regimen. 
Further,  according  to  the  HIV  SAG  the  currently  proposed  text  in  the  SmPC  suffices  to  allow  proper 
patient  selection  (adequate  observance),  and  no  additional  measures  such  as  patient  alert  card,  an 
electronic or mobile app reminder system for patients to manage properly discontinuation of treatment 
for  the  safe  and effective use  of this  first novel injectable  regimen  can  be  mandatory  in  all  European 
countries. Tools should be decided at the national level depending on the Health system organisation. 
Limitations of the clinical data in support of the Q8W regimen 
In response to the D120, the applicant has proposed, next to the Q4W regimen, to also include the Q8W 
regimen as a treatment option. In ATLAS-2M study, the rate of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/ml at 
Week 48, and especially the rate of confirmed virologic failure (CVF), is numerically higher in the Q8W 
group (8 subjects) than in the Q4W group (2 subjects). Most of them (10/14 subjects, including 7/10 
subjects experiencing CVF) had no prior exposure to CAB + RPV.  
This could suggest an inadequate CAB and/or RPV exposure at the beginning of treatment or differential 
resistance pattern at baseline. The applicant was requested to discuss an optimised dosing regimen that 
could start with Q4W dosing until therapeutic concentrations of CAB and RPV have been reached e.g. by 
monthly  dosing  at  least  for  the  first 6  months  followed  by  Q8W  dosing.  The  applicant  did not  further 
discuss the possibility of starting with a Q4W regimen for at least 6 months before switching to a Q8W 
regimen, but provided simulations for switch from Q4 to Q8 week regimen and vice versa. Reassuringly, 
the RPV concentrations remain below the levels that have been associated with QT prolongation. Steady 
state  concentrations  are  decreasing  after  switch  from  Q4W  to  Q8W  regimen,  however,  prediction 
intervals are overlapping, and the concentrations remain above the PAIC90 values. The input of the HIV 
SAG on questions pertaining to this newly introduced Q8W was requested. The experts considered that 
there  is  enough  evidence  to  support  Q8W  dosing  taking  into  account  that  there  were  not  significant 
differences between Q8W and Q4W regimens in the different studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
both regimens seem to have comparable efficacy. However, it was also highlighted that there are still 
some concerns regarding the subgroup of patients on Q8W dosing who showed more risk of virological 
failure (VF). For patients who could have higher risk of VF it was remarked that starting with the Q4W 
Assessment report  
EMA/586324/2020  
Page 131/140 
 
 
 
regimen should be considered to minimise the risk of virological failure. In these cases, switching to a 
Q8W dosing could be considered afterwards in patients who reach and maintain undetectability with this 
regimen.   
Based on the multivariable analyses the applicant has identified risk factors of virologic failure, i.e. at 
least 2 of the following baseline factors: rilpivirine resistance mutations identified by proviral resistance 
testing, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI>30 mg/m2. This information has been incorporated in section 5.1 
of the SmPC plus an additional warning in section 4.4 (with cross reference to section 5.1). 
Limitations of the clinical data in support of the oral bridging 
There are currently limited clinical data in support of the oral bridging with CAB + RPV in view of the 
limited number of patients by study who used oral bridging (only 16 missed injections with oral 
bridging across FLAIR (n=9) and ATLAS (n=7) studies). This will be further substantiated in post-
approval.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Besides the hepatotoxicity, cutaneous reactions, psychiatric adverse events (already including suicidal 
ideation) in common with other representatives of the INI class, the safety profile of CAB LA is 
characterised by injection site reactions. ISRs AES were expected with CAB and RPV administered by 
intramuscular injection. Most ISRs are grade 1 or 2 with less than 1% of ISRs in phase III studies 
classified as grade 3 (or 4) and less than 1% of ISRs leading to ME withdrawal. Most ISRs reported are 
pain but there have been also nodule, induration, swelling, erythema and pruritus reported at a 
significant frequency. Most ISRs in phase III studies resolved within 14 days with a median duration of 
3 days but 17% of subjects experienced ISRs lasting more than 14 days. Moreover “sequelae” were 
reported in 4% of subjects mainly relating to prolonged injection site pain.  
CAB is glucuruno- conjugated and could potentially lead to increased bilirubin by competition with the 
transporter. However, only mild hyperbilirubinemia is reported so far without clinical manifestations. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Design. Although an open-label switch design is acceptable, the interpretation of the safety results is 
not as straight forward as it would have been in case a double-blind trial design had been used, as 
reporting rates of adverse events can be influenced by knowledge of the allocated treatment. Also, 
subjects who have been randomised to the comparator arm continued on a treatment that they 
already tolerated; hence less adverse events are expected in this arm than in the CAB + RPV arm. 
Imbalances between the treatment groups in the incidence of AEs reported for several SOCs were 
observed. These were mainly introduced by the occurrence of injection side reactions in the CAB + RPV 
group.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While Vocabria LA in combination with Rekambys LA is not expected to answer an unmet medical need, 
it is proposed for convenience to remove the constraints of an oral daily administration of combined 
antiretroviral regimen. Moreover, this maintenance regimen is a NRTI-sparing regimen, with 
expectations that NRTI-associated long-term toxicities can be reduced or avoided. 
Although there are some uncertainties regarding the use of the long-acting formulation of RPV in 
clinical practice, it has been shown that, if used according to the proposed SmPC, RPV LA together with 
CAB LA is able to keep HIV-1 viral load suppressed in the majority of patients (>93%) with low rates 
of virologic failure (<2.2%). 
It is questionable if the population included in these clinical studies is representative of the patients 
that may be treated in clinical practice. It can be expected that the future patient population may also 
include subjects with, for a variety of reasons, difficulties to adhere to the monthly injections, and even 
more to every two months injections. Therefore, it is considered important to ensure that patients 
understand the need of strict adherence to the monthly/every two months injections, especially during 
the initial period before steady-state exposures are reached, and that they understand that due to the 
long-acting properties of this regimen, a so called drug holiday (a period during which a patient does 
not take his/her medication) should at all times be avoided due to the slowly waning exposures that 
result in subtherapeutic CAB and RPV levels that will surely result in the selection of resistance-
associated mutations. Overall, while this regimen is NOT advisable for patients with adherence issues 
to oral therapy, as might initially be thought, there is a need to clearly warn physicians on the 
adequate selection of candidates to this dual LA regimen. Patients and their treating physicians should 
be aware that after discontinuation of treatment with CAB + RPV LA, an oral antiviral regimen is 
definitely needed as concentrations of these agents may remain in the circulation for several years, 
increasing the risk of resistance. 
The SmPC/PL have been revised to address those issues and post authorisations measures have been 
proposed as part of the RMP (DUS).  
The input of a HIV SAG was received to notably ensure that adequate safeguards have been put in 
place to minimise the risk of emergence of resistance associated with treatment discontinuation/issues 
of adherence of this LA regimen. Input of the SAG was also requested on the extent both Q4W and 
Q8W can equally be considered. The experts remarked that the Q8W and Q4W seem to be equally 
effective. However, special considerations should be given to patients who might have higher risk of 
virological failure on Q8W considering the current data. Further, adherence was considered a key 
element and should be reinforced, however, there is not a unique tool to ensure good adherence to 
treatment. Hence, measures should be adapted to the centres, resources, patients’ characteristics etc. 
Finally, the experts recommend that a non-interventional post approval study on this CAB+RPV LA 
regimen is necessary to complement the data from existing registries. Such a study will substantiate 
real life settings since the clinical trials supporting the dossier were performed in very selected study 
populations. This post marketing study will be pivotal to monitor adherence and collect data on 
virological suppression, using appropriate threshold (i.e. plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <50 c/mL instead of 
<200 c/mL) to avoid waiting for virological failure while on CAB+RPV LA regimen. In addition, patient 
and physician preferences/selection criteria for long acting therapy should be recorded. The experts

strongly recommend for such a post approval study to be performed whilst acknowledging that 
challenges in getting reliable data on resistance will occur. 
The applicant has committed to perform two post approval studies to keep scrutiny on the adequate 
use of this first LA regimen (to be used in combination with Rekambys LA regimen with parallel and 
linked Marketing Application) and responding to the CHMP/PRAC concerns, a DUS under the umbrella 
of Eurosida as a PASS and a COMBINE-2 study as a PAES under the umbrella of the NEAT, both 
capture information on adherence and resistance, but the DUS as a PASS will be more directed 
towards collecting information on medication errors and usage pattern. The SAG input has been taking 
into account for the threshold of viral load to capture the loss of virologic suppression (i.e. 50 
copies/ml). Both non interventional studies are aimed at further substantiating the benefit/risk ratio of 
the drug (given the potential individual risk and collective risk through transmission of dual NNRTI and 
INI resistance in case of inadequate handling) in a real life setting and thus will be imposed. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
As stated in therapeutic guidelines, the primary concern when switching should be to sustain and not 
to jeopardise virologic suppression. To that purpose, it is critical to be conservative in delineating the 
targeted population for maintenance therapy. Thus, the applicant has revised the indication of Vocabria 
IM as proposed in the D150 MO:  
Vocabria injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, for the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
<50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance 
to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class  (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Although there are some uncertainties regarding the use of the long-acting formulation of Vocabria in 
clinical practice, it has been shown that, if used according to the proposed SmPC, Vocabria LA together 
with RPV LA is able to keep HIV-1 viral load suppressed in the majority of patients (>93%) with low 
rates of virologic failure (<2.2%). As the safety profile of Vocabria is acceptable, it can be concluded 
that from a clinical perspective, the balance of benefits and risks for Vocabria is positive, provided 
adequate post-authorisation follow-up.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vocabria is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

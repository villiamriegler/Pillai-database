Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The  applicant  submitted  to  the  CPMP  a  request  for  an  accelerated  procedure  dated  26 
November  2002  according  to  the  CPMP  guidance  on  “accelerated  evaluation  of  products 
indicated  for  serious  diseases  (life-threatening  or  heavy  disabling  diseases),  CPMP/495/96” 
rev.1 dated 18 September 2001. The CPMP, during its 17 – 18 December 2002 meeting, agreed 
to  consider  the  possibility  to  adopt  rapidly  an  opinion  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the 
Rapporteur and Co-rapporteur in their respective Assessment Reports.  
The procedure started on 6 January 2003. 
The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CPMP members on 20 February 
2003.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  Assessment  Report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  members  on 
11 March 2003. 
During the meeting on 23-25 April 2003, the CPMP, on the basis of the recommendation of the 
Rapporteur and Co-rapporteur in their respective Assessment Reports, agreed that the data did 
not support a rapid adoption of an opinion. The CPMP agreed therefore on the consolidated List 
of Questions to be sent to the applicant. The final consolidated List of Questions was sent to the 
applicant on 25 April 2003. 
The  applicant  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  List  of  Questions  on 
14 May 2003. 
The summary report of the inspection carried out at the manufacturing site for the oral solution 
between 3 and 6 June 2003 was issued on 18 July 2003. 
The  Rapporteur/co-rapporteur  circulated  the  response  Assessment  Report  on  the  applicant’s 
responses to the List of Questions to all CPMP members on 26 June 2003.

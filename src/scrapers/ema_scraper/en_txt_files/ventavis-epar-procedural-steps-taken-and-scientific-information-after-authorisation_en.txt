Symptoms 
Cases of overdose were reported. Symptoms of overdoses 
are mainly related to the vasodilatory effect of iloprost. 
Frequently observed symptoms following overdose are 
dizziness, headache, flushing, nausea, jaw pain or back 
pain. Hypotension, an increase of blood pressure, 
bradycardia or tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea and limb 
pain might also be possible.

Update of section 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order

SmPC, Annex 
The MAH provided a safety review of palpitation, 
to align the product information with the Company

tachycardia, peripheral oedema and nasal congestion in 
Core Data Sheet. The Package Leaflet was updated 
and PL 
view to add these adverse events in the section 4.8 of the 
accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9.0 and changes have 
been made throughout the SmPC to align with the 
SmPC guideline 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
SmPC.   
Causality of iloprost in reported post marketing cases of 
tachycardia and palpitations is not clear. However, the role 
of iloprost, as a vasodilator, cannot be excluded. The CHMP 
therefore agreed to adding tachycardia and palpitations in 
the section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of “common”. 
With regards to peripheral oedema, even if a possible 
pharmacologic mechanism is suggested, the CHMP 
considers that the data provided do not allow to clearly 
establishing a relationship between the occurrence of 
peripheral oedema, and the statement currently in the 
SmPC is considered appropriate with no changes 
warranted. The CHMP did agree however to the inclusion of 
peripheral oedema in section 4.8. with a frequency of  
“very common”, as even if the data provided does not allow 
to establish a clear relationship between the occurrence of 
peripheral oedema it is a fact that the role of iloprost 
cannot be formally excluded 
Regarding "nasal congestion", the current data provided do 
not allow to clearly establishing a relationship, therefore 
Page 10/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this ADR has not been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
In addition to these changes, during the procedure the 
CHMP commented that given the available data and the 
very limited treatment alternatives for paediatric patients 
with PAH that is a life threatening disease, it would be 
counterproductive and confusing to the prescriber and 
patient to introduce a recommendation against the use of 
Ventavis in adolescents and paediatric patients. In addition 
to this the statement is not in line with the SmPC guideline. 
In light of these considerations the statement “Ventavis is 
not recommended for use in this population” was to be 
deleted from section 4.2 of the SmPC, and the package 
leaflet amended accordingly. 
This review does not change the benefit/risk balance.

efficacy, including all variations introduced since the

marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considers 
by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ventavis in 
the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension 
remains favourable.  
The CHMP also concludes that the specific obligation to 
conduct a post-authorisation safety study to assess the 
clinical effects, safety and tolerability, and survival during 
long-term Ventavis inhalation therapy over at least 2 years 
and up to 4 years in a usual care setting had been fulfilled.  
The efficacy data from this study support results from 
randomised clinical trials and the observed safety profile for 
Ventavis in this study was expected and in line with 
information mentioned in the current label. No safety signal 
emerged from this observational study. In view of these 
results the CHMP recommends the renewal of the

4.9, 5.1 to 5.3, 6.6 and 10 has been made. Important 
changes which should be highlighted were those made to: 
- Sections 4.2. and 4.4. relating to patients with renal 
impairment: change to reflect that patients with creatinine 
clearance of ?30ml/min should follow the same dosing 
recommendations as patients with hepatic impairment.  
- Section 4.4 relating to syncope: changes made to give 
more detail and alert physicians to the fact that the 
presence of concomitant conditions or medicines may 
increase the risk of syncope. 
- Section 4.5. relating to concomitant use of vasodilators 
and antihypertensive agents: wording of the section has 
been amended to reflect the potential increase in risk of 
hypotension when these medicines are administered 
together. 
- Section 4.5. relating to concomitant use of other platelet 
Page 14/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibitors: the section has been reworded to draw attention 
to the theoretically increased risk of bleeding. 
 -Section 4.8. - formal revision of this section as follows: 
-- The frequencies of ADRs from clinical trials given in 
crude incidences instead of comparative incidences (iloprost 
vs. placebo/control). 
--  For the ADRs as provided in the section "post-marketing 
experience" the study data was reviewed to see whether a 
frequency could be determined. ADRs from spontaneous 
reporting for which no frequency could be determined 
following this approach, are included in the table under the 
category 'frequency unknown'. 
-- When appropriate, ADRs from clinical trials and from 
post marketing experience have been listed in one table. 
- Section 5.1. - a short description of the STEP study 
(C200-002) with the objective to mention the lack of new 
adverse effects or acute signal of any adverse effects when 
Ventavis is associated to bosentan. Additional text has been 
included but stressing that the STEP study was not 
designed or powered to assess long-term efficacy and 
tolerance of the combination.

Authorisation Holder and having re-assessed the

Based on the review of the available information the CHMP

is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and

sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Ventavis continues to be favourable. 
However, based upon the safety profile of the product 
which requires close monitoring of several adverse events, 
and since a specific obligation to provide long-term data on 
the safety and efficacy of Ventavis is not yet fulfilled, the 
CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal 
on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds is required. 
In addition, the CHMP decided that the MAH should 
continue to submit yearly PSURs.

"Peripheral oedema is a very common symptom of the 
disease itself, but can also occur under therapy. The 
occurrence of peripheral oedema can be related to the 
deterioration of the disease or insufficient effectiveness of 
the product."

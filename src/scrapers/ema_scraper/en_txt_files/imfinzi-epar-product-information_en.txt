CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
IMFINZI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour cells and whose 
disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy (see section 5.1).
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the 
first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK 
positive mutations.
Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC)
IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of 
adults with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of cancer.

a  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: 
aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal; BLV: baseline value.
b For patients with alternative cause follow the recommendations for AST or ALT increases without concurrent 
bilirubin elevations.
c  If AST and ALT are less than or equal to ULN at baseline in patients with liver involvement, withhold or 
permanently discontinue durvalumab based on recommendations for hepatitis with no liver involvement.
d  Adverse drug reaction is only associated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab.
7
e   If no improvement within 2 to 3 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive 
therapy. Upon resolution (Grade 0), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 
month.
f   Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if adverse reaction does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there 
are signs of respiratory insufficiency.
g  With the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to discontinue should be 
based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment.
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to 
confirm aetiology or exclude alternate aetiologies. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, 
IMFINZI and/or tremelimumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Increasing dose 
of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants should be considered if there 
is worsening or no improvement. Upon improvement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be 
initiated and continued over at least 1 month. After withhold, IMFINZI and/or tremelimumab can be 
resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions improved to ≤ Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose 
has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. IMFINZI and tremelimumab should be 
permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 (severe) immune-mediated adverse reactions and for 
any Grade 4 (life-threatening) immune-mediated adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that 
are controlled with replacement hormones.
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.1).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of IMFINZI is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population
(see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of IMFINZI is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment. Data from patients with severe hepatic impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on 
this population (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of IMFINZI in children and adolescents aged below 18 years of age have not 
been established. No data are available.
Method of administration
IMFINZI is for intravenous use. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion solution over 1 
hour (see section 6.6).
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy
When IMFINZI is administered in combination with chemotherapy, administer IMFINZI prior to 
chemotherapy on the same day.
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy
When IMFINZI is administered in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy, tremelimumab is given first, followed by IMFINZI and then platinum-based 
chemotherapy on the same day of dosing.
When IMFINZI is administered in combination with a fifth dose of tremelimumab and pemetrexed 
maintenance therapy at week 16, tremelimumab is given first, followed by IMFINZI and then 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy on the same day of dosing.
8
IMFINZI, tremelimumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as separate intravenous 
infusions. IMFINZI and tremelimumab are each given over 1 hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, 
refer to the SmPC for administration information. For pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the 
SmPC for administration information. Separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion should be 
used.
During cycle 1, tremelimumab is to be followed by IMFINZI starting approximately 1 hour (maximum 
2 hours) after the end of the tremelimumab infusion. Platinum-based chemotherapy infusion should 
start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the IMFINZI infusion. If there are no 
clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the physician’s discretion, subsequent cycles of 
IMFINZI can be given immediately after tremelimumab and the time period between the end of the 
IMFINZI infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab
When IMFINZI is administered in combination with tremelimumab, administer tremelimumab prior to 
IMFINZI on the same day. IMFINZI and tremelimumab are administered as separate intravenous 
infusions. Refer to the SmPC for tremelimumab dosing information.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Immune-mediated pneumonitis
Immune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic 
corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab (see section 4.8). 
Pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis
Radiation pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and 
the clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the PACIFIC 
Study, in patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation 
within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 
161 (33.9%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 58 (24.8%) in the placebo group, including 
Grade 3 (3.4% vs. 3.0%) and Grade 5 (1.1% vs. 1.7%).
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis. 
Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and 
disease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated hepatitis
Immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear 
alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Monitor alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total 
bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels prior to initiation of treatment and prior to each subsequent 
infusion. Additional monitoring is to be considered based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated 
hepatitis should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.
9
Immune-mediated colitis
Immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no 
clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Adverse drug reactions of intestinal perforation and large intestine 
perforation were reported in patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab. Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and
managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies
Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis
Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis occurred in patients receiving 
IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, and hypothyroidism may follow 
hyperthyroidism (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function tests 
prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-
mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed as recommended in 
section 4.2.
Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency
Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in 
combination with tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be 
managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 
1 diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed as 
recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated hypophysitis/hypopituitarism
Immune-mediated hypophysitis or hypopituitarism occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for 
clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For symptomatic hypophysitis or 
hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated nephritis
Immune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear 
alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to 
and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and 
managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated rash
Immune-mediated rash or dermatitis (including pemphigoid), defined as requiring use of systemic 
corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or dermatitis and managed as recommended in
section 4.2.
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Immune-mediated myocarditis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs 
and symptoms of immune-mediated myocarditis and managed as recommended in section 4.2. 
10
Immune-mediated pancreatitis
Immune-mediated pancreatitis, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with
tremelimumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and
symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions
Given the mechanism of action of IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, other 
potential immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse 
reactions have been observed in patients treated with IMFINZI monotherapy or IMFINZI in 
combination with tremelimumab: myasthenia gravis, myelitis transverse, myositis, polymyositis,
meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia and cystitis 
noninfective (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as 
recommended in section 4.2.
Infusion-related reactions
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Severe infusion-
related reactions have been reported in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab (see section 4.8). Infusion-related reactions should be managed as recommended in 
section 4.2
Disease-specific precaution (BTC)
Cholangitis and biliary tract infections
Cholangitis and biliary tract infections are not uncommon in patients with advanced BTC. Cholangitis 
events were reported in TOPAZ-1 in both treatment groups (14.5% [IMFINZI + chemotherapy] vs. 
8.2% [placebo + chemotherapy]); these were mostly in association with biliary stents and were not 
immune-mediated in aetiology. Patients with BTC (especially those with biliary stents) should be 
closely monitored for development of cholangitis or biliary tract infections before initiation of 
treatment and, regularly, thereafter.
Metastatic NSCLC
Limited data are available in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) treated with IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Careful consideration of 
the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended.
Patients excluded from clinical studies
Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: a baseline ECOG performance score 
≥ 2; active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history 
of immunodeficiency; a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that 
required systemic immunosuppression, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids 
(≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent); uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses; active tuberculosis or 
hepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or 
after the start of IMFINZI. In the absence of data, durvalumab should be used with caution in these 
populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.
The safety of concurrent prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) with IMFINZI in patients with 
ES-SCLC is unknown.
For more information on exclusion criteria for each specific study see section 5.1.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting durvalumab, except 
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not 
recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
11
of durvalumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after
starting durvalumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).
No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab.
Since the primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial 
system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. PK drug-drug 
interaction between durvalumab and chemotherapy was assessed in the CASPIAN study and showed 
concomitant treatment with durvalumab did not impact the PK of etoposide, carboplatin or cisplatin. 
Additionally, based on population PK analysis, concomitant chemotherapy treatment did not
meaningfully impact the PK of durvalumab. PK drug-drug interactions between durvalumab in 
combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON 
study and showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-
paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with
durvalumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab.
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of durvalumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, 
durvalumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy, and in a mouse allogeneic 
pregnancy model, disruption of PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. 
Animal studies with durvalumab are not indicative of reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human 
IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and placental transfer of durvalumab was confirmed in 
animal studies. Durvalumab may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective 
contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether durvalumab is secreted in human breast milk. Available toxicological data in 
cynomolgus monkeys have shown low levels of durvalumab in breast milk on day 28 after birth (see 
section 5.3). In humans, antibodies may be transferred to breast milk, but the potential for absorption 
and harm to the newborn is unknown. However, a potential risk to the breast-fed child cannot be 
excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue or abstain
from durvalumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit 
of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
There are no data on the potential effects of durvalumab on fertility in humans or animals. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Durvalumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile

Description of selected adverse reactions
IMFINZI is associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe 
reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy and/or treatment modifications. 
The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions reflect the IMFINZI monotherapy 
combined safety database of 3 006 patients which includes the PACIFIC Study and additional studies 
in patients with various solid tumours, in indications for which durvalumab is not approved. Across all 
studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks or 
1 500 mg every 3 or 4 weeks. Details for the significant adverse reactions for IMFINZI when given in 
combination with chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in 
comparison to IMFINZI monotherapy. 
The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions are also based on 2 280 patients who 
received IMFINZI 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg or IMFINZI 
1 500 mg in combination with tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks. Details for the significant adverse 
reactions for IMFINZI when given in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based 
18
chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison to IMFINZI in 
combination with tremelimumab. 
The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions also reflect the IMFINZI in 
combination with tremelimumab 300 mg combined safety database of 462 patients with HCC (the 
HCC pool). In these two studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 1 500 mg in combination 
with tremelimumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.
The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in section 4.2 and 4.4.

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity of IMFINZI as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 2 280 patients who were 
treated with IMFINZI 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks as a single-agent and 
evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Sixty-nine patients (3.0%) tested positive 
for treatment emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) against durvalumab were detected in 
0.5% (12/2 280) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on safety.
There are insufficient number of patients to determine ADA impact on efficacy. Based on population 
PK analysis, slightly lower exposure are expected in ADA-positive patients however, the reduction of 
PK exposure is less than 30% compared to a typical patient and is not considered clinically relevant.
Across multiple phase III studies, in patients treated with IMFINZI in combination with other 
therapeutic agents, 0% to 10.1% of patients developed treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing 
antibodies against durvalumab were detected in 0% to 1.7% of patients treated with IMFINZI in 
combination with other therapeutic agents. The presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on 
pharmacokinetics or safety.
Elderly
No overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients.
In studies PACIFIC, CASPIAN and TOPAZ-1 data on safety for patients 75 years and older are too 
limited to draw a conclusion on this population.
In first line metastatic NSCLC patients in the POSEIDON study, some differences in safety were 
reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of 
age or older are limited to a total of 74 patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse 
reactions and discontinuation rate of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 
75 years of age or older treated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older 
who received platinum-based chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no information on overdose with durvalumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely 
monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug 
conjugates, PD-1/PDL-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1/death ligand 1) inhibitors. ATC code: 
L01FF03
Mechanism of action
Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that 
helps tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 can be induced by 
inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and 
tumour-associated immune cells in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and 
activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces 
cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation and cytokine production.
Durvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that 
selectively blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Durvalumab does not induce 
antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Selective blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and 
PD-L1/CD80 interactions enhances antitumour immune responses and increases T-cell activation. 
The combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor and durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor functions 
to enhance anti-tumour T-cell activation and function at multiple stages of the immune response
resulting in improved anti-tumour responses. In murine syngeneic tumour models, dual blockade of 
PD-L1 and CTLA-4 resulted in enhanced anti-tumour activity.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1 500 mg every 4 weeks were evaluated in NSCLC 
and ES-SCLC clinical studies. Based on the modeling and simulation of exposure, exposure-safety 
relationships and exposure-efficacy data comparisons, there are no anticipated clinically significant 
differences in efficacy and safety between durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1 500 mg 
every 4 weeks.
NSCLC – PACIFIC Study
The efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC Study, a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 713 patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. 
Patients had completed at least 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemotherapy with radiation 
therapy within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study and had a ECOG performance status of 0 or 
1. Ninety-two percent of patients had received a total dose of 54 to 66 Gy of radiation. The study 
excluded patients who had progressed following chemoradiation therapy, patients with prior exposure 
to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody, patients with active or prior documented autoimmune 
disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history of immunodeficiency; a history of severe 
25
immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression, 
except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV 
infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of 
IMFINZI. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 10 mg/kg IMFINZI (n=476) or 10 mg/kg placebo 
(n=237) via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or 
confirmed disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by gender, age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 
years) and smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker). Patients with disease control at 12 months were 
given the option to be re-treated upon disease progression. Tumour assessments were conducted every 
8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 expression level. Where available, archival 
tumour tissue specimens taken prior to chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively tested for PD-L1 
expression on tumour cells (TC) using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) IHC assay. Of the 713 patients 
randomised, 63% of patients provided a tissue sample of sufficient quality and quantity to determine 
PD-L1 expression and 37% were unknown.
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. 
Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (70%), age ≥ 65 years 
(45%), age ≥ 75 years (8%), White (69%), Asian (27%), other (4%), current smoker (16%), 
past-smoker (75%), never smoker (9%), ECOG Performance Status 0 (49%), ECOG Performance 
Status 1 (51%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IIIA (53%), Stage IIIB (45%), 
histological sub-groups of squamous (46%), non-squamous (54%). Of 451 patients with PD-L1 
expression available, 67% were TC ≥ 1% [PD-L1 TC 1-24% (32%), PD-L1 TC ≥ 25% (35%)] and 
33% were TC < 1%.
The two primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
of IMFINZI vs. placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS at 12 months (PFS 12) and 
18 months (PFS 18) from randomisation and Time from Randomisation to Second Progression (PFS2). 
PFS was assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the IMFINZI-treated group 
compared with the placebo group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.65), p < 0.0001]. The 
study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in the IMFINZI-treated group
compared with the placebo group [HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.87), p = 0.00251].
In the 5 year follow-up analysis, with a median follow-up of 34.2 months, IMFINZI continued to 
demonstrate improved OS and PFS compared to placebo. The OS and PFS results from the primary 
analysis and the follow-up analysis are summarized in Table 5.

The improvements in PFS and OS in favour of patients receiving IMFINZI compared to those 
receiving placebo were consistently observed in all predefined subgroups analysed, including 
ethnicity, age, gender, smoking history, EGFR mutation status and histology.
Post-hoc subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression
Additional subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the efficacy by tumour PD-L1 expression 
(≥ 25%, 1-24%, ≥ 1%, < 1%) and for patients whose PD-L1 status cannot be established (PD-L1 
28
    
 
 
    
 
unknown). PFS and OS results from the 5 year follow-up analysis are summarised in Figures 3, 4, 5 
and 6.

Patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
Patient-reported symptoms, function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were collected using 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The LC13 and C30 were 
assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks until completion 
of the treatment period or discontinuation of IMFINZI due to toxicity or disease progression. 
Compliance was similar between the IMFINZI and placebo treatment groups (83% vs. 85.1% overall 
of evaluable forms completed).
At baseline, no differences in patient-reported symptoms, function and HRQoL were observed 
between IMFINZI and placebo groups. Throughout the duration of the study to Week 48, there was no 
clinically meaningful difference between IMFINZI and placebo groups in symptoms, functioning and 
HRQoL (as assessed by a difference of greater than or equal to 10 points).
NSCLC – POSEIDON Study
POSEIDON was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI with or without tremelimumab
in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. POSEIDON was a randomised, open-label, 
multicenter study in 1013 metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitising epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. 
Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC were eligible for 
enrolment. Patients had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. 
Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 status confirmed by using the Ventana PD-L1 
(SP263) assay. Patients had a World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment.
The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or 
untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic 
immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of IMFINZI or tremelimumab, except
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; 
or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI and/or 
tremelimumab (see section 4.4).
Randomisation was stratified by tumour cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% vs. TC < 50%), 
disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB, per the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer), 
and histology (non-squamous vs. squamous).
Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:
 Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg with tremelimumab 75 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy 
every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by, IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy. A 
fifth dose of tremelimumab 75 mg was given at Week 16 alongside IMFINZI dose 6.
 Arm 2: IMFINZI 1 500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, 
followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy.
 Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients could receive 
2 additional cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomisation), as clinically indicated, at the
Investigator’s discretion.
In the 3 treatment arms, patients received one of the following histology-based chemotherapy 
regimens:
 Non-squamous NSCLC

Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks. Unless contraindicated by the investigator, pemetrexed maintenance could be 
given.

Squamous NSCLC
 Gemcitabine 1 000 or 1 250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or 
carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.
31
 Non-squamous or squamous NSCLC
 Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 
every 3 weeks.
Tremelimumab was given up to a maximum of 5 doses unless there was disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. IMFINZI and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance therapy (when 
applicable) was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then 
every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted 
every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.
The dual primary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for IMFINZI + platinum-based 
chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The key secondary endpoints of the study were 
PFS and OS for IMFINZI + tremelimumab + platinum-based chemotherapy and platinum-based 
chemotherapy alone. The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and Duration of 
Response (DoR). PFS, ORR, and DoR, were assessed using BICR according to RECIST v1.1
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between study arms. 
Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (76.0%), age ≥ 65 years 
(47.1%), age ≥ 75 years (11.3%) median age 64 years (range: 27 to 87 years), White (55.9%), Asian 
(34.6%), Black or African American (2.0%), Other (7.6%), non-Hispanic or Latino (84.2%), current 
smoker or past-smoker (78.0%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (33.4%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (66.5%). Disease 
characteristics were as follows: Stage IVA (50.0%), Stage IVB (49.6%), histological sub-groups of 
squamous (36.9%), non-squamous (62.9%), brain metastases (10.5%), PD-L1 expression TC≥ 50% 
(28.8%), PD-L1 expression TC < 50% (71.1%).
The study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with IMFINZI + tremelimumab + 
platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy. IMFINZI + tremelimumab + 
platinum-based chemotherapy showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs. platinum-
based chemotherapy alone. The results are summarised below.

Hazard Ratio (95% CI)
A total of 75 patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in the IMFINZI in combination with 
tremelimumab and chemotherapy (n=35) and platinum-based chemotherapy only (n=40) arms of the 
POSEIDON study. An exploratory HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was observed for the 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based 
chemotherapy within this study subgroup. Due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup analysis no 
definitive conclusions can be drawn, but caution is suggested when considering this regimen for 
elderly patients.
SCLC – CASPIAN Study
CASPIAN was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI with or without tremelimumab in 
combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin. CASPIAN was a randomized, open-
label, multicentre study in 805 treatment naïve ES-SCLC patients with WHO/ECOG Performance 
status of 0 or 1, body weight > 30 kg, suitable to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as 
first-line treatment for SCLC, with life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks, at least one target lesion by RECIST 
1.1 and adequate organ and bone marrow function. Patients with asymptomatic or treated brain 
metastases were eligible. The study excluded patients with a history of chest radiation therapy; a 
history of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders including paraneoplastic 
syndrome (PNS); active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of systemic 
immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment except physiological dose of 
systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving 
live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI.
Randomisation was stratified by the planned platinum-based (carboplatin or cisplatin) therapy in 
cycle 1. 
Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:
 Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + tremelimumab 75 mg + etoposide and either carboplatin or 
cisplatin
 Arm 2: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin
 Arm 3: Either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/ml/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m2) on Day 1 and 
etoposide (80-100 mg/m2) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for between 
4 – 6 cycles.
34
For patients randomised to Arm 1 and 2, etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin was limited to 4 
cycles on an every 3-week schedule subsequent to randomisation. IMFINZI monotherapy continued
every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of IMFINZI
monotherapy was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and 
deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator.
Patients randomised to Arm 3 were permitted to receive a total of up to 6 cycles of etoposide and 
either carboplatin or cisplatin. After completion of etoposide + platinum, PCI was permitted only in 
Arm 3 per investigator discretion.
Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then 
every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted 
every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.
The primary endpoints of the study were OS of IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs. 
etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3) and IMFINZI + tremelimumab + etoposide + platinum (Arm 1) 
vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3). The key secondary endpoint was PFS. Other secondary 
endpoints were ORR, OS and PFS landmarks and PRO. PFS and ORR were assessed using 
Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1. 
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms
(268 patients in Arm 2 and 269 patients in Arm 3). Baseline demographics of the overall study 
population were as follows: male (69.6%), age ≥ 65 years (39.6%), median age 63 years (range: 28 to 
82 years), white (83.8%), Asian (14.5%), Black or African American (0.9%), other (0.6 %), 
non-Hispanic or Latino (96.1%), current or past-smoker (93.1%), never smoker (6.9%), WHO/ECOG 
PS 0 (35.2%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (64.8%), Stage IV 90.3%, 24.6% of the patients received cisplatin
and 74.1% of the patients received carboplatin. In Arm 3, 56.8% of the patients received 6 cycles of 
etoposide + platinum and 7.8% of the patients received PCI.
At a planned interim (primary) analysis the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
in OS with IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3) 
[HR=0.73 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.909), p=0.0047]. Although not formally tested for significance, IMFINZI 
+ etoposide + platinum demonstrated an improvement in PFS vs. etoposide + platinum alone
[HR=0.78 (95% CI: 0.645, 0.936)].
The PFS, ORR and DoR results from the planned final analysis (DCO: 27 Jan 2020) are summarized 
in Table 7. Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is presented in Figure 11. 
The OS results with the planned long-term OS follow-up analysis (DCO: 22 March 2021) (median
follow-up: 39.3 months) are presented in Table 7. IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs.
etoposide + platinum (Arm 3) continued to demonstrate sustained improvement in OS. Kaplan-Meier 
curve for OS is presented in Figure 10.

Subgroup analysis
The improvements in OS in favour of patients receiving IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum compared to 
those receiving etoposide + platinum alone, were consistently observed across the prespecified
subgroups based on demographics, geographical region, carboplatin or cisplatin use and disease 
characteristics. 
BTC – TOPAZ-1 Study
TOPAZ-1 was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine 
and cisplatin. TOPAZ-1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 
685 patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC (including intrahepatic and extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma) and ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had 
not received previous therapy in the advanced/unresectable setting. Patients who developed recurrent 
disease > 6 months after surgery and/or completion of adjuvant therapy were included. Patients must 
have had an adequate organ and bone marrow function, and have had acceptable serum bilirubin levels 
(≤ 2.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)), and any clinically significant biliary obstruction had to be 
resolved before randomisation.
The study excluded patients with ampullary carcinoma, with brain metastases, active or prior 
documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, HIV infection or active infections, including 
tuberculosis or hepatitis C or patients with current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication 
within 14 days before the first dose of IMFINZI. Patients with active HBV were allowed to participate 
if they were on antiviral therapy.
Randomisation was stratified by disease status (initially unresectable vs. recurrent) and primary 
tumour location (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs. extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs. gallbladder 
carcinoma). 
38
 
 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive:
 Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg administered on Day 1 + gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m2 and cisplatin 
25 mg/m2 (each administered on Days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks (21 days) for up to 8 cycles, 
followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, or
 Arm 2: Placebo administered on Day 1 + gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 
(each administered on Days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks (21 days) for up to 8 cycles, followed by 
placebo every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Tumour assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks after the date of 
randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression.
The primary endpoint of the study was OS, the key secondary endpoint was PFS. Other secondary 
endpoints were ORR, DoR and PRO. PFS, ORR and DoR were investigator-assessed according to 
RECIST v1.1.  
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms 
(341 patients in Arm 1 and 344 patients in Arm 2). Baseline demographics of the overall study 
population were as follows: male (50.4%), age < 65 years (53.3%), white (37.2%), Asian (56.4%), 
Black or African American (2.0%), other (4.2%), non-Hispanic or Latino (93.1%), ECOG PS 0 
(49.1%), vs. PS 1 (50.9%), primary tumour location (intrahepatic bile duct 55.9%, extrahepatic bile 
duct 19.1% and gallbladder 25.0%), disease status [recurrent (19.1%) vs. unresectable (80.7%),
metastatic (86.0%) vs. locally advanced (13.9%)]. PD-L1 expression was evaluated on tumour and 
immune cells using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay and the TAP (tumour area positivity) algorithm, 
58.7% patients had TAP ≥ 1% and 30.1% TAP < 1%.
OS and PFS were formally tested at a pre-planned interim analysis (data cut-off 11 Aug 2021) after a 
median follow-up of 9.8 months. Efficacy results are shown in Table 8 and Figure 13. The maturity for 
OS was 62% and the maturity for PFS was 84%. IMFINZI + chemotherapy (Arm 1) showed 
statistically significant improvement vs. placebo + chemotherapy (Arm 2) in OS and in PFS.

HCC - HIMALAYA Study
The efficacy of IMFINZI given in combination with a single dose of tremelimumab 300 mg was 
evaluated in the HIMALAYA Study, a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in patients with 
confirmed uHCC who did not receive prior systemic treatment for HCC. The study included patients 
with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C or B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) and 
Child-Pugh Score Class A.
The study excluded patients with brain metastases or a history of brain metastases, co-infection of viral 
hepatitis B and hepatitis C; active or prior documented gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 
months; ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months; hepatic encephalopathy 
within 12 months before the start of treatment; active or prior documented autoimmune or 
inflammatory disorders. 
Patients with oesophageal varices were included except those with active or prior documented GI 
bleeding within 12 months prior to study entry. 
Randomisation was stratified by macrovascular invasion (MVI) (yes vs. no), aetiology of liver disease 
(confirmed hepatitis B virus vs. confirmed hepatitis C virus vs. others) and ECOG performance status 
(0 vs. 1). The HIMALAYA study randomized 1171 patients 1:1:1 to receive:
IMFINZI: durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks

 Tremelimumab 300 mg as a single dose + IMFINZI 1 500 mg; followed by IMFINZI 
1 500 mg every 4 weeks
S: Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily

Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks 
thereafter. Survival assessments were conducted every month for the first 3 months following 
treatment discontinuation and then every 2 months. 
The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints included PFS, Investigator-assessed ORR and 
DoR according to RECIST v1.1.
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. The 
baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (83.7%), age < 65 years 
41
 
 
 
 
(50.4%) White (44.6%), Asian (50.7%), Black or African American (1.7%), Other race (2.3%), ECOG 
PS 0 (62.6%); Child-Pugh Class score A (99.5%), macrovascular invasion (25.2%), extrahepatic 
spread (53.4%), baseline AFP < 400 ng/ml (63.7%), baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml (34.5%), viral 
aetiology; hepatitis B (30.6%), hepatitis C (27.2%), uninfected (42.2%), evaluable PD-L1 data 
(86.3%), PD-L1 Tumour area positivity (TAP) ≥ 1% (38.9%), PD-L1 TAP < 1% (48.3%) [Ventana 
PD-L1 (SP263) assay].
Results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 14.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
durvalumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant neoplasms (except 
central nervous system tumours, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms) (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of durvalumab was assessed for IMFINZI as a single agent, in 
combination with chemotherapy, in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab.
The PK of durvalumab was studied in 2903 patients with solid tumours with doses ranging from 0.1 to 
20 mg/kg administered intravenously once every two, three or four weeks as monotherapy. PK 
exposure increased more than dose-proportionally (non-linear PK) at doses < 3 mg/kg, and dose 
proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. 
Based on population PK analysis that included 1878 patients who received durvalumab monotherapy 
in the dose range of  ≥ 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the geometric mean steady state volume of 
distribution (Vss) was 5.64 L. Durvalumab clearance (CL) decreased over time resulting in a geometric 
mean steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.16 ml/h at Day 365; the decrease in CLss was not considered 
clinically relevant. The terminal half-life (t1/2), based on baseline CL, was approximately 18 days. 
There was no clinically meaningful difference between the PK of durvalumab as a single agent, in 
combination with chemotherapy, in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab. The primary elimination pathways of 
durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.
Special populations
Age (19-96 years), body weight (31-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, 
albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1, tumour type, race or ECOG status had 
no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.
Renal impairment
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The 
effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of durvalumab is unknown; 
43
 
 
however, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal 
function is not expected to influence durvalumab exposure.
Hepatic impairment
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any 
AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) had no clinically 
significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
> 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown; however, as IgG 
monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is 
not expected to influence durvalumab exposure.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab has not been evaluated.
Reproductive toxicology
As reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by 
maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus, and in mouse allogeneic pregnancy models 
disruption of PD-L1 signalling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. In animal reproduction 
studies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of 
pregnancy through delivery, at exposure levels approximately 18-times higher than those observed at 
the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC), was associated with placental transfer 
but not with maternal toxicity or effects on embryofoetal development, pregnancy outcome or 
postnatal development. Negligible levels of durvalumab was found in milk of cynomolgous monkey 
on Day 28 after birth.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What IMFINZI is and what it is used for
IMFINZI contains the active substance durvalumab which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. IMFINZI works by helping your immune 
system fight your cancer.

is used alone when your NSCLC:


It is used in combination with tremelimumab and chemotherapy when your NSCLC:

has spread within your lung and cannot be removed by surgery, and
has responded or stabilised after initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
has spread within both your lungs (and/or to other parts of the body), cannot be removed by 
surgery and
has shown no changes (mutations) in genes called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) or 
ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase).

IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is used to treat a type of lung cancer called extensive-
stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in adults. It is used when your SCLC:

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Preparation and administration of the infusion
•
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. The concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to 
slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, 
discoloured or visible particles are observed.
Do not shake the vial.
Withdraw the required volume of concentrate from the vial(s) and transfer into an intravenous
bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or glucose 50 mg/ml
(5%) solution for injection, to prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 
1 to 15 mg/ml. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion.
The medicinal product, once diluted, should be used immediately. The diluted solution must not 
be frozen. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 30 days at 
2 ºC to 8 ºC and for up to 24 hours at room temperature (up to 25 ºC) from the time of 
preparation. 
From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 ºC to 8 ºC or 
12 hours at room temperature (up to 25 ºC), unless dilution has taken place in controlled and 
validated aseptic conditions. 
If refrigerated, intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. 
Administer the infusion solution intravenously over 1 hour using a sterile, low-protein binding 
0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter.
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.
IMFINZI is single-dose. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.

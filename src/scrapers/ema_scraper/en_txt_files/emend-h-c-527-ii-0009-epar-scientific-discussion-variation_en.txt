SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1. 
Introduction 
Emend  is  an  oral  substance  P,  aka  human  neurokinin  1  (NK-1)-receptor  antagonist. 
Mammalian tachykinin substance P (SP) that binds to the NK-1 receptor has been associated 
with  numerous  inflammatory  conditions,  mediation  of  the  emetic  reflex  and  modulation  of 
central  nervous  system  disorders.  By  blocking  NK-1  receptors,  aprepitant  provides  a  novel 
mechanism of action for the prevention of induced nausea and vomiting. 
On  12  November  2003,  the  European  Commission  issued  a  Marketing  Authorisation  valid 
throughout the European Union. The currently approved indication is:  
“Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic 
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. EMEND is given as part of combination therapy”.  
The  purpose  of  this  variation  is  to  broaden  the  indication  to  encompass  emetogenic 
chemotherapies in general. It should be noted that this submission includes one pivotal study 
conducted in patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. No more 
data has thus been submitted in relation to “highly emetogenic” regimens.  
2.  Clinical aspects 
Rationale for the proposed change 
Clinical  studies  of  therapy  for  Chemotherapy  Induced  Nausea  and  Vomiting  (CINV)  are 
classified according to either the degree of emetogenicity of the chemotherapy administered 
or, less frequently, the specific chemotherapy agent or regimen administered. The prototypic 
highly emetogenic chemotherapy is high-dose cisplatin (>50 mg/m2), which, in the absence of 
preventive  therapy,  causes  ≥  95%  of  patients  to  vomit.  Agents  generally  defined  as 
moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapy  include  doxorubicin,  epirubicin,  cyclophosphamide 
and carboplatin. It should be noted that regimens containing more than one emetogenic agent 
are  more  likely  to  induce  symptoms  than  agents  administered  alone  and  that  the  distinction 
between highly and moderately emetogenic is not precisely or consistently defined. 
A  combination  of  a  5-HT3-receptor  antagonist  and  a  corticosteroid  administered  prior  to 
chemotherapy  followed  by  administration  of  one  or  both  agents  for  several  days  is  a 
recommended  regimen  for  the  prevention  of  CINV  after  moderate  to  highly  emetogenic 
chemotherapy regimens. Despite this, the incidence of nausea and vomiting during an initial 
cycle of chemotherapy is at least 30%. In addition, the efficacy of antiemetic therapy tends to 
diminish over subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  
In  support  of  the  proposed  indication,  study  071  comparing  aprepitant  with  a  standard 
regimen  treatment  group  was  submitted  together  with  a  small  exploratory  study,  (044)  as 
discussed in the following sections.

Clinical Pharmacology  
Other  than  biopharmaceutic  studies,  no  new  clinical  pharmacology  data  were  needed  in 
support of this indication. In order to conduct Protocol 071 in double-blind fashion, the 8-mg 
tablets  of  Zofran  (ondansetron)  included  in  the  comparator  regimen  were  over-encapsulated 
and  placebo  ondansetron  capsules  were  made  available  for  the  study  so,  the  active 
ondansetron capsules and the placebo ondansetron capsules were identical in appearance.  
An  ondansetron  bioequivalence  study  compared  the  over-encapsulated  8-mg  tablet  of 
ondansetron with the unencapsulated 8-mg tablet of ondansetron in order to determine if over-
encapsulation altered the biopharmaceutic properties of ondansetron used in Protocol 071.  
Results  demonstrate  that  the  over-encapsulated  tablet  and  the  unencapsulated  tablet  were 
bioequivalent with respect to the rate of absorption, but not bioequivalent with respect to the 
extent of absorption of ondansetron, because the lower limit of the 90% confidence limit (CI) 
for the geometric mean AUC0-∞ ratio for these 2 formulations (0.796) fell slightly below the 
lower bound of the bioequivalence limit of 0.80. 
Clinical Efficacy 
Study  071  is  a  multi-centre,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group  trial  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  and  tolerability  of  an  aprepitant-containing  regimen  for  the  prevention  of  CINV  in 
patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  breast  cancer  requiring  treatment  with  non-cisplatin  moderately 
emetogenic chemotherapy regimens that included cyclophosphamide 750 to 1500 mg/m2, or 
cyclophosphamide  500  to  1500  mg/m2  and  doxorubicin  (≤  60  mg/m2)  or  epirubicin  (≤  100 
mg/m2).  
Patient population 
Patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, naive to chemotherapy Hesketh level ≥3, requiring 
treatment  with  one  of  the  following  moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapy  regimens:  I.V. 
cyclophosphamide (750 to 1500 mg/m2), I.V. cyclophosphamide (500 to 1500 mg/m2) and IV 
doxorubicin  (≤60  mg/m2),  I.V.  cyclophosphamide  (500  to  1500 mg/m2)  and  IV  epirubicin 
(≤100 mg/m2), were included. 
The treatment groups were balanced with regard to demographics, type of malignancy, prior 
and  concomitant  medications,  and  chemotherapeutic  regimens.  Patients  were  randomized  to 
one of 2 treatment groups as shown in table 1.

Study endpoints 
One primary efficacy end point was defined in the protocol to compare the aprepitant regimen 
and  the  standard  regimen  with  respect  to  efficacy  in  the  first  cycle  of  chemotherapy.  The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with complete response, which was defined 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy to treat established nausea or vomiting during the 
5  days  following  the  initiation  of  chemotherapy.  Secondary  end  points  were  the  effects  of 
aprepitant  during  the  acute  and  delayed  phase  of  the  emetogenic  cycle  as  well  as  the 
comparison of the aprepitant regimen and the standard regimen with respect to the Functional 
Living Index—Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire in the first cycle of chemotherapy. 
Clinical response was evaluated with a patient diary that was completed daily for 5 days after 
the administration of chemotherapy. The diary captured all emetic episodes, all use of rescue 
therapy, and a daily nausea severity assessment. In an optional multiple-cycle extension, the 
patient  diary  was  used  to  capture  the  daily  nausea  severity  assessment  for  5  days  after  the 
administration of chemotherapy for each cycle that the patient entered.  In addition, on Day 6, 
the patient recorded whether or not any emetic episodes or nausea occurred since the initiation 
of chemotherapy as well as any use of rescue therapy (only taken for treatment of established 
nausea or emesis). 
Primary statistical analyses were based on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) approach. In 
addition,  a  supportive  per-protocol  analysis  was  done  for  the  primary  efficacy  parameter. 
Results are displayed for each endpoint by treatment group and phase (overall, acute, delayed, 
as well as 0 to 72 hours for nausea endpoints). With 375 evaluable patients per regimen and 
assuming a true response rate with the standard regimen of 52%, this study would have ~80% 
power to detect the superiority of the aprepitant regimen, if the true aprepitant regimen effect 
was  10  percentage  points  higher  than  the  standard  regimen.  If  the  true  difference  was  12 
percentage points, the power would be ~90%.

†  Aprepitant  regimen  versus  standard  regimen  based  on  a  logistic  regression  model 
with  terms  for  treatment  group,  investigator  group,  and  age  category  (<55 years, 
≥55 years).  Because the endpoints for nausea are exploratory, the p-values shown 
for these endpoints are for summary purposes only. 
No Vomiting = no vomiting or retching or dry heaves. 
The complete response rate for the aprepitant regimen group was 50.8%, while a response rate 
of 42.5% was observed with the standard regimen (p = 0.015).  
With  respect  to  complete  response  in  the  acute  phase  (0–24h),  there  was  an  almost  7-
percentage  point  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  (75.7  vs.  69.0%,  odds  ratio=1.40, 
p=0.034). During the delayed phase, the advantage for the aprepitant group was smaller and 
did not reach statistical significance (55.4 vs. 49.1%, odds ratio=1.30, p=0.064).   
In  the  delayed  phase  (>24  hours  to  120  hours  post-chemotherapy  administration),  the 
complete  response  rate  for  the  aprepitant  regimen  was  numerically  higher  than  that  of  the 
standard  regimen,  with  55.4%  for  the  aprepitant  regimen  group  and  49.1%  for  the  standard 
regimen group (p=0.064)

The proportion of patients with no impact of CINV on daily life by treatment group for the 
Cycle  1  mITT  population  is  shown  in  table  5.  Logistic  regression  analysis,  adjusted  for 
treatment  group,  investigator  group,  and  age  category  (<55  year,  ≥55  years),  was  used  to 
determine  statistical  significance  of  the  treatment  difference.  As  assessed  by  the  FLIE  total 
score, 63.5% of the patients in the aprepitant regimen group reported “no impact on daily life” 
compared  to  55.6%  of  the  patients  in  the  standard  regimen  group.  The  treatment  difference 
was significant (p=0.019). 
With regard to the percentage of patients with a complete response in cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 the 
relevant  Kaplan-Meier  curves  show  that  the  cumulative  percentage  of  patients  with  a 
sustained complete response over Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 was greater in the aprepitant regimen 
compared to the standard regimen (p=0.017, Log-rank test). However, as to be expected in the 
light of the introduced bias the efficacy of both aprepitant and standard treatment increased. 
Re-randomization prior to, e.g. cycle two would have been appropriate. Although the efficacy 
(and  superiority)  seemed  to  be  retained,  the  data  obtained  in  cycle  2-4  do  not  allow  any 
conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the two regimens. Results obtained in the cycles 
2-4 are not mentioned in the SPC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Supportive study 044.  
This is a small (n=55) exploratory study, which was conducted between September 1999 and 
February  2001.  The  study  was  originally  planned  as  a  three-armed  trial  including  a  dose 
comparative element (aprepitant 375 vs. 125 mg). The high dose group was closed early after 
the enrolment of 2 patients and the number of patients to be included was reduced from 900 to 
about 60. No meaningful information as regards efficacy and safety can be extracted.  
Clinical Safety 
Protocol 071 randomized 866 patients: 438 patients received the aprepitant regimen and 428 
patients  received  the  standard  regimen.  Of  the  438  patients  who  received  the  aprepitant 
regimen, 430 patients completed Cycle 1 and 334 Cycle 4 of chemotherapy. Only safety data 
from the women included in study 071, were presented. 
Adverse events (AE) 
As  expected  in  a  population  receiving  chemotherapy,  most  patients  experienced  a  clinical 
adverse  experience  during  the  study.  In  Cycle  1  (Table  6),  73.1%  of  patients  receiving  the 
aprepitant  regimen  and  74.8%  of  patients  in  the  standard  regimen  experienced  a  clinical 
adverse experience. The treatment groups were similar with respect to the incidence of drug-
related adverse experiences (21.5% versus 19.6%), serious adverse experiences (3.4% versus 
4.2%),  and  adverse  experiences  that  led  to  drug  discontinuation  (1.6% versus  1.2%)  in  the 
aprepitant regimen versus the standard regimen, respectively.

Among  the  most  commonly  reported  drug-related  events  (incidence  >2%  in  one  or  more 
treatment groups), only fatigue was reported more frequently in the aprepitant regimen than in 
the standard regimen (2.5% and 1.6%, respectively). Those events reported more frequently in 
the standard regimen included constipation (7.7% and 5.7%) and headache (7.2% and 6.4%).  
There  was  no  increase  in  infectious  events  in  the  aprepitant  arm  (9.4%  vs.  11.7%).  With 
respect to febrile neutropenia, the incidence was identical cycle 1 (2.1%), but slightly higher 
cycles 2 to 4 (2.9% vs. 2.2%).  
During  the  multiple  cycles  of  chemotherapy  (Cycles  2  to  4),  the  incidence  and  pattern  of 
drug-related clinical adverse experiences were essentially similar to those seen in Cycle 1. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No patients in either treatment group died during Cycle 1. One patient receiving the aprepitant 
regimen died during Cycle 3. This patient died as a result of a serious infection that was not 
considered by the investigator to be drug related.  
In  Cycle  1,  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  serious  adverse  experiences  was  reported  for  the 
patients  receiving  the  standard  regimen  (4.2%)  compared  with  patients  receiving  the 
aprepitant  regimen  (3.4%).  Two  patients  in  the  aprepitant  regimen  had  serious  adverse 
experiences  that  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug  related  (febrile  neutropenia 
and enterocolitis). 
Twelve patients discontinued study therapy due to a clinical adverse experience during Cycle 
1; 7 patients (1.6%) and 5 patients (1.2%) in the aprepitant regimen and the standard regimen, 
respectively.  Adverse experiences that led to discontinuation of the aprepitant regimen were 
enterocolitis,  nausea,  weight  decreased,  dehydration,  headache,  migraine,  pruritus,  rash,  and 
flushing.  Adverse  experiences  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  the  standard  regimen  were 
diarrhoea, haematochezia, dehydration, headache, and deep vein thrombosis.   
Laboratory findings 
During Cycle 1, 12 patients (aprepitant regimen: 4 patients, standard regimen: 8 patients) had 
a laboratory adverse experience that was deemed by the investigator to be drug related.  There 
were  no  laboratory  adverse  experiences  that  were  serious  during  Cycle  1.  No  patients  were 
withdrawn from the study (Cycles 1 to 4) due to a laboratory adverse experience. 
Laboratory  adverse  experiences  during  the  multiple  cycles  were  similar  to  those  in  Cycle 1 
and between treatment groups.   
The  adverse  events  profile  of  the  product  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  cytotoxic  treatment. 
The  adverse  events  reported  were  balanced  between  treatment  arms. No  new  or  unexpected 
adverse  events  were  reported.  The  safety  profile  observed  in  trial  071  is  comparable  with 
those seen in the original application (studies 052 and 054). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall Discussion and Benefit – Risk assessment 
Although two studies were submitted, only protocol 071 was used in the assessment for this 
extension of indication. Protocol 071 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-
group trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of an aprepitant-containing regimen for the 
prevention  of  CINV  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  breast  cancer  requiring  treatment  with 
non-cisplatin  moderately 
included 
cyclophosphamide  750  to  1500  mg/m2,  or  cyclophosphamide  500  to  1500  mg/m2  and 
doxorubicin  (≤60  mg/m2)  or  epirubicin  (≤100  mg/m2).  Due  to  methodological  difficulties 
study 044 was not assessable as pivotal nor as supportive study. Also the safety data from this 
study (044) could not be used in the safety assessment of the product. Therefore only study 
071 was adequate for assessment of the benefit/risk of aprepitant in the applied indication. 
chemotherapy

that 
The possible effect of aprepitant on cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics was discussed in the 
original application of Emend. Conclusion at that time was that the data suggest that CYP3A4 
does  not  play  a  major  role  in  cyclophosphamide  metabolism,  and  that  therefore  no  relevant 
effect  of  aprepitant  on  clinical  efficacy  of  cyclophosphamide  containing  regimens  is  to  be 
expected.  However,  additional  data  obtained  from  a  recent  combination  study  performed  in 
the  Netherlands  (de  Jong  et  al,  20041)  in  patients  receiving  high-dose  cyclophosphamide, 
thiotepa  and  carboplatin  indicated  that  aprepitant  decreased  the  rate  of  autoinduction  of 
cyclophosphamide  activation  to  4-OH  cyclophosphamide  by  approximately  25%.  Although 
the  active  metabolite  of  cyclophosphamide,  4-hydroxycyclophosphamide  AUC  only 
decreased 5% in the presence of aprepitant, the exposure appears to be obtained via lower but 
sustained  plasma  concentrations  of  4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. 
is  should  be 
acknowledged  that  the  study  group  in  the  de  Jong  publication  is  rather  small  and  that  the 
effect  of  aprepitant  on  the  exposure  to  4-HC  was  mild.  However,  concerns  on  the  effect  of 
aprepitant  on  the  efficacy  of  cyclophosphamide  treatment  of  breast  cancer  remain  due  to 
uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  estimated  effect  on  4-HC  and  the  impact  on  curative 
character of this treatment remain. Comparative efficacy data, of the standard and aprepitant 
regimen, in terms of CR and PR were not evaluated in study 071 butcomparative safety data, 
e.g. with respect to grade and duration of neutropenia did not indicate reduced cytotoxicity of 
cyclophosphamide in the aprepitant group. 
It 
Data on in vitro inhibition of CYP2B6 in the de Jong publication and in the MAH in house 
studies differ with IC50 1.3 µg/ml (2.5µm) reported by de Jong and IC50 45 µM reported by 
the  MAH.  IC50  values  are  difficult  to  compare  between  studies,  and  Ki  values  were  not 
reported. With a Cmax in the range of 3 µM the MAH data suggest a fairly low potential for in 
vivo  inhibition  of  CYP2B6.  as  the  actual  in  vitro  studies  have  not  been  fully  assessed,  an 
effect on CYP2B6 in vivo cannot be excluded. In order to facilitate estimation of the possible 
effect  of  aprepitant  on  CYP2B6,  follow-up  data  (notably  to  determine  the  Ki  value)  are 
needed. 
Though  the  patient  population  in  study  071  was  almost  exclusively  female  it  has  been 
questioned whether the efficacy of aprepitant in the prevention of emesis can be extrapolated 
to  men  across  the  spectrum  of  emetogenic  chemotherapy  regimens.  For  highly  emetogenic 
courses there is no gender effect. This conclusion was already reached by the CHMP during 
the  assessment  of  the  original  application.  The  problem  at  hand  is  the  extrapolation  of  the

conclusions  from  these  highly  emetogenic  therapies  to  moderately  emetogenic  treatments. 
Two  new  elements  related  to  this  issue  are  included  in  the  dossier.  First,  is  shown  that  the 
results  obtained  in  women  treated  with  highly  emetogenic  treatments  (Hesketh  5)  are  not 
different  from  those  treated  with  moderately  emetogenic  therapies.  Second,  in  general 
literature, a gender difference is not an issue in the discussions about the effects of the various 
anti-emetic treatment modalities. Although the female gender is accounted as a risk factor for 
development  of  vomiting  and  nausea,  the  female  gender  is  never  related  to  deviant  relative 
efficacy  of  any  anti-emetogenic  treatment  modality.  Based  on  this  newly  submitted 
information, it seems there is no indication that the product will not have an effect in men. 
Study 071 only addresses efficacy and safety of Emend in moderately emetogenic schedules. 
Due to the small number of patients administered Hesketh level 5 chemotherapy regimens and 
the absence of glucocorticoid therapy after day 1, no conclusions can be drawn in relation to 
this  subgroup  of  patients.  As  no  new  data  concerning  highly  emetogenic  schedules  are 
submitted, the indication should specify that Emend is to be used for the prevention of nausea 
and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. 
As  regards  moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapies,  however,  a  significant  benefit  was 
demonstrated  in  terms  of  overall  response  rate.  The  results  indicate  that  in  study  071  the 
‘aprepitant  regimen’  was  more  effective  than  the  standard  regimen  with  respect  to  the 
complete response endpoint, with statistical superiority for the primary end point (p=0.015). 
In the acute phase  the results were  also statistically superior (p=0.034) while in the delayed 
phase  no  statistical  significance  was  reached  (p=0.064).  Also  considering  that  the  standard 
therapy  (not  steroid-containing)  was  suboptimal  to  the  usual  used  regimes  the  data  indicate 
that the efficacy of aprepitant as single agent in the delayed phase is questionable.  
Although  the  effect  on  nausea  appears  to  be  less  than  that  on  vomiting  (i.e.  no  superiority 
could be demonstrated), there are insufficient reasons to distinguish in the indication between 
the two phenomena. However the data are presented in section 5.1 of the SPC. 
Results  of  the  standard  therapy  were  within  the  expected  range  as  were  the  results  of 
aprepitant  in  the  overall  and  acute  phase.  Results  in  the  delayed  phase  seemed  inferior  as 
(indirectly) compared to the results reported in the high-emetogenic studies (in these studies 
dexamethasone  was  added  to  the  regimen  during  day  2-5),  but  this  may  also  indicate  that 
platina  induced  delayed  emesis  is  different  from  that  seen  with  moderately  emetogenic 
schedules. 
No  superiority  in  use  of  rescue  therapy,  no  nausea  or  significant  nausea  could  be 
demonstrated.  Impact-on-daily  life  data  indicated  a  superiority  of  aprepitant  regimen.  The 
nausea data are more or less in line with the results reported in the previous application. The 
impact-on-daily-life  data  also  show  a  minor  effect  on  the  nausea  component.  However  the 
overall  endpoints  (primary  and  secondary)  show  statistical  significant  superiority  for 
aprepitant. These contrasting results are reflected in the SPC in section 5.1. 
Efficacy  results  in  multiple  cycles  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  fact  that 
patients  may  have  chosen  whether  or  not  to  continue  into  the  next  cycle  based  on  their 
response in the previous cycle leading to a more favorable response rate in later cycles. Re-
randomization prior to, e.g. cycle two would have been appropriate. Although numerical the 
found efficacy (and superiority) seemed to be retained, the data obtained in cycle 2-4 do not 
allow any conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the two regimens. Results obtained in 
the cycles 2-4 are not mentioned in the SPC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  adverse  events  profile  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  cytotoxic  treatment.  No  new  or 
unexpected  adverse  events  were  reported.  The  safety  profile  observed  in  trial  071  is 
comparable with those seen in the original application. 
Based on the CHMP review of the above data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered 
that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  extension  of 
indication for EMEND: 
“Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic 
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. 
Prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy. 
EMEND is given as part of combination therapy.”

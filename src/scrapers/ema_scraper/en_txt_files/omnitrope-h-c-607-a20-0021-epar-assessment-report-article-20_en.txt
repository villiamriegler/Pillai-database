1.  Background information on the procedure 
On 9 December 2010 the French Medicines Agency (AFSSAPS) informed the European Commission and 
the European Medicines Agency of some early-break, high-level results of the SAGHE study (Santé 
Adulte GH Enfant), which is aimed at assessing the long-term mortality and morbidity of recombinant 
growth hormone in children treated during childhood and who were exposed to recombinant growth 
hormone between 1985 and 1996.  
The long-term surveillance SAGHE study is based on a mandatory register of all patients treated with 
recombinant growth hormone in childhood in France since its approval in the mid 1980s to 1996. 
Follow-up data were collected until 1996, when the national compulsory France-Hypophyse register 
was closed. Additional follow-up data on growth hormone treatments were collected from clinical 
centres in 2008-2010. 
Early results of the mortality analysis had become available for patients treated for idiopathic growth 
hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature and short stature in children born short for gestational 
age.  
These results questioned the long-term safety of growth hormone treatments, particularly when high 
doses are used. In light of these safety data, there was a need to review all safety data on somatropin 
(in particular to further evaluate the potential increased risk of mortality due to diseases of the 
circulatory system, bone tumours and subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage in children) and its 
impact on the benefit/risk balance for the various approved indications.  
Therefore, on 10 December 2010, the European Commission (EC) initiated a procedure under Article 
20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for somatropin-containing medicinal products authorised in the 
centralised procedure and referred the matter to the CHMP. The EC requested the CHMP to assess all 
the available data and its impact on the risk benefit balance for somatropin-containing medicinal 
products and to give its opinion on measures necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of these 
medicinal products and whether the marketing authorisations for these products should be maintained, 
varied, suspended or revoked. 
The scope of the review was to assess the long-term safety of growth hormone treatments in light of 
the emerging safety data from the SAGHE study in particular with regards the potential increased risk 
of mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system, bone tumours and subarachnoid or intracerebral 
haemorrhage in children and when high doses are used.   
After reviewing all the available data submitted to address the concerns discussed, the CHMP adopted 
an opinion on 15 December 2011.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Somatropin is a recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) acting on the metabolism of lipids, 
carbohydrates and proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin 
stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate. In adults, somatropin maintains a normal body 
composition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by 
mobilisation of body fat.  
Currently there are nine approved somatropin-medicinal products in the Union: Genotropin, 
Humatrope, Maxomat, Norditropin, Saizen, Zomacton approved via Mutual Recognition procedure 
(MRP) or Nationally (NAP) and Omnitrope, NutropinAq and Valtropin approved centrally (CAP).  
Somatropin (rhGH) products have been available in Europe since the late 1980’s for the treatment of 
several conditions associated with growth hormone deficiency and/or short stature.  
In the Union, somatropin is approved to be used in children for growth hormone deficiency (including 
idiopathic growth hormone deficiency), growth failure in patients with Turner syndrome, chronic renal 
insufficiency or short stature homebox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome and 
in patients born small for gestational age (SGA). An overview of the therapeutic indications and 
posology approved for all available products in children in the Union is presented in the following table:

The indications for growth hormone therapy have gradually been extended since the 1980’s from 
severe growth hormone deficiency to a number of conditions in which primarily childhood short stature 
is not primarily due to a deficiency of endogenous growth hormone secretion. The long term efficacy of 
somatropin in children with severe growth hormone deficiency is unquestionable.  
The safety of growth hormone therapy has been mainly based on large samples of patients followed in 
post-marketing databases including registries during or not long after treatment only. Therefore, 
limited information on long-term safety of somatropin treatment is currently available.  
Somatropin-treatment has been associated with tumour-promoting potential and this is currently 
reflected in the product information of all somatropin-containing medicinal products. Firstly due to the 
biological plausibility based on the established tumorigenic potential of insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1), which is the key mediator of GH activity and secreted in response to GH receptor activation. 
Secondly, due to several published studies that reported a higher risk of tumour and/or tumour related 
mortality for patients treated with growth hormone (Swerdlow et al. 20021, Sklar et al. 20022 and by 
Ergun-Longmire et al. 20063).  
In fact this safety issue of tumour-promoting potential was subject to a review performed by the 
Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) which concluded, in early 2009 that changes to the labelling were strongly recommended. It 
was also acknowledged that the risk assessment performed was based in a small number of cases and 
the significance of these results would still remain uncertain until further data was available.  
A large epidemiological study based on data from the Association France-Hypophyse registry was 
ongoing since 2007 – the French Santé Adulte GH Enfant (SAGHE) study. This long-term surveillance 
study collected data from all patients that were treated with rhGH in the period from 1985 to 1996 and 
who were older than 18 years of age at the time of data collection in 2007. The primary objective of 
the study was to evaluate the overall and cancer-related mortality and morbidity risks in comparison 
with risks in the general population.  
On 9 December 2010, the French National Competent Authority (AFSSAPS) informed the European 
Commission, the European Medicines Agency and all Member States of unpublished results of the 
SAGHE study that showed an all-cause mortality significantly higher in children treated with rhGH 
(Standardised Mortality Ratio - SMR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08;1.64). These results suggested an increased 
mortality with doses higher than 0.050 mg/Kg/day and due to diseases of the circulatory system 
(subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage) and bone tumours.  
During their plenary meetings in December 2010, the results of the SAGHE study were presented by 
the principal investigator to the PhVWP and to the CHMP.

On 16 December 2010 the CHMP adopted a list of questions to be addressed by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holders (MAHs) of all somatropin-containing medicinal products and a list of questions to 
be addressed by the investigators of the French SAGHE study.  
All safety available data submitted to this review was considered by the CHMP and is hereafter 
discussed.  
2.2.  Clinical safety 
Safety data were submitted by the MAHs, including data from clinical trials (past and ongoing), 
registries, cohorts and safety databases (pharmacovigilance) on risk of neoplasms and cardiovascular 
risks. Data available in the literature on these issues were also considered. In addition the EMA 
provided data from the European Pharmacovigilance database (Eudravigilance) and conducted a drug 
utilisation study of somatropin-containing products in the United Kingdom by using the THIN database.   
2.2.1.  French Santé Adulte GH Enfant (SAGHE) study 
Design and objectives 
This is a long-term surveillance study which collected data from a mandatory register in France of all 
patients that were treated with rhGH during childhood between the period of 1985 to 1996 and who 
were older than 18 years of age at the time of data collection in 2007. Follow-up data were collected 
from paediatric endocrinologists until 1996 and additional follow-up data were collected from clinical 
centres in 2008-2010. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the overall and cancer-related mortality and morbidity risks in 
comparison with the risks in the general population. Secondary objectives were to assess the non-
cancer mortality and morbidity risks on an exploratory basis. 
Study population 
All 10,330 patients that were treated with rhGH and who were older than 18 years by the end of 2007 
were assigned to three risk categories for long-term mortality based on the clinical condition. 
The low risk population defined as treatment for idiopathic growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short 
stature, short stature in children born short for gestational age, or isolated growth hormone deficiency 
was included in the mortality analysis (n=6,892 patients corresponding to 116,403 person-years of 
observation).  
All other categories of growth hormone treated children were excluded from this analysis, including 
those with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, growth hormone deficiency secondary to a tumour 
and paediatric syndromes such as Turner syndrome.  
Results  
The mean follow-up time from treatment initiation to death, loss to follow-up or census was 16.9 
years. The principal outcomes measured were standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and hazard ratios 
(HR, using the category with the lowest exposure level as the reference).  
All-cause mortality was higher in children treated with growth hormone (SMR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08–1.64) 
in comparison with general population (Table 2). Mortality was significantly higher for the children who

were shortest at the start of treatment and those who received the highest doses of growth hormone. 
An increased risk was also associated with the short duration of treatment.

When adjusted for height at the start of treatment, the use of doses higher than 0.050 mg/kg/day was 
significantly associated with mortality (adjusted SMR 2.94, 95%CI 1.22–7.07, adjusted HR 2.79, 
95%CI 1.14–6.82). 
Analyses by specific cause  of mortality showed an increase due to diseases of the circulatory system 
(SMR 3.07, 95%CI 1.40–5.83), bone tumours (SMR 5.00, 95%CI 1.01–14.63) and subarachnoid or

Discussion and conclusion 
Overall, results of the French SAGHE study suggest a small increased mortality risk with an excess of 
23 deaths over the 70 expected.  
The suggested increased risk with the dose is only statistically significant in the group treated with 
mean doses above 0.050 mg/kg/day (n=281, table 2). In this group, 225 (80%) out of the 281 
patients were part of a company-sponsored study conducted in children born short for gestational age 
(SGA). A sensitive analysis of survival excluding these SGA patients showed a dose effect (HR of 5.05 
[1.16-22.09]) with a threshold of 0.040 mg/kg/day (dose range 0-0.020 mg/kg/day as reference). 
Therefore, the dose effect of GH treatment in this patient group may not only be due to patients who 
were born SGA. Nevertheless, this is a very small population for a clear association with the dose to be 
made.  
In addition, the analysis of mortality by cumulative dose does not show a dose effect. 
The statistical significant increased risk seen only for patients treated for less than 2 years could not be 
explained.  
Of the 93 all-cause mortality cases, 21 deaths classified as resulting from “ill-defined conditions” are 
noted to be of unknown cause. Data from the patient group that died due to diseases of the circulatory 
system (n=9) showed that all but one had been treated for a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. 
Age at death was between 13 and 33 years old and all deaths except one occurred between 13 and 
17.8 years old after treatment initiation. No information on the presence of cardiovascular risk factors 
was available for 3 patients. This information is very limited not allowing a conclusion. 
No data on the occurrence of non-fatal neoplasms in patients of the SAGHE study is, at the moment, 
available. The morbidity study planned in the scope of the French SAGHE study is currently on-going.

Finally, one of the main limitations of this study is the general population that was used as reference 
group to calculate the SMR. This leads to unmeasurable confounding that precludes the results of this 
study to be regarded as robust evidence. Moreover the characteristics of the treated patients may per 
se be associated with increased mortality even if in a low risk group (isolated GHD, ISS and SGA).  
Based on all the above, the results currently available from this large and long-term study cannot be 
regarded as robust. Nevertheless, these results are regarded as potential safety signal to be further 
considered upon availability of additional long-term safety data. 
2.2.2.  European Santé Adulte GH Enfant (SAGHE) study 
The French SAGHE study is part of a European consortium called “SAGHE” for safety and 
appropriateness of growth hormone treatment in Europe, involving other 7 countries (Belgium, United 
Kingdom, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Sweden) which started on the 1st June 2009. 
This study is part of the FP7 Health work programme and approximatelly the sample size is of 30,000 
patients. The study results are expected to be available in 2013. 
The investigators of the SAGHE in each involved country were invited to share preliminary available 
data on the association between GH treatment in childhood and mortality (overall and cancer-related) 
and cancer incidence (overall and cancer specific) from their cohorts. However, the process of 
collecting data from national registries on GH-treated children is still on going and no data was 
available for this review.  
2.2.3.  Data from clinical studies, registries, cohorts and safety databases  
Exposure data by indication and dose (mg/Kg/day) was submitted for almost all somatropin medicinal 
products based on their ongoing registries.  Stratification by country was also submitted when 
available. Overall the higher exposure of use of somatropin in Europe is shown in idiopathic growth 
hormone deficiencies and in general used within the range of recommended doses. All products have a 
registry in place and only one of the nine somatropin product has not been marketed. 
Data from clinical trials (past and ongoing), registries, and cohorts were submitted by the MAHs 
addressing the two main safety concerns of neoplasms and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risks. 
Overall, no conclusion can be drawn on the risks observed from these data. The clinical studies have 
short duration, the follow-up is predominately performed during treatment or during 3- 4 years after 
treatment and the number of patients is very limited for a powerful statistical analysis to be 
performed.  
Cumulative reviews from post-marketing data were also performed and presented by the MAHs. 
Overall, no safety concern regarding fatal cardiovascular events and fatal de novo malignancies or 
recurrence of malignancies in rhGH treated patients with a prior history of cancer rise from these data.  
2.2.4.  Literature review data  
Baseline Mortality and Morbidity 
In the vast majority of studies available on patients with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD), all-cause 
mortality is increased in patients with hypopituitarism when compared to age- and sex-matched 
Assessment report for Omnitrope

controls4 (SMR = 1.81 p<0.001, with an average follow up duration of 15.2 years). Mortality due to 
vascular or cardiovascular events was particularly of concern in these patients5.  
GH deficiency has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors: abnormal body composition, excess 
body fat, elevated waist-to-hip ratio and BMI, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, elevated inflammatory 
markers and hypertension, premature atherosclerosis in several studies. (6, 7, 8, 9, 5, 10). 
In patients born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) and patients with Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS), a 
meta-analysis by Paajanen and col. ( 11) reported that “All cause mortality” as well as “Cardiovascular 
mortality” is inversely proportional to height, with the shortest individuals having the highest risk. 
Several other studies also reported that children with ISS or SGA are more prone to develop metabolic 
and cardiovascular risk factors (12, 13, 14, 15). 
Mortality/morbidity in GH-treated patients  
It has been shown that all-cause mortality rate is not different from the normal population rate (16).  
Growth hormone treatment in paediatric and adult GHD-patients has not demonstrated any deleterious 
effect on various concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. It is noted that beneficial effects of GH 
treatment on several cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids and blood pressure, and consequently a 
potential reduction in cardiovascular and vascular morbidities have been reported. There are currently 
no data to support a negative impact of GH treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk. Nevertheless, 
this potential risk should be considered during the treatment with somatropin.  
GH therapy neither increases the recurrence of childhood neoplasms nor the overall incidence of de 
novo cases.  The recurrence of tumours or the occurrence of second neoplasms are mainly observed in 
high risk patients who have been previously treated by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy and 
received in addition GH treatment for short stature due to their pathology. This higher risk of a 2nd 
neoplasm reported in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin has been described by Sklar

et al 2 (2002) and Ergun-Longmire3(2006) and is reflected in the product information of some 
somatropin products. However, the majority of data has been obtained in children and in adults under 
treatment or shortly after GH treatment discontinuation. Hence there is a significant lack of long term 
safety data on adults treated with GH during childhood. The cohort study of Swerdlow et al 1in the UK 
was unique in providing data on mortality with a mean follow-up of 21 years, but in a limited number 
of patients. 
2.2.5.  Data provided by the EMA  
The Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management section of the EMA performed an analysis of the case 
reports received up to 7th December 2010 with recombinant growth hormone and included in the 
Eudravigilance database. Overall a total of 5044 case reports (EEA case reports=1998; reports in 
patients <18 years=2773) of which 446 with fatal outcome were identified. Information regarding 
dose-effect and fatal outcome was too limited and too heterogeneous to be exploitable. Therefore, no 
conclusion can be drawn on a relationship between deaths and the GH doses used. 
The use of somatropin in clinical practice in the UK was characterised in a drug utilisation analysis of 
the Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. This study provided an overview of the pattern of 
utilisation of somatropin-containing products in the UK with regards to age, sex and indications. Data 
on doses are not interpretable due to the incomplete information regarding weight.  
3.  Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
Safety 
Somatropin medicinal products in the Union are approved to be used in children for growth hormone 
deficiency (including idiopathic growth hormone deficiency), growth failure in patients with Turner 
syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency or short stature homebox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, 
Prader-Willi syndrome and in patients born small for gestational age (SGA). Some indications are not 
approved for all somatropin containing medicines. 
The long term efficacy of somatropin in children with severe growth hormone deficiency is 
unquestionable.  
Long term safety data on adults treated with growth hormone during childhood is based on large 
samples of patients followed in post-marketing databases during or not long after treatment. 
Therefore, long term safety data of somatropin treatment is limited. 
Somatropin-treatment has been associated with potential tumour-promoting not only due to the 
biological plausibility based on the established tumorigenic potential of insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) but also due to several published studies that reported a higher risk of tumour and/or tumour 
related mortality for patients treated with growth hormone (Swerdlow et al. 20021, Sklar et al. 20022 
and by Ergun-Longmire et al. 20063). This potential risk associated with the growth hormone 
treatment is reflected in the product information for all somatropin-containing products.  
Results of the French SAGHE study, a long-term surveillance study in a high number of patients and 
with a mean follow up of 17 years suggested an overall increase of mortality in patients treated  with 
somatropin for isolated growth hormone deficiency (GDH), idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short for 
gestational age (SGA) compared to the general population. Increased mortality was apparent with 
when higher doses were used and due to subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage and bone 
tumours.  
Assessment report for Omnitrope  
EMA/164541/2012  
Page 11/14 
 
 
 
 
 
However, this study presents significant methodological limitations that preclude these results to be 
regarded as robust. Namely, the general population used as reference group for the calculation of the 
standard mortality ratios leading to unmeasurable confounding. Also, the characteristics of the treated 
patients that per se may be associated with increased mortality, even if in a low risk group (i.e. treated 
for isolated GHD, ISS and SGA).  
Overall mortality risk was small, with an excess of 23 deaths over the 70 expected. Of the 93 all-cause 
mortality cases, 21 classified as resulting from “ill-defined conditions” are of unknown cause. The 
suggested increased risk with the higher doses is only statistically significant in the group treated with 
mean doses above 50 µg/kg/day (n=281). It is noted that in this group, 225 (80%) patients were part 
of a company-sponsored study conducted in children born short for gestational age (SGA) and overall 
this is considered a very small subpopulation for a clear association of the suggested risk with the 
dose. In addition the risk increased with short duration of treatment, nevertheless a sub-analysis by 
cumulative doses did not confirm this finding. Finally, data from the patient group that died due to 
diseases of the circulatory system showed that all but one had been treated for a diagnosis of growth 
hormone deficiency. No information on the presence of cardiovascular risk factors was available for 3 
out of 9 patients. This information is very limited not allowing a conclusion with regards the 
cardiovascular risks. 
No data on the occurrence of non-fatal neoplasms in patients of the SAGHE study is, at the moment, 
available and the morbidity results are still is on-going. 
The CHMP reviewed all data available from clinical trials (past and ongoing), registries, cohorts and 
safety databases (pharmacovigilance) on risk of neoplasms and cardiovascular risk provided by the 
MAHs. Overall, no conclusion can be drawn on the risks observed from these data. The short duration 
of the studies and the follow-up which is predominately performed during treatment or for 3- 4 years 
after treatment and the number of patients is very limited for a powerful statistical analysis to be 
performed.  
Data available from the literature was also reviewed. No new or additional safety concern rise from 
new published data. 
Overall, in view of the limitations of the French SAGHE study the findings of an apparent increased risk 
of mortality in children treated with somatropin (increased risk with higher doses and relating to 
subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage and bone tumours) cannot be regarded as robust data.  
However, the results of the French SAGHE study are regarded as potential safety signal to be further 
considered in light of long term safety data that will become available in 2 years time, namely the 
results of the European SAGHE consortium study. In the meantime and based on all above discussed, 
the Committee considered justified to harmonise already existing contraindications for all somatropin 
containing medicinal products with regards the potential for tumour-promoting associated with 
treatment. A specific wording to be include in section 4.3 of the SmPCs and reflected in the package 
leaflet of all somatropin-containing medicinal products was agreed (see section 2.5).  
This potential risk should also be reflected in the Risk Management Plan for all somatropin products as 
well as the potential risk to subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage.  
Finally, to address the potential signal of an increased risk with increased dose as suggested by the 
results of the French SAGHE study, it was agreed to emphasize in the product information of all 
somatropin-containing medicinal products that the maximum recommended daily dose should not be 
exceeded.

Benefit/risk balance 
The findings of this review do not change the overall balance of risks and benefits of Omnitrope in its 
authorised indications, which remain favourable. 
3.1.  Risk management plan 
In view of the above discussed and considering that results of the French SAGHE study are regarded as 
potential safety signal, the CHMP concluded that the Risk Management Plans of all somatropin 
containing medicinal products should be submitted/updated to reflect the following potential risks: 
•  New neoplasm 
•  Second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors 
• 
Intracranial aneurysm and Intracranial haemorrhage 
3.2.  Product information 
In light of the above concluded the CHMP agreed with the following amendments to the product 
information of all somatropin-containing medicinal products:

4.  Overall conclusion 
The  CHMP  recommended  the  amendment  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  Omnitrope 
for  which  the  revised  summary  of  product  characteristics,  annex  II  and  package  leaflet  are  set  out 
respectively in annexes I, II and IIIB of the opinion. 
The  scientific  conclusions  and  the  grounds  for  the  amendment  of  the  SmPC,  Annex  II,  and  package 
leaflet are set out in Annex IV of the opinion. 
5.  Conclusion and grounds for the recommendation 
Whereas 
• 
• 
The Committee considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, for 
Omnitrope initiated by the European Commission. 
The Committee considered the results of the French SAGHE study and all available data submitted 
from  clinical  trials,  registries,  cohorts  and  safety  databases  in  relation  to  the  cardiovascular  risk 
and risk of neoplasm associated with somatropin-treatment. 
The  Committee  agreed  that  the  French  SAGHE  study  has  significant  methodological  limitations 
(e.g.  general  population  used  as  reference  for  the  calculation  of  mortality).  In  view  of  these 
limitations,  the  Committee  concluded  that  the  study  findings  of  an  apparent  increased  risk  of 
mortality  in  children  treated  with  somatropin  (increased  risk  with  higher  doses  and  relating  to 
subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage and bone tumours) cannot be regarded as robust. 
•  Other  data  reviewed  did  not  corroborate  the  results  of  the  SAGHE  study,  or  provided  additional 
safety concerns. 
• 
The Committee agreed however, that the results of the French SAGHE study are regarded as 
potential safety signal. Considering previously published data and information already included in 
the Product Information for some somatropins, the Committee considered that it is justified to 
harmonise existing contraindications for all somatropin containing medicines when there is any 
evidence of activity of a tumour. This also needs to be reflected in the Risk Management Plans as 
well as the potential risk linked to subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage. Furthermore, the 
Committee agreed to emphasise in the Product Information (section 4.4) the need for the 
maximum recommended dose not to be exceeded.  
In view of the above, the CHMP has recommended the variation to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisations for Omnitrope (see Annex A), for which the relevant sections of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet are set out in Annex I and III B and subject to the conditions set 
out in Annex II of the Opinion.

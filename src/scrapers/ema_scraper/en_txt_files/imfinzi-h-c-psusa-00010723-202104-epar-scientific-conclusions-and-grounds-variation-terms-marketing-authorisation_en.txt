Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for durvalumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on pancreatitis, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between durvalumab 
and pancreatitis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that  the product information of 
products containing durvalumab should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for durvalumab the CHMP  is of the  opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the  medicinal product(s) containing  durvalumab is unchanged subject to  the proposed 
changes to  the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

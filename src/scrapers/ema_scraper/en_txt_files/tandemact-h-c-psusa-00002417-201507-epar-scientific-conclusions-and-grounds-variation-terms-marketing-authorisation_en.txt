Active substance(s): glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / 
pioglitazone, pioglitazone

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for glimepiride / pioglitazone 
hydrochloride, metformin / pioglitazone, pioglitazone, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as 
follows:  
The product information (Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC) provides already information on clinical trial 
results in which showed an increased fracture risk in women only. However epidemiological data from 
the post-marketing experience shows an increased risk of fractures in both men and women and caution 
is advised in patients with long term treatment. Therefore it is recommended that the product 
information for pioglitazone-containing products is updated to accurately reflect the post-marketing 
experience in the relevant sections of the SmPC and the package leaflet.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / 
pioglitazone, pioglitazone the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal 
product(s) containing glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / pioglitazone, pioglitazone 
is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

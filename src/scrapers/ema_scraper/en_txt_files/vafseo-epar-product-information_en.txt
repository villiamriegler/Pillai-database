CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vafseo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) in adults on chronic maintenance dialysis. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vadadustat should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of anaemia. All other 
causes of anaemia should be evaluated prior to initiating therapy with Vafseo, and when deciding to 
increase the dose. 
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a 
physician’s evaluation of the individual patient’s clinical course and condition is necessary. In addition 
to the presence of symptoms of anaemia, criteria such as rate of fall of haemoglobin (Hb) 
concentration, prior response to iron therapy, and the risk of needing of red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusion could be considered in the evaluation of the individual patient’s clinical course and 
condition. 
Posology 
Evaluation before administration 
Evaluation of iron stores and nutritional factors 
Iron status should be evaluated in all patients before and during treatment. Supplemental iron therapy 
should be administered when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin 
saturation is less than 20%.  
Dose initiation 
The recommended starting dose is 300 mg once daily. Do not increase the dose more frequently than 
once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. 
Patients converting from an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) 
When converting from an ESA to Vafseo, the recommended starting dose is 300 mg once daily. 
Those patients converting from a high baseline dose of ESA may experience an initial decline in Hb 
levels before gradually returning to baseline Hb levels by Weeks 16 to 20 (see section 5.1 for course 
Hb during treatment in individual studies). Taking into account the gradual rise in Hb with Vafseo, 
rescue therapy in the form of RBC transfusion or ESA treatment may be considered during the 
transition phase if Hb values fall below 9.0 g/dL or response is considered not acceptable (see section 
4.4). Patients receiving RBC transfusions are recommended to continue Vafseo treatment during the 
transfusion period. Vafseo should be paused for those patients receiving temporary ESA rescue 
treatment and may be resumed when Hb levels are ≥10 g/dL. Depending on the ESA employed, the 
pause in Vafseo treatment should be extended to:  
•  2 days after last dose of epoetin  
•  7 days after last dose of darbepoetin alfa  
•  14 days after last dose of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. 
Following ESA rescue, Vafseo should be resumed at the prior dose or one dose higher, with 
subsequent titration according to the dose titration guidelines given below in this section. 
Dose titration 
When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor Hb levels every two weeks until stable, then monitor at 
least monthly. Dose adjustment should be done in increments of 150 mg within the range of 150 mg to 
a maximum recommended daily dose of 600 mg to achieve or maintain Hb levels within 10 to 
12 g/dL. Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can 
occur more frequently. 
Treatment should not be continued beyond 24 weeks of therapy if a clinically meaningful increase in 
Hb levels is not achieved. Alternative explanations for an inadequate response should be sought and 
treated before re-starting Vafseo (see Table 1).

* Dose reduction may not be required in case of a single Hb value. 
Monitoring 
When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor Hb levels every two weeks until stable, then monitor at 
least monthly.  
ALT, AST, and bilirubin must be evaluated prior to the initiation of Vafseo, monthly for three months 
after initiation and as clinically indicated thereafter (see section 4.4). 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, patients should take the dose as soon as they remember during the same day and 
then patients should take the next dose at the usual time the next day. Patients should not take a double 
dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Vafseo is not 
recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) as the safety 
and efficacy has not been evaluated in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Vafseo in the paediatric population have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The film-coated tablet is administered orally with or without food and should be swallowed whole 
without chewing.  
Vafseo can be taken at any time before, during, or after dialysis. 
Vafseo should be administered at least 1 hour before oral iron supplements, products whose primary 
component consists of iron or iron-containing phosphate binders. As vadadustat may form a chelate 
with multivalent cations, Vafseo should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after non-
iron-containing phosphate binders or other medicinal products whose primary component consists of 
multivalent cations such as calcium, magnesium or aluminium (see section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardiovascular and mortality risk 
In controlled clinical trials patients with dialysis-dependent (DD) CKD treated with Vafseo, 
experienced similar risks for death, myocardial infarction and stroke compared to darbepoetin alfa (see 
section 5.1). 
Patients with signs and symptoms of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions or stroke should be 
promptly evaluated and treated according to standard of care. The decision to interrupt or discontinue 
treatment should be based on a benefit-risk consideration for the individual patient. 
Thromboembolic events 
Thromboembolic events were reported as very common amongst the patients from two active-
controlled clinical trials in CKD (see section 4.8). Therefore, patients with pre-existing risk factors for 
thromboembolic event and prior history of thromboembolic events (e.g., deep venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, and cerebral vascular accident) should be monitored carefully. 
Patients with signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events should be promptly evaluated and treated 
according to standard of care. The decision to interrupt or discontinue treatment should be based on a 
benefit-risk consideration for the individual patient. 
Hepatic impairment  
Vafseo is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hepatotoxicity   
An increase in ALT, AST (frequency common) and/or bilirubin (frequency uncommon) attributed to 
Vafseo was reported (see section 4.8). ALT, AST, and bilirubin must be evaluated prior to the 
initiation of Vafseo, monthly for three months after initiation and as clinically indicated thereafter (see 
section 4.2).  
Vafseo must be discontinued if ALT or AST elevations > 3x ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin 
increase > 2x ULN, or if there is persistent ALT or AST > 3x ULN (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Worsening of hypertension 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of Vafseo in patients with CKD may be associated with worsening of hypertension 
(see section 4.8). Blood pressure should be monitored before initiation and regularly thereafter at a 
frequency determined by a patient’s individual situation and local clinical practice. Patients should be 
advised on the importance to comply with antihypertensive therapy and monitoring of blood pressure. 
Convulsions 
Convulsions were commonly reported in patients receiving vadadustat (see section 4.8). Vadadustat 
should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsions or fits, epilepsy or medical 
conditions associated with a predisposition to convulsion activity such as central nervous system 
(CNS) infections. The decision to interrupt or discontinue treatment should be based on a benefit-risk 
consideration for the individual patient. 
Initial decrease in Hb levels in patients converting from ESA 
Hb levels may initially decrease when converting patients from an ESA to Vafseo especially in 
patients who were on high baseline ESA doses. Generally, the higher the baseline ESA dose, the 
deeper the initial decrease in Hb levels will be before levels gradually return to baseline Hb by Weeks 
16 to 20 (see section 5.1 for course of Hb during treatment in individual studies). Rescue therapy such 
as RBC transfusion or ESA treatment may be considered during the transition phase if Hb values fall 
below 9.0 g/dL or if response is considered not acceptable. Patients receiving RBC transfusions are 
recommended to continue Vafseo treatment during the transfusion period. Vafseo should be paused 
temporarily during ESA rescue treatment and may be resumed when Hb levels are ≥10 g/dL (see 
section 4.2). 
Inadequate response to therapy 
Inadequate response to therapy with vadadustat should prompt a search for causative factors. A 
reticulocyte count should be considered as part of the evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are 
excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, an examination of the bone marrow should be 
considered. In the absence of an addressable cause for an inadequate response by 24 weeks of therapy, 
Vafseo should be discontinued. 
Misuse 
Misuse may lead to an excessive increase in red blood cell volume. This may be associated with life-
threatening complications. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially 'sodium-free'. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Vadadustat was metabolically stable in vitro and metabolism via cytochrome P450s (CYPs) was 
minimal. The metabolic pathways involved were oxidation and mainly glucuronidation. The major 
circulating metabolite vadadustat-O-glucuronide was catalyzed by multiple uridine 5`-diphospho-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs, UGT1A1, 1A7, 1A8 and 1A9). 
Vadadustat has potentially clinically relevant interactions with breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) substrates, OAT3 substrates, OAT1/3 inhibitors and CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic index. 
Vadadustat induced CYP2B6, inhibited CYP2C8 and caused down-regulation of CYP3A4 in in vitro 
experiments. However, these interactions have not been examined in vivo.

Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of vadadustat 
Iron supplements, phosphate binders, and other medicinal products whose primary component 
consists of multivalent cations. 
Co-administration with oral iron supplements (e.g., ferric citrate, ferrous sulphate, sodium ferrous 
citrate), products which contain iron, iron-containing phosphate binders (e.g., ferric citrate, sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide) and non-iron-containing phosphate binders (calcium acetate, sevelamer carbonate) 
decreases the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of vadadustat. 
The co-administration of oral iron-based medicinal products reduced the bioavailability of vadadustat 
up to 90% and 92% in terms of the AUC∞ and Cmax. 
The co-administration of non-iron-containing phosphate binders reduced the bioavailability of 
vadadustat up to 55% and 52% for AUC∞ and Cmax. 
Vafseo should be administered at least 1 hour before oral iron supplements, products whose primary 
component consists of iron or iron-containing phosphate binders. As vadadustat may form a chelate 
with multivalent cations, Vafseo should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after non-
iron-containing phosphate binders or other medicinal products whose primary component consists of 
multivalent cations such as calcium, magnesium or aluminium. 
Organic anion transporter (OAT) OAT1/OAT3 inhibitors 
Co-administration with probenecid, an OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor, increased vadadustat AUC values 
almost 2-fold. If co-administration with strong or moderate OAT1 or OAT3 inhibitors (e.g. 
benzylpenicillin, teriflunomide or p-aminohippuric acid) occurs, patients should be managed 
cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects of vadadustat. For potential adverse reactions and dose 
adjustment in case of rapid Hb rise please refer to sections 4.8 and 4.2. 
Effect of vadadustat on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
BCRP substrates and some statins 
Vadadustat may increase the AUC of BCRP substrates, and some statins when co-administered. Dose 
adjustment of co-prescribed BCRP substrates may be needed. The following have been studied (see 
Table 2).

In addition to sulfasalazine, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin, monitor for signs of excessive effects of co-
administered BCRP substrates such as fluvastatin, nelfinavir, pitavastatin, and topotecan, and for the 
need of their dose reduction. 
OAT3 substrates 
Vadadustat may increase the AUC of OAT3 substrates when co-administered. The AUC of 
furosemide (40 mg) increased 2-fold following multiple doses of Vafseo (600 mg once daily). Monitor 
for signs of excessive effects of the co-administered OAT3 substrates such as famotidine, furosemide, 
methotrexate, olmesartan, sitagliptin, and zidovudine. 
Dose adjustment of concomitantly administered OAT3 substrate may be needed. 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Co-administration of vadadustat (600 mg) with celecoxib (200 mg) increased celecoxib Cmax and AUC 
60% and 11%, respectively. Patients receiving warfarin or other narrow therapeutic CYP2C9 
substrates (e.g., phenytoin) must therefore be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects 
when treated with vadadustat. 
CYP2B6 substrates 
Vadadustat is an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6. Co-administration of vadadustat with sensitive 
substrates of CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz, bupropion) may alter their pharmacokinetics, and therefore 
caution should be exercised when vadadustat is co-administered with CYP2B6 substrates. 
CYP3A4 substrates 
Based on in vitro data, vadadustat may have a potential for CYP3A4 downregulation. Co-
administration of vadadustat with CYP3A4 substrates may alter their pharmacokinetics and therefore 
caution should be exercised when vadadustat is co-administered with CYP3A4 substrates. 
CYP2C8 substrates 
Based on in vitro data, vadadustat may inhibit CYP2C8 and therefore may increase exposure to 
CYP2C8 substrates and therefore caution should be exercised when vadadustat is co-administered 
with CYP2C8 substrates. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data for the use of vadadustat in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of vadadustat during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether vadadustat is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in 
animals have shown excretion of vadadustat in milk (for details, see section 5.3). A risk to infants 
cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
vadadustat therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals showed no effects of vadadustat on fertility (see section 5.3).

The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vafseo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The adverse reactions are based on pooled data from two active-controlled studies in DD-CKD of 
1947 patients treated with Vafseo and 1955 treated with darbepoetin alfa, including 1514 exposed for 
at least 6 months and 1047 exposed for greater than one year to Vafseo.  
The most frequent (> 10%) adverse reactions in patients treated with vadadustat are thromboembolic 
events (13.7%), diarrhoea (12.7%) and hypertension (11.1%). 
The most frequent (≥ 1%) serious adverse reactions in patients treated with vadadustat are 
thromboembolic events (10.0%), hypotension (1.6%) and hypertension (1.1%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
All adverse reactions (ADRs) are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency: very common 
(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Thromboembolic events 
Cerebrovascular accident events occurred in 0.8% vs 0.9% (0.5 vs 0.5 events/100 PY) in the 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) events occurred in 0.7% vs 0.5% (0.4 vs 0.3 events/100 PY) in the 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively. 
Pulmonary embolism events occurred in 0.3% vs 0.5% (0.2 vs 0.3 events/100 PY) in the vadadustat 
and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively. 
Transient ischaemic attack events occurred in 0.8% vs 0.4% (0.5 vs 0.3 events/100 PY) in the 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively. 
Acute myocardial infarction events occurred in 4.3% vs 4.2% (3.1 vs 2.9 events/100 PY) in the 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively. 
Arteriovenous graft thrombosis events occurred in 1.1% vs 1.1% (0.9 vs 1.0 events/100 PY) in the 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively. 
Arteriovenous fistula thrombosis events occurred in 3.0% vs 2.3% (2.1 vs 1.6 events/100 PY) in the 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively. 
For information on cardiovascular and mortality risk and thromboembolism please see sections 4.4 
and 5.1. 
Elevated liver enzymes and blood bilirubin increased  
Hepatocellular injury attributed to Vafseo was uncommonly reported (in less than 0.2% of patients). 
The majority of events were non-serious, asymptomatic and resolved after discontinuation of Vafseo. 
The time to onset was generally within the first 3 months of treatment. Abnormal liver enzymes tests: 
elevated serum ALT (3x ULN), AST (3x ULN), and bilirubin (2x ULN) were seen in 1.8%, 1.4% and 
0.3% of patients treated with Vafseo, respectively. 
There was one serious adverse event of hepatocellular injury with jaundice in an NDD-CKD clinical 
trial patient which occurred approximately 8 weeks after initiating Vafseo. This case was 
multifactorial and resolved after Vafseo and other concomitant medicinal products were discontinued. 
This single case did not meet Hy’s law criteria due to a significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), which preceded the bilirubin elevation, indicating cholestasis as a contributing factor to the 
elevated bilirubin. 
Convulsions  
In DD-CKD patients, convulsions occurred in 1.6% (1.1 patients with events per 100 patient years of 
exposure) in the vadadustat group, and 1.6% (1.3 patients with events per 100 patient years of 
exposure) in the darbepoetin alfa group (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Vadadustat overdose may result in extensions of the pharmacologic effects such as increased Hb and 
secondary polycythemia. Symptoms of vadadustat overdose should be managed as clinically 
appropriate (eg, reduction of Vafseo dose or discontinuation) and careful monitoring and treated as 
clinically indicated. Approximately 16% of the vadadustat dose is removed by dialysis.

5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic preparations, other anti-anaemic preparations, ATC code: 
B03XA08 
Mechanism of action 
Vadadustat is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor which leads to increased cellular 
levels of hypoxia-inducible factor thereby stimulating endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production, 
increasing iron mobilization and red blood cell production, resulting in gradual rate of rise in Hb (see 
Figures 1 and 2). 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Vadadustat did not cause any clinically significant QTc prolongation following a 600 mg and 1200 mg 
dose in healthy subjects. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of vadadustat given once daily for the treatment of anaemia in adult patients 
with CKD was studied compared to darbepoetin alfa in two global multi-centre, randomised, active-
controlled, non-inferiority, open-label studies in DD patients. 
The population in DD-CKD for Vafseo was 19 to 93 years of age, 55.9% male, and the percentage of 
Caucasian, Hispanic, Black (including African Americans) and Asian patients was 64.5%, 38.5%, 
24.1%, and 4.5%, respectively. 
In both studies, non-inferiority of vadadustat to darbepoetin alfa was to be concluded if the lower 
bound of the 95% CI for the difference in estimated mean change in average Hb from Baseline in the 
2 treatment groups was greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -0.75 g/dL.  
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive Vafseo with a starting dose of 300 mg once daily or 
darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously or intravenously as per prescribing information for 
52 weeks to assess the efficacy endpoints. Vafseo was titrated in increments/reductions of 150 mg up 
to 600 mg to achieve the patient’s Hb target. After 52 weeks, patients were continued study treatment 
to assess long-term safety until the event-driven major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) 
endpoints were reached. The primary efficacy endpoint for each study was the difference in mean 
change of Hb from baseline to the primary evaluation period (Weeks 24 to 36). The key secondary 
efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the secondary evaluation 
period (Weeks 40 to 52). The primary safety endpoint was time to first MACE. MACE was defined as 
all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. 
Treatment of anaemia 
The two studies INNO2VATE 1 and INNO2VATE 2 were conducted in adult DD-CKD patients with 
baseline Hb values between 8.0 to 11.0 g/dL in the United States (US) and 9.0 to 12.0 g/dL outside the 
US. INNO2VATE 1 included patients with incident DD-CKD who initiated dialysis within 16 weeks 
of beginning their trial participation and who were erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)-naive, had 
limited prior ESA use or were maintained on ESAs. INNO2VATE 2 included patients on chronic 
maintenance dialysis for more than 12 weeks who had converted from prior ESA therapy. In both 
studies, Vafseo met the primary Hb endpoint according to predefined noninferiority margin 
(- 0.75 g/dL). Results for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are provided in Table 4. 
Course of Hb during treatment in individual studies is provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Cardiovascular outcomes 
The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was evaluated as part of the long-term 
safety evaluation of the two global efficacy studies in DD-CKD patients. Vafseo met the composite 
primary safety endpoint defined as non-inferiority of Vafseo to darbepoetin alfa in time to occurrence 
of MACE for the global study population (1.3 NI margin [HR (95% CI) was 0.96 (0.83, 1.11)]) (see 
Table 5).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Vafseo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of anaemia associated 
with chronic disorders (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Vadadustat is rapidly absorbed after single and repeated oral doses. Median time to peak plasma 
concentrations (Tmax) is approximately 2 to 3 hours.  
No significant accumulation has been observed after repeated dosing in healthy subjects.  
Vafseo may be administered with or without food. Administration of a 450 mg Vafseo tablet with a 
standard high-fat meal decreased Cmax by 27% and decreased the AUC by 6%, relative to fasted 
conditions. 
Distribution 
Vadadustat is highly protein bound (greater than or equal to 99.5% in human plasma). The mean blood 
to plasma ratio was less than 1 (0.50 to 0.55) suggesting minimal sequestration into red blood cells 
(RBCs). In patients with CKD the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 11.6 L. 
Biotransformation 
Vadadustat is primarily metabolised via direct glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) enzymes to O-glucuronide conjugates. The major metabolite vadadustat-O-glucuronide (15% 
of the AUC of plasma radioactivity). Vadadustat acyl glucuronide (0.047% of the total radioactivity in 
plasma) is a minor metabolite. Vadadustat metabolites are not active. 
Elimination 
The half-life of vadadustat in DD-CKD patients was 9.2 hours. After a single oral dose of 
radiolabelled vadadustat 650 mg to healthy adults, 85.9% of the dose was recovered (58.9% in urine 
and 26.9% in faeces). The excretion for vadadustat (unchanged form) was less than 1% in urine and 
about 9% in faeces. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Renal impairment 
14 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vadadustat exposures in DD-CKD patients were approximately 2-fold higher compared to healthy 
subjects. No significant differences in pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC or mean half-life) were observed 
when Vafseo was administered 4 hours before dialysis or 2 hours after dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) did not significantly affect the AUC or Cmax of 
vadadustat compared to healthy subjects. The half-life and apparent total body clearance for 
vadadustat were comparable between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with 
moderate hepatic function. Vadadustat has not been studied in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class C). 
Age, gender, race, and body weight 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis did not suggest any clinically significant effects of age 
(19 to 104 years), gender, race, or body weight (47 to 118 kg) on the pharmacokinetics of vadadustat. 
A sensitivity analysis at body weight extremes (30.1 to 204 kg) showed that the dose titration 
algorithm resulted in predicted Hb levels at the limits of the predefined window of 10 to 12 g/dL. 
Therefore, no dose-adjustment is proposed at body weight extremes. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In non-clinical trials, mortalities were observed in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs due to exaggerated 
pharmacological effects such as polycythemia and hyperviscosity of the blood, leading to thrombosis 
and organ infarct at dose levels that were clinically relevant (starting from exposure multiples of 0.04 
to the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 600 mg). 
Non-clinical data reveal no other special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. 
Vadadustat was not teratogenic in either the rat or the rabbit up to the highest dose level tested 
(160 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively), corresponding to 1.7 and 0.16 times the human 
exposure at the 600 mg dose (based on AUC in NDD-CKD patients), respectively, in the dams. 
Development effects were noted only in the rat at dose levels corresponding to 1.7 times the human 
exposure at the 600 mg dose; characterised as a decrease in foetal body weight and an increased 
incidence of a reduction in skeletal ossification, both of which were considered secondary to the 
decline in body weight and food consumption in the pregnant dams. However, in a rat dose finding 
study, at doses that caused significant maternal toxicity, there was an increase in postimplantation loss 
at ≥ 120 mg/kg/day and decreased foetal body weight at 240 mg/kg/day, but no teratogenicity. 
Vadadustat was excreted in the milk in rats with a ratio of milk to plasma of up to 14.49.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Vafseo is and what it is used for 
Vafseo is a medicine that increases the amount of haemoglobin (the protein in your red blood cells 
that carries oxygen around the body) and the number of red blood cells in your blood. It contains the 
active substance vadadustat. 
Vafseo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia (low levels of red blood cells or haemoglobin in your 
blood) that is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults on chronic maintenance dialysis. 
When the amount of haemoglobin or the number of red blood cells is low, the cells in your body might 
not receive enough oxygen. Anaemia can cause symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, or shortness of 
breath. 
How Vafseo works 
Vafseo increases the level of a substance called “Hypoxia-Inducible Factor” (HIF), which increases 
the production of red blood cells when oxygen levels are low. By raising HIF levels, Vafseo increases 
the production of red blood cells and raises the levels of haemoglobin. This improves the oxygen 
supply to your body and may reduce your anaemia symptoms. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Vafseo 
Do not take Vafseo 
• 
if you are allergic to vadadustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vafseo if you: 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
had blood clots in the past and/or have risk factors for blood clots. This medicine increases the 
production of red blood cells and this may increase the risk of developing blood clots. 
Examples of risk factors are: 
being overweight 
- 
diabetes 
- 
heart diseases 
- 
being off your feet for a long time because of surgery or illness 
- 
- 
taking oral contraceptives 
It is important that you tell your doctor about previous heart attack, stroke, blood clots or risk 
factors so your doctor can decide if this medicine is a suitable treatment for your anaemia.  
Talk to your doctor immediately if you think you have developed a blood clot. You can find a 
description of possible blood clot symptoms below in section 4. 
have high blood pressure (hypertension). Vafseo may worsen your high blood pressure. 
Therefore, it is very important that you take your high blood pressure medicines regularly and 
that you frequently check your blood pressure. 
have severe liver disease. 
have a convulsion or fit or possible warning signs that a convulsion may occur, such as 
headache, irritability, fear, confusion or unusual feelings 
are converting from high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) because you might 
require red blood cell transfusion or supplemental ESA while the doctor is adjusting your 
Vafseo dose. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vafseo if you have any of the conditions mentioned 
above. 
Misuse can lead to an increase in red blood cells and consequently thicken the blood. This can cause 
life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. 
Blood tests 
Chronic kidney disease can cause anaemia, which may increase the risk of heart and blood vessel 
problems and even death. Therefore, it is important to treat your anaemia. Your doctor will regularly 
check the amount of haemoglobin in your blood. 
The treatment may increase liver enzymes. Your doctor will regularly check the amount of these 
enzymes in your blood at the start of your treatment and then monthly for the first 3 months of your 
treatment.  
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Vafseo to children and adolescents aged under 18 years. There is not enough information

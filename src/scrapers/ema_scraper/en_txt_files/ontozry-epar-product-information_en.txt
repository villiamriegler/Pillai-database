CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ontozry is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of focal-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation in adult patients with epilepsy who have not been adequately controlled despite a 
history of treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic medicinal products. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended starting dose of cenobamate is 12.5 mg per day, titrated gradually to the 
recommended target dose of 200 mg per day. Based on clinical response, dose may be increased to a 
maximum of 400 mg per day. 
The recommended titration schedule is provided in table 1, which should not be exceeded because of 
the potential for serious adverse reactions (see section 4.8).

Some patients, who do not reach optimal seizure control, may 
benefit from doses above 200 mg (increased by increments of 
50 mg/day every two weeks) up to a maximum of 400 mg 
daily.  
Missed doses  
If patients miss one dose, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they remember, 
unless it is less than 12 hours until their next regularly scheduled dose. 
Discontinuation  
It is recommended that discontinuation be undertaken gradually to minimise the potential for rebound 
seizures (i.e. over at least 2 weeks), unless safety concerns require abrupt withdrawal. 
Elderly (65 years of age and above)  
Clinical studies of cenobamate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over, to 
determine whether they responded differently from younger patients. It has been reported that elderly 
subjects on antiepileptic medicinal products have higher incidence of adverse reactions such as 
fatigue, gait disturbance, fall, ataxia, balance disorder, dizziness and somnolence. In general, dose 
selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, 
reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function and of concomitant disease as 
well as the potential interactions in polymedicated patients (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment  
Cenobamate should be used with caution and reduction of the target dose may be considered in 
patients with mild to moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to <90 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min) renal impairment. The maximum recommended dose for patients with mild, moderate, or 
severe renal impairment is 300 mg/day. Cenobamate should not be used in patients with end-stage 
renal disease or patients undergoing haemodialysis. 
Hepatic impairment  
Exposure to cenobamate was increased in patients with chronic hepatic disease. A change in the 
starting dose is not required; however, a decrease in target doses of up to 50% may need to be 
considered. The maximum recommended dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
is 200 mg/day. Cenobamate should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Ontozry in children aged 0 months to 18 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Oral use. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cenobamate should typically be taken once daily as single oral dose at any time. However, it should 
preferably be taken at the same time each day. It may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
The tablet should be swallowed with a glass of water. The tablets cannot be split accurately as there is 
no break line and the accuracy of the dose cannot be ensured. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Familial Short-QT syndrome (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation  
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicinal 
products  including cenobamate. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-
epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. 
The mechanism of this risk is not known. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal 
ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. 
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal 
ideation or behaviour emerge.  
Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)  
Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or 
fatal, has been reported in association with cenobamate when started at higher doses and titrated 
rapidly (weekly or faster titration) (see section 4.8). When cenobamate was initiated at 12.5 mg/day 
and titrated every two weeks, in an open-label safety study of 1,340 epilepsy patients, no cases of 
DRESS were reported.  
At the time of prescription, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of DRESS and 
monitored closely for skin reactions. Symptoms of DRESS include typically, although not exclusively, 
fever, rash associated with other organ system involvement, lymphadenopathy, liver function tests 
abnormalities and eosinophilia. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, 
such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If signs and 
symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, cenobamate should be withdrawn immediately and an 
alternative treatment considered (as appropriate).  
QT-shortening  
A dose-dependent shortening of the QTcF interval has been observed with cenobamate. Reductions of 
the QTcF interval below 340 msec were not observed (see section 5.1). In clinical trials there was no 
evidence that the combination of cenobamate with other antiepileptic medicines led to further QT-
shortening. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing cenobamate in combination with other 
medicinal products that are known to shorten the QT.  
Familial Short QT syndrome is a rare genetic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of 
sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Cenobamate must not be 
used in patients with Familial Short-QT syndrome (see section 4.3). 
Contains lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems such as galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cenobamate is extensively metabolized, primarily by glucuronidation, with oxidation contributing to a 
lesser degree.  
Cenobamate may reduce exposures of products primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and 2B6. 
Cenobamate may increase exposures of products primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. When initiating 
or discontinuing treatment with cenobamate or changing the dose, it may take 2 weeks to reach the 
new level of enzyme activity.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
CNS depressants 
Concomitant use of cenobamate with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates, and 
benzodiazepines may increase the risk of neurological adverse reactions. Therefore, based on 
individual response, doses of barbiturates and benzodiazepines may need to be reduced, as clinically 
appropriate, when used concomitantly with cenobamate. 
Interactions with other antiepileptics 
Phenytoin 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 200 mg/day and phenytoin 
300 mg/day slightly reduced cenobamate exposures (Cmax by -27%, AUC by -28%), and increased 
phenytoin exposures (Cmax by 67%, AUC by 84%). No dose adjustment of cenobamate is required. 
Phenytoin concentrations should be monitored during titration of cenobamate, and based on individual 
response, the dose of phenytoin may need to be reduced.  
Phenobarbital 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 200 mg/day and 
phenobarbital 90 mg/day did not cause clinically meaningful changes in cenobamate exposure but led 
to increased phenobarbital exposures (Cmax by 34% and AUC by 37%). No dose adjustment of 
cenobamate is required. Concentrations of phenobarbital should be monitored during cenobamate 
titration, and based on individual response, the dose of phenobarbital may need to be reduced. 
Clobazam 
Pharmacometric analyses of data from healthy subjects and patients predict that clobazam slightly 
increases cenobamate exposures (by 24%). No dose adjustment of cenobamate is required. 
Due to a possible increase in exposure of the active metabolite of clobazam (N-desmethylclobazam), 
related to the induction of CYP3A4 (formation) and the inhibition of CYP2C19 (elimination), the dose 
of clobazam may need to be reduced. 
Lamotrigine 
Pharmacometric analyses of data from healthy subjects and patients showed that concomitant 
administration of cenobamate with lamotrigine had no effect on cenobamate exposures, but resulted in 
dose-dependent decreases in lamotrigine concentrations (by -21%, -35%, and -52% for cenobamate 
100, 200, and 400 mg/day). Based on subpopulation analyses of patients taking concomitant 
lamotrigine, higher doses (200 - 400 mg/day) of cenobamate may be required for efficacy when co-
administered with lamotrigine. Depending on individual response, the dose of cenobamate may need 
to be increased.  
Carbamazepine 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 200 mg once daily and 
carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily showed no significant change in exposure of cenobamate, but 
carbamazepine exposures were slightly reduced (Cmax reduced by 23%, AUC reduced by 24%). No 
clinically meaningful decreases in efficacy were observed in subpopulation analyses of patients taking 
concomitant carbamazepine. Therefore, no dose adjustments are required.  
Valproic acid 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 150 mg once daily and 
valproic acid 1,000 mg once daily showed no significant changes in exposures of either medicinal 
product.  
Pharmacometric analyses of data from healthy subjects and patients indicated that concomitant 
administration of cenobamate with valproic acid did not affect cenobamate exposures and had no 
clinically relevant reductions in valproic acid concentration. No dose adjustments are required. 
Lacosamide, levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine 
Pharmacometric analyses of data from healthy subjects and patients indicated that concomitant 
administration with lacosamide, levetiracetam, or oxcarbazepine did not affect the exposure of 
cenobamate, and cenobamate did not have a clinically relevant effect on exposures of lacosamide, 
levetiracetam, or oxcarbazepine. No dose adjustments are required for cenobamate, lacosamide, 
levetiracetam, or oxcarbazepine.  
Other medicinal products 
Oral contraceptives 
Cenobamate showed a dose-dependent induction of CYP3A4, reducing exposures (AUC) of the 
CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam 2 mg by 72% with cenobamate 200 mg/day in healthy subjects. Since 
hormonal contraceptives may also be metabolized by CYP3A4, their efficacy may be reduced by 
concomitant use with cenobamate. Therefore, women of reproductive potential concomitantly using 
oral contraceptives should practice additional or alternative non-hormonal measures of birth control 
(see section 4.6).  
CYP3A4 substrates 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 100 and 200 mg once daily 
reduced exposures (AUC) of the CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam 2 mg by 27% and 72%, respectively. 
An increase in the dose of medicines metabolized by CYP3A4 may be required when used 
concomitantly with cenobamate.  
CYP2B6 substrates 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 200 mg once daily reduced 
exposures of the CYP2B6 substrate, bupropion 150 mg (Cmax reduced by 23%, AUC reduced by 39%). 
An increase in the dose of medicines metabolized by CYP2B6 may be required when used 
concomitantly with cenobamate.  
CYP2C19 substrates 
In a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of cenobamate 200 mg once daily increased 
exposures of the CYP2C19 substrate, omeprazole 20 mg (Cmax increase by 83%, AUC increased by 
107%). A dose reduction of medicines metabolized by CYP2C19 may be required when used 
concomitantly with cenobamate.  
OAT3 substrates 
In vitro studies have shown that cenobamate inhibits OAT3, a transporter predominantly involved in 
the elimination of certain medicines (e.g. baricitinib, cefaclor, empagliflozin, penicillin G, ritobegron, 
and sitagliptin). Therefore, concomitant administration of cenobamate and medicinal products 
transported by OAT3 may result in higher exposure of these medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential and contraception in males and females 
Cenobamate is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Women 
of reproductive potential concomitantly using oral contraceptives should practice additional or 
alternative non-hormonal measures of birth control during treatment with cenobamate and until 4 
weeks after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.5). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
It has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the prevalence of 
malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general 
population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy; 
however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible has not been 
elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the disease 
which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. 
Risk related to cenobamate 
There are no adequate data from the use of Ontozry in pregnant women. 
Animal studies have shown that cenobamate crosses the placenta of rats. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity at levels below clinical exposure (see section 5.3). Ontozry should not be 
used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with cenobamate. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during use of cenobamate and until 
4 weeks after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.5). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether cenobamate or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Studies in rats showed excretion of cenobamate in the maternal milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the 
suckling child cannot be excluded. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment with Ontozry. 
Fertility 
The effects of cenobamate on human fertility are unknown. Animal data are insufficient due to 
exposure below clinical levels (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ontozry has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
Cenobamate may cause somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, impaired vision and other CNS-related 
symptoms, which may influence the ability to drive or use machines. Patients are advised not to drive 
a vehicle, operate complex machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is 
known whether cenobamate affects their ability to perform these tasks (see section 4.5). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue and headache. 
The discontinuation rates because of adverse reactions in clinical trials were 5%, 6% and 19% for 
patients randomised to receive cenobamate at doses of 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day 
respectively, compared to 3% in patients randomised to receive placebo. The 400 mg dose was more 
associated with adverse reactions especially when taken concomitantly with clobazam. 
The adverse reactions most commonly leading to discontinuation, in descending order of frequency, 
were: ataxia (1.6% vs 0.5% placebo), dizziness (1.6% vs 0.5% placebo), somnolence (1.4% vs 0.5% 
placebo), nystagmus (0.7% vs 0 % placebo), vertigo (0.7% vs 0 % placebo) and diplopia (0.5% vs 0 % 
placebo). These adverse reactions are dose dependent and the titration scheme should be strictly 
followed).

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)  
Three cases of DRESS were reported within 2 to 4 weeks of starting cenobamate in studies with high 
starting doses (50 mg or 100 mg once daily) and weekly or faster titration. When cenobamate was 
initiated at 12.5 mg/day and titrated every two weeks, in an open-label safety study of 1,340 epilepsy 
patients, no cases of DRESS were reported.  
At the time of prescription, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of DRESS and 
monitored closely for skin reactions. Symptoms of DRESS include typically, although not exclusively, 
fever, rash associated with other organ system involvement, lymphadenopathy, liver function tests 
abnormalities and eosinophilia. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, 
such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If signs and 
symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, cenobamate should be withdrawn immediately and an 
alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). Ontozry should always be initiated at 12.5 mg once 
daily and titrated not faster than once every two weeks (see sections 4.2 and 4.4.). 
Hypersensitivity 
Four (0.9%) Cenobamate treated patients and one (0.5%) placebo patient experienced an event of 
hypersensitivity. Two patients in the cenobamate dose group experienced events of drug 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity. One cenobamate treated patient experienced an event of hypersensitivity and 1 
cenobamate treated patient experienced an event on eyelid oedema. The placebo patient experienced 
an event of hypersensitivity. All events were classified as mild or moderate. 
Elderly  
Safety data from the Pooled Double-Blind and All Phase 2/3 datasets along with PK data from a 
Phase 1 study showed no additional safety risks in elderly subjects >65 years of age at study entry. 
Additional subgrouping by age for subjects who were >65 years of age during study participation 
showed similar results for adverse reactions in these 87 subjects as compared with the 51 subjects who 
were >65 years of age at study entry (see section 4.2). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms of overdose are expected to be consistent with the known adverse reactions of Ontozry and 
include somnolence, fatigue, dizziness. There is no available specific antidote to the effects of 
cenobamate. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and 
observation of the clinical status of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX25. 
Mechanism of action 
Cenobamate is a small molecule with a dual mechanism of action. It is a positive allosteric modulator 
of subtypes of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) ion channel, that does not bind to the benzodiazepine 
binding site. Cenobamate has also been shown to reduce repetitive neuronal firing by enhancing the 
inactivation of sodium channels and by inhibiting the persistent component of the sodium current. The 
precise mechanism of action by which cenobamate exercises its therapeutic effects in patients with focal-
onset seizures is unknown. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In a placebo-controlled QT study in healthy volunteers, dose-dependent shortening of the QTcF interval 
has been observed with cenobamate. The mean ΔΔQTcF is -10.8 [CI: -13.4, -8.2] msec for 200 mg once 
daily and -18.4 [CI: -21.5, -15.2] msec for 500 mg once daily (1.25 times the maximum recommended 
dosage). Reductions of the QTc interval below 340 msec were not observed (see section 4.4). 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
The efficacy of cenobamate as adjunctive therapy in focal-onset seizures was studied in a multi-centre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult patients with focal-onset epilepsy who 
have not been adequately controlled despite a history of treatment with anti-epileptic products. 
Patients were treated with one to three concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products that remained 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stable over the course of double-blind study treatment. The daily dose of cenobamate ranged from 
100 to 400 mg/day.  
The study had an 8-week prospective baseline period, during which patients were required to have at 
least 3 or 4 partial-onset seizures per 28 days with no seizure-free period exceeding 3 to 4 weeks, 
followed by an 18-week treatment period including 12 weeks at fixed. The most commonly taken 
antiepileptic medicinal products at the time of study entry were levetiracetam, lamotrigine, 
carbamazepine and lacosamide. All subjects who entered the study continued to have seizures, despite 
a majority having had a history of treatment with 2 or more antiepileptic medicinal products. More 
than 80% of patients were taking two or more concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products at the time 
of study enrolment. The efficacy outcomes are summarised in table 3.  
The study compared doses of cenobamate 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day with placebo, on 
top of standard of care. Subjects continued stable treatment on one to three background antiepileptic 
medicinal products. Patients were started on a daily dose of 50 mg and subsequently increased by 
50 mg/day every week until 200 mg/day was reached and then increased by 100 mg/day every week in 
subjects randomised to 400 mg/day. 
Table 3 shows the proportion of patients who exhibited a 50% or greater reduction in seizure 
frequency from baseline.

Figure 1: Cumulative distribution of percent reduction in seizures from baseline by treatment 
group in the 12-week fixed-dose period in the Study   
In the study, 4 of 102 (3.9%) patients in the cenobamate 100 mg/day group, 11 of 98 (11.2%) patients 
in the cenobamate 200 mg/day group, 20 of 95 (21.1%) patients in the cenobamate 400 mg/day group 
and 1 of 102 (1%) of patients in the placebo group obtained seizure freedom (100% reduction in 
seizures) during the 12-week fixed-dose phase. Similar responses were seen across subpopulations 
greater than or less than median seizure frequency, and greater than or less than median disease 
duration. 
Long term open label study 
The majority of subjects chose to enter the open-label extension from Study 1 (98.9%). 80% of 
subjects remained in the study for at least 12 months, and 58% for at least 60 months. Additional 
seizure frequency data were collected and were consistent with the results from the double-blind 
portion of the study.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ontozry in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Cenobamate is well absorbed (at least 88% based on urine recovery) after oral administration, with 
median Tmax ranging from 1 to 4 hours after single- or multiple-dose administration under fasted 
condition over the range of 10 to 400 mg.  
Co-administration with a high-fat meal (800-1,000 kcal with 50% fat) showed no significant effect on 
the rate and the extent of absorption of cenobamate.  
Distribution 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of cenobamate after oral administration is approximately 
40-50 L. Plasma protein binding of cenobamate is 60% and independent of concentration in vitro. 
Cenobamate primarily binds with human albumin protein.  
Biotransformation 
Cenobamate  is  extensively  metabolised.  The  primary  metabolic  pathway  is  glucuronidation  via 
UGT2B7 and to a lesser extent by UGT2B4. Minor pathways for metabolism of cenobamate include 
oxidation via CYP2E1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.  
Elimination 
Cenobamate and its metabolites are eliminated primarily via urine. Excretion via faeces accounted for 
only 5.2% of the dose. More than 50% of the dose was excreted within 72 hours. The apparent 
terminal half-life of cenobamate in plasma was 50-60 hours within the therapeutic range of 
100 mg/day to 400 mg/day. Steady state is reached by 14 days. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The Cmax of cenobamate increased proportionally with increasing doses following single oral doses 
from 5 to 750 mg and multiple oral doses from 50 to 500 mg/day. Steady-state exposures (Cmax and 
AUC) increased proportionally with increasing doses in the therapeutic range (100 to 400 mg), but 
doses less than 100 mg/day may be cleared faster.  
Special populations  
Renal impairment  
Cenobamate plasma AUC was 1.4-fold to 1.5-fold higher in subjects with mild (CLcr 
60 to < 90 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr 30 to < 60 mL/min) renal impairment following a single oral 
200 mg dose of cenobamate compared to healthy controls. In subjects with severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) 
renal impairment, cenobamate plasma AUC did not change significantly compared to healthy controls 
following single oral 100 mg dose of cenobamate (see section 4.2), The effect of haemodialysis on 
cenobamate pharmacokinetics has not been studied.  
Hepatic impairment  
Cenobamate plasma AUC was 1.9-fold and 2.3-fold higher in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment, respectively, following a single oral 200 mg dose of cenobamate compared to matched 
healthy controls (see section 4.2). The effect of severe hepatic impairment on cenobamate 
pharmacokinetics has not been studied.  
Gender  
There was no difference observed in the pharmacokinetics of cenobamate between male and female 
patients. 
Ethnicity 
No clinically significant effect of ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of cenobamate was noted in a 
population PK analysis of pooled data from clinical studies from subjects categorised as Asian, Black, 
Caucasian, Hispanic or other. 
Body weight  
A 45% decrease in exposure has been estimated across a body weight range from 54 kg to 112 kg. 
This variability is not considered to be clinically relevant when establishing a dose of cenobamate. 
However, cenobamate dose adjustments may need to be considered in patients who experience weight 
changes of ≥30% of their initial body weight, or more. 
Elderly (65 years and above) 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of cenobamate were observed based on 
age based on data from subjects aged 18 years to 77 years. 
Paediatric population  
Safety and effectiveness of Ontozry in patients less than 18 years of age has not been established. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. However, maximum systemic exposure 
achieved in the carcinogenicity study in rats was less than that in humans at the maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Maximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated CNS effects of 
cenobamate (including hypoactivity, uncoordinated gait, hypothermia, and tremor). Systemic 
exposures at NOAEL (no observed adverse effect levels) were similar to or below exposures reached 
in humans at the MRHD. 
Toxicity to reproduction and development 
Reproductive toxicity studies with once daily oral administration showed adverse effects on embryo-
foetal and postnatal development. No adverse effects were observed on fertility in a dedicated study in 
rats. However, systemic exposures at the respective NOAELs for the fertility, embryo-foetal 
development, pre- and postnatal development studies were below human exposure at the MRHD. 
Cenobamate did not show any teratogenic effects when orally administered twice daily to female rats 
and  once  daily  to  female  rabbits,  during  the  period  of  organogenesis.  However,  administration  of 
cenobamate to pregnant rabbits resulted in increased embryo-foetal mortality, at a dose level associated 
with maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at the respective NOELs (no observed effect levels) was 
below human exposure at the MRHD. 
When cenobamate was administered to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation, 
neurobehavioural impairment (increased auditory startle response) was observed in the offspring at all 
doses and decreased preweaning body weight gain and adverse reactions on female reproductive 
function (decreased numbers of corpora lutea, implantations and live foetuses) were seen in the 
offspring.  
Placental and lacteal transfer of cenobamate was confirmed by the presence of cenobamate in both 
amniotic fluid and foetal blood from pregnant rats and in the milk of lactating rats.  
The environmental risk assessment demonstrated that cenobamate is very persistent (vP) in aquatic 
systems (see section 6.6).

1.  What Ontozry is and what it is used for 
Ontozry contains the active substance cenobamate. It belongs to a group of medicines called ‘anti-
epileptics’. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy, a condition where someone has seizures or fits 
because of abnormal activity in the brain.  
Ontozry is used in combination with other antiepileptic medicines in adult patients with epilepsy who 
have not been adequately controlled despite a history of treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic 
products, to treat a type of epilepsy that has focal-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation. Focal-onset seizures are those caused by abnormal brain activity starting in a part of the 
brain on one side, and secondary generalisation means that that the abnormal activity is spreading to 
both sides of the brain. The medicine can be used only in adults.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Ontozry

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cenobamate, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including 11 Individual Case 
Safety Reports with a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between cenobamate and “suicidal ideation” is at least a reasonable possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing cenobamate should be 
amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall 
conclusions and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cenobamate the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cenobamate is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

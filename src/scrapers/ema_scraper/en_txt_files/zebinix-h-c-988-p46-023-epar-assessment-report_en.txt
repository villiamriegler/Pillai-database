Introduction 
On  9th  April  2014,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  eslicarbazepine  acetate  (BIA-
2093-305), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study  BIA-2093-305  is  part  of  the  paediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  for  eslicarbazepine  acetate 
(P/0197/2013 issued on 2 September 2013).  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Scientific discussion 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies) 
Study  treatments  were  provided  as  an  oral  suspension  (50  mg/mL)  for  use  in  the  age  group  of  2–6 
years (stratum I) or as white oblong tablets (200 mg) for use in the older children and adolescents (≥7 
years of age; strata II and III). 
Clinical aspects 
Study BIA-2093-305, title “Efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093) as 
adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures in children: a double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre clinical trial” 
Description 
This was a phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, multicentre, parallel group (part I) 
trial  to  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  of  eslicarbazepine  acetate  (ESL)  as  adjunctive  therapy  for 
refractory  partial  seizures  in  children  aged  2  to  less  than  18  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  partial  onset 
seizures  that  were  refractory  to  treatment  with  1  to  2  anti-epileptic  drugs  (AEDs)  with  4  subsequent 
one year open-label extension phases (part II-V).  
Study  BIA-2093-305  has  a  date  of  completion  of  September  2015  as  per  agreed  PIP  (EMEA-00069-
PIP02-M04).  The  first  patient  was  enrolled  by  07  December  2007  and  the  date  of  last  patients 
completing the first open-label extension period (part II) was 22 October 2013.  
The  MAH  has  thus  reported  procedures  and  results  to  parts  I  and  II  of  the  study  in  the  current 
submission.  In  the  study  report  covering  part  I  and  II  of  the  study  it  is  stated,  that  separate  study 
reports will be written for parts III-IV of the study.  
Methods 
•

frequency. 
− 
−  The frequency of patients with exacerbations. 
−  The duration of seizures and severity of seizures (using the Hague seizure severity scale). 
−  The potential for rebound effects and withdrawal phenomena. 
−  The potential for interactions between ESL and concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
−  The seizure frequency by seizure type. 
−  The  maintenance  of  the  therapeutic  effect  of  ESL  during  long-term  treatment  in  Part  II,  Part 
III, Part IV, and Part V of the study. 
• 
Study design/Treatments 
A  phase  III,  randomised,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled,  multinational  parallel-group  (part  I)  study 
with 4 subsequent long-term, open-label extension periods (parts II-V).  
Part I consisted of the following treatment periods: 
−  An 8-week observational baseline period:  
Patients entered the baseline period after the screening visit (Visit 1). At the end of the baseline period 
(Visit  2),  eligible  patients  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  (stratified  by  age:  stratum  I:  2-6  years; 
stratum II: 7-11 years; stratum III: 12-18 years) to receive ESL or placebo in addition to concomitant 
therapy with 1 or 2 AEDs. 
−  A 6-week double-blind titration period:  
The  recommended  dose  (“target  dose”)  of  double-blind  study  treatment  was  20  mg/kg/day  (up  to  a 
maximum of 1200 mg/day). 
−  A 12-week double-blind maintenance period:  
After the titration period, patients entered the 12-week maintenance period (from Visit 4 to 7).  
Patients received a maximum dose of 30mg/kg/day (maximum of 1200 mg/day).  
Up-titration was not permitted during the maintenance period; down-titration was allowed only once. 
−  An up to 4-week double-blind tapering-off period:  
Study treatment was tapered off in 10 mg/kg/day steps or in the same doses given during the titration 
period (as applicable) every 2 weeks. 
−  A 4-week observational follow-up period. 
Part II of the study consisted of the following: 
−  A 48-week open-label extension period:  
The starting ESL dose was 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 800 mg/day).  
The  dose  was  titrated  according  to  clinical  response  in  the  dose  range  from  10  mg/kg/day  to  30 
mg/kg/day (or 800 mg/day to a maximum of 1200 mg/day). Down-titration was allowed. 
•

Main criteria for inclusion: 
−  Diagnosis  of  epilepsy  for  at  least  6  months  prior  to  enrolment;  for  patients  from  the  Czech 
Republic: diagnosis of epilepsy for at least 24 months prior to enrolment (Amendment 1 Czech 
Republic, 05 Oct 2007).

−  At  least  4  partial-onset  seizures  in  the  last  month  prior  to  enrolment  despite  stable  therapy 
with adequate dosage of 1 or 2 AEDs; for patients from the Czech Republic: at least 4 partial-
onset  seizures  in  the  last  month  prior  to  enrolment  despite  stable  therapy  with  adequate 
dosage of 2 AEDs (Amendment 1 Czech Republic, 05 Oct 2007). 
−  At least 4 partial-onset seizures during each 4-week interval of the 8-week baseline period. 
−  Stable dose regimen of AEDs during the 8-week baseline period. 
−  Current treatment with 1 or 2 AEDs (any AED except oxcarbazepine); if present, vagus nerve 
stimulation  is  considered  an  AED  (this  last  addition  was  introduced  per  Global  Amendment  1 
[20 Dec 2007]). 
Patients  with  primarily  generalised  seizures,  known  progressive  neurological  disorders,  known  second 
or third degree atrioventricular block (introduced per Global Amendment 4 [16 Sep 2010]), history of 
status  epilepticus  within  the  3  months  prior  to  enrolment,  seizures  of  non-epileptic  origin,  Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome or West syndrome were excluded from the study. 
Planned: 252 patients (126 per treatment group). 
Treated: 304 patients (155 with ESL, 149 with placebo). 
Analysed for efficacy: 
Part  I:  263  in  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  set  (134  ESL,  129  placebo)  (excluding  stratum  I  before 
investigational  medicinal  product  [IMP]  recall);  198  in  per  protocol  set  (97  ESL,  101  placebo);  41  in 
stratum I before IMP recall (21 ESL, 20 placebo). 
Part II: 225 ESL in the ITT set. 
Analysed for safety: 
Part  I:  263  in  the  safety  set  (134  ESL,  129  placebo)  (excluding  stratum  I  before  IMP  recall);  41  in 
stratum I before IMP recall (21 ESL, 20 placebo). 
Part II: 260 ESL in the combined safety set (i.e. all treated patients). 
In the safety set, 37 patients (27.6%) in the ESL group and 28 patients (21.7%) in the placebo group 
had a major protocol violation or a treatment duration in the maintenance period of <11 weeks. These 
patients were therefore excluded from the PP set, which consequently included 97 patients (72.4% of 
the safety set) in the ESL group and 101 (78.3%) in the placebo group. 
The CHMP noted that the percentage of patients with major protocol violations in both treatment 
groups appears rather high, this finding was more pronounced in the active treatment group.

Study disposition flow chart of study 305, part I: 
On  04  Jun  2009,  the  distribution  of  oral  suspension  of  study  medication  was  stopped  due  to  stability 
issues resulting in dark spots visible in the vials. Patients in stratum I (2-6 years of age) who received 
IMP  as  oral  suspension  had  to  stop  intake  immediately  and  any  unused  study  medication  had  to  be 
returned.  On  19  Jun  2009  it  was  decided  to  recall  all  oral  suspension  study  medication.  The 
investigators  were  informed  on  22  Jun  2009  that  patients  had  to  perform  their  EDVs  and  follow-up 
visits. Affected patients were excluded from primary efficacy analyses. Stratum I patients (2-6 years of 
age)  were  offered  to  switch  to  the  tablet  formulation  if  parents  and investigators  were  of  the  opinion 
that the patient could swallow tablets. 
The CHMP noted that after closure of the part I  database and  unblinding, it was found that the issue 
with  the  oral  suspension  only  affected  the  placebo  formulation  and  thus  no  impact  on  efficacy  was 
concluded  in  the  study  report.  Nevertheless,  affected  patients  had  been  excluded  form  the  primary 
efficacy analyses.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Part I of the study 
Two primary efficacy variables were defined:

1.  Responder  rate,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  a  50%  decrease  in  the 
standardised 4-week seizure frequency from the baseline period to the 12-week maintenance period. 
2. Relative reduction in the standardised 4-week seizure frequency from the baseline period to the 12-
week maintenance period. 
The secondary efficacy variables were: 
−  Standardised  seizure  frequency  per  period  of  the  baseline,  titration,  maintenance,  and 
tapering-off periods. 
−  Relative  change  in  seizure  frequency  from  the  baseline  period  to  the  12-week  maintenance 
period (≥25%; >–50% to <25%; ≥–75% to ≤–50%; <–75%). 
−  Proportion of patients who are seizure-free during the maintenance period. 
−  Standardised  seizure  frequency  by  seizure  type  (simple  partial,  complex  partial,  partial 
evolving  to  secondary  generalised,  unclassified,  other)  during  the  maintenance  period. 
Seizures with missing seizure type information were considered as unclassified for the analysis. 
−  Seizure duration (as classified in the diary): <30sec, ≥30 sec - <1 min, ≥1 min - <5 min, ≥5 
min, unknown. 
−  Seizure severity assessed with the 13-item Hague seizure severity scale. 
−  Number of days with seizures (standardised to 4-week time period). 
−  Treatment retention time, defined as the time to first occurrence of one of the following during 
the titration or maintenance period: withdrawal of study medication due to AEs or withdrawal 
of study medication due to lack of efficacy (defined as seizure exacerbation ≥100% compared 
to the baseline period). 
−  Seizure exacerbations during tapering-off or follow-up period. 
Part II of the study 
−  Standardised  seizure  frequency  per  4-/12-week  interval  (weeks  1-4,  5-16,  17-28,  29-40, 
≥41). 
−  Absolute and relative change from Part I baseline in seizure frequency per 4-/12-week interval. 
−  Responder  rate  per  4-/12-week  interval:  responders  were  defined  as  those  patients  with  a 
relative  seizure  reduction  of  at  least  50%  in  the  respective  time  interval  compared  to  Part  I 
baseline. 
−  Categorised  relative  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  4-/12-week  interval:  relative  change  in 
seizure frequency from the Part I baseline period to each 4-/12-week interval (≥25%; >–50% 
to <25%; ≥-75% to ≤–50%; <–75%). 
−  Exacerbations in seizure frequency (increase in relative change in seizure frequency of ≥25%) 
per 4-/12-week interval compared to the Part I baseline and maintenance periods. 
−  Seizure free patients per 4-/12-week interval. 
−  Standardised  seizure  frequency  per  4-/12-week  interval  by  seizure  type  (simple  partial, 
complex  partial,  partial  evolving  to  secondary  generalised,  unclassified,  other):  seizures  with 
missing seizure type information were considered as unclassified for analysis.  
−  Standardised number of days with seizures per 4-/12-week interval.

compared to the baseline period). 
−  Seizure severity (Hague seizure severity scale). 
In  both  study  parts,  safety  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  following  observations  and 
measurements: 
−  Reports of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs). 
−  Safety laboratory (haematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis).

Statistical Methods  
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  2  primary  efficacy  variables.  At  least  100  patients 
treated  with  ESL  were  to  be  followed-up  for  at  least  1  year  and  included  in  safety  analyses.  Both 
primary  variables  were  intended  to  be  sufficiently  powered  with  at  least  80%  power  to  show  a 
significant difference following a hierarchical testing procedure at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
Efficacy analysis: 
Primary (applicable to Part I only): 
The responder rate was analysed by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with stratum group (I: 2-6 
years; II: 7-11 years; III: 12-16 [18] years) as the stratification factor. 
The  relative  reduction  in  standardised  seizure  frequency  was  compared  between  treatment  groups 
using  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  that  modelled  the  relative  change  in  standardised  seizure 
frequency as a function of stratum group (I: 2-6 years; II: 7-11 years; III: 12-16 [18] years), baseline 
seizure frequency, and treatment. 
The  second  primary  null  hypothesis  (no  treatment  difference  with  regard  to  the  relative  reduction  in 
standardised  seizure  frequency)  was  only  tested  if  the  first  primary  null  hypothesis  (no  treatment 
difference with regard to response rates) had been rejected following the hierarchical testing strategy, 
which  controlled  for  type  I  error  inflation  due  to  multiple  testing.  Tests  were  performed  2-sided  at  a 
significance level of 0.05. 
Secondary and Part II efficacy variables: 
Secondary efficacy variables and efficacy variables for Part II of the study were analysed descriptively.

Baseline data 
The median standardised number of seizures during the baseline period was lower in the ESL group 
(11.5; range: 3.7, 605.8) than in the placebo group (17.0; range: 3.9, 1972.5). 
• 
Efficacy results 
Part I  
For both primary  efficacy  variables, the response rate and the relative change in the standardised 
seizure  frequency  during  the  maintenance  period,  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  ESL 
and placebo was found. Forty-one patients (30.6%) in the ESL group compared to 40 patients (31.0%) 
in  the  placebo  group  were  responders,  resulting  in  a  non-significant  odds  ratio  of  0.97  (95% 
confidence  interval  [CI]:  0.57,  1.63;  p=0.9017).  The  least  square  (LS)  mean  relative  change  in  the 
standardised seizure frequency was higher in the ESL group (-18.1%) than in the placebo group  
(-8.6%), resulting in a LS mean difference of 9.5% (95% CI: -6.71, 25.77; p=0.2490).  
Responder rates and corresponding between-treatment differences were identical or similar to those in 
the  primary  analysis  described  above  when  using  the  randomised  set  (identical  to  the  ITT  set;  the 
mITT set, or the PP set (97 ESL patients, 101 placebo patients). 
Secondary efficacy findings were as follows: 
− 
− 
− 
Frequency of seizure-free patients: maintenance period: 3.9% ESL, 2.4% placebo; tapering-off 
period: 9.2% ESL, 12.6% placebo.  
Frequency of patients with seizure reduction of at least 75%: maintenance period: 15.6% ESL, 
12.9% placebo; tapering-off period: 13.4% ESL, 20.3% placebo.  
Frequency of patients with exacerbation (increase of ≥25%): maintenance period: 13.3% ESL, 
13.7% placebo; tapering-off period: 14.3% ESL, 15.3% placebo.

−  Seizure  duration:  The  majority  (>80%)  of  seizures  during  the  maintenance  period  lasted  <1 
minute in both treatment groups.  
−  Seizure  severity:  During  the  study,  small  mean  increases  in  the  total  score  of  the  Hague 
seizure  severity  scale  were  seen  in  both  treatment  groups,  slightly  larger  in  the  ESL  group 
(mean increases between 1.4 and 2.5) than in the placebo group (mean increases between 0.5 
and 1.6). 
−  Number  of  days  with  seizures:  In  each  study  period,  the  mean  standardised  number  of  days 
with seizures was slightly lower in the ESL group than in the placebo group. In both treatment 
groups, the mean standardised number of days with seizures was highest during the baseline 
period  (12.2  days  ESL;  13.9  days  placebo)  and  lowest  during  the  maintenance  period  (9.3 
days ESL; 11.9 days placebo). 
−  There  was  no  interaction  between  the  number  of  concomitant  AEDs  or  concomitant 
carbamazepine  and  treatment  in  the  ANCOVA  of  the  relative  change  in  standardised  seizure 
frequency. 
−  No rebound effects were observed. The standardised seizure frequency during tapering-off and 
follow-up periods increased in relation to maintenance period, but not to a value greater than 
that observed at baseline. Furthermore, the increase in standardised seizure frequency during 
tapering-off and follow-up periods in relation to baseline was similar in both treatment groups. 
−  Efficacy  results  showed  a  trend  in  favour  of  ESL  compared  to  placebo  when  the  standardised 
seizure  frequency  is  based  on  the  titration  +  maintenance  period  instead  of  the  maintenance 
period, and also when the ITT (Intended to treat) set is restricted to patients from strata II and 
III. However, between-treatment differences were not statistically significant. 
−  A  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  ESL  compared  to  placebo  was  observed  in  an 
analysis  of  the  relative  change  in  standardised  seizure  frequency  during  the  titration  + 
maintenance period based on patients in strata II and III (difference 16.2%; p=0.0359). 
The CHMP noted that in part I of study 305 no superior efficacy of ESL over placebo could be shown as 
adjunctive treatment in children with refractory partial onset seizures. The only statistically significant 
difference in favour of ESL compared to placebo (in an analysis of the relative change in standardised 
seizure  frequency  during  the  titration  +  maintenance  period  based  on  patients  in  strata  II  and  III) 
resulted from a post-hoc analysis.   
Part II 
Efficacy findings in Part II per variable in the total ITT set were as follows: 
−  The total responder rate during Part II was 46.7%. Responder rates steadily increased during 
Part II, from 44.9% during weeks 1-4 to 57.5% during weeks >40. 
−  The total median standardised seizure frequency during Part II was 6.1, resulting in a median 
relative  change  compared  to  the  baseline  period  of  -46.7%.  The  median  relative  change  was 
larger  in  the  previous  placebo  group  (-51.4%)  than  in  the  previous  ESL  group  (-40.4%).  The 
total  median  standardised  seizure  frequency  decreased  from  7.0  during  weeks  1-4  to  4.0 
during weeks >40. 
− 
Five  patients  (2.2%)  were  seizure-free  during  Part  II.  The  proportion  of  seizure-free  patients 
was 8.9% during weeks 1-4, 6.7% during weeks 5-16, 13.8% during weeks 17-28, and 14.2% 
during weeks 29-40.

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/414667/2014 
Page 9/14 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
−  The  proportion  of  patients  with  exacerbation  compared  to  the  baseline  period  was  14.2%. 
Respective proportions decreased during Part II, in particular during the first half (from 19.6% 
during weeks 1-4 to 8.2% during weeks 17-28). The total proportion of patients with a seizure 
reduction  of  at  least  50%  compared  to  the  baseline  period  was  46.6%;  it  was  44.9%  during 
the  first  interval,  48.0%  during  the  second  interval  and  at  least  54.8%  during  each  of  the 
subsequent intervals. 
−  Seizure  severity:  small  mean  increases  in  the  total  score  of  the  Hague  seizure  severity  scale 
were seen during Part II. 
−  The  median  standardised  number  of  days  with  seizures  was  4.8  days  overall;  it  continuously 
decreased over the course of Part II, from 5.0 days during the first to 2.9 days during the last 
time interval. 
Of the 260 patients enrolled into Part II, 183 (70.4%) completed Part II and 152 (58.5%) chose to 
continue treatment in Part III of study 305. 
The  CHMP  noted  that,  taking  into  consideration  the  open-label  character  and  the  drop-out  rate  of 
approximately 30% of part II together with the results of part I of study 305, no robust conclusions of 
efficacy of ELS in the evaluated population can be drawn from the this study part (II) of study 305.

Safety results 
Part I  
The  safety  results  did  not  reveal  any  new  findings  of  concern,  compared  to  prior  studies.  The  main 
safety results were as follows:  
−  A total of 112 patients (83.6%) in the ESL group compared to 94 (72.9%) in the placebo group 
experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  (Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Event).  Most  frequently  reported 
TEAEs (>5% of patients in any treatment group) were headache (18 patients [13.4%] ESL, 8 
patients [6.2%] placebo), nasopharyngitis (15 [11.2%] ESL, 15 [11.6%] placebo), somnolence 
(15  [11.2%]  ESL,  6  [4.7%]  placebo),  convulsion  (13  [9.7%]  ESL,  14  [10.9%]  placebo), 
pyrexia  (10  [7.5%]  ESL,  7  [5.4%]  placebo),  pharyngitis  (9  [6.7%]  ESL,  9  [7.0%]  placebo), 
vomiting  (8  [6.0%]  ESL,  8  [6.2%]  placebo),  diplopia  (8  [6.0%]  ESL,  2  [1.6%]  placebo), 
respiratory tract infection (7 [5.2%] ESL, 7 [5.4%] placebo), nausea (7 [5.2%] ESL, 1 [0.8%] 
placebo),  bronchitis  (5  [3.7%]  ESL,  7  [5.4%]  placebo),  and  rhinitis  (4  [3.0%]  ESL,  7  [5.4%] 
placebo).  A  higher  number  of  patients  treated  with  ESL  compared  to  placebo  (>2%  absolute 
difference)  reported  headache,  somnolence,  pyrexia,  diplopia,  nausea,  decreased  appetite, 
vertigo, agitation, dizziness, increased weight, upper abdominal pain, influenza, and asthma.  
−  A  total  of  56  ESL  patients  (41.8%)  compared  to  32  placebo  patients  (24.8%)  had  at  least  1 
possibly related TEAE. Most commonly reported possibly related TEAEs (≥5% of patients in the 
ESL group) were somnolence (12 patients [9.0%] ESL, 5 patients [3.9%] placebo), convulsion 
(7 [5.2%] ESL, 6 [4.7%] placebo), and diplopia (7 [5.2%] ESL, 2 [1.6%] placebo).  
−  A  total  of  15  ESL  patients  (11.2%)  compared  to  9  placebo  patients  (7.0%)  had  at  least  1 
serious TEAE. The only serious TEAEs reported by more than 1 patient in any treatment group 
were  status  epilepticus  (3  patients  [2.2%]  ESL,  0  placebo),  convulsion  (2  [1.5%]  ESL,  2 
[1.6%] placebo), bronchopneumonia (2 [1.5%] ESL, 0 placebo), device malfunction (2 [1.5%] 
ESL, 0 placebo), and pneumonia (1 [0.7%] ESL, 3 [2.3%] placebo).  
The  CHMP  noted  that  of  the  3  status  epilepticus  cases  in  the  ESL  group,  2  occurred  during  the 
tapering-off period and during the follow up period (i.e. after withdrawal of ESL), respectively.

In  this  context  it  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  reassuring,  that  exacerbation  in  seizure  frequency 
compared  to  baseline  occurred  in  a  lower  percentage  in  ELS  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients 
during  titration  as  well  as  during  maintenance  period  (≥100%  exacerbation  during  titration  period  in 
2.2% ELS vs. 8.5% placebo treated, during maintenance period in 2.3% ELS vs. 6.5% placebo treated 
patients; ≥25% exacerbation during titration period in 11.2%  ELS vs. 14.7% placebo treated, during 
maintenance period in 13.3% ELS vs. 13.7% placebo treated patients).  
Furthermore, responder rates by seizure type showed slightly higher responder rates in the ESL group 
compared  to  the  placebo  group  with  respect  to  partial  evolving  to  secondary  generalized  seizures, 
however overall frequencies for these seizure type was generally low.  
−  A total of 5 patients (3 [2.2%] ESL, 2 [1.6%] placebo) had at least 1 possibly related serious 
TEAE. These events were vertigo, drug withdrawal syndrome, status epilepticus, and vascular 
purpura in the ESL group, and irritability, convulsion, and hypotonia in the placebo group.  
The CHMP noted that according to the SAE narratives of part I of the study, one further patient had at 
least  1  possibly  related  serious  TEAE  (No.  #13506):  Exanthema  (PT  rash)  was  considered  to  be 
probably related to treatment with ESL.  
In  the  case  of  “vascular  purpura”  the  patient  developed  a  skin  rash  with  “concomitantly  spotty-
petechial elements fully disappearing with pressing”. The rash occurred without subjective complaints 
(pruritus,  burn  or  pain),  without  subjective  repercussion,  and  without  thrombocytopenia,  eosinophilia 
or pathological liver function tests and was reversible after discontinuation of ESL.    
Rash (common) and hypersensitivity (uncommon) are already labeled adverse reactions of Zebinix in 
the approved adult indication.   
The  status  epilepticus  and  “withdrawal  phenomenon”  (PT  drug  withdrawal  syndrome)  occurred  in  a 
study patient 2 days after final ESL discontinuation in the observational follow-up period. 
−  Study treatment was discontinued due to a TEAE for 7 patients (5.2%) in the ESL group and 3 
(2.3%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  only  TEAE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  reported 
more than once overall was convulsion (1 patient [0.7%] ESL, 3 [2.3%] placebo).  
−  Two  patients  died  due  to  an  AE  (Adverse  Event)  during  Part  I:  a  6-year-old  female  patient 
treated with ESL, due to convulsion, brain oedema, bronchopneumonia, and brain herniation, 
and  a  5-year-old  female  patient  treated  with  placebo  due  to  asphyxia.  The  events  were 
considered unrelated or unlikely related to study medication.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  in  the  death  case  which  occurred  in  the  ESL  treatment  group,  cluster  seizures 
were  considered  to  be  the  primary  event  leading  to  death.  The  event  occurred  in  a  in  a  7  year  old 
patient (height 108 cm, weight 20 kg) with a meningomyelocele with hydrocephalus, controlled by a V-
P  shunt,  who  had  a  long  standing  history  of  very  frequent  seizures  before  study  entry  (about  60  per 
months) and who was receiving 3 concomitant AEDs during the study (i.e. vigabatrine, lamotrigine and 
phenobarbital)  allowed  as  waiver  of  the  respective  inclusion  criterium.  As  treatment  for  the  cluster 
seizures, the patient additionally received 20 mg diazepam rectally.  
The  event  was  considered  unrelated  by  the  investigator  whereas  the  sponsor  concluded  that  the 
underlying  disease  as  well  as  the  rather  high  dose  of  diazepam  (in  addition  to  concomitant 
phenobarbital)  may  have  contributed  to  the  cluster  seizures  and  subsequent  apnoea,  respectively

however that it is not possible to completely rule out a contributory role of ESL to the cluster seizures, 
which is agreed by the assessor.   
−  During  the  tapering-off  or  follow-up  period,  16  patients  (12.4%)  in  the  ESL  group  and 
10 patients (7.9%) in the placebo group had at least 1 neurological TEAE.  
−  Changes from a normal laboratory value at baseline to an abnormal value at endpoint occurred 
in fewer than 25% of patients per laboratory parameter and treatment group and with mostly 
similar  frequency  between  treatment  groups.  For  any  laboratory  parameter,  no  more  than  2 
patients  per  treatment  group  had  a  laboratory  value  considered  clinically  significant  by  the 
investigator,  with  the  exception  of  gamma-glutamyltransferase  (GGT)  that  was  clinically 
significant for 3 patients (2.3%) in the ESL group compared to none in the placebo group. In 
addition, 4 patients (3.0%) in the ESL group and 1 patient (0.8%) in the placebo group had a 
decrease  from  baseline  in  sodium  levels  of  ≥10  mmol/L.  Twelve  patients  (9.0%)  in  the  ESL 
group  and  3  patients  (2.3%)  in  the  placebo  group  had  post-baseline  sodium  values  ≤135 
mmol/L (8 patients [6.0%] in the ESL group compared with 3 patients [2.3%] in the placebo 
group had a sodium value of >130-135 mmol/L). 
The CHMP noted that liver disorder was a known adverse drug reaction of Zebinix (uncommon).  
A  decrease  from  baseline  in  sodium  levels  and  low  post-baseline  sodium  values,  respectively  were 
found  in  a  higher  percentage  in  active  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients,  however,  no  ADR  of 
hyponatraemia  was  reported  as  ADR  in  study  305  (part  I  or  part  II).  Hyponatraemia  is  already  a 
known  AE  for  Zebinix  in  the  approved  adult  indication,  and  as  such  reflected  in  the  product 
information. 
−  No  clinically  relevant  findings  were  seen  in  the  analysis  of  vital  signs,  height,  weight,  body 
mass index (BMI), head circumference, sexual maturation assessment, and ECG.  
−  The safety profile in the subgroup of patients in strata II and III was similar to that seen in the 
overall safety set.  
Part II  
Safety results during Part II did not reveal any findings of concern with regard to the long-term safety 
of ESL in the included population. Frequencies for AE categories were generally similar between groups 
by  previous  treatment  with  the  exception  of  the  period  of  the  first  4  weeks  of  Part  II  where  more 
patients previously treated with placebo had TEAEs considered at least possibly related. This is also not 
a finding of concern as the reported TEAEs were central nervous system related (somnolence, diplopia, 
and  ataxia)  and  it  is  known  that  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  increase  with  the  start  of  ESL  or  the 
increase of ESL doses.  
The main safety results during Part II in all patients treated with ESL were as follows: 
−  191  patients  (73.5%)  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE.  Most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were 
convulsion  (39  patients  [15.0%]),  nasopharyngitis  (33  [12.7]),  somnolence  (24  [9.2%]), 
vomiting (24 [9.2%]), headache (23 [8.8%]), and pyrexia (22 [8.5%]).  
−  86 patients (33.1%) had  at least 1 TEAE that was considered at least possibly related to ESL 
by the investigator. Most commonly reported such TEAEs (≥5% of patients) were somnolence 
(22 patients [8.5%]) and convulsion (15 [5.8%]).

−  27  patients  (10.4%)  had  at  least  1  serious  TEAE;  the  only  serious  TEAEs  reported  by  more 
than 2 patients were convulsion (6 patients [2.3%]) and pneumonia (4 [1.5%]).  
−  14  patients  (5.4%)  had  at  least  1  TEAE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation;  the  only  such 
TEAEs  reported  more  than  once  were  convulsion  (7  patients  [2.7%]),  abnormal  behaviour  (2 
[0.8%]), and hypotonia (2 [0.8%]).  
−  No cases of death were reported during Part II.  
−  Changes  from  a  normal  laboratory  value  at  baseline  (OL)  to  an  abnormal  value  at  endpoint 
occurred  in  fewer  than  30.1%  of  patients  per  laboratory  parameter.  For  any  laboratory 
parameter, no more than 3 patients had a laboratory value considered clinically significant by 
the  investigator,  with  the  exception  of  GGT  that  was  clinically  significant  for  13  patients 
(5.8%), and free thyroxine (T4) that was clinically significant for 5 patients (2.2%).  
−  No clinically relevant findings were seen in the analysis of vital signs, height, weight, BMI, head 
circumference, sexual maturation assessment, and ECG during Part II. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  adverse  event  profile  of  study  parts  I  and  II  was  generally  consistent 
with  previous  data  on  ESL.  No  new  unique  safety  concerns  occurred  within  this  study.  Update  or 
change of product information is therefore not considered necessary at this point.  
2. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
In part I of study 305 no superior efficacy of ESL over placebo could be shown as adjunctive treatment 
in children with refractory partial onset seizures. The only statistically significant difference in favour of 
ESL  compared  to  placebo  (in  an  analysis  of  the  relative  change  in  standardised  seizure  frequency 
during the titration + maintenance period based on patients in strata II and III) resulted from a post-
hoc  analysis.  These  results  appear  contradictory  to  the  results  of  study  208,  submitted  in  a  previous 
procedure for Zebinix, in which ESL as adjunctive treatment was statistically significantly different from 
placebo with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint (improvement in standardized seizure frequency) 
as well as with respect to further efficacy parameters in paediatric patients with partial onset seizures.  
The  adverse  event  profile  derived  from  part  I  and  II  of  study  305  was  generally  consistent  with 
previous data on ESL.  
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH did not propose any amendment of the product information. 
Study 305 did not allow for conclusion of efficacy of ESL as adjunctive treatment in paediatric patients 
with  refractory  partial  onset  seizures  and  the  current  information  given  in  the  product  information  of 
Zebinix,  that  efficacy  of  eslicarbazepine  acetate  in  children  has  not  yet  been  established  was 
considered  by  the  CHMP  further  valid.  However,  the  hitherto  information  that  “no  data  are  available” 
should be deleted with the next possible opportunity.  
No  new  unique  safety  concerns  occurred  within  this  study.  An  update  of  the  product  information 
regarding safety was therefore not considered necessary at the time of this report.

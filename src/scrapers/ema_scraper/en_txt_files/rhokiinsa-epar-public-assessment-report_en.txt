2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Open-angle glaucoma are chronic, progressive optic neuropathies that have in common characteristic 
morphological changes of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer in the absence of other ocular 
disease or congenital anomalies. Progressive retinal ganglion cells death and visual field loss are 
associated with these changes and can eventually lead to blindness (EGS 2014). 
A number of schemes for classifying glaucoma have been proposed based on age, site to obstruction to 
aqueous outflow and aetiology. The most widely used is the separation between open angle and angle 
closure. 
In open angle glaucoma, which is applied for in this application, the anterior chamber angle is open upon 
gonioscopic observation, and frequently there is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). 
Glaucoma is not a homogenous disease which includes a spectrum of optic neuropathies such as: 
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) – optic disc damage and visual field loss associated with elevated 
IOP. 
Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) – optic nerve damage and visual field loss associated with normal IOP. 
NTG is a form of Primary open angle glaucoma. 
Ocular hypertension (OHT) – normal optic disc and visual field associated with elevated IOP 
Secondary open-angle glaucoma – increased resistance to trabecular meshwork outflow associated with 
other condition (pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion syndrom,steroid-induced glaucoma, facolitic, 
infectious, neovascular glaucoma). 
A major risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss is elevated intraocular pressure (The AGIS 
Investigators, 2000). 
Normal IOP has been defined as two standard deviations above normality, i.e. 21 mmHg, and any IOP 
above this level is considered to be elevated.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Primary open angle glaucoma accounts 
for approximately 74% of all glaucoma cases worldwide. In Europe the population prevalence of primary 
open angle glaucoma was estimated to be 2% in the population aged over 40 years in 2015. 
Risk factors include increasing age, family history, elevated intraocular pressure and ethnicity, with 
persons of African origin having a higher risk of developing open angle glaucoma. 
Elevated intraocular pressure is the most important known risk factor for primary open angle glaucoma. 
Studies such as the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (Heijl 2011), the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study 
(Kass 2002, Kass 2010), and the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study (CNTGS Study Group 
1998, Anderson 2003) support the role of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) as the only modifiable risk 
factor for glaucomatous visual field loss.

2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and can 
eventually lead to blindness due to progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting 
changes in the head of the optic nerve. The pathophysiology of open angle glaucoma is not fully 
understood. Multiple genetic factors and the influence of co-morbidities are likely to play a role. Elevated 
intraocular pressure is a major risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss though ocular hypertension is 
not a feature in all cases of glaucoma. 
The intraocular pressure is influenced by the balance between the aqueous humour secreted by the ciliary 
body and drainage through two independent pathways, the trabecular meshwork and the uvoscleral 
outflow pathway. Patients with raised intraocular pressure and open angle glaucoma have increased 
resistance to aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The early stages of the condition are asymptomatic and patients may not realise until they have 
significant visual field loss. The condition is often detected during routine eye examinations on the basis 
of raised intraocular pressure or fundal changes. Visual acuity is unaffected as long as central vision is 
preserved.  
Glaucoma is diagnosed in patients with characteristic nerve damage on fundus examination and visual 
field testing, usually in the presence of elevated intraocular pressure. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The aim of open angle glaucoma treatment is to lower intraocular pressure. There is evidence that 
lowering intraocular pressure in case of intraocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma (even when the 
patient has normal intraocular pressure) can delay progression and reduce the risk of developing visual 
field loss or delay exacerbation of visual field loss. IOP lowering therapy can be pharmacological (mainly 
topical) or surgical (including laser therapy). First line therapy is usually a topical product e.g. 
prostaglandins, beta blockers and less frequently alpha adrenergic agonists. Topical prostaglandins are 
more frequently used in Europe as initial therapy, in particular latanoprost. 
About the product 
Netarsudil  is  a  potent  Rho  kinase  inhibitor  and  a  norepinephrine  transporter  inhibitor.  Both  of  these 
biochemical activities likely contribute to the multiple mechanisms by which topical netarsudil influences 
aqueous  humour  dynamics  and  lowers  IOP.  The  main  effect  on  IOP  appears  to  be  due  to  increased 
aqueous outflow. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant has submitted a number of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and efficacy and safety 
studies to support the application. Two studies allowed for the recruitment of children aged under two. Of 
these one recruited only 2 children and the other none. 
The five efficacy and safety studies and one stand-alone safety study were conducted in North America 
mainly in the US in patients with a diagnosis of ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma between 
2012 and 2016. Almost 1,400 patients with intraocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma have been 
exposed to netarsudil in efficacy and safety studies submitted to support this application. The majority of 
participants  were  female  (at  least  60%  across  all  of  the  studies).  Most  participants  were  White 
Assessment report

approximately 75% with approximately 22% Black or African American and under 2% Asian. The median 
age of study participants ranged for 62 to 69 years. (See first Table in the Efficacy section for further 
detail on these studies). 
Since 2015 the applicant has obtained scientific advice from the MPA, the MHRA and the EMA.  The advice 
has  only  focused  specifically  on  this  application  in  a  limited  fashion.  All  of  the  studies  apart  from  the 
pivotal studies had already been concluded prior to seeking scientific advice. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a topical, multidose, sterile aqueous ophthalmic solution containing 
200 micrograms/ml of netarsudil (as mesylate salt) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, mannitol, boric acid, sodium hydroxide (pH-adjustment) 
and water for injections. 
The product is available in opaque white low density polyethylene bottles and tips with white 
polypropylene caps and anti-tamper seals, containing 2.5 ml of solution. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of netarsudil mesylate is {4-[(1S)-2-amino-1-[(isoquinolin-6-yl) 
carbamoyl]ethyl]phenyl} methyl 2,4-dimethylbenzoate, methanesulfonate (1:2). It corresponds to the 
molecular formula C30H35N3O9S2 (dimesilate salt) (C28H27N3O3 (free base)), its relative molecular mass is 
645.74 g/mol (dimesilate salt) (453.53 g/mol (free base)) and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Structure of netarsudil mesylate. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis (EA), 
mass spectrometry (MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) 
and X-ray powder diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffractometric (XRD) analysis was performed to 
confirm the absolute stereochemistry. 
Netarsudil mesylate appears as a light yellow to white moderately hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is 
freely soluble in water and soluble in methanol. Its partition coefficient (LogP) was determined to be 4.44 
and two pKa values were determined to be pKa1: 5.43 and pKa2: 7.91. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019  
Page 11/122

It has a single stereocenter and is produced selectively as a single enantiomer of the (S)-configuration. 
The absolute stereochemistry was established from single-crystal X-ray analysis of the penultimate 
intermediate. 
Netarsudil mesylate exhibits polymorphism. Two polymorphs of the drug substance have been identified 
by X-ray powder diffraction – A and B. The final isolated product of the manufacturing process is a mixture 
of the identified forms A and B. Stability of the two forms has been studied with no significant difference 
seen between them. Furthermore, no difference was seen in the processing characteristics. However, due 
to the type of the finished product formulation (solution), the physical form of the active substance has 
not been classified as critical. 
Based on the information provided by the applicant, netarsudil is considered to be a New Active Substance 
(NAS). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in six steps from three starting materials. One of the starting material 
(SM) was redefined as requested by the CHMP and the revised process is now described in the dossier. As 
a result the supplier of the redefined SM is included in the dossier together with batch analysis data have 
been presented and demonstrated compliance of the active substance with the specification. Updated 
stability data are available and also met specification limits. The redefined starting material has been 
adequately justified. Purging of impurities has been demonstrated. The quality of the obtained netarsudil 
was equivalent to netarsudil manufactured using the originally applied route of synthesis. All other 
proposed starting materials have been justified, along with their specifications, and are considered 
acceptable. 
Acceptable specifications analytical methods and batch information were provided for the control of the 
intermediates. The optimization of the manufacturing process during development has been described in 
sufficient detail. Critical steps were identified and a suitable control strategy has been defined. Critical and 
key process parameters have been identified for each manufacturing step and normal operating ranges 
(NORs) proposed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. The selection of the dimesylate salt form has been justified sufficiently 
based on solubility considerations and assessment of the risk of formation of alkyl methanesulfonate 
impurities during the active substance manufacturing process and on storage. The control limit for the 
three methanesulfonates (methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) is well below the ICH M7 accepted TTC of 1.5 μg/day 
and well below the published PDEs of the individual methanesulfonate esters (PDEmethyl = 75 μg/day; 
PDEethyl = 125 μg/day; PDEiPr = 2.5 μg/day). 
The packaging material of netarsudil mesylate has been clearly described and the suppliers and the 
specifications have been listed in the dossier. The packaging material comply with the relevant 
requirements of Ph. Eur. and with the applicable with EU Regulation No. 10/2011 as amended, and EU 
Regulation No. 202/2014. 
Specification 
Netarsudil mesylate active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), chiral impurity 
((R)-enantiomer - chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
methanesulfonates (GC), residual solvents (HS-GC), methanesulfonic acid content (IC), water content 
(KF), and microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.).

The mesylate salt content of netarsudil (counter-ion) is determined from the assay for methanesulfonic 
acid using ICP. Methanesulfonates are controlled with limit, which is consistent with obtained results and 
complies with ICH M7. 
Considering the route of synthesis, the risk for class 1 solvents to be present in the active substance is 
deemed to be insignificant, and therefore the inclusion of tests for Class 1 solvents in the specification is 
not considered necessary. Furthermore the risk assessment was supported by batch analysis data that 
showed no Class 1 solvents detected in three batches of the active substance with detection limits at or 
below 44% of the ICH limits. This could be accepted in view of the low dose of the finished product. 
Limits for elemental impurities meet the requirements of ICH Q3D permitted daily intakes (PDEs). The 
elemental impurities lithium, used in the manufacture of netarsudil mesylate, and palladium, used in the 
manufacture of one of the starting materials, are also specified. To date, none of the elemental impurities 
have been observed above the specification limits.  
 The justification for not including certain parameters in the active substance specification is considered 
acceptable and was based on batch results. The analytical methods used have been adequately described 
and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Full batch analysis data has been provided for 8 batches of drug substance. All batches fulfilled the 
proposed specifications. Additionally, batch data for 7 early development batches analysed according to 
specifications in effect at the time of testing have been included. The batch data provided is considered to 
be sufficient. Consistency and uniformity of the active substance quality have been demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale and three pilot scale batches of active substance stored in the 
intended commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term conditions (-20 ºC ±5 ºC), and for 
up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (5 °C ± 3 °C) was provided according to the ICH guidelines. 
Supportive data from two further pilot batches for up to 48 months under long-term conditions (-20°C 
±5°C) and 12 months under accelerated conditions (5°C±3°C) was also provided. All batches of drug 
substance were manufactured using the commercial synthetic route at the proposed site.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, chromatographic purity, water content, chiral purity (not 
tested for one of supportive batches), methanesulfonates (not tested for both supportive batches), 
microbial bioburden (not tested for both supportive batches. No significant changes were observed to any 
of the measured parameters in any of the tested batches. All samples met the specifications 
demonstrating the chemical stability of netarsudil mesylate. 
In order to evaluate any potential impact on the stability profile of netarsudil mesylate due to the change 
in starting material supplier, data from two pilot scale batches of netarsudil mesylate manufactured using 
the redefined starting material supplied by the new supplier was presented. Three months’ stability data 
was available also indicating that these two batches also meet the specification. The active substance 
manufacturer commits to provide updated stability data as the stability study proceeds as per the 
submitted stability protocol. 
Stress studies were performed for the two supportive batches and one pilot batch at 25 °C ± 2 °C/60  
±5% RH for a period of 12, 6 and 3 months, respectively. After 6 months’ storage, an increase in water 
content was observed. After 12 months’ storage, significant growth in impurities was detected. The 
obtained results confirm the hygroscopic nature of the active substance and demonstrate that the active 
substance stability is maintained for an excursion period of up to 3 months only under the stressed 
conditions.

Freeze/Thaw studies 
Samples of netarsudil mesylate were subjected to 5 freeze/thaw cycles between -20°C ± 5°C and 
controlled room temperature simulating the use of the material over time. Likewise, the desiccant and 
secondary packaging were replaced after each cycle. For all the tested parameters specifications were 
met.  
Photostability 
Photostability of netarsudil mesylate was studied on a pilot batch as per ICH Photostability Option 2 
conditions in a clear glass bottle, an amber bottle, and an amber bottle wrapped in foil (control). For all 
the tested parameters specifications were met. The suitability of the proposed container was 
demonstrated.  
Based on the provided data, the proposed retest period of 36 months for the active substance when 
stored at -20 °C protected from light and moisture, is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Rhokiinsa 200 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution is a clear, sterile, isotonic solution at approximately 
pH 5; it is multi-dose product and is preserved with benzalkonium chloride.  
The composition of the finished product includes netarsudil along with the following excipients: mannitol, 
boric acid, benzalkonium chloride, sodium hydroxide and water for injections.        
The finished product is designed as a multi-dose product for ophthalmic application and is intended to 
conform to the characteristics for topical ophthalmic solutions: clarity, pH, tonicity and the need for 
adequate preservation were of prime consideration in the selection of the formula composition. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) has been presented. The finished product Critical Quality 
Attributes (CQAs) have been presented and appropriately justified. The CQAs formed the basis for the 
specifications for the finished product. 
The excipients used (boric acid, mannitol, benzalkonium chloride and sodium hydroxide) are compendial 
and their concentrations are consistent with those contained in other approved ophthalmic products in the 
EU. 
The buffering agent used is boric acid which is present at a relatively low level. The use of boric acid in 
ophthalmic products is well established as detailed in EMA’s Questions and answers on boric acid and 
borates used as excipients in medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/619104/2013). For ocular 
comfort, the product is isotonic with its tonicity adjusted using mannitol. 
This multi-dose product is preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK). The level of BAK used in this 
formulation is within the range of other topical ophthalmic products approved in the EU. The use of BAK 
in topical ophthalmic products at a similar concentration is well established as detailed in EMA’s Questions 
and answers on benzalkonium chloride used as an excipient in medicinal products for human use 
(EMA/CHMP/495737/2013). Studies were performed to evaluate the ability of various preserved 
formulations of netarsudil to inhibit the growth of common microbes and conform to the Ph. Eur. 
antimicrobial effectiveness criteria for ophthalmic products demonstrating that the selected concentration 
of the preservative is appropriate for use in this formulation. In order to optimise the benefit-risk profile 
in the proposed indication, especially in the context of long term treatment of OAG/OHT, upon the request 
of the CHMP, the applicant confirmed that is actively exploring re-formulation of the product and relevant 
proposals for a revised bridging study have been submitted. The CHMP considers that since the current 
formulation fulfils the quality requirements necessary to maintain microbiological quality, the proposed 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019  
Page 14/122 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
concentration of the BAK preservative is acceptable, based on the established safety and efficacy profile. 
Overall, the information regarding the preservative system is deemed sufficient. 
Sodium hydroxide is used to adjust the pH of the final formulation. Water for Injection is used throughout 
the manufacturing process for the dissolution of excipients and adjustment of the product formulation to 
its final batch size. No novel excipients are used. 
Early prototype formulations were routinely tested for ocular hypotensive efficacy and ocular irritation in 
rabbits to ensure compatibility between the excipients and the active substance. No compatibility issues 
have been observed between netarsudil mesylate, the selected excipients and the container closure 
system during development and stability. 
Various strengths of netarsudil ophthalmic solution were evaluated throughout development, ranging in 
netarsudil concentration from 0.01 to 0.12%. A 0.02% concentration of netarsudil was selected as the 
definitive strength for Phase 3 clinical studies and commercialization. With the exception of the 
concentration of the active substance, all excipients remained the same and in comparable relative 
proportions though an overage of BAK was not applied at all stages.  
During manufacturing process development, a process that meets the functional requirements of the 
formulation and the ophthalmic dosage form was selected. Ingredients are added in a specific sequential 
order to Water for Injections with mixing to ensure complete dissolution and a homogenous solution. A 
risk assessment was performed to determine the impact of key manufacturing process variables (i.e., raw 
material attributes, process parameters for the major manufacturing steps) on the quality attributes of 
the finished product. The conclusions of the risk assessment were confirmed through the process 
validation studies.  
The sterilization method of the drug product solution is sterile filtration, followed by aseptic filling and was 
sufficiently justified based on the physicochemical properties of the active substance and the container 
closure system. The choice of sterilization method of container components has been justified considering 
the nature of the materials and the effect of other means of sterilisation (e.g. gamma radiation).  
The site of manufacture of the pivotal Phase 3 clinical batches, registration stability batches, and 
commercial scale batches is the same as the proposed manufacturer. 
The finished product is packaged in white, multi-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bottle fitted with 
linear low-density polyethylene dropper tip (LLDPE) and white polypropylene (PP) screw cap. The 
container-closure system is one which is routinely used for administration of multi-dose ophthalmic 
solutions as drops. Compliance of the packaging materials with relevant compendial monographs or 
directives has been stated. Product-specific leachables studies have demonstrated acceptable levels of 
leachables with this container closure system, when in contact with the product formulation. 
A dose delivery performance study was conducted and the results demonstrate that Rhokiinsa can be 
reproducibly dosed with the selected container closure system. 
Patient experience and suitability of the proposed commercial container closure was studied through use 
in two Phase 3 clinical trials. The age of the patients reflected the age range of the target population 
proposed for this product. There were no reported complaints about the usability of the product or 
container closure system. This indicates that the type, size, shape, and usability of the selected container 
closure system is adequate and provides evidence that the expected patient population for the product 
can effectively and reproducibly self-administer the eye drops according to the recommended instructions 
for administration. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of dissolving the excipients and the active substance 
in water for injections. Following compounding of the formulation, sterile filtration of the bulk solution and  
aseptic filling into to a pre-sterilized container closure system takes place. The manufacturing process 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019  
Page 15/122 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
involves aseptic processing with filtration as the method of sterilization and is classified as non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
The critical steps have been defined and appropriate in process controls have been presented and are in 
place. Hold times have been established and clearly stated.  
Process validation has been completed on six commercial scale batches of the finished product to confirm 
the ability of the manufacturing process to meet the in-process and finished product specifications. During 
validation the essential/critical steps were verified. The sterility assurance of the manufacturing process 
has been demonstrated through completion of media fills and is verified semi-annually through the 
on-going media fill program. Sterilization processes are validated for each designated piece of equipment. 
These sterilization processes are qualified on an annual basis. Sufficient details on the sterilisation of the 
container and on validation were presented.  Process validation data suggest that the process is 
adequately controlled, reproducible and robust, and yields a product that complies with the specifications. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), description of container (visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), identification of 
active substance (UV, HPLC), identification of BAK (HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
chiral impurity (chiral HPLC), BAK content (HPLC), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and 
efficacy of antimicrobial preservation (Ph. Eur.). 
The limits for any impurity exceeding the threshold for identification and qualification, according to ICH 
Guideline Q3B(R2) has been qualified in non-clinical studies. Additional known degradation products were 
also qualified via long term ocular toxicity studies using product formulations lots intentionally spiked with 
each impurity. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product in line with the new ICH Q3D 
Guideline for Elemental Impurities has been assessed using a risk-based approach.  In general, the oral 
route limits were applied, since the oral route of exposure was considered the most relevant for topically 
administered ocular drugs with regards to systemic exposure. A literature search was performed to 
identify any toxicity information relevant to the topical ocular route of administration. For any evidence of 
local effects, the literature limits were compared to the ICH PDE. If a difference was observed, correction 
factors were applied when relevant exposure data were available. No specific risks in relation to the ocular 
administration were identified for Class 1 elements. For Class 2 and 3 elements the limits are considered 
acceptable and the performed risk assessment demonstrated the risk of elemental impurity introduction 
from the raw materials, container closure system and manufacturing process is very low and no further 
controls are warranted in the specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data was provided for 17 commercial scale batches from the proposed manufacturer and 
for twelve smaller batches from development sites used in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The data 
demonstrate that all parameters are well within their specifications and therefore indicate consistent 
manufacture of the finished product. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of finished product stored in inverted and upright positions 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions at 5 °C ± 3 °C and for six months under accelerated 
conditions at 25 °C ± 2°C/40% ± 5% RH and 30 °C ± 2 °C / 65% ± 5% RH according to the ICH 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

guidelines have been presented. The six commercial scale batches were manufactured and filled into the 
proposed container closure system. 
Data from supportive stability studies for eight pilot and full scale batches having fill volumes ranging 
from 1 mL to 5 mL stored at 5 °C ± 3 °C and 25 °C ± 2 °C / 40% RH±5% RH conditions and 30 °C ± 2 
°C / 65% RH ± 5% RH were also provided.  
All batches were manufactured and packaged at the proposed commercial manufacturing and packaging 
site and evaluated in both upright and inverted position.  
The following attributes were assessed: description, pH, osmolality, assay and degradation products, 
chiral impurity, benzalkonium chloride (preservative content), particulate matter, sterility, antimicrobial 
effectiveness and additionally for three commercial scale batches, leachables, and weight loss/gain. All 
results in the stability studies comply with the proposed specification. 
Forced degradation studies 
Finished product solution and placebo solution were exposed to predetermined severe acid, base, 
peroxide, heat, and light (UV and white, ICH Option 2), or conditions necessary to target 10-15% 
degradation if lower. Significant degradation occurred under basic, heat, oxidative and light conditions. 
Based upon the results of the forced degradation studies, the analytical methods for assay and 
degradation products are considered to be stability-indicating. 
In-use Stability Studies 
Several studies that simulated use of the product were conducted, according to the Note for Guidance on 
In-use Stability Testing of Human Medicinal Products (CPMP/QWP/2934/99). A total of three different lots 
of finished product were tested for a period of 28-days and 42-days stored at 25°C to simulate use at 
room temperature. At the beginning of the in-use stability study, the product samples had been stored for 
18, 21, 24, or 36 months at 5 °C ± 3 °C. All results met specifications. This indicates that the product is 
stable when used and stored in the multi-dose container at temperatures up to 25 °C. This is reflected in 
section 6.3 of the SmPC where the following recommendation is included: “Opened bottle: 4 weeks after 
first opening the bottle. Do not store above 25 °C” (SmPC 6.3). 
Temperature Excursion Studies and Freeze-Thaw Cycle Study 
Multiple batches of finished product with different fill volumes were evaluated after storage at 30 °C ± 2 
°C/65% ± 5% RH for up to 6 months and 40 °C ± 2 °C / 20% ± 5% RH for up to 1 month. All lots 
conformed to the proposed specifications after 1 month’s storage under both sets of conditions. Unknown 
impurities were observed for different lots of product stored at 30 °C ± 2 °C / 65% ± 5% RH after 2, 3, 
and 6 months but no trends in the data were observed. 
The finished product was evaluated using two different freeze-thaw conditions:   
- #1: Product samples were stored at -20 °C followed by 30 °C / 65% RH on alternate days for 2 weeks. 
- #2: Product samples were evaluated for 3 cycles of 2 days storage at -20 °C followed by 2 days storage 
at 30 °C / 65% RH. For both studies, the product was tested for description, assay and impurities, chiral 
impurity, pH, osmolality and particulate matter. All specifications were met for both freeze-thaw cycle 
studies.  
The results of the freeze-thaw cycle study and the 30 °C ± 2 °C / 65 ± 5% RH stability storage condition 
indicate that the product is robust with regards to temperature fluctuations (excursions from the 
proposed long-term storage condition) that may be encountered during shipping and handling. 
Photostability Study 
A photostability study on the finished product was conducted as per ICH Q1B, Option 2. The samples were 
tested for description, pH, assay and impurities, and chiral impurity. All acceptance criteria for the 
attributes evaluated were met for all samples except for the unprotected exposed sample in the quartz 
tube. The results of this study confirmed that the primary package (white plastic bottle) provides 
sufficient protection from light for the finished product.

Based on the overall stability data, the claimed shelf life of 3 years and storage conditions “Store in a 
refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) until opened” is acceptable (SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4). 
Adventitious agents 
No excipient or materials of animal or human origin are used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The manufacturing process for the finished product is 
non-standard and the required validation data have been provided. This multi-dose product is preserved 
with benzalkonium chloride the proposed formulation fulfils the quality requirements necessary to 
maintain microbiological quality while adequate safety and efficacy profile has been shown from a clinical 
perspective. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are 
controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Several substances are mentioned within non-clinical section. These include the active substance 
netarsudil mesylate (AR-13324), its active metabolite (AR 13503), the R-enantiomer of netarsudil 
mesylate (AR-13323) and the R-enantiomer of the metabolite of netarsudil mesylate (AR-13534). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics  
The potency and selectivity of netarsudil as an inhibitor of two isoforms of Rho kinase ROCK 1 and 2 was 
determined in enzyme inhibition assays with a panel of human protein kinases. Netarsudil (AR-13324) is 
a potent inhibitor of human ROCK 1 and 2 with Ki values of 1.1 and 1.2 nM, respectively.  The metabolite, 
AR-13503, is about 5-fold more potent with Kis of 0.2 nM for both ROCK1 and ROCK2.  In addition, 
netarsudil shows potent inhibition on other structurally or functionally related protein kinases including 
protein kinase N2 (PKN2; Kis 3.0/1.0 nM), protein kinase A (PKA; Kis 5.0/1.0 nM) and protein kinase 
MRCK alpha (MRCKα; Kis 129/7.0 nM). Based on these results, the selectivity of netarsudil and its 
metabolite is questioned. 
Effects on cytoskeletal components were examined in vitro in cultured porcine and human trabecular 
meshwork cells. Netarsudil and its metabolite, AR-13503, disrupted actin stress fibers in porcine 
trabecular meshwork (PTM) cells and focal adhesions in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells, with 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019  
Page 18/122 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
PTM/HTM IC50s of 504 nM/219 nM and 102 nM/64 nM, respectively. AR-13503 had approximately 4- to 
5-fold greater activity than netarsudil in both assays.  
The active metabolite AR 13503 was evaluated for its effects on trabecular outflow facility and tissue 
morphology in perfused human eye anterior segments. AR 13503 at 0.3 µM (92 ng/ml) caused significant 
increases in outflow facility compared to control eyes from 30 minutes through 3 hours post-treatment. 
Fluorescent imaging and histological analysis showed that AR 13503 increased the area of actively 
filtering tissue in the trabecular outflow pathway, expanded the trabecular meshwork tissue and caused 
dilation of episcleral veins. 
The primary pharmacologic effect of netarsudil mesylate is lowering of IOP. A series of in vivo studies 
were performed in normotensive pigmented rabbits and monkeys to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and 
preliminary tolerability of netarsudil (clinical formulation) at various concentrations. These studies were 
typically performed over 3-4 or 10 days and compared treated eyes to fellow untreated eyes for ocular 
tolerability (based upon Draize scoring) and IOP response. In a 3-day rabbit study, IOP was measured 
following administration of AR-13324 to one eye at 0.005% (1.5 µg/eye), 0.01% (3 µg/eye), 0.02% (6 
µg/eye) and 0.04% (12 µg/eye, clinical formulation). All four concentrations produced significant and 
dose-related reductions in IOP as compared to the contralateral control eye at all time points throughout 
the study and displayed progressively larger reductions over 3 days of dosing. Maximal IOP reductions of 
2.5±0.2 mmHg, 4.6±0.2 mmHg, 5.0±0.6 mmHg, and 8.1±0.7 mmHg were observed at 0.005%, 0.01%, 
0.02% and 0.04%, respectively. In a 10-day rabbit study, IOP was measured following administration of 
AR-13324 to one eye at 0.02% (6 µg/eye) and 0.04% (12 µg/eye, clinical formulation). Maximum IOP 
reductions of 7.0 mmHg and 7.1 mmHg, respectively, were observed at 4 hours post dose on Day 3. In a 
3-day study in Formosan Rock monkeys, IOP was measured following administration of AR-13324 to one 
eye at 0.01% (3 µg/eye), 0.02% (6 µg/eye) and 0.04% (12 µg/eye, clinical formulation). All three 
concentrations produced significant and dose-related reductions in IOP as compared to the contralateral 
control eye at all time points throughout the study. Maximal IOP reductions of 4.2±0.2 mmHg, 5.8±0.3 
mmHg, and 7.5±1.1 mmHg were observed at 0.01%, 0.02% and 0.04%, respectively. 
These studies indicated that netarsudil provided a durable, dose-responsive decrease in IOP when 
delivered once daily and that the IOP response at the end of dosing was typically greater than on the first 
day. Trace to mild hyperaemia (Draize score +0.5 to +1) was a typical ocular finding in most studies, 
which decreased over time with continued dosing. Hyperaemia is also reported as a common adverse 
reaction in clinical trials and is likely caused by smooth muscle cell relaxation causing local vasodilation. 
Additional studies were performed to evaluate other components of the formulation. One 3-day study in 
rabbits examined the ocular hypotensive efficacy and tolerability of four formulations with varying pH and 
varying concentrations of BAK. There was no apparent pH-dependent effect on efficacy. The data suggest 
that increasing the BAK concentration from 0.0075% to 0.015% might yield a slight improvement in 
efficacy, without significantly reducing apparent tolerability. 
Additional mechanism of action studies indicates that netarsudil may lower IOP through multiple 
mechanisms of action. A study in cynomolgus monkeys indicate that netarsudil lowers IOP by increasing 
aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork and decreasing the production of aqueous 
humor. The monkeys were treated for one day with two drops of 0.04% netarsudil (20µg/eye, clinical 
formulation) into one eye and mean IOP was reduced by ~25%, mean outflow facility was increased by 
~53% and mean aqueous flow rate was reduced by ~20%, when compared to contralateral eye, or 
baseline. Further, a study in rabbits showed that netarsudil can reduce the episcleral venous pressure, an 
additional mechanism of action expected to contribute to the lowering of IOP. The rabbits were treated for 
three days with one drop of 0.04% netarsudil (12 µg/eye, clinical formulation) into one eye and mean IOP 
was reduced by ~39% and the episcleral venous pressure was decreased by ~35%, when compared to 
contralateral eye. These results are in agreement with findings in human eyes (see above).

Overall, the applicant proposes that netarsudil treatment lowers IOP by two main mechanisms; increasing 
aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork (outflow facility and lowering of episcleral 
venous pressure. Based on the available data, the proposed mechanisms seem plausible. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics  
Netarsudil was assessed for its off-target activity on 442 human protein kinases, including ROCK 1 and 2. 
At 500 nM (227 ng/mL), significant inhibition (<35% activity) was found on 24 human protein kinases in 
addition to ROCK 1 and 2. The active metabolite was not included in the off-target screen, but AR-13084, 
the metabolite of the racemate AR-13165 was examined. As AR-13084 is also a racemate composed of 
50% of the active metabolite AR-13503, the testing strategy is considered acceptable. At 500 nM, 
AR-13084 showed significant inhibition on 17 human protein kinases in addition to ROCK 1 and 2. IC50 
values were not further identified for any of the off-targets of netarsudil or AR-13084. 
Furthermore, netarsudil and AR-13084 were assessed for its off-target activity on 39 G-protein coupled 
receptors (GPCRs), 4 nuclear hormone receptors, 15 ion channels/transporters and 7 targets of other 
classes. For netarsudil, an activity of >50% inhibition was found on 14 GPCRs, 7 ion 
channels/transporters, and 5 cytochrome P450s. One of the identified off-targets, the hERG potassium 
channel is further discussed below. Another target was the norepinephrine transporter (NET). In 
follow-up NET competitive binding assays, AR-13165 (racemate) was a competitive inhibitor of nisoxetine 
binding to NET with a Ki of 400 nM, whereas AR-13084 did not demonstrate inhibitory activity. Netarsudil 
was not tested in this assay. In a cell-based assay measuring uptake of fluorophore-labeled biogenic 
amine, none of the compounds (netarsudil, AR-13165 and AR-13084) showed significant inhibitory 
activity.  
Based on the available data, it can be concluded that netarsudil and its metabolite are not selective 
inhibitors of Rho kinases. However, as the expression of the potential off-targets in ocular tissues is not 
known, it cannot be concluded if off-target interactions contribute to the observed local safety profile. 
Based on the off-target screen results, the selectivity of netarsudil and its metabolite is questioned. 
Netarsudil, but not the active metabolite AR-13503, was shown to induce phospholipidosis in CHO-K1 
cells with an EC50 of 1.1 µM (~500 ng/mL). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that netarsudil 
also induced the formation of lamellar bodies, confirming that the fluorescent phospholipid accumulation 
in netarsudil treated cells was due to phospholipidosis. 
Safety pharmacology 
Netarsudil was evaluated in dedicated CV safety pharmacology studies, and a functional observational 
battery to evaluate potential CNS effects was included in a 7-day rat iv study. 
No CNS effects were observed after a single or 7 days repeated iv administration of netarsudil up to doses 
of 7.0 mg/kg/day. There were also no signs of CNS effects in repeat-dose studies with netarsudil following 
iv and topical ocular administration. 
In the hERG potassium channel assay, netarsudil caused a dose-dependent inhibition with a measured 
IC50 of 0.4 μM (~181 ng/mL).  The active metabolite was tested in the GLP hERG assay. However, 
AR-13084, the metabolite of the racemate AR-13165 (comprising of 50% AR-13503) was examined in the 
off-target screen of non-kinase proteins (including hERG), and showed no hERG inhibition at 10 µM. 
In a dog safety pharmacology study (telemetry), QTc prolongation was not observed following single iv 
doses of AR-13324 up to 17.6 mg/kg (Cmax 872 ng/mL). Doses at or above 8.8 mg/kg produced 
decreased arterial pressure (by maximum 32%) and increased heart rate (by maximum 124%), with 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

clinical signs of vasodilation observed at 17.6 mg/kg. The NOEL for the effects on arterial pressure and 
heart rate was 0.7 mg/kg.  
Cardiovascular parameters, including ECGs, were also evaluated in repeat-dose studies following iv 
administration in dogs. In a single dose iv dog study, marked decreases in arterial blood pressure were 
noted at 42 mg/kg.  At this dose, the average maximal plasma levels of netarsudil were 3980 ng/mL for 
males and 3260 ng/ml for females. NOEL for the effects on arterial pressure and heart rate was 21 mg/kg 
corresponding to mean Cmax values of 2280 ng/ml in males and 1620 ng/ml in females. In a 28-day 
repeat-dose dog study, no cardiovascular effects were observed following iv administration of netarsudil 
at up to 0.53-0.67 mg/kg/day. At this dose, the Day 28 average Cmax of netarsudil was 63.3/51.51 ng/ml 
in males/females and the average Cmax of AR-13503 was 1.51/1.80 ng/ml in males/females. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential for pharmacodynamic drug interaction between netarsudil and latanoprost was evaluated in 
normotensive Formosan Rock monkeys. A 3-day study was performed to evaluate the IOP-lowering 
efficacy of Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%, Xalatan® Ophthalmic Solution 0.005%, and a 
combination of netarsudil and latanoprost (PG324 Ophthalmic Solution) administered QD to one eye. All 
three formulations produced statistically significant reductions in IOP at all post-dose time points. No 
other drug interaction study was conducted. Based on negligible plasma concentrations of netarsudil and 
its metabolite (AR-13503) detected following topical ocular administration in humans, systemic 
pharmacodynamics drug interactions are considered unlikely. No drug interactions were reported in any 
of the clinical studies with netarsudil ophthalmic solution. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Netarsudil (AR-13324), its metabolite (AR 13503), the R-enantiomer of netarsudil mesylate (AR-13323) 
and the R-enantiomer of the metabolite of netarsudil mesylate (AR-13534) were quantified by liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in plasma samples of rat, rabbit, dog and 
monkey.  
Absorption 
No dedicated PK studies were performed, but systemic absorption of netarsudil following intravenous (iv) 
and topical ocular administration was evaluated in toxicokinetics studies performed as part of the 
toxicology studies conducted in rats (iv), dogs (iv), rabbits (ocular) and monkeys (ocular).  
After iv administration in rats and dogs, plasma concentrations of netarsudil declined in a monophasic 
manner. Plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) was dose-dependent and approximately dose proportional to 
slightly greater than dose-proportional for netarsudil relative to administered netarsudil mesylate. As was 
the case for topical ocular administration in rabbits and monkeys, there were no gender differences 
relating to the exposure or elimination of netarsudil in rats or dogs.  
In rabbits and monkeys, BID topical ocular administration of Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solutions up to 0.04% 
in the 6-month rabbit and 9-month monkey studies resulted in no clear evidence of plasma exposure to 
the parent compound (netarsudil), its metabolite (AR-13503), the enantiomeric impurity of netarsudil 
(AR-13323) or its metabolite (AR 13534) at 3 months or at the end of dosing. 
In both rabbits and monkeys, plasma levels of netarsudil, AR-13323 and their respective metabolites 
were almost entirely below the quantitation limit at BID doses of up to 0.06% Netarsudil Ophthalmic

Solution in the 28 day/1-month repeated dose ocular studies. In shorter term studies (7 days), in which 
more concentrated Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solutions were administered up to 4 times daily, systemic 
concentrations of netarsudil and its active metabolite were sometimes observed. 
Plasma concentrations of netarsudil were higher in rabbits per dose than in primates. 
Distribution 
The in vitro distribution studies indicate that netarsudil is highly protein bound in plasma (rat, dog and 
human) across a range of plasma concentrations and that it also binds to melanin. Protein binding in 
rabbit and monkey plasma was not investigated. The netarsudil metabolite AR-13503 binds less 
extensively to plasma proteins. AR-13503 binds melanin with similar affinity as netarsudil. 
The systemic tissue distribution study in pigmented rats demonstrated that the tissues with the highest 
percent recovery of administered radioactivity were liver (~30% at 0.5 hours and ~14% at 4 hours) and 
skin (~8% at 0.5 hours, and ~6% at 4 hours). Elevated radioactivity concentrations were observed in 
melanin-containing tissues, such as the eye uvea, pigmented skin, and meninges. The concentration in 
these tissues did not decline over the study period, which suggested an association of 
14C-netarsudil-derived radioactivity with melanin. This raises potential concerns for local phototoxicity, 
which are further discussed in the toxicology section. 
The results of a tissue distribution study in rabbits following a single ocular dose of radioactively labelled 
netarsudil in both eyes revealed that the rank order of ocular tissue radioactivity concentrations was as 
follows: cornea>conjunctiva>>iris/ciliary body>> retina-choroid-plexus>aqueous humor>vitreous 
humor>lens. Elimination half-life (T1/2,e) values ranged from 12 to 27 hours for most ocular tissues, 
blood, plasma, liver, and kidney.   
No placental transfer studies have been performed. 
Metabolism 
Netarsudil is cleaved by esterases in vitro and in vivo to form the active metabolite, AR 13503. No 
substantial metabolism of netarsudil was observed during in vitro exposure to cynomolgus monkey, 
human, rat or dog plasma. In contrast, netarsudil was rapidly metabolised when incubated with rabbit 
plasma. Metabolism was most rapid in dog corneas, followed by monkey corneas, rabbit corneas, pig 
corneas, and human corneas. When the metabolite AR-13503 was incubated directly with liver 
microsomes (rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human), there was no evidence of further metabolism in any 
species tested. Thus, there do not appear to be multiple metabolites of netarsudil. 
After topical doses of Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% for 1, 3 or 4 days in rabbits, it was shown that 
netarsudil was converted to AR-13503 such that the metabolite was present at higher levels in aqueous 
humor than the parent compound by 4 hours after instillation. 
Overall, the metabolic pathway of netarsudil appears to be common to rats, rabbits, dogs, cynomolgus 
monkeys and humans.  
Excretion 
Excretion of netarsudil was studied in the systemic tissue distribution study in intact pigmented rats and 
in a topical ocular dosing study in Dutch Belted rabbits. 
In the rat systemic distribution study, the primary route of elimination after iv administration was in the 
feces with 75.9% of the administered dose recovered in the feces and 14.4 % of the administered dose 
recovered in the urine. Excretion of radioactivity in feces was rapid; 72.9% of the administered dose was 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019  
Page 22/122 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
eliminated in the initial 48 hours post-dose and only much lower amounts were detected after 72 hours 
post-dose.  
Following a single ocular dose of 14C-netarsudil in both eyes of rabbits, approximately 80 ± 13.3% of the 
dosed radioactivity was recovered in the excreta by 48 hours post-dose. Percent recovery was ~3-fold 
greater from feces than from urine. Approximately 0.11% of radioactivity remained in the liver and 
kidneys and ~0.68% remained in the sum of the ocular tissues by 48 hours post-dose. 
Thus, neither netarsudil nor its metabolite appears to be extensively retained in the body, and they are 
largely excreted in the feces. 
Potential excretion in milk has not been evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
When tested at 10 µM in a secondary pharmacodynamics screen, netarsudil and AR-13165 (a racemic 
mixture of netarsudil and its enantiomer, AR-13323) showed significant inhibitory activity against five 
cytochrome P450s (1A2, 2C19, 2C6, 2D6 and 3A4). AR-13084, the metabolite of AR-13165, exhibited 
inhibitory activity against CYPs 2C19 and 2D6. The metabolite of netarsudil, AR-13503, was not tested in 
the assay but is considered covered by testing of AR-13084. 
Based on the negligible plasma concentrations of netarsudil and its metabolite (AR-13503) detected 
following topical ocular administration, a risk for systemic DDIs is considered unlikely. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of netarsudil has been evaluated both after ocular and systemic exposure. The 
pivotal studies for ocular administration were conducted in rabbits (6 months) and monkeys (9 months), 
and the systemic exposure in rats and dogs (28 days). 
Single-dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies of netarsudil administered i.v. have been performed in rats (1, 3, 45 mg/kg) 
and dogs (10, 30, 60 mg/kg). In rats the highest dose was associated with several clinical observations 
such as local irritation at the injection site, reduced activity, hunched posture, and pink extremities which 
was thought to be a pharmacological effect. In the dog, 30 and 60 mg/kg caused effects such as reduced 
acitivity and eye squinting. The highest dose (60 mg/kg) showed a clinical pathology spectrum indicative 
of an acute anemia (reduced erythrocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit). 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Ocular administration of netarsudil in different concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and-0.08%) and 
frequencies (1, 2 and 4 times daily) was investigated in rabbits (7 days, 28 days, 3 months and 6 months) 
and monkeys (7 days, 35 days and 9 months). The posology in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study was 
one drop in each eye, 0/0.01/0.02/0.04 % twice daily. 
The systemic exposure after topical administration in the eye was very low in both rabbit and monkeys. 
After one drop in each eye of 0.04% netarsudil twice daily it was not possible (with the exception of one 
rabbit at one time point) to detect AR-13324 in the plasma in rabbits treated for 6 months or in monkeys 
treated for 9 months.  
In order to evaluate the effects of netarsudil systemically several studies in rats and dogs were conducted 
where netarsudil was administered intravenously. Pivotal studies consisted of 28 days treatment with 14 
days recovery period with the intended daily doses 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs.

Mortality/Morbidity 
Male dogs were euthanized for humane reasons after 3 days of administration with iv netarsudil at 12.5 
mg/kg (2/3 animals) and 25 mg/kg (3/3 animals). At day 3 of dosing the animals were observed with e.g. 
elevated  body  temperature,  labored  breathing,  and  decreased  to  no  activity.    The  clinical  pathology 
examination of these animals revealed decreased number of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit and 
lymphocytes. The histopathological evaluation revealed granulocytic infiltrations in multiple organs. The 
plasma exposure expressed as AUC0-24h in these animals were at Day 1 3004 and 7021 ng*h/mL (12.5 
and 25 mg/kg). No other mortalities or morbidities were observed in the investigated species (rat, rabbit, 
dog, and monkey). 
Eyes 
Ocular irritation 
In all studies in rabbit and monkey with ocular administration of netarsudil the signs of irritation such as 
redness of the conjunctiva and/or sclera, chemosis, and discharge were observed. The overall incidence 
and  severity  appeared  to  be  dose  related  and  transient  and  decreased  during  the  dosing  phase  and 
resolved  after  the  recovery  phase.  In  the  pivotal  9  months  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  monkeys, 
hyperaemia, chemosis and/or discharge were observed during the first week of dosing. There were no 
signs of ocular irritation after 8 weeks of treatment. Red eyes/sclera was also noted in dogs administered 
netarsudil intravenously, indicating not only irritation but also a pharmacologically induced hyperaemia in 
the eyes.

Cornea 
In the rabbit degeneration/erosion of the cornea was observed with netarsudil concentrations of 0.04% 
and above. In two of the ocular toxicity studies in monkeys observations of hypertrophy/hyperplasia of 
the corneal epithelium were made. After 7 days treatment of 0.02%, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08% netarsudil 
once  or  twice  daily,  subtle  hypertrophy/hyperplasia  was  observed  at  all  dose  levels.  After  35  days 
treatment, hypertrophy/hyperplasia was only observed in animals exposed to 0.06% twice daily. 
Corneal  haze  described  as  diffuse  and  superficial  and  with  the  appearance  of  multiple,  very  fine, 
particulate depositions. Corneal haze was observed in monkeys in both the short (7 days) and long term 
studies (9 months). With higher doses, the haze appeared to develop earlier and was more pronounced. 
In the 9-months repeat-dose toxicity study in monkey, the incidence of haze increased with higher dose, 
but not the severity. The haze observed in the 7 day repeat-dose study with a high dose of netarsudil 
(0.12% QID) did not resolve after a period of 7 days without administration of netarsudil. In the longer 
studies  where  corneal  haze  was  observed  after  0.04%  netarsudil,  the  haze  had  resolved  after  2-4 
treatment free weeks. 
Retina 
Electroretinography was conducted in the studies in monkeys and no treatment related changes were 
observed. 
In one of the non-pivotal studies in monkeys where netarsudil was administered 4 times daily, vitreus 
haze, optic disc hyperaemia with indistinct optic disc margins, and retinal edema were observed in 2 and 
3 animals in the 0.04% and 0.12% groups respectively. The histopathological examination showed no 
inflammation or anatomical alterations. 
Intra ocular pressure  
Rhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intra ocular pressure (IOP). In the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies IOP was measured and dose-dependent reduction consistent with the intended pharmacology was 
indeed measured.  
Ocular adnexa 
There were several finding in the ocular adnexa (conjunctivae, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland, 
lacrimal  gland)  after  ocular  administration  of  netarsudil  in  both  rabbit  and  monkey.  The  primarily 
microscopic  finding  included  cellular  infiltrates  consistent  with  and/or  related  to  an  inflammatory 
response.  Other  findings  were  presence  of  lymphoid  follicles  in  the  palpebral  conjunctivae  (rabbit) 
hypertrophy  and  hyperplasia  of  the  conjunctival  epithelium  (monkey).  Lesions  in  the  conjunctiva 
observed after 35 days of treatment in male monkeys did not resolve during 2 weeks recovery period. 
Administration  of  netarsudil  0.06%  BID    in  female  rabbits  for  28  days  was  associated  with  dark 
appearance of the lacrimal glands. No microscopic correlation was found in this study. However, in studies 
in monkey, microscopic findings such as lymphocytic infiltration, interstitial lymphoid aggregates and/or 
follicles  in  the  lacrimal  glands  were  observed.  It  is  likely  that  these  observations  correspond  to  the 
inflammation seen in the eyelids and nasolacrimal ducts. 
Injection site 
Intravenous administration of netarsudil caused abnormal appearance and swelling of the injection site in 
rat, rabbit, and dog. In the pivotal study in dog, the severity and incidence was proportional to the dose 
and the reactions recovered during the 2 weeks of non-treatment. To ensure daily administrations in the 
embryofetal  development  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits,  animals  with  indwelling  catheters  and  vascular

access ports were used. The cause of these reactions is not fully understood but considered acceptable 
since the route of administration is not used in humans. 
Other organ systems 
Findings in rats and dogs toxicity studies regarding the haematological system were indications of anemia 
but are not considered relevant at the exposures observed after ocular administration. 
From the systemic toxicity studies several sporadic non consistent findings were observed in the liver, 
kidney,  pancreas,  testes,  and  epididymides.  Since  the  incidences  were  low  and  also  included  control 
animals, and/or only at clinically non-relevant exposures these findings are of no concern. 
Toxicokinetics and interspecies comparison 
It has not been possible to detect any systemic exposure in the human patients after the intended clinical 
dose. Thus, it was not possible to calculate an animal:human exposure multiple based on AUC. The lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ) in the bioanalysis for human samples was 0.1 ng/ml. This value was used to 
compare  with  Cmax  values  in  animals  and  to  calculate  exposure  multiples.  In  the  pivotal  repeat  dose 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs an exposure multiple of approximately 600-fold was estimated in both 
species. In the pivotal embryofetal development studies, comparison with Cmax and LLOQ rendered an 
exposure margin to NOAEL of 40 in rats and 200 in rabbits. 
Another way to estimate the margin for the systemic toxicity is to convert the NOAEL for systemic toxicity 
after  systemic  administration  to  the  amount  of  netarsudil  mesilate  required  to  achieve  the  human 
equivalent  dose  (HED).  Accordingly,  the  NOAEL  dose  1  mg/kg/day  established  in  rat  and  dogs  was 
converted to the HED. The HED per day for a 60 kg person is 9.6 mg and 32 mg based on the rat and dog 
data respectively. When netarsudil is administered in both eyes, the daily dose is 0.016 mg. Thus, the 
HED converted from the rat NOAEL was 600-fold, and from the dog 2000-fold the actual human dose. 
To compare the topical doses, the doses were normalized to the amount of drug applied in the eyes per 
day. In humans the total dose per day is 16 µg if both eyes are treated. In the pivotal studies in rabbits 
and monkeys the dose ranged from 16 to 64 µg, maximum 4 times the clinical dose calculated on daily 
basis.  
Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with the ICH S2(R1) guideline, including tests 
for gene mutations in bacteria and mouse lymphoma cells, and micronuclei in vivo, has been performed 
with netarsudil. All tests were negative. Based on the results of the conducted genotoxicity studies, the 
overall conclusion is that netarsudil does not have any genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity studies 
There  was  no  carcinogenicity  studies  presented.  The  lack  of  carcinogenicity  studies  is  acceptable 
considering the low plasma exposure to netarsudil, its enantiomer, and their metabolites in humans at the 
anticipated clinical dose. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
No studies evaluating the effects on fertility and early embryonic development studies were performed.  
Embryo-foetal development 
Seven embryo-fœtal development studies (EFD studies) were conducted. Five were dose-range finding 
studies, two were in non-gravid animals (one rat and one rabbit) and three in gravid animals (one rat and 
two rabbit). Two pivotal GLP studies in each of the species rat and rabbit were conducted. None of the 
Assessment report

studies  were  performed  in  pigmented  animals  although  it  has  been  shown  that  netarsudil  binds  to 
melanin. This is considered acceptable. 
The observed injection site irritation observed in the dose range finding studies led to the decision to use 
animals with implanted vascular access ports in the pivotal study to ensure reliable administration in the 
animals.  The  information  on  how  the  catheters  were  implanted  and  if  there  was  any  concomitant 
medication (pain relief and antibiotics) is very limited.  
Rats were administered 0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg/day. Rabbits were administered 0, 0.5, 3 and 5 
mg/kg. 
In both studies a dose dependent increase in the % post implantation loss (from 8.6 to 100% in rats and 
from 1.2% to 12.7% in rabbits. There were no AR-13324 related fetal external, soft tissue, or skeletal 
fetal malformations or variations at any dose. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function  
No  studies  were  performed.  The  lack  of  pre-  and  postnatal  studies  is  acceptable  considering  the  low 
plasma exposure to netarsudil, its enantiomer, and their metabolites in humans at the anticipated clinical 
dose.  
Juvenile animals 
No  studies  were  performed.  The  lack  of  studies  in  juvenile  animals  is  acceptable  considering  the 
product-specific waiver for all subsets of paediatric population on the grounds that the specific medicinal 
product  does  not  represent  a  significant  therapeutic  benefit  over  existing  treatments  for  paediatric 
patients. 
Metabolites 
The  ophthalmic 
formulations 
in  the  pivotal  ocular  studies  were 
intentionally  spiked  with 
the active metabolite AR-13503.  
Impurities 
The  R-enantiomer  of  netarsudil  AR-13323  has  been  intentionally  spiked  in  the  solutions  administered 
both intravenously and topical in the eyes. In the safety pharmacology studies the concentration of the 
R-enantiomer  was  approximately  11%,  in  the  pivotal  toxicity  studies  the  formulations  contained  5 % 
R-enantiomer. In the final formulation the level of the R-enantiomer in the product specification is set to 
3.5%. The R-enantiomer is considered sufficiently qualified in the non-clinical toxicity studies.  
The impurities 2,4-dimethyl benzoic acid, DBMPP acid, and the starting material 6-AIQ were added to a 
level of 0.5 % in the ophthalmic formulations used in the pivotal ocular toxicity studies. These impurities 
can be considered qualified at the proposed levels in the final product (0.25 %). 
Phototoxicity 
Netarsudil absorbs light in the lower range of the UV visible spectrum (<330 nm). At the absorbance 
maxima at 288 nm the molar extinction coefficient (MEC) of netarsudil (10914 Lmol-1/cm) was greater 
than the threshold (1000 Lmol-1/cm). To further investigate the phototoxic potential of netarsudil a 3T3 
NRU-PT  study  was  conducted  which  showed  that  netarsudil  was  not  phototoxic  at  the  UV  spectra 
investigated (UVA, 320-400 nm).  
Other studies 
No specific studies on local tolerance, antigenicity, immunotoxicity, or dependence have been performed, 
which is considered acceptable.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA is based on netarsudil which has a molecular weight of 454 g/mol (free base) and is freely soluble 
in water. The log Kow was reported to be 4.44, and the log D7.4 was reported to be 3.57. However, no 
sufficient references or reports have been provided and the details for the determination of log KOW and 
logD7.4 are therefore unknown. The applicant was in the first round asked to provide sufficient and 
assessable information regarding the determination. The requested report was provided but the 
determinations were however not performed with the methods that are clearly recommended by the EMA 
(see the ERA guideline). Since the presented LogKOW (4.44) was close to the value for when a screen for 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity should be done (LogKOW >4.5), this is not acceptable and the 
applicant is requested to provide a study where determinations of LogKOW and LogD with EMA 
recommended methods. The applicant has stated that the requested study is ongoing and that the results 
will be submitted by the Day 180 responses or post approval. (Unresolved issue) 
The PECSURFACE WATER for netarsudil is less than the action limit 0.01 µg/L. No further analysis is 
therefore required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Netarsudil (AR-13324) is a potent inhibitor of human ROCK 1 and 2 and its metabolite is about 5-fold 
more potent at these targets. However, the selectivity of netarsudil and its metabolite are  questioned. 
Both the primary and secondary pharmacodynamics in vitro screens reveal that netarsudil and its 
metabolite have the potential to inhibit numerous human protein kinases and other non-kinase targets. 
As the systemic exposure is low/negligible in the clinical situation, the main concern is potential local 
off-target effects. Therefore, a discussion of the potential biological consequences of inhibiting these 
additional targets, locally in the eye, was requested. The applicant has not found any relevant literature 
information to predict whether inhibition of any of the off-targets would have the potential to cause local 
ocular toxicity. No data on expression of these targets in ocular tissues has been provided. In study 
AR-13324-IPH01, netarsudil and its metabolite (AR-13503) were  tested at concentrations between 0.01 
nM to 100 µM. Both netarsudil and its metabolite show potent inhibition on protein kinase N2, protein 
kinase A and protein kinase MRCK alpha with Kis in the same range as ROCK1 and 2. Thus, inhibition of 
these targets is very likely if they are expressed in ocular tissues. In study AR 13324 IPH02, netarsudil 
and AR-13084 (racemate of the metabolites of netarsudil and AR-13323) at 0.5 µM showed significant 
inhibition of 24 and 17, respectively, additional protein kinases, but IC50 values were not further 
determined. In the human non-kinase screen (AR 13324 IPH03), netarsudil at 10 µM showed significant 
inhibition of more than 20 non-kinase proteins. It is agreed that the test concentration was rather high, 
but as IC50 values were not further determined, it is not possible to reason on the likelihood for 
interaction with these targets in the clinical situation. Based on the available data, it can be concluded that 
netarsudil and its metabolite are not selective inhibitors of ROCK 1 and 2. However, as the expression of 
the potential off-targets in ocular tissues is not known, it is unclear if off-target interactions contribute to 
the observed ocular safety profile.  
Overall, the applicant proposes that netarsudil treatment lowers IOP by three mechanisms; increasing 
aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork (outflow facility), decreasing the production of 
aqueous humor, and lowering of episcleral venous pressure. Based on the available data, the proposed 
mechanisms seem plausible.

The IOP-lowering effect of netarsudil was studied in normotensive rabbits and monkeys. It was noted that 
the ocular hypotensive effect did not increase proportionally to the increasing concentration of AR-13324. 
In rabbits (study AR-13324-APH04), the concentration of AR-13324 solution increased twice; from 
0.02% to 0.04% but maximal IOP reductions were 7.0 mmHg and 7.1 mmHg at 4 hours after dosing, 
respectively and 1.3 mmHg and 1.5 mmHg at 24 hours after dosing, respectively. As all studies were 
performed in normotensive animals, this may explain a weak response on antihypertensive activity of 
AR-13324. The applicant was asked to elaborate on why no any animal model with elevated IOP or with 
glaucoma was chosen and to further discuss the correlation between results obtained in normotensive 
animals and results of studies performed in glaucoma patients. According to the applicant, the main 
reason for choosing normotensive animals was that the majority of models with elevated IOP have a 
damaged or altered function of the trabecular meshwork (TM) or the TM outflow pathway. As TM is the 
target tissue for netarsudil’s IOP lowering effect the potential damage of this tissue could limit the ability 
to measure netarsudil’s activity. Moreover, the correlation between the results of studies performed on 
normotensive animals (monkey) and patients with glaucoma (AR-13324-APH06) was discussed. In 
monkeys, once-daily AM dosing of netarsudil 0.02% for 3 days produced a maximum IOP reduction of 5.8 
and trough IOP reduction of 4.9 mmHg 24 hours after dosing. In the AR-13324-CS201 clinical study, 
once-daily AM dosing of netarsudil 0.02% for 7 days produced a maximum IOP reduction of 6.9 mmHg 
and trough IOP reduction of 5.3 mmHg 24 hours after dosing. In addition, the applicant ensures that IOP 
reduction achieved by netarsudil in normotensive animals is larger than has been reported for other drug 
classes, and this is believed to be related to the ability of netarsudil to lower episcleral venous pressure, 
which limits IOP lowering due to the resistance to outflow contributed by episcleral venous pressure. 
However, even with this activity, the use of normotensive animals may limit the ability to measure the full 
dose response of netarsudil.  
The effect of netarsudil on episcleral venous pressure was studied in Dutch Belted rabbits. Taking into 
account that prolonged continuous recordings of episcleral venous pressure are difficult due to technical 
problems and severe conjunctival oedema, which tended to develop 1-2 hours into the experiments - the 
applicant was asked to justify the choice of species for this experiment and to further discuss the 
reliability of the results. The applicant argues that Dutch-belted rabbits are relevant due to their 
pigmented ocular tissues as netarsudil bind to melanin. This is agreed. The applicant has further clarified 
that the decrease in episcleral venous pressure is indeed caused by netarsudil. Vehicle control animals 
demonstrated that procedure-related effects such as oedema do not produce a reduction in EVP but 
appear to cause an increase in episcleral venous pressure. 
One of the identified off-targets was the norepinephrine transporter (NET). The applicant speculates that 
NET inhibition may contribute to the IOP lowering activity of netarsudil. However, this hypothesis has not 
been confirmed by solid experimental data. However, as no claims are made on this hypothesis, no 
further action is warranted.   
A deficiency in the documentation is the lack of data on activity of netarsudil on ROCK 1 and 2 in the 
animal species used for safety evaluation. The applicant has provided a reference to the HomoloGene 
database showing a conserved amino acid homology of ROCK 1 across a diverse array of animal species. 
The database reports a homology of 99.6%, 97.6%, 94.8% and 96.6% in monkey, dog, rat and mouse, 
respectively, to the human ROCK 1 sequence. In published literature, the pharmacology of netarsudil and 
its metabolite (AR-13503), on ROCK1/2 has been shown in biochemical and cell-based assays, and in 
mouse, rabbit, pig, dog and monkey in vivo. Additionally, netarsudil causes reductions in IOP in rabbits 
and monkeys, and signs (trace to mild hyperaemia) likely to be related to the primary pharmacodynamics 
(i.e. vasodilation) were observed in pharmacology and toxicology studies in rats, dogs, rabbits and 
monkeys. Taken together, it is agreed that all species tested within the non-clinical program (rat, rabbit, 
dog and monkey) are likely relevant species and that safety aspects related to the primary 
pharmacodynamics have been adequately evaluated.

Hyperaemia is also reported as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials (SmPC section 4.8) and is 
likely caused by smooth muscle cell relaxation causing local vasodilation. 
Netarsudil, but not its metabolite, was shown to induce phospholipidosis in CHO-K1 cells with an EC50 of 
1.1 µM (~500 ng/mL). As observed in tissue distribution studies, once netarsudil is absorbed into the eye, 
it is rapidly converted to the active metabolite. Thus, intraocular concentrations of netarsudil are likely to 
be much lower than the micromolar concentrations required for phospholipidosis, while phospholipidosis 
might be seen within the cornea. Thus, it seems plausible that phospholipidosis may cause the corneal 
haze observed in monkey studies (see toxicology section), and the findings of “corneal deposits” and 
“corneal verticillata” observed in Phase 3 clinical studies. Corneal verticillata is a pattern of whorl-shaped 
opacities within the basal corneal epithelium and has been observed as a side effect of drugs across many 
pharmacologic classes causing intracellular phospholipid accumulation. 
Both netarsudil and its metabolite are considered adequately evaluated with regards to safety 
pharmacology. No CNS effects were observed in any of the studies performed. 
Netarsudil inhibits hERG with an IC50 of 0.4 μM (~181 ng/ml).  The IC50 is about 1800-fold a maximal 
systemic netarsudil Cmax, bound (LLOQ 0.1 ng/ml) in the clinical situation. Taking into account the high 
plasma protein binding (99.8% at 100 µM), the free plasma concentrations in humans are considered 
negligible. The active metabolite was not tested in the GLP hERG assay. However, AR-13084, the 
metabolite of the racemate AR-13165 (comprising of 50% AR-13503) was examined in the off-target 
screen of non-kinase proteins (including hERG) and showed no hERG inhibition at 10 µM. 
In the single iv dose dog telemetry study, no QTc prolongation was observed up to mean Cmax values of 
872 ng/ml. At Cmax exposures of ~400 ng/ml and above, decreased arterial pressure and increased 
heart rate were observed. The NOEL for the effects on arterial pressure and heart rate was 0.7 mg/kg. At 
this dose, average plasma level of netarsudil was 26.6 ng/ml while the level of metabolite AR-13503 was 
below LLOQ (1.0 ng/ml). These effects are likely pharmacodynamics effects of netarsudil. Rho kinase 
inhibitors reduce blood pressure by decreasing vascular smooth muscle contractility and thereby reducing 
vascular tone causing vasodilation. The increased heart rate is likely a secondary effect. No 
cardiovascular effects were observed in the 28-day repeat-dose iv dog study up to average netarsudil 
Cmax values of 63.3/51.51 ng/ml in males/females and average AR-13503 Cmax values of 1.51/1.80 
ng/ml in males/females. 
Based on the available data, no CNS or CV effects are expected following ocular topical administration of 
netarsudil in man.  
Pharmacokinetics 
All bioanalytical method validation reports have been submitted. None of the method validations applied 
in pivotal toxicology studies were formally performed under GLP. The applicant has provided information 
on the aspects of the bioanalytic method validations that were not according to GLP and discussed the 
impact on the analysis of the samples collected in the pivotal toxicology GLP studies. 
The Contract Laboratory, Tandem Labs, operates its laboratory in accordance with principles of GLP. 
Tandem Labs SOPs, analytical procedures, and methods were followed during the conduct of the method 
validations. Qualified analysts, using calibrated equipment with appropriate documentation, performed 
assays. The validations were conducted in accordance with Tandem Labs standard operating procedures, 
and methods, and followed pre-established standard procedures with pre-established acceptance criteria. 
The deviations from GLP include no formal designation of a Study Director (instead a responsible Principal 
Investigator), no formal study protocol (instead a Validation Analytical Plan) and some limitations in QAU 
Assessment report

inspections. However, QAU reviewed all validation data and audited validation reports in agreement with 
specifications in the Validation Analytical Plan. Taken together, the deviations from GLP are not 
considered to have impact on the results in the pivotal GLP toxicity studies. 
In vitro and in vivo studies show that netarsudil and its metabolite bind melanin, thus raising a potential 
concern for phototoxicity (see toxicology section).  
Based on the proposed MoA, the assumed target tissues for ROCK 1/2 inhibition are the trabecular 
meshwork, the ciliary epithelium, and the episcleral veins. Based on the available data from topical ocular 
administration of netarsudil in rabbits, the applicant has provided estimation on target tissue exposure in 
the clinical situation. The applicant estimates that the concentration of AR-13503 in the target tissues in 
healthy rabbits could range from approximately 67 ng/g to 229 ng/g tissue (data from 
retina-choroid-plexus in study PG324-APK01). Using these data and the estimated molecular weight of 
AR-13503 (~306 g/mol), the estimated concentrations could range from 0.22 to 0.75 µM. As reported in 
the literature, ocular pharmacokinetics parameters of some glaucoma drugs (e.g. brimonidine and 
dexamethasone) are lower in the disease model compared to in normal animals, suggesting that ocular 
concentrations in glaucoma patients may be lower than that estimated from healthy rabbits. 
Overall, the metabolic pathway of netarsudil appears to be common to rats, rabbits, dogs, cynomolgus 
monkeys and humans. Thus, the selected species are considered relevant from a metabolism perspective. 
In a secondary pharmacology screen at 10 µM, netarsudil and AR-13165 (a racemic mixture of netarsudil 
and its enantiomer, AR-13323) showed significant inhibitory activity against five cytochrome P450s (1A2, 
2C19, 2C6, 2D6 and 3A4). AR-13084, the metabolite of AR-13165, exhibited inhibitory activity against 
CYPs 2C19 and 2D6. The metabolite of netarsudil, AR-13503, was not tested in the assay but is 
considered covered by testing of AR-13084. Based on the low/negligible plasma concentrations of 
netarsudil and its metabolite (AR-13503) detected following topical ocular administration, a risk for 
systemic DDIs is considered minute. However, as all targeted CYPs with exception of CYP1A2, are 
reported to be expressed in human cornea, the applicant was asked to further discuss the potential for 
pharmacokinetic interactions of other topical ocular medicinal products likely to be used concomitantly in 
the intended patient population. As outlined by the applicant, various classes of topical ophthalmic 
medications could also be concomitantly used with Rhokiinsa. However, the clinical significance of 
potential DDIs, specifically within the cornea, is not well-characterised. There has been a lack of DDI-type 
events in large-scale human clinical studies conducted to date, and pharmacovigilance data since the 
launch of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% in the US. Taken together, the lack of reported DDI-type 
events in the clinical situation indicates that this may be a concern of low or no significance. 
Toxicology 
The repeat-dose toxicity studies of Rhokiinsa were conducted in rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. It is not 
clear why these species were chosen and why none of the species were evaluated for both ocular and 
systemic route of administration toxicity. The applicant was asked to further elaborate on the selection of 
species. Different aspects including pharmacokinetics and route of administration were taken into 
consideration during selection of species. No species-specific or gender differences have been observed 
regarding pharmacology or toxicity which supports the relevance of the selected species. 
The systemic exposure after topical administration in the eye was very low in both rabbit and monkeys. 
The systemic toxicity was investigated in two pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs for 28 
days. The maximum dose administered was 1 mg/kg in both species. Based on the earlier shorter non 
pivotal repeat-dose studies, a maximum dose higher than 1 mg/kg would have strengthened the study as 
well as enabling to establish a NOAEL. However, since the systemic exposure after ocular administration 
is negligible, iv administration of 1 mg/kg is considered to provide a sufficient margin.

The main finding after topical administration in the eye in all species was signs of irritation. Severity and 
incidence increased with dose but ocular irritation was also observed in vehicle treated animals. In most 
cases, the irritation declined with time during pursued treatment. These types of findings were very 
common in patients. Conjunctival hyperaemia was reported in 50% of the patients. It is recommended to 
administer Rhokiinsa in the evening which might help the patients to tolerate the transient period of 
irritation. 
In the rabbit degeneration/erosion of the cornea was observed with netarsudil concentrations of 0.04% 
twice daily and above. The overall epithelial layer was thinner but had not progressed to areas denuded 
of corneal epithelium. Histopathological examination showed corneal lesions consisting of peripheral 
vascularization, mixed cell inflammation and attenuation of the overlying corneal epithelium. In the 
treated patients, a few cases suggestive of corneal erosion were noted. In the first round of the 
procedure, the applicant was asked to discuss the possible mechanism of action for the corneal 
degeneration/erosion effects and the clinical relevance, especially concerning the long term continuous 
use in glaucoma. The applicant referred to data on laboratory rabbits which shows a high incidence of 
spontaneous corneal lesions. Furthermore, the animals are exposed to multiple ophthalmic tests and 
repeated topical ocular dosing procedure. The procedures in them self or the consequences of, such as 
decreased blinking could also contribute. In the clinical setting, the applicant suggests that the higher 
incidence eye pruritis and irritation could produce more frequent eye rubbing which could explain the 
higher incidence of punctuate keratopathy. It is not possible to draw any conclusions based on 
non-clinical data regarding the safety in this aspect for a long-term continuous treatment of netarsudil. 
Another clinically relevant observation was corneal haze. Corneal haze was described as diffuse and 
superficial with the appearance of multiple, very fine, particulate depositions. It seems plausible that the 
corneal haze is caused by phospholipidosis. 
In one of the non-pivotal studies in monkeys where netarsudil was administered 4 times daily, vitreus 
haze, optic disc hyperaemia with indistinct optic disc margins, and retinal oedema were observed in 2 and 
3 animals in the 0.04% and 0.12% groups respectively. The histopathological examination showed no 
inflammation or anatomical alterations. The applicant argues that these findings can be explained by the 
reduced IOP. It is however not fully understood why these findings were specifically attributed to the 
reduced IOP or if other possibilities were considered. In the first round of the procedure the applicant was 
requested to further discuss the findings and possible clinical implications. In the response, the applicant 
states that uveal effusion syndrome and hypotony maculopathy are well-characterized ophthalmic clinical 
conditions caused by low IOP. This is only partly agreed since uveal effusion syndrome is associated with 
normal or elevated IOP while the hypotony maculopathy is indeed caused by low IOP and could be 
triggered by exaggerated pharmacology when elevated IOP is treated. The issue is not further pursued. 
The eye drops solution contains 0.015% benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as a microbial preservative. In the 
pharmacology section it is described that increasing the BAK concentration from 0.0075% to 0.015% 
might yield a slight improvement in efficacy, without significantly reducing apparent tolerability. In the 
section above, however, several findings have been described that are indicative of reduced tolerability. 
The applicant was requested to discuss the possible role of BAK in the corneal damage findings. In the 
response, the applicant has discussed the findings from the studies with vehicle (including BAK) alone. No 
discussion regarding the potential effect of BAK on the tolerability of netarsudil was provided. In the 
studies, no control group without BAK was included; it is thus not possible to draw any conclusion if the 
background corneal lesions or damage are attributable to the treatment or the multiple ophthalmic tests. 
However, the applicant has committed to reviewing the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) in 
the existing formulation to determine if a concentration of less than the current 0.015% level would still 
ensure a safe and efficacious formulation (see further discussion in section 2.6.1).

Exposure margins for systemic toxicity with the negligible systemic exposure in the patients can be 
considered sufficient. For the ocular route and ocular effects the margins are substantially lower. In the 
pivotal animal studies the clinical concentration (0.02%) was investigated together with a lower (0.01%) 
and higher (0.04%) concentration. The margin consisted mainly of the fact that the animals were dosed 
twice daily and humans are dosed once daily. Similar ocular adverse reactions were observed in both 
rabbits and monkeys as well as humans.  
The genotoxicity study package of netarsudil was in agreement with the ICH S2(R1) guideline. In the in 
vivo micronucleus assay historical control data was included as positive control. The applicant has 
presented “Rat micronucleus test historical control data 2006-2010” and the study was conducted during 
2011. It is not clear from the report from which strain of rats the historical data is collected from. Nor is 
the reliability to detect increases in micronuclei demonstrated. These deficiencies are however not 
considered to have an impact on the conclusion of the study since the number of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes is very low in all treatment groups. In the first round of the procedure, the 
Applicant was asked to assess the genotoxicity of netarsudil mesylate R-enantiomer as a potential chiral 
impurity. The product specification (shelf life) is set to 3.5%, which renders 0.6 µg/day, presuming a 40 
µL drop into each eye once daily. This level is not of toxicological concern for genotoxicity in Rhokiinsa 
finished product in accordance with ICH M7 (R1) (<1.5 µg/day).  
The lack of carcinogenicity, fertility, and pre- postnatal studies is acceptable considering the low plasma 
exposure to netarsudil, its enantiomer, and their metabolites in humans at the anticipated clinical dose. 
The in vitro study to investigate the phototoxic potential of netarsudil was conducted with the standard 
light spectra UVA (filter 320-400 nm). In the case of netarsudil, induction of phototoxicity by UVB is 
however more relevant and the experiment should have been conducted with modified irradiation 
conditions. In the first round of the procedure, the applicant was asked to submit a 3T3 NRU-PT study with 
modified irradiation conditions to assess the phototoxicity of UVB or justify the absence of such a study. 
The applicant did not provide a solid justification on why the study was not performed with the adjusted 
wavelengths, which would have been the scientific rational considering the ultraviolet absorption 
spectrum of netarsudil. The residence time of netarsudil in the cornea is stated to have a tmax of 0.5 to 
8 hours post dose, which gives both time and a location where potential reactions could occur. This 
resident time is likely based on tissue distribution data following single topical ocular administration in 
rabbits. At 24 hours following a single topical ocular administration, the corneal concentrations were 
approximately 30% of the maximal concentrations indicating a significant exposure during day-time. 
Based on the estimated corneal half-life (~13 hours), drug accumulation seems likely following repeated 
administration. With respect to the long term treatment of patients, further efforts to adequately assess 
whether netarsudil has a phototoxic potential or not should be made. The applicant submitted a 3T3 
NRU-PT study with modified irradiation conditions to assess potential UVB induced phototoxicity as a 
response to a request in the second round of the procedure. The study was performed both on AR-13324 
and its active metabolite AR-13503. It was concluded that AR-13324 has a probable phototoxic potential 
and AR-13503 has a phototoxic potential. It is stated in the ICH Guidance S10 on Photosafety Evaluation 
of Pharmaceuticals that a positive 3T3 NRU-PT should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical 
phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for follow-up assessment. There are, however, no established 
non-clinical in vitro or in vivo ocular models that can be used for follow-up assessment of ocular 
phototoxicity. Other measures have thus to be taken into consideration to determine if the finding is 
clinically relevant.  
The potential phototoxicity of AR-13324 and AR-13503 is included in section 5.3, as follow: “Netarsudil 
and its active metabolite AR-13503 were found to have a possible phototoxic potential in a modified 3T3 
NRU-PT in vitro assay, where the wavelength was extended to include UVB light.”

From a non-clinical perspective, it is not possible to elucidate this further and the concern needs to be 
further pursued with clinical data.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
To support this application, one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study (AR-13324-CS101) in healthy 
volunteers was conducted to assess the systemic absorption of AR-13324, and its active metabolite 
AR-13503, following once daily topical ocular dosing of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02%.

Analytical methods 
Plasma concentrations of AR-13324 and its active metabolite AR-13503 were determined using a high 
performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method validated with respect to 
accuracy, precision, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. The LLOQ for AR-13324 and AR-13503 was 
0.100 ng/ml.  
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
Study AR-13324-CS101, a Phase 1, open-label, non-comparative, single-arm, single-center study of 
AR-13324 ophthalmic solution 0.02% in 18 healthy volunteers, evaluated the systemic exposure of 
AR-13324 and its active metabolite AR-13503. Subjects received AR-13324 ophthalmic solution 0.02%, 
one drop in each eye in the morning, for 8 days.  
On Days 1 and 8, a member of the Investigator’s staff instilled the study medication. On Days 2 to 7, 
subjects self-administered their investigational medication at home. No formal measure was used to 
guarantee treatment adherence on Days 2 to 7. However, subjects recorded administration times in a 
diary, and the administration times of doses for each subject on all days were provided in the Appendices. 
Inspection of these administration times showed that all subjects administered all doses of the study 
medication at the appropriate time on all days, except for one dose in one patient. Further, the subject’s 
eye drop instillation performance was evaluated at qualification visit, to assure that the subject could 
correctly instil 1 drop (and 1 drop only) of an artificial tear into each eye.  
Blood samples were obtained for bioanalytical assessment of AR-13324 and its metabolite AR-13503 at 
the following times post dose on Day 1: 15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours, and at the following times 
on Day 8: predose (-30 min), 15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 23.5 hours post dose.  
All available data from all 18 subjects were included in the PK population. There were no observed plasma 
AR-13334 concentrations above the LLOQ (0.100 ng/ml) at any time point in any subject. Only 1 plasma 
concentration above the LLOQ for AR-13503 (metabolite) was observed in 1 subject on Day 8 at 8 hours 
post dose (0.11 ng/ml, LLOQ of 0.100 ng/ml). The maximum molar concentration of netarsudil (MW 
453.21) in plasma was therefore <0.2 nM, which is more than 1000 times below the IC50 for netarsudil 
effects on actomyosin dynamics in human cells (219 nM; AR-13324-IPH04). For AR-13503 (MW 321.37), 
the maximum plasma concentration was 0.3 nM or lower, which is more than 200 times below its 
cell-based IC50 for effects on actomyosin dynamics (64 nM; AR-13324-IPH04). 
Distribution 
In vitro, AR-13324 showed high protein binding in human plasma (97-100% bound). Less protein binding 
in human plasma was observed with active metabolite AR-13503 (60-70% bound) (Study 
AR-13324-IPK01). 
Elimination 
•  Metabolism 
Preliminary studies investigating the in vitro metabolism of AR-13324 were performed using corneal 
tissue from humans. Based on these studies (AR-13324-IPK03), after topical ocular dosing, AR-13324 is 
metabolised by esterases in corneal tissues to an active metabolite AR-13503. There is no subsequent 
metabolism of metabolite AR-13503.

Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In Study AR-13324-CS101, only one concentration of netarsudil ophthalmic solution was evaluated, 
0.02%. Thus, no pharmacokinetic evaluation of dose proportionality was conducted. There was no 
evidence of accumulation of AR-13324 or metabolite AR-13503 with repeated once daily topical dosing. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Blood levels of netarsudil and its principle metabolite, AR-13503, were insufficient to evaluate 
pharmacokinetic variability. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
No clinical PK or metabolism studies were conducted in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
The PK of netarsudil in healthy volunteers determined in the phase 1 PK study were considered to be 
predictive of the PK in the target patient population. 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal or hepatic function 
No studies were conducted in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment. Given the relatively 
low ocular dose (16 μg for bilateral, once-daily dosing of 40 μL of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02%), 
it is unlikely that renal impairment or hepatic impairment would influence the pharmacokinetics of 
ocularly-instilled netarsudil 0.02%. 
• 
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment for elderly patients is specified in the proposed SmPC. Study AR-13324-CS101 
included 18 healthy adult subjects of ages 24-74 years (mean 47.6 years). In all subjects at all time 
points, plasma concentrations of AR-13324 or its active metabolite AR-13503 were negligible. Therefore, 
the PK of AR-13324 or AR-13503 in older people are unlikely to be altered and a dosage adjustment in 
elderly patients is not necessary.

•  Children 
No studies were conducted in paediatric patients, which is acceptable since AR-13324 ophthalmic solution 
is only indicated for adult patients. 
Interactions 
In vitro (AR-13324-IPH03), when screened at 10 µM, netarsudil and AR-13165 (a racemic mixture of 
netarsudil and its enantiomer, AR-13323) showed significant inhibitory activity against five cytochrome 
P450s (1A2, 2C19, 2C6, 2D6 and 3A4). AR-13084, the metabolite of AR-13165, exhibited inhibitory 
activity against CYPs 2C19 and 2D6. The metabolite of netarsudil, AR-13503, was not tested in the assay 
but is considered covered by testing of AR-13165. 
As all targeted CYPs except CYP1A2 are reported to be expressed in human cornea, the applicant was 
asked to further discuss the potential for local drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other topical ocular 
medicinal products. As outlined by the applicant, various classes of topical ophthalmic medications may 
be used concomitantly with netarsudil ophthalmic solution. However, the clinical significance of potential 
DDIs, specifically within the cornea, is not well-characterized. There has been a lack of DDI-type events 
in large-scale human clinical studies conducted with netarsudil to date, and pharmacovigilance data since 
the launch of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% in the US. Therefore, the potential for topical DDIs in 
the clinical situation is considered to be a concern of low or no significance. 
No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. This is acceptable given the negligible exposure 
to AR-13324, or the active metabolite AR-13503, following topical ocular dosing once daily with netarsudil 
ophthalmic solution 0.02%. The potential for systemic drug-drug interactions is therefore minimal in the 
intended patient population. 
Conclusion 
The systemic exposure to AR-13324 and the metabolite AR-13503 was shown to be negligible following 
repeat topical ocular once daily administration of 0.02% AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution in 18 healthy 
subjects. Given these low plasma concentrations, and the fact that AR-13324 and, to a lesser extent 
active metabolite AR-13503, are  highly protein-bound in plasma (nonclinical study AR-13324-IPK01), it 
is unlikely that netarsudil would have any systemic pharmacological effects after topical ocular dosing in 
humans, nor the potential for systemic drug-drug interactions. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction 
To support this application, one clinical study (AR-13324-CS102) in healthy volunteers was conducted to 
study aqueous humor dynamics in the eye following once daily topical ocular dosing of netarsudil 
ophthalmic solution 0.02%. 
Mechanism of action 
Netarsudil is a potent Rho kinase inhibitor and a norepinephrine transporter inhibitor. Both of these 
biochemical activities likely contribute to the multiple mechanisms by which topical netarsudil influences 
aqueous humor dynamics and lowers IOP. In human and animal studies, netarsudil was shown to reduce 
IOP by multiple mechanisms of action including increasing trabecular outflow facility, decreasing the 
production of aqueous humor, and reducing episcleral venous pressure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019  
Page 40/122

Primary pharmacology 
Study AR-13324-CS102, a double-masked, randomised, single-centre, placebo-controlled, contralateral 
eye comparison study, evaluated the effect of AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.02% on aqueous humor 
dynamics in healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive investigational product, AR-13324 
Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%, one drop, once daily in one eye, and AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution Placebo 
once daily in the fellow eye, for 7 days. 11 subjects were randomised and treated, and 10 subjects whom 
completed the study.  
No formal measure was used to guarantee treatment adherence when subjects self-administered the eye 
drops at home. However, Listing 16.2.5.3 indicates that all subjects used the eye drops for 7 days. In 
addition, the subject’s eye drop instillation performance was evaluated at screening, to assure that the 
subject could correctly instil 1 drop (and 1 drop only) of an artificial tear into each eye. 
In study subjects, once daily topical ocular dosing of AR-13324 ophthalmic solution 0.02% lowered IOP 
(mean change from baseline -4.6 mmHg, ~27%) through multiple mechanisms of action including 
increasing outflow facility, decreasing episcleral venous pressure, and reducing aqueous humor 
production (Table 4), which is consistent with nonclinical studies.  
 The dominant effect produced by AR-13324 is an increase in trabecular outflow facility; accounting for 
about half of the measured decrease in IOP. This is consistent with the ability of AR-13503, the active 
metabolite of AR-13324 and the predominant form of the drug in aqueous humor, to increase trabecular 
outflow facility in perfused enucleated human eyes (Study AR-13324-IPH05), and the ability of AR-13324 
to increase outflow facility in non-human primates (Wang 2015). 
Secondary pharmacology 
No secondary clinical pharmacology studies were conducted. In an in vitro study (AR-13324-IS03), the 
IC50 for the inhibitory effect of netarsudil on hERG potassium current was 0.4 μM (i.e. 181 ng/ml), which 
is well above the plasma concentrations detected in the clinical PK study (AR-13324-CS101). Therefore, 
with topical ocular dosing, the potential for QT prolongation is considered minimal. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No studies of pharmacodynamic drug interactions were performed, other than as described in two 
nonclinical studies, where netarsudil and latanoprost were administered in combination in rabbits and 
monkeys to study tolerability and hypotensive efficacy.  
Conclusion 
Netarsudil mesylate (AR-13324) is a potent inhibitor of Rho kinase that also has inhibitory activity against 
norepinephrine transporter. AR-13324 appears to lower IOP through multiple mechanisms of action: 
increasing trabecular outflow facility (the dominant effect), decreasing the production of aqueous humor, 
and reducing episcleral venous pressure.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the clinical pharmacokinetic study AR-13324-CS101, there were no observed plasma netarsudil 
concentrations above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ = 0.100 ng/ml) at any time point in any 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

subject, except for 1 plasma sample from one subject being very close to the LLOQ (i.e., 0.11 ng/ml) for 
the metabolite AR-13503. The maximum molar concentration of netarsudil (MW 453.21) in plasma was 
therefore <0.2 nM, which is more than 1000 times below the IC50 for netarsudil effects on actomyosin 
dynamics in human cells (219 nM; AR-13324-IPH04). For AR-13503 (MW 321.37), the maximum plasma 
concentration was 0.3 nM or lower, which is more than 200 times below its cell-based IC50 for effects on 
actomyosin dynamics (64 nM; AR-13324-IPH04). Given these low plasma concentrations, and the fact 
that netarsudil and, to a lesser extent, AR-13503 are highly protein-bound in plasma (AR-13324-IPK01), 
it is unlikely that netarsudil would have any systemic pharmacological effects after topical ocular dosing 
in humans, nor the potential for systemic drug-drug interactions. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Netarsudil is a potent Rho kinase inhibitor and a norepinephrine transporter inhibitor. In a clinical study of 
aqueous humor dynamics (AR-13324-CS102), AR-13324 was shown to reduce IOP by multiple 
mechanisms of action including increasing trabecular outflow facility (the dominant effect), decreasing 
the production of aqueous humor, and reducing episcleral venous pressure, which is consistent with 
nonclinical studies.  
Netarsudil mode of action is different to that of the already approved authorised topical anti-glaucoma 
products. It is therefore proposed to restrict initiation of the treatment to ophthalmologists or healthcare 
professionals qualified in ophthalmology. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant’s conclusions for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments are supported.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant is seeking an authorisation for netarsudil (Rhokiinsa) in the following indication: for the 
reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension.  
The applicant has submitted five efficacy studies: 2 phase II and 3 phase III studies.  All of the phase III 
studies and one phase II study were non-inferiority active controlled randomised trials. 
The populations included in the phase 3 trials are broadly similar; all use Timolol maleate ophthalmic 
solution 0.05% as the control. On the other hand, the population included in the phase 2 RCTs had higher 
maximum baseline levels of intraocular pressure than those in the phase 3 studies. In addition, the 
control in the active controlled phase 2 study was latanaprost 0.002% rather than timolol 0.05%. The 
main features of the studies are shown in the following table.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dose chosen for the pivotal study was Netarsudil 0.02% daily.  
The applicant conducted three studies that could broadly be considered as dose finding studies. The first 
a 7-day phase IIa study (Study AR-13324-CS201) compared 3 dose strengths of netarsudil (0.04%, 
0.02% and 0.01%) with placebo. A subsequent 28 day phase IIb non-inferiority study (Study 
AR-13324-CS202) compared Netarsudil 0.02%, and Netarsudil 0.01% with latanoprost 0.002%.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were broadly similar in the two phase II studies and encompassed higher 
baseline IOPs than subsequent trials. 
A phase III non-inferiority study (Study AR-13324-CS302) compared Netarsudil 0.02% OD and netarsudil 
0.02% BID with Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% BID. 
Study AR-13324-CS201 had a primary efficacy endpoint of mean IOP across subjects within treatment 
groups in Day at each post-treatment time point (08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hours). mean change 
from baseline at day 8 was greater for Netardusil 0.02% and 0.04% than Netardusil 0.01% at most time 
points and marginally greater for Netarsudil 0.02% compared to 0.04%. It can be concluded that the top 
of the dose response curve was reached with a dose of Netarsudil 0.02% OD. 
Study AR-13324-CS202 compared Netarsudil 0.02%, and Netarsudil 0.01% with latanoprost 0.002% in 
a non-inferiority study. The primary endpoint was the mean diurnal IOP across subjects within treatment 
groups at Day 28 in the modified intent to treat population (all randomised subjects who received at least 
one dose of study medication and had all 3 baseline measurements along with at least one post-treatment 
time specific measurement).  
Latanoprost showed greater efficacy in reducing mean diurnal IOP from baseline at D28 and reduction of 
mean IOP from baseline at D 28 at all-time points than either netarsudil dose strength. Of the two 
netarsudil products netarsudil 0.02% showed marginally greater reduction in mean diurnal IOP at D28 
and marginally greater reduction in mean IOP at 2 of 3 time points on D28 compared to netarsudil 0.01%. 
Neither netarsudil product demonstrated non-inferiority to latanoprost.

Study AR-13324-CS302 had markedly different inclusion/exclusion criteria for baseline IOP compared to 
the two phase II studies. All participants were required to have a baseline IOP < 27mmHg compared to 
36mmHg in the phase II studies. In this study BID and OD doses of netarsudil 0.02% were compared with 
Timolol 0.5%. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was changed during the course of the study and the ultimate primary 
endpoint was mean IOP for patients with baseline IOP > 20mmHg (0:800 hrs) and < 25mmHg at (08:00, 
10:00 and 16:00 hrs) in the study eye at the following timepoints: 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours at 
Weeks 2 and 6, and Month 3 as opposed to a similar endpoint in those with a maximum baseline IOP of 
< 27 mmHg.  
All treatment groups showed a reduction in IOP by D15 which was sustained to 3 months (Table 13). At 
most time points Netarsudil 0.02% bid showed greater efficacy numerically than Timolol in the per 
protocol population with IOP < 25mmHg. This was not the case for the QD dose. However, both doses 
were non-inferior to Timolol (Table 14). The upper 95% confidence limit for the differences in mean IOP 
between netarsudil QD and timolol was within 1.5mmHg at all time points and within 1.00mmHg at 6 of 
9 time points. Discontinuation rates were considerably higher for Netarsudil 0.02% BD (39.8%), than 
Netarsudil 0.02% OD (18.3%) and Timolol (5.6%) at 3 months in the randomised population. This is the 
likely reason why the Netarsudil 0.02% was chosen for further evaluation even though there was an 
indication of greater efficacy with a BID dose. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
AR-13324-CS304 
A double-masked, randomized, multi-center, active-controlled, parallel group, 6-month study with a 
3-month interim analysis assessing the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of AR-13324 Ophthalmic 
Solution 0.02% QD compared to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% BID in patients with elevated 
intraocular pressure. RhoKinase elevated Intraocular Pressure Treatment Trial (ROCKET 4) 
Methods 
Study Participants 
This non-inferiority study was conducted in adults with a diagnosis of open angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension in both eyes (subjects could have had OAG in one eye and OHT in the other). 
Subjects had to meet the following IOP thresholds for inclusion: Un-medicated (post-washout) IOP > 
20mmHg and < 30mmHg in one or both eyes at 2 qualification visits at 08:00 hrs, 2-7 days apart and 
IOP>17mmHg and <30mmHg in one or both eyes at 10:00 and 16:00 hours on the second qualification 
visit. For inclusion the same eye must qualify at all qualification visits. Best corrected visual acuity in each 
eye had to be +1.0 logMAR or better by ETDRS chart or its equivalent in each eye. 
There were a number of exclusion criteria including: previous glaucoma surgery; pseudoexfoliation or 
pigment dispersion component glaucoma; history of closed angle glaucoma; use of more than 2 ocular 
hypotensive agents within 30 days of screening; refractive surgery; ocular trauma within 6 months prior 
to screening; ocular surgery within 3 months prior to screening; mean central corneal thickness > 620µm 
in either eye at screening; any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry; and known 
hypersensitivity to any of the components in the formulations to be used in the trial. There were also a 
number of appropriate systemic exclusions. 
The study was conducted at 52 clinical sites in the US.

The applicant has stated that the dose chosen for this study was based on the results of the dose finding 
study AR-13324-CS202 (note in that study the comparator was latanoprost rather than timolol).  
The treatments administered in this study were Netarsudil 0.02% QD and the active comparator Timolol 
maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% administered BID.  
As the treatment was double masked subjects in the netarsudil group instilled one drop of netarsudil 
placebo in the morning (between 7:30 and 8:30am) and one drop of netarsudil in the evening (between 
20:00 and 22:00 hours). Subjects assigned to the timolol arm instilled timolol maleate ophthalmic 
solution for morning and evening doses. 
Netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% used in this study is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution 
containing netarsudil (0.02%), boric acid, mannitol, Water for Injection, and preserved with 
benzalkonium chloride (0.015%). The product formulation is adjusted to approximately pH 5. Lot 
Numbers 228501 and 242811 were used during the 6-month study.  
Netarsudil placebo was an identical formulation, but lacking the active ingredient, netarsudil (Lot Number 
230271).  
Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% was supplied as a commercially-available generic product, 
presented as a sterile, isotonic, buffered, aqueous solution. Each ml contains 5 mg of timolol (6.8 mg of 
timolol maleate). Inactive ingredients are monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate, sodium hydroxide to 
adjust pH, and Water for Injection. Benzalkonium chloride 0.01% is included as a preservative. Timolol 
Lot Numbers 229526F, 233643F, 246026F and 261895F were used throughout the study. 
Objectives 
The overall objective was to evaluate the efficacy (primary endpoint at Month 3) and safety of netarsudil 
0.02% dosed QD compared to timolol maleate ophthalmic solution dosed bid. 
A 3-month interim analysis was conducted to evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of 
netarsudil 0.02% compared to timolol 0.5% over a 3 month period.  
The primary null hypothesis for the study was as follows: The difference between study eyes treated with 
netarsudil 0.02% QD and study eyes treated with timolol 0.5% (netarsudil OD minus timolol BID) in 
subjects whose study eyes have maximum baseline IOP < 25 mmHg, in the mean IOP at the following 
time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is > 1.5 mmHg for at 
least one time point over all visits or is > 1.0 mmHg for a majority of time points over all visits. 
The study would be considered a success if the null hypothesis was rejected. 
The applicant has not provided any justification for the non-inferiority margins used. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome was the mean IOP for subjects with baseline IOP < 25 mmHg in the study 
eye at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 
visits. An interim analysis of these efficacy endpoints was conducted when all subjects had completed 3 
months of treatment or discontinued from the study. 
Intraocular pressure was measured by qualified individuals using a calibrated Goldmann applanation 
tonometer. Local aneasthetic was applied to facilitate IOP measurements. Two consecutive IOP 
measurements of each eye were obtained. If the 2 measurements differed by more than 2 mmHg, a third 
measurement was taken. IOP was analysed as the mean of 2 measurements or as the median of 3 
measurements. Each Goldmann tonometry value was read as an integer. When calculating the mean or 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

median, it was possible to have a fractional value; for purposes of qualification, the number was to be 
rounded up.  
The unit of analysis for efficacy was the study eye. If the subject qualified in both eyes, the study eye was 
to be the eye with the higher IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3. If both eyes had the same IOP at 08:00 hours 
on Visit 3, the right eye was to be designated the study eye.The secondary endpoints were as follows: 
Mean IOP at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Day 15 (Week 2), Day 43 
(Week 6), and Day 90 (Month 3) Visits in subjects entering the trial with maximum baseline IOP < 26 
mmHg and < 27 mmHg (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) in the study eye, and in all subjects regardless 
of study eye IOP. 
Additionally, the following endpoints were summarized for both populations of subjects (i.e., including 
maximum baseline IOP < 25 mmHg and < 27 mmHg):  
•  Mean change from baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point  
•  Mean percent change from diurnally-adjusted baseline IOP at each time point  
•  Mean diurnal and change from baseline diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit 
Sample size 
Assuming zero difference between netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% QD and timolol maleate 
ophthalmic solution 0.5% BID, a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05 at each of 9 time points, a common SD of 2.75 
mmHg, and a correlation between time points of 0.60 or less, 140 PP subjects per arm with baseline IOP 
< 25 mmHg were necessary to have 90% power to show clinical non-inferiority of netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution 0.02% QD to timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% BID in the mean IOP.  
Clinical non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CIs around the difference (netarsudil 
- timolol) was within 1.5 mmHg at all time points and was within 1.0 mmHg at a majority of the time 
points. Power increases as the correlation among time points increases. Assuming 80% of enrolled 
subjects completed through Month 3 (the primary efficacy time point) without a major protocol deviation, 
approximately 175 subjects per arm (350 subjects total) with maximum baseline IOP <25 mmHg were to 
be randomized. Additionally, assuming that approximately 50% of randomized subjects had baseline IOP 
<25 mmHg, an estimated 350 subjects were to be randomized per arm for a total of approximately 700 
subjects randomized. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
A randomization code for allocating the treatments was prepared by an independent biostatistician who 
was not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive netarsudil 0.02% or timolol 0.5%, stratified by Investigative site and maximum baseline IOP < 25 
mmHg and ≥ 25 mmHg.  
The container-closure system used for netarsudil and placebo was chosen to be similar to the timolol 
commercial product presentation including the use of a yellow cap for netarsudil bottles to match the 
timolol cap colour. The labels from the commercial bottles of timolol were removed and the product 
bottles were labelled with investigational labels with the study salient information. 
The product for each individual treatment assignment was packaged into identical subject kits and each 
subject kit contained 2 bottles selected from one of the following IPs:  
•  Netarsudil ophthalmic solution placebo (labeled “AM”) and netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% 
(labeled “PM”)  
• 
Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% (labeled “AM”) and timolol maleate ophthalmic 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
  
solution 0.5% (labeled “PM”) 
To assist the subject in selecting the correct bottle for AM and PM dosing, the bottle labels were 
colour-coded to suitably distinguish the bottles for AM and PM dosing and also included “AM” or “PM” in 
clearly legible font size. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The primary subset of subjects to be analyzed was to include those subjects with maximum Day 1 IOP < 
25 mmHg at all 3 time points. Secondary analysis will be completed on all subjects enrolled in the trial. 
Randomized Population 
The randomized population was to include all subjects who were randomized to treatment. Baseline 
variables and demographic characteristics were to be summarized for this population. 
Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) 
The ITT population was to include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication. This population was to be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables and was to 
summarize subjects as randomized. 
Per-protocol Population (PP) 
The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which was to include those subjects (and their visits) 
who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study as 
judged by a masked evaluation prior to the unmasking of the study treatment. This population was to be 
used to summarize all efficacy variables. If the PP and ITT populations were exactly the same, then 
additional efficacy analyses on the ITT population were not to be performed. The PP population was to 
summarize subjects as treated. 
Safety Population 
The safety population was to include all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of 
study medication. This population will be used to summarize safety variables and will summarize 
subjects as treated. 
Separate analysis populations were to be defined for the 0-2 year old subjects and the 18 years and older 
subjects. 
Assessment of Protocol Deviation 
Protocol deviations were to be evaluated for all subjects in the safety population. Major protocol 
violations were to be judged by a masked evaluation and summarized in writing prior to the unmasking 
of the study treatment, for the purpose of selecting the PP population. 
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Any missing, unused, or spurious data were to be noted in the final statistical report. Randomization was 
to occur until approximately 350 total subjects with maximum baseline IOP < 25 mmHg have been 
randomized. Assuming that approximately 50% of randomized subjects will have baseline IOP < 25 
mmHg, an estimated 350 subjects will be randomized per arm for a total of 700 subjects randomized. 
Analyses were to be performed primarily on observed data only (without imputation) and secondarily 
using:

last observation carried forward (LOCF) where LOCF will be performed using time-relevant 
measures (i.e. from the same time point of the most recent visit with a nonmissing value) 
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) using time-relevant measures 
•  multiple imputation analyses under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. 
Analysis Methods 
All primary and secondary efficacy variables, along with the planned analysis methods for those variables, 
are given in the table below. These analyses were to be performed for the ITT and PP populations. The PP 
population was to be used for all efficacy subgroup analyses. 
The primary analysis of the primary outcome was to be completed using a two-sample 95% t-distribution 
confidence interval for the comparison of AR-13324 QD to timolol at each time point (08:00, 10:00, and 
16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits) using the per protocol population with maximum 
baseline IOP < 25 mmHg (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) in the study eye. The study was to be 
considered a success and clinical non-inferiority of AR-13324 QD concluded if the upper limit of the 95% 
CIs around the difference (AR-13324 QD – timolol) is below 1.5 mmHg at all time points through Month 
3 and is below 1.0 mmHg at a majority of the time points (at least 5 of 9) through Month 3. 
The secondary efficacy analyses were to include repeating the primary efficacy analysis on all subjects 
and additional analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint as well as other analyses of the secondary 
endpoints. 
The primary efficacy analysis was to be repeated on the PP population using observed data for study eyes 
with maximum baseline IOP <25 mm Hg, < 22 mm Hg, < 24 mm Hg, <26 mm Hg, <27 mm Hg, and 28 
mmHg. 
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint were to employ a linear model with IOP at the given visit and 
time point as the response, baseline IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, using the 
per protocol population. Baseline IOP was defined as the last non-missing measure at the corresponding 
time point prior to treatment. The least squares mean differences between AR-13324 and timolol was to 
be presented as well as the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and p-values. 
Similar analyses were to be completed using the PP and ITT populations with observed data only on the 
secondary endpoints. 
Additionally, for the individual IOP values at each time point and their changes from baseline values, 
mixed model repeated measures were to be run with baseline as the covariate; treatment, visit, time 
point, treatment by visit, treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point 
as the fixed effect factors; and subject as the random effect, repeated measure. 
An unstructured covariance structure was to be used to model the within subject, between visit and time 
point variances. This model was to be run including the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 visits on the PP and 
ITT populations with observed data only. Proc MIXED will be used in SAS and the outputs were to include 
the following: LS Mean (SE) for each treatment at each visit and time point, differences in LS Mean (SE) 
between the AR-13324 treatment group and the Timolol treatment group and 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals and p-values for the differences.

Table 6 - Summary of efficacy variables and analysis methods 
Subgroup analyses 
Sub-group analyses based upon pre-study characteristics such as unmedicated baseline IOP, iris colour, 
pre-study ocular hypotensive medications, age category (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), gender, and 
ethnicity  category (caucasian versus all other) were to be completed for subjects with maximum 
baseline IOP <25 mmHg and for all subjects to further investigate the efficacy measures. 
For all subgroups, except those defined by unmedicated baseline IOP, IOP was to be compared at each 
post-dose time point between treatment groups within subgroups using an ANCOVA model with 
treatment as the main effect, baseline IOP and subgroup as covariates, and the interaction of treatment 
and subgroup. T-tests from the model were to be performed to test for a difference in treatment group 
LS means between AR-13324 and timolol within each subgroup and post-dose time point. 
Iris colour was to be analyzed categorically using the following grouping: Brown/Black, Hazel, 
Blue/Grey/Green, Other. Pre-study hypotensive medication categories included in the subgroup analysis 
were Combination Therapy, Prostaglandins (monotherapy), Other (monotherapy) (including: 
β-adrenoceptor antagonists, Adrenergic agonists, Muscarinic agonists or Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), 
and No Prior Therapy. A separate subgroup analysis was to be completed on pre-study hypotensive 
medication categories: prior prostaglandin therapy and no prior prostaglandin therapy. Statistical 
inference was not made on any subgroups groups with fewer than six subjects. 
Multicenter Studies 
This study was anticipated to have approximately 40 different sites enrolling and treating subjects. The 
homogeneity of treatment effect across investigative sites was to be examined by a model containing the 
additional factors of investigative site and its interaction with treatment for the primary IOP efficacy 
endpoint. Sites with fewer than nine subjects were to be pooled together for the analysis.

Results 
Study Participant flow is shown in Table 11 for all subjects and those with IOP < 25mmHg. 
The applicant has not provided any information on the number of persons screened for the study. 
Completion rates were considerably higher in the Timolol arm (88% v 69.2%) all subjects and in the 
population with IOP < 25mmHg (90% v 74.8%) 
Major protocol deviation rates were similar in both treatment arms in the overall population (13.1% and 
12%) and those with IOP < 25mmHg (13.6% and 11%) for netarsudil and timolol respectively.

Recruitment 
The first subject was screened on 28 August 2015 and the last subject completed on 16 December 2016. 
The protocol was dated 15 July 2015. 
Sixty-three clinical sites in the US had agreed to participate in the study of which 52 enrolled study 
participants.  
Conduct of the study 
The applicant has stated that there were no protocol amendments over the course of the study 
Baseline data 
Baseline data for the whole study population and those with IOP < 25mmHg are summarised in the Table 
12. 
Both treatment groups were broadly similar in the IOP < 25mmHg population. There was a slightly higher 
proportion of males in the netarsudil group compared to timolol and median time since diagnosis was also 
higher in the netarsudil group. A broadly similar picture was seen in the ‘All’ subjects population. The 
median age was similar across all treatment groups in both populations. 
There were no differences by treatment group in either the ‘All’ or < 25mmHg populations in terms of 
prior ocular hypertension therapy. Roughly 37% had no prior treatment and approximately 47% had been 
treated with a prostaglandin monotherapy.

Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis was conducted in the per protocol population with an IOP < 25mmHg (n = 186 in 
each treatment arm). 
Analysis of the per protocol population for the primary efficacy endpoint in a non-inferiority study is 
acceptable.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis (Month 3, PP Population with Maximum Baseline IOP < 25 mmHg).  
Both treatment arms showed reduction in IOP at all-time points on day 15. These reductions were 
sustained to day 90 (See Table 13 and Figure 4). Differences from baseline ranged from 3.88 mmHg to 
4.74 mmHg for Netarsudil and 3.77 to 5.17 mmHg for timolol. 
Differences in actual reduction from baseline were somewhat greater for Timolol 0.5% bid at 5 time 
points, about the same for 2 time points and greater for Netarsudil 0.02% at 2 time points.

Though no evaluation of efficacy beyond 3 months was undertaken, reduction is IOP were maintained up 
to 6 months in both treatment arms (Figure 4).

Differences in reduction of IOP between treatment arms ranged from -0.6 mmHg to +0.56mmHg (See 
Table 14). The upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals for the difference in IOP reduction between 
Netarsudil 0.02% and Timolol 0.5% was < 1.5 mmHg at all time points and < 1 mmHg at 8 out of 9 
timepoints thereby demonstrating non-inferiority of Netarsudil 0.02% QD to Timolol 0.5% BID.

An analysis of the same endpoint as the primary endpoint in the PP population with baseline IOP 
<26mmgHg, with baseline IOP < 27mmHg, with baseline IOP < 28 mmHg and all subjects with baseline 
IOP < 30mmHg was conducted.  The Mean IOP difference from Timolol is summarised in Table 15 for each

Decrease from baseline was numerically greater in the Timolol 0.5% arm at 7 out of 9 time points. At one 
time point the upper limit for the 95% confidence interval mean IOP difference between Netarsudil 0.02% 
and Timolol 0.5% at 1.52 (above 1.5), therefore non-inferiority to Timolol 0.5% cannot be concluded.

Decrease from baseline was numerically greater in the Timolol 0.5% arm at 7 out of 9 time points. At one 
time point the upper limit for the 95% confidence interval mean IOP difference between Netarsudil 0.02% 
and Timolol 0.5% at 1.52 (above 1.5), therefore non-inferiority to Timolol 0.5% cannot be concluded (see 
following Table).

Difference from Timolol 0.5% and two-sided CIs and p-values are based on 2-sample t-tests comparing Netarsudil 
0.02% QD vs Timolol 0.5%. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled data showing mean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline are presented for the netarsudil QD arm 
from Phase 3 efficacy studies conducted as part of the Rhokiinsa development program versus the active 
comparator timolol. Supportive pooled data are also presented for the netarsudil QD arm from the Phase 
3 studies conducted as part of the fixed dose combination (PG324) development program versus the 
active comparator latanoprost (Table 7). 
The pooled data from the AR-13324 studies show that the IOP-lowering effect of netarsudil ranged from 
-4.05 to -4.57 mmHg (per protocol group) in subjects with baseline pressures <25 mmHg and from -3.71 
to -4.71 mmHg in subjects with baseline pressures ≥25 and <30 mmHg. Therefore, netarsudil was 
similarly effective at lowering IOP in subjects with higher baseline pressures compared to those with lower 
baseline pressures. In contrast, the IOP-lowering efficacy of timolol was more dependent upon baseline 
IOP, ranging from -4.31 to -4.36 mmHg (per protocol group) in subjects with baseline pressures <25 
mmHg and from -5.24 to -5.36 mmHg in subjects with baseline pressures ≥25 and <30 mmHg.   
Similar results were obtained in the supportive PG324 studies regarding the ability of netarsudil to 
produce similar IOP-lowering efficacy in subjects with higher baseline pressures as in subjects with lower 
baseline pressures. In the PG324 studies, the IOP-lowering effect of netarsudil ranged from -4.97 to -5.32 
mmHg (PP group) in subjects with baseline pressures <25 mmHg and from -4.87 to -5.50 mmHg in 
subjects with baseline pressures ≥25 and <30 mmHg. In subjects with baseline pressures ≥30 to <36 
mmHg, netarsudil produced somewhat larger IOP reductions, ranging from -5.74 to -6.35 mmHg. IOP 
reduction for latanoprost, like timolol, was more dependent upon baseline IOP, ranging from -5.24 to

-5.51 mmHg (PP group) in subjects with baseline pressures <25 mmHg, from -6.49 to -6.69 mmHg in 
subjects with baseline pressures ≥25 and <30 mmHg, and from -8.48 to -9.20 mmHg in subjects with 
baseline pressures ≥30 to <36 mmHg. Therefore, netarsudil’s IOP-lowering effect was similar to that of 
latanoprost in subjects with baseline pressures < 25mm Hg but not those with higher pressures. 
The relationship between baseline IOP and the IOP-lowering effect of timolol and latanoprost observed in 
the AR-13324 and PG324 studies, respectively, has been previously reported (e.g. Hedman 2000).

Another analysis from the AR-13324 Phase 3 efficacy studies of the IOP-lowering effect of netarsudil 
compared to timolol and its relationship to baseline IOP is presented in figure 5.  The sub-populations 
presented differ by the upper limit of baseline IOP allowed in each population, ranging from <27 mmHg 
(the upper limit in the AR-13324-CS301 and -CS302 studies) to <22 mmHg.  While the IOP-lowering 
effect of netarsudil was stable (approximately 4 mmHg) across the full range of baseline pressures, the 
efficacy observed with timolol was highest in the sub-population with the highest baseline pressures and 
it became progressively diminished at lower baseline pressures.  As a result, netarsudil was slightly 
more effective than timolol in the lowest baseline group and slightly less effective than timolol in the 
highest baseline group. 
Figure 3 - Intraocular Pressure-Lowering Efficacy Across a Range of Baseline Pressures - 
Pooled AR-13324 Data; Change from Baseline at Day 90 in Mean Diurnal IOP 
The data from the AR-13324 Phase 3 studies and the supporting PG324 studies demonstrate that 
netarsudil effectively lowers mean diurnal IOP by approximately 4 to 6 mmHg in subjects with baseline 
pressures ≥25 to <36 mmHg.  While the magnitude of the IOP-lowering effect of netarsudil was not as 
great as that observed with timolol or latanoprost treatment in subjects with baseline IOPs ≥25 mmHg, it

was nevertheless still effective at reducing elevated IOP by a clinically-significant amount. 
Even though the mean reduction in IOP between the netarsudil and timolol groups favours timolol at 
baseline pressures >25 mmHg, the distribution of IOP reductions achieved by individual subjects is highly 
overlapping for the two treatments. Figure 5 presents a Scatter Plot of individual subject data across the 
pooled Phase 3 studies grouped by baseline IOP. It shows that a similar range of reductions in mean 
diurnal IOP for netarsudil and timolol for subjects with baseline pressures between 25 and 30 mmHg were 
observed.  However, there are proportionally more non-responder subjects (defined as mean diurnal IOP 
reduction < 2 mmHg) in the netarsudil group relative to the timolol group in this higher-baseline 
population, which at the population level produces a smaller mean IOP reduction for netarsudil compared 
to timolol.  This does not negate the fact a large proportion of subjects achieved clinically-significant 
reductions in IOP with netarsudil as well as with timolol. 
The scatter plot of individual responses in subjects with baseline pressures between 25 and 30 mmHg is 
relevant to the practice of medicine.  At these high baseline IOPs, subjects are likely to require IOP 
reductions of 7 to 10 mmHg to reach target pressure based upon recommendations in the European 
Glaucoma Society Guidelines 4th Edition (EGS 2014).  The scatter plot suggests that both netarsudil and 
timolol have the potential to achieve this level of IOP reduction as monotherapy, but only for a minority of 
subjects.  In practice, these high baseline patients are most likely to start on a prostaglandin medication 
as first line therapy, and timolol or netarsudil would be added as an adjunctive medication if monotherapy 
proved insufficient to reach the patient’s target pressure (as expected for at least half of these 
high-baseline subjects, Schmier 2014).  In other words, netarsudil is most likely to be used as an 
adjunctive medication in patients with high baseline IOPs.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were conducted in special populations. This is acceptable. 
Supportive study 
AR-13324-CS301. A double-masked, randomized, multi-center, active-controlled, parallel, 
3-month study assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of AR-13324 Ophthalmic 
Solution, 0.02% compared to timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5% in patients with 
elevated intraocular pressure. 
The study was conducted at 35 sites in the US and was run in parallel with AR-13324-CS302. The study 
was initiated on 11 June 2014 and completed on 4 March 2015. 
The inclusion criteria were the same as those for Study CS-302. Adults aged 18 or over and children age 
0 to 2 years were eligible for recruitment. To be eligible subjects had to have a diagnosis of open angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes. It was acceptable to have OHT in one eye and OAG in the 
other. For adults the un-medicated IOP should be > 20mmHg and < 27mmHg in the study eye at 2 
qualification visits (08:00hrs), 2-7 days apart and > 17mmHg and < 27mmHg at the second qualification 
visit at 10:00 and 16:00 hrs (in the same eye).  
The efficacy objective of the study was to evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of Netarsudil 0.02% 
ophthalmic solution QD, in both eyes, compared to timolol maleate 0.5% ophthalmic solution BID. 
The primary efficacy outcome was to be the mean IOP at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at Days 15, 43 
and 90. 
Clinical non-inferiority was to be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the 
difference (Netarsudil 0.02% - timolol) was within 1.5mmHg at all time points and was within 1.0 mmHg 
at, at least 5 of 9 time points. 
The unit of analysis for efficacy was the study eye. If a subject qualified in both eyes the study eye was the 
eye with the higher IOP at 08:00 hours at Visit 3. If both eyes had the same IOP on that date the right eye 
was designated the study eye. 
Intraocular pressure was to be measured by qualified personnel using a calibrated Golmann applanation 
tonometer after application of local anaesthetic. Two consecutive measures were to be taken. If they 
differed by more than 2 mmHg, a third measurement was to be obtained. IOP was to be analysed as the 
mean of 2 measurements or the median of 3.

Like the other netarsudil studies where timolol was the active comparator discontinuation rates were 
higher in the netarsudil arm. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar across the groups. 
Efficacy results 
At D15 at all time points both treatment groups showed reductions from baseline in mean IOP which were 
maintained to D90. These reductions were all statistically significant (See Table 25).   
The upper 95% confidence limit for the difference in mean IOP in the per protocol study population 
(maximum baseline IOP < 27mmHg) was greater than 1.5mmHg for 3 of time points and greater than 
1mmHg for 5 of 9 time points, therefore Netarsudil 0.02% did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority to 
Timolol 0.5%. 
The applicant conducted a pre-specified analysis in the PP population with IOP < 23mHg which did 
demonstrate non-inferiority to timolol. A further post hoc analysis in in the PP population with baseline 
IOP < 25mmHg did demonstrate non-inferiority to timolol.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has sought a broad indication for Rhokiinsa (netarsudil 0.02%) in the treatment of ocular 
hypertension and open angle glaucoma. In support of the indication the applicant submitted five studies. 
All studies were randomised and, apart from one phase II study, had an active control arm. All of the 
active controlled studies were non-inferiority studies.

To participate in the studies all subjects had to have a diagnosis of ocular hypertension or open angle 
glaucoma. 
Of the five studies three were open to adults only. CS301 and CS302 were open to children under two 
years of age as well as adults. No children were recruited to CS301 and two children to CS302. 
All studies excluded patients with glaucoma with pseudo-exfoliation or pigment dispersion component, 
and a history of acute angle closure or narrow angle. 
Inclusion criteria with regard to IOP were different across studies, with the most marked difference 
between the two earliest studies (CS201 and CS202) and the later three studies. The first two studies had 
an upper limit for post-washout IOP of < 36mmHg, whereas later studies had an upper limit of < 27mmHg 
(CS 301, CS302) and 30mmHg (CS304). In addition, the lower limit of IOP was lower in the CS 301, 302 
and 304 compared to CS201 and 202. In other words, the later studies recruited a population with less 
severe ocular hypertension. This change would appear to have been driven by the results of earlier 
studies. It must be noted that the population included in the three later studies does not reflect the total 
population for which the indication is sought. 
The active comparator was latanoprost in the earliest comparator study (CS202).  This was appropriate 
given that prostaglandins are the most widely used therapy for open angle glaucoma and raised 
intraocular pressure and in the pivotal study approximately 47% of participants had received prior 
monotherapy with prosataglandins. It should be noted that neither Netarsudil 0.01% nor Netarsudil 
0.02% demonstrated non-inferiority to Latanoprost.  
The use of timolol as comparator in the phase III non-inferiority studies and in particular the pivotal study 
(CS304) is questioned given that prostaglandins are the first line topical IOP lowering therapy and there 
is some evidence that timolol may have less efficacy than latanoprost (Li T et al. Ophthalmology 2016; 
British Journal of Ophthalmology 2017).   
The primary endpoint in the pivotal study (CS304) was non-inferiority of netarsudil 0.02% QD to timolol 
0.5% BID for subjects entering the study with maximum baseline IOP <25 mmHg (08:00, 10:00, and 
16:00 hrs) in the study eye, with a non-inferiority limit of 1.5 mmHg at all-time points from Day 15 to Day 
90 at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hrs at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 visits.  
Non-inferiority of netarsudil to timolol was to be demonstrated if the upper 95% confidence limit for the 
differences in mean IOP (reduction from baseline) between netarsudil and timolol was within 1.5mmHg at 
all 9 time points and within 1.0 mmHg at the majority of time points (5/9). 
The same endpoint in the total per protocol population (maximum baseline IOP < 30 mmHg) was a 
secondary endpoint. 
The primary endpoint was evaluated in the per protocol population with a maximum baseline IOP of < 25 
mmHg. The end point of reduction in IOP is acceptable given that the aim of treatment with anti-glaucoma 
medication is reduction in IOP and there is evidence that reduction of IOP delays progression of glaucoma. 
4 
The non-inferiority design of the comparative studies was appropriate. In all of the studies the 
non-inferiority margin was 1.5mmHg. The applicant’s clinical justification of the non-inferiority margin is 
based on an appeal to published literature and CHMP Scientific Advice and can be accepted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Three studies were performed that could be considered to be dose finding studies. A comparison of three 
dose strength (0.01%, 0.02% and 0.04% QD) with study duration of eight days showed that netarsudil 
0.02% and 0.04% showed similar reductions in IOP three time points on D8 with the data suggesting that 
the top of the dose response curve was reached at 0.02% dosed once a day. A further study comparing

a QD and BID dose of netarsudil 0.02% demonstrated greater efficacy for the BID dose but at the expense 
of a higher rate of adverse events and lower completion rates. Thus the choice of dose for the pivotal 
study has been informed by a trade-off between efficacy and adverse events that could interfere with 
patient’s concordance with therapy. 
In the pivotal study both timolol and netarsudil reduced baseline IOP at all time points in both PP and ITT 
populations with maximum IOP < 25mmHg and the total PP and ITT populations with IOP < 30mmHg. In 
the ITT population with maximum IOP < 25mmHg reductions in baseline IOP at across the 9 time points 
for netarsudil ranged from -3.71 to -4.87mmHg and from -3.81 to -5.18 mmHg for timolol.  In the all 
subjects (maximum IOP < 30mmHg) ITT population reductions in IOP from baseline at the 9 time points 
ranged from -3.78 to – 4.83 mmHg for netarsudil and from -4.25 to -5.57mmH for timolol. 
A beneficial effect was demonstrated only in a limited, milder population in the pivotal study (CS304), i.e. 
the primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension population with a baseline IOP > 17mmHg and 
< 25mmHg. Non-inferiority compared to timolol was not demonstrated in the overall study population 
(baseline IOP < 30mmHg). This reflects the findings of earlier studies where the efficacy of netarsudil 
appeared to be poorer in those with higher IOP compared to timolol. Those with an IOP ≥ 30mmHg were 
not reflected in any of the Phase 3 studies submitted to support the application. Therefore, the study 
population was not considered to be reflective of the overall population for which the claimed indication 
was sought. In addition, almost 40% of participants in both the < 25 mmHg and < 30mmHg populations 
had not been on any prior glaucoma therapy A potential extrapolation outside the study population was 
requested as well as well as summarised data comparing IOP reduction by netarsudil and comparators 
(ie. timolol and latanoprost) in those patients with a baseline IOP < 25mmHg, those with an IOP 
≥25mmHg and < 30mmHg and those with an IOP ≥30mmHg and < 36mmHg were also requested. 
To answer these concerns, the applicant stated that the range of baseline IOPs treated in CS-304 reflects 
the real world population of POAG and has supported this with data from the Baltimore Eye Survey (1991) 
which demonstrated that approximately 78% of those diagnosed in the study with POAG had a baseline 
IOP < 25mmHg (Sommer A et al 1991). This study was conducted in the US and the underlying 
demography of the study population was dissimilar to an average European population. Further data was 
provided from the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (conducted in Sweden), however the data provided by 
the applicant refers to the distribution of IOPs at screening only in those randomised to the subsequent 
trial rather than the range and distribution of IOPs in the complete screening population (Leske 1999). 
The fact that for other anti-glaucoma medication approved in the EU the study populations for registration 
studies reflected patients with higher baseline IOPs therefore necessitating an extrapolation of benefit to 
the patient group with lower IOPs who were not included in the studies is acknowledged.  
With regard to the population with an IOP > 30mmHg which were not included in any of the phase 3 trials 
the applicant claims that data from the Phase 2 studies and phase 3 studies with a fixed combination of 
netarsudil and latanoprost which compared the FDC to the individual components showed that  netarsudil 
produced a clinically-meaningful and statistically significant reduction in mean IOP from baseline in the 
full OAG/OHT study population in the phase 2 studies, with similar results seen in the phase 3 FDC 
studies.   
The pooled data from the AR-13324 studies show that netarsudil was similarly effective at lowering IOP in 
subjects with higher baseline pressures compared to those with lower baseline pressures. In contrast, the 
IOP-lowering efficacy of timolol was more dependent upon baseline IOP. Similar results were obtained in 
the supportive PG324 studies. 
The applicant has presented a scatter plot with pooled data from phase 3 netarsudil studies versus timolol 
showing change in IOP from baseline to D90 in the population with baseline IOP < 25mmHg and the 
Assessment report

population with IOP ≥25 mmHg and < 30 mmHg. There were higher non response rates (< 2mmHg 
reduction in IOP from baseline) in those treated with netarsudil in the higher baseline IOP group than in 
those treated with timolol. This would also appear to be the case for the < 25mmHg netarsudil population. 
The applicant asserts that this may be the reason why non-inferiority was not shown versus timolol in the 
≥25 mmHg and < 30 mmHg population. From the scatter plot it can be seen that some patients in the 
netarsudil group achieved quite large reductions in baseline IOP (-7 mm Hg or more) though not as many 
as those treated with timolol. Nevertheless, there is evidence of large reductions in baseline IOP in some 
patients treated with netarsudil with higher baseline IOPs. 
The applicant states that patients with baseline IOP ≥25mmHg are more likely to require more than 1 
therapy to achieve target reductions in IOP and that given the evidence from the fixed dose combination 
studies of netarsudil with latanoprost, netarsudil has demonstrated its efficacy in the adjunctive setting.  
In order to demonstrate non-inferiority, the upper bound of the 95% CI for the primary analysis using the 
two-sample t-test needed to be within 1.5mmHg at all 9 time points and within 1mmHg for 5 out of 9 time 
points. For one of the nine time points the upper 95% CI was 1.52 which is just outside the NI margin of 
1.5. Whilst this from a strictly statistical point of view makes netarsudil not non-inferior to timolol in the 
per-protocol population with an IOP < 30mmHg, it is of lesser importance from a clinical point of view.  It 
is also acknowledged that non-inferiority was demonstrated in the Per-Protocol population when using an 
ANCOVA model using treatment as a factor and baseline as a covariate. 
Overall it is acknowledged that netarsudil has demonstrated a similar degree of absolute IOP lowering in 
the population with IOP < 25mmHg, those with an IOP ≥25 and < 30 mmHg and those with an IOP ≥ 30 
and < 36 mmHg. However, comparators such as timolol and latanoprost tend to have a greater absolute 
effect at higher IOPs than at baseline IOPs < 25mmHg, hence the difficulty with demonstrating 
non-inferiority in the total population. The applicant has also postulated that an additional reason for not 
demonstrating non-inferiority may be due to a higher rate of non-responders in the netarsudil arm of the 
≥25 and < 30 mmHg population. In spite of not demonstrating non-inferiority in the total population in 
the pivotal study, pooled data from the phase 3 studies has demonstrated that some patients treated with 
netarsudil with baseline IOPs ≥25 and < 30 mmHg demonstrated quite large reductions in IOP (-7mmHg 
or more).  
In addition, the applicant has also agreed to include a table in section 5.1 of the SmPC showing change in 
IOP by treatment visit compared to timolol. This will allow prescribers to make a more informed decision 
with regard to use of netarsudil in this population and is endorsed. 
In contrast to several other approved glaucoma/OHT agents, patients with secondary OAG (e.g. 
pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion syndrome) were excluded from the pivotal studies. Considering 
(i) the proposed indication for use in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension; (ii) the 
mechanism of action of netarsudil as an enhancer of trabecular outflow facility; and (iii) the 
pathophysiology of elevated IOP in pseudoexfolation syndrome and pigment dispersion syndrome, 
inclusion of patients with secondary OAG was questioned. 
The applicant acknowledges that patients with secondary glaucoma were excluded from their registration 
studies. A number of registration studies for other anti-glaucoma products are cited in which the 
proportion of secondary glaucoma patients (pseudo-exfoliative or pigmentary glaucoma) included were 
too small to draw any conclusion regarding efficacy in this population. The applicant also provides some 
data on the use of netarsudil in 5 patients with secondary glaucoma (3 with pseudo-exfoliative glaucoma, 
one with pigmentary glaucoma and one with open angle glaucoma, who should not have been included as 
it appears she did not have a secondary glaucoma); only in this latter case was netarsudil used as a 
monotherapy.

The applicant also refers to data on other Rhokinase inhibitors (AR-12286) and ripasudil that have been 
shown to lower IOP in patients with secondary(pseudo-exfoliative) glaucoma as well as providing 
anecdotal reports from the USA in which physicians have prescribed netarsudil to their secondary 
glaucoma patients on (maximum- tolerated) therapy and have seen an additional IOP-lowering effect of 
adding netarsudil.  
The applicant states that there is pre-clinical evidence that netarsudil could be of benefit in secondary 
glaucoma (e.g. in vitro studies with netarsudil have demonstrated that it blocks the profibrotic effects of 
the cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), on human trabecular meshwork cells) as well as 
the clinical evidence regarding the mode of action of netarsudil (relaxes the tissues in the TM outflow 
pathway, including the episcleral veins, and thereby lowers IOP by reducing the resistance to aqueous 
outflow). Whilst this is accepted it is unclear to what extent netarsudil is likely to demonstrate an effect on 
the TM outflow tract which is in the case of pseudo-exfoliative or pigmentary secondary glaucoma could to 
be scarred as a consequence of secondary glaucoma and thus less capable of relaxing in response to 
netarsudil. 
The lack of data available is reflected in section 5.1. 
Even though it is acknowledged that patients with pseudo-exfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma 
frequently present late and have a rapid rate of progression and poorer prognosis, at the present time the 
evidence submitted by the applicant in support of the broader inclusion is very limited and is insufficient 
to support the inclusion of secondary glaucoma in the indication.  
Therefore, the final indication is: Rhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure 
(IOP) in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of Rhokiinsa (netarsudil) 0.02% QD (as in non-inferiority to timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 
0.5%) has been demonstrated in the pivotal study (CS304) population with a maximum baseline IOP < 
25mmHg. Non-inferiority was not demonstrated in the total study population with maximum baseline IOP 
< 30 mmHg. However, in spite of not demonstrating non-inferiority in the total population in the pivotal 
study, pooled data from the phase 3 studies has demonstrated that some patients treated with netarsudil 
with baseline IOPs ≥25 and < 30 mmHg demonstrated quite large reductions in IOP (-7mmHg or more). 
There is insufficient efficacy data to substantiate the inclusion of the secondary glaucoma such as 
pseudo-exfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma within the broad indication of open angle glaucoma and 
ocular hypertension. Therefore Rhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure 
(IOP) in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The development program conducted in support of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% comprises 10 
completed clinical studies (Phases 1 to 3). Characteristics of all the completed clinical studies are provided 
in  Table  1.  Three  studies  were  ongoing  at  the  data  lock  point  for  this  application  and  the  applicant 
provided an update on these studies in the responses to the day 120 LoQ. No new safety concerns arise 
from these studies. 
Overall, the safety analysis of Netarsadil ophthalmic solution 0.02% is based on the results obtained from 
the following data sources: 
•  7 prospective, randomized, double-masked, multi-centre, active or vehicle-controlled, parallel group

studies in subjects with OAG or OHT: 
i. 
Two Phase 2 studies (AR-13324-CS201 and AR-13324-CS202) were conducted to 
evaluate the dose-response and dosing regimen of netarsudil prior to initiation of the 
Phase 3 studies 
ii. 
iii. 
A third Phase 2 study (AR-13324-CS204) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 
netarsudil during nocturnal and diurnal periods.  
Four Phase 3 multi-centre, active-controlled studies (AR-13324-CS301, 
AR-13324-CS302, AR-13324-CS303, and AR-13324-CS304), of 3, 6 or 12 months 
duration, were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and ocular hypotensive 
efficacy of netarsudil.  
iv. 
In addition, two Phase 1 studies were completed in healthy subjects: a pharmacokinetics 
study to evaluate systemic plasma concentrations of netarsudil following ocular 
administration (AR-13324-CS101), and a mechanism of action study to evaluate the 
effect of netarsudil on aqueous humor dynamics (AR-13324-CS102). 
• 
A non-interventional Corneal Deposit Observational Study (AR-13324-OBS01) was completed in 
which visual function (e.g., visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, VF-14 Questionnaire) and corneal 
deposit resolution was evaluated in subjects who developed corneal deposits (cornea verticillata) 
or corneal opacity while participating in the Phase 3 studies AR-13324-CS301 or 
AR-13324-CS302. 
•  A follow-up Phase 2 mechanism of action study (AR-13324-CS206) has been initiated in subjects with 
OAG or OHT, and in support of product development in Japan, a Phase 1 study (AR-13324-CS104) 
and a Phase 2 study (AR-13324-CS205) have also been initiated. 
•  An overview of supportive safety data from studies conducted as part of the parallel clinical 
development programme for PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, a fixed-dose combination of netarsudil 
0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% has also been provided. 
The most relevant safety information was obtained in the Phase 2 and 3 studies since these studies were 
randomized, double-masked, and active or vehicle-controlled and conducted in the patient population 
(OAG and OHT) for which the product is intended, whereas the Phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy 
subjects. 
The description of safety will thus focus primarily on the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.  
Patient exposure 
In the netarsudil 0.02% development program a total of 1,258 subjects were treated with netarsudil 
0.02% (once daily or QD: 969 subjects; twice daily or BID: 289 subjects), the concentration for which this 
application seeks approval.   
Number of subjects exposed to netarsudil ophthalmic solution are presented across both Netarsudil and 
PG324 (FDC with 0.005% lantanoprost) development programs below. 
When combined with the PG324 development program a total of 3,454 subjects were randomized to 
therapy across all treatment groups (netarsudil and comparators) in completed trials, which included 501 
subjects in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and 2,953 subjects in the Phase 3 studies.  
This included a total of 1,950 subjects across all concentrations (0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.04%) of netarsudil 
with greater numbers in the Phase 3 studies (1,626 subjects) compared to the Phase 1 and 2 studies (324 
subjects).

Within the netarsudil 0.02% treatment group, 1,834 subjects were treated (QD: 1,545; or BID: 289).  
The active comparators in these studies included latanoprost 0.005% (638 subjects) and timolol 0.5% 
(Phase 3 only, 839 subjects). With the exception of a single study (AR-13324-CS202), latanoprost was 
used as a comparator only in the supportive PG324 studies.  An overview of subject exposure by study 
and treatment group is provided in Table below.

In several of the clinical studies, the dosage of netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution was administered 
topically as either a once daily or twice daily administration. There was an increased frequency of AEs with 
Netarsudil 0.02% when administered twice daily versus once daily. However, it is important to note that 
the currently proposed posology is Netarsudil 0.02% administered on a once daily dosing schedule and 
the twice daily posology is not being pursued. 
In this context, 969 patients were exposed to once daily dosing with Netarsudil 0.02% solution in the 
clinical development for the mono constituent product. 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
The demography of the overall study population is representative of those who would receive the product 
once marketed in Europe and is similar to that reported in clinical studies evaluating comparable products 
(Garway-Heath 2017, Goldberg 2014). 
The Phase 2 studies (other than AR-13324-CS204) included 309 randomized subjects ranging in age from 
19 to 90 years with a mean age across all studies ranging from 57.8 to 69.1 years.

Demographic characteristics for Phase 3 are presented for the pooled safety population. The pooled safety 
population from the 4 AR-13324 Phase 3 studies included 1967 randomized subjects ranging in age from 
11 to 96 years, with a mean age of 64.3 years. The proposed indication is for use in adult patients only. 
In patients treated with netarsudil 0.02% once daily, 55.8% of patients were ≥65 years, reflective of the 
target population. Paediatric patients under 18 years were not specifically studied. 
Most subjects were white (73.6%) and had brown/black irises (62.9%).  
The pooled population included a higher percentage of females (61.1%) compared to males (38.9%).  
A higher percentage of subjects had a study eye diagnosis of OAG (64.3 %) compared to OHT (35.7%). 
Overall, no clinically relevant differences were observed among the treatment groups across all studies in 
the assessment of demographic characteristics. The demographic profile of the pooled safety population 
from the AR-13324 Phase 3 studies is presented by study and treatment group in Table below. 
In addition to the populations already studied, clinical studies are currently ongoing in patients of 
Japanese ethnic origin.

Note: The pooled population includes subjects from the AR-13324-CS301, AR-13324-CS302, AR-13324-CS303 and 
AR-13324-CS304 clinical studies. 
Adverse events 
In the Phase 3 studies, the proportion of subjects treated with netarsudil experiencing an AE was higher 
than in the Phase 2 trials, reflective of the longer duration of treatment in these studies. 
The incidence of AEs in subjects receiving netarsudil 0.02% QD was generally consistent across the four 
Phase 3 studies, (with the exception of AR-13324-CS303 having a higher incidence), AR-13324-CS301, 
AR-13324-CS302,  AR-13324-CS303,  and  AR-13324-CS304:  81.2%  (165/203),  87.6%  (220/251), 
97.1% (33/34), 80.1% (281/351), respectively.

As noted in the Phase 2 studies, the large majority of the netarsudil QD AEs were ocular in nature, most 
were judged as treatment-related and most were of mild severity. 
In the 12-month AR-13324-CS302 and AR-13324-CS303 studies, a similar incidence of AEs was recorded 
for subjects receiving netarsudil BID, 88.9% (225/253) and 100% (36/36); however, the overall duration 
of dosing for netarsudil BID was shorter than for netarsudil QD due to its higher discontinuation rate due 
to  AEs  [BID:  53.8%  (136/253)  and  86.1%  (31/36)  vs.  QD:  30.3%  (76/251)  and  47.1%  (16/34), 
respectively].  
In  addition,  there  was  a  higher  incidence  of  subjects  with  AEs  scored  as  moderate  or  severe  in  the 
netarsudil BID group compared to the netarsudil QD group.  
In the Phase 3 studies, the incidence of AEs in subjects treated with netarsudil was higher than for those 
treated  with  timolol:  53.8%  (112/208),  63.3%  (159/251),  87.0%  (20/23),  and  60.2%  (215/357)  for 
timolol, respectively. 
With regard to the pooled Phase 3 population, of those subjects who experienced a TEAE, the majority in 
the netarsudil QD (58.5%; 409/699) and timolol (73.3%; 371/506) groups experienced TEAEs that were 
mild in intensity. 
A higher incidence of netarsudil BID subjects (46.4%; 121/261) experienced TEAEs of moderate intensity 
compared to netarsudil QD (35.2%; 246/699) and timolol (21.9%; 111/506) subjects.  
A higher proportion of subjects in the netarsudil groups (QD: 73.1%; BID: 84.1%) compared to those in 
the timolol group (42.3%) experienced AEs that were considered treatment related events. 
With respect to the subgroup analyses in the pooled Phase 3 population, whites had a higher incidence of 
both overall adverse events and ocular adverse events when compared to subjects of other ethnicities. 
The comparative incidences (white vs. other ethnicities) of ocular events were as follows: netarsudil QD 
(89.0 vs. 66.8%); netarsudil BID (93.8 vs. 80.8%); timolol (64.2 vs. 50.0%). An analysis of adverse 
event severity indicated that in the netarsudil treatment groups, white subjects had greater incidences of 
moderate and severe adverse events compared to subjects of other ethnicities.

Phase 3 Studies 
AEs reported in at least 2% of the pooled Phase 3 study population are discussed, except in the case of 
treatment-related non-ocular AEs which are reported in at least 1% of the pooled population. 
In the 4 Phase 3 studies, the most frequently reported ocular AEs in the netarsudil treatment groups were 
conjunctival hyperaemia, cornea verticillata and conjunctival haemorrhage (Table 31 and Table 32). The 
incidence  of  these  AEs  for  netarsudil  QD  was  lower  in  the  shorter  duration  studies  AR-13324-CS301 
(53.2% (108/203), 5.9% (12/203), 15.8% (32/203)) and AR-13324-CS304 (47.9% (168/351), 24.5% 
(86/351),  16.0%  (56/351))  than  in  the  longer  duration  studies  AR-13324-CS302  (60.6%  (152/251), 
25.5% (64/251), and 19.5% (49/251)), and AR-13324-CS303 (82.4% (28/34), 38.2% (13/34), 20.6% 
(7/34)),  respectively.  The  incidence  of  these  AEs  was  similar  for  netarsudil  BID  in  studies 
AR-13324-CS302 and AR-13324-CS303. 
For  the  large  majority  of  netarsudil  QD  and  BID  subjects  in  studies  AR-13324-CS302  and 
AR-13324-CS303 (both 12 months) who experienced conjunctival hyperaemia and completed the study, 
conjunctival hyperaemia was sporadic in nature (QD: 80.5% (66/82) and 78.6% (22/28) respectively; 
BID: 80.0% (44/55) and 82.4% (28/34)). 
In  addition,  only  28.3%  (43/152)  of  QD  subjects  and  25.0%  (42/168)  of  BID  subjects  in  the 
AR-13324-CS302  study  and  53.6%  (15/34)  QD  subjects  and  79.4%  (27/36)  BID  subjects)  in  the 
AR-13324-CS303 study had the event reported at >3 consecutive visits. 
The incidence of conjunctival hemorrhage across the four Phase 3 studies was higher in the netarsudil 
groups (QD: 15.8 to 20.6%; BID: 16.7 to 19.4%) compared to timolol (0.8 to 3.1%). When present, 
conjunctival hemorrhage was typically reported as mild and was considered treatment-related. 
Another frequently reported ocular AE (only reported in Phase 3 studies) was corneal deposits (cornea 
verticillata). The term “cornea verticillata” refers to a whorl-like pattern of deposits typically localized to 
the basal corneal epithelium (Mantyjarvi 1998; Hollander 2004). A variety of drugs that are both cationic 
and amphiphilic are known to induce cornea verticillata, which arise due to the lysosomal accumulation of 
phospholipids  within  corneal  epithelial  cells  through  a  process  called  phospholipidosis.  Netarsudil  is  a 
cationic  amphiphilic  drug and  Aerie  has  shown  that  netarsudil  can  induce  phospholipidosis  in  Chinese 
hamster ovary cells (AR-13324-IPH07), suggesting that the etiology of the netarsudil-induced corneal 
deposits is phospholipidosis. It is unusual for cornea verticillata to result in reduction of visual acuity or 
ocular symptoms and the deposits typically resolve with discontinuation of the drug (Mantyjarvi 1998). 
Cornea  verticillata  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  longer  6-  and  12-month  studies 
(AR-13324-CS302:  QD  25.5%,  BID  25.3%;  AR-13324-CS303:  QD  38.2%,  BID  38.9%;  and 
AR-13324-CS304: QD 24.5%) compared to the 3-month study (AR-13324-CS301 QD 5.9%).

In the timolol group, this event was only reported in Study AR-13324-CS302 at an incidence of 0.8% 
(Table 25). 
Aerie also conducted a Corneal Deposit Observation Study (AR-13324-OBS01) to further evaluate visual 
function in subjects who developed corneal deposits in the AR-13324-CS301 and -CS302 clinical studies. 
At  the  completion  of  the  observational  study,  there  was  no  clinically  meaningful  impact  of  cornea 
verticillata on  visual  function  as  measured  by  visual  acuity,  contrast  sensitivity,  and  a  visual  function 
questionnaire. The AE resolved in all but 3 subjects (4 eyes); in these 3 subjects the corneal deposit grade 
had  decreased  and  the  event  stabilized  by  the  completion  of  the  study  (Section  2.3).  After  study 
completion, cornea verticillata resolved in 1 of these subjects and had improved in the other 2 subjects (3 
out of 4 eyes). 
Other ocular AEs recorded for netarsudil across the four Phase 3 studies included: 
• 
• 
• 
Instillation site pain (QD: 14.8%, 17.9%, 26.5%, and 23.6%; BID: 17.8% and 22.2%),  
vision blurred (QD: 5.4%,10.8%, 5.9%, and 5.4%; BID: 17.4% and 13.9%) 
instillation site erythema (QD: 5.6%,11.8%, 5.9%, and 10.3%; BID: 12.6% and 5.6%).  
With the exception of instillation site pain, these same events were reported at much lower incidences in 
the  timolol  group  as  presented  in  Table  31.  An  evaluation  of  ocular  events  that  were  considered 
treatment-related provided very similar results as presented in Table 32. 
The most frequently reported (≥2%) ocular AEs in the pooled Phase 3 population is presented in Table 27.  
The most common ocular events reported for netarsudil included conjunctival hyperaemia (QD: 54.4%; 
BID: 69.9%), cornea verticillata (QD: 20.9%; BID: 27.0%), conjunctival hemorrhage (QD: 17.2; BID: 
19.0%), instillation site pain (QD: 19.9%; BID: 18.3%), vision blurred (QD: 7.4%; BID: 17.0%), and 
instillation site erythema (QD: 9.1%; BID: 11.8%).  
Less  common  events  included  vital  dye  staining  cornea  present  (QD:  9.4%;  BID:  8.7%),  lacrimation 
increased (QD: 7.2%; BID: 10.0%), erythema of eyelid (QD: 6.8%; BID: 7.6%), visual acuity reduced 
(QD: 5.2%; BID: 8.0%),  eye pruritus (QD: 4.1%; BID: 8.0%), conjunctival  edema (QD: 3.1%; BID: 
7.6%),  eye  irritation  (QD:  3.8%;  BID:  5.5%),  eyelid  edema  (QD:3.5%;BID:  6.6%),  foreign  body 
sensation in eyes (QD: 2.5%; BID: 6.2%), and corneal opacity (considered to be ‘cornea verticillata’) 
(QD: 1.3%; BID: 5.2%). 
These  same  events  were  all  reported  at  lower  incidences  in  the  timolol  group  with  the  exception  of 
instillation site pain (21.6%). 
The most frequently reported non-ocular AEs for netarsudil across the four Phase 3 studies, respectively, 
included headache (QD: 0%, 2.4%, 2.9% and 1.7%; BID: 4.0% and 8.3%) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (QD: 0%, 2.0%, 0% and 2.8%; BID: 3.6% and 0%), which were reported at similar incidences 
in the timolol groups (0.5 to 4.3%) (Table 34).  
Reports of treatment-related non-ocular AEs were minimal (Table 35). 
In the pooled safety analysis, the most frequently reported non-ocular AEs in the netarsudil treatment 
groups included upper respiratory infection (QD: 1.8%; BID: 3.1%), headache (QD: 1.5%; BID: 4.5%) 
and allergic dermatitis (QD: 0.5%; BID: 2.8%). Similarly, low incidences of these events were reported 
for the timolol group (Table 36).  
Treatment-related non-ocular TEAEs were reported in single subjects within a treatment group with the 
exception  of  dermatitis  allergic  (netarsudil  QD:  3  subjects,  0.4%;  BID:  7  subjects,  2.4%),  dermatitis 
contact (netarsudil QD: 5 subjects, 0.6%; BID: 3 subjects, 1.0%), headache (netarsudil QD: 6 subjects, 
0.7%; BID: 4 subjects, 1.4%; timolol: 2 subjects, 0.2%), dizziness (netarsudil BID: 2 subjects, 0.7%),

dysgeusia  (timolol:  3  subjects,  0.4%),  bradycardia  (timolol:  2  subjects,  0.2%),  nausea  (timolol:  2 
subjects, 0.2%), hypersensitivity (netarsudil QD: 2 subjects, 0.2%) and dyspnea (timolol: 3 subjects, 
0.4%).

study.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Eighty-six (86) SAEs, which included 4 deaths, were reported during the 10 completed clinical studies 
with netarsudil. SAEs were reported by a total of 66 subjects with the greatest number of reports in the 
Cardiac Disorders SOC. The majority of SAEs were either moderate or severe in intensity. All SAEs were 
non-ocular  with  the  exception  of  single  ocular  reports  of  ulcerative  keratitis  (severe,  not-related), 
cataract (mild, not-related) and iridocyclitis (severe, possibly related).  
Phase 3 Studies

Page 89/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Across the Phase 3 studies, a similar proportion of SAEs were reported in the netarsudil QD (1.5%, 3/203; 
6.8%,  17/251;  0%;  2.3%,  8/351))  and  timolol  (1.9%,  4/208;  4.8%,  12/251;  4.3%,  1/23;  2.8%, 
10/357) groups. A similar incidence of SAEs were reported for netarsudil BID (2.8%, 7/253 and 2.8% 
1/36), which was tested in two Phase 3 studies (AR-13324-CS302 and AR-13324-CS303, respectively). 
All SAEs were non-ocular with the exception of a single ocular report of cataract (mild, not related) for 
timolol and iridocyclitis (severe, possibly related) for netarsudil BID.  
No  SAEs  occurred  during  the  Phase  3  clinical  trials  which  raise  a  concern  regarding  the  safety  of 
Netarsudil. 
Two  SAEs  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  study  medication:  exacerbation  of 
coronary artery disease in a single subject in the netarsudil QD group and iridocyclitis in the netarsudil 
BID group. 
As mentioned above only 1 other serious TEAE in the netarsudil QD group was ocular, namely, worsening 
cataract requiring surgical intervention. The event was considered not related to treatment. 
All SAEs for the pooled safety population were almost all non-ocular and were reported in 3.3%, 2.8% and 
3.2% of subjects in the netarsudil QD, BID and timolol groups, respectively. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Laboratory parameters were assessed in the clinical development programme. 
In general, there were no clinically significant changes in clinical chemistry or haematology in subjects 
exposed to netarsudil for up to 12 months. There were selected, sporadic, adverse events regarding 
abnormal values in selected categories. There was a single subject treated with netarsudil who was 
discontinued from the study due to an abnormal lab value (hypoglycemia). The relationship of that 
subject’s discontinuation was judged as not related to study treatment. Thus, there was no evidence of 
clinical laboratory or haematology safety issues with netarsudil treatment.  
Vital Signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety. 
Visual Acuity 
Corrected distance visual acuity was assessed using an ETDRS or equivalent chart. Visual acuity testing 
preceded IOP measurement, the administration of topical anesthetic agents, or any examination 
requiring contact with the anterior segment. In order to standardize the assessment of visual acuity for a 
subject, all measurements were performed using the same lighting conditions and viewing distance. 
Visual acuity testing was performed in the Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies at the screening and/or qualifying, and 
post-randomization visits as outlined in Table 39 (Phase 1 and 2) and Table 40 (Phase 3). 
The presentation of visual acuity results includes evaluations of mean changes from baseline and worst 
changes from baseline including a ≥3 line change. All visual acuity changes that were reported as AEs 
were identified in addition to any subjects that discontinued test article or study participation due to these 
events. Reductions in visual acuity were reported as AEs based on the judgement of the investigator. 
Mean changes from baseline in visual acuity were small, similar among all treatment groups and not 
clinically relevant. An analysis of worst change from baseline in visual acuity demonstrated that the 
majority of subjects had less than a 1-line loss of vision. Higher incidences of subjects in the netarsudil 
groups (QD and BID) experienced a ≥3-line reduction in visual acuity compared to timolol. In addition, 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019 
Page 90/122 
Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
  
 
higher incidences of AEs were reported for visual acuity reduced and more subjects discontinued test 
article or study participation with this event in the netarsudil groups compared to timolol. 
Phase 1 and 2 Studies 
In the Phase 1 studies, mean changes from baseline were small in the netarsudil groups ranging from 
0.017 to 0.044 and a mean change of 0.02 (AR-13324 CS102). An analysis of worst change from baseline 
in visual acuity demonstrated that the majority of subjects had a worst change of less than a 1 line loss 
of vision in the netarsudil groups in Study AR-13324-CS101, (50.0%; 9/18 subjects) and Study 
AR-13324 CS102 (70.0%; 7/10 subjects). None of the subjects in either study experienced a ≥3-line loss 
of vision. No AEs were reported and no subjects discontinued test article or study participation due to a 
reduction in visual acuity. 
In the Phase 2 studies, mean changes from baseline in the study eye visual acuity scores were small in the 
netarsudil QD groups across all studies: 0.01% (0.001 to 0.037); 0.02% (-0.019 to 0.021); 0.04% 
(-0.008 to 0.047). Similar results were obtained in the control groups in these same studies: vehicle 
(-0.032 to 0.026); latanoprost (-0.016 to 0.001). In the pilot study AR-13324-CS204, mean change from 
baseline in the study eye was comparable with the other Phase 2 studies (-0.003, netarsudil and no 
change in the vehicle group).  
Similar results were obtained in the fellow eye. 
An analysis of worst change from baseline in study eye visual acuity demonstrated that the majority of 
subjects in all of the Phase 2 studies had a worst change of less than a 1-line loss of vision. These results 
were similar across all netarsudil QD groups in these studies as follows: 0.01% (50.0 to 66.7%); 0.02% 
(66.6 to 85.7%); 0.04% (73.7%). Similar results were obtained in the control groups in these same 
studies as follows: vehicle: (60.9 to 100.0%); latanoprost (75.4%). Similar results were obtained in the 
fellow eye. 
Six subjects in the netarsudil treatment groups (0.01%: 3; 0.02%: 2; 0.04%: 1) experienced a ≥3-line 
loss of vision as presented in Table 40. There was no evidence for a dose-response for this occurrence.  
Two AEs were reported for visual acuity reduced (netarsudil 0.02% QD: 1; latanoprost: 1) and no 
subjects discontinued test article or study participation due to this AE as presented in Table 38. Similar 
results were obtained in the fellow eye. 
Phase 3 Studies 
In the Phase 3 studies, mean changes from baseline in the study eye visual acuity scores were small 
across the netarsudil QD (0.010 to 0.044); netarsudil BID (0.018 to 0.048), and timolol (-0.004 to 0.027) 
groups. Similar results were obtained in the fellow eye. 
Within each treatment group, similar ranges were observed in the study eye for the following subgroups: 
age (<65 years vs ≥65 years), gender (females vs males), ethnicity (white vs other ethnicities) and iris 
color (blue/green/grey vs black/brown vs. hazel). 
Within each treatment group, similar ranges were also observed in the fellow eye for the following 
subgroups: age (<65 years vs ≥65 years), gender (females vs males), ethnicitie (white vs other 
ethnicities) and iris color (blue/green/grey vs black/brown vs hazel). 
Similar mean changes in visual acuity were also seen in the following subgroups; prior prostaglandin 
treatment, no prior prostaglandin treatment and no prior hypotensive therapy. 
An analysis of worst change from baseline in study eye visual acuity demonstrated that the majority of 
subjects in the Phase 3 studies had less than a 1 line loss of vision. These results were similar across the

netarsudil QD (54.0%), netarsudil BID (51.9%), and timolol (66.7%) groups. Similar results were 
obtained in the fellow eye. 
Sixty-eight subjects experienced a ≥3-line loss of vision across the Phase 3 studies in the netarsudil QD 
(3.8%), netarsudil BID (7.3%) and timolol (1.8%) groups. Similar results were obtained in the fellow eye. 
Within each treatment group, similar non-clinically relevant differences were seen for the subgroups of 
age (< 65 years vs ≥65 years), gender (females vs males), ethnicity (white vs other races) and iris color 
(blue/green/grey vs black/brown vs hazel). 
Eighty (80) AEs were reported for visual acuity reduced across the Phase 3 studies in the netarsudil QD 
(5.2 %), netarsudil BID (8.0%) and timolol (1.5 %) groups. More of these events were judged as related 
to test article in the netarsudil QD (65.9 %; 29 /44) and netarsudil BID (73.9 %; 17 /23) groups 
compared to timolol (38.5 %; 5 /13).  
Eighteen (18) subjects discontinued test article due to the AE with visual acuity reduced as an AE at the 
exit visit across the Phase 3 studies. The incidence was higher with netarsudil QD (1.2 %, 10/839) and 
netarsudil BID (2.8%, 8 /289) compared to timolol 0%.

Biomicroscopy 
External examination of the eye and anterior segment were performed with slit lamp biomicroscopy using 
magnification consistent with clinical practice. The examination included an assessment of the eyelids, 
conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil and lens. Biomicroscopy grading was done with the use 
of standardized scales provided in each of the study protocols. Biomicroscopy evaluations were performed 
in all Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies at the screening and/or qualifying, and post-randomization visits. Changes 
in biomicroscopy parameters were reported as AEs based on the judgment of the investigator. In 
addition, changes in biomicroscopy parameters were identified as clinically significant by the investigator. 
In the Phase 2 studies, the major biomicroscopic finding observed with netarsudil treatment by the 
investigators was conjunctival hyperaemia. While this was in agreement with the AE reports of 
conjunctival hyperaemia (and related terms), the incidence of objective findings in biomicroscopy was 
less than with AEs. This difference was interpreted as the AEs including observations made by subjects at 
any time during the study versus observations made solely by the investigator during a biomicroscopic 
examination. Of note was the absence of other potential major findings (e.g., corneal edema, anterior 
chamber cells or flare). 
The Phase 2 findings were predictive of the observations in the larger, longer-term Phase 3 studies with 
regards to conjunctival hyperaemia.  
Other biomicroscopic findings with low incidence seen in the netarsudil treatment groups in the Phase 3 
studies were lid erythema and lid edema. Corneal staining was observed with similar incidence in the 
netarsudil and timolol treatment groups. Cornea verticillata, as noted in Section on ADRs, was primarily 
recorded as “other” and captured as a TEAE, and thus not in these tables. 
Thus, other than conjunctival hyperaemia, cornea verticillata, and to a lesser extent, lid edema and lid 
erythema, chronic treatment with netarsudil QD was similar to timolol in its ocular safety as judged by 
investigators with biomicroscopic evaluation. 
Within each treatment group, similar non-clinically relevant results were observed for the subgroups of 
age (< 65 years vs ≥65 years), gender (females vs males), ethnicity (white vs other races) and iris color 
(blue/green/grey vs black/brown vs hazel). Similar results were also observed in the fellow eye. 
The pooled Phase 3 analysis showed that higher incidences of conjunctival hyperaemia occurred in the 
netarsudil QD and BID groups in males versus females (QD: 60.5 vs. 50.0%; BID: 74.8 vs. 67.0%) and 
in white versus other ethnicities (QD: 61.3 vs. 34.1%; BID: 75.4 vs. 55.1%).  
Higher incidences of cornea verticillata occurred in the netarsudil QD and BID groups in elderly (≥65 
years) versus non-elderly (<65 years) (QD: 24.8 vs. 15.9%; BID: 30.7 vs. 23.0%), in males versus

females (QD: 24.4 vs. 18.4%; BID: 31.8 vs. 24.2%) and in white versus other ethnicities (QD: 25.6 vs. 
7.0%; BID: 32.7 vs. 8.2%). 
Results were also similar in terms of biomicroscopic examination in subjects with prior prostaglandin 
treatment, no prior prostaglandin treatment, and no prior hypotensive treatment.

Ophthalmoscopy 
Dilated ophthalmoscopy was performed in the Phases 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies at the screening and 
post-randomization visits. The examination included an assessment of the retina, macula, choroid, optic 
nerve, and vitreous humor using a grading scale of normal or abnormal. Changes in ophthalmoscopy 
parameters were reported as AEs based on the judgment of the investigator. In addition, changes in 
ophthalmoscopy parameters were identified as clinically significant by the investigator. 
For the most part, across all studies, there were relatively few changes in ophthalmoscopy, and the 
changes were similar across the treatment groups. This is reflected in the low rate of AEs associated with 
ophthalmoscopy. 
Cup-Disc Ratio 
Measurement of the vertical cup-disc ratio was performed as part of the dilated ophthalmoscopy 
examination in all clinical studies at the screening and post-randomization visits. The cup-disc ratio was 
scored on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0 units in 0.1-unit increments. AEs for any change in this parameter were

reported at the discretion of the investigator. A change from baseline of 0.2 units or more in either eye 
was defined as a clinically significant change. 
Clinically significant changes from baseline in cup-disc ratio were only reported in the Phase 3 studies, 
with similar numbers reported across all treatment groups in both studies.  
In the 12- month Phase 3 study (AR-13324-CS302), the mean cup-disc ratio baseline values were similar 
in the netarsudil and timolol groups and remained relatively constant over the treatment period. Isolated 
AEs reflective of changes in the optic nerve were reported but no patterns emerged. 
Adverse events reflective of changes in the optic nerve were only reported in the 12-month studies. Study 
AR-13324-CS302 included 3 reports of optic nerve cup-disc ratio increased in the netarsudil QD (1 report) 
and BID (2 reports) groups and isolated reports of glaucomatous optic disc atrophy (netarsudil QD group) 
and optic nerve cupping (timolol group).  
In study AR-13324-CS303 there were 3 reports of optic disc hemorrhage in the netarsudil BID (2 reports) 
and timolol (1 report) groups. Only one subject discontinued test article or study participation due to 
these events (AR-13324-CS302, netarsudil BID).  
Isolated AEs reflective of changes in the optic nerve were reported but no patterns emerged. 
Specular Microscopy 
Specular microscopy was not performed in the Phase 1 or 2 studies. Specular microscopy was performed 
in one of the Phase 3 studies (AR-13324-CS302) at the qualifying (baseline) and month 3 visits. This 
testing was done at selected sites based upon the availability of a specular microscope. Prior to providing 
any corneal endothelial cell photographs, the study sites were certified by the centralized reading center. 
During the study, the sites provided 3 images of each eye and the data were submitted electronically via 
a web portal to the centralized reading center. 
The specular microscopy parameters analyzed included endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation 
(variation in individual cell area; also known as polymegathism), and hexagonality (percentage of 6 sided 
cells; also known as pleomorphism). The presentation of the specular microscopy results to follow 
includes an evaluation of these parameters comparing baseline to month 3 values. 
The endothelial cell density baseline values were similar in the netarsudil QD (2480 cells/mm2), 
netarsudil BID (2447 cells/mm2), and timolol (2455 cells/mm2) groups.  
The mean changes from baseline to month 3 in cell density were small and not clinically relevant 
comparing the netarsudil QD (+1.7 cells/mm2), netarsudil BID (+16.8 cells/mm2), and timolol (-1.1 
cells/mm2) groups as presented in AR-13324-CS302. Similar results were obtained in the study and 
fellow eyes. 
The variation in individual cell areas was assessed by determining the coefficient of variation 
(polymegathism). The coefficient of variation values were almost identical at baseline across the 
netarsudil QD (32.4%), netarsudil BID (32.8%), and timolol (32.6%) groups. The mean changes from 
baseline to month 3 were very small and not clinically relevant comparing the netarsudil QD (-1.6%), 
netarsudil BID (-2.0%), and timolol (-1.4%) groups as presented in AR-13324-CS302. Similar results 
were obtained in the study and fellow eyes. 
Finally, the hexagonality was assessed to determine the percentage of endothelial cells that were 6 sided 
(pleomorphism). The hexagonality values were almost identical at baseline across the netarsudil QD 
(59.5%), netarsudil BID (59.1%), and timolol (59.2%) groups. The mean changes from baseline to 
month 3 were very small and not clinically relevant comparing the netarsudil QD (-0.5%), netarsudil BID 
(-0.8%), and timolol (+0.7%) groups. Similar results were obtained in the study and fellow eyes.

In summary, the changes in endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation, and hexagonality were small 
and not clinically relevant based upon the 3 month on-therapy time point at which these parameters were 
assessed.  
Pachymetry 
Central corneal thickness was measured in both eyes using ultrasound pachymetry at screening in all 
Phase 2 and 3 studies, and also at follow-up in StudyAR-13324 CS202 (day 28). In this study, no subject 
experienced a criterion increase (100 μm) in central corneal thickness during the study 
(AR-13324-CS302). 
Intraocular Pressure 
Intraocular pressure was measured in the Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies at the screening and/or qualifying, and 
post-randomization visits. Two consecutive IOP measurements of each eye were obtained at various time 
points during each visit using a calibrated Goldmann applanation tonometer. Intraocular pressure was 
evaluated as a safety measure by identifying all on-therapy IOP increases ≥ 10 mmHg in all Phase 1 and 
3 studies, and as an efficacy parameter in all of the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  
In the 12-month Phase 3 studies, AR-13324-CS302 and AR-13324-CS303, IOP was measured at a single 
08:00 hour time point at Months 6, 9 and 12. In study AR-13324-CS304 IOP was measured at 08:00, 
10:00 and 16:00 hours throughout the duration of the study. Adverse events for any change in IOP were 
reported based on the judgment of the investigator. 
Phase 1 Studies: No AEs for IOP were reported and there were no IOP increases ≥ 10 mmHg. 
Phase 2 Studies:  
Study AR-13324-CS201: No AEs for IOP reported. 
Study AR-13324-CS202: There were 2 reports of “intraocular pressure fluctuation” and 1 report of 
“intraocular pressure increased”, all in the netarsudil 0.01% treatment group. 
Study AR-13324-CS204: No AEs for IOP reported. 
Phase 3 Studies 
The pooled population included 19 reports of intraocular pressure increased in the netarsudil QD (14 
reports), netarsudil BID (2 reports), and timolol (3 reports) groups. With the exception of 1 subject in the 
netarsudil QD group, these events were mild to moderate in intensity and 17 reports were considered 
related to test article (netarsudil QD: 12; netarsudil BID: 2; timolol: 3). Fourteen (14) of the subjects 
(netarsudil QD: 11; netarsudil BID: 1; timolol: 2) discontinued test article or study participation due to 
this event. 
A total of 4 reports (0.5%) of IOP increase ≥10 mmHg at any post-baseline visit were recorded in the 
study eye for the netarsudil QD treatment group, with no reports in the netarsudil BID or timolol groups. 
Four fellow eyes of subjects in the netarsudil QD group experienced an IOP increase of ≥ 10 mmHg. 
Vital Signs 
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in all Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies at the screening and/or 
qualifying, and post-randomization visits. Adverse events for any change in vital signs were reported 
based on the judgment of the investigator. 
The presentation of the blood pressure and heart rate results includes an evaluation of the mean changes 
from baseline values at all on-therapy visits with an emphasis on the maximal changes observed.  
Phase 1 and 2 Studies

Page 96/122 
 
 
  
In these studies, the changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP), and heart rate (HR) were generally small and not clinically relevant. 
In Study AR-13324-CS101, the mean changes from baseline are SBP (+3.2 mmHg), DBP (+3.9 mmHg), 
and HR (-13.1 bpm). Even though some of the mean HR values were reduced by 10 bpm or more, none 
of the mean values at any visit fell below 60 bpm which is within the normal range for the healthy subjects 
that participated in this study.  
No AEs consistent with any vital sign changes were reported.  
In Study AR-13324-CS102, the mean changes from baseline in SBP (-8.4 mmHg), DBP (-2.0 mmHg), and 
HR (+2.2 bpm) were small and not clinically relevant. No AEs consistent with any vital sign changes were 
reported.  
-In the Phase 2 studies, the mean changes from baseline in SBP, DBP, and HR were small and similar 
comparing the treatment groups across all Phase 2 studies. There were no dose-related changes in any of 
these parameters comparing the netarsudil groups and none of these mean changes were clinically 
relevant.  
-Mean changes in SBP in the netarsudil 0.01% (-3.0 to -2.3 mmHg), 0.02% (-2.2 to 1.9 mmHg), and 
0.04% (2.8 mmHg) groups were comparable to changes in the vehicle (-5.1 to -0.3 mmHg) and 
latanoprost (-2.1 to -0.5 mmHg) control groups.  
-Mean changes in DBP in the netarsudil 0.01% (-2.0 to 3.1 mmHg), 0.02% (-2.0 to 1.4 mmHg), and 
0.04% (-3.1 mmHg) groups were also comparable to changes in the vehicle (-3.0 to 0.8 mmHg) and 
latanoprost (-1.1 to -0.2 mmHg) control groups.  
-Similarly, mean changes in HR in the netarsudil 0.01% (-1.0 to 3.5 bpm), 0.02% (-2.7 to +1.0 bpm), 
and 0.04% (-2.5 bpm) groups were comparable to changes in the vehicle (2.9 to 16.0 bpm) and 
latanoprost (-1.6 to -0.3 bpm) groups.  
No AEs consistent with any vital sign changes were reported in the Phase 2 studies.  
Phase 3 Studies 
The vital sign parameters were assessed across all Phase 3 studies. With respect to the pooled analysis, 
mean changes over the study in SBP in the netarsudil QD (-3.7 to -0.4 mmHg) and netarsudil BID (-2.4 
to +0.6 mmHg) groups were comparable to the timolol group (-2.2 to -0.1 mmHg).  
Mean changes in DBP in the netarsudil QD (-1.2 to +0.4 mmHg) and BID (-2.7 to +0.5 mmHg) groups 
were also comparable to the timolol group (-1.5 to +0.3 mmHg). 
Changes in mean HR in the timolol group demonstrated statistically significant reductions from baseline 
and ranged from -1.5 to -3.0 bpm. In comparison there were no statistically significant reductions in 
mean HR in the netarsudil groups (QD [-1.3 to +0.9 bpm] and BID [-1.1 to +0.4]) except for a single visit 
in the netarsudil QD group in AR-13324-CS302 (1.3 bpm) (ISS Table 14.3.6.1). 
Several AEs reflective of changes in vital signs were reported across the four Phase 3 studies. These 
included 12 reports of blood pressure increased across the netarsudil QD (4 reports), netarsudil BID (3 
reports), and timolol (5 reports) groups. These events were mild to moderate in intensity and considered 
not related to test article. Two additional AEs of heart rate irregular were reported in the netarsudil QD 
group (AR-13324-CS302). These events were mild in intensity and 1 was considered related to test 
article; neither of these events led to discontinuation of test article or study participation. In addition, 
there was 1 report of heart rate reduced in the timolol group; this event was moderate in intensity and 
considered possibly related to test article and the subject was discontinued from the study

Summary 
In summary, the mean changes from baseline in SBP, DBP, and HR were generally small and not clinically 
relevant in subjects treated with netarsudil. In subjects treated with timolol, there was a statistically 
significant reduction in mean heart rate. One report of heart rate reduced in the timolol group was 
considered possibly related to test article and the subject was discontinued from the study. Several AEs 
were reported for blood pressure increased and heart rate irregular; none of the affected subjects 
discontinued test article or study participation due to either of these events. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
All of the safety parameters evaluated in the Phase 3 studies were analyzed based on various intrinsic 
factors that included age category, race, sex, and iris color. These analyses were conducted after pooling 
these data from the four netarsudil Phase 3 studies. For the most part, there was no difference between 
netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% QD and timolol ophthalmic solution 0.5% BID with respect to 
differences in their safety profiles across demographic groups. 
The key findings from these pooled analyses showed some statistically significant but not clinically 
relevant differences between subgroups as follows: 
1.  Whites had a higher incidence of both overall adverse events and ocular adverse events when 
compared to subjects of other ethnicities for both netarsudil and timolol. The comparative incidences 
(white vs. other races) of ocular events were as follows: netarsudil QD (89.0 vs. 66.8%); netarsudil 
BID (93.8 vs. 80.8%); timolol (64.2 vs. 50.0%). 
2.  An analysis of adverse event severity indicated that in the netarsudil treatment groups, white 
subjects had greater incidences of moderate and severe adverse events compared to subjects of 
other races. 
3.  Higher incidences of conjunctival hyperaemia occurred in the netarsudil QD and BID groups in males 
versus females (QD: 60.5 vs. 50.0%; BID: 74.8 vs. 67.0%) and in white versus other ethnicities 
(QD: 61.3 vs. 34.1%; BID: 75.4 vs. 55.1%). 
4.  Higher incidences of cornea verticillata occurred in the netarsudil QD and BID groups in elderly (≥65 
years) versus non-elderly (<65 years) (QD: 24.8 vs. 15.9%; BID: 30.7 vs. 23.0%), in males versus 
females (QD: 24.4 vs. 18.4%; BID: 31.8 vs. 24.2%) and in white versus other ethnicities (QD: 25.6 
vs. 7.0%; BID: 32.7 vs. 8.2%). 
In addition, there were also no notable differences observed between subjects with no prior ocular 
hypotensive treatment versus previously treated subjects, and no differences between prior 
prostaglandin use and no prior prostaglandin use). 
An analysis of safety in subjects with concomitant systemic medications was not performed since the 
systemic exposure to netarsudil has been shown to be negligible. 
Extrinsic Factors 
The recommended dosage of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% is 1 drop instilled into the eye QD for 
all patients. Therapy is not individualized based upon extrinsic factors and thus an analysis of safety by 
extrinsic factors is not applicable. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no adequate or well-controlled studies using netarsudil in pregnant women.

The clinical studies conducted during the development of netarsudil excluded women of childbearing 
potential who were pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically acceptable form of 
birth control. 
During the clinical development of netarsudil, one pregnancy was reported in a female subject who was 
enrolled in the Phase 3 Study AR-13324-CS302 and received test article for 87 days with the last dose on 
25 February 2015 at which time the subject discontinued from the study due to a protocol violation 
(failure to use acceptable form of contraception and a positive pregnancy test). The subject had a 
negative pregnancy test at the screening visit and was using a condom/spermicide as a form of 
contraception. The outcome of the pregnancy was the delivery of a healthy baby at 37 weeks gestation. 
Immunological events 
No immunological events were reported. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction studies were performed during the clinical development of netarsudil 
(also due to the lack of systemic absorption of netarsudil after ocular dosing) and none were reported. 
Netarsudil ophthalmic solution has been administered safely in conjunction with other ophthalmic 
medications and diagnostic agents to include antibiotics, anesthetics, cycloplegics, mydriatics, ocular 
lubricants, and vital dyes. Netarsudil ophthalmic solution was also used in a fixed dosed combination with 
latanoprost. 
The applicant has provided general recommendations in the SmPC relating to the concomitant use of 
other topically administered ocular preparations, it is noted that these recommendations are largely 
based on extrapolation from general administration recommendations from other ocular medicines rather 
than on specific data from netarsudil use. As netarsudil is a new active substance, it would be preferable 
to further explore this topic and the applicant has agreed to further evaluate this issue through the PASS. 
In section 4.2 of the proposed SmPC, the applicant includes specific guidance for HCPs and patients 
outlining that a period of 5 minutes should be observed before other topical ocular preparations are 
administered following netarsudil administration.  Recommendation with regards to the order of 
administration of different ocular preparations is also included. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 1 Studies 
All but one subject completed the Phase 1 studies. One subject in the AR-13324-CS102 study 
discontinued early due to an AE. 
Phase 2 Studies 
Nearly all subjects in the Phase 2 studies completed their respective study. Only 9 subjects of 209 (4.3%) 
exposed to netarsudil were discontinued from a Phase 2 study (Table 16), 2 of which (1.0%) discontinued 
for AEs.  
No subjects discontinued early from study AR-1332-CS204, for any reason, including AEs. 
Phase 3 Studies 
The discontinuation rates in the longer duration Phase 3 studies were higher than in Phase 2. In the Phase 
3 studies a greater proportion of subjects in the netarsudil groups compared with the timolol group 
Assessment report

discontinued study participation prior to completing the study (15.3% QD vs. 6.2% timolol in 
AR-13324-CS301; 41.8% QD; 66.1% BID vs. 18.7% timolol in AR-13324-CS302; 52.9% QD; 88.9% BID 
vs. 17.4% timolol in AR-13324-CS303; and 30.8% QD vs. 12.0% timolol in AR-13324-CS304). 
In the pooled population, the majority of discontinued netarsudil QD and BID subjects were discontinued 
due to AEs (174/264 [65.9%] and 161/198 [81.3%], respectively).  
The most frequent reason for discontinuation of timolol subjects was AE and withdrawal of consent, each 
26.4% (28/106 subjects) (Table 17). Non-compliance with study medication and lack of efficacy were 
observed in only small numbers of subjects across treatment groups and studies. 
In the pooled analysis of the 4 AR-13324 Phase 3 studies, a total of 575 (68.5%) netarsudil QD, 91 
(31.5%) netarsudil BID and 733 (87.4%) timolol BID subjects completed the full study duration. 
Conversely, a greater proportion of subjects discontinued study participation in the netarsudil groups 
(31.5% QD, 68.5% BID) compared to timolol (12.6%). The most frequent reason for discontinuation was 
AE: 65.9% netarsudil QD, 81.4% netarsudil BID, and 26.4% timolol. 
Discontinuation for Adverse Events in the Pooled Phase 3 Population 
In the pooled analysis, discontinuations of test article due to TEAEs were highest in the netarsudil BID 
group (54.3%) followed by netarsudil QD group (19.3%,) and timolol group (1.7%).  
The majority of discontinuations in the netarsudil QD and BID groups were associated with ocular events, 
whereas the majority of discontinuations in the timolol groups were associated with non-ocular events. 
The most frequently reported (≥5% of subjects) TEAEs associated with test article discontinuation in the 
netarsudil groups were conjunctival hyperaemia (QD: 5.8%; BID: 26.3%), cornea verticillata (QD: 3.7%; 
BID: 10.0%), and vision blurred (QD: 1.4%; BID: 6.9%).  
In the pooled analysis of the 4 AR-13324 Phase 3 studies, a total of 575 (68.5%) netarsudil QD, 91 
(31.5%) netarsudil BID and 733 (87.4%) timolol BID subjects completed the full study duration. 
Conversely, a greater proportion of subjects discontinued study participation in the netarsudil groups 
(31.5% QD, 68.5% BID) compared to timolol (12.6%). The most frequent reason for discontinuation was 
AE: 65.9% netarsudil QD, 81.4% netarsudil BID, and 26.4% timolol. 
Post marketing experience 
Netarudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% was approved for use in patients with OAG / OHT by the US FDA on 
17th December 2017. At the cut-off point 30 April 2018, 5 medical reports of AEs had been received 
following use of netarsudil. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The assessment of the clinical safety data for netarsudil 0.02% was largely based around the phase 2 and 
phase 3 clinical studies with netarsudil 0.02% once daily versus active comparator timolol. Data on the 
use of netarsudil 0.02% administered twice daily was also presented although this specific posology is not 
being pursued. 
In general, the sample size and the safety population included in the main studies are considered 
appropriate for the overall safety analysis.  
In several of the clinical studies, the dosage of netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution was administered 
topically as either a once daily or twice daily administration. There was an increased frequency of AEs with 
Netarsudil 0.02% when administered twice daily versus once daily.

In this context, 969 patients were exposed to once daily dosing with Netarsudil 0.02% solution in the 
clinical development for the mono constituent product. 
Additional exposure data for netarsudil 0.02% is provided via the parallel clinical development for the FDC 
product. This is considered supportive data. 
Broadly speaking, the studied population is considered representative of the target population that is 
expected to receive Netarsudil 0.02% solution and this is acceptable. 
The demographic characteristics of patients included in the phase III clinical studies for netarsudil 0.02% 
once daily included patients ranging in age from 14-96 years with a mean age of 64.9 years. In patients 
treated with netarsudil 0.02% once daily, 55.8% of patients were ≥65 years, reflective of the target 
population. Paediatric patients under 18 years were not specifically studied. This is acceptable given the 
proposed target population. 
A higher number of patients treated with netarsudil 0.02% in the phase III safety population had a 
diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma (64.4%). 35.6 % of patients had a diagnosis of ocular hypertension.  
Almost 75% of patients treated with netarsudil 0.02% once daily in the phase III safety population were 
Caucasian. The applicant clarified that a higher number of Caucasian subjects were enrolled in all 
netarsudil studies, which is comparable with the distribution of ethnicities enrolled in studies conducted 
for other approved ocular hypotensive medications. Of note, the incidence of AEs in Caucasians was 
approximately 1.3-times higher compared to other ethnicities in both the timolol and netarsudil treatment 
groups so the applicant does not believe that these data represent a safety signal for Caucasians treated 
with netarsudil. 
An update on any evolving data from ongoing studies and post-marketing experience was presented by 
the applicant and no new safety concerns arise. 
Duration of exposure is in general between 6- 12 months.  Within the netarsudil treatment group, 361 
subjects were exposed to netarsudil 0.02% once daily for a duration of 6 months to 12 months. In 
addition, a total of 252 subjects completed over 12 months of therapy with netarsudil 0.02% once daily. 
The applicant was asked to provide an overview of longer term safety specific to the use of netarsudil 
0.02% once daily beyond 12 months. It was highlighted to the applicant that this is a new active 
substance for the topical treatment of glaucoma, a condition which generally requires chronic long term 
treatment. In this context, there was a concern that some adverse events either already established or 
evolving could occur or worsen after several months to years of netarsudil treatment (eg. possible 
adverse impact of long-term corneal deposition on visual acuity, punctate keratitis, potential for 
periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discolouration/ iris hyperpigmentation due to possible melanin 
binding, and adverse changes in cornea due to chronic administration of BAK), the overall duration of 
exposure of the proposed product is therefore considered somewhat limited in this context. In the 
responses to the day 120 LoQ, the applicant acknowledged the absence of longer term safety data with 
netarsudil 0.02% and proposed to address this issue through a PASS to evaluate longer term safety of 
netarsudil in the proposed indication. This proposal is endorsed.  
The majority of AEs reported for either treatment group during the safety clinical trials were local ocular 
events. 
Based on the existing PK data, the potential for systemic absorption following topical ophthalmic 
administration of Netarsudil in human subjects is low. Therefore, pharmacologically related ADRs with the 
use of Netarsudil 0.02% Solution are expected to be local ocular effects with a very low chance of 
systemic ADRs. This is in line with the data from the netarsudil clinical studies.

The most frequent adverse event associated with the use of Netarsudil 0.02% solution is hyperaemia of 
the eye. Hyperaemia of the eye generally occurs with the onset of use and generally subsides or resolves 
over time though it can occur sporadically. The majority of cases were mild. The incidence of hyperaemia 
was dose related. The incidence was reduced when netarsudil was administered as an evening dose 
versus morning administration. The incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia in phase II studies associated 
with once daily netarsudil administered in the evening was 38.9% (versus vehicle 4.3% and latanoprost 
15.6%). 
Non-ocular AEs were rarely reported for netarsudil in the phase II studies. 
AEs observed in the pooled Netarsudil safety data from phase 3 studies: 
Long-term safety data from clinical trials was provided in the 3, 6 and 12 month Phase 3 studies 
(AR-13324 CS302, AR-13324-CS303, and AR-13324-CS304) which included a total of 1,556 subjects 
across the netarsudil QD (636 subjects), BID (289 subjects), and timolol (631 subjects) groups. Within 
the netarsudil treatment group, 361 subjects were exposed to netarsudil 0.02% once daily for a duration 
of 6 months to 12 months.    
Overall, the majority of adverse drug reactions associated with the use of Netarsudil 0.02% solution have 
been mild local ocular side-effects that tend to increase in incidence (and sometimes severity) in a 
dose-dependent manner.  
In the pooled Phase 3 safety population, the majority of TEAEs were mild in intensity. It is noted that more 
patients in the timolol group experienced mild TEAEs (73.3%) versus netarsudil 0.02 % QD group 
(58.5%). However, a higher percentage of subjects in the netarsudil group (QD: 73.1%) compared to 
those in the timolol group (42.3%) experienced AEs that were considered treatment related. 
Although many of these local ocular side-effects generally improve and resolve over time, a high 
percentage of cases can also occur sporadically eg. Ocular hyperaemia. This could potentially impact on 
patient compliance with long term treatment but this has to be balanced against the potential for greater 
systemic ADRs which are known to occur with other currently approved glaucoma treatments. 
As outlined in the above tables, the majority of ADRs reported during the study were for local ocular 
effects. Exposure to Netarsudil 0.02% once daily versus twice daily resulted in a lower incidence of ADRs. 
In the subgroup analyses in the pooled Phase 3 population, white patients had a higher incidence of both 
overall adverse events and ocular adverse events when compared to subjects of other races. The 
comparative incidences (white vs. other races) of ocular events were as follows: netarsudil QD (89.0 vs. 
66.8%); timolol (64.2 vs. 50.0%). These patients also had a greater incidence of moderate and severe 
adverse events compared to subjects of other races. 
The applicant clarified that a relative difference in the safety profile between sub populations could only be 
demonstrated if randomization was stratified by sub group, it therefore cannot be concluded that there is 
true difference between the Caucasian and “Other” ethnicities in the safety profiles for netarsudil as the 
study design did not apply a stratified randomization schedule based on subgroups Caucasian vs. “Other” 
ethnicities. A higher number of Caucasian subjects were enrolled in all netarsudil studies, which is 
comparable with the distribution of ethnicities enrolled in studies conducted for other approved ocular 
hypotensive medications. Of note, the incidence of AEs in Caucasians was approximately 1.3-times higher 
in both the timolol and netarsudil treatment groups. 
Hyperaemia 
The most common ADR reported across all studies in the safety population was hyperaemia of the eye. 
A numerically lower incidence of hyperaemia of the eye was reported in the comparator Timolol solution 
group relative to the Netarsudil 0.02% solution (at both once daily and twice daily dosing) (11.8% and 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

14.5%, respectively). The severity of conjunctival hyperaemia was similar between the 2 treatment 
groups as approximately 90% of the reports in each group were assessed as mild. In both the phase II 
and phase III studies, the incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia was notably higher for once daily 
netarsudil 0.02% when compared to either latanoprost (netarsudil 38.9% versus latanoprost 15.6%) or 
timolol (54.4% versus 10.4%). 
The ocular tolerability findings associated with netarsudil are reflected in the proposed SmPC and these 
local ADRs have to be balanced against the point that other approved glaucoma treatments may have 
greater potential for systemic ADRs or may be contraindicated in the glaucoma population due to 
co-morbid medical conditions. 
Long term safety of netarsudil, including discontinuation rates due to ocular ADRs will be followed up 
through routine pharmacovigilance and through the proposed PASS. 
Conjunctival haemorrhage 
The incidence of conjunctival hemorrhage across the four Phase 3 studies appeared to be notably higher 
in the netarsudil groups (QD: 15.8 to 20.6%) compared to timolol (0.8 to 3.1%). When present, 
conjunctival hemorrhage was typically reported as mild and was considered treatment-related. 
This ADR is reflected in the SmPC and ocular safety will be followed in the planned PASS study for long 
term treatment with netarsudil. 
Corneal verticillata 
In the long term studies, corneal verticillata were commonly reported in approximately 20% of patients 
treated with netarsudil 0.02% QD. By comparison, corneal verticillata were only reported in 0.2% of 
patients treated with timolol.  
The proposed pathophysiology appears to be similar to the established process of drug-induced 
phospholipoidosis observed with other medicines, most commonly amiodarone. The applicant conducted 
a Corneal Deposit Observation Study (AR-13324-OBS01) to further evaluate visual function in subjects 
who developed corneal deposits in the AR-13324-CS301 and -CS302 clinical studies. At the completion of 
the observational study, there was no clinically meaningful impact of corneal verticillata on visual function 
as measured by visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and a visual function questionnaire. Corneal verticillata 
were noted to have resolved in all but 3 subjects (4 eyes); in these 3 subjects the corneal deposit grade 
had decreased and the event stabilized by the completion of the study. After study completion, cornea 
verticillata resolved in 1 of these subjects and had improved in the other 2 subjects (3 out of 4 eyes). It 
is noted that corneal deposits or verticillata generally resolved on discontinuation of netarsudil.  
In view of the chronic nature of glaucoma treatment and since netarsudil is a new active substance, it 
would be helpful if further clinical experience beyond one year duration of treatment was available in 
order to further confirm the clinical behaviour of netarsudil-induced corneal deposits with real-world 
chronic use of netarsudil 0.02% QD.  
The applicant was asked to discuss the issue of corneal veticillata further in the context of any additional 
post-marketing data available since submission of this application and any additional PV measures 
required for longer term follow-up. In acknowledging the absence of longer term safety data with 
netarsudil use in the proposed indication, the applicant proposed to conduct a PASS to further evaluate 
longer term safety of netarsudil in the proposed indication. This is supported. 
The applicant also acknowledges that the incidence of corneal verticillata was higher in certain 
subpopulations (elderly patients (≥65 years), in male patients and in white patients versus other races). 
This has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

Data from slit lamp examination from the pooled safety population indicated that higher incidences of 
corneal verticillata occurred in the netarsudil QD and BID groups in elderly (≥65 years) versus non-elderly 
(<65 years) (QD: 24.8 vs. 15.9%; BID: 30.7 vs. 23.0%), in males versus females (QD: 24.4 vs. 18.4%; 
BID: 31.8 vs. 24.2%) and in white versus other ethnicities (QD: 25.6 vs. 7.0%; BID: 32.7 vs. 8.2%). 
The difference in the incidence of cornea verticillata between subgroups is statistically significant for 
Females vs. Males (p=0.0354, netarsudil QD and p=0.0150 for netarsudil QD and BID combined), and 
highly statistically significant between Caucasian and “Other” ethnicities (p<0.0001 both for netarsudil 
QD alone and combined with netarsudil BID) and between subgroups of age <65 yr vs. ≥65 yrs (p=0.0017 
for netarsudil QD and p=0.0008 for QD and BID combined) 
No specific hypothesis is available in relation to these findings. The applicant postulates that the 
differences observed between the subgroups might be related to differences in the rate of corneal 
metabolism of netarsudil but there is no robust justification to support this at this time.  
The applicant states that in all cases, patients were asymptomatic and visual function was not impacted 
by the presence of cornea verticillata and argues that the differences between subgroups does not appear 
to be of clinical significance. 
Nevertheless, in view of the remaining uncertainty around unexplained higher rates of verticillata in 
certain subpopulations and given that this is a new active substance, it is recommended that this issue 
should be further followed in the PASS in an effort to provide additional insights into these findings. 
The applicant acknowledges that the incidence of corneal verticillata was higher in certain subpopulations 
(elderly patients (≥65 years), in male patients and in white patients versus other races). This has been 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Other ocular AEs 
Other ocular AEs of note which were reported at a higher frequency in the netarsudil 0.02% QD group 
when compared to timolol 0.5% BD were: 
Blurred vision: 7.4% (netarsudil) versus 1.4%(timolol) 
Increased lacrimation: 7.2% (netarsudil) versus 0.6% (timolol) 
Reduced visual acuity: 5.2% (netarsudil) versus 1.5% (timolol) 
Although these AEs occur at a lower frequency when compared to the commonly reported AEs of 
conjunctival hyperaemia, conjunctival haemorrhage and corneal verticillata, these are still considered 
important in the context of the characterisation of the overall safety profile of netarsudil and in terms of 
patient compliance with long term treatment which will be followed up in the PASS.  
It is noted that a higher percentage of the following AEs of relevance occurred in the netarsudil 0.02% QD 
population when compared to timolol. 
Eyelid erythema: 6.8% (netarsudil) versus 0.7% (timolol) 
Eye pruritus: 4.1% (netarsudil) versus 0.8% (timolol) 
Eyelid oedema: 3.5% (netarsudil) versus 0.7% (timolol) 
Eyelid pruritus: 2.1% (netarsudil) versus 0.2% (timolol) 
Allergic conjunctivitis: 2.5% (netarsudil) versus 0.1% (timolol) 
It is noted that instillation site pain occurred at a similar frequency across netarsudil 0.02% and timolol 
treatments (19.9% versus 21.6%).

Benzalkonium Chloride (BAK) 
The applicant has highlighted the potential concerns with long term continuous use of BAK in chronic long 
term use. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that similar concentrations of BAK are found in other currently 
approved ocular treatments for glaucoma. 
The possible influence of BAK on the higher frequency of ocular ADRs generally observed with netarsudil 
0.02% in terms of its contribution to these findings is difficult to quantify. Cases of punctate keratitis 
n=27, known to be associated with BAK were observed with netarsudil 0.02% QD in the pooled safety 
population (3.2%). Cases of punctate keratitis were also reported with timolol but at a lesser frequency 
(1.8%). 
The potential effect of BAK on contact lenses is reflected in the proposed SmPC in line with the most 
recently updated EU Excipient Guidelines.  
During the CHMP SA procedure, there were discussions regarding the concentration of BAK in the 
proposed product and the applicant considered that removal or reduction of the BAK concentration could 
be feasible going forward. Furthermore, in the responses to the clinical safety query on BAK, the applicant 
acknowledges the potential for future improvements on the benefit risk profile of the product as regards 
the concentration of this preservative. While the applicant maintains that the safety of the existing 
concentration is widely established and in line with other approved products, which is acknowledged, 
given the ocular tolerability profile of the current formulation and in order to optimise the benefit-risk 
profile in the proposed indication, the applicant was asked to provide an update on whether work was 
ongoing to enhance the benefit-risk of netarsudil 0.02% with specific reference to the issue of BAK in the 
context of the EMA SA advice. 
The applicant confirmed that it is actively pursuing the re-formulation aspects of the product and 
proposals for a revised bridging study based on previous CHMP SA have been submitted. The applicant’s 
general proposals for the re-formulation and for the bridging study are considered broadly acceptable.   
Conclusion on ocular AEs 
In summary, based on the above findings from the pooled safety data, it is noteworthy that ocular 
intolerance to Netarsudil 0.02% was notably higher when compared to the timolol treatment group. A 
higher frequency of local AEs were reported consistently across the pooled clinical safety studies for 
netarsudil, including at the 0.02% QD posology for the proposed formulation. As outlined above, 
numerically higher percentages of ocular AEs were reported in the netarsudil 0.02% QD treatment group 
for the ADRs conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular hyperaemia, conjunctival haemorrhage, corneal deposits, 
eye irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, eyelid pruritus, reduced visual acuity, increased lacrimation and 
blurred vision when compared to timolol. 
It is noted that in patients with either ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma, pharmacological 
treatment focuses on reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in order to delay or prevent the progression of 
ocular hypertension to glaucoma, and to slow disease progression in glaucoma patients. In both cases, 
patients require lifelong treatment and follow-up care to preserve vision, so long-term patient compliance 
and persistence with glaucoma medication is essential since patients who do not continue therapy risk 
developing elevated IOP levels and, over time, progressing to blindness. 
Compliance with treatment depends on many factors, including patient satisfaction with medication, 
medication costs, ease of medication administration and patient understanding of the importance of 
taking their medication over the long term, although one of the most important factors is local and 
systemic side effects. (Honrubia et al, 2009). 
Currently, first-line treatment usually consists of monotherapy with a topical hypotensive drug. Although

to the possibility of producing systemic side effects, other therapeutic options are currently preferred, 
with prostaglandin analogues being one of the most widely used.  
The occurrence of conjunctival hyperaemia and other local ocular ADRs at such a high frequency in the 
netarsudil group when compared to timolol, although usually mild in intensity, is therefore of some 
concern because this may have a negative impact on whether the patient takes the proposed treatment 
as directed and complies with long term treatment over time. Nevertheless, the value of netarsudil in the 
treatment of glaucoma has to be considered in the context of existing treatments some of which have 
greater potential for systemic side effects. The ocular tolerability associated with netarsudil can be viewed 
in this context and the local adverse effects experienced with netarsudil can be clearly reflected in the 
product information. In addition, longer term safety of netarsudil will be followed through the proposed 
PASS. 
Non-ocular ADRs: 
When compared to ocular ADRs, non-ocular ADRs with netarsudil were infrequently observed in the 
clinical studies. 
In the phase 2 studies, the most frequently reported nonocular AEs across all netarsudil treatment groups 
included headache (1.3 to 4.8%) and nasopharyngitis (1.4 to 3.8%) which were reported at similar 
incidences for the latanoprost groups (1.4 to 2.6%) in these same studies. 
In the pooled safety analysis, the most frequently reported non-ocular AEs in the netarsudil treatment 
groups included upper respiratory infection (QD: 1.8%; BID: 3.1%), headache (QD: 1.5%; BID: 4.5%) 
and allergic dermatitis (QD: 0.5%; BID: 2.8%). Similarly, low incidences of these events were reported 
for the timolol group. 
Treatment-related non-ocular TEAEs were reported in single subjects within a treatment group with the 
exception of dermatitis allergic (netarsudil QD: 3 subjects, 0.4%), dermatitis contact (netarsudil QD: 5 
subjects, 0.6%), headache (netarsudil QD: 6 subjects, 0.7%, timolol: 2 subjects, 0.2%), dizziness 
(netarsudil BID: 2 subjects, 0.7%), dysgeusia (timolol: 3 subjects, 0.4%), bradycardia (timolol: 2 
subjects, 0.2%), nausea (timolol: 2 subjects, 0.2%), hypersensitivity (netarsudil QD: 2 subjects, 0.2%) 
and dyspnea (timolol: 3 subjects, 0.4%). 
No specific safety concerns arise. 
Serious AEs  
Serious AEs were infrequently reported and occurred at a similar frequency across the netarsudil and 
timolol treatment groups. The majority of cases were systemic rather than ocular reports. Based on the 
available PK data, netarsudil is unlikely to cause systemic effects due to negligible systemic absorption.  
Only two SAEs were considered as related to the study drug as reported by the investigator. The first case 
was a non-ocular case of an exacerbation of coronary artery disease. The case narrative for this SAE 
report indicates that the case was confounded by multiple co-morbid medical conditions including 
previous coronary artery disease. The second was a case iridocyclitis reported in the netarsudil 0.02% 
twice daily treatment group. 
No ocular SAE reported was considered related to netarsudil 0.02% at once daily dosage.  
Laboratory findings 
In the pooled safety population, more patients in the netarsudil treatment groups experienced loss of > 
3 lines of vision when compared to timolol. The rate was numerically higher and almost double in the 
netarsudil 0.02% QD treatment group and notably higher in the netarsudil 0.02% BD group (netarsudil 
Assessment report

QD =3.8%, netarsudil BD= 7.3% versus timolol 1.8%) when compared to timolol. However, no specific 
factors involved in loss of VA >3 lines could be established from the available data. It is recommended 
that this topic should continue to be routinely monitored. 
In the netarsudil treatment groups, 3 cases of corneal oedema were reported on slit lamp examination (1 
case in QD dose and 2 in the BD netarsudil treatment groups). No cases of corneal oedema were reported 
in the timolol group. Corneal staining on slit lamp examination was reported at a higher frequency in both 
netarsudil treatment groups when compared to timolol (netarsudil 0.02% QD = 2.2%, netarsudil 0.02% 
BD=2.9% versus timolol 0.5%).  This in line with the AEs reports findings. 
No safety concerns arise from the data related to Specular microscopy. No data from specular microscopy 
beyond 3 months duration of netarsudil treatment is available. 
The changes in heart rate and blood pressure across the netarsudil and timolol treatment groups were 
similar. Minor fluctuations in BP and HR did not result in discontinuation from treatment. Unsurprisingly, 
subjects in the timolol group experienced a statistically significant reduction in heart rate in line with its 
established mechanism of action. No new safety signals arise at this time. 
Safety in pregnancy/lactation 
No data on the use of netarsudil in pregnancy is available. One pregnancy case was reported in the clinical 
studies. No specific safety concerns were identified. This has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with netarsudil. Although, the applicant has 
provided general recommendations in the SmPC relating to the concomitant use of other topically 
administered ocular preparations, it is noted that these recommendations are largely based on 
extrapolation from general administration recommendations from other ocular medicines rather than on 
specific data from netarsudil use. As netarsudil is a new active substance, it would be preferable to further 
explore this topic and the applicant has agreed to further evaluate this issue through the PASS. 
In section 4.2 of the proposed SmPC, the applicant includes specific guidance for HCPs and patients 
outlining that a period of 5 minutes should be observed before other topical ocular preparations are 
administered following netarsudil administration.  Recommendation with regards to order of 
administration of the different ocular preparation is also included. 
Discontinuation for AE 
In the pooled safety population, the overall discontinuation rates were notably higher in the netarsudil 
treatment groups when compared to timolol (19.3% netarsudil 0.02% QD versus 1.7% for timolol). It 
was reported in the clinical studies that substantially higher discontinuation rates of over 50% were 
observed for netarsudil 0.02% when it was administered twice daily. This posology is not being pursued 
by the applicant. 
In relation to the dosage of interest, netarsudil 0.02% QD, discontinuation rates due to ocular AEs were 
still numerically higher when compared to timolol-5.8% of patients discontinued treatment due to 
conjunctival hyperaemia compared to none in the timolol group.The overall number of patients that 
discontinued study participation due to local ocular intolerance of the study medication was higher in the 
netarsudil group versus the timolol group. 
The SmPC adequately reflects data on discontinuation rates with netarsudil. Furthermore, this issue will 
be evaluated during the PASS.

Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the safety data for netarsudil 0.02% provided to date, it is clear that ocular ADRs are 
consistently reported at a higher rate in the netarsudil 0.02% treatment group when compared to timolol, 
although the greater potential for systemic AEs arising from topical  local absorption of timolol should be 
borne in mind. 
The specific ocular ADR arising from corneal deposits or corneal verticillata occurred specifically in the 
netarsudil treatment group only when compared to timolol. This finding was identified firstly during the 
long term phase 3 part of the clinical development programme for netarsudil and was further 
characterised during a follow up observational study in which the vast majority of cases of corneal 
verticillata resolved spontaneously without an impact on visual acuity. Nevertheless, further longer term 
data would be helpful in clarifying the longer term safety profile given the potential effects on the cornea 
associated with netarsudil and separately, the impact of BAK with long term use.   
In general, the higher rate of ocular ADRs seen with netarsudil 0.02% in the clinical studies and potential 
impact of these on discontinuation rates in the netarsudil population when compared to timolol would 
appear to indicate that there were local tolerability issues with netarsudil 0.02% when compared to 
timolol.  
The applicant has proposed a PASS to further evaluate the longer term safety of netarsudil. This is 
endorsed. 
Systemic ADRs occurred infrequently in the phase 3 studies and at a similar rate between netarsudil and 
timolol. 
It appears from the available clinical safety data that, while the overall ocular ADRs occurring with 
netarsudil were generally mild or moderate and often resolved spontaneously, the overall acceptability 
and tolerability of netarsudil could be considered lower when compared to timolol in respect of the notably 
higher frequency of ocular ADRs and higher discontinuation rates which occurred in the netarsudil 0.02% 
QD treatment population. 
In general, the percentage of patients experiencing ocular ADRs and discontinuations was even higher in 
the population treated with netarsudil 0.02% twice daily but this posology is not being pursued. 
The role of BAK in contributing to the overall nature and frequency of ocular ADRs seen in the netarsudil 
treatment groups is difficult to quantify. The applicant has outlined proposals to reduce the current 
concentration of BAK in the proposed product and the applicant has confirmed that the re-formulation is 
under active review. The current overview provided by the applicant in relation to the timeframe for 
re-formulation and subsequent clinical study to bridge to the new netarsudil formulation is considered 
broadly acceptable. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The applicant should conduct a PASS as detailed in the RMP to:  
•  Obtain estimates of the incidence and duration of specific adverse events (e.g. cornea 
verticillata, conjunctival haemorrhage and conjunctival hyperaemia) with long term use of 
Rhokiinsa;  
•  Determine whether specific events remain stable or progress with continued Rhokiinsa use  
•  Compare the incidence, severity and duration of specific adverse events following long-term

use with Rhokiinsa to the incidence following treatment with a PGA in this study 
•  Review the overall safety profile of netarsudil compared to the PGAs with long term use of the 
medications. 
The applicant is recommended to develop a new formulation with a reduced concentration of BAK and 
provide an update annually on the progress.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 (dated 19 September 2019) 
is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.12.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers netarsudil to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rhokiinsa (netarsudil) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Rhokiinsa (netarsudil 0.02%) is for the reduction of elevated intraocular 
pressure in open angle glaucoma or raised intraocular pression.  
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and can 
eventually lead to blindness due to progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting 
changes in the head of the optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in Europe. 
Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for approximately 74% of all glaucoma cases worldwide. In 
Europe the population prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma was estimated to be 2% in the 
population aged over 40 years in 2015.   
The objective of current therapy for open angle glaucoma is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). The 
target IOP is determined for each individual with the aim of achieving a pressure at which no further 
damage is likely to occur to the eye. Those with evidence of nerve damage or visual field impairment are 
likely to require a lower target IOP. 
There is evidence that IOP reduction reduces rate of progression in glaucoma (including those with 
normotensive glaucoma) and the incidence of glaucoma in those with intraocular hypertension. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
First line treatment for primary open angle glaucoma is usually topical pharmacological therapy. These 
products work either by decreasing aqueous fluid production (e.g. beta blockers, alpha adrenergic 
agonists) or increasing aqueous outflow (e.g. prostaglandins). Prostaglandins are the usual first line 
therapy to treat primary open angle glaucoma. A proportion of patients will fail to respond sufficiently to 
monotherapy and may require combination therapy of different drug classes to achieve their target IOP. 
Primary open angle glaucoma may also be treated with laser or surgical therapy in particular when 
pharmacological therapy has been insufficient. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted five efficacy studies. 2 phase II and 3 phase III studies.  All of the phase III 
studies and one phase II study were non-inferiority active controlled randomised trials. The first 
comparative controlled trials phase II study (CS202) used latanoprost as a comparator, given that this is 
first line pharmacological therapy for glaucoma this is deemed appropriate. Subsequent trials used 
Timolol as a control. 
The populations included in the phase III trials were broadly similar but not representative of the overall 
open angle glaucoma population in that no patients were included in the pivotal study with a maximum 
baseline IOP at or above 30mmHg and in the two other phase III trials the maximum baseline IOP had to 
be < 27 mmHg. In addition, patients who make up the majority of those with secondary open angle 
glaucoma i.e. those with pseudo-exfoliative or pigmentary glaucomas were excluded from all of the 
studies. Overall it would appear that included patients in the studies had either primary open angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
The study providing the main evidence of efficacy (CS304) was a multicentre randomised controlled 
non-inferiority study comparing netarsudil 0.02% (n = 351) with Timolol (n = 357) conducted in the US 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019 
Page 113/122

(Δ =1.5). The primary endpoint was evaluated in a smaller population (i.e. the PP population with 
maximum baseline IOP < 25mmHg) where n =186 in each treatment arm. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the primary efficacy population (per protocol population with maximum baseline IOP < 25mmg Hg) 
both treatments showed reduction from baseline in IOP at all of the post baseline time points assessed. 
Overall reduction from baseline was slightly greater from baseline for Timolol 0.5% than Netarsudil 
0.02%. 
In the Netarsudil 0.02% group mean reduction from baseline at the nine time points assessed ranged 
from 3.88mmHg to 4.74mmHg and for Timolol 0.5% from 3.77mmHg to 5.17mmHg.  
The upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals for the difference in IOP reduction between Netarsudil 
0.02% and Timolol 0.5% was < 1.5 mmHg at all-time points and < 1 mmHg at 8 out of 9 time points 
thereby demonstrating non-inferiority of Netarsudil 0.02% QD to Timolol 0.5% BID.  
Non-inferiority to timolol in a similar population (maximum baseline IOP < 25mmHg) was also 
demonstrated in CS301. 
Reports of treatment-related non-ocular AEs were minimal. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the pivotal study (CS304), netarsudil met the primary endpoint and demonstrated non-inferiority to 
timolol in the population with baseline IOP < 25mmHg. However, netarsudil was not statistically 
non-inferior to timolol in the total study population (Baseline IOP < 30 mmHg) with the upper 95% CI for 
one of the nine time points assessed just outside the non-inferiority margin of 1.5 (1.52). Whilst this from 
a strictly statistical point of view makes netarsudil not non-inferior to timolol in the per-protocol 
population with an IOP < 30mmHg, it is of lesser importance from a clinical point of view.  It is also 
acknowledged that non-inferiority was demonstrated in the Per-Protocol population when using an 
ANCOVA model using treatment as a factor and baseline as a covariate. 
The applicant has provided further data on efficacy in the population with baseline IOP ≥ 25 and < 30 
mmHg (from the phase III registration studies) and baseline IOP ≥ 30 and < 36mmHg (from PG324 
studies conducted with a fixed dose combination of netarsudil and latanoprost). The data from the 
AR-13324 Phase III studies and the supporting PG324 studies demonstrate that netarsudil lowers mean 
diurnal IOP by approximately 4 to 6 mmHg in subjects with baseline pressures ≥25 to <36 mmHg. This is 
broadly similar to the lowering effect in the < 25mm Hg baseline population in the pivotal study.  
There is very limited data on efficacy of netarsudil in those with pseudo-exfoliative or pigmentary 
glaucomas. This data is insufficient to support the inclusion of patients with seconday glaucoma such as 
pseudo-exfoliative or pigmentary in the overall, broad indication. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Across the pooled clinical safety studies, the following three ocular ADRs were consistently reported for 
netarsudil 0.02%: i) conjunctival hyperaemia, ii) corneal verticillata (deposits) and iii) conjunctival 
haemorrhage. 
While many of these ADRs were generally considered mild-moderate in intensity and many resolved 
spontaneously over time (though others occurred sporadically), the frequency of the three most 
commonly observed ocular ADRs in general was consistently found to be notably higher for netarsudil 
0.02% once daily when compared to the active comparator timolol. Ocular ADRs and discontinuation 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

rates increased further in patients treated with netarsudil 0.02% twice daily when compared to once daily 
dosing, although the twice daily dosing regimen for netarsudil 0.02% is not being sought by the applicant. 
Data from nonclinical studies indicated that the corneal deposits commonly observed in the clinical 
studies (in approximately 20% of patients treated with netarsudil) were reflected in a similar way in the 
nonclinical studies. The underlying process involved is understood to be phospholipidosis which is known 
to occur with other authorised medicines, most commonly amiodarone. Clinical data from an 
observational study on 45 patients who developed corneal deposits during netarsudil treatment in the 
phase 3 studies found that the majority of these cases resolved upon discontinuation of treatment and the 
presence of corneal verticillata did not generally impact on visual acuity. While this data is broadly 
reassuring, there is a concern about the absence of longer term data in these patients especially in the 
context of the proposed indication in glaucoma where longer term treatment with netarsudil would be 
anticipated. This will be addressed by the applicant through the proposed PASS and this is acceptable. 
There is some evidence from nonclinical studies that corneal erosion can occur with netarsudil treatment. 
In rabbit ocular studies, degeneration or erosion of the cornea was observed with netarsudil 
concentrations of 0.04% and above (twice daily administration). In one study these effects are described 
as corneal lesions consisting of peripheral vascularization, mixed cell inflammation, attenuation of the 
overlying corneal epithelium. 
While findings related to corneal erosion were not commonly observed in the clinical studies, a number of 
sporadic cases of corneal oedema and increased corneal staining were noted in the pooled safety data. 
The possible clinical relevance of the nonclinical findings is unclear especially in the context of longer term 
treatment with netarsudil and this can be further addressed through the PASS.  
Following the assessment of the applicant’s responses to non-clinical questions, a new point has been 
raised in relation to clinical safety following the review of nonclinical data which indicates a potential 
signal for phototoxicity arising from netarsudil use. The applicant discussed that possible clinical 
implications arising from this are unlikely but agreed to evaluate further through the PASS. 
In relation to the use of BAK in the proposed netarsudil product, the applicant has further discussed the 
proposed concentration of BAK and the rationale behind its inclusion in netarsudil 0.02%. In view of 
clinical concerns relating to long term use of BAK, the applicant has considered the potential impact of 
BAK on the overall benefit-risk of the product, particularly in the context of the need for continuous long 
term therapy in glaucoma patients. In this context, the applicant has outlined proposals to 
reduce/remove BAK in line with previous CHMP SA. The applicant has submitted a proposal for a revised 
bridging study using the new formulation based on previous SA. This is broadly acceptable.  
The discontinuation rates in the longer duration Phase III studies were higher than in Phase II. In the 
Phase III studies a greater proportion of subjects in the netarsudil groups compared with the timolol 
group discontinued study participation prior to completing the study (15.3% QD vs. 6.2% timolol in 
AR-13324-CS301; 41.8% QD; 66.1% BID vs. 18.7% timolol in AR-13324-CS302; 52.9% QD; 88.9% BID 
vs. 17.4% timolol in AR-13324-CS303; and 30.8% QD vs. 12.0% timolol in AR-13324-CS304). 
In the pooled population, the majority of discontinued netarsudil QD and BID subjects were discontinued 
due to AEs (174/264 [65.9%] and 161/198 [81.3%], respectively).  
The most frequent reason for discontinuation of timolol subjects was AE and withdrawal of consent, each 
26.4% (28/106 subjects). Non-compliance with study medication and lack of efficacy were observed in 
only small numbers of subjects across treatment groups and studies. 
In the pooled analysis of the 4 AR-13324 Phase 3 studies, a total of 575 (68.5%) netarsudil QD, 91 
(31.5%) netarsudil BID and 733 (87.4%) timolol BID subjects completed the full study duration. 
Conversely, a greater proportion of subjects discontinued study participation in the netarsudil groups

(31.5% QD, 68.5% BID) compared to timolol (12.6%). The most frequent reason for discontinuation was 
AE: 65.9% netarsudil QD, 81.4% netarsudil BID, and 26.4% timolol. 
In the pooled analysis, discontinuations of test article due to TEAEs were highest in the netarsudil BID 
group (54.3%) followed by netarsudil QD group (19.3%,) and timolol group (1.7%).  
The majority of discontinuations in the netarsudil QD and BID groups were associated with ocular events, 
whereas the majority of discontinuations in the timolol groups were associated with non-ocular events. 
The most frequently reported (≥5% of subjects) TEAEs associated with discontinuation in the netarsudil 
groups were conjunctival hyperaemia (QD: 5.8%; BID: 26.3%), cornea verticillata (QD: 3.7%; BID: 
10.0%), and vision blurred (QD: 1.4%; BID: 6.9%). 
In the pooled safety analysis, non-ocular ADRs were infrequently reported. The most frequently reported 
non-ocular AEs in the netarsudil treatment groups included upper respiratory infection (QD: 1.8%; BID: 
3.1%), headache (QD: 1.5%; BID: 4.5%) and allergic dermatitis (QD: 0.5%; BID: 2.8%). Similarly, low 
incidences of these events were reported for the timolol group. 
Serious AEs with netarsudil were very uncommon. One serious ocular AE reported with netarsudil 
occurred at the twice daily dosage which is not being pursued with the application. 
Long-term safety data was provided in the 3, 6 and 12-month Phase 3 studies (netarsudil QD (636 
subjects) and timolol (631 subjects). Within the netarsudil treatment group, 361 subjects were exposed 
to netarsudil 0.02% once daily for a duration of 6 months to 12 months. In addition, a total of 252 
subjects completed over 12 months of therapy with netarsudil 0.02% once daily.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Based on the safety data for netarsudil 0.02% provided to date, it is clear that the previously identified 
ocular ADRs are consistently reported at a higher rate in the netarsudil 0.02% treatment group when 
compared to timolol. 
The ocular ADR arising from corneal deposits or corneal verticillata, occurred specifically in the netarsudil 
treatment group when compared to timolol. This finding was identified firstly during the long term phase 
III part of the clinical development programme for netarsudil and was further characterised during a 
follow up observational study in which the vast majority of cases of corneal verticillata resolved 
spontaneously without an impact on visual acuity. Nevertheless, further longer term data would be 
helpful in clarifying the longer term safety profile given the potential effects on the cornea. This issue can 
be addressed further through the proposed PASS to assess longer term safety of netarsudil 0.02% once 
daily administration in the treatment of glaucoma. 
In general, the higher rate of ocular ADRs observed with netarsudil 0.02% in the clinical studies and 
potential impact of these on discontinuation rates in the netarsudil population when compared to timolol 
would appear to indicate that there were local tolerability issues with netarsudil 0.02% when compared to 
timolol.  
Systemic ADRs occurred infrequently in the phase III studies and at a similar rate between netarsudil and 
timolol. 
It appears from the available clinical safety data that, while the overall ocular ADRs occurring with 
netarsudil were generally mild or moderate and often resolved spontaneously, the overall acceptability 
and tolerability of netarsudil was lower when compared to timolol in respect of the notably higher 
Assessment report

frequency of ocular ADRs and higher discontinuation rates which occurred in the netarsudil 0.02% QD 
treatment population. 
In general, the percentage of patients experiencing ocular ADRs and discontinuations was even higher in 
the population treated with netarsudil 0.02% twice daily but this posology is not being pursued. 
The role of BAK in contributing to the overall nature and frequency of ocular ADRs seen in the netarsudil 
treatment groups is unclear. However, BAK can disrupt the epithelial layers of the cornea and conjunctiva, 
decrease the goblet cell numbers within the conjunctiva and alter the permeability of cell membranes 
therefore, it cannot be excluded that both efficacy and safety are influenced by the difference in the BAK 
concentration. The current Rhokiinsa formulation contains 0.015% benzalkonium chloride (BAK). The 
concentration of BAK included in the proposed formulation is similar to approved products in Europe.  
The BAK issue was discussed in previous SA procedures (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432860/2017) and 
clarification advice (EMA/520545/2017. EMA CHMP SA conclusion endorsed the approach to decrease 
BAK concentration in an effort to improve safety. The need for a bridging study and scientific justification 
to support future re-formulation would in principle address this and this was discussed during the SA 
procedure.In the responses to the clinical safety query on BAK, the applicant acknowledged the potential 
for future improvements on the benefit risk profile of the product as regards the concentration of this 
preservative. While the applicant maintains that the safety of the existing concentration is widely 
established and in line with other approved products, which is acknowledged, given the ocular tolerability 
profile of the current formulation, the applicant was asked to further discuss and update on the feasibility 
of enhancing the benefit-risk of netarsudil 0.02% by specifically reviewing the issue of BAK in the context 
of the EMA SA advice, in order to optimise the benefit-risk profile in the proposed indication, especially in 
the context of long term treatment of OAG/OHT. In this context, the applicant is actively reviewing the 
situation with respect to BAK concentrations in the current formulation. An overview of the applicant’s 
proposals to re-formulate and conduct a bridging study following on from previous CHMP SA 
recommendations has been presented and is broadly endorsed.  
Since netarsudil is a new active substance for the topical treatment of glaucoma, a condition which 
generally requires chronic long term treatment, there is a concern that some adverse events either 
already established or evolving could occur or worsen after several months to years of dosing (eg. 
possible adverse impact of long-term corneal deposition on visual acuity, punctate keratitis, potential for 
periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discolouration/ iris hyperpigmentation due to possible melanin 
binding, and adverse changes in the cornea due to chronic administration of BAK), therefore the overall 
duration of exposure to the proposed product is considered somewhat limited in the context of the 
proposed indication in glaucoma. The applicant acknowledges the absence of longer term data with 
netarsudil treatment in glaucoma and has proposed to conduct a PASS to address this issue.  This is 
agreed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Netarsudil is a new topical anti-glaucoma medicinal product with a different mode of action to previously 
authorised topical products and as such provides an alternative treatment option.  
Netarsudil has demonstrated similar IOP lowering effects in clinical studies across a range of baseline 
IOPs (< 25mmgHg, ≥ 25 and < 30 mmHg, ≥ 30 and < 36mmHg). It is acknowledged that non-inferiority 
to timolol was only demonstrated in a population with baseline IOP < 25 mmHg, though failure to 
demonstrate non-inferiority in the overall study population (<30mmHg at baseline) was marginal, and 
data in the population without IOP ≥ 30 and < 36mmHg has been obtained from studies for a fixed dose 
combination of netarsudil and latanoprost. 
Whilst a broad indication for open angle glaucoma is sought, patients with pseudoexfoliative or 
pigmentary glaucoma were excluded from all of the phase 2 and 3 studies submitted in this application, 
therefore there is extremely limited data to support use in this population. Therefore, the applicant has 
agreed to a revised indication wording to reflect the available data.

Unfavourable effects reported in the safety population mostly relate to ocular ADRs. Although frequently 
mild-moderate in intensity, these ocular ADRs occurred in a notably higher percentage of patients treated 
with netarsudil 0.02% once daily when compared to timolol. Rates of discontinuation were in general 
higher in the netarsudil 0.02% treatment group also. These topics have been reflected in the final 
netarsudil product information.  
There was a concern that the unfavourable effects observed in the netarsudil treatment group could 
impact on overall tolerability of netarsudil in the long term and this may have implications for long term 
compliance with treatment, which is crucial given the target indication in glaucoma. 
Therefore, the applicant has agreed to further evaluate the issue of long term safety of netarsudil, 
including the impact of ocular ADRs on continuation of treatment longer term, during the PASS which will 
be conducted post-approval. 
Potential unfavourable effects arising from the long term use of BAK as part of netarsudil treatment are 
also noted. The applicant is actively reviewing this issue and has presented plans to re-formulate the 
product to remove or reduce BAK concentration as a post-approval measure, in line with previous CHMP 
SA recommendations. This is endorsed. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Netarsudil has a different mode of action to already authorised topical anti-glaucoma products and 
provides another treatment option. The initiation of the treatment is therefore restricted to 
ophthalmologists or healthcare professionals qualified in ophthalmology. Efficacy has been demonstrated 
across a range of baseline IOPS though other products such as timolol and latanoprost show greater 
efficacy at higher baseline IOPs than netarsudil. Nevertheless, the applicant has demonstrated that some 
patients with higher baseline IOP levels demonstrated substantial reduction in baseline IOP (> 7mmHg).  
There is minimal data on efficacy in those with pseudoexfoliative or pigmentary glaucoma as those 
patients were excluded from clinical studies; therefore the inclusion of these patients in the sought 
indication is not supported. The applicant has agreed to reflect this in the final wording for the indication. 
The overall safety profile of netarsudil 0.02% was dominated by ocular ADRs. The key findings related to 
three ocular ADRs which were commonly reported with netarsudil-conjunctival hyperaemia, corneal 
verticillata and conjunctival haemorrhage. 
Whilst these ADRs were in general mild-moderate in intensity and often resolved spontaneously, they 
occurred at a notably higher frequency when compared to timolol. 
There is a concern that the unfavourable effects observed in the netarsudil treatment group could impact 
on overall tolerability of netarsudil and this may have implications for long term compliance with 
treatment. This issue should be considered in view of the proposed treatment in glaucoma and the 
importance of compliance with chronic treatment. Nevertheless, it is considered that this concern is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC/label and will be further followed in the proposed PASS to further 
evaluate longer term safety of netarsudil in the proposed indication. 
Also, the less favourable ocular tolerability profile associated with netarsudil in the clinical studies has to 
be balanced against the potential for systemic ADRs which can be associated with other ocular treatments 
for glaucoma but are less likely with netarsudil in view of its negligible systemic absorption. 
Potential unfavourable effects arising from the long term use of BAK as part of netarsudil treatment are 
noted. This topic was the discussed in detail during the previous CHMP SA on netarsudil, however as the 
current BAK concentration is in line with other authorised topical ocular products, this was not seen as 
barrier to authorisation. Nevertheless, the applicant acknowledged the previous SA recommendations to 
Assessment report  
EMA/545191/2019

consider reducing BAK concentration in netarsudil. In this context, the applicant confirmed that the issue 
of BAK concentration reduction is under active review. It is acknowledged that the applicant plans to 
re-formulate to remove or reduce the BAK concentration are progressing and an outline of the 
recommended clinical study to bridge to the re-formulated product has been presented. This is considered 
broadly acceptable. It is recommended that the applicant provides an update to the Rapporteur on an 
annual basis in relation to how the re-formulation to reduce/remove BAK concentration is progressing. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rhokiinsa is positive for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult 
patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Rhokiinsa is favourable in the following indication: 
Rhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with 
primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance in Eylea is aflibercept (also referred to as VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap Eye), a 
recombinant fusion protein consisting of ligand binding regions within the extracellular domains of the 
human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) linked to the Fc domain of human 
immunoglobulin IgG1. More specifically, aflibercept comprises immunoglobulin domain 2 from VEGFR1 
fused to Ig domain 3 from VEGFR2, which in turn is fused to the constant region of a human IgG1.  
Aflibercept binds multiple isoforms of VEGF-A and placental growth factor-2 (PlGF-2) which are 
members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and 
vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells, producing pathological neovascularization, excessive 
vascular permeability, and vascular inflammation. 
Eylea has been approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area under the centralised 
procedure by Commission Decision on 22 November 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The indication was later extended by 
Commission Decision on 26 August 2013 and on 6 August 2014 to include treatment of adult patients 
with visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 6/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eylea is a solution for injection available in vials or pre-filled syringes. The recommended dose is 2 mg 
aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitrers given intravitreally (IVT). 
With this application, the MAH sought the addition of a new indication in adult patients with “visual 
impairment due to macular oedema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)”. In support of 
this application, the MAH submitted results from the VIBRANT Phase III study, which compared the use 
of Eylea in patient with macular oedema secondary to BRVO compared to grid laser photocoagulation.  
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disorder after diabetic 
retinopathy, and is a significant cause of visual impairment. RVO is classified depending on the location 
of the occlusion. While CRVO involves a blockage of the central retinal vein, BRVO is defined as retinal 
haemorrhage or other biomicroscopic evidence of RVO (e.g. telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated 
(or previously dilated) venous system in 1 quadrant or less of the retina drained by the affected vein. 
RVO has a characteristic appearance on fundus examination. Hemi-retinal vein occlusion (HRVO) may 
be regarded as a variant of BRVO that involves an obstruction of 2 altitudinal quadrants. Therefore, 
eyes diagnosed with HRVO are often treated in the same way as eyes with BRVO.  
Worldwide approximately 2.5 million people are affected by CRVO and 13.9 million people are affected 
by BRVO (Rogers et al., Ophthalmology, 2010), which is the most common type of RVO.  
RVO, as a variety of other ocular diseases, is associated with excess production of VEGF, with resultant 
vascular leakage, formation of endothelial blood vessels and/or thickening and oedema of the retina, 
which are thought to contribute to vision loss. Sight-threatening complications of RVO include 
persistent macular oedema and neovascularization in some cases of extensively affected quadrants. 
Compared to CRVO, BRVO carries a lower risk of progressive worsening and conversion to 
ischemia/non perfusion and a lower risk of neovascularization. However, retinal neovascularization still 
occurs in 36% of eyes with an area of non perfusion > 5 disc diameters (The Branch Vein Occlusion 
Study Group 1986, Arch Ophthalmol).  
Some forms of BRVO including macular BRVO and BRVO with a perfused periphery and normal visual 
acuity do not require treatment in most cases. However, appropriate treatment should be considered if 
macular oedema exists. In addition to the management of systemic risk factors, grid laser 
photocoagulation has been the standard of care for many years. Other treatment options include 
surgical approaches, intravitreal corticosteroids and anti-VEGF inhibitors which have become the new 
gold standard.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1), since aflibercept is a protein and unlikely to result in a significant risk to 
the environment, Eylea is exempted from an environmental risk assessment.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The proposed VEGF Trap-Eye formulation for IVT use in the BRVO indication is the same iso-osmotic 
formulation already approved for use in wet AMD, CRVO and DME. The pharmacokinetic (PK) 
characteristics of this formulation have been extensively investigated in the context of the assessment 
of the previously approved indications and the MAH made reference to data presented in support of the 
application for use in wet AMD (VIEW 2) and CRVO (GALILEO).  
The applicant furthermore provided some new PK data from the phase III study VIBRANT regarding 
systemic exposure in BRVO patients. Within VIBRANT, a sub-study was conducted with sparse 
sampling in 21 Japanese patients to explore the systemic exposure of free and VEGF-bound VEGF Trap 
receiving 2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye every 4 weeks for a duration of 24 weeks. A summary of the methods 
and results for the PK analysis is given below. A detailed description of the VIBRANT study is provided 
in section 2.4.2.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 8/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods 
Blood samples were drawn at baseline (Study Day 1) and after the first 2 mg IVT dose or sham 
treatment on Days 2-4 and on Day 8 (Week 1), as well as at trough time points on Days 85 (Week 12) 
and 169 (Week 24). 
The analytical methods used in the BRVO development program were the same as previously described 
and assessed in the AMD and CRVO programs. Free VEGF Trap and bound VEGF Trap plasma 
concentrations were measured using validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The 
assay for bound VEGF Trap was calibrated using VEGF:VEGF Trap complex standards. The lower limit 
of quantification (LLOQ) for the free and adjusted bound assays was 0.0156 mg/L and 0.0315 mg/L, 
respectively. 
Results 
Of the 21 Japanese patients included in the sub-study, 10 received laser/sham treatment and 11 
received VEGF Trap-Eye. Of these 21 patients, 15 were males, and 6 females, between the ages of 
53 and 85 years and with an average body weight of 59.6 kg. 
No patients were found to have detectable concentrations of free or bound VEGF Trap at baseline. No 
detectable concentrations of free or bound VEGF Trap were observed at any time point in the 
sham/laser treatment group. 
Detectable concentrations of free VEGF Trap were observed in at least one post-treatment time point in 
10 of the 11 VEGF Trap-Eye-treated patients (91%). Detectable concentrations of free VEGF Trap were 
only observed during the first week of treatment with 10 out of 11 patients at visit 2 (Study Day 2-4) 
and 7 out of 11 patients at visit 3 (Study Day 8). No patients were observed to have detectable 
concentrations of free VEGF Trap at a later visit (Study Day 85 and day 169). The mean (±SD, range) 
concentration of free VEGF Trap on Day 2-4 and Day 8 were 0.0497 (±0.0357, 0-0.136) mg/L and 
0.0147 (±0.0148, 0-0.0494) mg/L, respectively. All detectable concentrations of free VEGF Trap were 
low, with the highest concentration being 0.136 mg/L.  
Bound VEGF Trap was detectable in at least one post-treatment time-point in all 11 VEGF Trap-Eye 
treated patients, and most of the patients had detectable concentrations of bound VEGF Trap 
throughout the 24- week reporting period (up until Day 169), though with no indication of 
accumulation beyond Study Day 85. By the end of the first week (Study Day 8), the mean (±SD, 
range) concentration of adjusted bound VEGF Trap was 0.142 (±0.0387, 0.0806-0.194) mg/L, 
increasing to 0.168 (±0.0514, 0.0667-0.260) mg/L on Study Day 85, and remained relatively constant 
thereafter, with a mean (±SD, range) concentration of 0.181 (±0.0603, 0.0803-0.296) mg/L on Study 
Day 169. Except for three patients, all concentrations of adjusted bound VEGF Trap were within 6-fold 
of the LLOQ of 0.0315 mg/L. However, even in the three patients the highest concentrations measured 
did not exceed the LLOQ by more than 9-fold.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
As in the AMD, DME and CRVO program, the clinical pharmacology program for BRVO evaluated and 
differentiated between the local ocular and systemic pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of VEGF Trap-Eye 
after IVT administration. Data in patients with BRVO were available from the Phase III study VIBRANT. 
The ocular PD effect (improvement in macular oedema) was assessed by measurement of central 
retinal thickness (CRT) using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Blood pressure measurement was 
used as a surrogate marker of systemic effects. Finally, the immunogenic potential of VEGF Trap in 
DME patients was investigated.  
The results for CRT and blood pressure (events of hypertension) from VIBRANT are presented in 
sections 2.4. and 2.5. In summary, a rapid decrease in CRT was observed that was sustained 
throughout the treatment period (24 weeks). The incidence of hypertension as an adverse event (AE) 
was similar in the laser and the active treatment arm. 
A summary of the immunogenicity data is provided below. 
Immunogenicity 
Methods 
A validated anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay was utilised to analyse samples. This was a bridging 
immunoassay that was used throughout all Phase III studies for the BRVO, CRVO and wet AMD clinical 
development programs. Furthermore, a neutralising anti-VEGF Trap antibody (NAb) assay was applied 
to examine neutralising activity in ADA positive samples identified in the bridging immunoassay. This 
validated competitive ligand-binding assay incorporated a VEGF ELISA as an indirect method to 
determine the presence of NAbs that prevents the binding of VEGF to VEGF Trap. Results from this 
Assessment report

Page 10/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assay are reported as either positive or negative. The same assay was used in previous studies with 
VEGF Trap. 
Blood samples were collected from all 181 patients in the VIBRANT study (91 in the VEGF Trap group 
and 90 in the laser group) pre-dose on Days 1, 169 (week 24), and 365 (week 52, end of study) or at 
early termination.  
Results 
Two (2) of the 181 patients in VIBRANT had a pre-existing immunoreactivity in the ADA assay prior to 
the first administration of study drug. One patient from the laser treatment arm and one patient from 
the VEGF Trap-Eye treatment arm were positive in the ADA assay on both Days 1 and 169, with all 
samples demonstrating a low ADA titer of 30 (the minimum in the assay). Therefore, no treatment-
emergent positive ADA response was associated with this study. None of the samples that were 
positive in the ADA assay demonstrated neutralizing activity. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP acknowledged that the PK, PD and immunology profile of VEGF Trap had already been 
investigated in the context of previous applications for other indications of Eylea and data from studies 
in the other indications was considered supportive for the present application. The analytical methods 
used in the BRVO development program were the same as previously described and assessed in the 
AMD, DME and CRVO programs. The performances of the methods were considered satisfactory. 
For BRVO patients, only very limited PK data were available from sparse sampling in a small sub-study 
of the phase III trial VIBRANT. Detectable levels were observed only during the first week after 
injection. In one patient, one plasma levels was around 10 fold the LLOQ. All other detectable 
concentrations were within a range of 5.5 fold of the LLOQ. Overall, the results appeared to be 
comparable to those observed in AMD, CRVO, and DME patients and therefore no specific PK-related 
concerns were raised. However, considering the limited number of observations in BRVO patients, the 
CHMP was of the opinion that conclusions on the clinical significance could only be drawn when 
considering the data on systemic tolerability (see section 2.5). 
With regards to the immunogenic potential of VEGF Trap in the BRVO population, the CHMP noted that 
only 1 patient out of the 91 subjects treated with VEGF Trap, exhibited a positive response in the ADA 
assay. The titer was low and no neutralising activity was detected. While no meaningful conclusions 
could be drawn regarding the impact of positive ADA findings on the efficacy and safety of VEGF Trap 
injections, the CHMP was of the opinion that the available data did not raise further concerns with 
regards to immunogenicity, and that the immunogenic potential of Eylea in BRVO patients could be 
expected to be similar to that observed in CRVO, DME, or wet AMD patients. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology program in support of this application was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. The PK/PD profile and immunogenicity of VEGF Trap in BRVO patients appear to be 
comparable to other target populations of already approved indications for Eylea. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Data supporting the clinical efficacy of VEGF Trap in the treatment of BRVO were derived from the 
phase III VIBRANT study . VIBRANT was on-going at the time of submission of this application and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 11/67 
 
 
 
 
 
initially only data for 6 months were available. The final study report including 12 months data was 
submitted during the evaluation procedure upon request of the CHMP. 
Clinical and statistical superiority of Eylea over sham has previously been demonstrated in patients 
with visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to CRVO and reference was made to 
relevant data from the pivotal phase III trials COPERNICUS and GALILEO. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose finding study was conducted in support of the BRVO indication. The rationale for the final dose 
selection of 2 mg IVT injections of VEGF Trap-Eye every month (2Q4) for the first 24 weeks in the 
phase III trial VIBRANT, was based on the favourable safety and efficacy profile seen in the phase III 
pivotal CRVO studies COPERNICUS and GALILEO. In addition, after analysis of the results from 
previous pivotal studies conducted with VEGF Trap-Eye including studies in CRVO patients and based 
on a similar reasoning, an extended treatment interval every 8 weeks (2Q8) after week 24 was 
deemed appropriate and therefore selected by the applicant to be used in VIBRANT. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Study VGFTe-RVO-1027 (VIBRANT): A Double-Masked, Randomized, Active-
Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Intravitreal 
Administration of VEGF Trap-Eye (Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection [IAI]) 
in Patients with Macular Edema Secondary to Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion 
Methods 
Study participants 
Approximately 180 subjects were planned to be randomised at approximately 63 study sites in North 
America (United States, Canada) and Japan.  
The target population included adults ≥18 years of age with unilateral macular oedema following BRVO 
or HRVO involving the centre of the macula, with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of 
73 to 24 (20/40 to 20/320) in the study eye. 
The main inclusion criteria were:  
•  Adults ≥18 years of age with foveal centre-involved macular oedema following BRVO 
diagnosed within 12 months before the screening visit (BRVO was defined as an eye with 
retinal haemorrhage or other biomicroscopic evidence of RVO [eg, telangiectatic capillary bed] 
and a dilated [or previously dilated] venous system in 1 quadrant or less of the retina drained 
by the affected vein. Eyes with HRVO were eligible for enrolment and treated the same as eyes 
with BRVO). 
• 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA: letter score of 73 to 24 (20/40 to 
20/320) in the study eye at screening and at day 1. 
The main exclusion criteria were: 
•  History of vitreoretinal surgery in the study eye or anticipated within 12 months of day 1. 
•  Current bilateral manifestation of BRVO. 
•  Decrease in visual acuity (VA) due to causes other than BRVO in the study eye. 
Assessment report

•  Uncontrolled blood pressure (defined as systolic >160 mm Hg or diastolic >95 mm Hg while 
patient is sitting). 
•  Uncontrolled glaucoma defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥25 mm Hg in the study eye, or 
previous filtration surgery in either the study eye or the fellow eye (if needed, patients could 
be rescreened after IOP was brought under control). 
•  Only 1 functional eye, even if that eye was otherwise eligible for study. 
•  Other conditions with a poorer prognosis for vision in the fellow eye than in the study eye. 
• 
Insufficient clearing of macular haemorrhage that would prevent the patient from receiving 
laser treatment safely on day 1 (patients that met this criterion could be rescreened once the 
macular haemorrhage resolved). 
•  History or presence of AMD (dry or wet form) that was considered by the investigator to 
significantly affect central vision in the study eye. 
•  Diabetic macular oedema (DME) or diabetic retinopathy, defined in diabetic patients with more 
than 1 microaneurysm outside the area of the vein occlusion in the study eye and anywhere in 
the retina of the fellow eye. 
• 
(a) Iris neovascularisation, vitreous haemorrhage, traction retinal detachment in either eye; 
(b) preretinal fibrosis involving the macular in either eye. 
•  Vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membrane in either the study eye or fellow eye evident 
biomicroscopically or on optical coherence tomography (OCT) that was considered by the 
investigator to significantly affect central vision. 
•  Ocular inflammation (including trace, or above, cells in the anterior chamber and/or vitreous) 
or external ocular inflammation in the study eye. 
•  History of idiopathic or autoimmune uveitis in either eye. 
•  Structural damage to the centre of the macula in either eye that was likely to preclude 
improvement in VA following the resolution of macular oedema. 
•  Concurrent disease in the study eye that would compromise VA or require medical or surgical 
intervention during the study period. 
•  Cataract surgery in the study eye within 3 months, yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser 
capsulotomy within the past 2 months, or any other intraocular surgery within 3 months before 
day 1. 
•  Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye. 
•

Patients randomised to the VEGF Trap-Eye arm received: 
•  A sham laser treatment at Day 1 
•  2Q4 IVT injections of 2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye on Day 1 and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 
•  2Q8 IVT injections of 2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye at Weeks 24, 32, 40, and 48 
•  Q8 sham IVT injections at Weeks 28, 36, and 44 
Patients randomized to the laser arm received: 
•  A laser treatment at Day 1 
•  Q4 sham IVT injections on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. 
Patients assigned to the laser group will be treated with laser wavelengths between 488 to 532 
nm, as follows: 
o  Grid pattern laser photocoagulation: Applied to areas of leakage outside the foveal 
avascular zone using fluorescence angiography as a guide. 
o  Peripheral scatter laser photocoagulation: Applied to the quadrant of BRVO (or 
quadrants of HRVO). All patients are eligible to receive scatter laser photocoagulation 
(per standard of care) at any time during the study if and when they develop clinically 
relevant ocular neovascularization, for example. 
o  PASCAL (pattern scan laser) can be used for both grid and scatter, but should be 
modified to be used as a single spot size administration to comply with the method of 
treatment of the argon laser described below. 
Photocoagulation techniques were in line with the treatment approach described in the 
Combined Branch Vein Occlusion Study (CBVOS) and commonly used in clinical practice. 
Rescue treatment 
Starting at Week 12, all patients were evaluated for the following rescue treatment criteria: 
•  More than 50μm increase in central retinal thickness (CRT) on optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) compared to the lowest previous measurement. 
•  New or persistent cystic retinal changes or sub-retinal fluid on OCT or persistent diffuse 
oedema in the central subfield on OCT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 15/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A loss of 5 or more letters in VA from the best previous measurement due to BRVO, in 
conjunction with any increase in retinal thickness in the central subfield on OCT from the best 
previous measurement. 
The dosing schedule for patients who met at least 1 rescue treatment criterion was to be given as 
follows: 
•  Subjects in the laser arm became eligible for laser rescue treatment at Week 12: Active laser 
could be given at Week 12, 16, 20 (12 weeks must have passed since last active laser). 
•  Subjects in the laser arm became eligible for rescue treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye at 
Week 24, and received 3 initial monthly 2 mg IVT injections (2Q4) followed by 2 mg IVT 2Q8. 
•  Subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye arm could only receive rescue laser treatment if they met 
criteria at Week 36. 
All subjects were eligible to receive scatter laser photocoagulation (per standard of care) at any time 
during the study if and when they developed clinically relevant ocular neovascularisation. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye in improving 
BCVA compared to laser treatment, in subjects with macular oedema following BRVO. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye in subjects with 
macular oedema following BRVO 
To assess the effects of IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye on CRT in subjects with macular 
oedema following BRVO 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint in the study was the proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in 
BCVA at Week 24 from baseline. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
•  Change from baseline in BCVA score at Week 24. 
•  Change from baseline in CRT, assessed by OCT, at Week 24. 
•  Change from baseline in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-
25) total score at Week 24. 
The additional endpoints were: 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a decrease in retinal ischemia through Week 24, as assessed by the 
reduction in the area of non-perfused retina on fluorescence angiography. 
Time to first gain of at least 15 letters from baseline, defined as the time of first treatment 
(active or sham) until the date when a gain of at least 15 letters compared to baseline, is 
reached through Week 24. Subjects who did not have a gain of at least 15 ETDRS letters were 
censored at the visit date of their last BCVA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 16/67 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Time to first confirmed gain of at least 15 letters from baseline. A subject was considered to 
have a confirmed gain at the time the subject first had a gain of at least 15 ETDRS letters, 
which was confirmed by the next scheduled ETDRS measurement through Week 24. Subjects 
who did not have a confirmed gain of at least 15 ETDRS letters were censored at the visit of 
their second-to-last BCVA measurement. 
•  Retinal fluid status as assessed by OCT through Week 24. The status was "dry" if neither 
intraretinal fluid nor subretinal fluid was present. The status was "not dry" if either intraretinal 
fluid or subretinal fluid was present. Otherwise, the status was "indeterminate". 
•  Change from baseline in the Euro QOL-5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) Questionnaire at 
Week 24. 
•  Change from baseline in scores for NEI VFQ-25 subscales (distance activities, near activities, 
and visual dependency) at Week 24. 
All endpoints, except the additional endpoints for EQ-5D and NEI VFQ-25 subscales were also 
evaluated at Week 52 (exploratory endpoints). 
Sample size 
Based on the publication by Campochiaro et al., Mol Ther. 2010, it was assumed that the proportion of 
patients with at least a 15 letter increase in the VEGF Trap-Eye arm would be 55%. Furthermore, 
based on the SCORE study Research Group (Arch Opthalmol 2009) the proportion of patients with at 
least a 15 letter increase in the laser arm was estimated to be 30%. A sample size of 81 patients per 
arm would therefore provide 90% power for rejecting the null hypothesis at a 2-sided 5% significant 
level using a Chi-square test. If a drop-out rate of 10% was considered. Hence, 90 patients per arm 
and a total sample size of 180 patients were calculated to be needed. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to either the VEGF Trap-Eye arm or the laser arm 
according to a pre-determined central randomisation scheme provided by the interactive voice 
response system /interactive web response system to the designated unmasked personnel. 
Randomisation was stratified according to region (Japan and North America) and baseline BCVA 
(>20/200 and ≤20/200). 
Blinding (masking) 
Sham injections and sham laser therapy were performed to preserve the mask. A masked physician 
was assigned to assess adverse events (AEs), perform the masked assessment of efficacy, and to 
assess rescue treatment criteria. A separate unmasked physician administered treatment (i.e., 
performed study drug injection, sham injection, laser/sham photocoagulation). The unmasked 
physician or designee did not have any role in the study beyond the receipt, tracking, preparation, 
administration, and destruction of study drug, and safety assessment during the observation period 
following study drug administration. 
Emergency unmasking of treatment assignment for a subject due to a medical emergency, a serious 
adverse event (SAE) that was unexpected or for which a causal relationship to study drug could not be 
ruled out, or any other significant medical event (e.g., pregnancy) was permitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015

The sponsor team (or designee) performing the primary analysis was involved in the study until 
unmasking for the primary analysis. Management of the study was then transferred to clinical, 
biostatistics, and data management personnel who continue to be masked through study end. 
Statistical methods 
Populations for analysis: 
• 
• 
• 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomised subjects who received any investigational 
product and had a baseline BCVA assessment and at least one post-baseline BCVA assessment. 
The FAS will be the primary efficacy analysis set. All efficacy endpoints were analysed using the 
FAS. 
The per protocol set (PPS) included all subjects in the FAS except those subjects who were 
excluded due to major protocol deviations. A major protocol deviation was defined as a 
deviation that may affect the interpretation of study results. Analysis of the PPS will be 
performed according to the treatment actually received (as treated).  
The safety analysis set (SAF) included all randomised subjects who received any investigational 
product and was based on the treatment received (as treated). 
The primary analysis was conducted on the FAS. The 2 groups were compared using the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test with stratification adjustment for geographic region (Japan and North America) 
and baseline BCVA (letter score of 35 to 73 and 24 to 34 [>20/200 and ≤20/200]). A 2-sided 95% 
Mantel-Haenszel confidence interval (CI) for the difference of proportions, adjusted for region and 
baseline BCVA was calculated using normal approximation. Missing data was imputed using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF approach). 
Additional analysis of the primary endpoint was also performed on the PPS to support the FAS. 
To assess the robustness of the main analysis results, the following sensitivity analyses were 
performed to address the impact of missing data due to drop-outs. 
- Observed case analysis based on the FAS (these were performed for all efficacy endpoints).  
- Multiple imputation analysis based on the FAS.  
Secondary efficacy analyses involving analyses of continuous variables used an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with baseline measurement as covariates and treatment group, region and baseline 
BCVA category (>20/200 [35-73] and <=20/200 [24-34]) as fixed factors. The LOCF approach has 
been applied to impute missing data with baseline values not being carried forward.  
Multiplicity: A hierarchical inferential approach has been used in order to control the overall type-1 
error for multiple key efficacy endpoints. Statistical significance of the primary efficacy endpoint at the 
5% level was required before testing the first of secondary efficacy endpoints in the following order:  
Change from baseline at Week 24 in 1) BCVA score; 2) CRT; 3) NEI VFQ-25 total score. A hypothesis 
was only tested for the successive secondary endpoint if all the previous endpoints were statistically 
significant. 
All additional efficacy variables were analysed descriptively at Week 24 and Week 52. No multiple 
comparison adjustment was done for additional efficacy analyses 
Efficacy subgroups included sex, age, race, ethnicity, smoking history, and anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
response.

Results 
Recruitment 
The VIBRANT study was conducted in approximately 63 study sites in North America (United States, 
Canada) and Japan. A total of 281 subjects were screened in the study, 183 of whom were randomised 
and treated as follows: 92 subjects in the laser group and 91 subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group. 
Conduct of the study 
The VIBRANT study was conducted from 10 April 2012 (first subject’s first dose) to 28 August 2013 
(last subject’s last visit for the primary endpoint at week 24). The study continued to Week 52 with the 
last subject’s last visit on 10 March 2014. 
There were 2 amendments to the study protocol on 4 June 2012 and 29 March 2013 respectively. The 
amendments included an update to simplify and harmonise the laser photocoagulation procedure. 
Other updates concerned the rescue treatment as well as the exclusion criteria and the IVT 
administration procedure (including sham). 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics are summarised in Table 3 and Table 4. 
At baseline, 4 subjects had HRVO: 3 subjects in the laser group and 1 subject in the active arm. 
Amongst the patients with ocular disease history, the most common eye disorders were RVO (100% of 
subjects) and macular oedema (70.7% and 74.7% in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and the VEGF Trap-
Eye groups, respectively). About half of the subjects had cataract (45.7% and 52.7% in the laser + 
VEGF Trap-Eye and the VEGF Trap-Eye groups, respectively), with previous cataract surgery having 
occurred in 16.3% and 8.8% of subjects in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and the VEGF Trap-Eye groups, 
respectively.  
For non-ocular history, 80.4% and 72.5% of subjects had hypertension in the laser and the VEGF Trap-
Eye groups, respectively, 19.6% and 30.8% had hypercholesterolemia, and approximately 28.2% and 
16.5% had either type 2 diabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus in the laser and the VEGF Trap-Eye 
groups, respectively. 
The most commonly used concomitant medications (many of these being required as part of 
examination procedures) were ophthalmologicals (92 [100%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye, 91 [100%] VEGF 
Trap-Eye) followed by cardiovascular system medicines (87 [94.6%] laser, 84 [92.3%] VEGF Trap-
Eye), antiseptics and disinfectants (83 [90.2%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye, 81 [89.0%] VEGF Trap-Eye), 
antibacterials for systemic use (73 [79.3%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye, 78 [85.7%] VEGF Trap-Eye), 
agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (53 [57.6%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye, 45 [49.5%] VEGF 
Trap-Eye) and serum lipid reducing agents (43 [46.7%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye, 51 [56.0%] VEGF 
Trap-Eye).

Numbers analysed 
Of the 92 subjects randomised in the laser group, two patients were excluded from the FAS as they 
had no post-baseline BCVA assessment and 7 patients were excluded from the PPS at Week 24 
(primary analysis). All of the 91 subjects randomised in the VEGF Trap-Eye group were included in the 
FAS and all but 1 subject were included in the PPS at Week 24. 
Table 5 - Study Analysis Sets (All Randomized Subjects) 
By Week 52, a total of 173 (94.5%) subjects participating in this study had 1 or more protocol 
deviations, most of which were minor in nature. By Week 24 total of 6 (3.3%) subjects had major 
protocol deviations, of which the most common was “inadequate informed consent administration” (3 
[1.6%] subjects).  By Week 52, a total of 12 (6.6%) subjects had major protocol deviations, of which 
the most common was “visit not performed” (8 [4.4%] subjects). 
The majority of subjects in each treatment group (90.2% laser and 93.4% VEGF Trap-Eye) completed 
the first 24 weeks of the study. A total of 15 (8.2%) subjects discontinued the study prior to Week 24 
(9 [9.8%] subjects in the laser group and 6 [6.6%] subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group). The primary 
reason for premature discontinuation from the study in the laser group was “withdrawal by subject” 
(n=6; 6.5%). The primary reasons in the VEGF Trap-Eye group were “adverse event” and “withdrawal 
by subject” (n=3; 3.3%, each reason). 
The majority of subjects in each treatment group (83.7% laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 80.2% VEGF 
Trap-Eye) completed the 52 weeks of the study. A total of 33 (18.0%) subjects discontinued the study 
prior to Week 52 (15 [16.3%] subjects in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group and 18 [19.8%] subjects in 
the VEGF Trap-Eye group). The primary reason for premature discontinuation from the study in both 
groups was withdrawal by subject”(9 [9.8%] subjects in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group and 11 
[12.1%] subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Results are presented for both the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 as well as for the additional 
analysis at Week 52.  
Patients randomised to the laser arm were referred to as laser group (Week 24) or laser + VEGF Trap-
Eye group (Week 52, taking into account possible rescue treatment as of Week 24). Notably, within the 
initial laser group as randomised, 67 patients received VEGF Trap-Eye rescue treatment from Week 24.

Primary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of Subjects who Gained at Least 15 Letters in BCVA 
The primary analysis (Week 24, LOCF, FAS) demonstrated a statistically significant superiority of VEGF 
Trap-Eye to laser for the primary endpoint (see Table 6). The proportion of subjects who gained at 
least 15 letters in BCVA was 52.7% in the VEGF Trap-Eye group versus 26.7% in the laser group. The 
between-group difference was 26.1%, which was statistically significant (adjusted difference 26.6% 
[95% CI=13.0% to 40.1%, p=0.0003]). 
Table 6 – Proportion of Patients with ≥ 15 Letters in BCVA (LOCF, FAS) 
Results in the PPS yielded consistency with the analyses conducted in the FAS. Sensitivity analyses on 
the FAS by OC and multiple imputation analysis also demonstrated results similar to those in the FAS 
LOCF.  
The results of the subgroup analyses in the proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in 
BCVA at Week 24 from baseline were generally qualitatively consistent with those seen in the overall 
population.

At Week 52 in the FAS, the proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA was 57.1% 
(52/91) in the VEGF Trap-Eye group versus 41.1% (37/90)  in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group. The 
in-between groups difference was 16.0% (adjusted difference 16.2% [95% CI=2.0% to 30.5%, 
p=0.0296]). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The results for the secondary endpoints at Week 24 (primary analysis) are summarised in Table 7. 
Further detail is provided below including results through to Week 52. 
Table 7 - Secondary Efficacy Variables – Results from Baseline to Week 24 
•  Change from baseline in BCVA score. 
A rapid increase in BCVA was observed beginning at the first post-baseline measurement at Week 1 
and continuing through Week 24 (see Table 7 and Figure 3).  
This increase was maintained from Week 24 through Week 52 (see Figure 3). At Week 52, 
improvement from baseline for BCVA occurred in both dose groups; however, the magnitude of 
increase in the VEGF Trap group for mean change and least squares (LS) mean change in BCVA score 
(17.1 and 12.4 letters, respectively) exceeded that of the laser + VEGF Trap group (12.2 and 7.1 
letters, respectively).

Figure 3 – Mean Change From Baseline (SE) to Week 52 in BCVA Score (LOCF, FAS) 
Results of the subgroup analyses were consistent with those seen in the overall population and the 
results from the sensitivity analysis (OC, FAS) showed a trend similar to the LOCF, FAS results. 
•  Change from baseline in CRT, assessed by OCT. 
The VEGF Trap-Eye group demonstrated a rapid reduction in CRT beginning at the first post-baseline 
measurement at Week 1 and continuing through Week 24 (see Table 7 and Figure 4). This reduction 
was maintained from Week 24 through Week 52 (see Figure 4). At Week 52, reductions in CRT 
occurred in both dose groups; however, the magnitude of the decrease in the VEGF Trap-Eye group 
(mean change -83.9 μm, LS mean change -243.2 μm) exceeded that in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye 
group (mean change -249.3 μm, LS mean change -213.7 μm). The difference in CRT reduction 
between the VEGF Trap-Eye and laser + VEGF Trap-Eye groups by treatment, adjusted by region and 
baseline BCVA, was -29.5 (95% CI= -54.7 to -4.4, p=0.0218).

The FAS OC results were similar to the FAS LOCF results. Results of the subgroup analyses were 
consistent with those seen in the overall population. 
•  Change from baseline in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-
25) total score. 
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score was slightly higher in the 
VEGF Trap-Eye group (mean change 7.7 points, LS mean change 5.3 points) compared to the laser 
group (mean change 6.3 points, LS mean change 2.7 points). The difference, adjusted by region and 
baseline BCVA, was not statistically significant [2.6 (95% CI=-0.3 to 5.5, p=0.0833)]. These results 
were confirmed in the sensitivity analyses (OC, FAS) and consistent results were seen across 
subgroups.  
At Week 52, the mean change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score was slightly higher in the 
VEGF Trap-Eye group (mean change 9.4 points, LS mean change 5.3 points) compared to the laser + 
VEGF Trap-Eye group (mean change 8.3 points, LS mean change 2.9 points). The difference in the 
change from baseline in NEI VFQ-25 total score between the VEGF Trap-Eye and laser + VEGF Trap-
Eye groups by treatment, adjusted by region and baseline BCVA, was 2.5 (95% CI=-0.5 to 5.4, 
p=0.0986). 
Additional secondary endpoints 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a decrease in retinal ischemia, as assessed by the reduction in 
the area of non-perfused retina on fluorescence angiography. 
Decrease in Retinal Ischemia 
The reduction in retinal ischemia was measured for any given subject as an absolute reduction in the 
number of quadrants containing any amount of retinal capillary non-perfusion from baseline to 
Week 24 and 52.  
At Week 24, while greater proportion of subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group (29.0%) had a decrease 
in retinal ischemia from baseline compared to the laser group (17.6%), the adjusted difference 
between groups was not significantly different between groups (see Table 8). A total of 22 subjects 
could not be evaluated due to insufficient data. Sensitivity analysis (OC, FAS) demonstrated a 
significant difference between groups favouring VEGF Trap-Eye (nominal p-value=0.0291). 
Table 8 - Proportion of Subjects with a Decrease in Retinal Ischemia through Week 24 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 26/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At Week 52, the decrease in retinal ischemia from baseline was similar in the VEGF Trap-Eye group 
(25 [34.7%]) and the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group (21 [29.6%]). The percentage difference was 
5.1% between groups, with an adjusted difference of 5.7%. 
Capillary perfusion status 
Using a threshold of 10 disc areas (DA), patients were categorised as ‘non-perfused’, if the area of 
capillary non-perfusion was > 10 DA and as perfused in case capillary non-perfusion of ≤ 10 DA.  
The proportion of subjects with an evaluation status of ‘perfused’ increased from 60.4% at baseline to 
80.2% at Week 24 in the VEGF Trap-Eye group, compared to a small decrease from 68.9% to 67.1% 
in the laser group (see Table 9). The adjusted difference between groups was 13.7%, which was 
statistically significant. Similar results were observed in the sensitivity analysis.  Overall, 18 subjects 
were reported with ‘data missing’. 
Table 9 - Perfusion Status at Week 24 
At Week 52, the perfusion status was similar between similar in the VEGF Trap-Eye group 
(67 [77.9%]) and the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group (64 [78.0%]). The adjusted difference was 1.8% 
(95% CI=-10.2% to 13.8%; nominal p-value was 0.7742). 
Subgroup analysis by perfusion status 
As there were some imbalances between treatment groups in the perfusion status at baseline. And 
since a significant percentage of patients was not classified at all, subgroup analyses were performed 
for the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 24. Treatment effects in terms of adjusted differences 
between proportions of subjects in both groups who gained at least 15 letters at Week 24 were similar 
in the subgroups of ‘Perfused’ subjects (20.1%; 95% CI: 3.6 to 36.6), ‘Non-perfused’ subjects 
(18.2%; 95% CI: -13.1 to 49.4), and ‘Perfused or Non-perfused’ subjects (21.9%; 95% CI: 7.2 to 
36.6). These results were slightly lower as compared to the total population (26.6%; 95% CI: 13.0 to 
40.1) indicating a trend toward a greater treatment difference in the small group of subjects where the 
perfusion status was ‘Cannot grade/ missing’ at baseline. When combining this subgroup with the ‘Non-
Perfused’ subjects a further increase in the treatment effect was seen (32.4%; 95% CI: 9.4 to 55.4).  
•  Time to first gain of at least 15 letters from baseline 
At Week 24, in the laser group, the 25% quartile of the time to first gain of ≥15 letters was 120 days. 
For the VEGF Trap-Eye group, the 25% quartile was 28 days (see Figure 5). For both groups, the 75% 
quartiles were not evaluable. The log-rank test showed that the time to first gain of ≥ 15 letters from 
baseline through week 24 differed between the VEGF Trap-Eye group and the laser group (nominal p-

value < 0.0001). Visual inspection of the Kaplan-Meier plot revealed that the time to first gain of ≥ 15 
letters was consistently shorter in the VTE group than in the laser group. 
At Week 52, in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group, the median time to first gain of ≥15 letters from 
baseline in the FAS was 260 days, and the 25% quartile was 120 days; the 75% quartile was not 
evaluable due to the low number of events. For the VEGF Trap-Eye group, the median time to first gain 
of ≥15 letters from baseline in the FAS was 89 days, the 25% quartile was 28 days, and the 75% 
quartile was not evaluable. The time to first gain of ≥15 letters from baseline through Week 52 was 
significantly shorter in the VEGF Trap-Eye group compared to laser + VTE (nominal p-value = 0.0010).

•  Time to first confirmed gain of at least 15 letters from baseline  
Results at Week 24 were similar to results of the time to first gain of ≥15 letters through week 24. In 
the laser group, the 25% quartile of the time to first confirmed gain of ≥15 letters was 148 days and 
for the VEGF Trap-Eye group, the 25% quartile was 29 days. While the 75% quartile was not evaluable 
in the laser group, it was determined to be 155 days for the VEGF Trap-Eye arm. The log-rank test 
showed that there was a significant between-group (nominal p-value < 0.0001). Visual inspection of 
the Kaplan-Meier plot revealed that the time to first confirmed gain of ≥ 15 letters was consistently 
shorter in the VEGF Trap-Eye group than in the laser group. 
Results at Week 52 were similar to the results of the time to first gain of ≥15 letters through Week 52 
(see above). 
•  Retinal fluid status as assessed by OCT 
The presence of fluid in the retina was assessed by spectral domain-OCT across the entire centre 
subfield as well as in the foveal centre only (see Table 10 for an overview of the results). 
At Week 24, the percentage of subjects who had a retinal fluid status of “Dry” (absence of intraretinal 
fluid or subretinal fluid) was higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye group than in the laser group in both cases 
and the differences were statistically significant (see Table 10).

At Week 52, the percentage of subjects who had a retinal fluid status of “Dry” was higher in the VEGF 
Trap-Eye group (38.5%) than in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group (31.1%). With regards to 
intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid in the foveal center, the percentage of subjects who had a retinal 
fluid status of “Dry” at Week 52 was higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye group (94.5%) than in the laser + 
VEGF Trap-Eye group (84.4%).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy of Eylea in the treatment of macular oedema secondary to BRVO was investigated 
in a single randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, active-controlled phase III study, VIBRANT, 
aiming at demonstrating superiority of Eylea over grid laser photocoagulation over a period of 
6 months (primary efficacy analysis) with an additional 6 months follow-up. Furthermore, reference 
was made to data from the phase III trials COPERNICUS and GALILEO showing superiority of Eylea 
over Sham in patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to CRVO. 
According to the MAH, laser had been the standard of care for BRVO treatment at the time when the 
VIBRANT study commenced. In principle, use of laser was considered acceptable, however, the CHMP 
noted that other treatments including ranibizumab, had already been authorised in some countries at 
the time of study inception. Furthermore, as shown in research conducted by the Branch Vein 
Occlusion Study (BVOS) Group, patients treated with laser may experience continuous improvement of 
vision over several years, with 65% of the patients gaining two or more lines on a vision chart by 
year 3 after first laser treatment. Therefore, the duration of the VIBRANT study might have been too 
short for the treatment effect of laser to fully unfold, while other treatments such as ranibizumab, 
which have shown early efficacy in reducing macular oedema would have been more suitable as active 
comparator. Furthermore, a comparison with ranibizumab would have been useful for clinical practice 
to inform about the relative benefit of Eylea.  
It was also noted that use of laser at the time of diagnosis of macular oedema was not in line with 
clinical guidelines in BRVO, which recommend deferring treatment for three months as the oedema 
might resolve spontaneously. However, the CHMP acknowledged that in fact a delay in laser treatment 
was no longer generally accepted by clinical specialist in light of scientific data suggesting that earlier 
interventions may result in greater visual improvements (Haller 2010 and 2011).  
All efficacy variables were usual and appropriate for the purpose of the study.  
A total of 181 patients were treated (91 with Eylea) and evaluable for efficacy in VIBRANT, which was 
considered by the CHMP rather a limited study size compared to previous studies conducted in CRVO  
patients, which involved a total of 358 subjects, even though BRVO is the more common type of RVO. 
The CHMP noted that few patients were excluded from the FAS due to lack of post-baseline 
measurements. This was only considered acceptable as the number of patients concerned was small 
and equally balanced across treatments and hence no major impact on the outcome was expected. 
The population studied represented treatment-naïve patients with BRVO or HRVO with a mean age of 
65 years and BCVA letter score of 58 letters representing moderate vision loss. No paediatric patients 
were recruited, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP as BRVO only very rarely occurs in this 
population and since approval is only sought in the adult population. Some differences were noted 
between the two study arms regarding age and sex as well as medical conditions including 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia or diabetes and previous cataract surgery. However, generally, 
demographic characteristics were balanced across treatment groups and in line with what may be 
expected for the broader population of RVO sufferers.

Central retinal thickness (CRT) was not part of the inclusion criteria, but CRT was elevated at baseline 
with the mean CRT being > 550μm. Diagnosis of macular oedema was based on clinical criteria in line 
with treatment guidelines. The CHMP furthermore noted that subjects with macular haemorrhage that 
was bad enough to have interfered with administration of laser were excluded as were patients with 
vitreous haemorrhage, thus suggesting that a less severe patient population was recruited. The MAH 
reminded that a total of 43 patients in VIBRANT (23.8%) had an excessive area of capillary non-
perfusion, which may be qualified as severe in line with published data (SCORE study, Scott et al, 
2009). The CHMP was satisfied with this response. 
Overall, despite some deficiencies, the study design and conduct were considered acceptable by the 
CHMP and suitable to support the present application. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
• 
Efficacy 
Initially, the MAH only submitted 6 month (Week 24) data from VIBRANT, as relevant for the primary 
efficacy analysis. Upon request by the CHMP, the MAH also provided results at Year 1. 
Results from VIBRANT demonstrated superiority of Eylea treatment over laser with regards to the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Week 24. The proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in 
BCVA was 52.7% (48/91) in the VEGF Trap-Eye group versus 26.7% (24/90) in the laser group. The 
difference between treatments was 26.1%, which was statistically significant and clinically relevant. 
Results were comparable throughout the sensitivity analyses and across subgroups of patients, 
although the analysis of some subgroups was affected by small numbers of patients.  
Superiority of Eylea compared to laser was also seen in the majority of secondary endpoints. By 
Week 24, patients receiving monthly Eylea injections gained on average 10.5 letter more in BCVA 
compared to the laser group. Macular oedema improved in both groups, but the mean reduction in CRT 
was more pronounced in the Eylea arm (248μm) compared to laser (99μm). The changes were 
statistically significant. Improvements in both VA and CRT in the Eylea group were achieved rapidly 
from Month 1 forward. Most of the effect was achieved after 3 months. In contrast, patients receiving 
laser treatment  improved at a consistent rate from Baseline onwards. The time course of the 
treatment effects was confirmed in the analyses of time to first (confirmed) gain of 15 letters in BCVA. 
Vision function as measured by the NEI VFQ-25 total score improved slightly more in Eylea treated 
patients (5 points, LS mean change) compared to laser (3 points, LS mean change). While the 
between-treatment difference was not statistically significant, a significant benefit of Eylea over laser 
was observed when measuring the near and distance activity subscales only. Numeric improvements 
were also seen for the visual dependency subscale. Similar results were obtained when using the 
EQ-5D Questionnaire which did not show significant improvements either. Therefore, the gain in VA 
was not totally translated in patient perceived improvements regarding the ability to run daily 
activities, but a trend could be observed.  
Additional variables investigated by the MAH included retinal ischemia and retinal perfusion. An 
improvement of both variables was seen in patients receiving Eylea compared to laser, though the 
relevance of this finding was considered limited as the definition of retinal ischemia as number of 
quadrants with any retinal capillary non-perfusion did not provide for a very precise measurement. 
Moreover, there were some imbalance in perfusion status between groups at baseline, a significant 
percentage of patients was not classified in any status ‘perfused or non-perfused’ at baseline and the 
percentage of unclassified patients was increasing with time. Additional subgroup analyses on the 
primary efficacy endpoint provided by the MAH addressed this concern by showing that the treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 33/67 
 
 
 
 
 
effect was similar in the subgroups of ‘perfused’ subjects, ‘non-perfused’ subjects and ‘perfused or 
non-perfused’ subjects (the differences in responders between Eylea and laser arm were 20.1%, 
18.2%, and 21.9%, respectively) and only slightly lower when compared to the total population 
(26.6%). The increased treatment effect in the total population was driven by the small group of 
patients who could not be graded or for whom grading was missing at baseline. No evident reason for 
this observations could be identified.  
Finally, the effect of Eylea on macular oedema was also measured in a responder analysis determining 
the retinal fluid status of patients. Compared to laser, significantly more patients receiving Eylea were 
classified as ‘dry’ across the entire centre subfield as well as for the foveal centre only. 
With regards to long-term efficacy, study data beyond 24 weeks showed that bi-monthly injections of 
Eylea are sufficient to maintain the initial benefits achieved with monthly injections. The change from 
baseline in BCVA in the Eylea group were 17 letters at both Week 24 and Week 52 and the proportion 
of patients gaining more than ≥ 15 letters increased only marginally between Week 24 and Week 52 
from 53% to 57%. In contrast to the Eylea treatment arm, patients in the laser arm experienced rapid 
and clinically relevant additional improvements from Week 24 to Week 52, which is reflected by an 
additional gain in BCVA of 5.3 letters and by an increase of proportion of patients gaining more than 
15 letters from 26.7% to 41.1%. A similar trend was observed for CRT reduction. This rapid 
improvement in the laser arm was considered to be due to the fact that, after Week 24, 67/91 patients 
received rescue treatment with Eylea according to pre-defined criteria.  
• 
Posology 
No dose finding study was conducted in the BRVO indication. The selection of the posology applied in 
VIBRANT was based on the results of the pivotal CRVO studies, where 6 initial monthly doses of 2mg 
VEGF Trap-Eye had been shown to be effective. Furthermore, based on the experience gained in other 
clinical trials conducted with Eylea to date, bi-monthly injections for the last 6 study months were 
selected. However, the CHMP noted that for the CRVO indication, too, the MAH had not studied a 
suitable dosing scheme and rather referred to the scheme investigated in the AMD pivotal trials. For 
CRVO, the Eylea product information recommends to revisit the need for continued treatment once 
vision has stabilised. Compared to CRVO, in BRVO, the area of retinal damage is generally smaller and 
macular oedema, if present, is likely to be less severe, which is reflected in the higher rate of 
spontaneous resolution. Therefore, a more stringent, fixed regimen in BRVO compared to CRVO was 
not considered justified and in light of the close relation of the two indications, the CHMP was of the 
view that the dosing recommendations should be aligned and their presentation combined in the label.  
The result in VIBRANT furthermore showed that the majority of the treatment effects of Eylea were 
achieved early in the study around Week 12, thus supporting an initial short-term fixed regimen of 
monthly injections. However, thereafter, additional gains in vision and CRT reduction were limited and, 
in the second part of the study, bi-monthly injections with Eylea resulted in a plateau with 
maintenance of the previously achieved visual and anatomical benefit, but no relevant further 
improvement. For these reasons, the CHMP was not convinced that a long-term fixed monthly/bi-
monthly treatment regimen was indeed required. Rather, the fixed dosing regimen might have been 
excessive, while a flexible regime might have resulted in similar efficacy with decreased exposure.  
Taken together, the CHMP considered the dose selection in VIBRANT questionable and the study not 
adequately designed to identify the most appropriate regimen for BRVO treatment. Therefore, based 
on the available scientific data for the class of anti-VEGF inhibitors, the CHMP recommended 
harmonisation of the posology with other products of the same class and thus a flexible regimen. Such 
regimen may include a treat and extend regimen, however there were insufficient data to conclude on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 34/67 
 
 
 
 
 
the length of these intervals. Harmonisation of the posology recommendation also included advice on 
monitoring for disease activity, which may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The VIBRANT study demonstrated efficacy of Eylea in the treatment of adult patients with macular 
oedema secondary to BRVO. A beneficial effect was achieved rapidly starting as of month 1, whereby 
most of the effect was achieved by month 3. One year data confirmed maintenance of the treatment 
effect in the longer term. However, the CHMP considered that the dosing regimen selected for the 
pivotal trial was not adequately justified and probably excessive. Thus, the final posology 
recommended for BRVO was more flexible compared to the one studied, but nevertheless was 
considered by the CHMP to be more appropriate in light of the time course of treatment effects 
observed in the VIBRANT study but also taking into account the current knowledge and clinical practice 
for the class of anti-VEGF inhibitors.  
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the available clinical efficacy data supported the approval of use of 
Eylea in adult patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to BRVO. Due to the 
proximity of the CRVO and BRVO indications, the CHMP furthermore considered that both indications 
should be aligned and combined in the label. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Clinical safety of Eylea for the treatment of BRVO was primarily supported by 12-months data from the 
pivotal phase III study VIBRANT (see section 2.4.2. for details on the methods). Data are presented 
for both Week 52 and Week 24, at which time patients in the laser group had not yet received any 
VEGF Trap-Eye rescue treatment, thus allowing for a comparison between treatment groups. 
Additional data was provided by the applicant from the large clinical safety database generated in 
support of the already approved indications AMD, CRVO and DME as well as from post-marketing 
experience. 
For data on immunogenicity, see section 2.3.3.  
Patient exposure 
The safety analysis was performed on the SAF (see number treated and Table 5 in section 2.4.2. of 
this report). A total of 183 subjects (92 in the laser group and 91 in the VEGF Trap-Eye group) were 
randomised and treated in the VIBRANT study. Similar proportions of subjects (90.2% in the laser 
group and 93.4% in the VEGF Trap-Eye group) completed the first 24 weeks of the study (20 weeks of 
treatment). The majority of subjects in each treatment group (83.7% laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 
80.2% VEGF Trap-Eye) completed the 52 weeks of the study. 
The total population ranged in age from 42 to 94 years, with a mean of 65.4 years. 
The planned exposure to VEGF Trap-Eye in the study eye was 2 mg administered monthly (2Q4, 
6 injections, 12 mg) followed by bi-monthly injections from Week 24 to Week 52 (2Q8, 4 injections, 
8 mg). At Week 24, the actual exposure was a mean of 5.7 injections (SD 0.75), with a median of 
6 injections and a range from 2 to 6 injections. Nearly all subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 35/67 
 
 
 
 
 
received 4-6 injections during the first 6 months of the study (88/91 [96.7%]), while 3 out of the 91 
subjects (3.3%) received 1-3 injections. 
By Week 52, a total of 91 subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group received a mean of 9.0 active 
injections. In the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group, a total 92 subjects received a total of 743 sham 
injections and a total of 67 subjects received rescue treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye (3 monthly 
injections 2Q4, followed by injections every 8 weeks 2Q8) with a mean of 4.4 active injections between 
week 24 and week 52.  
A total of 92 subjects in the laser group received a total of 508 sham injections until Week 24 and no 
active injections over the same duration of treatment. In the laser group, the majority (61 [66.3%]) of 
subjects received 2 active laser treatments. By the end of the study, subjects in the laser + VEGF 
Trap-Eye group received a mean of 1.7 active laser treatments in the study eye.  
Subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group received a total of 115 sham laser treatments, but no active laser 
treatments up to Week 24. Nine subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group received a mean of 1.0 active 
laser treatments in the study eye as rescue at Week 36. 
By Week 24, the mean duration of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment was 164.8 days (SD 19.5) with a median 
of 168 days and a range from 57 to 182 days. The mean duration of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment at the 
end of the study was 171.7 days (SD 43.69) in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group and 333.7 days (SD 
74.61) in the VEGF Trap-Eye group with a median of 192 days in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group and 
a 364.0 days in the VEGF Trap-Eye group. 
There was no IVT treatment of the fellow eye in the study until Week 24.  Between Week 24 and 
Week 52, two subjects (one diagnosed with BRVO with DME and the other with peripapillary choroidal 
neovascularization) received intravitreal treatment of the fellow eye with ranibizumab (Lucentis). 
Adverse events  
Approximately two-thirds of all subjects in each treatment group (62.0% laser and 63.7% VEGF Trap-
Eye) experienced at least one adverse event (AE) through Week 24. Treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) occurred in 58.7% of the laser group subjects and 63.7% of the VEGF Trap-Eye group 
subjects. A total of 3 subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group withdrew from study drug due to an AE. 
By Week 52 more than 80% of all subjects in each treatment group (84.8% laser + VTE and 83.5% 
VTE) experienced at least one AE. TEAEs occurred in 81.5% of the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group 
subjects and 83.5% of the VEGF Trap-Eye group subjects (at Week 24: 58.7% of the laser group 
subjects and 63.7% of the VEGF Trap-Eye group had TEAEs). 
•  Ocular adverse events 
By Week 24, the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 ocular TEAE in the study eye was higher in 
the VEGF Trap-Eye group (34 subjects [37.4%]) compared to the laser group (25 subjects [27.2%]). 
The difference in frequency was largely due to a higher frequency in the VEGF Trap-Eye group of ocular 
TEAEs consistent with the IVT method of administration. TEAEs considered by the investigator to be 
related to the injection procedure occurred with a higher frequency in the VEGF Trap-Eye group 
(25.3%) than in the laser group (8.7%), including cataract traumatic, blindness and vitreous 
haemorrhage. An overview of the TEAEs reported by Week 24 is provided in Table 12. 
At Week 52, the incidence of ocular TEAEs in the study eye was 49.5% (45 subjects) in the VEGF Trap-
Eye group compared to 47.8% (44 subjects) in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group.

The most common ocular TEAEs (≥5%) in the study eye were Conjunctival Haemorrhage (4.3% laser 
and 19.8% VEGF Trap-Eye through Week 24, 15.2% laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 24.2% VEGF Trap-Eye  
through Week 52) and Eye Pain (5.4% laser and 4.4% VEGF Trap-Eye through Week 24, 7.6% laser + 
VEGF Trap-Eye and 5.5% VEGF Trap-Eye through Week 52) and Eye Irritation (1.1% laser + VEGF 
Trap-Eye and 7.7% VEGF Trap-Eye through Week 52). Other individual ocular TEAEs in the study eye 
were low and mostly balanced between treatment groups.

There was 1 instance of an ocular TEAE consistent with Intraocular Inflammation in the laser + VEGF 
Trap-Eye group (Vitreal Cells, 1 subject [1.1%]) between Week 24 and Week 52. 
The incidence of any drug-related ocular TEAEs was low in both treatment groups [1.1% (2 subjects) 
each in laser and VEGF Trap-Eye by Week 24, 2.2% (4 subjects) each in laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 
VEGF Trap-Eye by Week 52]. One of the two patients in the VEGF Trap Eye group reported a case of 
intraocular pressure (IOP) increased and the other retinal vascular disorder. The cases reported in the 
laser + VEGF Trap Eye  concerned eye discharge (2), eye irritation (1), eye pain (1) and ocular 
hyperaemia (2). 
Most ocular TEAEs in the study eye were of mild or moderate intensity. Ocular TEAEs in the study eye 
were generally consistent either with disease progression (particularly in the laser group in the first 
24 weeks before subjects could become eligible for VTE rescue treatment), or with the injection 
procedure (particularly in the VEGF Trap-Eye group).  
The incidence of ocular TEAEs in the fellow eye was low: 7.6% and 19.6% in the laser + VEGF Trap-
Eye group and 11.0% and 25.3% in the VEGF Trap-Eye group at week 24 and Week 52, respectively.  
•  Non-Ocular adverse events  
The percent of subjects experiencing at least 1 non-ocular TEAE was similar between treatment groups 
(46 [50.0%] laser and 43 [47.3%] VEGF Trap-Eye). The majority of non-ocular TEAEs were reported 
to be mild in intensity (29 [31.5%] laser, and 23 [25.3%] VEGF Trap-Eye). Between 14% and 19% of 
TEAEs were reported to be moderate in intensity (13 [14.1%] laser, and 17 [18.7%] VEGF Trap-Eye), 
and between 3% and 5% were considered to be severe in intensity (4 [4.3%] laser, and 3 [3.3%] 
VEGF Trap-Eye). None of the non-ocular TEAEs with a maximum intensity of severe occurred in more 
than 1 subject in either treatment group through Week 24. 
By week 52, the percent of subjects experiencing at least 1 non-ocular TEAE was still similar between 
treatment groups (63 [68.5%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 61 [67.0%] VEGF Trap-Eye). 
In general, there were comparable numbers of reports between treatment groups for individual 
MedDRA PTs. The most commonly reported non-ocular TEAEs were Hypertension (10 [10.9%] laser 
and 6 [6.6%] VEGF Trap-Eye by Week 24; 15 [16.3%] laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 10 [11.0%] VEGF 
Trap-Eye by Week 52), and Nasopharyngitis (5 [5.4%] laser and 6 [6.6%]by Week 24; 8 [8.7%] laser 
+ VEGF Trap-Eye and 8 [8.8%] VEGF Trap-Eye by Week 52).  
An overview of non-ocular TEAEs by Week 24 is provided in Table 13.

through Week 24 by Primary SOC and PT (SAF) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidence of SAEs was similar in both groups (9.8% laser and 9.9% VEGF Trap-Eye at Week 24; 
10.9% laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 15.4% VEGF Trap-Eye by Week 52), and no drug- or laser 
procedure-related related SAEs were reported.  
Death 
No death occurred in the VEGF Trap-Eye treatment group.  One subject in the laser group died 35 days 
after the last treatment (sham injection) as a result of pneumonia during the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 40/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Serious ocular adverse events 
One subject in the VEGF Trap-Eye group experienced an ocular SAE in the study eye of Cataract 
Traumatic. A few days after cataract occurrence, the patient underwent surgery without complication 
and according to the operative report, the traumatic cataract might be related to a posterior capsular 
rupture from the intravitreal injection. The SAE was resulted in the subject discontinuing study drug. 
There were no other ocular SAEs in the study eye in either treatment group through week 52. No cases 
of endophthalmitis was reported. 
•  Serious non-ocular adverse events 
The overall incidence of non-ocular SAEs was similar between the treatment groups (9 [9.8%] subjects 
in the laser group and 8 [8.8%] subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group at Week 24; 10 [10.9%] subjects 
in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye and 13 [14.3%] subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups through 
Week 52). With the exception of 2 subjects in the laser group who experienced dehydration and 
2subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group who experienced pneumonia, all other non-ocular SAEs occurred 
in only 1 subject in either dose group. 
There were no non-ocular drug-related SAEs reported in any subject in either treatment group through 
Week 52. 
•  Other significant events 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) 
ATEs are AEs potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition and there is a theoretical risk of ATEs 
following IVT use of VEGF inhibitors. ATEs, as defined by the APTC criteria (Antiplatelet Trialists’ 
Collaboration), include non-fatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death (including 
deaths of unknown cause). Potential Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs) were evaluated by a 
masked adjudication committee. 
A total of 2 (2.2%) subjects in the laser + VEGF Trap-Eye group experienced APTC events through 
Week 52: 1 subject experienced a cerebrovascular accident (non-fatal stroke) after receiving 4 sham 
injections, and 1 subject experienced a non-fatal myocardial infarction after receiving 7 sham 
injections and 3 VEGF Trap-Eye injections. 
Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
No trend towards an increase or decrease in mean values over time was seen in the chemistry 
parameters tested in either treatment group. The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had 
normal values at baseline and at subsequent visits regarding most chemistry parameters.  
Haematology 
Generally most of the haematological parameters showed no notable changes from baseline for the 
study population as a whole or by treatment group. In addition, no notable imbalances between the 
treatment groups were observed. 
Urinalysis 
No trends towards an increase or decrease in mean values over time were seen in the urinalysis 
parameters tested in either of the treatment groups . There were few overall shifts from baseline in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 41/67 
 
 
 
 
 
urinalysis parameters, and there was no evidence of a meaningful difference between treatment 
groups. 
Vital signs 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature were similar between the 
laser and VEGF Trap-Eye groups at baseline, and varied slightly relative to the baseline values in all 
treatment groups throughout the study, with no obvious trends over time relative to treatment or 
dose. 
Safety in special populations 
Sub-group analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of demographic and disease variables on 
safety including ≥75 years of age, ethnicity [Hispanic or Latino], smoking history [current], 
hypertension [no], race [Asian], cerebrovascular disease [yes], ischemic heart disease [yes], and renal 
impairment [moderate and severe], medical history of renal impairment [moderate and severe], 
hepatic impairment [yes], and anti-VEGF Trap antibody response (positive).  
Overall, the results of the subgroup analyses of ocular TEAEs as well as of non-ocular TEAEs and SAEs 
were similar to those seen in the entire study population. The only exception to this was seen in the 
≥65 to <75 years of age subgroup. For this subgroup, the overall frequency of non-ocular SAEs was 
higher in the laser group (4 [14.8%] subjects) than in the VEGF Trap-Eye group (1 [3.1%] subjects) at 
Week 24. The difference was still present at Week 52. However, the sample of this subgroup (n=27 
laser and n=32 VEGF Trap-Eye) was rather small. No meaningful comparison could be made for ocular 
SAEs as there was only 1 reported. 
Pregnancy, Lactation and Fertility 
No information was available from VIBRANT regarding the safety of VEGF Trap-Eye in breast-feeding 
women, or in pregnant women and their foetuses. No pregnancies were reported during the 52 weeks 
of the VIBRANT study and no information was available regarding the safety in breast-feeding women. 
Many of the female subjects were in menopause. 
Overdose 
No overdoses (including no AEs with the PT overdose) were reported during the VIBRANT study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with VEGF Trap-Eye. 
Concomitant topical medications (topical anaesthetic and antibiotic) given prior to and after the 
injection of VEGF Trap-Eye were not expected to interact with this medication. Subjects participating in 
the BRVO clinical development program of VEGF Trap-Eye received treatment for a variety of diseases 
common to this study population including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence rate of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 3.3% in the VEGF Trap-Eye 
group. There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the laser group. Of the 3 events in the VEGF 
Trap-Eye group, 2 were ocular and both occurred in the study eye (Cataract Traumatic and Intraocular 
Pressure [IOP] Increased). One (1.1%) subject in the VEGF Trap-Eye group discontinued study drug 
due to a non-ocular TEAE of Breast Cancer Metastatic. The patient had a medical history of breast 
Assessment report

cancer 6 years before study treatment initiation. The recurrence of cancer occurred 3 months after VTE 
introduction. One more subject was reported to have had two AEs (central pelvic abscess and small 
bowel obstruction) leading to discontinuation of the study. As a consequence of these AEs the subject 
went to a hospice for a prolonged period and never continued the study treatment. 
Post marketing experience 
VEGF Trap has been commercially available in the United States since November 2011 and in the EU 
since November 2012, as well as in a number of other countries as of 2012.  
A total of 2482 AEs have been reported within 1382 spontaneous case reports starting on the date of 
product availability in countries where Eylea has been commercially available through to 31 January 
2014. Based upon the most recent publicly available sales information (through 31 December 2013) 
the number of vials sold worldwide was estimated to be 1,709,923. Each vial sold is considered to 
represent a single drug administration. 
Of the 1382 spontaneous case reports, 1166 were medically confirmed reports by health care 
professionals and 216 were not medically confirmed. Out of 1166 medically confirmed case reports a 
total of 816 cases were serious. 
The MedDRA SOC with the greatest number of both serious and non-serious ADRs is the Eye Disorder 
system (1382 events, or approximately 55.7% of all AEs reported); followed by General Disorders and 
Administration Conditions (225 events, 9.1%), and Infections and Infestations (215 events, 8.7%). For 
serious AEs only, the Eye disorders system accounts for 58.8% of reported serious AEs followed by 
Infections and Infestations (15.1%) and Nervous System disorders (7.7%). 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety analysis was mainly based on one Phase III study VIBRANT, which included 
183 patients. Additional supportive data were available from the clinical safety database in AMD, DME 
and CRVO as well as from post-marketing experience. Data from studies conducted in patients with 
AMD, DME and CRVO had previously been assessed and were therefore not discussed in this report. 
In VIBRANT, a total of 515 injections of Eylea were administered in the VEGF Trap-Eye arm with a 
mean number of 5.7 injections over the first 6 months of the study. By week 52, a total of 
820 injections of Eylea had been administered with a mean of 9 injections. Overall, 150 patients (82%) 
completed Week 52 including 77 (83.7%) in the laser group and 73 (80.2%) in the Eylea group.  
Notably, after Week 24, 67 patients in the laser group received rescue treatment with Eylea with a 
mean of 4.4 injections). In general, the size of the BRVO safety database was considered by the CHMP 
very limited and it did not allow to detect rare adverse events. The MAH confirmed that BRVO patients 
will be included in the post-authorisation safety study LIBRA which aims at a long term investigation 
and benefit-risk analysis of the real-life utilisation of aflibercept in macular disease. The risk 
management plan (RMP) was updated accordingly and the CHMP agreed that additional study data be 
collected post-authorisation. 
Overall, the safety data from VIBRANT were broadly in line with the known safety profile of Eylea. The 
overall incidence of adverse events in general as well as of non-ocular adverse effects only was similar 
between treatments groups. As was to be expected, a difference in reporting rates was observed for 
ocular adverse events, which occurred more frequently in patients receiving intravitreal injections of 
Eylea. The difference was mainly due to injection related events, which were also the most common 
adverse events, i.e. conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain and irritation, foreign body sensation, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015

lacrimation increased. These reactions were known to occur with use of Eylea and were already 
described in the product information. No case of endophthalmitis occurred in VIBRANT. However, 
changes to section 4.4. of the SmPC were introduced upon request by the CHMP in order to harmonise 
the warnings on intravitreal injection related adverse events including endophthalmitis across all anti-
VEGF inhibitors as well as on concomitant use with other anti-VEGF inhibitors for which no data were 
available.  
One serious case of traumatic cataract occurred. Traumatic cataract was already listed as an important 
identified safety concern in the RMP and, following this assessment, was also included in the product 
information as a rare adverse reaction in SmPC section 4.8. The MAH also updated the list of serious 
adverse reactions related to the injection procedure in SmPC section 4.8 by adding cataract traumatic 
as well as blindness and vitreous haemorrhage, which had been reported as injection related.      
Concerning arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), no case was reported in the study drug arm. One 
case of non-fatal myocardial infarction was reported in a patient in the laser arm who received rescue 
treatment with Eylea. The information in SmPC section 4.8 was updated accordingly. ATEs remained a 
safety concern for Eyela and related events will need to continue to be monitored.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the safety data were adequate to support the application for use of 
Eylea in the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema caused by 
BRVO. Despite the limited size of the BRVO safety data, the findings from the VIBRANT study indicated 
that Eylea was generally well tolerated, both locally and systemically. The safety profile remained 
largely unchanged.  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC Advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC assessment report on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
A revised risk management plan (RMP), version 17.0, has been submitted within this application for 
the following extension of indication:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the risk minimisation 
measures in place were adequate. The assessment of effectiveness of the educational material for both 
patient and physician will be performed in a post-authorisation study which evaluates their knowledge 
of safety and safe use of Eylea and was considered sufficient. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes with the exception of some minor modifications in 
RMP version 17.2 as detailed above, for consistency. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
With this application, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
changes in section 4.4 were introduced in order to harmonise wording across the class of anti-VEGF 
inhibitors. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Additional changes were made 
throughout the product information in order to condense the information presented and consequently 
increase readability. Other minor editorial changes and corrections were made as well. 
The MAH furthermore took the opportunity to update the information under ‘obligation to conduct post-
authorisation measures’ in Annex II to clarify that the first condition refers to a study in patients with 
neovascular (wet) AMD and to update the due date to 31 December 2018. The revised due date had 
previously been agreed by the CHMP during a review of the study protocol. 
The main changes in SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 are shown below (additions highlighted in bold, 
deletions shown as strike-through). For all other changes, see attached product information.  
•  SmPC section 4.1 
Eylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of  
• 
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion 
(CRVObranch RVO or central RVO) (see section 5.1). 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1). 
•  SmPC section 4.2 
Macular Oedema secondary to CRVORVO (branch RVO or central RVO) 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.   
After the initial injection, treatment is given monthly. The interval between two doses should not be 
shorter than one month.   
If there is no improvement in visual and anatomic outcomes over the course of the first three 
injections, continued treatment is not recommended. If visual and anatomic  outcomes indicate 
that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, Eylea should be discontinued. 
Monthly treatment continues until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there are no signs 
of disease activityanatomic outcomes are stable for three monthly assessments. Thereafter the need 
for continued treatment should be reconsidered. Three or more consecutive, monthly injections 
may be needed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/98267/2015  
Page 59/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If necessary, tTreatment may then be continued with a treat and extend regimen with gradually 
increaseding treatment intervals to maintain a stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes, however 
there are insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If treatment has been 
discontinued, visual and/or anatomic outcomes should be monitored and treatment should be 
resumed if these deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. 
Usually, monitoring should be done at the injection visits. During treatment interval extension through 
to completion of therapy, Tthe monitoring and treatment schedule should be determined by the 
treating physician based on the individual patient’s response and may be more frequent than the 
schedule of injections. 
Monitoring for disease activity  may include clinical examination, functional testing or 
imaging techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
•  SmPC section 4.4 
EndophthalmitisIntravitreal injection-related reactions  
Intravitreal injections, including those with afliberceptEylea, have been associated with 
endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear 
and iatrogenic traumatic cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must 
always be used when administering Eylea. In addition, patients should be monitored during the 
week following the injection to permit early treatment  if an infection occurs. Patients should 
be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned 
events without delay.  
(…) 
Other 
As with other intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for AMD, CRVO, BRVO and DME the following also 
applies: 
• 
(…) 
•  Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
There is no data available on the concomitant use of Eylea with other anti-VEGF 
medicinal products (systemic or ocular). 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Eylea 40 mg/ml solution for injection in a vial (as 
submitted and endorsed with the previous extension of indication application for CRVO). The bridging 
report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The clinical efficacy of Eylea in the treatment of macular oedema secondary to BRVO was investigated 
in a single pivotal phase III study, VIBRANT, involving 181 patients treated with either laser 
(90 patients) or monthly injections of Eylea (91 patients). Patients in the laser group could receive 
Eylea rescue treatment after 6 months. The demographic characteristics of the patients recruited were 
generally balanced across treatment groups and in line with what may be expected for the broader 
population of BRVO sufferers.  
After 6 months of treatment, significantly more patients treated with Eylea compared to laser gained at 
least 15 letters in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) [52.7% (48/91) versus 26.7% (24/90)]. These 
results for the primary endpoint were confirmed in sensitivity analyses and across subgroups. Patients 
receiving monthly Eylea injections gained on average 10.5 letter more in BCVA compared to the laser 
group. The absolute improvement in vision, measured in mean gain of ETDRS letters of BCVA at 
6 months compared to baseline, was 17 letters in the Eylea arm. This improvement was considered 
clinically relevant as it represents a gain of 3 lines on a vision chart, which is a change perceptible to 
patients. In addition, macular oedema as measured by central retinal thickness (CRT) improved in both 
groups, but the mean reduction in CRT was more pronounced in the Eylea arm (248μm) compared to 
laser (99μm). The differences between treatments for all these variables were statistically significant. 
Improvements were also seen with regards to retinal ischemia and retinal perfusion. Furthermore, a 
responder analysis determining the retinal fluid status of patients at the end of the study, showed that, 
compared to laser, significantly more patients receiving Eylea were classified as ‘dry’ across the entire 
centre subfield as well as for the foveal centre only. 
Both functional and anatomic improvements were achieved rapidly starting at month 1 and continued 
to increase with most of the effect reached by month 3. In contrast, patients receiving laser treatment  
improved at a consistent slower rate from baseline onwards.  
Maintenance of the benefits achieved with Eylea in the longer-term was supported by 1 year data.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The CHMP noted some shortcoming in the study design of VIBRANT. Ideally, instead of laser as 
comparator, a comparison with ranibizumab would have been desirable as it would have provided 
useful information for clinical practice. However, the CHMP accepted that at the time of study initiation, 
laser was standard of care for BRVO. Furthermore, patients were not required to have a minimum CRT 
at baseline and thus confirmation of the presence of macular oedema was questioned. The CHMP was 
reassured on this point as mean CRT at baseline was reported as 556μm and a clinical diagnosis of 
macular oedema was performed prior to study entry.  
The CHMP further discussed if the recruited study population was fully representative of BRVO patients 
in clinical practice. Hardly any data were available to support efficacy of Eylea in patients suffering 
from BRVO for a duration of at least 3 months. However, there is now some evidence suggesting that 
interventions earlier than 3 months of diagnosis may result in greater visual improvements and thus 
the approach of the MAH was considered acceptable. In terms of disease severity, while some 
exclusion criteria suggested that the recruited population might be less severe than the general BRVO 
Assessment report

population, the fact that one quarter of the patients in VIBRANT had an excessive area of capillary 
non-perfusion, which suggests a severe disease grade, was reassuring. 
With regards to the study outcomes, while VIBRANT demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement of 
patients’ vision under treatment with Eylea, this gain in visual acuity did not seem to translate fully 
into patient perceived improvements regarding the ability to run daily activities as measured by the 
NEI VFQ-25 and EQ-5D Questionnaires. However, functional questionnaires are known to have a high 
variability and measure several factors contributing to the overall health state of patient, which might 
explain this finding.  
Furthermore, the relevance of the study results for retinal ischemia and retinal perfusion was 
considered limited as the definition of retinal ischemia as number of quadrants with any retinal 
capillary non-perfusion did not provide for a very precise measurement. Moreover, there were some 
imbalances in perfusion status between groups at baseline, a significant percentage of patients was not 
classified in any status ‘perfused’ or ‘non perfused’ at baseline and the percentage of unclassified 
patients was increasing throughout the study. Further subgroup analyses performed by the MAH 
showed that the treatment effect did not depend on the perfusion status, although findings in the 
subgroup of unclassified patients showed an increased benefit of Eylea in this group. While this finding 
could not be explained, it didn’t raise further concerns.  
Overall, the size of the clinical database (181 patients in the FAS including 91 patients receiving Eylea) 
was considered by the CHMP rather limited, but given the convincing efficacy results, the available 
data were considered sufficient to support this application.  
Importantly, the CHMP was of the opinion that the VIBRANT study was not adequately designed to 
identify the most appropriate dosing regimen for BRVO treatment. The fixed posology selected for 
VIBRANT, i.e. 6 initial monthly injections of 2mg aflibercept followed by bi-monthly injections, was not 
considered by the CHMP sufficiently justified and might be excessive. The time course of the visual and 
anatomical improvements showed that most of the treatment effects was achieved by month 3, thus 
supporting an initial short-term fixed regimen of monthly injections. A plateau was reached thereafter 
and while bi-monthly injections with Eylea resulted in maintenance of the treatment effect until the 
end of the study, no relevant further improvement was seen. A flexible regimen might have resulted in 
similar efficacy with decreased need for intravitreal injections. Such regimen is recommended for Eylea 
in the treatment of CRVO, which is a condition closely related to BRVO. It is also recommended for 
other anti-VEGF inhibitors for treatment of RVO. Overall, the CHMP considered that there was 
insufficient evidence to deviate from these recommendations and therefore agreed on a combined 
posology recommendation for both CRVO and BRVO based on a long-term flexible regimen, including 
treat-and-extend, in line with other anti-VEGF inhibitors. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety analysis was mainly based on data from 183 patients recruited in VIBRANT and receiving a 
total of 820 injections with Eylea over a duration of 1 year. 
Overall, the findings from the VIBRANT study supported a safety profile of Eylea broadly consistent 
with the known profile from previous clinical studies and post-marketing experience. Compared to 
laser, patients receiving Eylea experienced more ocular adverse reactions, of which the majority were 
related to the intravitreal route of administration, including conjunctival haemorrhage, eye 
irritation/pain, foreign body sensation, and lacrimation increased.

One serious case of traumatic cataract was reported, which was consequently reflected as a rare 
adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The list of serious adverse reactions due to the injection 
procedure was also updated by including cataract traumatic as well as blindness and vitreous 
haemorrhage, which had been reported as injection related in VIBRANT. 
The incidence of non-ocular adverse events was similar across treatment groups in VIBRANT. Two 
cases of arterial thromboembolic events were reported in the laser group including one case in a 
patient who had received Eylea rescue treatment. The information in SmPC section 4.8 was updated 
accordingly. While the data from VIBRANT did not raise a new safety issue, ATEs remained a safety 
concern for Eyela and related events will need to continue to be monitored. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The size of the BRVO safety database was limited (91 patients treated with Eylea) which precluded 
detection of rare adverse reactions. However, BRVO patients will be included in the post-authorisation 
study LIBRA which aims at a long term investigation and risk-benefit analysis of the real-life utilisation 
of aflibercept in macular disease, thereby creating additional data. 
Overall, the database was considered acceptable to support this application. 
Benefit-risk balance  
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
VIBRANT convincingly demonstrated a clinical benefit of Eylea in treating visual impairment in adult 
patients with macular oedema due to BRVO both in terms of functional and anatomical outcomes. More 
than half of the patients treated with Eylea for 6 months experienced a gain of 15 letters or more in 
BCVA, which is a clinically relevant improvement perceptible by patients. Furthermore, a significant 
reduction of retinal thickness was achieved with Eylea treatment, reflecting an improvement of the 
macular oedema. The onset of the beneficial effects was rapid, starting at month 1 of treatment 
initiation, which is in line with the goal of treatment to shorten duration of oedema, thereby reducing 
the risk for retinal damage and increasing the chances of vision recovery. The treatment effect was 
maintained over the full duration of the study of 1 year. 
Unfavourable effects observed were generally in line with the known safety profile of Eylea and mainly 
related to ocular adverse reactions linked to the intravitreal injection procedure. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the benefits of Eylea in the treatment of adult patients with visual 
impairment due to macular oedema secondary to BRVO outweighed the treatment related risks.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Several uncertainties arose from shortcomings in the study design including the choice of comparator, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as dose selection and study duration. While the treatment 
benefits were compelling enough to overcome these uncertainties, the CHMP considered that the study 
design was unsuitable to identify the optimal treatment frequency for BRVO patients. A fixed regimen 
as used in VIBRANT was considered by the CHMP to be likely excessive exposing the patient potentially 
unnecessarily to Eylea injections and related risks. A similar regimen as agreed for CRVO, i.e. initial 
fixed monthly dosing until stabilisation of vision to be followed by a flexible regimen, was considered

more appropriate in absence of suitable data. The posology recommendations were also aligned with 
what is recommended for other anti-VEGF inhibitors in the same indication. 
Due to the close relationship of the already approved CRVO indication and BRVO, the CHMP 
furthermore considered that the indications should be combined. 
Finally, the CHMP was of the opinion that additional safety data should be collected post-approval. To 
this end, BRVO patients will be recruited in the long-term post-authorisation study LIBRA, which was 
reflected in the RMP. 
4.  Recommendations 
The application for approval of Eylea indicated for adults for the treatment of visual impairment due to 
macular oedema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion is approvable since all concerns have been 
resolved. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following changes: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
II 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Extension of the indication for the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to macular 
oedema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO); Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated to add the new indication and related dosing recommendations, 
as well as in order to include information on the data supporting the application and resulting updates 
to the safety information. Section 4.4 was updated to harmonise the warnings for intravitreal injection-
related reactions and concomitant use with anti-VEGF inhibitors across the class of anti-VEGF 
inhibitors. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance. Furthermore, Annex II was updated to 
clarify the patient population (age related macular degeneration) for one of the studies and to update 
the due date as agreed during review of the study protocol. Additional amendments were made 
throughout the product information to condense the information as well as to make editorial changes. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet.

Summary 
Review of the data of the VIBRANT phase III study showed that Eylea was able to improve vision and 
reduce macular oedema in patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to BRVO. 
The safety profile remained largely unchanged and the benefit-risk balance was considered favourable.

Secondary 
a. To assess the immunogenicity following 2 doses (day 1 and day 31) of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine 
and control vaccines as measured by SBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against indicator strains 
H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 at baseline (day 1, prior to vaccination) and 1 month after the second 
dose (day 61); and the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of postvaccination to prevaccination (baseline) 
GMTs against the 3 indicator strains. 
b. To assess the immunogenicity following 2 doses (day 1 and day 31) of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine 
and control vaccines as measured by the percentage of subjects with a 4- fold rise in SBA titers 
against indicator strains H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 from baseline. 
c. To evaluate the immune response following 2 doses (day 1 and day 31) of rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccine and control vaccines as measured by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
geometric mean concentration (GMC); and the GMR of ELISA postvaccination to prevaccination 
(baseline) GMCs against vaccine antigen 287-953. 
Safety Objectives 
To assess the safety profile following the administration of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine and control 
vaccines in terms of percentages and numbers of subjects with: 
a. Local and systemic adverse events (AEs) reported from day 1 (day of vaccination) through day 7 
postvaccination. 
b. All other AEs reported from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination. 
c. Serious AEs (SAEs), medically attended AEs and AEs leading to premature withdrawal 
throughout the entire study. 
Study design 
This was a phase 3, observer-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled study in healthy subjects 
11 to 17 years of age in Korea. Two hundred and sixty four healthy subjects 11 to 17 years of age 
were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ (rMenB group; Group I in the 
protocol) OR 1 dose of saline placebo at day 1 followed by 1 dose of MenACWY-CRM at day 31 
(Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group; Group II in the protocol) 1. 
Study population  
Main inclusion criteria: 
1. 11-17 years of age inclusive who have given their written assent and whose parent or 
    legal guardian has given written informed consent at the time of enrollment. 
2. In good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical examination 
    and clinical judgment of the investigator; 
3. With a negative urine pregnancy test (for female subjects only). 
Main exclusion criteria: 
1.    History of any meningococcal vaccine administration; 
2.    Current or previous, confirmed or suspected disease caused by N meningitidis;

Treatments 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ (rMenB group; Group 
I in the protocol) OR 1 dose of saline placebo at day 1 followed by 1 dose of MenACWY-CRM at day 
31 (Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group; Group II in the protocol).  
All study vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM) only.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The measures of immunogenicity include the following: 
• 
The percentage of subjects with SBA titer ≥1:4 at baseline (day 1) and 1 month after 
the second vaccination (day 61) for each of the 3 indicator strains (H44/76, 5/99, and 
NZ98/254). 
•  SBA GMTs at baseline (day 1) and 1 month after the second vaccination (day 61) and 
GMRs of postvaccination to prevaccination (baseline) GMTs for each of the 3 
indicator strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254). 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in SBA titers from baseline (day 1) to 1 
month after the second vaccination (day 61) for each of the 3 indicator strains 
(H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254). 
ELISA GMCs at baseline (day 1) and at 1 month after the second vaccination (day 61) 
and GMRs for postvaccination to prevaccination (baseline) GMCs for vaccine antigen 
287-953. 
Safety Endpoints 
Local (ie, injection site pain, erythema, induration and swelling) and systemic (ie, loss of appetite, 
fever [axillary temperature ≥38.0°C], nausea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache) AEs were 
assessed for 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination. All AEs occurring 
during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination were collected on a 
diary card. 
Serious AEs, medically attended AEs and AEs that resulted in a subject’s withdrawal from the study 
were collected throughout the study period. 
Statistical Methods 
Both FAS and PPS were used for assessing the primary objective (so they refer to FAS-1 and PPS-
1). Analysis of secondary immunogenicity objectives were to be presented in the FAS population 
(refer to FAS-2), but because FAS and PPS differed by more than 10%, secondary immunogenicity 
analysis were also to be repeated in the PPS (PPS-2). 
For each meningococcal B strain for which SBA titer was measured, the percentage of subjects with 
a titer ≥1:4 was presented as point estimates along with the associated 95% Clopper-Pearson 
confidence intervals (CIs) at all the stipulated time-points, for both rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY-
CRM groups. 
The percentage of subjects with at least a 4-fold rise in SBA titer over the prevaccination titer and 
the associated 95% CIs were calculated for each of the 3 indicator strains and for each vaccine 
group.

For each indicator strain (H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254) and vaccine antigen 287-953, the GMT (for 
SBA titers against the 3 indicator strains) or GMC (for ELISA assay of vaccine antigen 287-953), 
and the postvaccination to prevaccination (baseline) GMRs and their associated 95% CIs, median, 
minimal and maximal values were determined using descriptive analyses and presented together 
with N (number of subjects). 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In total 264 subjects (176 subjects in the rMenB+OMV NZ group and 88 subjects in the 
Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group) were enrolled in this study. Of these, 262 subjects (174 
subjects from the rMenB+OMV NZ group and 88 subjects from the Placebo/MenACWYCRM 
group) completed the study  
Two subjects from the rMenB+OMV NZ group were prematurely withdrawn from the study.  
The reasons for early termination were: 
•  One subject (Subject ID: 03029) withdrew consent on study day 1, before being 
vaccinated. 
•  Another subject (Subject ID: 04002) withdrew consent on study day 32 due to an AE 
‘histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis’ (Kikuchi disease). Study vaccine was 
withdrawn and prescription drug therapy was started to treat the AE. Finally the 
subject recovered from the AE. In the opinion of the investigator the AE was not 
related to the study vaccine.

Baseline data 
Overall the demographic and other baseline characteristics for the enrolled population in the 
rMenB+OMV NZ group and Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group were well matched. Within each vaccine 
group the percentage of males were higher when compared to females (rMenB+OMV NZ group: 
56% vs. 44% respectively; Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group: 59% vs. 41% respectively).  
Of the total 264 subjects enrolled, 260 subjects (98%) met entry criteria. There were 4 
subjects  who actually did not satisfy entry criteria, developed withdrawal criteria but were not 
withdrawn from the study. 
Immunogenicity results 
Primary Objective 
Percentage of subjects achieving SBA titer ≥1:4 at one month after second vaccination (day 61) in 
FAS-1 dataset: 
At baseline (day 1), percentages of subjects with SBA titer ≥1:4 against 3 N meningitidis 
serogroup B indicator strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) were similar in the rMenB+OMV NZ 
and Placebo/MenACWY-CRM vaccine groups.

At 1 month after second vaccination, the percentages of subjects achieving an SBA titer ≥ 1:4 after 
2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine against 3 N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains were 
much higher compared to the Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group (Table 11.4.1-1).

b Prevaccination. 
Source: case study report v72_42, table 11.4.1-1. 
Primary immunogenicity analyses were repeated in the per protocol set (PPS-1) and the 
immunogenicity results were comparable to those observed in FAS-1 (source: case study report 
V72_42, table 11.4.1-2). 
CHMP comment: Robust functional antibody responses against bacterial strains specific for three of 
the antigenic components of the vaccine are demonstrated in the studied population of subjects 
aged 11-17 years in Korea. The SBA responses are in agreement with previously reported results.  
Secondary Objectives 
Percentage of subjects with 4-fold rise in SBA titers at one month after second vaccination (day 61) 
in FAS-2 dataset: 
At 1 month after second vaccination (day 61), a higher percentage of subjects achieved a 4- fold 
rise in SBA titers, in the rMenB+OMV NZ group, against 3 N meningitidis serogroup B indicator 
strains, compared to the Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group (Table 11.4.1-3).

CHMP comment: The difference in SBA response frequency 1 month after second vaccination 
between the groups is significant.     
GMT and GMRs at one month after second vaccination (day 61)in FAS- 2 dataset: 
At baseline (day 1), SBA GMTs against the 3 N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains (H44/76, 
5/99, and NZ98/254) were similar in the rMenB+OMV NZ and placebo/MenACWY-CRM vaccine 
groups. 
At one month after second vaccination (day 61), SBA GMTs against 3 N meningitidis serogroup B 
indicator strains in the rMenB+OMV NZ group were higher than in the placebo/MenACWY-CRM 
group (Table 11.4.1-4). 
Geometric mean ratios (GMRs; day61/day 1) against 3 N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains 
in the rMenB+OMV NZ group were also higher than in the placebo/MenACWY-CRM group  
(Table 11.4.1-4).

Source: case study report v72_42, table 11.4.1-4. 
CHMP comment: The GMTs after two doses of study vaccine are clearly higher than for the 
placebo/MenACWY-CRM treatment. The GMTs prevaccination are rather similar between treatment 
groups though, consequently resulting in higher GMRs in the rMenB group for all strains. The 
results are in agreement with previous reports.  
ELISA GMCs and GMRs against antigen 287-953 at one month after second vaccination (day 61) in 
FAS-2 dataset: 
At baseline (day 1), ELISA GMCs against antigen 287-953 were similar in the rMenB+OMV NZ and 
Placebo/MenACWY-CRM vaccine groups. 
At 1 month after second vaccination (day 61), ELISA GMCs for rMenB+OMV NZ group was higher 
than for the placebo/MenACWY-CRM group (Table 11.4.1-5). 
Geometric mean ratio (GMR; day 61/day 1) in the rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine group against antigen 
287-953 was also higher than in the Placebo/MenACWY-CRM group (Table 11.4.1-5).

supporting the previous results that the present vaccine has a good effect on immunogenicity. The 
data presented in the present study do not raise any concerns regarding the immunogenicity of 
vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ.

Two subjects from the rMenB+OMV NZ group reported SAEs. Subject ID: 04021 experienced right 
lower abdominal pain and was diagnosed with parovarian cyst and Subject ID: 05006 experienced 
abdominal pain and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis. In both subjects, SAEs were assessed as 
not related to the study vaccine. Both events were considered serious as the subjects were 
hospitalized (Table 12.2.1-3). 
One subject from the rMenB+OMV NZ group (Subject ID: 04002) was withdrawn from the study on 
study day 32 due to an AE ‘histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis’ (Kikuchi disease). Study vaccine 
was withdrawn and prescription drug therapy was started to treat the AE. Finally the subject 
recovered from the AE. In the opinion of the investigator the AE was not related to the study 
vaccine.

CHMP comment: The results from the present study is in agreement with previous reports. No new 
safety concerns are raised based on these results. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The submitted study was intended to assess the immunogenicity and safety following 2 doses of 
rMenB+OMV NZ and control in healthy adolescents aged 11 to 17 years in Korea. The aim of the 
study was to support licensure of the vaccine in Korea. The results generally confirm what is 
already known regarding immunogenicity and safety of Bexsero. Consequently, no further 
regulatory action considering Bexsero is required, based on the presented results.

4.  Member State Comments 
Comments were received from MS 1 who requested a further review of the AE of Kikuchi disease, 
as following: 
One subject withdrew consent on study day 32 due to the AE ‘histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis’ 
(Kikuchi disease). According to the CSR, this subject received the 1st dose of Bexsero but not the 
2nd dose because of the AE (observed 31 days post-vaccination). In the opinion of the investigator 
this AE was unrelated to study vaccine. Nevertheless, no rationale has been provided. 
Despite the 1 month-interval between vaccine dose and symptoms, the AE might at least be 
potentially related to vaccination since the etiology of Kikuchi disease (autoimmune? infectious?) is 
still unknown. 
The MAH is asked to provide the subject’s narrative and a rationale for exclusion of a potential 
relationship between Bexsero vaccination and Kikuchi disease.  
CHMP comment: The comments from MS 1 have been implemented in the RSI of the ongoing 
PSUSA assessment (EMEA/H/C/2333; PSUR 4) regarding Bexsero. 
Comments were received from MS 2 who endorsed the AR and had no additional comments.

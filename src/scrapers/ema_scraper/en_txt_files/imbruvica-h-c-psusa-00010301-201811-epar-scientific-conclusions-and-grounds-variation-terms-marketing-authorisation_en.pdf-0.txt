Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ibrutinib, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on a cumulative review of cases reported in clinical trials, in the post-marketing setting and taking 
into account a published report including 41 relevant cases as well as at least 6 more cases published in the 
scientific literature since then, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between ibrutinib and invasive 
fungal infections (IFI) cannot be excluded and therefore recommends the update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and section 2 and 4 of Package Leaflet with this adverse reaction.  
In addition, the frequency category of the adverse reaction hepatic failure should be updated from “not 
known” to “uncommon”. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibrutinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ibrutinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

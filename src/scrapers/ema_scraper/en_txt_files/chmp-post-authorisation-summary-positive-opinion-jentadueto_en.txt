Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Jentadueto 
linagliptin / metformin 
On 15 December 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Jentadueto. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Boehringer Ingelheim 
International GmbH. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication to extend the use of Jentadueto in combination with 
other diabetes medicines. The indication will read as follows: 
“Jentadueto is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control:  
• 
• 
• 
in patients inadequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone 
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, in patients 
inadequately controlled with metformin and these medicinal products 
in patients already being treated with the combination of linagliptin and metformin as separate tablets. 
(see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Colorectal cancer 
Lonsurf is indicated in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received two prior anticancer treatment regimens 
including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, 
and/or anti-EGFR agents. 
Lonsurf is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies 
including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, and 
anti-EGFR agents. 
Gastric cancer 
Lonsurf is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic gastric cancer 
including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have been previously treated with at 
least two prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease (see section 5.1).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Lonsurf should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the administration of anticancer therapy. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose of Lonsurf in adults, as monotherapy or in combination with 
bevacizumab, is 35 mg/m2/dose administered orally twice daily on Days 1 to 5 and Days 8 to 12 of 
each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 4.4). 
When Lonsurf is used in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic CRC, the dose 
of bevacizumab is 5 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks. Please refer to the full product 
information for bevacizumab. 
The dose is calculated according to body surface area (BSA) (see Table 1). The dose must not exceed 
80 mg/dose. 
If doses were missed or held, the patient must not make up for missed doses.

a At a total daily dose of 50 mg, patients should take 1 x 20 mg/8.19 mg tablet in the morning and 
2 x 15 mg/6.14 mg tablets in the evening. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
•  Mild renal impairment (CrCl 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 
59 mL/min) 
No adjustment of the starting dose is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
•  Severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min) 
For patients with severe renal impairment a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 twice daily is recommended 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). One dose reduction to a minimum dose of 15 mg/m2 twice daily is permitted 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
based on individual safety and tolerability (see Table 5). Dose escalation is not permitted after it has 
been reduced. 
In the event of haematological and/or non-haematological toxicities patients should follow the dose 
interruption, resumption and reduction criteria stated in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 5.

a At a total daily dose of 50 mg, patients should take 1 x 20 mg/8.19 mg tablet in the morning and 
2 x 15 mg/6.14 mg tablets in the evening. 
•  End stage renal disease (CrCl below 15 mL/min or requiring dialysis) 
Administration is not recommended in patients with end stage renal disease as there are no data 
available for these patients (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
•  Mild hepatic impairment 
No adjustment of the starting dose is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
•  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
Administration is not recommended in patients with baseline moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
(National Cancer Institute [NCI] Criteria Group C and D defined by total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN) as, a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinaemia is observed in patients with baseline moderate 
hepatic impairment, although this is based on very limited data (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Elderly  
No adjustment of the starting dose is required in patients ≥ 65 years old (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Efficacy and safety data in patients over 75 years old is limited. 
Paediatric population 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no relevant use of Lonsurf in the paediatric population for the indications of metastatic 
colorectal cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. 
Race  
No adjustment of the starting dose is required on the basis of patient’s race (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
There is limited data on Lonsurf in Black/African American patients but there is no biological 
rationale to expect any difference between this subgroup and the overall population.   
Method of administration  
Lonsurf is for oral use. The tablets must be taken with a glass of water within 1 hour after completion 
of the morning and evening meals. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Bone marrow suppression 
Lonsurf caused an increase in the incidence of myelosuppression including anaemia, neutropenia, 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. 
Complete blood cell counts must be obtained prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor 
toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle.  
Treatment must not be started if the absolute neutrophil count is < 1.5 109/L, if the platelet counts are 
< 75  109/L, or if the patient has an unresolved Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological clinically relevant 
toxicity from prior therapies.  
Serious infections have been reported following treatment with Lonsurf (see section 4.8). Given that 
the majority were reported in the context of bone marrow suppression, the patient’s condition should 
be monitored closely, and appropriate measures, such as antimicrobial agents and granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (G-CSF), should be administered as clinically indicated. In RECOURSE, TAGS and 
SUNLIGHT studies, 9.4%, 17.3% and 19.5% of patients in the Lonsurf group respectively received G-
CSF mainly for therapeutic use. In the SUNLIGHT study, 29.3% of patients in the Lonsurf with 
bevacizumab group received G-CSF including 16.3% for therapeutic use. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Lonsurf caused an increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicities including nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhoea. 
Patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal toxicities should be carefully 
monitored, and anti-emetic, anti-diarrhoeal and other measures, such as fluid/electrolyte replacement 
therapy, should be administered as clinically indicated. Dose modifications (delay and/or reduction) 
should be applied as necessary (see section 4.2).  
Renal impairment 
Lonsurf is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] < 15 mL/min or requiring dialysis), as Lonsurf has not been studied in these patients (see 
section 5.2). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The global incidence of adverse events (AEs) is similar in normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min), 
mild (CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl = 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment subgroups. 
However, the incidence of serious, severe AEs and AEs leading to dose modification tends to increase 
with advancing levels of renal impairment. In addition, a higher exposure of trifluridine and tipiracil 
hydrochloride was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment, compared with patients with 
normal renal function or patients with mild renal impairment (see section 5.2).  
Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl = 15 to 29 mL/min) and adjusted starting dose of 
20 mg/m2 twice daily had a safety profile consistent with the safety profile of Lonsurf in patients with 
normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Their exposure to trifluridine was similar to that of 
patients with normal renal function and their exposure to tipiracil hydrochloride was increased 
compared to patients with normal renal function, mild and moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Patients with renal impairment should be monitored closely when being treated with Lonsurf; patients 
with moderate or severe renal impairment should be more frequently monitored for haematological 
toxicities. 
Hepatic impairment 
Lonsurf is not recommended for use in patients with baseline moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
(National Cancer Institute [NCI] Criteria Group C and D defined by total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN), as a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinaemia is observed in patients with baseline moderate 
hepatic impairment, although this is based on very limited data (see section 5.2). 
Proteinuria 
Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting and during therapy 
(see section 4.8). 
Lactose intolerance 
Lonsurf contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and 5-[trifluoromethyl] uracil (FTY) 
did not inhibit the activity of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. In vitro evaluation indicated 
that trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and FTY had no inductive effect on human CYP isoforms (see 
section 5.2). 
In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine is a substrate for the nucleoside transporters CNT1, ENT1 
and ENT2. Therefore, caution is required when using medicinal products that interact with these 
transporters. Tipiracil hydrochloride was a substrate for OCT2 and MATE1, therefore, the 
concentration might be increased when Lonsurf is administered concomitantly with inhibitors of 
OCT2 or MATE1.  
Caution is required when using medicinal products that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., 
zidovudine. Such medicinal products, if used concomitantly with Lonsurf, may compete with the 
effector, trifluridine, for activation via thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral medicinal 
products that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the 
antiviral medicinal product, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral medicinal product that is 
not a human thymidine kinase substrate, such as lamivudine, didanosine and abacavir (see section 5.1). 
It is unknown whether Lonsurf may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, 
women using hormonal contraceptive must also use a barrier contraceptive method. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Based on findings in animals, trifluridine may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant 
women. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Lonsurf and for up to 6 months after 
ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive 
measures while taking Lonsurf and for 6 months after stopping treatment. It is currently unknown 
whether Lonsurf may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using 
hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier contraceptive method. 
Men with a partner of child-bearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and 
for up to 6 months after discontinuation of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no available data from the use of Lonsurf in pregnant women. Based on the mechanism of 
action, trifluridine is suspected to cause congenital malformations when administered during 
pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Lonsurf should not 
be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Lonsurf. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether Lonsurf or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have 
shown excretion of trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and/or their metabolites in milk (see 
section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment with Lonsurf. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on the effects of Lonsurf on human fertility. Results of animal studies did 
not indicate an effect of Lonsurf on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). Patients who wish to 
conceive a child should be advised to seek reproductive counselling and cryo-conservation of either 
the ovum or sperm prior to starting Lonsurf treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lonsurf has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness or malaise 
may occur during treatment (see section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most serious observed adverse reactions in patients receiving Lonsurf are bone marrow 
suppression and gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4). 
Lonsurf as monotherapy 
The safety profile of Lonsurf as monotherapy is based on the pooled data from 1114 patients with 
metastatic colorectal or gastric cancer in controlled phase III clinical studies. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) are neutropenia (53% [34% ≥ Grade 3]), nausea (31% 
[1% ≥ Grade 3]), fatigue (31% [4% ≥ Grade 3]), and anaemia (30% [11% ≥ Grade 3]).The most 
common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) that resulted in treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, dose 
delay, or dose interruption were neutropenia, anaemia, fatigue, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
diarrhoea, and nausea. 
Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab 
The safety profile of Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab is based on the data from 246 patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer in the controlled phase III clinical study (SUNLIGHT). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) are neutropenia (69% [48% ≥ Grade 3]), fatigue (35% 
[3% ≥ Grade 3]), and nausea (33% [1% ≥ Grade 3]). 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) that resulted in treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, 
dose delay, or dose interruption of Lonsurf when used in combination with bevacizumab were 
neutropenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea and anaemia. 
When Lonsurf is used in combination with bevacizumab, the frequency of the following adverse 
reactions was increased compared to Lonsurf as monotherapy: neutropenia (69% vs 53%), severe 
neutropenia (48% vs 34%), thrombocytopenia (24% vs 16%), stomatitis (11% vs 6%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions observed from the 533 treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the 
placebo-controlled Phase III (RECOURSE) clinical study, the 335 treated patients with metastatic 
gastric cancer in the placebo-controlled Phase III (TAGS) clinical study, the 246 patients treated with 
Lonsurf in monotherapy and the 246 patients treated with Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab 
for metastatic colorectal cancer in the controlled Phase III (SUNLIGHT) clinical study are shown in 
Table 6. They are classified according to System Organ Class (SOC) and the appropriate Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory (MedDRA) term is used to describe a certain drug reaction and its 
synonyms and related conditions. 
Adverse reactions known to occur with Lonsurf given alone or with bevacizumab may occur during 
treatment with these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not reported in 
clinical trials with combination therapy. 
Adverse reactions are grouped according to their frequencies. Frequency groups are defined by the 
following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to < 
1/100); and rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000).  
Within each frequency group, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Elderly 
Patients 65 years of age or older who received Lonsurf as monotherapy had a higher incidence (≥ 5%) 
of the following treatment-related adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years: 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutropenia (58.9% vs 48.2%), severe neutropenia (41.3% vs 27.9%), anaemia (36.5% vs 25.2%), 
severe anaemia (14.1% vs 8.9%), decreased appetite (22.6% vs 17.4%), and thrombocytopenia (21.4% 
vs 12.1%).When Lonsurf is used in combination with bevacizumab, patients 65 years of age or older 
had a higher incidence (≥ 5%) of the following treatment-related adverse events compared to patients 
younger than 65 years: neutropenia (75.0% vs 65.1%), severe neutropenia (57.0% vs 41.8%), fatigue 
(39.0% vs 32.2%), thrombocytopenia (28.0% vs 20.5%), and stomatitis (14.0% vs 8.9%). 
Infections 
In the Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies, treatment-related infections occurred more 
frequently in Lonsurf-treated patients (5.8%) compared to those receiving placebo (1.8%). 
In the clinical study in combination with bevacizumab, treatment-related infections occurred similarly 
in patients who received Lonsurf with bevacizumab (2.8%) compared to Lonsurf-treated patients 
(2.4%). 
Proteinuria 
In the Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies, treatment-related proteinuria occurred more 
frequently in Lonsurf-treated patients (1.8%) compared to those receiving placebo (0.9%), all of which 
were Grade 1 or 2 in severity (see section 4.4). 
In the clinical study in combination with bevacizumab, one patient who received Lonsurf with 
bevacizumab (0.4%) reported a treatment-related proteinuria which was Grade 2 and none among the 
Lonsurf-treated patients (see section 4.4). 
Radiotherapy 
There was a slightly higher incidence of overall haematological and myelosuppression-related adverse 
reactions for patients who received prior radiotherapy compared to patients without prior radiotherapy 
in RECOURSE (54.6% versus 49.2%, respectively), of note febrile neutropenia was higher in 
Lonsurf-treated patients who received prior radiotherapy vs. those that did not. 
In the clinical study in combination with bevacizumab, no increase of incidence of overall 
haematological and myelosuppression-related adverse reactions was observed for patients who 
received prior radiotherapy compared to patients without prior radiotherapy in both arms in 
SUNLIGHT: Lonsurf with bevacizumab (73.7% versus 77.4%) and in Lonsurf-treated patients (64.7% 
versus 67.7%). 
Post-marketing experience in patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer 
There have been reports of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving Lonsurf post approval.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest dose of Lonsurf administered in clinical studies was 180 mg/m2 per day. 
The adverse drug reactions reported in association with overdoses were consistent with the established 
safety profile. 
The primary anticipated complication of an overdose is bone marrow suppression. 
There is no known antidote for an overdose of Lonsurf.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medical management of an overdose should include customary therapeutic and supportive medical 
intervention aimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations and preventing their possible 
complications. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, ATC code: L01BC59 
Mechanism of action 
Lonsurf is comprised of an antineoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, trifluridine, and the 
thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride, at a molar ratio 1:0.5 (weight ratio, 
1:0.471).  
Following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine is phosphorylated by thymidine kinase, further 
metabolised in cells to a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) substrate, and incorporated directly into DNA, 
thereby interfering with DNA function to prevent cell proliferation.  
However, trifluridine is rapidly degraded by TPase and readily metabolised by a first-pass effect 
following oral administration, hence the inclusion of the TPase inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride.  
In nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride demonstrated antitumour activity against 
both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. 
The cytotoxic activity of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride against several human tumour xenografts 
correlated highly with the amount of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, suggesting this as the primary 
mechanism of action. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Lonsurf had no clinically relevant effect on QT/QTc prolongation compared with placebo in an open 
label study in patients with advanced solid tumours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Metastatic colorectal cancer 
Randomised phase III study of Lonsurf as monotherapy versus placebo 
The clinical efficacy and safety of Lonsurf were evaluated in an international, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (RECOURSE) in patients with previously treated metastatic 
colorectal cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS), and supportive efficacy 
endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate 
(DCR).  
In total, 800 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Lonsurf (N = 534) plus best supportive care 
(BSC) or matching placebo (N = 266) plus BSC. Lonsurf dosing was based on BSA with a starting 
dose of 35 mg/m2/dose. Study treatment was administered orally twice daily after morning and 
evening meals for 5 days a week with 2-day rest for 2 weeks, followed by 14-day rest, repeated every 
4 weeks. Patients continued therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 
4.2). 
Of the 800 randomised patients, the median age was 63 years, 61% were male, 58% were 
Caucasian/White, 35% were Asian/Oriental, and 1% were Black/African American, and all patients 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
had baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1. The 
primary site of disease was colon (62%) or rectum (38%). KRAS status was wild (49%) or mutant 
(51%) at study entry. The median number of prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease was 3. All 
patients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based 
chemotherapy. All but 1 patient received bevacizumab, and all but 2 patients with KRAS wild type 
tumours received panitumumab or cetuximab. The 2 treatment groups were comparable with respect to 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics. 
An OS analysis of the study, carried out as planned at 72% (N = 574) of events, demonstrated a 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit of Lonsurf plus BSC compared to 
placebo plus BSC (hazard ratio: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.58 to 0.81]; p < 0.0001) and a 
median OS of 7.1 months vs 5.3 months, respectively; with 1-year survival rates of 26.6% and 17.6%, 
respectively. PFS was significantly improved in patients receiving Lonsurf plus BSC (hazard ratio: 
0.48; 95% CI [0.41 to 0.57]; p < 0.0001 (see Table 7, Figure 1 and Figure 2).

An updated OS analysis, carried out at 89% (N = 712) of events, confirmed the clinically meaningful 
and statistically significant survival benefit of Lonsurf plus BSC compared to placebo plus BSC (hazard 
ratio: 0.69; 95% CI [0.59 to 0.81]; p < 0.0001) and a median OS of 7.2 months vs 5.2 months; with 1-
year survival rates of 27.1% and 16.6%, respectively.  
The OS and PFS benefit was observed consistently, in all relevant pre-specified subgroups, including 
race, geographic region, age (< 65; ≥ 65), sex, ECOG PS, KRAS status, time since diagnosis of first 
metastasis, number of metastatic sites, and primary tumour site. The Lonsurf survival benefit was 
maintained after adjusting for all significant prognostic factors, namely, time since diagnosis of first 
metastasis, ECOG PS and number of metastatic sites (hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% CI [0.58 to 0.81]). 
Sixty one percent (61%, N = 485) of all randomised patients received a fluoropyrimidine as part of 
their last treatment regimen prior to randomisation, of which 455 (94%) were refractory to the 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fluoropyrimidine at that time. Among these patients, the OS benefit with Lonsurf was maintained 
(hazard ratio: 0.75, 95% CI [0.59 to 0.94]).  
Eighteen percent (18%, N = 144) of all randomised patients received regorafenib prior to 
randomisation. Among these patients, the OS benefit with Lonsurf was maintained (hazard ratio: 0.69, 
95% CI [0.45 to 1.05]). The effect was also maintained in regorafenib-naive patients (hazard ratio: 
0.69, 95% CI [0.57 to 0.83]). 
The DCR (complete response or partial response or stable disease) was significantly higher in patients 
treated with Lonsurf (44% vs 16%, p < 0.0001). 
Treatment with Lonsurf plus BSC resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of PS <2 in 
comparison to placebo plus BSC. The median time to PS ≥ 2 for the Lonsurf group and placebo group 
was 5.7 months and 4.0 months, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI: [0.56, 0.78]), 
p < 0.0001. 
Randomised phase III study of Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab versus Lonsurf  
The clinical efficacy and safety of Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab, versus Lonsurf 
monotherapy, were evaluated in an international, randomised, open-label, phase III study 
(SUNLIGHT) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been previously treated with a 
maximum of two prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease, including a 
fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody and/or an anti-EGFR 
monoclonal antibody for patients with a RAS wild type tumour. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
overall survival (OS) and the key secondary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).  
In total, 492 patients were randomised (1:1) to receive Lonsurf with bevacizumab (N = 246) or 
Lonsurf monotherapy (N = 246).  
Patients received Lonsurf (starting dose of 35 mg/m2) administered orally twice daily on Days 1 to 5 
and Days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle alone or combined with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) administered 
intravenously every 2 weeks (on days 1 and 15) of each 4-week cycle. Patients continued therapy until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 4.2). Bevacizumab monotherapy was not 
allowed. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age 
was 63 years (range: 20-90), with 44% ≥ 65 years of age and 12% ≥ 75 years of age, 52% of patients 
were male and 95% were white, 46% had ECOG PS 0 and 54% had ECOG PS 1. The primary site of 
disease was colon (73%) or rectum (27%). Overall, 71% of the patients had a RAS mutant tumour. 
The median duration of treatment was 5 months in the Lonsurf-bevacizumab group and 2 months in 
the Lonsurf group. A total of 92% of patients received two prior anticancer treatment regimens for 
advanced CRC, 5% received one and 3% received more than two. All patients received prior 
fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, 72% received prior anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody,94% 
of patients with a RAS wild type tumour received prior anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. 
Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS 
and PFS compared to Lonsurf monotherapy (see Table 8 and Figures 3 and 4).

The OS and PFS benefit was observed consistently, in all randomization strata and pre specified 
subgroups, including gender, age (< 65, ≥ 65 years), location of primary disease (right, left), ECOG 
performance status (0, ≥1), prior surgical resection, number of metastatic sites (1-2, ≥ 3), neutrophils 
to lymphocytes ratio (NLR < 3, NLR ≥ 3), number of prior metastatic drug regimens (1, ≥ 2), BRAF 
status, MSI status, prior bevacizumab and subsequent regorafenib. 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
The clinical efficacy and safety of Lonsurf were evaluated in an international, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (TAGS) in patients with previously treated metastatic gastric 
cancer (including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction), who had been previously treated 
with at least two prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease, including fluoropyrimidine-, 
platinum-, and either taxane- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy, plus if appropriate human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -targeted therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival 
(OS), and supportive efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate 
(ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to deterioration of ECOG performance status ≥2 and quality 
of life (QoL). Tumour assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST), version 1.1, were performed by the investigator/local radiologist every 8 weeks. 
In total, 507 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Lonsurf (N = 337) plus best supportive care 
(BSC) or placebo (N = 170) plus BSC. Lonsurf dosing was based on BSA with a starting dose of 
35 mg/m2/dose. Study treatment was administered orally twice daily after morning and evening meals 
for 5 days a week with 2-day rest for 2 weeks, followed by 14-day rest, repeated every 4 weeks. 
Patients continued therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 4.2). 
Of the 507 randomised patients, the median age was 63 years, 73% were male, 70% were White, 16% 
were Asian, and <1% were Black/African American, and all patients had baseline Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1. Primary cancer was gastric (71.0%) or 
gastroesophageal junction cancer (28.6%) or both (0.4%). The median number of prior regimens of 
therapy for metastatic disease was 3. Nearly all (99.8%) patients received prior fluoropyrimidine, 
100% received prior platinum therapy and 90.5% received prior taxane therapy. Approximately half 
(55.4%) of patients received prior irinotecan, 33.3% received prior ramucirumab, and 16.6% received 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prior HER2-targeted therapy. The 2 treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic 
and baseline disease characteristics. 
An OS analysis of the study, carried out as planned at 76% (N = 384) of events, demonstrated that 
Lonsurf plus BSC resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to placebo plus 
BSC with an hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.85; 1- and 2-sided p-values were 0.0003 and 
0.0006, respectively) corresponding to a 31% reduction in the risk of death in the Lonsurf group. The 
median OS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.2) for the Lonsurf group versus 3.6 months (95% CI: 3.1, 
4.1) for the placebo group; with 1-year survival rates of 21.2% and 13.0%, respectively.  
PFS was significantly improved in patients receiving Lonsurf plus BSC compared to placebo plus 
BSC (HR of 0.57; 95% CI [0.47 to 0.70]; p < 0.0001 (see Table 9, Figure 5 and Figure 6).

Months from Randomisation 
The OS and PFS benefit was observed consistently, in all randomization strata and across most 
pre-specified subgroups, including sex, age (< 65; ≥ 65 years), ethnic origin, ECOG PS, prior 
ramucirumab treatment, prior irinotecan treatment, number of prior regimens (2; 3; ≥ 4), previous 
gastrectomy, primary tumour site (gastric; gastroesophageal junction) and HER2 status. 
The ORR (complete response + partial response) was not significantly higher in patients treated with 
Lonsurf (4.5% vs 2.1 %, p-value = 0.2833) but the DCR (complete response or partial response or 
stable disease) was significantly higher in patients treated with Lonsurf (44.1% vs 14.5%, p < 0.0001). 
The median time to deterioration of ECOG performance status to ≥2 was 4.3 months for the Lonsurf 
group versus 2.3 months for the placebo group with HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.562, 0.854), 
p-value = 0.0005.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lonsurf in all subsets of the paediatric population in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer and in 
refractory metastatic gastric cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Elderly 
There is limited data in Lonsurf treated patients aged 75 years and above: 
- 87 patients (10%) in pooled data of the RECOURSE and TAGS studies, of which 2 patients were 85 
years or older. The effect of Lonsurf on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years and ≥65 
years of age. 
- 58 patients (12%) were aged 75 years and above, of which 1 patient was 85 years or older in the 
SUNLIGHT study. The effect of Lonsurf in combination with bevacizumab on overall survival was 
similar in patients < 65 years and ≥ 65 years of age. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration of Lonsurf with [14C]-trifluridine, at least 57% of the administered 
trifluridine was absorbed and only 3% of the dose was excreted into faeces. After oral administration 
of Lonsurf with [14C]-tipiracil hydrochloride, at least 27% of the administered tipiracil hydrochloride 
was absorbed and 50% of the total radioactivity dose measured into faeces, suggestive of moderate 
gastrointestinal absorption of tipiracil hydrochloride. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following a single dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the mean 
times to peak plasma concentrations (tmax) of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were around 2 
hours and 3 hours, respectively. 
In the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses of the multiple dose administration of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose, 
twice daily for 5 days a week with 2-day rest for 2 weeks followed by a 14-day rest, repeated every 4 
weeks), trifluridine area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable 
concentration (AUC0-last) was approximately 3-fold higher and maximum concentration (Cmax) was 
approximately 2-fold higher after multiple dose administration (Day 12 of Cycle 1) of Lonsurf than 
after single-dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1). 
However, there was no accumulation for tipiracil hydrochloride, and no further accumulation of 
trifluridine with successive cycles (Day 12 of Cycles 2 and 3) of administration of Lonsurf. Following 
multiple doses of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose twice daily) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the 
mean times to peak plasma concentrations (tmax) of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were around 
2 hours and 3 hours, respectively. 
Contribution of tipiracil hydrochloride 
Single-dose administration of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose) increased the mean AUC0-last of trifluridine by 
37-fold and Cmax by 22-fold with reduced variability compared to trifluridine alone (35 mg/m2/dose). 
Effect of food 
When Lonsurf at a single dose of 35 mg/m2 was administered to 14 patients with solid tumours after a 
standardised high-fat, high-calorie meal, trifluridine area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 
did not change, but trifluridine Cmax, tipiracil hydrochloride Cmax and AUC decreased by 
approximately 40% compared to those in a fasting state. In clinical studies Lonsurf was administered 
within 1 hour after completion of the morning and evening meals (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
The protein binding of trifluridine in human plasma was over 96% and trifluridine bound mainly to 
human serum albumin. Plasma protein binding of tipiracil hydrochloride was below 8%. Following a 
single dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the apparent volume of 
distribution (Vd/F) for trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride was 21 L and 333 L, respectively.  
Biotransformation 
Trifluridine was mainly eliminated by metabolism via TPase to form an inactive metabolite, FTY. The 
absorbed trifluridine was metabolised, and excreted into urine as FTY and trifluridine glucuronide 
isomers. Other minor metabolites, 5-carboxyuracil and 5-carboxy-2’-deoxyuridine, were detected, but 
those levels in plasma and urine were at low or trace levels. 
Tipiracil hydrochloride was not metabolised in human liver S9 or in cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes. Tipiracil hydrochloride was the major component and 6-hydroxymethyluracil was the 
major metabolite consistently in human plasma, urine, and faeces. 
Elimination 
Following the multiple-dose administration of Lonsurf at the recommended dose and regimen, the 
mean elimination half-life (t1/2) for trifluridine on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and on Day 12 of Cycle 1 were 1.4 
hours and 2.1 hours, respectively. The mean t1/2 values for tipiracil hydrochloride on Day 1 of Cycle 1 
and on Day 12 of Cycle 1 were 2.1 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. 
Following a single dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the oral 
clearance (CL/F) for trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were 10.5 L/hr and 109 L/hr, respectively. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After single oral administration of Lonsurf with [14C]-trifluridine, the total cumulative excretion of 
radioactivity was 60% of the administered dose. The majority of recovered radioactivity was 
eliminated into urine (55% of the dose) within 24 hours, and the excretion into faeces and expired air 
was less than 3% for both. After single oral administration of Lonsurf with [14C]-tipiracil 
hydrochloride, recovered radioactivity was 77% of the dose, which consisted of 27% urinary excretion 
and 50% faecal excretion. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In a dose finding study (15 to 35 mg/m2 twice daily), the AUC from time 0 to 10 hours (AUC0-10) of 
trifluridine tended to increase more than expected based on the increase in dose; however, oral 
clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of trifluridine were generally constant at 
the dose range of 20 to 35 mg/m2. As for the other exposure parameters of trifluridine and tipiracil 
hydrochloride, those appeared to be dose proportional. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Age, gender and race 
Based on the population PK analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender or race on the 
PK of trifluridine or tipiracil hydrochloride. 
Renal impairment 
Of the 533 patients in the RECOURSE study who received Lonsurf, 306 (57%) patients had normal 
renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min), 178 (33%) patients had mild renal impairment (CrCl 60 to 
89 mL/min), and 47 (9%) had moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min), with data missing 
for 2 patients. Patients with severe renal impairment were not enrolled in the study.  
Based on a population PK analysis, the exposure of Lonsurf in patients with mild renal impairment 
(CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) was similar to those in patients with normal renal function 
(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min). A higher exposure of Lonsurf was observed in moderate renal impairment (CrCl 
= 30 to 59 mL/min). Estimated (CrCl) was a significant covariate for CL/F in both final models of 
trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride. The mean relative ratio of AUC in patients with mild (n=38) 
and moderate (n=16) renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function (n=84) were 
1.31 and 1.43 for trifluridine, respectively, and 1.34 and 1.65 for tipiracil hydrochloride, respectively. 
In a dedicated study the pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were evaluated in 
cancer patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥90 mL/min, N=12), mild renal impairment (CrCl 
=60 to 89 mL/min, N=12), moderate renal impairment (CrCl =30 to 59 mL/min, N=11), or severe 
renal impairment (CrCl =15 to 29 mL/min, N=8). Patients with severe renal impairment received an 
adjusted starting dose of 20 mg/m2 twice daily (reduced to 15 mg/m2 twice daily based on individual 
safety and tolerability). The effect of renal impairment after repeated administration was a 1.6- and 
1.4-fold increase of trifluridine total exposure in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, 
respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function; Cmax remained similar. The total 
exposure of tipiracil hydrochloride in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment after 
repeated administration was 2.3- and 4.1-fold higher, respectively, compared to patients with normal 
renal function; this being linked to a more decreased clearance with increasing renal impairment. The 
PK of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride have not been studied in patients with end-stage renal 
disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min or requiring dialysis) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on the population PK analysis, liver function parameters including alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 
36-2322 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 11-197 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 
5-182 U/L) , and total bilirubin (0.17-3.20 mg/dL) were not significant covariates for PK parameters 
of either trifluridine or tipiracil hydrochloride. Serum albumin was found to significantly affect 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
trifluridine clearance, with a negative correlation. For low albumin values ranging from 2.2 to 
3.5 g/dL, the corresponding clearance values range from 4.2 to 3.1 L/h. 
In a dedicated study the PK of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were evaluated in cancer patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (National Cancer Institute [NCI] Criteria Group B and C, 
respectively) and in patients with normal hepatic function. Based upon limited data with a 
considerable variability, no statistically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics 
in patients with normal hepatic function versus patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No 
correlation was seen for trifluridine nor tipiracil hydrochloride between PK parameters and AST 
or/and total blood bilirubin. Half-life time (t1/2) and the accumulation ratio of trifluridine and tipiracil 
hydrochloride were similar between the moderate, mild and normal hepatic function patients. 
There is no need for a starting dose adjustment in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 
4.2). 
Gastrectomy 
The influence of gastrectomy on PK parameters was not able to be examined in the population PK 
analysis because there were few patients who had undergone gastrectomy (1% of overall). 
In vitro interaction studies  
Trifluridine is a substrate of TPase, but is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP). Tipiracil 
hydrochloride is not metabolised in either human liver S9 or cryopreserved hepatocytes. 
In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and FTY (inactive metabolite of 
trifluridine) did not inhibit the CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5). In vitro evaluation indicated that 
trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and FTY had no inductive effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or 
CYP3A4/5. Thus trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride are not expected to cause or be subject to a 
significant medicinal product interaction mediated by CYP. 
In vitro evaluation of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride was conducted using human uptake and 
efflux transporters (trifluridine with MDR1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP; tipiracil hydrochloride 
with OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, MDR1 and BCRP). Neither trifluridine nor tipiracil 
hydrochloride was an inhibitor of or substrate for human uptake and efflux transporters based on in 
vitro studies, except for OCT2 and MATE1. Tipiracil hydrochloride was an inhibitor of OCT2 and 
MATE1 in vitro, but at concentrations substantially higher than human plasma Cmax at steady state. 
Thus it is unlikely to cause an interaction with other medicinal products, at recommended doses, due 
to inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1. Transport of tipiracil hydrochloride by OCT2 and MATE1 might 
be affected when Lonsurf is administered concomitantly with inhibitors of OCT2 and MATE1. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
The efficacy and safety of Lonsurf in metastatic colorectal cancer was compared between a 
high-exposure group (>median) and a low-exposure group (≤median) based on the median AUC value 
of trifluridine. OS appeared more favourable in the high AUC group compared to the low AUC group 
(median OS of 9.3 vs. 8.1 months, respectively). All AUC groups performed better than placebo 
throughout the follow-up period. The incidences of Grade ≥3 neutropenia were higher in the 
high-trifluridine AUC group (47.8%) compared with the low-trifluridine AUC group (30.4%). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Toxicology assessment of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride was performed in rats, dogs and 
monkeys. The target organs identified were the lymphatic and haematopoietic systems and the 
gastrointestinal tract. All changes, i.e., leukopenia, anaemia, bone marrow hypoplasia, atrophic 
changes in the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues and the gastrointestinal tract, were reversible 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
within 9 weeks of drug withdrawal. Whitening, breakage, and malocclusion were observed in teeth of 
rats treated with trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride, which are considered rodent specific and not 
relevant for human.  
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis 
No long term studies evaluating the carcinogenic potential of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride in 
animals have been performed. Trifluridine was shown to be genotoxic in a reverse mutation test in 
bacteria, a chromosomal aberration test in mammal-cultured cells, and a micronucleus test in mice. 
Therefore, Lonsurf should be treated as a potential carcinogen. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Results of animal studies did not indicate an effect of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride on male 
and female fertility in rats. The increases in the corpus luteum count and implanting embryo count 
observed in female rats at high doses were not considered adverse (see section 4.6). Lonsurf has been 
shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats when given at dose 
levels lower than the clinical exposure. No peri/post-natal developmental toxicity studies have been 
performed.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lonsurf is and what it is used for  
Lonsurf is a type of cancer chemotherapy which belongs to the group of medicines called "cytostatic 
antimetabolite medicines". 
Lonsurf contains two different active substances: trifluridine and tipiracil. 
•  Trifluridine stops the growth of cancer cells. 
•  Tipiracil stops the trifluridine from being broken down by the body, helping trifluridine to work 
longer. 
Lonsurf is used to treat adults with colon or rectal cancer - sometimes called ‘colorectal’ cancer and 
stomach cancer (including cancer of the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach).  
•  It is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastases).  
•  It is used when other treatments have not worked - or when other treatments are not suitable for 
you. 
Lonsurf may be given in combination with bevacizumab. It is important that you also read the package 
leaflet of bevacizumab. If you have any questions about this medicine, ask your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Lonsurf 
Do not take Lonsurf  
•  if you are allergic to trifluridine or tipiracil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Do not take Lonsurf if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking 
Lonsurf. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lonsurf if: 
•  you have kidney problems 
•  you have liver problems 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lonsurf.  
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Treatment may lead to the following side effects (see section 4): 
• 
 a reduced number of certain types of white blood cells (neutropenia) which are important for 
protecting the body against bacterial or fungal infections. As a consequence of neutropenia, fever 
(febrile neutropenia) and blood infection (septic shock) may occur  
a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia)  
a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop 
bleeding and work by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries  
• 
• 
•  gastrointestinal problems. 
Tests and checks 
Your doctor will do blood tests before each cycle of Lonsurf. You start a new cycle every 4 weeks. 
The tests are needed because Lonsurf can sometimes affect your blood cells. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. This is 
because it may not work or be safe. 
Other medicines and Lonsurf 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Lonsurf can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect 
the way Lonsurf works. 
In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines used for treatment of HIV, such 
as zidovudine. This is because zidovudine may not work as well if you are taking Lonsurf. Talk to 
your doctor about whether to switch to a different HIV medicine. 
If the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Lonsurf. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Lonsurf may harm your 
unborn baby.  
If you become pregnant, you and your doctor will have to decide if the benefits of Lonsurf are greater 
than the risk of harm to the baby.  
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Lonsurf as it is not known whether Lonsurf passes into the 
mother’s milk. 
Contraception 
You must not become pregnant while taking this medicine. This is because it may harm your unborn 
baby.  
You and your partner should use effective methods of contraception while taking this medicine. You 
should also do this for 6 months after you stop taking the medicine. If you or your partner become 
pregnant during this time, you must talk to your doctor or pharmacist straight away. 
Fertility 
Lonsurf may affect your ability to have a baby. Talk to your doctor for advice before using it. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not known whether Lonsurf changes your ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use any 
tools or machines if you experience symptoms that affect your ability to concentrate and react.  
Lonsurf contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.

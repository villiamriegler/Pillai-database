SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Annex II and 
Entecavir Accord in the approved indication remains 
PL 
favourable and therefore recommended the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation with unlimited validity.

Study of DACOGEN in sequential administration with 
Cytarabine in children aged 1 month to <18 years 
with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, 
provided as per the requirement of article 46. The 
RMP version 3.3 (in line with the revision 2 of the 
RMP template) has also been submitted.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update section 4.4 of 
the SmPC to align the safety warning related to 
sodium excipient with the Annex to the revised 
European Commission guideline on `Excipients in the 
labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products 
for human use'. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. Moreover, the contact details of the local 
representative in Slovenia have been updated in the 
Package Leaflet.

day administered on Days 1 to 5 followed by cytarabine on 
Days 8 to 12 for up to 4 cycles.. Reported adverse events 
were consistent with the known safety profile of Dacogen in 
adults. No efficacy was observed in children aged 1 month 
to < 18 years with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). Of the 17 subjects enrolled in the study, 
14 subjects died, the majority of these were due to disease 
progression. Therefore, the results of this study do not 
support a paediatric indication.  Based on this, the SmPC 
has been updated with the results of the phase I/II 
paediatric study and to recommend that Dacogen should 
not be used in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
aged < 18 years, because efficacy was not established.

Published literature identified 86 publications of which 18 
to add the adverse events "Hepatic Function 
abnormal" with the frequency very common and 
"Hyperbilirubinaemia" with the frequency common, 
as well as to include clinical recommendations in 
patients developing signs or symptoms of hepatic 
impairment based on a cumulative review of post-
marketing data and clinical literature; the Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. Moreover, the existing 
Labelling and

PL 
hyperbilirubinemia, elevated AST/ALT and related 
hepatobiliary disorders. Moreover, severe elevated bilirubin 
and/or cholestatic events were observed, including severe 
LFT elevations with positive dechallenge. Based on this 
cumulative review, it is considered that hepatotoxicity with 
elevated LFT and bilirubine is associated with the use of 
decitabine. 
Page 4/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, changes to the product information of Dacogen 
are recommended in order to add the adverse events 
“hepatic function abnormal” with a frequency “very 
common”, and “hyperbilirubinaemia” with a frequency 
“common” as new hepatobiliary disorders in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. In addition, the existing warning for hepatic 
impairment is updated in section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
include clinical recommendations for patients who develop 
signs or symptoms. 
wording for the warning of patients with renal 
impairment has been revised in alignment with 
recommendation on patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update the contact 
details of the local representative in Portugal in the 
Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the term “(for pH 
adjustment)” has been removed from the Annex IIIA 
in accordance with the revision 2 of the European 
Commission guideline on Excipients in the labelling 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use.

threshold for pyrogenic dose of bacterial endotoxins as 
defined in Chapter 5.1.10 'Guidelines for using the test for 
bacterial endotoxins' in edition 8.8 of the European 
Pharmacopoeia the concentration range of the final product 
for administration has been narrowed from '0.1 mg/ml-1.0 
mg/ml' to '0.15 mg/ml-1.0 mg/ml' to comply with this 
recent Ph.Eur revision. Dacogen powder should be 
aseptically reconstituted with 10 ml of water for injections. 
Upon reconstitution, each ml contains approximately 5 mg 
of decitabine at pH 6.7 to 7.3. Within 15 minutes of 
reconstitution, the solution must be further diluted with 
cold infusion fluids (sodium chloride 9 mg/ml [0.9%] 
solution for injection or 5% glucose solution for injection) 
to a final concentration of 0.15 to 1.0 mg/ml. The posology 
and the method of administration are not changed as 
consequence of the change of the dilution.

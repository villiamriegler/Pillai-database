Brief description of 
the product 
Chemical class: Biotechnological, nucleic acid based, gene 
therapy medicinal product 
Summary of mode of action:  
Following single intravenous infusion, etranacogene 
dezaparvovec preferentially targets liver cells, where the vector 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) resides almost exclusively in 
episomal form. After transduction, etranacogene dezaparvovec 
directs long-term liver-specific expression of Factor IX-Padua 
protein. As a result, etranacogene dezaparvovec partially or 
completely ameliorates the deficiency of circulating Factor IX 
(FIX) procoagulant activity in patients with Hemophilia B, 
restoring the hemostatic potential.

Part II:  Safety Specification 
Part II:  Module SI - Epidemiology of the indications and target 
population 
Hemgenix is indicated for the treatment of severe and moderately severe Hemophilia B 
(congenital Factor IX deficiency) in adult patients without a history of Factor IX inhibitors.  
Congenital Hemophilia B is an inherited X-chromosome linked bleeding disorder 
characterized by an increased bleeding tendency due to either a partial or complete deficiency 
of the essential blood coagulation factor, factor IX.  
Incidence - Prevalence 
According to the January 2021 Orphanet Report Series, the global birth prevalence / 
incidence of Hemophilia B is 1.665 per 100,000 individuals and the estimated European 
Union (EU) prevalence of Hemophilia B is 3 per 100,000 individuals (Orphanet, 2021).  
World Federation of Hemophilia estimated prevalence at birth from the FranceCoag data to 
be 5 per 100,000 males. The birth prevalence of Hemophilia B is approximately 1 in 20,000 
live male births worldwide. Prevalence is approximately 1 in 25,000 males in the United 
States of America (US) and EU (WFH, 2020).  
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication and risk factors for the disease 
Demographics 
Hemophilia B is an X-chromosome linked recessive disorder; it is therefore more common in 
men (87%) than in women (5%) (unknown gender [6%]) (WFH, 2020). Most female carriers 
of hemophilia are asymptomatic, having a factor IX mutation on one X chromosome and one 
working copy of the factor IX gene on the other X chromosome. While hemophilia can occur 
in females, it is extremely rare; bleeding symptoms can occur in ~10% of female carriers 
(Scott, 2014). The disorder is lifelong (ie, occurs in all age groups) and is found in all ethnic 
groups.  
Risk factors for the disease:  
Hemophilia B is an X-chromosome linked disorder. Family history of hemophilia and carrier 
mother are the main risk factors. Generally, point mutations in the ‘coagulation factor IX’ 
gene (F9) can lead to severe Hemophilia B (Scott, 2014). Approximately two-thirds of

CSL Behring

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
patients with hemophilia have a family history of bleeding. In the remaining one-third of 
patients, hemophilia results from spontaneous gene mutation. In such cases, 80% of mothers 
are carriers of a de novo mutated allele (Fauci et al, 2008).  
The main existing treatment options:  
Hemophilia B care is based on regular replacement therapy (prophylaxis) with hemostatic 
agents to prevent bleeding, or episodic therapy (also known as “on demand”) with a 
hemostatic agent after bleedings (WFH guideline, 2020).  
There is no cure for Hemophilia B. The primary goals of Hemophilia B therapy are 
prevention of bleeding episodes, rapid and definitive treatment of bleeding episodes 
(breakthrough bleeds) that occur even while on a regular prophylactic regimen, and provision 
of adequate haemostasis during surgery and emergencies.  
Currently, these goals are essentially met for patients with Hemophilia B through IV 
injections of recombinant or plasma-derived factor IX products, either at the time of a bleed 
(episodic) or by regular infusions (prophylaxis). Standard half-life factor IX products are 
administered as prophylaxis every other day to 3 times a week, while extended half-life 
recombinant FIX products allow less frequent dosing with routine infusions every 
7, 10, or 14 days to prevent bleeding. Plasma and whole blood products are less effective than 
recombinant factor IX products since they contain lower concentrations of factor IX. They 
also convey risks of circulation overload, heart failure and viral contaminations. Recombinant 
factor IX products are widely accepted as the optimal treatment and are used in developed 
countries; fresh frozen plasma is the only product available in several developing countries.  
Episodic therapy is highly effective at arresting hemorrhages. In patients with severe 
Hemophilia B, spontaneous bleeding episodes can be dramatically reduced when plasma 
factor IX activity levels are maintained continuously above 1% of normal 
(0.01 International Unit [IU]/mL) by prophylactic administration of factor IX protein. Since 
prophylaxis can reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeds and help reduce or prevent joint 
damage (Manco- Johnson et al, 2007; Valentino et al, 2015), it has become the standard of 
care in countries with access to adequate quantities of clotting factor concentrates. However, 
use of current prophylaxis products requires life-long, regular iv administration, an invasive 
and inconvenient process.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the population, including mortality and 
morbidity:  
Hemophilia B manifests as profuse bleeding into joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can 
lead to chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function. Prophylaxis with factor IX 
replacement products in patients with Hemophilia B reduces the risk for spontaneous bleeds 
but does not eliminate them completely. Breakthrough bleedings particularly in the joints and 
muscles still occur in many patients on prophylaxis when factor IX activity levels are low. As 
few as only 1 or 2 bleeding episodes in a single joint, might potentially initiate the process of 
inflammation, leading to synovitis and chronic joint damage or hemophilic arthropathy 
(Dodd and Watts, 2012; Fischer and Hermans, 2013).  
Chronic debilitating joint disease results from recurrent bleeding into the joint, synovial 
membrane inflammation, hypertrophy, cartilage damage, joint instability, subsequent atrophy 
of the muscles supporting the joint, and eventually, destructive arthritis. Chronic joint 
deformities that need to be managed by an orthopedic specialist may occur. Finally, joint 
replacement(s) may be needed.  
Severe disease leads to spontaneous life-threatening bleeding episodes resulting in deaths and 
morbidity from chronic joint disease. When untreated, most individuals with severe 
Hemophilia B die from bleeding complications before 25 years of age. Even in the era of 
adequate factor replacement products, the hallmark of Hemophilia B is the lifelong 
propensity for bleeding (WFH, 2020).  
The introduction of virus inactivation techniques in the preparation of plasma-derived 
concentrates in the 1980s, as well as the production of recombinant factors, greatly improved 
the safety of replacement therapy. Since then, the lifespan of hemophilia patients has 
progressively approached that of males in the general population, at least in high-income 
countries. A Dutch study followed 1066 patients from 2001 to 2018 and found that the 
median life expectancy of hemophilia patients was 77 years. While this is still lower than that 
of the general population, it has increased from the calculated lifespan of 70 years that was 
found in a similar study that followed patients from 1992 to 2001. This recent study also 
found the most common causes of death in hemophilia patients were intracranial bleeding 
and malignancies. Chronic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome were also causes of death related to Hemophilia but occurred 
less frequently (Hassan et al, 2020). The overall life expectancy in human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)-negative patients with severe Hemophilia A or B in the United Kingdom was 63

CSL Behring

Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
years, which is about 15 years lower than the general male population (Darby et al, 2007). 
With adequate prophylactic treatment, and without liver complications (e.g., HIV or Hepatitis 
C virus [HCV]), the life expectancy in patients with severe hemophilia can approach that of 
the general male population (Plug et al, 2004; Osooli et al, 2017). All-cause mortality rates in 
the hemophilia population due to coagulation defects and due to intracranial hemorrhage 
(HIC) are significantly increased compared to the general population.  
Approximately 3 to 5% of patients with severe Hemophilia B develop alloantibody inhibitors 
that can neutralize native and administered FIX and render replacement ineffective. These 
inhibitors are usually immunoglobulin G (IgG) and often appear after approximately 
10 infusions of FIX concentrate (Chitlur et al, 2009; Di Michele, 2011; Warrier, 1999). 
However, they may appear at any time in the patient’s life. Inhibitor development is 
considered the most severe problem in hemophilia care today as it affects the efficacy of 
patient treatment, increases the risk of developing joint bleeds (Oladapo et al, 2018), 
increases the cost of hemophilia care, and leads to increased morbidity. Of note, inhibitor 
incidence in Hemophilia B is not well defined. Since Hemophilia B is a rare disease, it is 
difficult to obtain sufficient number of previously untreated patients (PUPs) to conduct large 
cohort and prospective studies focusing on the inhibitor incidence in Hemophilia B patients 
(Santoro et al, 2018). The incidence of FIX inhibitors has been reported to range between 
1.5 and 5% of all patients with Hemophilia B (Di Michele, 2011; Annoni et al, 2013), with 
inhibitors rarely seen in mild or moderate disease. PedNet conducted a recent study to 
explore the incidence of inhibitor development in severe Hemophilia B patients followed up 
for up to 500 Exposure Days (ED). The cumulative inhibitor incidence was 9.3% 
(95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 4.4 to 14.1) at 75 ED, and 10.2% (95% CI: 5.1 to 15.3) at 
500 ED (Male et al, 2020).  
The burden of Hemophilia is high for the individual patient, their families and for society. 
Patients may not be able to participate in certain activities (e.g, contact sports), and may 
encounter long-term impairments in mobility and functional status leading to absence from 
school or work. Issues may surface with social participation and peer integration, particularly 
when children are growing up. Hemophilia patients are less likely to proceed into full-time 
employment and occupational disability is more frequent (Fischer and Hermans, 2013). 
Living with Hemophilia can have a substantial effect on mental wellbeing, with anxiety and 
depression having an increased prevalence in persons with Hemophilia (PWH), compared to 
the general population (Al-Huniti et al, 2020). A systematic literature review revealed the 
significant economic burden associated with Hemophilia B in the US and the substantial 
costs and health resources utilized by Hemophilia B patients (Li et al, 2019).

Treatment adherence is a key challenge at 2 transition points: when young people with 
hemophilia switch to self-infusion, and again when they move away from home and assume 
the full responsibility of self-care. Adherence to prophylaxis has been found to be suboptimal 
in many adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and young adults (18 to 30 years of age) with 
Hemophilia. In general, the main barriers to adherence to prophylaxis include high perceived 
burden of treatment, no or low burden of bleeds and symptoms, venous access difficulties, 
and viewing prophylaxis as complicated and time-consuming (WFH, 2020).  
Important co-morbidities:  
Consequences of bleeding:  
Hemophilia is characterized by increased bleeding into joints and muscles (Dunn, 2011; 
Plug, 2004). Repeated bleeding into joints may result in physical disability owing to 
hemophilic arthritis (Aledort, 1994).  
Although prophylaxis in hemophilia started in the pediatric population, its use in adults is 
now well established. Prophylaxis has the dual benefit of reducing the risk of joint bleeds as 
well as intracerebral hemorrhage. HIC remains a significant contributor to morbidity and 
mortality in patients with both severe and non-severe hemophilia (Payne et al, 2017). The 
aging PWH who have not been treated with routine prophylaxis since birth will likely 
experience physical disability due to hemophilic arthropathy, chronic pain and reduced 
muscle bulk, all of which will contribute to abnormal gait and predisposition to falls 
(Sammels et al, 2014).  
Osteoarthritis is becoming more of an issue especially in combination with hemophilic 
arthropathy. Joint replacements especially of the knee, elbow and ankle are now routinely 
performed in the larger Hemophilia centers in patients with mean ages in their 30’s to 40’s; as 
patients with Hemophilia live longer and are operated at a relatively young age, redo and 
revision joint surgery is more often encountered (Beeton et al, 2000; Silva and Luck, 2005; 
Rodriguez-Merchan, 2007; Goddard et al, 2010; Song et al, 2018).  
Chu et al, 2018 performed a longitudinal population-based study using Taiwan’s National 
Health Insurance Research Database to compare the incidence of comorbidities and their risk 
factors among 411 workers with those in an age- and sex-matched general population 
(n=1600). Compared with the general population, workers with hemophilia were found to 
have higher risks for hemorrhagic stroke, arthritis/arthropathy, and knee or hip replacement

after multivariate adjustment, with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 4.60 (2.81 to 7.53), 
4.03 (3.34 to 4.87), and 1.29 (1.10 to 1.41), respectively.  
Age-related comorbidities:  
Modern treatments, as well as general improvements in health care and living standards, are 
constantly changing the demography of Hemophilia. The life expectancy of Hemophilia B 
patients is steadily approaching that of the general population (Canaro, 2015). Comorbidities 
that trend with age, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity are affecting 
the older hemophilia population. Such issues predispose these individuals to chronic diseases 
such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. The older hemophilia population 
faces additional complications, such as joint arthropathy and complications related to HIV 
and HCV infection, which impact the incidence of cancer and liver disease in this population. 
For patients with severe hemophilia in particular, adequate management of comorbidities is 
frequently compromised by the increased risk of hemorrhage. As the demographic shift 
continues, hemophilia care centers can expect to encounter more patients with greater levels 
of complexity (Berntorp, 2015).  
Cardiovascular diseases:  
It has been suggested in the literature that cardiovascular-related mortality may be reduced in 
patients with hemophilia, due to a protective effect resulting from the disease 
(Biere-Rafi et al, 2010; Darby et al, 2007). However, data are often conflicting and with the 
hemophilia population aging, it is now recognized that many risk factors, such as 
hypertension and overweight, occur quite frequently in PWH (Kempton et al, 2021).  
A large cross-sectional study from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands found that the 
prevalence of hypertension (defined as blood pressure [BP] > 140/80 mmHg and/or use of 
antihypertensive medication) was higher in a cohort of older Hemophilia patients (≥ 30 yr) 
compared with a healthy age-matched male population (49 vs. 40%). Moreover, the 
prevalence increased with age, rising from 53% in patients aged 50 to 59 years to > 80% in 
patients aged 60 years or older, and was higher in patients with severe Hemophilia than in 
those with mild or moderate disease (Fransen van de Putte, 2012). Furthermore, the data 
demonstrated that the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was greater using the 
QRISK 2 score (an online assessment tool for estimating the 10‑year risk of having a 
cardiovascular event, in people who do not already have heart disease) in men with 
Hemophilia over the age of 40 compared to the general population (8.9 vs. 6.7%).

These data are mirrored by a study from the United States (US) in which hypertension 
prevalence in adult hemophilia patients (≥ 18 yr) was compared with that of a nationally 
representative sample provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 
The results showed that the prevalence of hypertension was greater in hemophilia patients 
compared to the general population (49.1 vs. 31.7%), increased with age, and was higher in 
patients with moderate or severe hemophilia than in those with mild disease 
(von Drygalski, 2013).  
Another cross-sectional study covered a 5-year period and included PWH aged ≥ 35 years 
who were cared for at a single hemophilia treatment center in the United States. Medical 
records were extensively reviewed to collect the information about cardiovascular events. 
The study cohort comprised 185 PWH (102 Hemophilia A and 83 Hemophilia B). Lifetime 
prevalence of a cardiovascular event was 19.5% (36/185, 95% CI 13.8 to 25.2%). Compared 
with US non-Hispanic White males, PWH had about twice the prevalence of coronary artery 
disease, stroke and myocardial infarction (Sharathkumar et al, 2011).  
In individuals without hemophilia, hypertension is a significant risk factor for HIC, with the 
risk doubling for each increase of 20 mmHg in systolic BP or 10 mmHg in diastolic BP 
(Kim et al, 2005; Lewington et al, 2002; Song et al, 2004). In hemophilia patients, the rate of 
HIC is approximately 20 to 50 times higher than that in the general population 
(Giroud et al, 1991; Ljung, 2008; Nilsson et al, 1992; Fransen van de Putte, 2012), and 
hemophilia patients with HIC have a high rate of comorbid hypertension (Zanon et al, 2012). 
High blood pressure, in turn, is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease 
(Roger et al, 2011) as well as erectile dysfunction (Feldman et al, 1994).  
Viral infections 
Most PWH who have been treated with coagulation factor concentrates prior to the 
introduction of viral inactivation in 1985 are likely to have been infected with HIV and/or 
HCV. All PWH with HIV are generally now on antiretroviral therapy, which is highly 
effective in suppressing viral replication, so essentially HIV is a chronic disease. HIV patients 
are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and risk factor control should always be 
addressed (Shah et al, 2018).  
An increasing number of adults with Hemophilia and HCV have in recent years been treated 
with oral direct acting agent (DAA) treatments for HCV eradication, replacing historical use 
of interferon (Walsh et al, 2020). Two studies conducted by the American Thrombosis and 
Hemostasis network (ATHN-5 and ATHN-6) studied 226 patients to evaluate HCV outcomes

after eradication, including with DAAs. This represents the largest collection of patients with 
bleeding disorders infected by HCV and shows a similar distribution of HCV genotypes in 
people with bleeding disorders, compared to the population of people with HCV infection 
who were exposed to potential infection via other risks factors such as the use of illicit 
intravenous drugs, chronic dialysis, unprotected sexual contact, or being incarcerated. Over 
97% of participants in ATHN 5 demonstrated sustained response at 12 weeks after the end of 
DAA therapy, a reliable indicator of cure, and less than 1% of participants in ATHN 6 
discontinued DAA therapy early due to adverse reactions. (Walsh et al, 2020).  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is by far the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer, 
representing 90% of liver cancers worldwide (D'Souza et al, 2020). HCC development has 
been strongly linked to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV infections and is associated with 
approximately 80% of HCC cases (El-Serag, 2012). Most cases of HCV-related and 
HBV-related HCC occur among patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, with the 5-year 
cumulative risk of developing HCC for cirrhotic patients ranging between 5 and 30% 
(El-Serag, 2012). However, HCC occurs in up to 20% of patients with a non-cirrhotic liver 
(Desai et al, 2019; Trevisani et al, 2010).  
Osteoporosis and fracture risk:  
Worldwide, osteoporosis is associated with more than 8.9 million fractures each year 
(Johnell and Kanis, 2006). As reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey, the prevalence of osteoporosis in men is 5.7% among those over the age of 65 years 
(Looker and Frenk, 2015). In contrast, cross-sectional studies of men with hemophilia over 
the age of 50 years have reported the prevalence of osteoporosis to be significantly higher in 
all disease severities (44% severe, 25% moderate, and 39% mild) (Kempton et al, 2014). 
Meta-analyses of studies in both paediatric and adult populations have found consistently 
lower bone mineral density in PWH (Iorio et al, 2010; Paschou et al, 2014).  
Fracture is the main consequence of osteoporosis and can contribute to chronic pain and 
disability which is already a significant concern for PWH. Major osteoporotic fractures are 
those that occur in the hip, spine, forearm, or shoulder either spontaneously or from a fall at a 
standing height. These are considered fragility or low-trauma fractures. The exact risk of 
fracture in PWH and with low bone mineral density or osteoporosis is unclear. There are 
several reports that estimate that, when compared to the general population, PWH have a 
higher risk of fracture (Gay et al, 2015). In one study, the prevalence of hip or vertebral 
fracture in men aged 50 to 54 years was 16 to18% and significantly higher than estimates of

Part II:  Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
Preclinical studies were initiated with a gene therapy product employing a non-replicating 
recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 expressing the wild type of the human 
coagulation factor IX via a codon optimized transgene cassette (AAV5-hFIX; AMT-060; 
CSL220). Etranacogene dezaparvovec (AAV5-hFIXco-Padua; AMT-061; CSL222) was 
subsequently developed from AAV5-hFIX by introduction of a 2 nucleotide change in the 
transgene for human FIX, generating thereby the naturally occurring Padua variant of FIX 
(R338L), which exhibits significantly augmented activity.

•  Vector DNA integration into the host genome was 
studied in liver samples from the CSL220 GLP studies 
and indicated no potential carcinogenic risk of the 
product.  
The  safety  of  CSL220  and  CSL222  formulated  with  and

Not applicable as CSL220 and CSL222 are 
administered only once.  
The risk of any consequence due to insertional 
mutagenesis associated genotoxicity is considered 
negligible for CSL220 due to only marginal integration 
levels of the vector DNA into the host genome.  
These findings are considered applicable to CSL222 as 
well due to the nearly identical (2 nucleotide 
difference) vector DNA sequence.  
The observed marginal integration level and associated 
integration profile of CSL220 are deemed applicable 
CSL222 as well.  
Altogether the findings do not indicate a risk of 
CSL222 to contribute to malignant transformation and 
do not raise specific carcinogenicity concerns for use in 
humans.

activity levels were grossly supraphysiological 
(~2000% and 500% for CSL222 and CSL220, resp.) 
Microthrombi were not observed at lower doses and 
also were not detected in the NR-060-14-002 study that 
employed an even higher max dose of CSL220 
(2.3x1014gc/kg).  
Repeated-dose toxicity:  
•  Repeated dose toxicity studies were not performed as 
CSL220 and CSL222 will be administered only once. 
In view of this intended clinical administration, no 
repeated dose toxicity studies were required as per the 
2018 Guideline on the quality, non-clinical and clinical 
aspects of gene therapy medicinal products 
(EMA/CAT/80183/2014).  
Genotoxicity (mutagenicity):  
• 
In line with the 2018 Guideline on the quality, non-
clinical and clinical aspects of gene therapy medicinal 
products (EMA/CAT/80183/2014) standard 
genotoxicity studies, as applied to a conventional 
chemical drug, were not performed.  
•  Vector DNA integration site analysis performed on the 
host genome of liver samples from the CSL220 GLP 
study (NR-060-14-007) indicated no potential 
carcinogenic risk. (See Single dose toxicity studies 
section, above).  
Carcinogenicity:  
•  Linear - amplification mediated polymerase chain 
reaction (LAM-PCR) plus high throughput sequencing 
was conducted on DNA extracted from the livers of 
both mouse and cynomolgus macaques after 
administration of CSL220 at various doses.  
•  Both episomal (concatemeric) and integrated forms of 
CSL220 DNA were retrieved but the sequences were 
present almost exclusively as non-integrated episomal 
forms.  
•  The retrieved integrants were randomly distributed 
throughout the host genome. No specific clustering was 
seen in cynomolgus macaque genome, while some 
level of clustering around active genes was seen in the 
mouse.  
•  There were no findings of in vivo clone selection in the 
animals.

Key Safety Findings (from non-clinical 
studies) 
GLP safety study in cynomolgus macaques 
(NR-060-14-010):  
A single dose GLP toxicity study with IV injection of 
CSL220 in male cynomolgus macaques was 
performed, with assessments performed across a 
26-week period.  
The objectives of this study were to determine the 
potential toxicity of a single infusion of four doses 
ranging from 5 × 1011 gc/kg to 9.3 × 1013 gc/kg of 
CSL220, to evaluate the potential reversibility of any 
findings over a 6-month period, and to provide data 
to support the use of CSL220 vector in humans. In 
addition, biodistribution of the vector DNA was 
determined in target and off-target tissues. The 
animals were between 31 and 42 months of age at the 
time of dosing.  
•  There were no unscheduled deaths and no 
clinical signs related to treatment with CSL220.  
•  Cardiology, biochemistry, immunological, and 
inflammatory marker parameters were all 
unaffected by treatment with CSL220.  
•  There were no macroscopic or microscopic 
tissue findings that could be attributed to the 
administration of CSL220; therefore, it was 
concluded that a single IV infusion of CSL220 at 
levels between 5 × 1011 gc/kg and 
9.3× 1013 gc/kg was well tolerated in the 
cynomolgus macaque.  
•  There was no evidence of any significant 
toxicological finding, and no target organ effects 
were observed.  
GLP study in cynomolgus macaques 
(NR-061-17-001):

Irritancy and Sensitization: 
Local tolerance at the injection site has been assessed 
as part of the GLP general toxicity studies.  
•  No injection site reactions were reported.  
Immunogenicity: 
GLP safety study in cynomolgous macaques 
(NR-061-17-001):  
An ascending dose study of CSL222 (5x1011, 5x1012, 
2.5x1013, 9x1013 gc/kg) was conducted in 
cynomolgus macaques, with a single comparator 
dose (5x1012 gc/kg) of CSL220 to bridge 
observations between the predecessor product 
CSL220 and CSL222.  
•  There were no mortalities nor severe clinical 
findings related to treatment.  
•  All animals treated with either CSL220 or 
CSL222 developed high titer antibodies against 
AAV5 capsid proteins post product infusion.  
•  Six non-human primates (NHP) from 4 different 
groups developed antibodies against human FIX, 
a finding that was attributed to cross species 
antigenicity of human versus NHP FIX.  
•  Animals displayed only mild (~2x control) and 
transient liver enzyme elevations in the first 
week post product infusion.  
•  At a comparable dose of 5x1012 gc/kg of either 
CSL220 or CSL222 similar levels of vector 
DNA in plasma, vector DNA biodistribution, 
transgene mRNA as well as protein expression 
was observed.  
•  Baseline corrected FIX activity of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec-infused NHPs was approximately 
6.5 times that of CSL220 treated NHP at equal 
dose, in line with expected results of the 
gain-of-function Padua variant of FIX utilized in 
CSL222 compared to the wild-type hFIX 
employed in CSL220.  
•  Due to the lack of observed adverse events 
(AEs) the NOAEL was set at the highest dose 
studied (9x1013 gc/kg).

GLP safety study in C57Bl/6 mice 
(NR-060-14-002):  
•  The only notable finding in this study was 
observed on Day 8, which was increased spleen 
weight in the highest dose group associated with 
a mild transient increase in the number and size 
of germinal centers in the spleen that had 
resolved by Day 28 of the study.  
•  These effects were also present to a lesser extent 
in animals receiving the highest dose in 
combination with prednisone at Day 8 
post-administration.  
•  This finding is considered a reaction to the 
injection of viral proteins and the subsequent 
immune reaction towards the capsid proteins as 
supported by its transient character.  
GLP safety study in cynomolgus macaques 
(NR-060-14-010):  
A single dose GLP toxicity study with IV injection of 
CSL220 in male cynomolgus macaques was

26-week period.  
•  Cardiology, biochemistry, immunological, and 
inflammatory marker parameters were all 
unaffected by treatment with CSL220.  
Teratogenicity and fetotoxicity: 
Small amounts of AAV vector DNA have been 
observed in previous non-clinical studies in blood, 
urine, saliva, nasal secretions, feces, and semen.  
• 
In a non-clinical paternal germline transmission 
study in mice (NR-060-14-001), no vector DNA 
transmission to the offspring occurred at a dose 
level 10 × the clinical dose.  
•  Specifically, while vector DNA was present in 
sperm, it was not detectable in the uterus and 
placenta of the females and in the offspring.  
•  There were no effects of treatment on maternal 
behavior, body weights, food consumption, 
mating performance, fertility indices, pregnancy 
performance, external fetal abnormalities, and 
fetal weights.

High percentages like the ones observed in non-
clinical studies are not expected in humans due to a 
lower administered dose. The proposed clinical dose 
of etranacogene dezaparvovec is only 25% of that 
used in the highest dose group of NHPs.  
Therefore, no concerns in relation to human safety 
were raised.

In summary, the pharmacology studies demonstrated a strong correlation between dose and 
human factor IX expression levels and confirmed the biological activity of the expressed 
human factor IX protein. The studies confirmed that both CSL220 (AAV5-hFIX) and 
CSL222 (AAV5-hFIXco-Padua) induce expression of functional human factor IX protein.  
Biodistribution studies in animals have shown the preferential distribution and persistence of 
the vector DNA in the liver, with broad distribution to other organs at a lower level, for 
CSL220 and CSL222. Due to the liver-specific promoter used, factor IX mRNA and protein 
expression was limited to the liver.  
The paternal germline transmission/reproduction study revealed no effect on reproduction 
upon CSL220 treatment.  
The comparable dosing of CSL222 and CSL220 in the NHP study also permitted quantitative 
assessment of the hFIX-Padua variant’s specific activity relative to the wild-type hFIX. 
Factor IX activity, at a dose of 5 × 1012 gc/kg, is approximately 6-times higher per unit 
protein expressed for CSL222 (Padua variant) as compared to CSL220 (wild type). At the 
higher dose of 2.5 × 1013 gc/kg (close to the dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg that is being administered 
in the clinical studies with CSL222), the factor IX activity:protein ratio (specific activity) was 
between 7 and 9. These results are similar to the increase in specific activity reported for the 
FIX-Padua protein compared with “wild-type” factor IX protein, in animal models 
(Crudele et al, 2015; Monahan et al, 2015).

The toxicity study in cynomolgus macaques with etranacogene dezaparvovec demonstrated 
that a single IV infusion in the dose range of 5 × 1011 gc/kg to 9 × 1013 gc/kg was well 
tolerated by cynomolgus macaques. Based on this study, the proposed 
no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for CSL222 is 9 × 1013 gc/kg, which is 4.5-times 
above the dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg, employed in the phase 3 clinical trial.  
The formulation bridging study in mice showed that biodistribution, factor IX expression, and

Part II:  Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure 
The clinical development program for etranacogene dezaparvovec comprises 4 studies:  
•  CSL220_1001 (CT-AMT-060-01): A phase 1/2, open-label, uncontrolled, single-dose, 
dose-ascending, multi-center trial investigating an adeno-associated viral vector 
containing a codon-optimized human factor IX gene (AAV5-hFIX) administered to adult 
patients with severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B.  
•  CSL220_1002 (CT-AMT-060-04): A phase 1/2b extension study assessing the long-term 
safety and efficacy of an adeno-associated viral vector containing a codon-optimized 
human factor IX gene (AAV5-hFIX) previously administered to adult patients with severe 
or moderately severe Hemophilia B during the CT-AMT-060-01 phase 1/2 study.  
•  CSL222_2001 (CT-AMT-061-01): A phase 2b, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, 
multi-center trial to confirm the Factor IX activity level of the serotype 5 
adeno-associated viral vector containing the Padua variant of a codon-optimized human 
factor IX gene (AAV5-hFIX-Padua) administered to adult subjects with severe or 
moderately severe Hemophilia B.  
•  CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02): A phase 3, open-label, single-dose, multi-center 
multinational trial investigating a serotype 5 adeno-associated viral vector containing the 
Padua variant of a codon-optimized human factor IX gene (AAV5-hFIX-Padua) 
administered to adult subjects with severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B.  
Taking into consideration the mechanism of action of etranacogene dezaparvovec (continued 
transgene expression), the duration of exposure is defined as the time on study from treatment 
date to the minimum of end-of-study visit date, early termination date, or data cutoff date. 
Person-months is the total number of months contributed to each exposure duration interval.  
A summary of clinical trial exposure to CSL220 and CSL222 for all 4 studies (cumulative 
exposure) in person time is presented in Table SIII-1. Overall exposure by age and gender is

Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial 
Given the rarity of the disease, the small Hemophilia B patient population and the even 
smaller sizes of the cohorts, extrapolation of data on captured adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events in order to provide a meaningful perspective on the nature and 
frequency of these incidents is of limited value.  
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions or adverse reactions with a long latency.

Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is not known to have attributes that make it a candidate for 
intentional overdose, abuse, or illegal use. Therefore, no potential for misuse for illegal 
purposes is anticipated.  
Specific risks of advanced therapy medicinal product 
Hemophilia B is caused by a partial or complete deficiency in the coagulation protein FIX 
and is currently treated by life-long IV injections of recombinant or plasma-derived FIX 
products. Etranacogene dezaparvovec is intended to be used as a one-time intravenous IV 
infusion in the treatment of Hemophilia B patients who currently use Factor IX prophylaxis 
therapy or have current or historical life-threatening hemorrhage or repeated, serious 
spontaneous bleeding episodes. Treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec is intended to 
result in stable expression of hFIX-Padua, a natural occurring gain-of function variant of wild 
type FIX, in the liver which is the main site of FIX synthesis.  
The etranacogene dezaparvovec vector genome is packaged within adeno-associated virus 5 
(AAV5) derived capsids. The vector genome of etranacogene dezaparvovec consists of a 
codon optimized Padua derivative of the human FIX (hFIX-Padua) gene under control of the 
liver-specific human LP1 promoter. Additionally, the expression cassette contains SV40 
intron and SV40 poly A sequences for optimal expression and is flanked by intact inverted 
terminal repeats from AAV2. Characteristics of etranacogene dezaparvovec which may cause 
adverse effects to patients and third parties are evaluated during the environmental risk 
assessment (ERA) and are summarized below.  
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is produced in expresSF+ insect cells with the help of a 
Baculovirus Expression Vector System. The potential risk posed by the used recombinant 
baculoviruses is negligible since baculoviruses have a limited host range and are not able to 
replicate in mammalian cells. In addition, the recombinant baculoviruses are removed from 
the drug substance and its absence is assured by release testing. As a consequence of the 
manufacturing platform, low levels of short baculovirus DNA and expresSF+ cell DNA 
fragments can be present, which, in theory, might lead to a limited expression of small 
peptides. Due to the size and origin of these fragments and the shedding profile of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec, the risk of this adverse effect to human health and the

CSL Behring 
Risk Management Plan 
Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
environment is considered negligible. This has been confirmed in previous applications of 
recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs), which did not reveal any harmful 
effects that could possibly be related to residual baculovirus or expresSF+ insect cell DNA 
impurities.  
In theory, unintended exposure of third parties, like health care professionals and close 
contacts, to etranacogene dezaparvovec might cause an immune response to the particles or 
expression of hFIX-Padua. The potential risk caused by an immune response to etranacogene 
dezaparvovec particles is considered negligible since it is highly unlikely that third parties 
will be exposed to and infected by infectious particles. Additionally, the consequence of this 
immune response will be similar to that of a wild type AAV and is considered negligible.  
The probability that unintended exposure to etranacogene dezaparvovec will result in 
expression of hFIX-Padua is considered extremely low. Although the expression of 
hFIX-Padua might, in theory, be able to dysregulate coagulation, the likelihood that this will 
occur is, in view of the applied dose and the extreme overexpression needed, considered 
negligible. Consequently, the risk of both potential adverse effects to human health are 
considered negligible.  
Etranacogene dezaparvovec lacks all virus protein encoding sequences, which makes 
etranacogene dezaparvovec replication deficient. Nonetheless, scenarios in which 
etranacogene dezaparvovec can replicate in vivo, or even revert to a replication competent 
AAV either during manufacturing or post-administration, are theoretically conceivable. The 
risk of possible generation of replication competent AAV during manufacturing is considered 
negligible due to the design of the manufacturing system and the fact that absence of 
replication competent AAV is assured by release testing. Post administration, replication of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec would require a simultaneous infection of one-and-the-same cell 
with etranacogene dezaparvovec, wild type AAV and a helper virus. The likelihood that these 
requirements are met is considered highly unlikely and in the case of complementation will 
lead to the new formation of replication deficient etranacogene dezaparvovec particles. 
Therefore, risk of complementation is considered negligible. The likelihood that also 
(non)homologous recombination events between etranacogene dezaparvovec and wild type 
AAV will occur is considered negligible. The risk of the generation of replication competent 
rAAV due to this (non) homologous recombination is considered negligible. In addition, 
etranacogene dezaparvovec might be, in theory, eligible for homologous recombination with 
a SV40-like virus. The potential risk posed by this recombination event is considered 
negligible as it is highly unlikely that SV40 sequences will be present in the patient and share

sufficient homology with etranacogene dezaparvovec and that the recombination will actually 
materialize and form infectious virus particles.  
Insertional mutagenesis is a generally recognized safety concern of vector-based gene 
therapies. In theory, random integration of rAAV DNA into the host genome might lead to 
insertional mutagenesis that in worst-case can contribute to the development of malignancy. 
The potential risk of random integration of etranacogene dezaparvovec in unintended subjects 
is considered negligible due to the fact that rAAVs remain mainly episomal and due to the 
fact that it is considered highly unlikely that unintended individuals will be exposed to 
infectious etranacogene dezaparvovec particles. In addition, non-clinical studies and data 
from the subject who experienced HCC (CSL222_3001 /CT-AMT-061-02; see 
Section SVII.3) did not reveal integration at sites that raised any concern with 
carcinogenicity.  
Paternal germline transmission studies in mice employing a dose 10 times that recommended 
for human Hemophilia B patients did not show any transmission of vector DNA to mated 
females or their offspring. Furthermore, a neutralizing humoral immune response directed 
against the AAV5 vector capsid will develop in all immune competent Hemophilia B patients. 
This immune response will penetrate into the seminal fluid compartment and render vector 
particles non-transmissible. All subjects in clinical trials of Hemgenix have developed such 
an immune response within 2-3 weeks post vector infusion. This immune response is long 
lasting and exceeds the period during which any shedding of vector DNA is observable in 
trial subjects. In conjunction with the recommended barrier contraception period of 1 year 
after vector infusion this renders any risk of inadvertent germline transmission negligible.  
In addition to potential adverse effects to (un)intended individuals, also the potential adverse 
effects are assessed that etranacogene dezaparvovec might pose to the environment. In this 
respect, the potential adverse effects related to the exposure of etranacogene dezaparvovec to 
animals and plants, the potential adverse effects on the dynamics of populations of species in 
the receiving environment and the genetic diversity of each of these populations, the potential 
adverse effects facilitating the dissemination of infectious diseases, the potential adverse 
effects compromising prophylactic or therapeutic medical or veterinary treatment and the 
potential adverse effects on the biogeochemistry are evaluated. The risk of these potential 
adverse effects related to the proposed release of etranacogene dezaparvovec to the 
environment are all assessed as negligible.  
Standard precautions to mitigate spillage and/or aerosol formation of the genetically modified 
organism will be applied during the preparation and administration of etranacogene

dezaparvovec. In view of the ERA outcome, no additional management measures are 
required.  
Taken together, no immediate and/or delayed effects on human health are expected for 
persons working with etranacogene dezaparvovec or coming into contact with or in the 
vicinity of the genetically modified organism as it is released. Likewise, no effects on the 
environment are to be expected. The likelihood that etranacogene dezaparvovec becomes 
persistent and invasive in natural habitats is considered negligible. The host range of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec will be limited just like that of wild-type AAV and etranacogene 
dezaparvovec has been rendered non replicating, which provide in addition selective 
disadvantage. In the unlikely event that infectious particles are shed, the chance of 
subsequent spread into the environment is therefore considered negligible. In conclusion, 
under the prerequisite of applying the ERA related inclusion criteria for risk mitigation, the 
overall risk of the marketing of etranacogene dezaparvovec to human health and the 
environment is considered negligible.

Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP 
SVII.1.1  Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP:  
1.  Known or potential risks that require no further characterization or are followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction 
reporting, and for which the routine risk minimization measures are sufficient for the safe 
use of the product:  
•  Nausea: Four ADRs were reported in the CSL222 (AMT-061) clinical studies, 
which were non serious and mild. They occurred 4 to 6 days after administration 
and lasted 4 to 6 days. Nausea is listed in Hemgenix summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC). Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to monitor this 
risk.  
•  Fatigue: Four ADRs were reported in the CSL222 (AMT-061) clinical studies, 
which were non serious and mild. They occurred on the day of administration to 
13 days later and lasted 3 to 72 days (duration was not reported for 1 of the 
events). Fatigue is listed in Hemgenix SmPC. Routine pharmacovigilance is 
sufficient to monitor this risk.  
•  Malaise: Two ADRs were reported in the CSL222 (AMT-061) clinical studies, 
which were non serious and mild. They occurred 2 to 10 days after administration 
and lasted 5 to 6 days. Malaise is listed in Hemgenix SmPC. Routine 
pharmacovigilance is sufficient to monitor this risk.  
•  Dizziness: Four ADRs were reported in the CSL222 (AMT-061) clinical studies, 
which were non-serious and either mild (n=3) or moderate (n=1). They occurred 
on day 1 to 8 after administration and lasted 1 to 5 days. Only for the moderate 
event, the administration was interrupted. Dizziness is listed in Hemgenix SmPC. 
Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to monitor this risk.

SVII.1.2  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP 
Important Identified Risk 1: Hepatotoxicity 
Risk-benefit impact:  
The most prevalent hypothesis for the underlying mechanism of hepatotoxicity is a cytotoxic 
T cell-mediated immune response against the vector capsid sequences displayed on 
vector-transduced hepatocytes with resultant loss of transduced cells and consequent 
constraint on transgene expression (Manno et al, 2006; Mingozzi et al, 2007; 
Arruda and Doshi, 2020).  
In the non-clinical study NR-061-17-001, liver enzymes were transiently, and mildly 
(~2x control) increased during first week after dosing with etranacogene dezaparvovec 
(AAV5-hFIXco-Padua) or AAV5-hFIX in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Review of data from the CSL222 (AMT-061) clinical program revealed that serum 
transaminase elevations occurred most often in the first 1 to 2 months following 
administration, with asymptomatic ALT elevation being the most common treatment related 
AE.  
Published results of clinical trials show that IV administration of a liver directed AAV vector 
may lead to transaminase elevations which in general respond promptly and normalize after 
administration of corticosteroids, or resolve without any treatment (Rangarajan et al, 2017; 
Nathwani et al, 2011; Nathwani et al, 2014 and Nathwani et al, 2018; George, 2017; 
Manno et al, 2006).  
Decreased FIX activity has been reported in the literature along with ALT elevation, 
following infusion of AAV vector and this may have an impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
the product. Asymptomatic transient elevation in transaminases that resolved without 
treatment was reported in a study investigating the single infusion of rAAV–human FIX 
vector to adult males with severe (< 1% FIX activity) Hemophilia B. These events were

CSL Behring

Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
accompanied by declining FIX levels (Manno et al, 2006). ALT elevations with reduced FIX 
levels were also observed in patients receiving a single IV infusion of a novel serotype 
8 pseudo-typed, self-complementary AAV (AAV8) vector expressing a codon-optimized FIX 
transgene. All patients received a tapering dose of prednisone, which resulted in the 
resolution of hepatocellular toxicity events and the preservation of transgenic FIX expression 
(Nathwani et al, 2014).  
Important Identified Risk 2: Infusion reactions (including hypersensitivity) 
Risk-benefit impact:  
In the clinical studies with etranacogene dezaparvovec, infusion-related reactions of mild to 
moderate severity have been observed in 7/57 subjects.  
From the scientific literature, so far limited side effects after intravenous infusion of 
AAV-based gene therapy have been reported, however mild infusion related complaints were 
reported (Leebeek and Miesbach, 2021).  
Based on the limited exposure data and the potential impact on the benefit-risk profile of 
Hemgenix in case only a partial infusion can be administered, infusion reactions including 
hypersensitivity were classified as an important identified risk.  
Important Potential Risk 1: Risk of malignancy in relation to vector integration in the 
DNA of body cells 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Regulatory guidelines on gene therapy recognize the need for long-term follow-up when 
vectors with the capacity of integration or latency are administered to patients. Chromosomal 
integration of vectors is considered to present a risk for malignant transformation of cells due 
to insertional mutagenesis and activation, inactivation, or alteration of host cell genes. 
Therefore, viral vectors mediating transfer of their genetic material into the cell nucleus are 
considered to have a high risk for delayed adverse reactions (CHMP, 2009).  
Although the rAAV genome remains mainly episomal in the nucleus of transduced cells, a 
low frequency of random integration has been reported (Smith, 2008). Random integration of 
rAAV DNA into the host genome might lead to insertional mutagenesis, which can, in worst 
case, contribute to malignant transformation. Analyses of the integration in the performed 
non- clinical studies, and the subject who developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the 
CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02) study did not reveal integration at sites that would raise

CSL Behring

Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
any concern with respect to carcinogenicity. Thus, while the likelihood of insertional 
mutagenesis contributing to the development of malignancy is considered very low, the 
potential consequence of such event would be severe. Of note: no malignancy linked to an 
rAAV based gene therapy has been seen in any of the more than 250 clinical trials of rAAV 
vectors thus far (Sabatino et al, 2022, White paper of the ASGCT Working group on AAV 
integration).  
One case of HCC was observed in the CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02) clinical study in an 
elderly subject with multiple risk factors (HCV, HBV, age > 50, alcohol use, family history of 
cancer). Comprehensive integration site analysis and whole genome sequencing of the tumor 
and adjacent liver by an independent laboratory revealed no evidence to support a 
relationship between treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec and the development of the 
tumor; mutations commonly associated with HCCs were found in the tumor with pre-
malignant changes seen in the adjacent tissue. Based upon established risk factors for HCC 
and the lack of a genetic association in the evaluation of this patient, the event was 
considered unlikely related to AAV5-based gene therapy.  
Important Potential Risk 2: Bleeding as a result of lack of efficacy due to immune-
mediated neutralization of the AAV-5 vector capsid 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the viral vector are thought to be able to 
preclude efficient liver transduction (Mingozzi and High, 2011) and hence significantly 
reduce efficacy (Falese et al, 2017; Li et al, 2012).  
Product failure due to immune-mediated neutralization of the AAV5 vector capsid could lead 
to a decrease in circulating FIX activity levels, exposing the patient to risk of breakthrough 
bleeds and subsequent sequelae.  
Twenty-four out of the 57 subjects included in the clinical development program of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec were positive for anti AAV5 NAbs (titer ≥ 1:7) at baseline. One 
subject with a screening NAb titer of 3212 did not respond to treatment with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. The second highest titer at baseline reported in the AMT-061 clinical 
development program was 678 in a subject that responded to the treatment.  
From literature, one study was identified, in which serum samples were taken from healthy 
volunteers in France in order to characterize the humoral immune response to the AAV 
capsid, including AAV5. The prevalence of anti-AAV5 total IgG antibody was 40%, which

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
was lower compared to anti-AAV1 (67%) and anti-AAV2 (72%). Additionally, neutralizing 
factor seroprevalence for AAV5 was low (3.2%) and all individuals who were seropositive for 
AAV5 presented low titers (1:20) (Boutin et al, 2010).  
Important Potential Risk 3: Thromboembolic events 
Risk-benefit impact:  
The plausible mechanism for thrombogenicity is a supraphysiologic factor IX expression 
with corresponding higher (than normal) factor IX activity. In addition, it is postulated that 
Hemophilia B patients are at reduced risk of thromboembolic events due to inborn deficiency 
in the clotting cascade. Alleviating symptoms of Hemophilia B by restoring Factor IX activity 
may counterweight the reduced potential risk of thromboembolism and set it to the level as 
observed in the general population with non-hemophilic Factor IX levels (Sood et al, 2018; 
Kamphuisen et al, 2014).  
In the literature an association between FIX activity, particularly increased levels of FIX, and 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) is described (Wang et al, 2020; Heikal et al, 2013; 
Lavigne et al, 2003; Weltermann et al, 2003).  
In CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02), 4 Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 
3 subjects were identified as potentially relating to a thromboembolic event and reported as 
Preferred Terms of Angina pectoris (2 events) and Peripheral arterial occlusive disease and 
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1 event, each). No thromboembolic events were identified in 
Study CSL222_2001 (CT-AMT-061-01). Three of the 4 TEAEs were assessed by the 
Investigator as not related to etranacogene dezaparvovec and 1 serious TEAE of TIA 
occurred 229 days after dosing with etranacogene dezaparvovec; the causality was unlikely 
related taking into consideration most likely alternative cause of pre-existing advanced 
cardiac and cerebrovascular disease.  
Endogenous FIX activity achieved clinically relevant levels in the majority (52/54) of 
subjects, with no subject showing supraphysiologic FIX activity, however, based on the 
limited exposure data and the potential impact on the benefit-risk profile of Hemgenix, 
thromboembolic events were classified as an important potential risk.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Important Potential Risk 4: Germline transmission 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Several (non)clinical studies, and scientific literature indicates that transduction competent 
rAAV particles are not present in semen following IV administration for longer than 4 days 
post infusion (Schuettrumpf et al, 2006; Fonck et al, 2022; Arruda et al, 2001; 
Favaro et al, 2009; Jakob et al, 2005; Nathwani et al, 2011). Vector DNA is only temporarily 
detectable in semen and mainly available in the seminal fluid instead of the cellular fraction 
of semen. Moreover, non-replicating rAAV vectors show a very low integration potential, 
minimizing the likelihood of stable transduction of germline cells. Additionally, and in line 
with the above constraints, no paternal germline transmission was observed in the performed 
nonclinical study (NR-060-14-001). Similarly, studies using other AAV serotype-based 
vectors have not shown germline transmission via the male line and maternal-fetal 
transmission (Salmon et al, 2014). Of note, it is recommended that patients use barrier 
contraception for 1 year following Hemgenix administration (Hemgenix SmPC). Therefore, 
the potential risk to human health of germ-line transmission of CSL222 (AMT-061) is 
considered negligible.  
Important Potential Risk 5: Transmission to third parties (horizontal transmission) 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Based on results of shedding and clearance tests in pre-clinical and clinical studies, it is 
assumed that quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-detectable etranacogene 
dezaparvovec DNA fragments may be present in patients’ body fluids and excreta for several 
weeks after administration. However, these fragments will not necessarily represent 
infectious vector particles.  
The scientific literature supports that the shedding is most likely fragmented vector DNA and 
that this does not equate transduction competent virus particles. No adverse event has been 
reported referring to “Transmission to third parties (horizontal transmission)” in the clinical 
studies with etranacogene dezaparvovec. The environmental risk assessment has outlined that 
infectious AAV particles are restricted to the plasma compartment and are cleared from the 
circulation during the first 3 days after vector administration (Favre, 2001). After this period, 
it is considered that all infectious particles have infected test-subject’s cells or have been 
rendered non-infectious through other mechanisms (e.g., degradation by test-subject effector 
mechanisms, development of an opsonizing inhibitory humoral immune response against 
AAV5 capsid).

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
The risk of infectious particles shedding and further transmission to of third parties remains 
theoretical.  
Important Potential Risk 6: Development of FIX inhibitors 
Risk-benefit impact:  
The formation of inhibitory antibodies against coagulation factors is a major complication of 
factor replacement therapy. No subjects developed inhibitors in the clinical development 
program of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Additionally, no FIX alloantibody inhibitor 
formation was seen in clinical trials reported in literature, where patients were exposed to 
human factor IX or human factor IX- Padua gene transfer and where the expressed levels of 
factor IX were measurable (Manno et al, 2003; Manno et al, 2006; Nathwani et al, 2011; 
Nathwani et al, 2014; Nathwani et al, 2018 and George, 2017). The risk of FIX inhibitor 
formation following gene the administration of Hemgenix remains theoretical.  
Missing information 1: Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Subjects with ALT > 2 times upper normal limit, AST > 2 times upper normal limit, total 
bilirubin > 2 times upper normal limit and ALP > 2 times upper normal limit were excluded 
from participation in clinical trials. Two subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 
seven subjects with mild hepatic impairment as per NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group 
classification were included in the CSL222_3001 (AMT-CT-061-02) study. The use of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, has not been 
evaluated. Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a liver-directed gene therapy and therefore patients 
with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment may experience more severe hepatic function 
AEs and potential negative effect on efficacy.  
Missing information 2: Long-term effect 
Risk-benefit impact:  
The need for long-term follow-up is communicated by regulatory guidelines, which recognize 
the potential risk of declining treatment efficacy over time (CHMP, 2009).  
Declined levels of FIX have been observed in clinical trial results published in the literature, 
likely due to the cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune response against the vector capsid

sequences displayed on hepatocytes (Manno et al, 2006; Mingozzi et al, 2007; 
Arruda and Doshi, 2020).  
The clinical evidence supporting the long-term effects of etranacogene dezaparvovec is 
limited to the 2 ongoing clinical studies (CSL222_2001/CT-AMT-061-01 [N=3] and 
CSL222_3001/CT-AMT-061-02 [N=54]) that will be completed after 5 years of post-infusion 
follow-up.  
The number of patients in etranacogene dezaparvovec clinical studies followed up for 
> 24 months is limited and long-term safety and durability of etranacogene dezaparvovec are 
not characterized.  
Missing information 3: Use in female patients 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Female patients constitute only a small proportion of Hemophilia B patients. The disease is 
extremely rare in women (approximately 5%) (WFH, 2020), however some women who 
carry the mutation are symptomatic and require treatment.  
Female patients were not included in the initial clinical trials. There is no clinical data 
regarding administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec to female subjects. It is not known 
whether this medicinal product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman 
or can affect reproductive capacity. Etranacogene dezaparvovec should not be used during 
pregnancy. It is unknown whether etranacogene dezaparvovec is excreted in human milk. A 
risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Hemgenix should not be used during breast 
feeding (Hemgenix SmPC).  
Considering the potential impact of the one-time non-reversible nature of the treatment and 
lack of information on the use in the female population, use of etranacogene dezaparvovec in 
female patients is considered missing information.

Details of important identified risks, important potential 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of important identified risks and important 
potential risks 
Important Identified Risk 1: Hepatotoxicity 
Potential mechanisms:  
The most plausible mechanism underlying the liver effects of etranacogene dezaparvovec is a 
cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune response against the vector capsid sequences displayed on 
hepatocytes with resultant loss of transduced cells and consequent constraint on transgene 
expression (Manno et al, 2006; Mingozzi et al, 2007; Arruda and Doshi, 2020). On the other 
hand, liver function abnormalities were also reported without a measurable immunological 
cytotoxic T-cell response in the peripheral blood, as determined by enzyme-linked 
immunospot assays. It should be noted though, that this assay is not well standardized and 
has several limitations (Leebeek and Miesbach, 2021).  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
In the majority mild and transient transaminitis events were observed in the preclinical 
studies and during the clinical development program of etranacogene dezaparvovec.  
Furthermore, liver function abnormalities have been reported in clinical trials results 
published in the literature and investigating IV administration of a liver directed AAV vector 
(Rangarajan et al, 2017; Nathwani et al, 2011; Nathawani et al, 2014; Nathawani et al, 2018; 
George, 2017; Manno et al, 2006).  
Characterization of the risk:  
Fourteen TEAEs of Alanine aminotransferase increased in 12 subjects were reported in the 
CSL222(AMT-061) clinical studies (2 events in CSL222_2001/CT-AMT-061-01 and 
12 events in CSL222_3001 /CT-AMT-061-02). Seven of these events were mild, 6 were 
moderate and 1 was severe. Nine subjects (experiencing 10 out of 14 events) were treated 
with steroids, including prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. The outcome was 
reported as recovered/resolved for 13 events and recovering/resolving for the remaining 
event. FIX activity was preserved within a clinically meaningful range in all the subjects.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Additionally, 9 TEAEs of Aspartate aminotransferase increased in 8 subjects were reported in 
the CSL222 clinical studies (1 subject in CSL222_2001/CT-AMT-061-01 and 8 in 
CSL222_3001/CT-AMT-061-02). Seven events were of mild intensity, and the remaining 
2 were moderate and severe, respectively. Eight out of 9 events were accompanied by events 
of Alanine aminotransferase increased (see above) and for the remaining transient event, a 
concomitant event of Blood creatine phosphokinase increased was reported and no other 
related events. The outcome was reported as recovered/resolved for 8 events and 
recovered/resolved with sequelae for the remaining event. Three events were not related, 
2 events were possibly related, and 4 events were related to the treatment.  
Lastly, 1 TEAE of Transaminases increased (ALT and AST elevation) was reported in the 
CSL222_2001/CT-AMT-061-01 study. The event was non-serious, of mild intensity and 
assessed as not related. No treatment was administered for this event and the outcome was 
reported as recovered/resolved.  
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Common causative/risk factors for hepatotoxicity include: 
•  Elderly patients are at increased risk of hepatic injury due to reduced blood flow to the 
liver 
•  Drug-drug interactions 
•  Alcohol abuse in patients with cirrhotic liver changes 
•  Concomitant use of hepatotoxic medications 
Preventability:  
To mitigate the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, transaminases should be closely monitored, 
e.g, once per week for 3 months after etranacogene dezaparvovec administration. A course of 
corticosteroid taper should be considered in the event of ALT increase to above the upper 
limit of normal or to double the patient’s baseline levels, along with human FIX activity 
examinations.  
Information on this safety concern is provided in the patient card, health care professional 
guide and patient guide (See Section V.2 and Annex 6).

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Given the multi-morbidity (incl. life-threatening complications) of the target population, this 
safety concern has a moderate impact on the benefit-risk balance in this indication.  
Public health impact:  
The impact on public health is expected to be negligible. Liver enzyme elevations can be 
managed by appropriate monitoring of liver function tests and implementation of 
corticosteroid taper.  
Important Identified Risk 2: Infusion reactions (including hypersensitivity) 
Potential mechanisms:  
Administration of AAV vectors will induce innate immune response, followed by adaptive 
immune responses leading to the development of neutralizing antibodies in all individuals, 
which will be present long-term (Leebeek and Miesbach, 2021). Subjects with pre-existing 
anti-AAV5 antibodies may be at greater risk for infusion-related reactions 
(Gorovits et al, 2021).  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions were observed the clinical studies with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec.  
In the scientific literature, a small number of infusion-related reactions after intravenous 
infusion of AAV5-based gene therapy has been reported. These events were successfully 
mitigated by slowing or pausing the infusion and administering medications such as 
antihistamines, antipyretics, or glucocorticoids (Ozelo et al, 2022).  
Characterization of the risk:  
In the CSL222 (AMT-061) clinical studies, 7/57 subjects (12.3%) experienced in total 
13 infusion-related reactions (all subjects were included in CSL222_3001/CT-AMT-061-02). 
The Preferred Terms reported included Infusion related reaction (2), Dizziness (2), 
Abdominal pain upper, Chest discomfort, Eye pruritus, Flushing, Headache, Hypersensitivity, 
Infusion site reaction, Pyrexia, Urticaria. All 13 events were non serious and either mild 
(n=9) or moderate (n=4). Most events (n=11) resolved on the same day.

In 3 out of 7 subjects, administration was temporarily interrupted and restarted at a slower 
infusion rate following treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. In 1 additional 
subject, administration was discontinued, and the subject received a partial dose (~10%).  
The rate of infusion related reactions was higher in patients with preexisting neutralizing 
anti-AAV5 antibodies at baseline (8,8%; 5/57 patients) compared to patients without (3,5%; 
2/57 patients). However, the small number of subjects is not sufficient to confirm such an 
association.  
Risk factors and risk groups:  
No specific risk factors are known. However, patients with high levels of preexisting 
neutralizing antibodies against AAV5 might be more likely to experience infusion reactions.  
Preventability:  
Etranacogene dezaparvovec should be administered in a setting where personnel and 
equipment are immediately available to treat infusion related reactions. The diluted product 
should be administered at a constant infusion rate of 500 mL/hour (8 mL/min).  
Patients should be closely monitored for infusion reactions throughout the infusion period 
and at least for 3 hours after end of infusion. The recommended infusion rate should be 
closely adhered to ensure patient tolerability. Suspicion of an infusion reaction requires 
slowing or stopping of the infusion. Based on clinical judgement, treatment with e.g., a 
corticosteroid or antihistamine may be considered for management of an infusion reaction 
(Hemgenix SmPC).  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
The infusion-related reactions in the clinical studies have all been of mild to moderate 
severity. Subjects with pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies may be at greater risk for 
infusion-related reactions emanating from AAV antibody-mediated immune complex 
formation and complement activation. However, the small number of subjects in the clinical 
studies and the limited information in scientific literature is not sufficient to prove such an 
association.

The impact on public health is considered negligible. The infusion can be temporarily 
interrupted and resumed at a slower infusion rate upon treatment with antihistamines and/or 
corticosteroids.  
Important Potential Risk 1: Risk of malignancy in relation to vector integration in the 
DNA of body cells 
Potential mechanisms:  
In contrast to wild type AAV, rAAV vector genomes do not undergo site-specific integration 
into the host genome and remain mainly as episomal structures within the nucleus of 
transduced cells. However, random integration events are observed with a low frequency of 
0.1 to 1% of all transduction events (Smith, 2008). Apart from the frequency of integration, 
the occurrence of insertional mutagenesis depends upon the site of integration. Exceptionally, 
insertional mutagenesis could conceivably contribute to the development of tumor formation.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
Chromosomal integration of vectors is considered to present a risk for malignant 
transformation of cells due to insertional mutagenesis and activation, inactivation, or 
alteration of host cell genes. Therefore, viral vectors mediating transfer of their genetic 
material into the cell nucleus present a risk for delayed adverse reactions (CHMP, 2009).  
One case of hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the CSL222 clinical development 
program in an elderly subject with multiple risk factors (HCV, HBV, age > 50, alcohol use, 
family history of cancer). The event was considered as unlikely related to the etranacogene 
dezaparvovec treatment upon review of detailed genetic and insertion site analysis.  
Characterization of the risk:  
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a non-replicating recombinant AAV5 vector that remains 
largely non-integrating upon transduction of target cells. Nonclinical and clinical studies 
showed a low level of random integration events and did not reveal integration at sites that 
raised any concern of carcinogenicity and thus is not expected to cause development of 
cancer.  
No undisputed model has been described to assess oncogenicity by insertional mutagenesis. 
rAAV mediated insertional mutagenesis was assessed using linear amplification

PCR (LAM-PCR) plus 454-pyrosequencing. This assay was performed in collaboration with 
the German Cancer Research Center using AAV1-lipoprotein lipase in mice and lipoprotein 
lipase deficiency-patients muscle tissue (Kaeppel et al, 2013) and with 
AAV5-porphobilinogen deaminase in nonhuman primate liver tissue (Pañeda et al, 2013). 
This assay has produced consistent results in animal models and in tissue of patients. In 
summary, integration site analyses of liver following IV administration of rAAV did show a 
measurable but low level of integration, but no signs for malignant transformation was seen.  
Similarly, liver tissue samples from the GLP toxicity studies with AAV5-hFIX, the 
predecessor of etranacogene dezaparvovec (AAV5-hFIXco-Padua), in mice and Cynomolgus 
macaques were used for integration analysis. The retrieved vector sequences were almost 
exclusively non-integrated episomal forms. In NHP, the low amount of retrieved integrants 
were randomly distributed throughout the host genome with no preferred integration in genes 
associated with mediation of malignant transformation. In mice, low amounts of integrants 
were retrieved with some integration site clustering in active genes such as Alb, Tc39c, 
Esp38, and Lrrc4c.  
Although not generally accepted as validated model, the performed analyses of integration by 
LAM-PCR technology did not give any indication of genotoxicity. Accordingly, the 
likelihood of oncogenicity by insertional mutagenesis is considered highly unlikely, although 
it cannot be excluded completely.  
In CSL222_3001/CT-AMT-061-02, 1 event of HCC was reported in a male elderly subject 
with multiple risk factors for HCC including hepatitis B and C, age > 50, alcohol use, fatty 
changes in the liver (steatosis), and family history of cancer. This was identified on a routine 
abdominal ultrasound performed ~1 year after dosing with etranacogene dezaparvovec. The 
subject underwent an exploratory laparotomy with resection of the smaller of 2 lesions in the 
liver. Results from a histological analysis of the lesion were consistent with HCC. Molecular 
and integration site analyses were performed on the HCC tissue from the liver lesion and 
adjacent liver tissue by an independent laboratory and reviewed by external experts. 
Integration site analysis by 3‘LTR shearing extension primer tag selection/ligation-mediated 
polymerase chain reaction (S-EPTS/LM-PCR) (Schmidt and Bajaj, 2001) indicated that 
< 0.03% of the cells in the HCC and HCC-adjacent tissues had an AAV integration and did 
not indicate a dominant IS in the HCC sample, as would be expected if the AAV vector had 
integrated and led to clonal expansion of the tumor cells. Whole genome sequencing of the 
HCC showed mutations in a variety of genes that have been previously associated with HCC. 
Whole genome sequencing of the HCC-adjacent sample revealed a premalignant genetic

signature similar to the HCC sample. This was also observed in ribonucleic acid sequencing 
data that showed a pattern of gene expression in the HCC-adjacent sample that is 
characteristic of a premalignant state rather than healthy liver tissue. Based on these results, it 
was concluded that the event was not a result of vector integration, and the event was 
assessed as unlikely related to etranacogene dezaparvovec administration.  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global public health problem due to the rising 
incidence and high mortality in both developing and developed countries. To mitigate this 
important worldwide health care challenge, it is critical to detect the cancer early. Early 
detection allows the application of curative treatments. The epidemiology and risk factors for 
HCC are well known and vary with geographic region. The prevention strategy of Hepatitis B 
vaccination results in a decline in Hepatitis B. The European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control reported a rate of 8.9 cases of hepatitis C per 100 000 population (excluding 3 
countries which only reported acute cases and 2 countries that reported no data). From 
2010-2019, the overall number of cases diagnosed and reported across the 23 EU/EEA 
Member States that reported data consistently over this time, excluding those who only 
reported acute cases, showed year-to-year fluctuations with no clear long term trend 
(ECDC, 2021; Dhanasekaran et al, 2012). New antiviral therapies and surveillance are 
available that can lead to improved outcomes by decreasing the likelihood of future HCC 
and/or diagnosing HCC earlier. Early diagnosis of HCC is critical since the clinical outcome 
depends to a large extent on the ability to identify this cancer early. Resection and 
transplantation remain the cornerstones of curative therapy for HCC but several advances in 
the treatment of unresectable HCC are beginning to expand the therapeutic armamentarium 
(Dhanasekaran et al, 2012).  
The prevalence of HCC among PWH A or B was reported in 5 articles and ranged from 
0.007% (Ghosh and Shetty, 2012) to 6.9% (Miesbach et al, 2009). The lowest prevalence 
estimates of 0.007% was based on a study using questionnaires to ascertain individuals’ HCC 
status, and only 1 out of 13,470 individuals included in the cohort reported HCC. The study 
with the largest prevalence estimates of 6.9% was based on a small cohort of 29 individuals 
with Hemophilia A, only 2 of which were found to have HCC. The second lowest prevalence 
estimate of 0.69% (Kessler et al, 2016) was based on a study of individuals with acquired 
hemophilia only, as opposed to congenital Hemophilia, where only 1 case of liver carcinoma 
was captured. If these studies are excluded, the prevalence of HCC among PWH A or B 
ranged between 0.79% (Thalappillil et al, 2019) to 1.7% (Fransen van der Putte, 2012). Two 
studies reported the cumulative incidence of HCC among PWH to be 1.6% (HuangYC, 2015)

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
and 1.12% (Biron-Andreani et al, 2014). Lastly, 1 study reported an HCC prevalence estimate 
of 0.74% among people with Hemophilia B specifically (Thalappillil et al, 2019).  
Five studies reported the prevalence or incidence of HCC among PWH A or B who were also 
infected with HCV or HBV. The prevalence of HCC among PWH and HCV was reported in 
3  studies and ranged from 2.1% (Thalappillil et al, 2019) to 4.6% (Khan et al, 2013), and the 
cumulative incidence reported in 2 studies ranged from 1.4% (Santagostino et al, 2003) to 
2.5% (Fransen van de Putte et al, 2014). One study reported a cumulative incidence of HCC 
of 0.36% (Santagostino et al, 2003) among PWH B specifically and HCV. Only 1 study 
reported the prevalence of HCC among PWH and HBV, which was estimated to be 1.3% 
(Thalappillil et al, 2019).  
Given this targeted literature review, the overall prevalence of HCC ranges from 0.79 to 1.7% 
in PWH. HCV and HBV are known risk factors for the risk of developing HCC. In patients 
with HCV infection, the prevalence of HCC ranges from 2.1 to 4.6% and only one study 
found the prevalence of HCC among individuals that had HBV (1.3%).  
Risk factors and risk groups:  
The following have been described as risk factors for the development of HCC 
(Llovet et al, 2021):  
• 
Infection with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C 
•  Chronic alcohol consumption 
•  Advanced fibrosis 
•  Cirrhosis 
•  Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), associated with diabetes mellitus, or obesity 
•  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
•  Advanced age 
•  Male gender 
Preventability:  
It is recommended that patients with preexisting risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(such as hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatitis C or B disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease) undergo regular liver ultrasound screenings and are regularly monitored

(eg, annually) for alpha fetoprotein elevations for at least 5 years following administration, 
especially those with preexisting risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (such as hepatic 
cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, Hepatitis C or B disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) 
(Hemgenix SmPC).  
Information on this safety concern is provided in the patient card, health care professional 
guide and patient guide (See Section V.2 and Annex 6).  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Although the rAAV vector genome mainly remains episomal in the nucleus of the transduced 
cells, a small fraction will randomly integrate in the host genome leading to the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis. In the worst case, insertional mutagenesis can contribute to the 
development of tumor formation and negatively affect the benefit risk balance of the product. 
Routine screening of patients with pre-existing risk factors for HCC will ensure the early 
identification and treatment of tumor formation.  
Public health impact:  
Negligible due to the rarity of Hemophilia B patients and HCC.  
Important Potential Risk 2: Bleeding as a result of lack of efficacy due to 
immune-mediated neutralization of the AAV-5 vector capsid 
Potential mechanisms:  
Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AAV are widely distributed in the general 
population (Leebeek and Miesbach, 2021). High levels of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies 
are thought to be able to preclude efficient liver transduction through an immune response 
(Leebeek and Miesbach, 2021; Mingozzi and High, 2011) and hence significantly reduce 
efficacy.  
Product failure due to immune-mediated neutralization of the AAV5 vector capsid could lead 
to a decrease in circulating FIX activity levels exposing the patient to risk of breakthrough 
bleeds and subsequent sequelae.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
The CSL222 clinical studies suggest that although AAV5 neutralizing antibodies were 
prevalent in humans, the absolute levels at which they were present may not have been

adequate to significantly impact the infused dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec in the 
majority of patients.  
All patients receiving Hemgenix will develop NAbs against AAV5 in the weeks after 
administration. However, by that time the vector DNA will have been delivered to the nucleus 
of the cell where it will direct transgene expression. As such, production of hFIX-Padua is not 
expected to be impacted by the generation of the anti-capsid humoral immune response.  
Characterization of the risk:  
In the CSL222 (AMT-061) studies, 24 out of 57 (45.6%) subjects were positive for NAbs to 
AAV5 (≥ limit of detection (LOD); titer=7). In CT-AMT-061-01, all 3 subjects were positive 
for NAbs to AAV5 at baseline and in CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02), baseline levels of 
NAbs to AAV5 were < LOD for 33 out of 54 (61.2%) subjects and ≥ LOD for 21 out of 
54 (38.8%) subjects.  
In the CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02) study, one subject with a baseline anti-AAV5 NAb 
titer of 3212 had no safety findings but did not demonstrate FIX expression following 
treatment and needed to continue FIX prophylactic treatment. The second highest titer at 
baseline reported in the CSL222 clinical development program was 678 in a subject that 
responded to the treatment. Additionally, all subjects with lower titers also responded to the 
treatment.  
Breakthrough bleeding particularly in the joints and muscles still occur in many patients on 
prophylaxis when FIX activity levels are low. As few as only one or two bleeding episodes in 
a single joint might potentially initiate the process of inflammation, leading to synovitis and 
chronic joint damage or hemophilic arthropathy (Dodd and Watts, 2012; 
Fischer and Hermans, 2013).  
Chronic debilitating joint disease results from recurrent bleeding into the joint, synovial 
membrane inflammation, hypertrophy, cartilage damage, joint instability, subsequent atrophy 
of the muscles supporting the joint, and, eventually, destructive arthritis. Chronic joint 
deformities that need to be managed by an orthopedic specialist may occur. Furthermore, 
joint replacement(s) may be needed.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
There is a lack of data in patients with neutralizing anti-AAV5 antibodies above 1:678. 
Therefore, these patients could be considered at higher risk, due to the limited clinical 
experience.  
Preventability:  
Before administration of Hemgenix, baseline testing for preexisting neutralizing anti-AAV-5 
antibody titer is required (Hemgenix SmPC). Potential events of bleeding will be closely 
monitored to better understand the association between baseline preexisting neutralizing 
anti-AAV-5 antibodies and bleeding events/lack of effect.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Product failure due to immune-mediated neutralization of the AAV5 vector capsid could lead 
to a decrease in circulating FIX activity levels and subsequent sequelae, such as bleeding 
events and need for FIX prophylaxis treatment.  
Public health impact:  
The impact on public health is considered negligible as patients can revert to prophylaxis 
therapy in case of insufficient FIX activity expressed by the transgene.  
Important Potential Risk 3: Thromboembolic events 
Potential mechanisms:  
The plausible mechanism for thrombogenicity is a supraphysiologic FIX expression with 
corresponding higher (than normal) FIX activity. It should be noted that FIX activity will be 
restored in Hemophilia B patients treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec. Therefore, these 
individuals will no longer be “protected” from thromboembolic events due to their 
hemophilic state, but instead have the similar risk of developing such events, compared to the 
general population.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
Thromboembolism (e.g., pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis) 
has occurred when using Factor IX-containing concentrate.

One event of pulmonary thrombi was observed in the pre-clinical studies of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. Additionally, in the clinical development program of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec, four events potentially relating to a thromboembolic episode were reported.  
Characterization of the risk:  
In the toxicology investigations of etranacogene dezaparvovec the microscopic evaluations 
revealed minimal pulmonary thrombi for one animal (out of 10) from each of the 
5 × 1013 gc/kg AAV5-hFIX-Padua + polysorbate 20 and 
5 × 1013 gc/kg AAV5-Hfix-polysorbate 20 treatment groups.  
In Study CSL222_3001(CT-AMT-061-02), 4 TEAEs in 3 elderly subjects were identified as 
potentially relating to a thromboembolic event and reported as Preferred Terms of Angina 
pectoris (2 events), Peripheral arterial occlusive disease and Transient ischemic attack (TIA) 
(1 event, each). No thromboembolic events were identified in Study CT-AMT-061-01. Three 
of the 4 TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as not related to etranacogene 
dezaparvovec and 1 serious TEAE of TIA occurred 229 days after dosing with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec; the causality was unlikely related taking into consideration most likely 
alternative cause of pre-existing advanced cardiac and cerebrovascular disease.  
The highest expression seen to date in clinical trials (124%) is within the normal range. 
Further, once patients have achieved FIX activity levels in the non-hemophilic range (>40%) 
and particularly when steady-state levels are within the middle of the normal range 
(50-200%), it will be unlikely that they receive any additional exogenous FIX administration. 
Of note, the Padua mutation is currently not associated with increased risk of thrombosis at 
factor IX activity levels within the normal range and has not been identified in populations of 
subjects with VTE. FIX activity of up to 551% have been reported in relatives of the original 
reported subject with thrombophilia (Simioni et al, 2009) without associated thrombosis.  
One of the patients with a high expression of FIX (>200 IU/dL) participating in the phase 
1 B-AMAZE study (using FLT180a, a AAVS3 capsid carrying a FIX variant with a gain of 
function mutation), developed a thrombotic occlusion of AV-fistula for which anticoagulant 
treatment was started (Chowdary et al, 2020).  
It has been suggested that heightened levels of FIX are associated with the increased risk of 
thromboembolic events (TEEs), including VTE, pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial 
embolism. After a semi-structured, qualitative review of the current literature, various 
conclusions about this potential association could be made. One case-control study

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
(Wang et al, 2020) found that among elderly patients (mean age 78.7 years) with VTE there 
was an increased risk of VTE in individuals with FIX levels in the highest quartile 
(>132 IU/dL) compared to FIX levels in the lowest quartile (<104 IU/dL), with an OR of 2.4 
(95% CI: 1.1, 5.2). Another retrospective study investigated the association between FIX and 
VTE (Heikal et al, 2013) among younger individuals under the age of 65 and found that 
26.3% of individuals with VTE had elevated FIX activity (upper limit of normal FIX activity 
defined as the 95th percentile of the values found in healthy controls), which was significantly 
greater compared to the reference group of healthy controls without VTE (OR=6.8; 
95% CI: 1.18, 39.07). Similar results were found in an analysis of 18 individuals 
(Lavigne et al, 2003) with the outcome of VTE who came from families in which high levels 
of coagulation factors were inherited as a genetic trait (FVIII, FIX, FIX). Of these 18 
individuals who experienced VTE (median age of 32 years), 13 individuals had elevated 
levels of coagulation factors. Compared to the reference group of family members without 
elevated factor levels, high levels of the three factors were associated with the occurrence of 
VTE (OR=41; 95% CI: 4.9-353). Finally, a prospective study followed 546 patients with a 
first episode of spontaneous VTE, to investigate the association between heightened FIX 
levels and recurrent VTE (Weltermann et al, 2003). In this cohort of individuals with a mean 
age of 48 years, 66 people out of 546 (12%) experienced a recurrent VTE, including deep 
vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE (44 had DVT only; 22 had PE (with or without DVT). 
Patients with recurrent VTE had higher levels of FIX compared to those without recurrent 
VTE (133 IU/dL vs. 123 IU/dL, respectively). And according to a time to event Kaplan-Meier 
analysis, patients with FIX levels ≥138 IU/dL had a higher risk of recurrence compared to 
those with FIX levels <138 IU/dL (p-value<0.001).  
On the other hand, one case-control study (Chougule et al, 2016) showed no difference in 
FIX levels comparing 101 individuals with VTE and 86 controls without VTE (OR=0.85, 
95% CI: 0.27, 2.65). Importantly, no studies in our semi-structured search investigated the 
association between FIX and TEEs specifically among individuals with Hemophilia B. We 
see from this literature search that the majority of studies demonstrated an association 
between FIX activity, particularly heightened levels of FIX, and VTE.

Venous thrombosis risks  
•  Pregnancy 
•  Hormone replacement therapy

Preventability:  
Because of the potential risk for thromboembolism with the use of Factor IX concentrates, 
patients receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec should be monitored to determine their stable 
Factor IX expression. Factor IX expression following the administration of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec can be monitored with either one stage activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT-based) or chromogenic Factor IX assays.

Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Given the multi-morbidity (incl. life-threatening complications) of the target population, this 
safety concern has a low impact on the benefit-risk balance in this indication.  
Public health impact:  
The impact on public health is expected to be low. Thrombogenicity can be managed by 
appropriate monitoring of Factor IX expression and its corresponding activity.  
Important Potential Risk 4: Germline transmission 
Potential mechanisms:  
Several (non)clinical studies, including studies from scientific literature indicated that 
infectious particles are not present in semen following IV administration for longer than 
4 days post infusion. Vector DNA is only temporarily present in semen, mainly in the seminal 
fluid instead of the cellular fraction of semen (Schuettrumpf et al, 2006; Favaro et al, 2009; 
Rangarajan et al, 2017; Fonck et al, 2022).  
Transduction-competent AAV particles are short-lived, even in cases of a prolonged positive 
shedding signal. AAV vector particles are removed and / or inactivated from bodily fluids 
either via fast receptor-mediated uptake of transduction competent AAV particles into organs 
(within hours, assessed via biodistribution studies), via excretion via urine, feces etc., or 
through the effective development of an anti AAV5 humoral immune response.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
The question whether recombinant AAV vector sequences may transduce male 
spermatogonial stem cells and generate vector DNA-positive mature sperm cells (i.e., vertical 
germline transmission) has been extensively investigated and reported in the scientific 
literature. Schuettrumpf et al, 2006, as well as Jakob et al, 2005; Favaro et al, 2009; 
Arruda et al, 2001 and Fonck et al, 2022 did not detect vector sequences in sperm derived 
from dozens of cumulative spermatogenesis cycles in mice or rabbits after infusion of 
recombinant AAV. This indicates that biodistribution to male gonadal tissues does not lead to 
production of sperm carrying vector DNA. Together with the aforementioned absence of a 
vector signal in reproductive tissue of females, this indicates an extremely low likelihood of 
inadvertent germ line transfer (horizontal or vertical) of etranacogene dezaparvovec in 
patients treated with CSL222.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
There is no risk of shedding of transduction competent vector particles via bodily fluids after 
more than a few days post infusion (Schuettrumpf et al, 2006; Favaro et al, 2009; 
Rangarajan et al, 2017; Fonck et al, 2022). Following cellular uptake of transduction 
competent virus particles in the immediate post-infusion period, remaining capsid bearing 
vector particles will be rendered transduction incompetent and removed via the development 
of an effective NAb response against the AAV5 capsid protein in bodily fluids. All subjects in 
the CSL222 clinical trials have developed such an immune response within 2-3 weeks post 
vector infusion. This immune response is long lasting and exceeds the period during which 
any shedding of vector DNA is observable in trial subjects. Therefore, there is no relevant 
exposure risk of transduction competent AAV Particles and thus there is no prolonged 
relevant exposure risk of transduction to contacts. Exposure risk to close contacts in the 
immediate post-infusion period is further mitigated by the recommendation for a 1-year use 
of barrier contraception following Hemgenix administration (as outlined in the Hemgenix 
SmPC).  
Based on the low level of vector DNA in semen, its presence in the seminal fluid instead of 
the cellular fraction of semen, the low integration potential of non-replicating rAAV vectors, 
and the recommendation of barrier contraception during the time when transduction 
competent particles are present in semen, the likelihood of horizontal germline transmission 
is considered negligible.  
Characterization of the risk:  
A GLP-compliant paternal germline transmission / reproduction performance study was 
conducted in mice with AAV5-hFIX (NR-060-14-001). The dose levels ranged from a low 
pharmacological effect level to a dose corresponding to 10 times the envisioned clinical dose, 
or the highest technically feasible dose, whichever was higher. This non-clinical study in 
male mice revealed no paternal germline transmission at a dose level of 10 × the proposed 
clinical vector dose. Fertility of male mice treated with AAV5-hFIX was not diminished. 
These studies did not raise concerns regarding impairment of male fertility as findings for 
AAV5-hFIX are considered equally relevant for etranacogene dezaparvovec.  
Vector DNA was present in the testis of mice and Cynomolgus macaques at terminal 
sacrifice, 3 or 6 months after IV administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec or AMT-060. 
Trace amounts of vector DNA were detected in semen of cynomolgus monkeys at 6 months 
after treatment with CSL220 (AMT-060). Clinical studies CSL220_1001 and CSL222_2001 
revealed vector DNA in the semen of the subjects up to a maximal 365 days after 
administration. In CSL222_3001 study, shedding negative was defined as the first of

3 consecutive measures with a result of either 0 or below the limit of detection. Clearance of 
vector DNA from semen was established in 33/54 subjects at Week 53 post-treatment. This 
proportion was still the same at Week 72 (Month 18). The fact that the proportion of subjects 
with that definition did not change between weeks 53 and 72 is due to the non-submission of 
further samples after the subjects returned the first, or second, below LOD sample. As 
indicated above, presence of a qPCR detectable shedding signal does not equate to 
transduction-competent vector particles in blood or semen.  
To further assess the likelihood of germline transmission, a study has been performed in mice 
to investigate whether, following IV administration, vector DNA could actually be 
transmitted to the offspring. CSL220 (AMT-060), the predecessor of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec was administered to adult male mice at a dose of 2.3 × 1014 gc/kg, i.e., 
approximately 10 times the recommended human dose. Subsequently, these males were 
paired with untreated females on Day 6 after treatment (corresponding to the expected 
highest levels of vector DNA in male gonadal tissue). Vector DNA was detected in all tissue 
types examined (epididymis, seminal vesicle, sperm, and testes) from the CSL220 
(AMT-060) treated males, but no vector DNA was detected in any of the tissue types 
examined (uterus, fetus, and placenta) from the untreated females that mated with the treated 
males. No indication of paternal germline transmission to the offspring was observed. 
Similarly, studies using other AAV serotype-based vectors have not shown germline 
transmission via the male line and maternal-fetal transmission (Salmon et al, 2014; 
Arruda et al, 2001; Jakob et al, 2005; Fonck et al, 2022). This is in line with the findings in an 
in-vivo study in rabbits, which indicated that the vector sequences are mainly present in the 
seminal fluid and not in the cellular fraction of the semen samples (Schuettrumpf et al, 2006; 
Favaro et al, 2009). Likewise, AAV sequences were not detected in the sperm cells of AAV 
positive semen samples of human subjects following administration of rAAV 
(Rangarajan et al, 2017). No evidence of vector DNA transmission from males treated with 
CSL220 (AMT-060) to reproductive tissues and fetuses of mated females was found in the 
preclinical germline transmission study.  
In Study CSL222_2001 (CT-AMT-061-01), 2/3 (66.7%) subjects attained the status of no 
longer shedding vector DNA. The earliest that subjects were considered to be no longer 
shedding vector DNA from semen was 26.1 weeks (range: 26.1 to 26.3 weeks) after 
etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment. A subject was considered to no longer be shedding 
vector DNA if they had a negative laboratory result for 3 or more consecutive timepoints.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
In Study CSL222_3001 (CT-AMT-061-02), clearance of vector DNA from semen, indicating 
the absence of shedding, was confirmed in 33/54 (61.1%) subjects in the post-CSL222 
(AMT-061) treatment period. The earliest that subjects were considered to no longer be 
shedding vector DNA from semen was 6 weeks post-CSL222 (AMT-061) treatment (1.9% of 
subjects [95% CI: 0.3, 12.4]). Median time to absence of shedding (submission of a 
3rd negative sample) was 48 weeks (95% CI: 38.6, NE). The proportion of subjects testing 
negative increased at a continuous rate until Week 53, at which time 61.1% of subjects 
(95% CI: 48.5, 74.0) reached absence of shedding from semen; the proportion was the same 
at Week 72 (Month 18). Of note, the Week 6 semen sample for one subject was analyzed 
outside of the testing stability period. This sample was positive for vector DNA and the 
subject continued to test positive through the 18-month post-treatment period. Upon sample 
accountability/traceability by Sponsor, it was identified that the sample was collected but 
inadvertently not analyzed. Sponsor approved the analysis of the sample and inclusion in the 
study analysis, with the result flagged as being outside of test stability period.  
As discussed above, presence of a qPCR detectable shedding signal is highly unlikely to 
equate to transduction-competent (infectious) vector particles in semen.  
Risk factors and risk groups:  
In theory, an immediate effect of germline transmission is the addition of a hFIX-Padua 
expression cassette to the genome of progeny. Whether this addition will actually lead to the 
expression of hFIX-Padua protein depends on whether the vector genome will integrate in the 
host genome of progeny. If the vector genome remains episomal, it most likely will be lost 
during the many cell divisions in the development of the fetus. However, in the hypothetical 
situation that the complete expression cassette will be integrated, the expression of 
hFIXco-Padua can potentially materialize. Based on experience in the nonclinical and clinical 
studies the severity of overexpression of hFIX-Padua protein is considered low.  
Women of childbearing potential and male patients, including vasectomized males, are 
defined as risk groups.  
Preventability:  
For 1 year after administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec, treated patients of reproductive 
potential and their female partners of childbearing potential must prevent or postpone 
pregnancy using barrier contraception method. Males treated with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec must not donate semen to minimize the risk of paternal germline transmission.

CSL Behring 
Risk Management Plan 
Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Additionally, etranacogene dezaparvovec is not recommended in women of childbearing 
potential (Hemgenix SmPC).  
Information on this safety concern is provided in the patient card, health care professional 
guide and patient guide (See Section V.2 and Annex 6).  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Several (non)clinical studies, including studies from scientific literature indicated that 
infectious particles are not present in semen following IV administration for more than 2-4 
days (Schuettrumpf et al, 2006; Fonck et al, 2022). Vector DNA is only temporarily present in 
semen and mainly available in the seminal fluid instead of the cellular fraction of semen 
(Rangarajan et al, 2017). Moreover, non-replicating rAAV vectors show a very low 
integration potential, minimizing the likelihood of stable transduction of germline cells. 
Additionally, and in line with the above constraints, no paternal germline transmission was 
observed in the performed nonclinical study. Similarly, studies using other AAV 
serotype-based vectors have not shown germline transmission via the male line and 
maternal-fetal transmission (Salmon et al, 2014).  
The use of barrier contraception is recommended for 1 year after administration in patients of 
reproductive potential and their female partners of childbearing potential (Hemgenix SmPC).  
Therefore, the impact on the benefit-risk balance is considered negligible.  
Public health impact:  
Based on the low level of vector DNA in semen, its presence in the seminal fluid instead of 
the cellular fraction of semen, the low integration potential of non-replicating rAAV vectors 
and the protection afforded by the recommendation for temporary barrier contraception, the 
likelihood of germline transmission is considered negligible, and thereby the risk of germline 
transmission to human health is considered negligible as well.  
Important Potential Risk 5: Transmission to third parties (horizontal transmission) 
Potential mechanisms:  
In the hypothetical situation that unintended exposure of third parties to infectious 
etranacogene dezaparvovec would take place within the immediate post-infusion period, an 
immune response to the particles, expression of hFIX-Padua, or occurrence of adverse events 
relating to this exposure could occur. The probability that such an unintended exposure will

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
lead to the mentioned outcomes is extremely low, as will be discussed in the following 
paragraphs.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
Shedding and clearance of AAV5-hFIX-Padua were evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical 
studies. In Studies CSL222_2001 and CSL222_3001, clearance of vector DNA from blood 
was confirmed in 2/3 and 25/54 subjects, respectively, at the earliest 17 and 31.1 weeks after 
administration. It is anticipated that qPCR-detectable etranacogene dezaparvovec DNA 
fragments will be present in body fluids and excreta for several weeks after administration. 
However, the detected vector DNA does not equate infectious vector particles. Apart from an 
infectious particle, it can also represent DNA from a degraded vector particle, a particle that 
has been taken up by a cell, or a cell that has been transduced by the vector (e.g., leukocytes 
or epithelial cells of the bladder). Furthermore, the development of anti-AAV5 neutralizing 
antibodies in the immediate post-infusion period, will render any remaining capsid-bearing 
vector particles in the patients’ blood and seminal compartments non-transmissible. This 
immune response is long lasting and exceeds the period during which any shedding of vector 
DNA is observable in trial subjects. Therefore, the presence of vector DNA in body fluids and 
secretions is not expected to have any impact on individuals potentially exposed.  
Characterization of the risk:  
In Study CSL222_3001/ CT-AMT-061-02, clearance of vector DNA from blood was 
confirmed in 25/54 (46.3%) subjects after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment. The earliest 
that subjects were considered to be no longer shedding vector DNA from blood was 17 weeks 
postdose (1.9% of subjects [95% CI: 0.3, 12.4]). The proportion of subjects testing negative 
increased at a continuous rate until Week 50, at which time 46.3% of subjects (95% CI: 34.1, 
60.4) reached absence of shedding from blood; the proportion was the same at Month 18.  
In Study CSL222_2001 CT-AMT-061-01, clearance of vector DNA from blood, indicating 
the absence of shedding, was determined for 2 subjects during the Post-treatment Period. The 
earliest that subjects were considered to be no longer shedding vector DNA from blood was 
31.1 weeks (range: 31.3 to 78.3 weeks) after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment. Mean 
time to absence of shedding was 54.71 weeks.  
Clearance of CSL220 (AMT-060) vector DNA was studied in samples of serum, saliva, urine, 
and feces from Cynomolgus macaques, that were collected at several time points after dosing. 
Clearance curves in saliva and urine mainly followed the clearance from the serum albeit

CSL Behring

with vector DNA concentrations being multiple logs lower. Levels of vector DNA in serum 
declined over the 26-week observation period. Saliva was cleared between weeks 8 and 
12 Vector DNA levels in urine were low and reached the LOD around week 8. Similarly, the 
clearance of etranacogene dezaparvovec vector DNA was analyzed in plasma and urine from 
Cynomolgus macaques. The clearance observed in both plasma and urine confirmed the 
earlier clearance profiles with the CSL220 (AMT-060) vector. For urine, etranacogene 
dezaparvovec vector DNA was not detectable 3 months after administration of the highest 
dose of 9 x 1013 gc/kg. It is noted that shedding was assessed using a highly sensitive 
qPCR-based method that detects vector DNA sequences including fragments which are not 
representative of the amount of infectious particles.  
Risk factors and risk groups:  
The following risk groups are identified for this hypothetical risk:  
•  Recipients of blood, organs, tissues, or cells originated from Hemgenix-treated 
individuals 
•  Close contacts of patients 
•  Laboratory staff handling patient’s samples that may contain (parts of) the vector 
Preventability:  
Laboratory staff will wear protective clothing and equipment according to the relevant 
guidelines.  
Patients treated with Hemgenix must not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for 
transplantation (Hemgenix SmPC). Information on this safety concern is provided in the 
patient card, health care professional guide and patient guide (See Section V.2 and Annex 6).  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
In the hypothetical situation that infectious particles will be shed, the concentration will be 
extremely low. Shedding of these particles may lead to exposure of third parties which 
theoretically may result in transmission of the vector DNA. However, as shedding of 
infectious vector particles is already considered unlikely, the likelihood of exposure to and 
infection of third parties is even further reduced. Of note, Patients treated with Hemgenix 
must not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation (Hemgenix SmPC).

Public health impact:

Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
The impact to public health is considered negligible, due to the unlikelihood of infectious 
vector particles’ shedding.  
Important Potential Risk 6: Development of FIX inhibitors 
Potential mechanisms:  
The formation of inhibitory antibodies against coagulation factors is a major complication of 
factor replacement therapy. Inhibitors form in approximately 3-5% of patients with 
Hemophilia B on FIX replacement therapy (Perrin et al, 2019). Although the incidence of 
inhibitors in Hemophilia B patients on FIX replacement therapy is low, most are “high titer” 
and frequently associated with the development of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions 
(Bon et al, 2015). To date, there has been no association between gene therapy in 
Hemophilia B patients and formation of FIX inhibitors.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
No subjects developed FIX inhibitors in the clinical development program of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec.  
Characterization of the risk:  
All 57 (100%) subjects in Studies CSL222_2001/CT-AMT-061-01 and 
CSL222_3001/CT-AMT-061-02 were negative at baseline (before administration) for FIX 
inhibitors and have remained negative up the DLP of this RMP.  
No factor IX alloantibody inhibitor formation was seen in clinical trials reported in literature, 
where patients were exposed to human factor IX or human factor IX-Padua gene transfer and 
where the expressed levels of factor IX were measurable (Manno et al, 2003; 
Manno et al, 2006; Nathwani et al, 2011; Nathwani et al, 2014; Nathwani et al, 2018 and 
George, 2017).  
Interestingly, data from canine and murine hemophilia models have suggested that 
AAV-derived gene therapy may provide immunological tolerance to FVIII/FIX 
(Batty and Lillicrap, 2019). Crudele et al, 2015 reported that AAV liver expression of 
FIX-Padua prevented and eradicated FIX inhibitors in Hemophilia B dogs and mice. They 
concluded that the safe immunological profile of FIX-Padua in the inhibitor-prone dogs 
would allow the inclusion of Hemophilia B patients with factor 9 gene null mutations in gene

therapy clinical trials. Null mutations of the factor 9 gene are a known risk factor for 
development of inhibitors (Collins et al, 2013).  
Risk factors and risk groups:  
History of FIX inhibitors and positive FIX inhibitor test at screening were exclusion criteria 
in the etranacogene dezaparvovec clinical development program. Subjects with at least 
150 EDs of treatment with FIX protein were included in the CSL222 clinical studies. 
Although the likelihood of FIX inhibitors development following administration of gene 
therapy is very low, patients with less than 150 EDs to FIX concentrates could be considered 
at higher risk, due to the limited clinical experience.  
Preventability:  
The use of Hemgenix is not indicated in patients with a history of Factor IX inhibitors. In 
case increased plasma Factor IX activity levels are not achieved, decrease, or bleeding is not 
controlled or returns, post-dose testing for Factor IX inhibitors is recommended along with 
Factor IX activity testing. (Hemgenix SmPC).  
Information on this safety concern is provided in the patient card, health care professional 
guide and patient guide (See Section V.2 and Annex 6).  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
In the hypothetical scenario of FIX inhibitors formation, a patient would be at risk of gene 
therapy lack of effect and consequently spontaneous bleedings, as well as a risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions. However, as discussed above, there is no known relationship 
between Hemophilia B gene therapy and development of FIX inhibitors.  
Public health impact:  
The impact to public health is considered negligible, due to the very low risk of developing 
FIX inhibitors.

SVII.3.2  Presentation of the missing information 
Missing information 1: Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Evidence source:  
Population in need of further characterization:  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
Patients with known medical condition that may impact the intended transduction of the 
vector and/or expression and activity of the protein (ie., advanced liver disease including 
cirrhosis or liver fibrosis (suggestive of or equal to METAVIR Stage 3 disease, eg., a 
FibroScan™ score of  ≥ 9 kPa is considered equivalent) and patients with ALT > 2 times 
upper normal limit, AST > 2 times upper normal limit, total bilirubin > 2 times upper normal 
limit and ALP > 2 times upper normal limit), were excluded from participation in clinical 
trials. However, two patients with moderate hepatic impairment and seven patients with mild 
hepatic impairment were included in the HOPE B trial without indication of particular safety 
or efficacy issues. Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a liver-directed gene therapy and therefore 
patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment may experience more severe hepatic 
function AEs and potential negative effect on efficacy.  
Missing information 2: Long-term effect 
Evidence source:  
The need for long-term follow-up is communicated by regulatory guidelines, which recognize 
the potential risk of declining treatment efficacy over time (CHMP, 2009).  
Published results of a study in severe Hemophilia B patients using a single IV administration 
of a self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vector containing a codon-
optimized FIX gene, under control of a synthetic liver specific promoter and pseudo typed 
with serotype 8 capsid, (scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco), reported stable therapeutic expression of 
FIX over a period of 8 years (Nathwani et al, 2018).  
Published results of a decline in FVIII levels was reported in a 4-year follow-up of 
valoctocogene roxaparvovec phase 1/2 clinical study for severe Hemophilia A, although all 
patients remained off-prophylaxis (Ozelo et al, 2020). Results from Study CT-AMT-060-01 
using a single IV administration of AMT-060, wild-type hFIX and a predecessor to 
etranacogene showed stable FIX activity up to 5 years post dose.

CSL Behring 
Risk Management Plan 
Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Declined levels of FIX have been observed in clinical trials results published in the literature, 
likely due to the cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune response against the vector capsid 
sequences displayed on hepatocytes which in turn results in the loss of transduced cells and 
consequent constraint on transgene expression (Manno et al, 2006; Mingozzi et al, 2007; 
Arruda and Doshi, 2020).  
The durability of efficacy and the potential reduction in FIX expression overtime need to be 
monitored. It is currently unknown whether FIX activity will decrease overtime.  
Vectors with the capacity for integration require long-term clinical follow-up considerations 
because they persist for the lifespan of target cells or tissues. Delayed AEs should therefore 
be closely, including, but not limited to, carcinogenicity due to vector integration and 
auto-immunity caused by antibodies interfering with the activity of FIX and cross-reacting 
with the endogenous FIX (CHMP, 2009).  
The number of patients in HEMGENIX clinical studies followed up for >18 months is limited 
and the safety of HEMGENIX beyond this duration is not known.  
In order to better understand the safety and efficacy of long-term use of HEMGENIX, 
patients from phase 2b and phase 3 studies will be enrolled in a 10-year long-term follow-up 
extension study (CSL222_3003) to collect safety and efficacy data for a total of 10 years.  
Additionally, patients treated with HEMGENIX (within the first 5 years of 
commercialization) will be followed up for a minimum of 15 years in the post authorization 
efficacy and safety study CSL222_4001.

Rationale and study objectives: 
This interventional long term follow-up extension study will follow adult male patients with 
severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤ 2%) who previously received an 
infusion of AAV5 hFIXco-Padua (etranacogene dezaparvovec) in the parent studies, 
CSL222_2001 and CSL222_3001 with the aim to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec (6 to 15 years from the time of initial dosing).  
The primary objective will be to assess the long-term safety in adult male patients with 
Hemophilia B who were treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec in Study CSL222_2001 or 
CSL222_3001.  
The secondary objective will be to investigate the long-term efficacy profile in adult male

Survey to evaluate the effectiveness of additional risk minimization measures (aRMMs) for 
Hemgenix among prescribers in the EU.  
Rationale and study objectives:  
CSL Behring will develop and disseminate aRMM in the form of a Guide for HCP, 
Patient/Caregiver Guide and a Patient Card to address the important identified risk of 
hepatotoxicity and the important potential risks of thromboembolic events, germline 
transmission, risk of malignancy in relation to vector integration in the DNA of body cells 
and long-term effect as per the Risk Management Plan (RMP). This study is being designed 
to evaluate the effectiveness of such aRMM tools.  
Study objectives:  
1.  Assess HCP’s awareness of the aRMM tools by estimating the proportion of targeted 
HCPs who acknowledge receiving the tools.  
2.  Assess HCP’s utilization of the aRMM tools by estimating the proportion of targeted 
HCPs who acknowledge reading and utilizing the tools.  
3.  Assess HCP’s knowledge and behaviour pertaining to the key risk messages detailed in 
the aRMM by estimating the proportion of targeted HCPs with correct responses to 
knowledge and behaviour questions pertaining to the key risk messages.  
Study design:  
The effectiveness evaluation study will consist of a cross-sectional survey among prescribers 
of Hemgenix. The survey will be conducted in a sample of EU countries representing the 
highest volume of Hemgenix use across the EU. The actual countries will be determined upon 
approval of the product and will be communicated to the Agency for alignment prior to 
conducting the study. Currently it is anticipated that the countries will include Germany, 
Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden. Additional countries may be included to 
enhance recruitment. Potential Hemgenix prescribers will be invited to participate, and the 
survey will include screening questions to identify HCPs who have prescribed Hemgenix and 
who have not. Data will be collected using a structured, self-administered questionnaire. 
HCPs will be invited to take the survey online.  
Study Population:  
Potential Hemgenix prescribers in the specified countries in the EU.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity:  
The additional risk minimization activities will educate HCPs and patients about specific 
risks associated with the therapy and will provide guidance on monitoring these 
post-treatment.  
Target audience and planned distribution path:  
Target audience: HCPs and patients (via HCPs and patient organizations) 
•  Hemophilia Treatment Centers planning to be part of gene therapy administration patient 
journey (as administration or follow-up center, depending on the care delivery model 
decided by health authorities in EU member states.  
•  Potential Hemophilia B patients entering the gene therapy journey – via Hemophilia main 
patient organizations in EU member states, as well as European Hemophilia Consortium 
(European umbrella patient organization).  
Planned communication plan:  
•  Training of Hemophilia Treatment Centers by CSL Behring Medical Affairs teams on 
RMP/RMM/aRMM, during the onboarding process of the center for gene therapy 
•  Dissemination of HCP and patient training materials and patient cards to Hemophilia 
Treatment centers planning to be part of gene therapy patient journey 
•  Dissemination of patient training materials and patient cards to Hemophilia main patient 
organizations in EU member states, as well as European Hemophilia Consortium 
(European umbrella patient organization) 
•  Dissemination of HCP and patient training materials and patient cards via CSL Behring 
Hemgenix appropriate websites in EU / member states 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:  
To evaluate the effectiveness, CSL Behring is planning to perform a Survey to evaluate the 
effectiveness of aRMMs for Hemgenix among prescribers in the EU, with the objective of 
assessing HCP’s awareness of aRMM tools, HCP’s utilization of aRMM tools, HCPs 
knowledge of the risk of key adverse events highlighted in the Hemgenix SmPC and 
assessing the alignment of HCP’s self-reported behavior/practices of minimizing the risks of 
key adverse events in accordance with the SmPC.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
The effectiveness evaluation study will consist of a cross-sectional survey among potential 
prescribers of Hemgenix. The survey will be conducted in a sample of EU countries 
representing the highest volume of Hemgenix use across the EU. Additional countries may be 
included to enhance recruitment. Data will be collected using a structured, self-administered 
questionnaire. HCPs will be invited to take the survey online. However, other participation 
modalities (e.g., telephone, paper-based) may be made available to enhance participation. 
The survey will be administered 12 months after commercial launch of Hemgenix in the 
target country to allow sufficient outreach and utilization of the aRMM.

Part VI:  Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for HEMGENIX (etranacogene dezaparvovec) 
This is a summary of the RMP for HEMGENIX®. The RMP details important risks of 
HEMGENIX, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about HEMGENIX 's risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
HEMGENIX’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to HCPs and patients 
on how HEMGENIX should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for HEMGENIX should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
HEMGENIX’s RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for
HEMGENIX is authorized for the treatment of severe and moderately severe Hemophilia B 
(congenital Factor IX deficiency) in adult patients without a history of Factor IX inhibitors. It 
contains etranacogene dezaparvovec as the active substance and it is administered as a single 
intravenous infusion.  
Further information about the evaluation of HEMGENIX’s benefits can be found in 
HEMGENIX’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/hemgenix 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further
characterize the risks
Important risks of HEMGENIX, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about HEMGENIX’s risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs.
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly.  
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment - so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of HEMGENIX is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.  
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of HEMGENIX are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of HEMGENIX. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In the majority mild and transient transaminitis events were observed in the 
preclinical studies and during the clinical development program of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec.  
Furthermore, liver function abnormalities have been reported in clinical 
trials results published in the literature and investigating IV administration 
of a liver directed AAV vector (Rangarajan et al, 2017; Nathwani et al, 
2011; Nathwani et al, 2014; Nathwani et al, 2018; George, 2017; 
Manno et al, 2006).  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Common causative/risk factors for hepatotoxicity include:  
•  Elderly patients are at increased risk of hepatic injury due to reduced

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions were observed the clinical 
studies with etranacogene dezaparvovec.  
In the scientific literature, a small number of infusion-related reactions after 
intravenous infusion of AAV5-based gene therapy has been reported. These 
events were successfully mitigated by slowing or pausing the infusion and 
administering medications such as antihistamines, antipyretics or 
glycocorticoids (Ozelo et al, 2022).  
No specific risk factors are known. However, patients with high levels of 
preexisting neutralizing antibodies against AAV5 might be more likely to 
experience infusion reactions.

Important potential risk: Risk of malignancy in relation to vector integration in the DNA of body cells 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Chromosomal integration of vectors is considered to present a risk for 
malignant transformation of cells due to insertional mutagenesis and 
activation, inactivation or alteration of host cell genes. Therefore, viral 
vectors mediating transfer of their genetic material into the cell nucleus 
present a risk can have a high risk for delayed adverse reactions 
(CHMP, 2009). 
One case of hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the etranacogene 
dezaparvovec clinical development program in an elderly subject with 
multiple risk factors (HCV, HBV, age > 50, alcohol use, family history of 
cancer). The event was considered as unlikely related to the etranacogene 
dezaparvovec treatment upon review of detailed genetic and insertion site 
analysis.

Important potential risk: Bleeding as a result of lack of efficacy due to immune-mediated neutralization 
of the AAV-5 vector capsid 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The etranacogene dezaparvovec clinical studies suggest that although AAV5 
neutralizing antibodies were prevalent in humans, the absolute levels at 
which they were present may not have been adequate to significantly impact 
the infused dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec in the majority of patients.  
All patients receiving Hemgenix will develop NAbs against AAV5 in the 
weeks after administration. However, by that time the vector DNA will have 
been delivered to the nucleus of the cell where it will direct transgene 
expression. As such, production of hFIX-Padua is not expected to be 
impacted by the generation of the anti-capsid humoral immune response.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
There is a lack of data in patients with neutralizing anti-AAV5 antibodies 
above 1:678. Therefore, these patients could be considered at higher risk, 
due to the limited clinical experience.

Evidence for linking the risk to

Thromboembolism (e.g., pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, and 
arterial thrombosis) has occurred when using Factor IX-containing 
concentrate.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
One event of pulmonary thrombi was observed in the pre-clinical studies of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. Additionally, in the clinical development 
program of etranacogene dezaparvovec, four events potentially relating to a 
thromboembolic episode were reported.

Important potential risk: Germline transmission 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The question whether recombinant AAV vector sequences may transduce 
male spermatogonial stem cells and generate vector DNA-positive mature 
sperm cells (i.e., vertical germline transmission) has been extensively 
investigated and reported in the scientific literature. 
Schuettrumpf et al, 2006, as well as Jakob et al, 2005; Favaro et al, 2009; 
Arruda et al, 2001 and Fonck et al, 2022 did not detect vector sequences in 
sperm derived from dozens of cumulative spermatogenesis cycles in mice or 
rabbits after infusion of recombinant AAV. This indicates that 
biodistribution to male gonadal tissues does not lead to production of sperm 
carrying vector DNA. Together with the aforementioned absence of a vector 
signal in reproductive tissue of females, this indicates an extremely low 
likelihood of inadvertent germ line transfer (horizontal or vertical) of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec in patients treated with CSL222.  
There is no risk of shedding of transduction competent vector particles via 
bodily fluids after more than a few days post infusion (Schuettrumpf, 2006; 
Favaro et al, 2009; Rangarajan et al, 2017; Fonck et al, 2022). Following 
cellular uptake of transduction competent virus particles in the immediate 
post-infusion period, remaining capsid bearing vector particles will be 
rendered transduction incompetent and removed via the development of an 
effective NAb response against the AAV5 capsid protein in bodily fluids 
(within days). All subjects in the CSL222 clinical trials have developed such 
an immune response within 2-3 weeks post vector infusion. This immune 
response is long lasting and exceeds the period during which any shedding 
of vector DNA is observable in trial subjects. Therefore, there is no relevant 
exposure risk of transduction competent AAV Particles and thus there is no 
prolonged relevant exposure risk of transduction to contacts. Exposure risk 
to close contacts in the immediate post-infusion period is further mitigated

by the recommendation for a 1-year use of barrier contraception following 
Hemgenix administration as outlined in the Hemgenix SmPC.  
Based on the low level of vector DNA in semen, its presence in the seminal 
fluid instead of the cellular fraction of semen, the low integration potential 
of non-replicating rAAV vectors, and the recommendation of barrier 
contraception during the time when transduction competent particles are 
present in semen, the likelihood of horizontal germline transmission is 
considered negligible.  
In theory, an immediate effect of germline transmission is the addition of a 
hFIX-Padua expression cassette to the genome of progeny. Whether this 
addition will actually lead to the expression of hFIX-Padua protein depends 
on whether the vector genome will integrate in the host genome of progeny. 
If the vector genome remains episomal, it most likely will be lost during the 
many cell divisions in the development of the fetus. However, in the 
hypothetical situation that the complete expression cassette will be 
integrated, the expression of hFIXco-Padua can potentially materialize. 
Based on experience in the nonclinical and clinical studies the severity of 
overexpression of hFIX-Padua protein is considered low. However, the 
integration of part of the vector genome might also lead to insertional 
mutagenesis including its potential consequences.  
Women of childbearing potential and male patients, including vasectomized 
males, are defined as risk groups.

Shedding and clearance of AAV5-hFIX-Padua were evaluated in pre-clinical 
and clinical studies. In Studies CSL222_2001 and CSL222_3001, clearance 
of vector DNA from blood was confirmed in 2/3 and 25/54 subjects, 
respectively, at the earliest 17 and 31.1 weeks after administration. It is 
anticipated that quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-detectable 
etranacogene dezaparvovec DNA fragments will be present in body fluids 
and excreta for several weeks after administration. However, the detected 
vector DNA does not equate infectious vector particles. Apart from an 
infectious particle, it can also represent DNA from a degraded vector 
particle, a particle that has been taken up by a cell, or a cell that has been 
transduced by the vector (e.g., leukocytes or epithelial cells of the bladder). 
Furthermore, the development of anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibodies in the 
immediate post-infusion period, will render any remaining capsid-bearing 
vector particles in the patients’ blood and seminal compartments. This 
immune response is long lasting and exceeds the period during which any 
shedding of vector DNA is observable in trial subjects. Therefore, the 
presence of vector DNA in body fluids and secretions is not expected to 
have any impact on individuals potentially exposed.  
The following risk groups are identified for this hypothetical risk:  
•  Recipients of blood, organs, tissues, or cells originated from 
Hemgenix-treated individuals 
•  Close contacts of patients 
•  Laboratory staff handling patient’s samples that may contain (parts of)

History of FIX inhibitors and positive FIX inhibitor test at screening were 
exclusion criteria in the etranacogene dezaparvovec clinical development 
program. Subjects with at least 150 EDs of treatment with FIX protein were 
included in the CSL222 clinical studies. Although the likelihood of FIX 
inhibitors development following administration of gene therapy is very low, 
patients with less than 150 EDs to FIX concentrates could be considered at 
higher risk, due to the limited clinical experience.

Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization 
The following studies are a condition of the marketing authorization:  
CSL222_4001: An observational post-authorization Long-term Follow-up Study to 
Characterize the Safety and Effectiveness of HEMGENIX (Etranacogene 
Dezaparvovec) in Patients with Hemophilia B 
Purpose of the study:  
The purpose of this observational Study CSL222_4001 is to evaluate the long-term 
effectiveness and safety of HEMGENIX in a larger population of adult patients with 
Hemophilia B treated as per the approved HEMGENIX label in regions where HEMGENIX 
is approved for use and commercialized. The study will include a cohort of patients with 
Hemophilia B treated with continuous FIX prophylaxis to enable interpretation of relevant 
safety findings in patients with Hemophilia B.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
CSL222_2001: A phase 2b, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multi-center trial to 
confirm the Factor IX activity level of the serotype 5 adeno-associated viral vector 
containing the Padua variant of a codon-optimized human factor IX gene (AAV5 hFIX 
Padua) administered to adult subjects with severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B 
Purpose of the study:  
The primary aim of this trial is to confirm that a single dose of 2 x 1013 gc/kg etranacogene 
dezaparvovec will result in factor IX activity levels of ≥5%. An objective of the trial is to 
assess whether observed factor IX activity levels are within an expected range, to determine 
if 2 x 1013 gc/kg AMT-061 is suitable from efficacy point of view for administration in the 
pivotal Phase 3 trial. In addition, the safety profile of etranacogene dezaparvovec will be 
demonstrated.  
CSL222_3001: A phase 3, open-label, single-dose, multi-center multinational trial 
investigating a serotype 5 adeno-associated viral vector containing the Padua variant of 
a codon-optimized human factor IX gene (AAV5-hFIX-Padua) administered to adult 
subjects with severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B 
Purpose of the study:  
The purpose of this Phase III trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec in terms of annualized bleeding rate, to further describe its efficacy in terms of 
endogenous factor IX activity, and to further describe its safety profile.

CSL222_3003: An Extension Study Assessing the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of 
Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Previously Administered to Adult Male Patients with 
Hemophilia B during the CSL222_2001 (CT AMT-061-01) and CSL222_3001 
(CT AMT-061-02) Studies. 
Purpose of the study:  
This interventional long term follow-up extension study will follow adult male patients with 
severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤ 2%) who previously received an 
infusion of AAV5 hFIXco-Padua (etranacogene dezaparvovec) in the parent studies, 
CSL222_2001 and CSL222_3001 with the aim to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec (6 to 15 years from the time of initial dosing).  
CSL222_5001: Survey to evaluate the effectiveness of additional risk minimisation 
measures (aRMMs) for Hemgenix among prescribers in the EU 
Purpose of the study:  
CSL Behring will develop and disseminate aRMM in the form of a Guide for HCP, 
Patient/Caregiver Guide and a Patient Card to address the important identified risk of 
hepatotoxicity and the important potential risks of thromboembolic events, germline 
transmission, risk of malignancy in relation to vector integration in the DNA of body cells 
and long-term effect as per the RMP.  
CSL Behring will perform this survey in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such aRMM 
tools.

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
Annex 6 
Details of proposed additional risk minimization activities 
Prior to launch of Hemgenix in each Member State, the marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational program with the National 
Competent Authorities. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Hemgenix is marketed, all 
healthcare professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, use or oversee the 
administration of Hemgenix have access to/are provided with the following educational 
packages. These packages will be translated in the local language to ensure understanding of 
proposed mitigation measures by physicians and patients: 
• Physician Educational Material
• Patient Information Pack.
The Physician Educational Material consists of: 
• Guide for Healthcare Professionals;
• The Summary of Product Characteristics;
• The Patient/Care-giver guide;
• The Patient Card.
The Patient Information Pack consists of: 
• The Patient/Care-giver guide;
• The Patient Card;
• The patient information leaflet.

Risk Management Plan 
Version 1.0 
HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
The Guide for Healthcare Professionals key messages: 
• To inform the patient of the important identified risk of hepatotoxicity and the
important potential risks of horizontal and germline transmission, development of
Factor IX inhibitors, malignancy in relation to vector genome integration, and
thromboembolism, and details on how these risks can be minimised.
• Before a treatment decision is made, the healthcare professional should discuss the
risks, benefits, and uncertainties of Hemgenix with the patient when presenting
Hemgenix as a treatment option, including:
- That Hemgenix use will require in some cases administration of corticosteroids to
manage the liver damage that this medicinal product might induce. This requires
adequate monitoring of patients’ liver function and avoidance of concomitant use
of hepatotoxic medication or agents, to minimise the risk of hepatoxicity and a
potential reduced therapeutic effect of Hemgenix.
- That high preexisting neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies may reduce the efficacy of
Hemgenix therapy; patients should be assessed for the titre of preexisting
neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies before Hemgenix treatment.
- That there is a possibility of not responding to treatment with Hemgenix. Patients
who do not respond are still exposed to long‑term risks.
- That the long‑term treatment effect cannot be predicted.
- That there would be no plans to re‑administer the medicinal product for patients
who do not respond or have lost the response.
- That the patients should be tested for Factor IX inhibitors to monitor development
of Factor IX inhibitors.
- Reminding patients about the importance to enroll in a registry for follow up of
long‑term effects.
- The healthcare professional should provide the patient guide and patient card to the
patient

HEMGENIX / etranacogene dezaparvovec 
The Patient/Care-giver guide key messages: 
•
Importance to fully understand the benefits and risks of Hemgenix treatment, what is
known and not yet known about the long‑term effects, related to both safety and efficacy.
• Therefore, before a decision is made about starting on the therapy the doctor will discuss
with the patient the following:
- That Hemgenix will, in some cases, require treatment with corticosteroids to
overcome the liver damage that this medicine may produce, and that the doctor
will ensure that patients are available for regular blood tests to check response to
Hemgenix and assess liver health. Patients should inform the healthcare
professional about current use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. If
the patient cannot take corticosteroids, the doctor may recommend alternative
medicines to manage problems with the liver.
- That high preexisting immunity against the vector may reduce the efficacy of
Hemgenix therapy; patients are expected to be assessed for the titre of preexisting
neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies before the Hemgenix treatment.
- That not all patients may benefit from treatment with Hemgenix. Patients not
responding to treatment are still be exposed to long‑term risks.
- Details how the important potential risks of horizontal and germline transmission,
development of Factor IX inhibitors, malignancy in relation to vector genome
integration, and thromboembolism can be recognised and minimised by regular
monitoring as recommended by doctors, including that:
- The patient should seek immediate medical advice for any symptoms suggestive of
a thromboembolic event.
- Male patients of reproductive potential or their female partners should use barrier
contraception for one year after administration of Hemgenix.
- That Hemgenix has a viral vector component, and it may be associated with an
increased risk of malignant tumour. Regular liver monitoring for at least 5 years

after Hemgenix treatment is needed in patients with preexisting risk factors for 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
-
Patients should not donate blood, semen, or organs, tissues, and cells for
transplantation
- That the patient will get a patient card that should be shown to any doctor or a
nurse whenever the patient has a medical appointment.
- The importance to participate in the patients’ registry for long‑term surveillance of
15 years.

The Patient Card key messages: 
• This card is to inform healthcare professionals that the patient has received Hemgenix for
hemophilia B
• The patient should show the patient card to a doctor or a nurse whenever they have an
appointment
• The patient should seek medical advice for any symptoms suggestive of a
thromboembolic event
• The patient should have regular blood tests and examinations as directed by their doctor
• The card should warn healthcare professionals that the patient may undergo treatment
with corticosteroids for minimising the risk of hepatotoxicity with Hemgenix.

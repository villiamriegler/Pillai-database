1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Takeda Pharma A/S submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 11 March 2015 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested: 
Variation requested

Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include the treatment of adult patients with Hodgkin Lymphona (HL) at 
increased risk of relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and the 
RMP (v.6.3) are updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Adcetris was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/08/595 and EU/3/08/596 on 15 January 
2009 in the indications systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and HL, respectively.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the second of the above 
mentioned orphan designations. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0263/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0263/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products, because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
The applicant requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation 
(EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication (see separate assessment report on 
this request).

Protocol assistance 
The applicant sought Protocol assistance at the CHMP on April 2009. The scientific advice working party 
(SAWP) gave advice on the proposed target indication, the primary endpoint PFS, the assessment criteria, 
and the placebo + best supportive care control arm, that were all acceptable. However, the SAWP 
indicated that PFS data should be supplemented by OS data even if the trial is not specifically powered for 
the OS endpoint. Alternatively, PFS at a fixed time point (about 3 years, at plateau phase) may be of 
interest.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
HL accounts for approximately 10 percent of all lymphomas. The incidence in Europe is approximately 2.4 
cases per 100.000 persons. Young adults aged 20–40 years are most often affected; a second incidence 
peak is seen in individuals aged 55 and older. HL is characterized histologically by malignant Hodgkin and 
Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells that are surrounded by non-malignant inflammatory cells. HL is divided in two 
major subtypes: classical (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLPHL), based on 
immunohistological features and microscopic appearance of the malignant cells. The NLPHL subtype 
makes up 5% of all HL and has a generally more indolent course than cHL. Most, but not all NLPHL, are 
CD30 negative, whereas CD30 expression is a standard feature of HRS cells in cHL. Clinical symptoms are 
present in 2/3 of patients, and could include the presence of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, 
unexplained weight loss >10% in 6 months), fatigue, pruritus and alcohol-induced pain. 
HL is highly curable, with 80% of patients reaching complete remission. Prognosis is worse in patients 
who present with advanced disease, with 30-40% relapse after initial treatment or immediate treatment 
failure. Staging is according to the Ann Arbor criteria, which are based on localisation, the extent of nodal 
and extranodal involvement and the presence of the classical B symptoms. 
After diagnosis of HL, different chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens are recommended, depending 
on the stage of the disease. According to the ESMO Clinical Practice guidelines1, the following therapeutic 
algorithm can be used (Figure 1).

Hodgkin’s lymphoma; IFRT, involved-field RT. 
For most patients with refractory or relapsed HL after frontline therapy, the treatment of choice consists 
of high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT.
Salvage regimens, such as dexamethasone/ high-dose Ara-
C/ cisplatin (DHAP), ifosfamide/gemcitabine/vinorelbine (IGEV) or ifosfamide/ carboplatin/etoposide 
(ICE), are given to reduce the tumour burden and mobilize stem cells (often in combination with G-CSF) 
before high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT.  
ASCT can provide a cure for approximately 50% of patients who are eligible for transplantation based on 
disease status and ability to tolerate the treatment. The 5-year event free survival (EFS) rates for 
patients with low-risk disease range from 65% to 80%, whereas the 5-year PFS rate for patients 
identified by different prognostic indexes as approximately 25% to 40% for moderate risk and 10% to 
20% for high risk patients. Relapse or progression after ASCT generally occurs early; approximately 71% 
of progression events occurs within 1 year post-ASCT and 90% within 2 years post ASCT. 
No established system of risk factors systematically guides clinicians to identify patients at risk of relapse 
or progression post-ASCT. It is accepted that multiple risk factors should be considered, including risk 
factors prior to ASCT. Risk factors repeatedly associated with a strong prognostic value include: 
-  History of HL refractory to frontline therapy or a short time to first relapse, 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Presence of extranodal disease pre-ASCT, 
Lack of chemo-responsiveness to pre-ASCT salvage therapy, 
Presence of residual disease at the time of ASCT, 
Presence of B symptoms at pre-ASCT relapse, 
-  Multiple relapses before ASCT, 
     and, more recently, 
- 
FDG-PET positive disease pre-ASCT.

Most patients with relapsed or refractory HL who are not cured by ASCT will eventually die of their 
lymphoma. Historical outcomes for the approximately 50% of patients experiencing progressive disease 
post-ASCT are extremely poor, with a median post-progression survival of 1.3 years, and a 5-year 
survival rate of 20% or less. This indicates a need for new therapies for patients with relapsed or 
refractory HL, which might include patients at risk of disease progression post-ASCT. The relatively short 
EFS or PFS with intermediate or high risk disease indicates that these patients have residual viable 
lymphoma cells that have been insufficiently eradicated by ASCT. Consolidation, maintenance, or 
adjuvant therapy following ASCT may be an attractive approach for patients at increased risk of relapse 
or progression.  
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), that consists of the chimeric 
anti-human CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) conjugated to the small molecule cytotoxic anti-tubulin 
agent MMAE by a protease-cleavable linker. Mechanistically, brentuximab vedotin acts by binding to the 
cell surface marker CD30, expressed on cells of several types of malignancy, including Hodgkin Lymhoma 
(HL). After binding to CD30 positive cells, brentuximab vedotin is internalized, and MMAE is released from 
the conjugate through proteolytic degradation of the drug linker. Released MMAE binds to the tubulin and 
leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death. CD30 expression on normal cells is rare (less than 1% of 
lymphoid cells), it’s expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells) and weakly 
on activated monocytes.  
The first marketing authorization for brentuximab vedotin in the EU was granted in October 2012. 
Brentuximab vedotin is currently approved for relapsed or refractory CD30+ HL following 1) autologous 
stem cell transplant (ASCT) or 2) following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent 
chemotherapy is not a treatment option. In addition, brentuximab vedotin is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 
Brentuximab vedotin is formulated for intravenous administration as a 50 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion. The recommended dose is 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 
30 minutes every 3 weeks.  
The efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin regarding the currently approved indication in HL has 
been established based on an open-label, single arm, phase II study including 102 patients with relapsed 
or refractory HL. The overall response rate (ORR: CR+PR) per Independent Review Facility (IRF) 
assessment was 75% with single agent brentuximab vedotin, and tumour reduction was achieved in 94% 
of patients. Complete remission (CR) was 33%, and median overall survival was 40.5 months. 
The use of brentuximab vedotin represents an option in patients relapsing after ASCT. Furthermore, 
reduced- intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-ASCT) can be considered in 
young, chemosensitive patients in good general condition who relapse after high-dose chemotherapy and 
ASCT. There are no approved therapies in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with HL at increased 
risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. The current standard of care is observation until disease 
progression or relapse. 
Pursuant to Article 8(3), Directive 2001/83/EC, Takeda Pharma A/S submitted a Type II (C.I.6.a) 
variation to the European Medicines Agency for the following extension of the indication: “ADCETRIS is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following 
ASCT (see section 5.1)”. The proposed posology is similar to already approved indications. 
The CHMP agreed to the following indication: 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of relapse or 
progression following ASCT (see section 5.1). 
Posology

For patients with HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT, ADCETRIS treatment 
should start following recovery from ASCT based on clinical judgment. These patients should receive up to 
16 cycles (see section 5.1).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Brentuximab vedotin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ HL 
or with relapsed or refractory sALCL. In this procedure the applicant is applying for the treatment of adult 
patients with HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. The recommended dose is 
1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks, which is the same 
dose regimen as for relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL. 
Pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin was not studied in the pivotal phase III study AETHERA. As the 
dosing regimen is identical and the intended target of CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma also comparable, no 
differences in pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin is expected. The incidence of anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) was investigated and is presented in the safety section of this report.

Treatments 
Patients were treated with brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) with best supportive care or placebo and best 
supportive care.  
Study treatment (brentuximab vedotin or placebo) was administered via outpatient IV infusion 1.8 mg/kg 
given over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Dose reductions to 1.2 mg/kg were 
allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity. Doses reduced for treatment-related toxicity 
could not be re-escalated. The start of the next cycle could be delayed for up to 3 weeks if additional time 
was required for the patient to recover from study treatment-associated toxicity experienced during the 
current cycle.  
Treatment duration and response assessment 
Patients could continue study treatment for a maximum of 16 cycles or until disease progression (PD) or 
unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred earlier. 
Lymphoma progression was assessed using the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. 
Computed tomography (CT) scans (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) were performed at screening/baseline 
and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months from the first dose of study treatment. 
Co-medication 
Required concomitant therapy: Prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and 
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) after ASCT; and PCP prophylaxis for all patients on this study.  
Prohibited concomitant therapy: Other anticancer treatment.

The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS per an independent review facility (IRF). PFS analysis was performed 
in the intend-to-treat (ITT) population, using the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. An 
adequate lymphoma progression assessment included diagnostic biopsy or radiographic assessment (CT 
of chest, abdomen and pelvis). 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is OS, based on the ITT population. 
Exploratory endpoints 
-  Quality of Life (QoL), as measured by Utility Instrument (EQ-5D) score 
-  MRU based on the number of medical care encounters 
Sample size 
Approximately 202 PFS events (progression or death due to any cause) were originally planned for the 
primary efficacy analysis to detect a hazard ratio of 0.667 (18 months median PFS for brentuximab 
vedotin and BSC versus 12 months for placebo and BSC) using the log-rank test with 80% power and an 
overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025. The assumed median PFS of the placebo and BSC group were 
based on long-term results of ASCT for primary refractory or relapsed HL2 .  
With protocol amendment 6, the timing of the primary efficacy analysis was changed to be performed 
when all scheduled study radiographic progression assessments were completed. Approximately 161 
events were projected at the time of the amendment, which would provide 73% power to detect an HR of 
0.667 using the log-rank test with an overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization was to be stratified by: 
-  Best clinical response per the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma obtained after 
the completion of salvage therapy prior to ASCT, as assessed by the investigator: 
o  Complete remission (CR) 
o  Partial remission (PR) 
o  Stable disease (SD) 
-  Refractory/relapsed status after the end of frontline standard chemotherapy or a combined 
modality treatment program: 
o  Any refractory HL 
o  Relapsed HL that occurs <12 months after the end of front-line standard chemotherapy 
therapy 
o  Relapsed HL that occurs ≥12 months after the end of front-line standard chemotherapy 
therapy 
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal study was double-blinded.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary population for efficacy analysis was the intent to treat (ITT) population, which included all 
randomised patients.  The per-protocol analysis set included all randomised patients who were 
randomised, received at least one dose of assigned treatment and did not have major protocol deviations. 
This analysis set was used for secondary analysis of efficacy endpoints. 
Analysis methods 
The primary statistical hypothesis can be expressed in terms of the hazard ratio λSGN-35 / λPlacebo where 
λSGN-35 represents the hazard of progression on the brentuximab vedotin arm (SGN-35) and λPlacebo 
represents the hazard of progression on the placebo arm. A hazard ratio < 1 indicates that the duration 
of PFS is prolonged for patients on the brentuximab vedotin arm compared with patients on the placebo 
arm. 
The null and alternative hypotheses can be written respectively as: 
H0 = λSGN-35 / λPlacebo ≥ 1 
HA = λSGN-35 / λPlacebo < 1 
The statistical hypotheses of OS are similar to that of PFS. 
Multiplicity 
A fixed sequential testing procedure was used to test between PFS and OS such that OS was tested only 
if the test of PFS was statistically significant. If the test for the primary analysis of PFS was statistically 
significant in favour of the brentuximab vedotin and BSC group at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025, a 
formal statistical test was performed for OS at an overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
Interim analysis  
One interim analysis of futility based on PFS was planned (101 events in the ITT analysis). Early stopping 
of the trial due to overwhelming efficacy was not planned. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 14/83 
 
  
  
An interim analysis of OS was performed at the time of the primary analysis of PFS with a fixed one-sided 
p-value of 0.008. This alpha level is based on an O’Brien-Fleming boundary with the estimated 
information expected to be available at the time of the interim analysis. The final analysis of OS will be 
tested at a one-sided 0.017 level, ensuring an overall one sided 0.025 alpha level. If the test for primary 
analysis of PFS would not have been statistically significant, the p-value of the test for OS would not have 
been calculated, but the point estimate for the hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be provided and considered descriptive. 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of disease progression (PD) by 
the independent review facility (IRF) or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first.  The primary 
analysis was based on the ITT analysis set using a stratified log-rank test at one-sided alpha level of 
0.025. In addition, a stratified Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and the 
corresponding 95% CI for the treatment effect. If the proportional hazard assumption with the Cox 
regression model was violated, a parametric survival analysis may have been performed. Kaplan-Meier 
plots were provided by treatment group. The median PFS and its two-sided 95% CI for the median and 3-
month intervals were calculated using the complementary log-log transformation method. Percentage of 
PFS at various time intervals (e.g., every 6 months) were also calculated using the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate. 
Secondary Analyses of PFS used the same censoring method for the primary PFS analysis: PFS per 
Investigator  on ITT; PFS per IRF – Unstratified Analysis;  PFS per Investigator – Unstratified Analysis;  
PFS per IRF – Per Protocol Analysis Set. 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS used alternative censoring methods, statistical tests and analysis sets: PFS per 
IRF – only censoring and events at scheduled visit dates based on ITT; PFS per Investigator – only 
censoring and events at scheduled visit dates based on ITT; PFS per Investigator – Including Investigator 
Claim of Progression as an event on ITT; PFS per IRF Based on EMA Guideline on the Evaluation of 
Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man, 2012, Appendix 1 (Methodological Considerations for Using 
Progression-free Survival or Disease-free Survival in Confirmatory Trials);  PFS per IRF – Subsequent 
New Antitumor Therapy Considered an Event on ITT; PFS per Investigator – Subsequent New Antitumor 
Therapy Considered an Event on ITT. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
If PD is not documented and the patient is alive at the time of the data cut off or study withdrawal, 
whichever occurred first, PFS was censored as described in Table 3.

Page 15/83 
 
  
  
Table 3: 
Primary PFS Analysis (includes documented progression only) 
PFS per IRF based on the ITT analysis set was also defined based on the European Medicines Agency 
guideline (EMA Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man, 2012, Appendix 1: 
Methodological Considerations for Using Progression-free Survival or Disease-free Survival in 
Confirmatory Trials). The censoring/event method is presented in Table 4.

The primary analysis of overall survival (OS) was based on the ITT analysis set. Overall survival was 
defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause. The primary analysis of OS 
was the stratified log-rank test using the randomised stratification factors. In addition, a stratified Cox 
regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% CI for the treatment 
effect. In the absence of confirmation of death, OS was censored at the last date the patient is known to 
be alive. 
Secondary analyses of OS: Unstratified analysis (unstratified log-rank test  and an un-stratified Cox 
regression model for the hazard ratio) and a PP analysis. 
Analysis adjusting for crossing-over: Patients who experience progressive disease on study were allowed 
to request unblinding and could have received subsequent therapy with brentuximab vedotin (on a clinical 
trial or commercial supply in regions where the drug is approved) or other therapies. This issue may 
potentially confound the overall survival analysis. To deal with this, a sensitivity analyses of OS using 
rank preserving structural failure time models (RPSFT) was conducted using unvalidated R software. 
Procedural controls will be in place for verification of the results. An exploratory analysis of OS using the 
Inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) method was conducted. 
Missing data handling 
Patients with missing values of a variable other than the time-to-event endpoints (PFS and OS via 
censoring rules) and QoL endpoints were excluded from the analysis or summary of that endpoint. 
Missing data is imputed for: 
•  Missing or partial dates of AE onset and end dates 
• 
Incomplete date of initiation of first new cancer-related therapy in long-term follow-up: the date was 
imputed to the last day of the month if only the day is missing, otherwise not. 
•  QoL analysis: EQ-5D TTO index scores was imputed at EOT and 3-month intervals through month 24 
for all patients who were either still on study at the expected time-point or off-study for reason of 
death. Visits for patients who were last known to be alive were imputed using last observation carried 
forward (LOCF), while visits for patients who had died within or prior to a one-week window of the 
expected visit date were imputed as zero. Visits where the EQ-5D was partially completed had the 
index score imputed as if the entire visit was missing.  
Post-hoc analyses: efficacy analyses by risk groups  
Numerous factors have been associated with increased risk status; of these, 3 were selected as AETHERA 
inclusion criteria on the basis of multiple literature reports available at the time the study was designed  
and their feasibility for collection in the study: 
•  History of refractory HL (defined as patients progressing on or failing to achieve a complete remission 
following frontline standard chemotherapy or a combined modality treatment program) 
•  Relapsed or progressive HL that occurs <12 months from the end of frontline standard chemotherapy 
or a combined modality treatment program 
• 
Extranodal involvement at the time of pre-ASCT relapse (including extranodal extension of nodal 
masses into adjacent vital organs) 
Patients eligible for AETHERA were to have had at least 1 of these conditions. A 5-factor analysis was 
explored and these inclusion criteria and other representative and important risk factors were assessed in 
the full study population:

Conduct of the study 
Study protocol amendments 
The original study protocol was dated 21 April 2009 and was subsequently amended 6 times. The major 
changes were as follows: 
Protocol amendment 1 (21 Oct 2009, 0 patients enrolled) 
-  Sample size increased to 322 patients to enable detection of a HR of 0.667. 
-  More frequent CT scanning and lymphoma assessments incorporated. 
- 
Investigator assessment of response to prior salvage therapy added as stratification factor. 
Protocol amendment 2 (16 Aug 2010, 17 patients enrolled) 
-  Administration of EQ-5D health questionnaire and MRU data added. 
-  Addition of recommendation that patients with Grade 2 neuropathy were to resume treatment at 
1.2 mg/kg. 
- 
Extension of follow up period for events of peripheral neuropathy and other AEs of interest 
beyond 30 day post-treatment. 
Protocol amendment 3 (3 Oct 2011, 186 patients enrolled) 
-  Clarification of eligibility criteria to exclude patients with PML. 
Protocol amendment 4 (29 Nov 2011, 206 patients enrolled)  
-  Revision safety section to a.o. better define subcategories of AEs.  
Protocol amendment 5 (7 Jun 2012, 290 patients enrolled) 
- 
The procedure for emergency unblinding was revised. 
Protocol amendment 6 (13 Dec 2013, 329 patients enrolled) 
- 
The timing of the primary efficacy analysis was changed to occur after all study scheduled CT 
scans had been performed. The sponsor considered it unlikely, after analysis of blinded pooled 
PFS data, that the originally planned 202 progression events would be observed in the study. At 
the time of amendment, all patients had been off therapy for at least one year. 
Protocol compliance 
Of the 329 patients randomised in the study, 69 (21%) had a protocol violation: 39 patients (24%) in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm and 30 (18%) in the placebo arm. The main reason for protocol violation in 
both arms was study conduct (9%) and drug administration (7%). Study conduct violations mainly were 
randomization stratification errors or missed radiographic assessments/visits, both at similar frequencies 
in the two arms. The majority of the study drug administration violations (17 of 23 patients) were 
because dose adjustments were not performed per protocol for weight changes greater than 10% from 
baseline or because of dose miscalculations by site staff. The remaining 6 patients who had study drug 
administration violations did not receive the correctly assigned study drug kits in one cycle (3 patients in 
each treatment arm).

Numbers analysed 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were based on the ITT analysis set, defined as all 329 
randomised patients (165 patients in the Brentuximab vedotin arm and 164 in the Placebo arm). 
Efficacy endpoints were also analysed using the per-protocol (PP) analysis set, which included 258 
patients; (126 patients brentuximab vedotin and 132 placebo). The PP population was comprised of all 
randomised patients receiving at least one dose of assigned treatment and without major protocol 
deviations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint - Progression free survival 
The PFS follow up from randomization approximately 22 months. The median PFS per IRF in the ITT 
population was 42.9 months (95% CI 30.4, 42.9) in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared with 24.1 
months (95% CI 11.5, -) with placebo, indicating a 18.8 month difference in favour of brentuximab 
vedotin. The difference between the two arms was statistically significant (p=0.001; stratified log rank 
test). The estimated 24-month PFS rate was 63% (brentuximab vedotin) vs 50% (placebo). As assessed 
by Cox regression analysis, the stratified hazard ratio was 0.57 (95% CI 0.4, 0.8; Figure 2).  
Figure 2: 
Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Progression-free Survival per IRF (ITT Population) 
September 2014 analysis - Study SGN35-005 
The number of patients censored for the primary analysis was higher in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
(64%) compared with the placebo arm (46%), mainly caused by a higher percentage of patients without 
documented progression, still on study in the brentuximab vedotin arm (56% vs 42% placebo). 
Since 2014, independent review reported 2 PFS events; investigators reported 5 PFS events. The PFS 
event velocity has slowed such that 95% of events detected as of October 2015 per investigator and 94% 
of events detected as of October 2015 per IRF occurred within the first 25 months (Figure 3).

Secondary analyses of PFS 
PFS per IRF – Per Protocol population 
The median PFS per IRF in the PP population was not met in the brentuximab vedotin arm (95% CI 30.4,-
) compared with 17.8 months (95% CI 6.5,-) with placebo. The stratified hazard ratio was 0.45 (0.30, 
0.68), supporting the primary PFS analysis per IRF in the ITT population. 
PFS per IRF using EMA censoring guidelines 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted using censoring rules defined in the EMA scientific guideline, which 
disregards missed visits or initiation of new anticancer treatment for the purposes of censoring. By this 
analysis, the median PFS per IRF was 39.9 months in the brentuximab vedotin arm, versus 24.1 months 
in the placebo arm. The stratified HR was 0.55 (95% CI 0.39, 0.77). 
PFS per investigator 
The median PFS per investigator in the ITT population was not met in the brentuximab vedotin arm (95% 
CI 26.4,-) compared with 15.8 months (95% CI 8.5, -) with placebo. The estimated 24-month PFS rate 
was 65% (brentuximab vedotin) vs 45% (placebo). As assessed by Cox regression analysis, the stratified 
hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.36, 0.70; Figure 5). Assessment of PD (yes/no) was discordant between 
IRF and investigator assessment for 11% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 15% in the placebo arm.

PFS per investigator including clinical lymphoma assessments 
The majority of patients had no radiographic assessments after the last protocol mandated CT scan at 24 
months and were therefore censored at this time for analysis of PFS per IRF. Although CT scans were not 
required after 24 months, clinical lymphoma assessments continued to be performed every 6 months by 
investigators for patients who had not yet progressed. A secondary PFS analysis was performed including 
these clinical lymphoma assessments for defining events of progression. By this analysis, the median PFS

for the brentuximab vedotin arm was not reached (95% CI -,-), compared with 15.8 months (95% CI 
8.5, -) in the placebo arm. The stratified HR was 0.5 (95% CI 0.36-0.70; Figure 6). 
Figure 6: 
PFS per Investigator Including Clinical Lymphoma Assessments - Study SGN35-
005 
Secondary endpoint - Overall survival 
At the time of analysis, the survival follow up was immature: the median OS was not reached for patients 
in either treatment arm.  
At the time of the PFS analysis an interim analysis of OS was performed, showing no difference between 
the treatment arms (HR 1.15 (95% CI 0.67, 1.97; p=0.620;Figure 7)). A total of 28 patients (17%) in 
the brentuximab vedotin arm and 25 patients (15%) in the placebo arm had died, and the estimated 24-
month OS rate was 88% (brentuximab vedotin) vs. 89% (placebo).

Exploratory endpoint - Quality of life 
Quality of life was measured using a preference-based patient reported instrument: European Quality of 
Life 5-Dimensional [EQ-5D]. 
Adherence rates for completion of the self-report questionnaire were generally high throughout the study 
and completion rates were similar between the 2 treatment arms at all stages of the trial.  
A small but progressive decline in TTO index scores in both treatment arms was observed from baseline 
to Month 24 (Figure 9) when death was inputed. When death is not imputed, TTO scores are stable over 
time (data not shown). Scores on the brentuximab vedotin treatment arm were slightly lower than those 
on the placebo arm from Months 9 to 18.  Mean differences in EQ-5D TTO index scores (US- and UK-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 26/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
value sets) generally did not exceed the minimally important difference (MID) between treatment arms, 
except for months 15 and 18.  
Figure 9: 
ITT US indexed mean (±95% CI) EQ-5D TTO scores - Study SGN35-005 
Disease progression was associated with lower mean scores at subsequent time points, often exceeding 
the MID in both treatment arms, and patients who experienced PD experienced lower mean scores versus 
patients who never experienced PD on study. Differences between treatment arms could not be localized 
to a single component of the EQ-5D descriptive system. Lower scores could not be explained by 
treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy on the brentuximab vedotin arm. When death is imputed, TTO 
scores decrease over time as well. The relationship between the TTO scores by treatment arm is similar, 
supporting the primary analysis results. 
EQ VAS scores did not show a significant difference between treatment arms (Figure 10).

Exploratory endpoint - Medical resource utilization  
The medical resource utilization (MRU) analysis as exploratory endpoint, was planned to be based on the 
number of medical care encounters in the ITT analysis set. The MRU data on outpatient visits, 
hospitalizations, and working days/other activities missed by patients and caregivers suggest that there is 
a trend toward lower MRU upon brentuximab vedotin use in the HL disease prevention treatment setting. 
This information will be reflected in the SmPC. 
Ancillary analyses 
Additional sensitivity analyses of PFS 
Some additional sensitivity analyses of PFS per IRF and investigator have been performed, all supporting 
the results of the primary PFS analysis (Table 8). 
Table 8: 
Summary of PFS sensitivity analyses - Study SGN35-005 
Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)  
A post hoc analysis of TTF was conducted for the AETHERA intent-to-treat (ITT) population. For this 
analysis, a treatment failure event was defined as: 
• 
Early discontinuation of treatment (received fewer than 16 cycles due to disease progression, 
toxicity, patient decision, or investigator decision). 
•  Starting subsequent therapy (Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, originally to 
have been exempted, are counted as events. In a potentially cured population, the need for 
subsequent transplantation signals treatment failure.). 
•  Disease progression, including progression events during the follow-up period. 
•  Death due to any cause. 
Time to treatment failure was calculated as the time from randomization to the earliest of any of the 
above events. Figure 11 shows the TTF per IRF.

Subsequent therapy 
More patients in the placebo arm received subsequent anticancer therapy (52%) compared with the 
brentuximab vedotin arm (31%) (Table 9). Of these, 18% (n=9/51, 5% of all brentuximab vedotin 
patients) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 85% (n=72/85) in the placebo arm received subsequent 
brentuximab vedotin. Twelve patients on brentuximab vedotin and 23 patients on placebo received a 
subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Table 9: 
Subsequent Antitumor Therapies (ITT Set) - Study SGN35-005 
In a post hoc analysis of time-to-next-treatment (TTNT), investigator-reported receipt of therapy for HL 
subsequent to placebo (placebo arm) or brentuximab vedotin (brentuximab vedotin arm) was considered 
a TTNT event. Patients without a TTNT event were censored at the date of their last follow-up. 
Figure 12 presents the Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to any of next subsequent therapy. This analysis, 
although not prespecified, yielded a positive HR (0.45, 95% CI=0.32, 0.64). 
Figure 12: 
Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Time from Randomization to First of Any Subsequent 
Therapy (ITT Population) - Study SGN35-005 
Assessing Crossover Effects: Time to Second Subsequent Treatment (TTSST) or Death  
Patients whose disease does not respond to first subsequent therapy or relapses after first subsequent 
therapy are likely to receive a second subsequent therapy or die. An analysis of the subsequent therapy 
following progression on first therapy is shown in Table 10 and Figure 13. Placebo patients who received 
brentuximab vedotin as first subsequent therapy after randomization had a proportionally fewer second 
subsequent therapy or death events than patients who had received brentixumab vedotin. It is important 
to note that placebo cannot be regarded as an active treatment, meaning that brentuximab vedotin upon 
relapse/progression in the placebo group is truly the first next line treatment.

This aspect was included in our assessment report, but not reported in this version.  There were 2 deaths 
in the larger brentuximab vedotin as first subsequent therapy group (N=63), compared to 4 deaths in the 
smaller Other Therapies as first-subsequent therapy group (N=22). The K-M plot showed a HR of 0.711 
(95%CI 0.491, 1.029).

Post hoc Risk Factor Analyses 
Post hoc analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of increased risk (number of risk factors) on 
clinical benefit. Representative risk factors for these analyses were: 
• 
• 
HL that occurred <12 months or HL that was refractory to frontline therapy 
Best response of PR or SD to most recent salvage therapy as determined by CT and/or PET 
scanning  
• 
• 
• 
Extranodal disease at pre ASCT relapse 
B symptoms at pre ASCT relapse 
Two or more prior salvage therapies. 
Post-hoc analyses for PFS by numbers of risk factors present was performed (Table 12).

Efficacy analyses based on risk factors was performed. Approximately half of randomised patients 
(84/164 placebo, 51%; 82/165 brentuximab vedotin, 50%) had ≥3 risk factors. Approximately one-third 
of randomised patients (52/164 placebo, 32%; 62/165 brentuximab vedotin, 38%) had 2 risk factors, 
and the remaining patients (28/164 placebo, 17%; 21/165 brentuximab vedotin, 13%) had only 1 risk 
factor. 
Alternatively, Table 13 presents the results of a stratified Kaplan-Meier analysis of PFS by risk factor 
subgroup (1, 2, or ≥3 risk factors; analyses of the 1 risk factor group were unstratified due to the small 
sample size). Of these subsets, only the placebo patients with ≥3 risk factors had recorded >50% of 
possible PFS events. For patients with 2 and ≥3 risk factors, HRs <1 were observed.

The KM curves for OS showed that there is no difference between the corresponding subgroups of the two 
study arms, at least for the 2 and the ≥3 risk factor groups. For the 1 risk factor group, the KM curve 
points at a detrimental effect of brentuximab vedotin treatment in terms of OS (though a limited number 
of patients is involved).  
The MAH has undertaken the requested post-hoc analysis of updated OS data using a data snapshot date 
of 14 October 2015. Since 2014, a total of 12 new OS events were recorded, with 6 events occurring in 
each treatment arm. Results of this analysis are provided for the ITT population and for the risk factor 
subgroups in Table 17.

PET scan prior to ASCT 
In AETHERA, PET scan results were available for 228/329 patients (69%), with approximately one third of 
patients PET positive (115/329, 35%), one third PET negative (113/329, 34%), and one third not 
assessed by PET after salvage therapy but before ASCT (101/329, 31%) (Table 18). PET status was 
captured by patients’ best response to pre-ASCT salvage therapy. No PET- patient in the AETHERA study

had a best overall response of partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) to salvage therapy, and no 
PET+ patient had a best overall response of CR. 
Table 18: 
Study SGN35-005: PET status versus number of risk factors and best response to 
salvage therapy (ITT population with PET status 
The impact of PET status on progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review facility (IRF) was 
evaluated separately in a prespecified analysis at the time of the primary assessment of the primary 
endpoint; PET+ status (PFS per IRF hazard ratio 0.611 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.360, 1.035]) and 
the presence of ≥2 of the 5 evaluated risk factors (HR=0.488 [95% CI 0.337, 0.706]) were each 
predictive of relapse (2014 data cut date). 
As illustrated in Figure 22 and Figure 23, this effect was stable as of the 2015 updated PFS per 
investigator data and showed the presence of ≥2 risk factors to be a strong predictor of PFS per 
investigator response.

Multivariate analyses to investigate treatment effect for risk factor covariates  
Multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model were also used to investigate treatment 
effect when adjusted for the 5 individual risk factor covariates (Table 19). 
Treatment was a highly statistically significant variable, both in a model unadjusted for covariates 
(p=0.002) and with adjustment (p=0.001). When explored individually, all 5 risk factors had a negative 
impact on PFS per IRF (HR 1.3-2.6), and this negative impact was statistically significant for 2 of the 5 
risk factors. The negative effect on PFS per IRF was most statistically significant for a best response to 
salvage therapy of partial response or stable disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.087, 2.296; p=0.016) and was 
most marked for patients whose HL was refractory to frontline therapy or relapsed within 12 months (HR 
2.56; 95% CI 1.129, 5.834; p=0.024).

Other Measures of Clinical Benefit 
Medical resource utilization (MRU) analyses showed that hospitalisation and outpatient visits, as well as 
working days/other activities missed by patients and caregivers were lower with brentuximab vedotin 
compared with placebo in patients with HL at increased risk of relapse, suggesting a trend towards lower 
MRU (Table 20).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly 
In the pivotal study, only 8 patients were 65 years or older. Subgroup analysis in patients ≥65 years of 
age indicated absence of brentuximab vedotin effect (HR>1). However, interpretation of PFS data for 
patients of age ≥65 years was limited due to the small number of patients in this category and their 
underlying age-related comorbidities. Of the 8 patients in this group there were 3 PFS events per IRF (2 
of 5 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm, including 1 death related to a secondary malignancy, and 1 
of 3 patients in the placebo arm).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study AETHERA was a phase III, randomised, double blind, and placebo controlled, comparing 
brentuximab vedotin and best supportive care (n=165) with placebo and best supportive care (n=164). 
Patients were required to have histologically confirmed classical HL, with autologous SCT in the previous 
30-45 days and were to be at increased risk of relapse or progression post-ASCT. The double-blinded 
design of the AETHERA trial is considered acceptable. The proposed dose of 1.8 mg/kg as an intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of 16 cycles used in the pivotal study is based on previous 
submitted dose finding studies, and is similar to the posology included in the SmPC for the approved HL 
indications.  
There were a number of protocol amendments and violations, but these were considered minor and are 
not expected to have affected the outcomes from the pivotal study. The other changes in analysis/SAP 
are not considered to have impacted the analysis or interpretation, especially not of the most important 
efficacy outcomes (i.e., PFS and OS). The applicant obtained national scientific advice in January 2014 on 
the proposal to revise the triggering of the primary analysis. The newly proposed time-driven analysis 
was considered acceptable assuming a HR <0.73. In general, the statistical methods are considered 
standard and acceptable. The CHMP did not raise any specific issue with the overall conduct of the trial. 
The selection of PFS as the primary endpoint of the pivotal study is considered acceptable in view of the 
relatively long life expectancy of patients with HL after ASCT. As disease progression was defined only in 
terms of a diagnostic biopsy or radiographic assessment, demonstration of a sustained clinical benefit for 
patients is considered important. As brentuximab vedotin was approved in relapsed/ refractory HL after 
ASCT halfway during the AETHERA study, cross over to brentuximab vedotin in the placebo arm after 
progression was inevitable and is likely to have affected the OS results.  
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the two 
treatment arms, except for a slight imbalance in gender: 59% of patients were male in the placebo arm 
compared with 46% in the brentuximab vedotin arm. This imbalance is considered to not have an 
important effect on the analyses. 
The included patient population was very heterogeneous regarding disease state at the time of study 
inclusion. In both treatment arms, 42% had achieved CR as best response with the most recent prior 
salvage therapy, 34% PR, and 24% stable disease. In addition, 35% of patients were PET FDG-avid prior 
to ASCT, and 34% was PET FDG-negative. 
Similar numbers of patients were off study treatment at the time of the primary analysis in both arms, 
while the main reason for patients being off study was different in both arms. For brentuximab vedotin-
treated patients, the main reason was an adverse event (n=54, vs n=10 in the placebo arm). In the 
placebo arm, the main reason was progressive disease (n=69, vs n=24 in the brentuximab vedotin arm). 
A low number of withdrawals of consent/off-treatment due to patient decision in the placebo arm was 
observed, which was similar in the brentuximab vedotin arm. This suggests that informative censoring 
(e.g. study discontinuation due to absence of brentuximab vedotin specific AEs, and thereby possible 
unblinding) did not play a role in patients discontinuing the treatment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Progression free survival 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial was met: an 18.8 months PFS improvement has been observed 
with brentuximab vedotin treatment (42.9 months vs. 24.1 months placebo; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, 
IRF analysis). The magnitude of the increase in PFS is considered clinically relevant.  However, it appears 
that most PFS benefit is obtained in the first months after start of treatment where a rapid increase in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 47/83 
 
  
  
events in the placebo arm was observed in the first 6 months of treatment and less steep PFS Kaplan 
Meier (KM) curves after that point in time in both arms. Furthermore, the KM curves of the investigator-
based PFS sensitivity analysis, including clinical lymphoma assessments, showed a plateau phase at the 
end of the curve, with a larger difference between the curves compared with the primary IRF-based PFS 
analysis, suggesting that PFS could be a surrogate marker for some patients that may have been cured in 
the experimental arm that did not experience an event up to reaching the plateau phase in the PFS KM 
curve. For the patients in the placebo arm, brentuximab vedotin is still a treatment option upon 
progression/relapse resulting in an additional long-term PFS for about 15-20% of the patients.. 
Patients with the highest risk for relapse in almost every subgroup category (e.g. best response to 
salvation therapy of PR, ECOG status = 1, >2 treatments prior to ASCT, FDG positivity prior to ASCT, B 
symptoms after frontline therapy failure or extranodal involvement pre-ASCT) seemed to have more 
benefit from brentuximab vedotin as indicated by lower hazard ratio’s, compared with the lower risk 
categories in the respective subgroups. When comparing the actual PFS rate in the brentuximab vedotin 
and placebo arm, this improved benefit can most likely be explained by a lower PFS rate in the placebo 
arm for a number of subgroup categories.  
The PFS subgroup analysis showed a consistent trend towards benefit for patients who received 
brentuximab vedotin compared with patients who received placebo with the exception of patients ≥ 65 
years of age. However, this subgroup consisted of few patients (n=8), limiting the possibility to draw a 
final conclusion. 
Post hoc subset analyses of both PFS and OS were undertaken using 5 risk factors, i.e. relapsed <12 
months or refractory to frontline therapy, best response of PR or SD to most recent salvage therapy, 
extranodal disease at pre-ASCT relapse, B symptoms at pre-ASCT relapse and two or more prior salvage 
therapies, in an attempt to understand the impact of the number of risk factors on efficacy outcomes. The 
most PFS benefit is observed in the group of brentuximab vedotin-treated patients with ≥2 risk factors. 
This is clearly absent in the 1 risk factor group, although the number of patients in this group was limited 
(21 patients vs. 28 patients on placebo). These observations are supported by the results from the PFS 
HR analyses. 
A post hoc analysis of time to treatment failure (TTF) was conducted for the AETHERA intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population. The curves of the TTF analyses per investigator and per IRF are highly similar, meaning 
that the results are consistent. The results of the (variants of) the requested TTF analyses show that the 
brentuximab vedotin treatment is effective in the early treatment phase relative to placebo, fitting the 
results from the primary PFS analyses. Moreover, early discontinuation in general, starting subsequent 
therapy, disease progression and death due to any cause did all not influence this effect. The results from 
the TTF analyses excluding early discontinuation due to an adverse event imply that brentuximab vedotin 
treatment is associated with substantial toxicity leading to early discontinuation of therapy. Together, this 
strengthens the findings that brentuximab vedotin may bring clinical benefit to a selected population at 
higher risk of relapse as this population would be able to better tolerate the added toxicity of the 
maintenance regimen. 
A post hoc analysis of time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) was performed based on investigator-reported 
receipt of therapy for HL subsequent to placebo or brentuximab vedotin was considered a TTNT event. 
The data showed that brentuximab vedotin can postpone the next or any subsequent therapy, indicating 
a meaningful clinical benefit of the treatment. It is important to note that placebo cannot be regarded as 
an active treatment, meaning that brentuximab vedotin upon relapse/progression in the placebo group is 
truly the first next line treatment. This has important consequences for the assessment of time to first 
subsequent therapy after progression is not the same between the two treatment arms where the time to 
2nd subsequent therapy (the first therapy after brentuximab) in the placebo group should be compared 
with the time to 1st subsequent therapy in the brentuximab vedotin group (15 months vs 18.7 months, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 48/83 
 
  
  
respectively). Likewise, the time to 3rd therapy in the placebo group should be compared with the time to 
2nd therapy in the brentuximab vedotin arm (23 months vs 22 months, respectively). In this respect it is 
important to remember that brentuximab vedotin is a highly effective treatment, even in the 
relapsed/refractory setting (relative to the other options). Direct comparison of brentuximab vedotin and 
placebo treated patients in the time to next treatment analyses is hampered by the fact that most 
placebo patients cross over to brentuximab vedotin after progression.  
The PET-positive result in the placebo arm and in the brentuximab vedotin arm yielded similar PFS per 
investigator data as compared to the results of the patients selected based on ≥2 risk factors in the 
respective study arms. Patients with a PET-positive scan had ≥2 risk factors, i.e. approximately 99%, 
while 60% of the patients with PET-negative results had ≥2 risk factors. Hence, there is an overlap 
between patients with PET scans ( either positive or negative) and patients with ≥2 risk factors. It is of 
note that patients with CR after salvage therapy had PET-scan negative results, while no patients with a 
PET-scan positive results had a CR. Considering that all but 1 patient with positive PET scan results had 
≥2 risk factors, these data together mean that all patients with ≥2 risk factors had PR or SD as best 
response and hence are at risk for progression. The PFS results according to PET positive or negative are 
consistent with the results from the results of the patients selected based on ≥2 risk factors in the 
respective study arms. There was no difference in PFS in favour of brentuximab vedotin in PET-negative 
patients. However, in PET-negative patients having ≥2 risk factors resulted in a trend for a PFS per 
investigator difference between the 2 study arms, also at the late time points. The same trend was seen 
for patients with CR, although also here few patients were at risk at 24 or 36 months.  Therefore, it 
appears that selection of patients having ≥2 risk factors seems to be a better prognostic tool to use in the 
clinic to select those patients that experience PFS benefit at 34 and 36 months after transplantation than 
using PET scan data (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Following the assessment of the responses, the indication was revised to take into account the inclusion 
criteria of the pivotal study which recruited only patients with classical HL: this subtype of HL is 
characterized by CD30 expression, the target of the antibody drug conjugate Adcetris. Hence, the 
indication includes the wording “treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL” to more accurately reflect 
the inclusion criterion of the pivotal study concerning the CD30+ status. In addition, as it was shown that 
the subgroup of patients with ≥2 risk factors benefited the most from the maintenance treatment, the 
wording “at increased risk of relapse or progression” was included to reflect the population of patients 
which had the greatest increase in PFS. A reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC provides further 
information on the risk factors used to define those patients at higher/increased risk of progression. 
Overall survival 
The secondary endpoint OS did not show a difference between the treatment arms for the total study 
population and not for the 2 or ≥3 risk factors. The estimated 24-month OS rate was 88% (brentuximab 
vedotin) vs. 89% (placebo), which is in line with OS rates after ASCT in literature. It is unclear the reason 
why no improvement in OS was observed considering the magnitude of the effect observed for PFS. A 
possible explanation is that patients in the placebo group were allowed to cross-over once they 
progressed, confounding the OS results. As a result, the OS data will only be mature in 2020. Although 
an effect on OS would have been an important clinical benefit to patients, the CHMP was reassured that 
the maintenance treatment had no detrimental effect in OS in the long term.  
Quality of life 
Mean differences in EQ-5D TTO index or VAS scores generally did not exceed the minimally important 
difference (MID) between treatment arms. In both arms TTO index scores became slightly lower during 
the trial, but with/without imputation for death did not reveal differences between the treatment arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 49/83 
 
  
  
 
 
The reduction in the scores as compared to baseline could not be explained by treatment-emergent 
peripheral neuropathy (a known treatment-related AE of brentuximab vedotin) on the brentuximab 
vedotin arm. In contrast, VAS scores increased a few points in both arms during the trial. Therefore, the 
QoL data did not support the primary efficacy analysis, but at the same time also did not show a 
detrimental effect of brentuximab vedotin on the QoL as compared to placebo.  
No differences were observed in quality of life between the treatment and placebo arms. Medical resource 
utilization (MRU) analysis showed that hospitalizations and outpatient visits, as well as working 
days/other activities missed by patients and caregivers were lower with brentuximab vedotin compared 
with placebo in patients with HL at increased risk of relapse. 
Additional expert consultation 
On the 14th April 2016, a SAG-O was convened to address a list of questions adopted by the CHMP. 
Please discuss the rationale and the (potential) added value of an early maintenance 
treatment regimen like the currently proposed regimen with Adcetris (Brentuximab (B) 
Vedotin (V) compared to “watchful waiting” in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma at increased 
risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. The following issues should be taking into 
consideration: 
a.  Is the selection of patients for early treatment based on two or more risk factors for 
relapse or progression following ASCT, feasible and desirable in clinical practice? 
There is a biologic rationale and clinical need for early ("maintenance") treatment of patients at high risk 
of relapse or progression after ASCT in particular due to the poor prognosis after progression, the limited 
number of salvage therapies, and the aim to avoid or delay, if possible, more intensive treatments such 
as allogeneic transplant, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
The identification of patients at high risk of relapse or progression based on the five risk factors proposed 
is feasible as these are routinely available, and the importance of these risk factors is well established.  
Although the threshold of two or more risk factors out of the five factors selected is plausible and feasible, 
it is difficult to ascertain if it is optimal. The proposed classification was a post-hoc exercise limited by the 
choice of data collected in the pivotal trial and the weaknesses of exploratory analyses. Concerning the 
limitations, available data did not allow exhaustive exploration of all possible important prognostic 
factors. For instance, evidence of residual disease based on PET-scan prior or following ASCT may be 
even more important than any of the five selected factors yet it was not systematically recorded or 
included in the analyses. Also, the exclusion of patients with just one risk factor is based on an 
exploratory subgroup analysis (showing a higher rate of progression associated with BV), lacks 
independent confirmation and a strong biological rationale. Still, from a clinical point of view, the aim of 
selecting patients at higher risk for early treatment with BV seems justified and the proposed approach is 
useful albeit possibly not optimal. Furthermore, the identification of prognostic markers and marker by 
treatment interactions is continuously evolving and the search for optimal thresholds and markers is 
difficult, particularly in a rare disease setting. Still, it should be considered if available or future data could 
allow a more comprehensive analysis to elucidate the association between prognostic factors and 
treatment effect. 
b.  Does the improvement in PFS of approximately 18.8 months upon maintenance treatment 
of HL patients indicate clinical benefit in the context of the results of the OS and QoL 
analyses? 
The magnitude of the difference in PFS associated with BV compared to placebo is probably better 
expressed by comparing the Kaplan-Meier estimates at fixed time points (e.g., two years after 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 50/83 
 
  
  
randomization) and in any case suffers of possible biases due to possible differences in the censoring 
mechanisms between treatment groups as well as adjudication. Such biases are difficult to rule out 
completely although rigorous analysis may provide further reassurance.  
Still, even acknowledging possible bias, a sustained treatment effect in a significant proportion of patients 
being alive and free of progression two years from randomization is apparent, with the effect continuing 
several years after randomization. In view of the reasons explained above about the clinical importance of 
delaying progression and the burden of aggressive salvage treatments, the observed effect on PFS is a 
clear clinical benefit. The available data showing reduced need for salvage therapy including allo-
transplant support this conclusion. 
The hypothesis that the sustained effect on PFS associated with early treatment with BV represents cure 
from HD for some patients and that the effect on PFS is associated with a beneficial effect on OS 
compared to early treatment with placebo, is attractive. An effect on OS would indeed be expected given 
the sustained effect several years after starting treatment. Thus, failure to observe a treatment effect in 
terms of OS in the pivotal trial is unexpected.  
Failure to observe a difference in OS may be due to a number of reasons, such as the high rate of 
treatment switching from placebo to BV after progression (assuming that BV in the salvage setting is 
associated with a comparable or higher effect on OS compared to the early treatment setting) or lack of 
power of the OS analysis. Absence of an observed difference might also be related to the more aggressive 
salvage and allotransplant in the observational arm (23 vs 11) for patients with at least 2 risk factors. 
Alternatively, it may be that early BV treatment strategy is not associated with superior effect on OS 
compared to placebo and salvage (including BV) or that indeed BV is not associated with any effect on OS 
(early or in salvage treatment). The available data do not allow definitively establishing the reason for 
failure to observe an effect on OS in the pivotal trial. Given the strong effect on PFS, the high proportion 
of treatment switching in the placebo group seems the most plausible hypothesis for failure to observe an 
effect on OS.  
Regardless of the reason for failure to observe a difference in OS, it is reassuring that there is no 
indication of a possible detriment in terms of OS, except for patients with only one risk factor. Lack of a 
detrimental effect is a pre-requisite for clinical decisions based on PFS. More importantly, even in the 
absence of a demonstrated effect on OS, avoiding or delaying salvage treatment in a significant 
proportion of patients is in itself considered a clinical benefit.  
The small detriment in QoL is expected in view of the toxicity associated with BV. However, the impact is 
not considered to outweigh the benefit in terms of delaying or avoiding subsequent salvage therapy, 
which is known to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pivotal study supports the 
tolerability of treatment with BV.  Overall 32% v. 6% of patients discontinued BV v. control due to AEs.  
Dose delays and reductions were 54% v. 25% and 32% v. 3% for BV v. control, respectively.  However, 
treatment discontinuations occurred in the late course of treatment, with the median number of 15 
delivered cycles out of 16 planned cycles (albeit at lower dose intensity). 
The possibility of continuing follow-up for safety/efficacy of the pivotal trial should be considered in the 
light of the high risk of second cancers for Hodgkin patients, including second cancers due to subsequent 
treatments. 
c.  Please discuss the clinical value of the additional and updated efficacy results (e.g. 3 year 
PFS data, time to next treatment and number of subsequent treatments and PFS per 
Investigator Including Clinical Lymphoma Assessments) in the early HL treatment setting. 
The different PFS analyses are broadly consistent. Although time to next treatment and number of 
subsequent treatments are subject to investigator choice, which may be arbitrary and prone to bias, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 51/83 
 
  
  
there are clear differences in terms of subsequent salvage treatments that support the clinical relevance 
of the PFS findings. 
d.  Is the safety profile of early treatment acceptable for the intended patient population, also 
taking into account that not all patients will benefit from this regimen? 
From a clinical perspective, the toxicity associated with BV does not outweigh the clinical benefit 
described above for the overall population and the benefit-risk balance is clearly positive. The fact that 
not all patients will benefit from this treatment is unfortunately not uncommon for cancer treatments. 
Ultimately, acceptability of risks of toxicity compared to the importance of delaying progression, worse 
prognosis and salvage treatments is a matter of judgment that needs to take into account individual 
preferences, as is usually the case in clinical decisions about adjuvant treatments with the likelihood of 
better long-term control albeit at the risk of some severe and possibly life-threatening toxicity, in 
potentially cured patients. In this high-risk population, however, the tradeoff between benefits of early 
treatment with BV and risks of toxicity appears largely in favour of treatment with BV. The fact that 
treatment discontinuations due to toxicity was infrequent and the fact that toxicity was largely reversible, 
support this conclusion (see answers to question b). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The substantial improvement in PFS is considered clinically relevant, however, the translation to objective 
clinical benefit for patients in terms of OS, or QoL could not be demonstrated in the overall population 
and for the subgroup population characterized by ≥ 2 risk factors. A statement in the SmPC has been 
included in section 5.1 that the results of the post hoc analyses indicate increased clinical benefit for 
patients with two or more risk factors but no difference based on any of the individual risk factors. No 
benefit in terms of PFS or OS has been observed in patients with one risk factor for relapse or 
progression.  The maintenance treatment showed that the time to first subsequent treatment could be 
postponed by a few months (~3.7 months) and cause a small decrease in number of subsequent 
treatments (~12%) in HL patients following ASCT, especially in patients with ≥ 2 risk factors.  For patients 
who relapse after ASCT, there are limited treatment options and patients will eventually die from their 
disease. Hence, delaying the time to progression and relapse (i.e. prolonging remission), and subsequent 
administration of toxic treatments is considered a clinically meaningful benefit to this high risk patient 
population.  
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
•  Submission of the final OS data from study SGN35-005 in 2020. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The existing safety profile of brentuximab vedotin monotherapy was mainly based on two single arm 
phase II studies in 160 HL and sALCL patients. The median number of cycles was 9 in patients with 
relapsed or refractory HL and 7 in patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. Treatment-related adverse 
events were common, leading to treatment discontinuation in 19% of patients and dose modifications in 
46% of patients. The most common brentuximab vedotin treatment-related AE in the pivotal studies were 
peripheral neuropathy (55%, leading to treatment discontinuation (12%), and dose reductions (10%)), 
myelosuppression, infections and infusion reactions. The majority of AEs were managed by dose delays or 
reduction. One of the patients suffering from PML upon the use of brentuximab vedotin died. 
Assessment report

The safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in patients with HL at increased risk of relapse or 
progression following ASCT was analysed in one pivotal study, the AETHERA trial. The safety analysis set 
comprised of 327 patients with at least 1 dose of study treatment.  
Patient exposure 
ADCETRIS was administered as monotherapy in 160 patients in two phase 2 studies in patients with 
relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL. The median number of cycles was 9 in patients with relapsed or 
refractory HL and 7 in patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. ADCETRIS was also administered as 
monotherapy in 167 out of 329 patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients 
with HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. In the pivotal study 167 patients were 
exposed to brentuximab vedotin and 160 patients received placebo. The median number of cycles 
received in both arms was 15: 47.9 weeks (15 cycles) in the brentuximab vedotin arm, compared with 
47.4 weeks (15 cycles) in the placebo arm. Approximately half of the patients in each treatment arm 
received 16 cycles of study treatment (Figure 24). At the data cut-off for the primary efficacy analysis (18 
Aug 2014), 251 patients (76%) remained in long-term follow up; 74% in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
and 79% in the placebo arm. 
Figure 24: 
Duration of Treatment (number of cycles) - Study SGN35-005 
The median relative dose intensity was 95% in the brentuximab vedotin arm versus 99.8% in the placebo 
arm.  
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using MedDRA. In 
the safety analysis set, at least 1 AE of any grade was reported in 98% of patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm compared with 89% in the placebo arm (Table 22). At least 1 treatment related AE was 
reported in 88% (brentuximab vedotin) vs. 49% (placebo), and at least one SAE in 25% vs. 13%. An AE 
that led to treatment discontinuation was reported in 32% vs. 6% of patients.

Overview of Adverse Events (Safety Analysis Set) - Study SGN35-005 
The impact of the following 5 risk factors on the safety profile of patients receiving brentuximab vedotin 
or placebo in the AETHERA study was analysed by risk factor group (1, 2, or ≥3): 
•  Relapsed <12 months or refractory to frontline therapy 
•  Best response of PR or SD to most recent salvage therapy 
•  Extranodal disease at pre-ASCT relapse 
•  B symptoms at pre-ASCT relapse

The treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported for ≥15% in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
were peripheral sensory neuropathy (56% vs 16% placebo), neutropenia (35% vs 12%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (26% vs 23%), fatigue (24% vs 18%), peripheral motor neuropathy (23% vs

decreased weight (19% vs 6%), arthralgia (18% vs 9%), and vomiting (16% vs 7%). 
TEAEs that had a higher risk of occurring in patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm than patients in the 
placebo arm, as indicated by a relative risk >1 and a confidence interval that does not include 1, were 
peripheral motor neuropathy, paraesthesia, abdominal pain, constipation, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
decreased weight, neutropenia, nausea, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhoea, and arthralgia (Figure 25).

Treatment related adverse events 
The treatment-related TEAEs reported for ≥10% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (and more 
frequently compared with the placebo arm) were peripheral sensory neuropathy (54% of patients); 
neutropenia (32%); peripheral motor neuropathy (23%); nausea (16%); fatigue (13%); and diarrhoea, 
arthralgia, and vomiting (10% each; Table 24). Peripheral sensory neuropathy (14% of patients) was the 
only treatment-related TEAE reported for ≥10% of patients in the placebo arm.

Treatment Arm (Safety Analysis Set) - Study SGN35-005 
Grade 3 or higher adverse events 
The Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported for ≥5% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm were 
neutropenia (29% of patients vs 10% in placebo arm), peripheral sensory neuropathy (10% vs 1%), and 
peripheral motor neuropathy (6% vs 1%). Neutropenia (10% of patients) was the only Grade 3 or higher 
TEAE reported for ≥5% of patients in the placebo arm. 
At least 1 Grade 4 TEAE was reported for 21 patients (13%) in the brentuximab vedotin treatment arm 
and 10 patients (6%) in the placebo arm. Neutropenia was the most commonly reported Grade 4 TEAE 
(7% brentuximab vedotin vs 4% placebo). 
The number of patients with infection events is shown in Table 25. Patients could have experienced >1 
infection event, and this is reflected in the number of events. The duration of infection events was 
calculated based upon individual infection events.

The median duration of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia events was the same for the brentuximab vedotin and 
placebo arms (8 days), and the median duration of infection events was comparable across the treatment 
and placebo arms (11 vs 13 days).  
At least 1 Grade 5 TEAE was reported for 5 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 2 patients in the 
placebo arm. The Grade 5 TEAEs reported for the brentuximab vedotin arm were acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) (2 patients); and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), bladder cancer, and 
pancreatic cancer (1 patient each). The Grade 5 TEAEs reported for the placebo arm were ARDS and MDS 
(1 patient each).

SAEs considered related to study treatment were experienced by 11% of patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 4% in the placebo arm. Treatment-related SAEs reported in ≥2 patients in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm were vomiting in 4 patients (2%), nausea, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
pneumonia, and pyrexia in 3 patients each (2%), and ARDS and headache in 2 patients each (1%). The 
only treatment-related SAE reported in ≥2 patients in the placebo arm was thrombocytopenia in 2 
patients (1%).  
Deaths 
At the cut-off date for data analysis, death was reported for 28 patients (17%) in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 25 patients (16%) in the placebo arm. In the brentuximab vedotin arm, death was 
considered to be disease related for 18 patients, and not disease related for 9 patients. For the placebo 
arm, death was considered to be disease related for 17 patients, and not disease related for 7 patients. 
The disease relationship was unknown for 1 patient in each treatment arm. 
The causes of death are described in Table 27.

Patient Deaths (Safety Analysis Set) - Study SGN35-005 
According to investigator assessment, 5 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 3 patients in the 
placebo arm died before they experienced disease progression (4 and 3 patients resp. by IRF). For the 5 
patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm who died before disease progression, the cause of death was 
reported as:  
-  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for 2 patients 
o 
o 
In 1 patient associated with pneumonitis, considered treatment related (died within 30 
days of last dose of study treatment) 
In 1 patient associated with pneumonia, considered not treatment related. This followed 
an episode of acute pancreatitis and earlier episode of ARDS both considered treatment 
related and resolved at time of death (patient died on study day 40).

-  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), cardiac arrest and bladder cancer 1 patient each.  
For the three patients in the placebo arm who died before disease progression, the cause of death was 
reported as MDS, aplastic anemia, and fungal pneumonia. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of interest were selected based on the known safety profile of brentuximab vedotin. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (PN) was reported for 41% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
and 34% in the placebo arm, and attributed to prior neurotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens or other pre-
existing conditions. At least one treatment-emergent PN event during the study was reported for 67% of 
patients in the brentuximab vedotin group and 19% in the placebo group. It was considered treatment 
related in 63% and 18%, respectively.  
PN events of Grade 3 in severity were reported for 13% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 
1% in the placebo arm. No Grade 4 events were reported.  
Dose modifications for PN were instituted for 31% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm. Overall, 
57% of patients with dose modifications for PN received the complete 16 cycles of treatment; for patients 
who completed fewer than 16 cycles, the median number of cycles was 10.5. Twenty-five percent of 
patients who had dose modifications for PN subsequently discontinued treatment because of PN (23% on 
brentuximab vedotin vs 2% placebo). 
The median time to onset of a PN event in the brentuximab vedotin group was 13.7 weeks.  For the 44 
patients with at least one event of peripheral motor neuropathy, the median time of onset was 32.7 
weeks. Among patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy in the phase 3 population, the median 
follow up time from end of treatment until last evaluation was approximately 98 weeks. At the time of 
last evaluation, 85% of patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
experienced resolution or improvement of their peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Overall, the median 
time to resolution or improvement of peripheral neuropathy events in the brentuximab vedotin arm was 
23.4 weeks (range from 0.1 weeks to 138.3 weeks).Complete resolution or improvement of all PN events 
occurred in 73% of patients and complete resolution of all PN events occurred in 59% of patients. 
In the brentuximab vedotin safety set, 112 patients (67%) experienced a treatment-emergent event of 
PN. The majority of PN events had resolved or shown improvement as of the 2014 data cut date and were 
continuing to resolve or improve as of the 2015 data cut date (Table 28). 
Table 28: 
Study SGN35-005: Reversibility of Treatment-Emergent Peripheral Neuropathy 
Pulmonary toxicity 
Overall, 13 patients (4%) experienced at least 1 event of pulmonary toxicity, which included 8 patients 
(5%) in the brentuximab vedotin group and 5 patients (3%) in the placebo group (Table 29). Preferred 
terms reported in more than 1 patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm were pneumonitis in 4 patients 
(2% vs n=1, 1% placebo) and ARDS and pulmonary toxicity in 2 patients (1%) each. Lung infiltration 
was the only preferred term reported in more than 1 patient in the placebo arm. 
Assessment report

Four patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm had pulmonary toxicity AEs considered related to study 
treatment; preferred terms were Grade 2 lung infiltration/pneumonitis, Grade 4 pneumonitis/Grade 5 
ARDS, Grade 2 pneumonitis, and Grade 2 pulmonary toxicity. 
Pulmonary toxicities of Grade 3 or higher in severity were reported for 4 patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin group (pneumonitis and ARDS in 2 patients each, and pulmonary toxicity in 1 patient) and 2 
patients in the placebo group (ARDS, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome).

SGN35-005 
Hepatotoxicity 
Overall, 11 patients (7%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 4 patients (3%) in the placebo group 
experienced AEs consistent with hepatotoxicity. The preferred terms reported for ≥1 patient in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm were hepatoxicity (5 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (3 
patients), and hepatic steatosis, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased 
transaminases (2 patients each). Increased blood bilirubin was reported for 2 patients in the placebo arm.  
Grade 3 or higher hepatotoxicity was reported for 7 patients in the brentuximab vedotin group and 4 
patients in the placebo group. In the brentuximab vedotin arm these events were hepatoxicity (4 
patients), increased ALT (3 patients), and increased AST (2 patients). In the placebo arm these were 
increased blood bilirubin, increased ALT and hepatotoxicity. 
One patient in the brentuximab vedotin group was evaluated as a possible Hy’s Law candidate. The 
investigator attributed the patient’s hepatic dysfunction to a reactivation of viral hepatitis B and assessed 
the event as unrelated to brentuximab vedotin. This patient was therefore not considered to have met the 
criteria for Hy’s Law.  
Infections 
At least one TEAE of infection and infestation SOC was reported for 60% in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
and 50% in the placebo arm. Grade 3 or higher was reported in 7% and 5% respectively, SAEs were 
reported in 9 and 4%. 
Upper respiratory tract infection was the most commonly reported TEAE in this SOC, occurring in 26% of 
patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm vs 23% in the placebo arm. Pneumonia was the most commonly 
reported SAE in both arms ( 4% brentuximab vedotin and 3% placebo). 
Opportunistic infections were reported for 12% in the brentuximab vedotin arm, and 4% in the placebo 
arm. With the exception of herpes zoster (7% vs 3%)  and simplex (4% vs 1%), which were primarily

Grade 1 or Grade 2, the number of reported opportunistic infections was balanced between the treatment 
groups. No events of bacteraemia, sepsis or septic shock were reported in the brentuximab vedotin arm. 
Grade 1 febrile neutropenia, associated with Grade 3 neutropenia and Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, was 
reported for 1 patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm and considered to be treatment related.  
Haematologic toxicity 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was reported as a TEAE for 35% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 12% in the 
placebo arm. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia was reported for 29% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 
10% in the placebo arm. One case of febrile neutropenia was reported in the brentuximab vedotin arm. 
Despite being the most common reason for dose delays (22% vs 7% placebo), no patients had dose 
reductions or discontinued treatment for neutropenia. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In 7% of brentuximab vedotin treated patients, thrombocytopenia of any grade was reported, versus 3% 
in the placebo arm. Grade 3 was reported in 2% of brentuximab vedotin treated patients versus 1% with 
placebo, Grade 4 in 2% in both arms. Thrombocytopenia led to a dose delay for 2% (n=3) in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm, and to treatment discontinuation for 1 patient in each treatment arm. 
Anaemia 
In 8% of brentuximab vedotin treated patients versus 3% in the placebo arm anaemia was reported. 
Grade 3 was reported for 4% in the brentuximab vedotin arm versus 2% in the placebo arm. No Grade 4 
anaemia, dose delay or discontinuation as a result of anaemia was reported. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Treatment-emergent hyperglycaemia was reported for 3% (n=5) in the brentuximab vedotin group and 
1% (n=1; grade 2) in the placebo group. Four of the 5 patients in the brentuximab vedotin group had 
Grade 3 hyperglycaemia (including 1 patient with treatment emergent Grade 1 Type II diabetes), and one 
had Grade 1 hyperglycaemia. All 5 patients who had hyperglycaemia in brentuximab vedotin group had 
pre-existing Grade 3 or 4 obesity, 2 had pre-existing Grade 1 hyperglycaemia, and 1 had baseline Grade 
1 fatty liver. Hyperglycaemia began in 3 patients while taking steroids and 3 of the 5 hyperglycaemia 
events were considered unrelated to study treatment. 
Secondary malignancies 
When recurrent HL and non-malignant neoplasms were excluded from this analysis, 4 patients (2%) in 
the brentuximab vedotin arm and 2 patients (1%) in the placebo arm had a secondary malignancy. 
Secondary malignancies in the brentuximab vedotin group were MDS, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and 
bladder cancer. Secondary malignancies in the placebo group were MDS and mantle cell lymphoma. 
Two secondary malignancies (bladder cancer in a brentuximab vedotin patient and mantle cell lymphoma 
in a placebo patient) were reported during the treatment period and 4 secondary malignancies were 
reported during long-term follow up (2 reports of MDS [1 in each treatment group] and 1 report each of 
pancreatic cancer and lung cancer in the brentuximab vedotin group). 
All of the patients who developed secondary malignancies died; in 4 of the 6 patients, the secondary 
malignancy was the primary cause of death. 
Other rarely reported TEAEs of clinical importance 
Grade 4 acute pancreatitis and Grade 3 myelitis (radiation myelitis in a previous radiation field) were 
reported for 1 patient each in the brentuximab vedotin treatment arm. Both TEAEs were reported as SAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 62/83 
 
  
  
and considered to be treatment related. The grade 4 acute pancreatitis resolved. The grade 3 myelitis did 
not resolve. 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, tumour lysis syndrome or progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy were not reported for any patient in this study. 
Immunological events 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
Patients with HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT in the phase 3 study were 
tested for antibodies to brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks using a sensitive electrochemiluminescent 
immunoassay. At baseline, 12% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm, and  8% in the placebo arm 
were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Of the 157 ADA-evaluable patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm, 59 (35%) tested ADA-positive at any post-baseline visit, compared with 32% in the placebo 
arm. Most patients in both treatment arms were transiently positive post-baseline. Approximately 7% of 
patients in the phase 2 studies and 6% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm of the phase 3 study 
developed persistently positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Post-baseline ADA titres were higher in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm compared with placebo at all treatment cycles, and post-baseline ADA titres in 
the placebo arm were similar to baseline titres. In the brentuximab vedotin arm, the majority of ADA-
positive patients first showed a positive result at Cycle 2. In the placebo arm, the proportion of patients 
who first tested ADA positive was distributed among all time points tested. Two patients in the phase 3 
study experienced adverse reactions consistent with IRRs that led to discontinuation of treatment. 
The overall incidence of AEs and the incidence of more severe AEs did not appear to be greater in 
persistently ADA-positive patients relative to transiently ADA-positive or never positive patients (Table 
30). The number of SAEs was slightly higher (10%, n=1/10) in persistently positive brentuximab vedotin 
treated patients compared with ADA negative brentuximab vedotin treated patients (5%, n=5/92). 
However, interpretation of these data is limited by the small number of patients who became persistently 
ADA positive.

Table 30: 
Overall summary of adverse events by ADA status (baseline ADA-negative) - 
Study SGN35-005 
Infusion related reactions (IRR) 
For patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm who were ADA negative at baseline, a higher incidence of 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs) was observed in persistently ADA-positive patients (9/10, 90%) and 
transiently ADA-positive patients (9/36, 25%), relative to ADA-negative patients (4/92, 4%). 
Overall, possible IRRs occurred in 15% of patients (n=25) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 2% of 
patients (n=3) in the placebo group. The most frequently reported IRRs in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
were nausea and chills (4% each), and dyspnoea, headache, pruritus and rash in 2% each. Most patients 
(52%; 13/25) with an IRR had only 1 IRR, 28% (n=7) had 2 IRRs and 10% (n=5) had ≥3 events. The 
majority of patients (60%; 15/25) had their first IRR in Cycle 2.  
In either the phase 2 population or the phase 3 population, the adverse events most commonly 
associated with IRRs were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or Grade 2), transient (occurring in 1 or 2 
treatment cycles), and did not lead to significant dosing delays or reductions, or treatment 
discontinuation and included headache, rash, back pain, vomiting, chills, nausea, dyspnoea, pruritus, and 
cough. Grade 3 events were reported in 3 of the 25 patients who experienced IRRs. No Grade 4 IRRs 
were reported.  
IRRs were reported as SAEs for two patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (1 patient with Grade 2 
bradycardia and Grade 3 syncope and another patient with Grade 2 bronchospasm, presyncope, and 
rash). Both patients discontinued because of the events. No other patients discontinued due to IRRs. No 
cases of anaphylaxis were reported.  
Study procedures did not require premedication for patients before the brentuximab vedotin infusion, but 
it was allowed before subsequent infusions for patients who experienced a prior IRR, at the discretion of 
the investigator and according to institutional guidelines. 
Laboratory findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 64/83 
 
  
  
 
At least 1 Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality was reported for 41% of patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 18% of patients in the placebo arm. The Grade 3 or higher abnormal clinical laboratory 
values reported for ≥5% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm were low neutrophils (23% of 
patients), low leukocytes and lymphocytes (11% each), and low platelets (5%). Grade 3 or higher 
abnormal clinical laboratory values reported for ≥5% of patients in the placebo arm were low neutrophils 
(6% of patients) and low lymphocytes (5%).  
Hematologic and clinical chemistry values were further discussed in the previous sections hepatotoxicity, 
hematologic toxicity and hyperglycaemia. 
ECG changes 
ECGs for 6 patients were noted as having clinically significant abnormalities; all were associated with 
cardiac AEs or baseline conditions. With the exception of Grade 3 pleural effusion at the end of treatment 
in a patient in the placebo arm, all cardiac AEs with clinically significant ECGs were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. 
Of the patients with normal ECGs at baseline with available EOT ECG values, only 1 patient in the placebo 
arm demonstrated an abnormal ECG at EOT that was considered to be clinically significant. Of the 
patients with abnormal ECG values at baseline, 3 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm demonstrated 
an abnormal ECG value at EOT; however, none of these was considered to be clinically significant. 
ECOG 
Worsening of ECOG status from baseline to any post-baseline time point occurred in 36% of patients in 
the brentuximab vedotin arm, compared with 25% in the placebo arm. In most patients, the change from 
baseline was 1 point. In 4% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm, and 1% in the placebo arm, the 
change was 2. 
Improvement in ECOG status occurred for 22% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 27% in the placebo 
arm, in all patients with 1 point. 
In order to determine the clinical relevance of the observed difference in ECOG performance status 
deterioration between treatment arms, the Applicant provided information on ECOG deterioration in 
relation to the occurrence of (S)AEs, or treatment discontinuation/ dose modifications. The majority of 
SAEs, regardless of treatment arm, were not associated with a change in ECOG PS (64% brentuximab 
vedotin vs 53% placebo). However, ECOG score deterioration appears to be associated with occurrence of 
some SAEs (23/100, 23% brentuximab vedotin; 15/36, 42% placebo). The number of treatment 
discontinuation events was comparable between the treatment arms (152 events brentuximab vedotin vs 
156 placebo). The majority of patients who discontinued treatment, regardless of treatment arm, 
experienced no change in ECOG PS. The number of patients experiencing any increase in ECOG PS was 
comparable between the treatment arms (28/156, 18% brentuximab vedotin; 23/152, 15% placebo). 
Dose modifications were more common for patients receiving brentuximab vedotin vs placebo (508 vs 
105); nevertheless, the majority of dose modifications, regardless of treatment arm, were not associated 
with a change in ECOG PS. Although some dose modifications (<10% in each treatment arm) were 
associated with an increase from baseline in ECOG PS (+1, 6% brentuximab vedotin vs 9% placebo; +2 
<1% brentuximab vedotin vs 0% placebo), no meaningful difference was observed between the 
treatment arms. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
In the pivotal study, only 8 patients were 65 years or older. No separate safety analysis has been 
performed for this subgroup.  
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 65/83 
 
  
  
 
Patients with hepatic or renal impairment were excluded from the pivotal study. No separate clinical 
studies in patients with hepatic or renal impairment have been submitted.  
Paediatric patients 
No data is available in children or adolescents under 18 years.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
It is known that brentuximab vedotin causes teratogenicity and embryo-foetal lethality in animals, and 
therefore woman should avoid pregnancy during treatment. Women of childbearing potential who enrolled 
in the pivotal study were required to have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result within 7 days 
of receiving the first dose of the study treatment, and must have agreed to use an effective method of 
contraception during the study and for 30 days after the study treatment period. This period is extended 
to 6 months after treatment with a SmPC update in 2014. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new drug interactions were evaluated in the pivotal study.  
The MAH provided data regarding drug-drug interactions with medications that are CYP3A substrates, 
already taken by patients in the pivotal study and the relation between the use of these drugs with the 
occurrence of neutropenia was explored. Patients who received brentuximab vedotin and concomitant 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 (n=20) or strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (n=1) were identified; 146 patients 
received brentuximab vedotin, but did not take any concomitant strong inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4/5. The small sample of patients receiving a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer precludes 
definitive conclusions; however, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors did not appear associated with either adverse 
events of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, nor lab values of Grade 3 or Grade 4 low neutrophils. Only 1 patient 
received both brentuximab vedotin and a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5; this patient did not experience a 
Grade 3 or 4 AE or lab value consistent with neutropenia. Receipt of a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 may 
have slightly increased the incidence of dose modifications. Of the 20 patients who received brentuximab 
vedotin and a concomitant strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, 14 patients (70%) had a dose modification 
compared with 58% (85/146) of patients who did not receive a concomitant strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. 
The 1 patient receiving a concomitant strong inducer of CYP3A4/5 had a dose modification. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation 
In the AETHERA study, treatment discontinuation could occur due to disease progression, adverse 
event(s), completion of 16 cycles of study treatment, or investigator or patient decision, similar to the 
pivotal HL Study SG035-0003. Table 31 shows time to treatment discontinuation for AETHERA patients by 
treatment arm and for Study SG035-0003.

Table 31: 
Analysis of Time to Dose Discontinuation (Safety Sets [a]) - Studies SGN35-005 
(AETHERA) and SG035-0003 (Pivotal HL) 
An AE led to treatment discontinuation for 32% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 6% in the placebo 
arm. Peripheral sensory neuropathy (14% of patients vs 1% placebo) and peripheral motor neuropathy 
(7% vs 1%) were the 2 most commonly reported AEs that led to treatment discontinuation for the 
brentuximab vedotin arm. All other AEs that led to discontinuation occurred in ≤1% of patients in both 
arms. Serious adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in two or more patients in either 
the phase 2 or the phase 3 population were peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, 
vomiting, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Paresthesia also led to discontinuation in two or more 
patients in either the phase 2 or the phase 3 population. 
Adverse events that led to dose modification

0003.

An AE led to a dose delay for 54% in the brentuximab vedotin treatment arm and 25% in the placebo 
arm. The most commonly reported AEs (≥2% of patients) that led to a dose delay for the brentuximab 
vedotin arm were neutropenia (22% of patients); peripheral sensory neuropathy (16%); upper 
respiratory tract infection and peripheral motor neuropathy (6% each); and herpes zoster and 
thrombocytopenia (2% each). 
An AE led to a dose reduction for 32% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 3% in the placebo arm. The 
most commonly reported AEs that led to dose reduction for the brentuximab vedotin arm were peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (22% of patients vs 1% on placebo) and peripheral motor neuropathy (6% vs 1%) 
with hepatotoxicity and paraesthesia reported for 2 patients each (both 1% vs 0%). 
At least 1 dose delay was reported for per-protocol reasons (i.e. AEs) in 54% of the brentuximab vedotin 
treated patients and 26% on placebo.  Overall, 9% of all doses (186/2004) in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm and 3% (56/1756) in the placebo arm were delayed for AEs. 
Dose reductions occurred at least once in 32% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm, and in 3% in 
the placebo arm. The majority of patients who had brentuximab vedotin dose reductions had the first 
dose reduction after multiple cycles of treatment at the 1.8 mg/kg dose.  Table 33 shows number of 
patients with dose modification by cycle.

Post marketing experience 
Brentuximab vedotin was first approved on 19 August 2011 in the United States and has been granted 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 68/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
marketing authorization in 45 countries. It has been authorised under conditional approval in the EU 
through a Centralised Procedure since 25 October 2012.  
Up to 19 August 2014, the cumulative estimated patient exposure to brentuximab vedotin is 14,614 
patients, including 2382 subjects from company- and investigator-sponsored clinical trials, 2399 patients 
from the Named Patient Program, 53 patients from the Special Access Program, 36 patient from the 
compassionate-use program, and approximately 9744 patients from the post marketing setting. 
The previously established favourable efficacy has not changed. Review of the serious adverse events 
reported for brentuximab vedotin post-marketing during interval period of the last PSUR (20 February 
2014 – 19 August 2014) showed the main areas of concern SOCs General disorders and administration 
site conditions, followed by Nervous system disorders. The safety profile of the marketing experience on 
adverse event level in the monotherapy setting is considered to be in line with the safety profile as 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Data from study SGN35-016 (a phase 1/2 study in which the safety and efficacy of the use of 
brentuximab vedotin in combination with bendamustine was investigated), a higher incidence and greater 
severity of infusion related reactions was observed compared to the results of the monotherapy pivotal 
trials. The risk of infusion related reactions will be closely monitored by the MAH and discussed in future 
PSURs. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure 
The safety analysis set of the pivotal trial is considered sufficient, although information concerning 
uncommon adverse events may be limited. Since this is the first brentuximab vedotin pivotal trial with a 
comparator arm, the trial did, however, allow for more precise evaluation of treatment-related adverse 
events as compared with the previous single arm registration trials. 
A high number of dose modifications was observed in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared with 
placebo, and with the registration phase II trials. In the AETHERA trial, 54% of patients in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm experienced a dose delay (vs 26% placebo) and 32% a dose reduction (vs 3% 
placebo). Exposure-adjusted analyses did not reveal a clear association between the number of 
brentuximab vedotin cycles and the number of adverse events within the pivotal study. The median 
relative dose intensity was >95% in both arms, indicating that patients were able to receive the planned 
doses of study treatment. 
Patients in both AETHERA study arms experienced a similar median time to discontinuation that was 
longer than that experienced by patients treated on pivotal HL Study SG035-0003. This difference is due 
in large part to treatment discontinuation prior to receipt of 16 cycles due to disease progression (45/102, 
44% of G035-0003 patients) and adverse events (20/102, 19.6%) in these heavily pretreated patients 
with active disease at the start of the study. Not all patients in the current study had active disease, 42% 
had achieved CR as best response with the most recent prior salvage therapy, 34% PR, and 24% stable 
disease. In addition, 35% of patients were PET FDG-avid prior to ASCT, and 34% was PET FDG-negative. 
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
As expected, higher percentages of AEs (98% vs 89%), treatment-related AEs (88% vs 49%), SAEs 
(25% vs 13%) and discontinuation due to AEs (32% vs 6%) were observed in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm compared with placebo. The type of AEs in the pivotal trial was comparable with the phase II HL and 
sALCL patient population, though frequencies were higher. The latter is likely due to the higher median 
number of treatment cycles received in the AETHERA trial (15, compared with 6-9 in the previous two 
phase II studies). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 69/83 
 
  
  
The most frequent observed treatment-related AEs occurring more frequently with brentuximab vedotin 
treatment compared to placebo were: peripheral sensory (54% vs 14% placebo) and motor (23% vs 2%) 
neuropathy, neutropenia (32% vs 9%), nausea (16% vs 4%), fatigue (13% vs 9%), diarrhoea (10% vs 
3%), arthralgia and vomiting (both 10% vs 1%). The distribution over the different grades of AEs was 
comparable with the known safety profile in the phase II HL and sALCL patient population, most AEs 
being grade 2 or 3 in severity. A higher number of grade 5 TEAEs was reported in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm (n=5) compared with the placebo arm (n=2). TEAEs that had a higher risk of occurring in 
patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm than patients in the placebo arm and have changed frequency 
from common to very common are peripheral motor neuropathy, constipation, upper respiratory 
infection, arthralgia, chills.  New ADRs that have been included following analysis of the safety database 
were decreased weight (very common) and abdominal pain (very common). 
Among the separate risk groups the incidence of AEs was comparable indicating that compared to 
patients with 2 or more risk factors, the subgroup of patients with only 1 risk factor is equally exposed to 
the risk of experiencing adverse events, while benefitting less from the brentuximab vedotin treatment 
(the latter as concluded in the efficacy part of this report).  
The frequency of SAEs with brentuximab vedotin treatment was higher compared with placebo (25% vs 
13%), but lower compared with known safety data in the phase II HL and sALCL patient population 
(31%). Only pyrexia and vomiting were observed with >2% difference between the brentuximab vedotin 
and placebo arm, although the frequency in the brentuximab vedotin arm was still low (4 and 3%, 
respectively). Serious adverse drug reactions in the phase 2 and the phase 3 population were: 
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, headache, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, constipation, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, pyrexia, peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
hyperglycaemia, demyelinating polyneuropathy, tumour lysis syndrome and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 
Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 19% and 32% of patients receiving brentuximab 
vedotin in the phase 2 and the phase 3 population, respectively. Serious adverse reactions that led to 
treatment discontinuation in two or more patients in either the phase 2 or the phase 3 population were 
peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, vomiting, and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome. Paresthesia also led to discontinuation in two or more patients in either the phase 2 or the 
phase 3 population. 
The total number of deaths was similar in both arms (16%). Slightly more patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm (n=5: 2 ARDS; MDS, cardiac arrest and bladder cancer 1 each) compared with placebo 
(n=3: MDS, aplastic anaemia and fungal pneumonia) died before they experienced disease progression. 
In the two cases with ARDS reported as the cause of death, one (pneumonitis) was considered treatment-
related.  
Among the AEs of special interest, no new safety signals were observed. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
The frequency of peripheral sensory (56%) and motor neuropathy (23%) were higher compared with 
previously observed frequencies (44% and <10%, respectively). Peripheral neuropathy was typically 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and managed with dose reductions and delays, and complete resolution or 
improvement occurred in 73% of patients. In the phase 3 population, at the time of last evaluation, the 
majority of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (85%) had improvement or resolution of their 
peripheral neuropathy symptoms. For patients who reported peripheral neuropathy, brentuximab vedotin 
treatment discontinuation occurred in 23%, dose reductions were reported in 29%, and dose delays 
occurred in 22% of patients compared with known safety data from the phase II HL and sALCL patient 
population (8%, 13% and 9% respectively), again likely due to a difference in treatment duration.  
Pulmonary toxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 70/83 
 
  
  
 
 
Data from non-clinical single- and repeat-dose toxicology studies demonstrate that the lung is not a 
primary target organ of toxicity of brentuximab vedotin. The risk of pulmonary toxicity associated with 
the concomitant use of brentuximab vedotin and bleomycin was identified in clinical studies, and the 
combination is listed as a Contraindication in the SmPC and as an Identified Risk in the EU-RMP. 
However, cases of pulmonary toxicity in patients not receiving concomitant bleomycin have been reported 
in patients receiving brentuximab vedotin as well. Cases of pulmonary toxicity including acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ADRS) and pneumonitis some with fatal outcomes, have been reported (SmPC section 
4.4)  
Haematological cell toxicity 
Infections 
Overall the frequency of infections was similar as previously reported (60% brentuximab vedotin arm 
phase III AETHERA study, 58% in previous phase II studies). As expected with brentuximab vedotin 
treatment, upper respiratory tract infection was the most common reported TEAE in the infection SOC. No 
events of bacteraemia, sepsis, or septic shock were reported in the brentuximab vedotin arm. Serious 
infections and opportunistic infections were very common in patients treated with this medicine (see 
section 4.4). In the phase 2 and the phase 3 population, the most commonly reported opportunistic 
infections were herpes zoster and herpes simplex. 
The imbalance in opportunistic infections is mostly caused by herpes zoster and simplex infections. 
Herpes Zoster is a known common AE of brentuximab vedotin. SmPC section 4.8 has been updated to 
include herpes simplex infections. The majority of opportunistic infections reported in patients treated 
with brentuximab vedotin have been non-serious and considered manageable.  
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
Microscopic effects in bone marrow correlated with anaemia and leukopenia (primarily neutropenia) and 
thrombocytopenia in repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys and rats dosed with brentuximab vedotin 
(see EPAR). Consistent with the nonclinical toxicology results, neutropenia is a common ADR (35% 
brentuximab vedotin vs 12% placebo). Frequencies were higher compared with the phase II HL and 
sALCL population (TEAE in 21%, grade 3 in 7-13%), likely explained by the higher number of treatment 
cycles in the pivotal AETHERA trial. Nevertheless, neutropenia appeared to be well managed with the 
protocol-specified recommendations for haematologic toxicity (i.e., dose delay, growth factor support). 
Thromboctypenia and anaemia occurred less frequently (7% and 8% in the brentuximab vedotin arm) 
than neutropenia. Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia was not shown to be associated with bleeding events. 
Thrombocytopenia is the only hematologic AE resulting in treatment discontinuation in this study, and 
occurred in 1 patient from each treatment group. None of the hematologic AEs led to dose reduction. 
ADA and immunological events  
Similar percentages of patients were ADA positive at any post-baseline visit in the two treatment arms 
(32-35%), although higher titers were observed with brentuximab vedotin treatment as compared to 
placebo. It is reassuring that lower percentages of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm were 
persistently positive post-baseline (8%) as compared to the placebo arm (12%), and that the overall 
incidence of (more severe) AEs did not appear to be higher in persistently ADA-positive patients relative 
to transiently ADA-positive or never positive patients. However, IRRs were observed more frequently and 
were more severe in patients with ADAs (90% (9/10) of persistently ADA positive patients).  
IRRs occur very commonly in patients treated with brentuximab vedotin, and frequencies in the AETHERA 
study (15%) were in line with known frequencies in the phase II HL and sALCL populations (11%). 
Currently premedication is only administered in patients with prior infusion-related reactions. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 71/83 
 
  
  
 
majority of events have been non-serious and the included safety information in the SmPC section 4.4 is 
considered sufficient.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No paediatric data are available. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, no new safety concerns have been identified with brentuximab vedotin treatment of HL patients 
at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. Frequencies of several known ADRs, as well as 
of treatment discontinuation due to AEs, dose delays and dose reductions appeared higher than what is 
previously known from brentuximab vedotin treatment, likely attributed to the longer treatment duration. 
Among the separate risk groups, the incidence of adverse events was comparable. The safety profile was 
consistent with the known safety information from brentuximab vedotin in the previous approved HL and 
sALCL indications. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 19/02/2016.  
The Annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  5.2  (dated  23  February  2015)  is  acceptable.  However,  the 
applicant was requested to remove “safety in patients with hepatic and renal impairment” from the list of 
missing 
information,  based  on  the  results  of  study  SGN35-008,  submitted  under  variation 
EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0012.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  was  required  to  provide  a  justification  for

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
To support the current variation, one phase III, randomised, double blind, and placebo-controlled pivotal 
study, the AETHERA trial, was submitted. The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was met, i.e. a 
statistically significant PFS improvement of median 18.8 months (42.9 months vs. 24.1 months placebo; 
HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, IRF analysis) for patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared with 
placebo. The primary efficacy results were supported by several PFS sensitivity and subgroup analyses, 
all showing benefit of brentuximab vedotin treatment, except for a small subgroup of patients ≥65 years 
of age (n=8). The observation that 94% of PFS events occurred within 25 months after randomization 
suggests that the majority of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm in whom no PFS event has 
occurred are cured. 
The PFS subgroup analyses indicated efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients with CR as well as active 
disease, and in patients with ≥1, ≥2, and ≥3 risk factors for progressive disease, which is reassuring. PFS 
benefit at fixed time points is observed in the group of brentuximab vedotin-treated patients with ≥2 risk 
factors (in particular at the plateau phase of the KM curves), whereas no benefit was observed in patients 
with only 1 risk factor group. These observations are supported by the results from the PFS HR analyses.  
In the analysis of the secondary OS endpoint, no beneficial effect of brentuximab vedotin  compared 
with placebo was observed, where the median OS was not reached; the estimated 24 month OS rate 
was 88% with brentuximab vedotin  vs 89% with placebo; HR 1.15. OS did not show a difference 
between the treatment arms for the patient groups with 2 or ≥3 risk factors.  
The exploratory endpoints for QoL generally did not exceed the minimally important difference. 
However, data for medical resource utilisation (MRU) seems to show lower values for brentuximab 
vedotin compared to placebo. 
The data from time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) analyses showed that brentuximab vedotin can postpone 
the time to first subsequent treatment in the ITT population (~3.7 months) and cause a small decrease 
in number of subsequent treatments in patients with 2 or more risk factors (~12%). 
The results of the variants of the time to treatment failure analyses strengthen the conclusion that 
brentuximab vedotin brings clinical benefit.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The substantial gain in PFS in the brentuximab vedotin treatment arm over the placebo group did not 
result in a gain in OS, as it would have been expected. The reason for this discrepancy in unknown, but a 
possibility could be that it is due to the cross-over of placebo patients once they progressed. The mature 
OS results are expected in 2020 and hence, the CHMP has recommended the MAH to submit the final OS 
data in 2020. Furthermore, no improvement in QoL in the overall population and in patients with 2 or ≥3 
risk factors was observed.  
The PFS improvement is supported by several sensitivity and subgroup analyses. However, it seems as if 
most PFS benefit is obtained in approximately the first 6 months after start of treatment, considering the 
rapid increase in events in the placebo arm in this period and the less steep part of the PFS KM 
curve/plateau phase in both study arms thereafter. This may indicate the existence of a subgroup of 
patients, likely those at risk for early disease relapse, that experience a larger treatment effect on PFS of 
brentuximab vedotin treatment. During the assessment, post hoc subset analyses using 5 risk factors 
showed that there was no benefit observed in patients with 1 risk factor compared with patients with 2 
and 3 risk factors. The reason for this finding is unclear, but it is plausible that the number of patients in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 77/83 
 
  
  
the 1 risk factor group was limited, i.e. 21 patients vs. 28 patients on placebo, hampering any definitive 
conclusion.  
The PFS analyses showed a consistent trend towards benefit for patients who received brentuximab 
vedotin compared with patients who received placebo with the exception of patients ≥ 65 years of age 
(n=8). Few patients ≥ 65 years of age (n=8) were included, hence, no final conclusions regarding 
efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in this subgroup. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new safety signals have been observed. A higher percentages of AEs (98% vs 89%), treatment 
related AEs (88% vs 49%), SAEs (25% vs 13%) and discontinuation due to AEs (32% vs 6%) were 
observed in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared with the placebo study group.  
The most frequent observed treatment related AEs occurring more frequently with brentuximab vedotin  
treatment compared with placebo were: peripheral sensory (54% vs 14% placebo) and motor (23% vs 
2%) neuropathy, neutropenia (32% vs 9%), nausea (16% vs 4%), fatigue (13% vs 9%), diarrhoea (10% 
vs 3%), arthralgia and vomiting (both 10% vs 1%). 
The frequency of SAEs with brentuximab vedotin treatment was also higher compared with placebo (25% 
vs 13%). Only pyrexia and vomiting were observed with >2% difference between the brentuximab 
vedotin and placebo arm, although the frequency in the brentuximab vedotin arm was still low (4% and 
3%, respectively). 
Treatment discontinuation (primarily due to peripheral neuropathy) (32% brentuximab vedotin vs 6% 
placebo), dose delays (54% vs 25%) and dose reductions (32% vs 3%) due to AEs all occurred more 
frequently in the in the brentuximab vedotin arm.  
Among the separate risk groups, i.e. 1 risk factor, 2 risk factor or ≥3 risk factors, the incidence of 
adverse events was comparable. 
The total number of deaths was similar in both arms (16%).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal trial, a slight imbalance in pulmonary toxicity events (5% brentuximab vedotin vs 3% 
placebo) has been observed, with pneumonitis being the most common observed event in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm (2%). In addition, two deaths due to ARDS have been observed in the pivotal 
trial, one of which was considered treatment-related. Similar to previous evaluations of brentuximab 
vedotin, the risk of pulmonary toxicity due to brentuximab vedotin treatment could not be ruled out, 
although additional measures are not deemed necessary at this time. The risk of pulmonary toxicity is 
included in the RMP as an important identified risk.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
For patients at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT, a PFS difference (~30%) between 
the study arms at 24 and 36 months represent a clinically relevant difference.  Sensitivity analyses 
support the primary endpoint. Most of the improvement is observed within the first 6 months which then 
plateaus in both study arms. The presence of 2 or ≥3 risk factors conferred the population which 
benefited the most. Patients with 1 risk factor showed no benefit from the treatment. There is also 
evidence that brentuximab vedotin slightly reduces the number of subsequent therapies, delays the first 
and perhaps the second next line of treatment and reduces the need for allogeneic SCT, although it 
should be considered that this is in relation to the placebo group where no active treatment has been 
given yet. .  
However, it is of concern is that despite this substantial improvement in PFS, a clinical benefit in terms of 
increased OS in the early treatment following ASCT for patients at increased risk of relapse or progression 
was not demonstrated neither for the total study population, nor for the patient groups with 2 or ≥3 risk 
factors. The same applies to the effect on QoL. This would suggest that there is a lack of sustained clinical 
benefit for patients who start brentuximab vedotin treatment before disease progression or relapse 
compared to observation. 
No new safety concerns were raised. Most adverse events were non-serious and manageable, but still a 
high frequency of treatment related AEs (88%, including 54% peripheral neuropathy), SAEs (25%), and 
even a (very small) risk of death in the brentuximab vedotin treatment arm was observed. The majority 
of patients had improvement or resolution of the peripheral neuropathy symptoms. The longer duration of 
the brentuximab vedotin treatment as compared to the indication of treatment of patients following 
relapse is likely to explain the higher frequencies of several known AEs, as well as of treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs, dose delays and dose reductions. Therefore, the risks are known and 
manageable by recommendations in the SmPC and risk minimisation activities in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the benefits of brentuximab vedotin in terms of increase in PFS in patients with 
HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT outweighs the risk, at least in patients with 
at least two risk factors. This will be further discussed below. The side-effects are considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance is positive.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655943/2016 
Page 80/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The current standard of care for patients with HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following 
ASCT is the “watchful waiting” approach where patients are treated once they have disease progression 
or relapse. Most patients with relapsed or refractory HL who are not cured by ASCT will eventually die of 
their lymphoma. For patients who relapse or progress after ASCT generally occurs early; approximately 
71% of relapse/progression events occur within 1 year post-ASCT and 90% within 2 years post ASCT. 
Historical outcomes for the approximately 50% of patients experiencing progressive disease post-ASCT 
are extremely poor, with a median post-progression survival of 1.3 years, and a 5-year survival rate of 
20% or less. No established system of risk factors systematically guides clinicians to identify patients at 
risk of relapse or progression post-ASCT. It is accepted that multiple risk factors are considered when 
treating physicians evaluate HL patients following ASCT for the risk of relapse, comparable to those 
criteria identified in the pivotal trial. Hence, there is a need for new therapies for patients with relapsed or 
refractory HL and for those who may be at risk of disease progression post-ASCT.  
Brentuximab vedotin current indication includes patients that have relapsed/progressed after ASCT. The 
MAH proposes to extend this indication to treatment of patients at an earlier stage post-ASCT treatment 
for patients at increased risk  of progression. This approach may offer a chance of eradicating any 
residual lymphoma after ASCT. A clear and relevant clinical benefit in terms of PFS was observed in 
patients with at least 2 risk factors. This patient population is at an increased risk of progression and 
early treatment with brentuximab has shown that it delayed subsequent more aggressive treatments with 
higher toxicity, with a small decrease in the number of subsequent treatments. This in itself, as 
suggested by the SAG-O experts, is considered a relevant clinical benefit for patients. It is somewhat of a 
concern that the observed PFS improvement did not translate into an improvement in OS, an objective 
and undisputable clinical benefit for patients. The lack of OS benefit could be explained by the limited 
number of events that have occurred thus far and the high frequency of cross-over to brentuximab 
vedotin (44% of patients) in the placebo arm. The high OS rate at 24 months (88%, although similar 
between treatment arms) does indicate that next line therapy is still successful with no detrimental effect 
after brentuximab vedotin treatment, which is reassuring. Moreover, the data seems also to suggest that 
those patients who experience prolonged remissions in the experimental arm could potentially be cured in 
the long term. Although QoL was not affected, a trend towards lower medical resource utilisation was also 
observed. Considering the poor prognosis in patients with high risk factors, the CHMP considers that a 
positive benefit risk balance for maintenance treatment with brentixumab vedotin in the high risk patient 
subgroup has been established.

Extension of Indication to include the treatment of adult patients with Hodgkin Lymphona (HL) at 
increased risk of relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and the 
RMP (v.6.3) are updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Moreover, on the basis of the assessment performed by the CHMP concerning the extension of indication 
of Adcetris for the treatment of adult patients with Hodgkin Lymphona at increased risk of relapse or 
progression following autologous stem cell transplantation, contained in Annex IV, the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the extension of indication presents a significant clinical benefit as referred to in Article 14 
(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following conditions:

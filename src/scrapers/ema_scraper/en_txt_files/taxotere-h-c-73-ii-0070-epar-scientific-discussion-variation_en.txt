Following a change of policy the EMEA now publishes the full scientific discussion for Extension of Indication 
procedures (after removal of any commercially confidential information). For that reason, the information 
published for recent applications for a particular medicinal product may now be more detailed than what was 
published for applications in the past.

Introduction 
Taxotere 20 and 80 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion (INN: docetaxel) were first 
granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) under exceptional circumstances for a restricted indication 
(second line monotherapeutic treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer after anthracycline 
failure) in the EU in 1995. Docetaxel is, just like paclitaxel, an important taxane, which displays its 
cytotoxic/antineoplastic activity by promoting the assembly of free tubulin into stable microtubles. 
Meanwhile, after the granting of the full MA and several amendments of the indication, the licensed 
therapeutic indications are: 
“Breast cancer 
 - in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for the adjuvant treatment of patients with 
operable node-positive breast cancer. 
-  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. 
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after 
failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline  or  an 
alkylating agent. 
- in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose 
tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
- in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous  therapy  should  have  included  an 
anthracycline. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. 
- in combination with cisplatin  for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for 
this condition. 
Prostate cancer 
- in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of patients with hormone 
refractory metastatic prostate cancer. 
Gastric Adenocarcinoma 
- in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric 
adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received 
prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.” 
In April 2000, the MAH submitted a type II variation (EMEA/H/C/073/II/25) to extend the indication 
to: “induction treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of 
the head and neck (Stage III or IV) with good performance status”.  
The submission was withdrawn in July 2001, after a negative CHMP opinion. The grounds for refusal 
were as follows:

-  The  submitted  documentation  included  only  limited  data  from  phase  I/II  studies  with 
docetaxel  in  a  small  and  heterogeneous  patient  population  treated  according  to  various 
regimens and modalities.  
-  The  results  provided  did  not  establish  outstanding  activity  of  the  combination  regimen 
including docetaxel. A high variability in the 2-year overall survival (OS) results was noted in 
the  documentation  submitted  so  that  a  claim  of  outstanding  activity  for  the  docetaxel- 
containing regimen could not be established with respect to OS. The high variability observed 
in  the  submitted  Phase  I/II  studies  underlines  the  need  for  a  Phase  III  study  for  a  reliable 
evaluation of efficacy. 
-  The  docetaxel/5FU/cisplatin  regimen  appeared 
5FU/cisplatin and this underscored the need for more convincing efficacy data.

toxic 
than 
In  March  2006,  the  MAH  submitted  a  new  type  II  variation  application  (EMEA/H/C/073/II/70), 
thereby amending the proposed indication into “TAXOTERE (docetaxel) in combination with cisplatin 
and  5-fluorouracil  is  indicated  for  the  induction  treatment  of  patients  with  inoperable  locally 
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.” 
Proposed posology: 
“For  the  induction  treatment  of  inoperable  locally  advanced  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  head 
neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of TAXOTERE is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by 
cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at 750 
mg/m2  per  day  for  five  days.    This  regimen  is  administered  every  3  weeks  for  4  cycles.    Following 
chemotherapy,  patients  should  receive  radiotherapy.    Patients  must  receive  premedication  with 
antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after cisplatin administration).  Prophylaxis for 
neutropenic infections should be administered.   
For  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil  dose  modifications,  see  manufacturer’s  summary  of  product 
characteristic” 
This second submission is supported by a phase III study, TAX 323, comparing induction treatment 
with  Docetaxel  plus  Cisplatin  plus  5-Fluorouracil  (TPF)  to  treatment  with  Cisplatin  plus  5-
Fluorouracil (PF) alone. Both arms were followed by radiotherapy treatment. 
Head and neck (H&N) cancer is a group of cancers, in the same anatomical region (comprising 
cancers of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, pharynx and larynx) with roughly similar histology, aetiology, 
treatment options and prognostic variables. H&N cancers represent 5% of newly diagnosed cancers in 
adult patients. Worldwide, more than 500 000 new cases are projected annually. In 2002, the estimated 
incidence in Europe alone was around 143 000, with over 68 000 deaths. Tobacco and alcohol (abuse) 
are major contributors to the development of H&N cancers.  
The main histological subtype within H&N cancers is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 
The Tumour- Node- Metastasis (TNM) staging system is the best prognostic system for locally 
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the H&N (SCCHN). It is an indicator of resectability, a good 
prognostic factor for efficacy of radiotherapy, and therefore of survival. 
The survival of patients with H&N cancers depends on a number of factors, the most important being 
disease stage and patient performance status. Generally, patients with early-stage disease (stage I or II) 
can be treated effectively with surgery with or without radiotherapy (RT), or with RT alone; 5-year 
survival rates are in the region of 60% to 90%. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, 2/3 of the 
patients have an advanced locoregional disease (stage III or IV), with a far worse prognosis resulting 
in 5-year survival rates of 60% to less than 4%. Stage III is defined as T3 N0 M0 or T1-3 N1 M0. 
Stage IV is defined as T4 N0-1 M0 or T1-4 N2-3 M0 or any T any N M1. Local disease is often 
associated with pain, mutilation, and functional/nutritional problems, which severely impair the 
quality of life of the patient. 
SCCHN is generally considered as irresectable if all gross tumor cannot be removed on anatomic 
grounds or if local control cannot be achieved after an operation. For patients with a performance 
status (PS) of 0 or 1, the standard treatment for newly diagnosed but irresectable disease is concurrent

platinum based chemotherapy with radiotherapy (i.e. chemoradiotherapy (CRT)). However CRT is 
associated with a substantial increase in toxicity. 
The value of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy has been confirmed in the meta-analyse by Bourhis 
et al. 2004. Data showed that among 87 trials, a benefit was confined mainly to the use of concurrent 
CRT, which was shown to give an 8% survival advantage at 5 years. The benefit was greater when a 
platinum based chemotherapy was used (11% survival advantage at 5 years).  
The total dose and fractionation are important factors in determining outcome of RT. “Standard-of-
care” RT for subjects with locally advanced head and neck malignancies is still evolving. 
Improvements in radiation technology, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), offer the 
possibility to spare the salivary glands from the radiation effects and then to reduce acute and late 
toxicities, such as xerostomia. This emergent new technique does not need the administration of a 
radioprotectant agent. Despite the growing use of IMRT, this technique is not yet available in all 
radiotherapy centers. Likewise, altered fractionation radiation schedules have enabled the delivery of 
intensified doses of radiotherapy with improved locoregional disease control. However, this approach 
is generally associated with an increase in the incidence of acute grade 3/4 side effects. 
The role of induction chemotherapy, i.e. neoadjuvant therapy, in the treatment of locally advanced 
SCCHN remains controversial despite evidence that integrating chemotherapy into the treatment plan 
of locally advanced disease can lead to organ preservation and improved survival of patients with 
resectable and irresectable disease. The results of a meta-analysis by Pignon et al (Lancet 2000) 
showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy by cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (PF) prior to surgery improves the 
local control and has a small non-significant impact on survival in patients with SCCHN. 
Phase II trials investigating induction chemotherapy with docetaxel associated to cisplatin/5-FU 
(TPF), have reported promising results in terms of high response rate and survival. However, these 
expectations needed further investigation in well-defined controlled trials.  
With reference to the current variation, the pivotal randomised phase III study, XRP6976F-
323/EORTC 2971 (EFC6042), compared induction chemotherapy treatment with TPF to treatment 
with PF in an effort to improve local control in patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN. 
With reference to other treatment options in the field of SCCHN, photodynamic therapy with Foscan 
(temoporfin) received a positive opinion by the CHMP in 2001, for the palliative treatment of patients 
with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma failing prior therapies and unsuitable for 
radiotherapy, surgery or systemic chemotherapy.  
In August 2002, the Marketing Authorisation Application for Intradose (cisplatin/adrenaline) (Maxim 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd) for the treatment of recurrent or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck in patients who are not considered candidates for surgery or radiotherapy, was withdrawn. 
In February 2006, the CHMP gave a positive opinion for Erbitux, molecular targeted therapy, in 
combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell 
cancer of the head and neck.

Clinical Efficacy  
Phase I/II studies  
Study Tax017HN 
The Tax017HN trial was a phase I/II, multicenter European study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 
Taxotere,  cisplatin  and  5-FU  in  locally  advanced  previously  untreated  HNSCC.  Taxotere  75  mg/m² 
was administered with cisplatin 75 mg/m² (dose level I) or 100 mg/m² (dose level II) and 5-FU 750 
mg/m²/day  for  5  days,  every  3  weeks.  48  patients  were  enrolled  between  September  1997  and 
September 1999, 25 in the arm receiveing dose level I and 23 in the dose level II arm. All patients had 
stage  III  or  IV  disease  without  evidence  of  distant  metastasis  (M0)  and  had  Eastern  Cooperative 
Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  0  or  1  (31.1%  and  68.8%,  respectively).  The  most 
prevalent  tumour  primary  site  was  hypopharynx  (35.4%).  Treatments  were  administered  at  planned 
dose (90%) and without delay in a majority of cycles (92.4%). The median relative dose intensity was 
0.98.  Prophylactic antibiotics were administered in 43% of patients receiving dose level I and in 70% 
of patients receiving dose level II. 
Evaluation  of  response  was  performed  using  CT-scan  and  MRI  assessments  reviewed  by  an 
independent expert panel. The Overall Response Rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat population was 64% 
at  dose  Level  I  and  78.3%  at  Dose  Level  II.  No  patients  had  complete  response.  No  biopsies  were 
performed.  Median  survival  was  18.5  months  and  Progression Free  Survival  (PFS)  was  6.9  months. 
One-year survival in the group receiving dose level I was 56% and was not reached in dose level II. 
One-year-survival for the overall population was 68.7% and the 2-year-survival rate was 42%.  
Dose level I (T75/P75/F750) was selected for further evaluation in the phase III trial TAX 323, since 
the  efficacy  was  comparable  and  the  safety  profile  better  as  compared  to  dose  level  II 
(T75/P100/F750).  
Study Tax708 
Tax708  was  a  phase  I/II,  multicentre  US  based  study  of  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  with  docetaxel, 
cisplatin and 5 -FU in curative treatment of HNSCC. In the previous application in 2000, this study 
was presented as the pivotal trial. 
Docetaxel 75 mg/m² was administered with cisplatin 75 mg/m² (dose level I) or 100 mg/m² (dose level 
II)  and  5-FU  1000  mg/m²/day  for  4  days.  43  patients  were  enrolled  between  February  1998  and 
October 1999, 13 in dose level I and 30 in dose level II. 12 out of 13 patients treated at dose level I 
received  ciprofloxacin  at  all  3  cycles.  23  out  of  30  patients  at  dose  level  II  were  treated  with  oral 
ciprofloxacin prophylactically during the first cycle and 20 during the second and third cycles. 
The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  complete  responses,  overall  response  rate  and 
pathological responses. 
All  patients  had  stage  III  or  IV  disease  without  evidence  of  distant  metastasis  (M0)  and had  ECOG 
performance  status  0  or  1  (65.1%  and  34.9%,  respectively).  A  majority  of  patients  (51.2%)  had 
oropharynx tumour as primary site tumour. Treatments were administered at the planned dose (84.9%) 
and without delay in a majority of cycles (90.5%). The median relative dose intensity was 0.98. 
In the intent-to-treat population, there were 6 patients (46.2%) with complete response (CR) (95% CI 
(confidence  interval):  19.2%  -  74.9%)  among  patients  treated  with  dose  level  I  and  11  patients 
(36.7%) with CRs (95% CI: 19.9% - 56.1%) among those treated at dose level II.  
The overall response rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat population was 84.6% at dose level I and 96.7% 
at dose level II. Median survival and progression free survival (PFS) had not yet been reached at the 
time of the submission. The one-year survival rate for the overall population was 97% and the 2-year 
survival rate (cut-off date of 15 August 2000) was 82%.

Because the efficacy and safety profiles of dose level II (T75/P100/F1000) were considered better than 
those of dose level I, dose level II was selected for evaluation in the randomized comparative phase III 
trial TAX 324. 
Phase III study - TAX323 
Methods 
First  patient  was  randomised  on  14  April  1999;  clinical  cut-off  date  for  progression-free  survival 
(PFS) was 21 September 2003. The study was conducted by the Sponsor (Aventis Pharma, now part of 
the Sanofi-Aventis Group) in cooperation with the European Organization for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (EORTC). 
Objectives  
Primary 
To  compare  the  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  in  2  groups  of  subjects  with  locally  advanced 
inoperable Squamous Cell Carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN): 
- docetaxel plus cisplatin plus 5-FU (TPF- test group) followed by locoregional radiation therapy. 
- cisplatin plus 5-FU (PF – control group) followed by locoregional radiation therapy. 
Secondary 
To evaluate and compare response rates before and after radiation therapy, local symptoms, duration 
of response, time to treatment failure, survival, toxicity and the quality of life (QOL) between the test 
group and the control group. 
Study Design 
TAX323  is  a  multicenter,  non-blinded,  randomized,  stratified,  phase  III  study  comparing  2 
combination  therapy  regimens  as  induction  treatment  before  radiotherapy  for  locally  advanced, 
inoperable SCCHN. Patients were randomized to receive either the triple test therapy (TPF) or control 
treatment (PF) followed by locoregional radiotherapy in both groups.  
Randomization  was  stratified  upon  2  factors:  the  primary  tumor  site  (oral  cavity  versus  oropharynx 
versus hypopharynx versus larynx) and the center (i.e. institution).

• At any time if suspicion of disease progression. 
Protocol amendments 
Three protocol amendments were performed: 
- Amendment 1 - August 1999: Modification/clarification of the study design and conduct of the study 
which did not affect the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
-  Amendment  2    -  October  2000:  Specification  of  criteria  for  inoperability  and  cancellation  of  the 
external review of response. 
- Amendment 3 - April 2001: Modification of criteria for inoperability and conduct of the study not 
affecting the SAP. 
Study Participants 
The main inclusion criteria were: 
-Inoperable  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  head  and  neck  (excluding  nasopharynx,  nasal  and 
paranasal cavities); 
-Uni- or bidimensionally measurable disease; 
- Stage III or IV, M0 (without metastases) ; 
- No previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery; 
- Age 18 to 70; 
- WHO performance status of 0 or 1; 
 -Adequate renal, liver, and hematological function. 
Treatment regimen 
Chemotherapy: 
Test group (TPF): Taxotere 75 mg/m2, as a one-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion, followed by cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, administered as a one-hour i.v. infusion on Day 1. 5-FU was administered after cisplatin as 
a continuous i.v. infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. 
Control group (PF): Cisplatin 100 mg/m2, administered as a one-hour i.v. infusion on Day 1, followed 
by continuous i.v. infusion of 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. 
Patients  were  to  receive  4 cycles  of  chemotherapy  at  3-week  intervals  unless  progression  of  disease 
(PD) or unacceptable toxicity occurred, or the patient refused treatment.  
Radiotherapy:  
In  the  absence  of  progressive  disease,  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  should  receive  7  weeks  of 
radiation  therapy  following  chemotherapy  (irrespective  of  whether  they  completed  or  discontinued 
chemotherapy) with a minimum interval of 4 weeks and no later than 7 weeks after start  of the last 
cycle (day 28 to day 49 of last cycle).  
The  irradiated  volumes  include  the  primary  site  and  both  sides  of  the  neck.  Radiation  should  be 
delivered using either a conventional fractionation (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy, 1x/day, five days per week - total 
dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (2 times a day, 
with a minimum inter-fraction interval of 6 hours, five days per week, scheme at the discretion of the 
center  -  up  to  a  total  of  maximum  70  Gy  for  accelerated  regimens  and  of  maximum  74  Gy  for 
hyperfractionated schemes). Each institution will commit itself to treat all subjects with one of these 
regimens (conventional or hyperfractionated) prior to study start.  
Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy are both integral part of the study treatment.

Surgery: 
Neck  dissection  between  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy  and  surgery  for  residual  disease  after 
radiotherapy were performed at the discretion of the local multidisciplinary team. 
Subjects with progressive disease were treated according to the standard of care of each participating 
center and were followed for survival. 
Premedication:  
⋅ TPF arm: dexamethasone 8 mg bid (D1 to 3) and ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid (D5 to15). 
⋅ Both arms: antiemetics; G-CSF secondary prophylaxis allowed. 
All patients were to be followed in the study until documentation of death. 
Comparator: 
Study TAX323 used Cisplatin (100 mg/m2) plus 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2) as control arm.  
Endpoints 
Primary: Progression-free survival (PFS).  
Secondary:    Overall  survival  (OS),  Overall  response  rate  (ORR),  Duration  of  response,  Time  to 
treatment failure (TTF). 
PFS - was calculated from the date of randomization until the date of progression or death (regardless 
of the reason for death), whichever occurred first. If progression or death did not occur before the cut-
off date (or occurred after the cut-off date), the patient was censored at the last valid assessment date 
before the cut-off date (at the cut-off date otherwise). 
OS - was measured from the date of randomization until death (regardless of the reason for death). If 
death or last contact did not occur before the cut-off date, the patient was censored at the cut-off date, 
or the last contact date if the patient was lost to follow-up before the cut-off date. 
RR  -  is  defined  for  each  treatment  group  as  the  percentage  of  patients  in  the  group  who  achieve  a 
complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) according to WHO criteria. Responses calculated 
by  the  study  coordinator  at  the  end  of  the  induction  chemotherapy  and  after  the  administration  of 
radiation therapy were used in the analyses. 
The duration of overall response (PR + CR) was calculated from the date of randomization up to the 
documentation of progression in the responders for the whole treatment (induction chemotherapy plus 
radiotherapy). If progression or death did not occur before the cut-off date/further anti-cancer therapy 
date  (or  occurred  after  the  cut-off  date),  the  patient  was  censored  at  the  last  valid  assessment  date 
before the cut-off date/further anti-cancer therapy date (at the cut-off date otherwise). 
TTF - was calculated from the date of randomization up to the date of failure (progression, relapse, 
death, discontinuation of study treatment [chemotherapy or radiotherapy] due to AE, patient refusal of 
chemotherapy  treatment,  or  lost  to  follow-up  before  the  end  of  treatment  [chemotherapy  plus 
radiotherapy]).  If  none  of  these  events  occurred  before  the  cut-off  date  or  occurred  after  the  cut-off 
date,  the  patient  was  censored  at  the  date  of  last  valid  assessment  before  cut-off  date;  at  the  cut-off 
date  otherwise.  Patients  lost  to  follow-up  after  the  end  of  the  treatment  (as  defined  above)  were 
censored at the date of last contact if it occurred before the cut-off date; at the cut-off date otherwise. 
Patients not treated were censored at their randomization date.

Quality of life evaluation:  
Two EORTC quality of life instruments were used in this study. The global quality of life domain of 
the  QLQ-C30  questionnaire  and  pain,  swallowing,  speech,  and  coughing  from  the  QLQ-H&N35 
module  were  used.  Evaluations  were  made  before  randomisation,  after  two  cycles,  at  the  end  of 
chemotherapy before starting radiotherapy, at six and nine months post end of radiotherapy. 
Clinical benefit: 
The performance status scale for head and neck (PSS-HN) developed and validated by M. List was 
used  to  evaluate  the  disabilities  of  subjects.  It  measures  disturbances  of  speech  and  eating. 
Assessments were those used for quality of life evaluation.  
Pain - (past 24 hours) was measured using a 100 mm scale. Assessments were those used for quality 
of life evaluation.  
WHO performance status score - was recorded at baseline, on day 1 of each cycle before treatment, at 
the end of chemotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy and in every follow-up after end-of-therapy. 
Sample size 
The  primary  endpoint,  PFS,  was  analysed  in  the  Intent-to-treat  population.  To  demonstrate  that  the 
experimental treatment increased the median PFS by 50%, i.e. 10 versus 15 months in the PF and TPF 
treatment groups, respectively, with a 2-sided 5% significance level and a 85% power, and a 5% lost 
to follow-up rate, 348 patients were to be recruited (174 in each treatment group) in order to observe 
260 events. It was anticipated that the accrual time would last 24 months followed by a further follow-
up of 12 months. 
A  2-stage  design  was  initially  planned  to  minimize  the  number  of  patients  treated  with  the  test 
regimen  under  the  null  hypothesis  (H0),  as  the  test  regimen  was  anticipated  to  be  more  toxic.  The 
stage  1  analysis  was  planned  to  be  performed  half-way  through  the  total  accrual  period  when  42 
events would have been observed. Due to trial execution issued the interim analysis (i.e., stage 1) was 
cancelled. Only the final analysis (stage 2) was performed. 
Statistical methods 
Four study populations were defined: an intent-to-treat (ITT) population, a safety population (SP), a 
radiotherapy safety population (RSP), and an evaluable for response population. 
Tests used 
A 2-sided 5% significance level was applied to all tests. 
Time-to-event  data  were  described  using  Kaplan-Meier  curves  and  compared  with  the  log-rank  and 
Wilcoxon linear rank tests and in Cox’s proportional hazards model.  
For multivariate analyses, five baseline variables were fitted to the model for each analysis: treatment, 
tumour site (oral cavity primary, oropharynx primary, hypopharynx primary versus larynx primary), T 
stage, N stage, and WHO performance status (WHO-PS). 
Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare groups on categorical variables. 
Logistic or proportional odds models were used to adjust for prognostic factors. 
A mixed model including the baseline score, treatment group, time, and treatment by time interactions 
effects were used to analyse quality of life data. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis at the end of the study was a comparison of PFS in the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population using a Cox’s proportional hazard model. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves and life 
tables were calculated in the ITT population.

Secondary efficacy analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses were carried on OS, ORR, TTF. 
Several sensitivity analyses were planned on the primary and secondary endpoints.  
Interim analysis 
Although planned no interim analysis was performed due to delays in data collection, data monitoring 
and validation. By the time the interim analysis was feasible, 90% of the planned patients were already 
recruited and safety data on the tested TPF treatment was available from phase II study and ongoing 
phase III studies. 
Follow up 
All patients were to be followed in the study until documentation of death. 
Efficacy results 
There were 358 patients randomized over 35 months.  Thirty-seven centers in 15 countries randomized 
patients in this study. As defined in the SAP, the cut-off date was chosen to include at least 260 PFS 
events. The occurrence of the 260th event was reported to the EORTC data center on 21 September 
2003, which corresponds to an overall median follow-up of 33.7 months.

Overall Survival 
At  the  cut  off  date,  237  of  358  (66.2%)  patients  had  died  (61.0%  and  71.3%  in  the  TPF  and  PF 
treatment  groups,  respectively).  The  proportion  of  patients  lost  to  follow-up  was  similar  in  the  2 
treatment groups (3.9% overall).

the  PF  treatment  group  (14.5  months,  95%  CI:  11.6-18.7).  The  difference  between  the  treatment 
groups was statistically significant (HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.93; log-rank test, P = 0.0128). A 3-years

Analysis of efficacy by subgroup - gender, age, and race 
Subgroup analyses were  performed to assess the  effects of gender and age on  measures of efficacy; 
data on race were not recorded in this study. Females comprised 10.2% of the TPF treatment group 
and 10.5% of the PF treatment group, and patients aged 65 and above comprised 10.2% of the TPF 
treatment group and 9.9% of the PF treatment group  
Quality of life  
The  self-administered  EORTC  questionnaires  (QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-H&N35)  were  used  and 
completed at 5 different time points (at baseline, at the end of Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and then 6 months and 
9 months after end of study treatment). 
As  expected,  the  compliance  decreased  over  time.  At  the  end  of  chemotherapy  treatment,  the 
compliance  was  72.7%  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  versus  67.7%  in  the  PF  treatment  group.  Nine 
months after completion of study treatment, it decreased to 40.7% in the TPF treatment group versus 
47.8% in the PF treatment group.  
The global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) score was one among the primary endpoints of the 
QoL analysis. For the EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL, the treatment effect was significantly (P = 0.01) 
lower  in  favour  of  TPF.  The  deterioration  of  the  global  health  score  during  study  was  statistically 
lower for the TPF treatment group compared to the PF treatment group.  
Using the QLQ-H&N35 data, the mean score of the four endpoints increased over time in both 
treatment arms, corresponding to a worsening of patient condition. However, because of the low 
compliance (about 30% of patients were compliant), no conclusion can be drawn concerning the effect 
of treatment. 
Clinical Benefit  
At baseline, almost all patients completed the PSS-HN assessment. The percentages decreased with 
time to approximately 50 to 55% at the end of treatment and over. Both groups reported deterioration 
during follow up. The deterioration was statistically greater for patients in the PF arm. Using a mixed 
model approach, a statistically significant (P = 0.0064) difference for normalcy of diet score was 
observed between the two treatment arms favouring TPF; similar results were observed for 
understandability of speech (P < 0.0001) and for eating in public (P = 0.0002). 
Pain intensity increased significantly with time (P < 0.001). No treatment effect was noticed. 
WHO performance status score was evaluated in more than 90% of patients. The WHP PS score was 
not significantly different between the two treatment arms: HR = 0.963 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.41).  
Using Kaplan-Meier estimate, median time to first deterioration was higher in the TPF treatment 
group (13.7 months; 95% CI, 10.7 to 21.0) than in the PF treatment group (8.3 months; 95% CI, 7.3 to 
9.6). The difference between the two treatment arms was statistically significant (log-rank test, 
P = 0.0158) with a 30% deterioration of WHO PS risk reduction for TPF compared to PF (HR = 0.70; 
95% CI, 0.52 to 0.94). 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
Phase I/II – Tax017HN and Tax708 
The  phase  I/II  studies  Tax017HN  and  Tax708  were  part  of  the  previous  submission  in  2000.  No 
updated data are provided as part of this resubmission. Several criticisms were raised by the CHMP in 
2001, particularly with reference to the design and the conduct of the studies. Compared to TAX708, 
Tax017HN included a larger proportion of patients with hypopharynx as primary site of the tumour, 
which  was  associated  with  worse  prognosis  than  oropharynx.  The  tumour  burden  of  patients  was 
EMEA/455093/2006 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 17/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher  in  TAX017HN  compared  to  TAX708  (48%  of  patients  with  T4  tumours  in  TAX017HN 
compared to 21% in TAX708. 29% of patients had N3 disease in TAX017HN compared  to 14% of 
patients in TAX708. 
Results  from  the  study  TAX017HN  did  not  confirm  the  high  response  rates  observed  in  study 
TAX708. Furthermore, the treatment regimen used in study TAX017HN is different from that used in 
study  TAX708.  Otherwise,  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  of  SCCHN,  outcome  of  therapy  depends  not 
only  on  induction  chemotherapy  but  also  on  loco-regional  treatment  (radiotherapy  and/or  surgery) 
following induction chemotherapy. However, outcome after complete treatment in study TAX708 has 
not been provided. 
Thus,  differences  in  drug  schedules  and  patient  populations  may  explain  the  differences  in  results 
observed.  Consequently,  the  heterogeneous  results  rendered  the  analysis  particularly  difficult.  The 
data  could  only  be  considered  as  indicative  of  an  activity  of  TPF  in  this  medical  setting,  but  not 
sufficient to support an extension of indication of Taxotere. In 2001, the CHMP preferred to postpone 
the  final  assessment  until  the  results  of  the  randomised  Phase  III  trials  were  available  for  a  reliable 
evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio.  
For  this  second  submission,  study  TAX017HN  could  be  considered  as  the  basis  for  dose  schedule 
selection for study TAX323. 
Phase III Study – TAX323 
Treatment of advanced SCCHN is complex and involves not only chemotherapy but also radiotherapy 
and surgery. The role of induction chemotherapy, i.e., neoadjuvant therapy, in the treatment of locally 
advanced  SCCHN  remains  controversial  despite  evidence  that  integrating  chemotherapy  into  the 
treatment  plan  of  locally  advanced  disease  can  lead  to  organ  preservation  and  improved  survival  of 
patients with resectable and unresectable disease. 
The  results  of  a  meta-analysis  of  chemotherapy  of  SCCHN  by  Pignon  et  al.  2000,  showed  that 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy by cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (PF) prior to surgery improves the local control 
and  has  a  small  non-significant  impact  on  survival.  At  the  time  of  study  initiation,  reference 
chemotherapy  treatment  in  this  neoadjuvant  setting  of  SCCHN  was  cisplatin  100  mg/m2  plus  5-
fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 (Paccagnella A et al. 1994). Therefore the control arm is acceptable. 
At the time when the TAX323 study was designed, concomitant CT-RT was not an accepted standard 
option. However, neo-adjuvant CT was also not a validated option (and is still not). So, from a 
scientific point of view, the study design should have been TPF+ RT vs RT alone. One can assume 
that survival after PF+RT is not lower than after RT alone. However, the chosen study design with 
docetaxel as an add-on to neoadjuvant PF-chemotherapy allows an assessment of the impact of 
docetaxel in this multimodal approach.  The higher rate of early deaths in the PF arm in study 
TAX323 remains unexplained. 
Thus, the current standard treatment of locally advanced SCCHN would be chemotherapy 
concurrently administered with radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy).  
The MAH has made a commitment to submit the final clinical study report of the US study TAX324 
(induction therapy followed by chemoradiation in patients with inoperable or low surgical SCCHN 
investigation ) as soon as it is available for CHMP review.

the  Guideline  on 
According 
in  man 
(CHMP/EWP/205/95/Rev.  3)  acceptable  primary  endpoints  for  phase  III  therapeutic  confirmatory 
studies should be time related. Overall survival is considered the most appropriate endpoint. However, 
for  the  tumor  entity  SCCHN  the  combination  of  primary  endpoint  PFS  with  the  key  secondary 
endpoint overall survival is considered acceptable to assess the clinical benefit of TPF.

The study was conducted in collaboration with a recognised institution, EORTC, and an Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was established. 
The originally planned external review of responses was cancelled, as PFS was the primary endpoint 
of the study (Protocol Amendment 2). It is well recognised in this population that review of radiologic 
images  alone  is  not  sufficient  for  adequate  tumor  assessment  because  of  many  confounding  factors 
such  as  inflammation,  oedema,  and  large  necrotic  lymph  nodes.  The  response  assessment  of  locally 
advanced SCCHN is mostly clinical and in an open trial, a blinded assessment would be preferable.  
In  order  to  provide  unbiased  results,  the  independent  “blinded”  review  of  images  could  have  been 
changed into an Independent Clinical Review Committee (ICRC). 
In SCCHN, local disease is often associated with pain, mutilation, and functional/nutritional problems, 
which  severely  impair  the  quality  of  life  of  the  patient.  Therefore  the  assessment  of  QOL  and  local 
clinical  benefit  is  appropriate.  The  QOL  questionnaire  and  the  specific  H&N  PS  scale  used  were 
appropriate. 
Chemotherapy 
As discussed above, study TAX323 used Cisplatin (100 mg/m2) plus 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2) as 
control  arm.  At  the  time  of  study  initiation,  reference  chemotherapy  treatment  in  this  neoadjuvant 
setting  of  SCCHN  was  cisplatin  100 mg/m2  plus  5-fluorouracil  1000  mg/m2  (Paccagnella  A  et  al. 
1994). Therefore the control arm is acceptable. 
A majority of patients in both treatment groups completed chemotherapy as per protocol: 70.1% in the 
TPF  treatment  group  and  61.9%  in  the  PF  treatment  group.  Completion  of  chemotherapy  as  per 
protocol” includes patients who completed chemotherapy either after 2 cycles or after 4 cycles”. 
In  the  TPF  treatment  group,  137  patients  (78.7%)  received  4  cycles  of  chemotherapy  and  in  the  PF 
treatment group 119 (65.7%) patients received 4 cycles. 
Chemotherapy was discontinued in 52 (29.4%) of the patients in the TPF treatment group and in 68 
(37.6%)  patients  in  the  PF  treatment  group.  In  both  treatment  groups,  the  most  frequent  reasons  for 
discontinuation  from  study  medication  were  progressive  disease  (TPF:  24  patients,  13.6%;  PF:  20 
patients,  11.0%),  AEs  (TPF:  11  patients,  6.2%;  PF:  21  patients,  11.6%)  and  death  (TPF:  6  patients, 
3.4%; PF: 12 patients, 6.6%). 
The potential impact in the number of toxic deaths within 30 days of last chemotherapy (4 in the TPF 
arm, 10 in the PF arm) on PFS was explored in an exploratory analysis censoring for these events. 
Based on the corresponding hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval (i.e. 0.74 [0.58-0.95]) one 
can exclude an impact of higher toxic death rate in the control arm on PFS outcomes. 
The potential impact in the number of toxic deaths within 30 days of last chemotherapy (4 in the TPF 
arm,  11  in  the  PF  arm)  on  OS  was  explored  in  an  exploratory  analysis  censoring  for  these  events. 
Although  the  analysis  is  consistent  (HR=0.75,  95%  CI:  0.58-0.97)  with  the primary  overall  survival 
analysis  (HR=0.72,  95%  CI:  0.56-0.93)  a  lower  HR  was  reported  when  toxic  deaths  are  censored.  
Despite the fact that, the benefit of TPF compared to PF on the survival curves appeared early (within 
2 to 6 months) after the start of chemotherapy, one can exclude an impact of higher toxic death rate 
within 30 days of last chemotherapy in the control arm on OS outcomes. 
It  should  also  be  taken  into  account  that  in  study  TAX323,  the  duration  of  a  planned  complete 
treatment is 6 months: 12 weeks for chemotherapy followed 4 to 7 weeks later by radiotherapy for up 
to 7 weeks.   
Dose reductions were made in 7.5% of patients in the TPF arm and in 12.7% of patients in the PF arm. 
The most frequent reason for dose reduction in both treatment groups was drug related toxicities (TPF: 
4.6%; PF: 11.0%). Taxotere dose modifications were indicated when patients experienced neutropenia 
and/or its complications, cutaneous reactions (grade 3 or 4, but not nail changes), elevated bilirubin, or 
impaired liver function.

The median relative dose intensity was greater than 0.90 in both study arms. 
Upon request, the Applicant performed an analysis on the patient group that completed chemotherapy 
as intended. Both subgroup OS and PFS analyses are consistent with primary analyses favouring the 
TPF arm. The benefit of TPF seems not to be linked to a suboptimal dosing of PF. 
Radiotherapy  
Radiotherapy  was  planned  for  all  patients  who  were  not  in  progression  at  their  last  cycle  of 
chemotherapy.  The  majority  of  patients  who  started  chemotherapy  received  radiotherapy  as  per 
protocol  in  both  treatment  groups:  74.7%  of  TPF  treated  patients  (130  patients),  and  68.5%  of  PF-
treated  patients  (124  patients).  However,  47  patients  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  (26.6%),  and  57 
patients in the PF treatment group (31.5%) did not receive radiotherapy as per protocol, but standard 
care according to institution prcatice. Unfortunately, the CRF did not document reasons why protocol 
radiotherapy was not delivered. 
Most patients in both treatment groups received conventional radiotherapy (TPF: 77.7%; PF: 77.2%). 
The median total dose of radiotherapy delivered was 70 Gy in 7 weeks in median in both treatment 
groups. 
Surgery  
Surgery was performed at the discretion of the local multidisciplinary team. 
More patients in the TPF arm had surgery during the study: 45 patients (25.9%) in the TPF treatment 
group and 27 patients (14.9%) in the PF. For 17 patients in the TPF treatment group and 9 patients in 
the PF treatment group, surgery was performed before PD occured.  
An  exploratory  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate  whether  surgery  performed  before  progression 
influenced  PFS.  The  hazard  ratio  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  were  0.76  [0.60-0.97]  (with 
censoring on first surgery before progression). The benefit remained in favour of the tested arm. 
Baseline data 
Demographic  and  tumor  characteristics  at  baseline  were  well  balanced:  most  patients  were  men 
(89.7%;. the median age was 53 years, with a range of 30 to 70 years. All patients except 1 in the TPF 
treatment group had WHO performance status of 0 or 1. 
The most frequent tumor site was the oropharynx (46.1% of patients). The most frequent clinical TNM 
stage  in  both  treatment  groups  was  T4  /  N2.  In  83%  of  patients,  2  organs  were  involved,  the  most 
common being lymph nodes and hypopharynx. 
The  population  of  patients  with  SCCHN  is  heterogeneous  and  exclusion  of  patients  with  particular 
history of disease (such as nasopharynx, nasal and paranasal cavities) is adequate. Co-morbidities are 
often  associated  with  SCCHN  and  patients  often  present  a  low  performance  status.  In  this  study, 
patients  should  have  had  a  good  performance  status  (WHO  PS  0  or  1).  Otherwise  the  results  of  the 
primary efficacy analysis on PFS, Cox model adjusted for the potential effect of the prognostic factors 
confirmed the prognostic value of PS (p=0.032).  
Prophylactic treatment 
According  to  the  protocol  a  majority  of  patients  in  each  arm  received  prophylactic  treatment  with 
antiemetics  and  corticosteroids.  Secondary  Prophylactic  G-CSF  was  used  in  a  minority  of  patients 
(less than 10% in each arm). 
The less frequent prophylactic antibiotic treatment administered in the control arm (6.6% vs 94.3% in 
TPF)  might  have  had  an  impact  on  patient  outcome.  Indeed,  as  discussed  above,  more  toxic  deaths 
(within 30 days of last chemotherapy) were reported in the PF arm (10 patients) versus in the TPF arm 
(4 patients). Higher doses of PF in the control than in the tested arm (PF100/100 vs TPF 75/75/750), a 
two  times  higher  rate  of  Grade  4  neutropenia  in  the  TPF  arm  (49%  vs  24%)  could  have  biased  the 
survival analysis. Although, exploratory analyses on PFS and survival did not evidence any impact on 
results when toxic deaths within 30 days of last chemotherapy were censored.

Further treatment 
Chemotherapy  was  the  most  common  further  anti-cancer  therapy  during  follow-up:  25  patients 
(19.2%)  in  TPF  arm  versus  29  patients  (23.4%)  in  PF  arm.    The  type  of  chemotherapy  was  not 
specified in the study report. 
Results 
The primary efficacy analysis reached statistical significance in favour of TPF with a 30% progression 
risk reduction compared to treatment with PF, when adjusting for the prognostic factors (WHO PS, 
primary tumor site: HR=  0.70 (95% CI: 0.55-0.89;P = 0.0042). Although the PFS assumptions 
considered during sample size calculation were not reached, statistical significance has been reached 
in favour of TPF: Median PFS was higher in the TPF treatment group (11.4 months, 95% CI: 10.1-
14.0) than in the PF treatment group (8.3 months, 95% CI: 7.4-9.1), (HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.92; log-
rank test, P = 0.0073).  
As  requested  unadjusted  analyses  for  PFS  and  OS  only  including  the  stratification  factors  tumour 
localisation  and  center  (addressed  as  geographical  region)  in  the  Cox  model  were  presented.  The 
results  are  consistent  with  the  overall  primary  analyses  results  presented.  Additional  sensitivity 
analyses  including  tumour  localisation  and  center  size  in  the  model  were  performed.  The  treatment 
effect is similar in small and large centers and is in accordance with the overall primary PFS and OS 
analyses. 
About 80% of patients reported a locoregional relapse and about 9% reported a distant relapse. The 
analyses of PFS by type of relapse report a Hazard Ratio similar to the overall PFS analysis i.e. still in 
favor  of  TPF  arm  (HR  for  Overall  PFS:  0.72;  HR  for  locoregional  PFS:  0.74;  HR  for  distant  PFS: 
0.73). 
The  absolute  numbers  of  relapses  are  lower  for  TPF  in  all  subgroups  (locoregional,  distant  and 
undefined relapse).  A higher proportion of relapses (recurrent/local or metastasis) was reported in the 
TPF tested arm. This could be explained by the higher rate of “undefined” relapses in the PF control 
arm (10.3% vs 5%). 
Secondary analyses supported the conclusions of the primary ones:  
- median overall survival (TPF: 18.6 months; PF: 14.5 months) showed a 28% risk reduction of death 
as compared to the PF treatment group and a 3-years survival rate estimate of 37.9% for TPF (versus 
26.3 for PF).  
- Best overall response to study treatment (chemotherapy + radiotherapy) (TPF: 72.3%; PF: 58.6%),  
- duration of response (TPF: 15.7 months; PF: 11.7 months), and  
- time to treatment failure (TPF: 10.3 months; PF: 7.3 months) were all in favour of TPF as compared 
to PF.  
All of these differences were statistically significant. Although the claimed indication is based on a 
single pivotal open trial, the difference in OS survival at three years is about 10% absolute and this is 
considered clinically relevant.  
The CHMP consider that clinical efficacy of docetaxel associated with treatment with cisplatin /5-FU 
has been demonstrated with reference to PFS, OS, and ORR. Overall efficacy data are considered 
sufficiently robust to support regulatory approval of TPF in the induction treatment of inoperable 
SCCHN.  
The results of QOL and clinical benefit were consistently in favour of TPF supporting the benefit of 
TPF excepted, pain intensity, which was comparable between both arms. 
In conclusion, statistically significant efficacy results as measured by the primary endpoint (PFS) and 
the secondary endpoint (OS) are associated with improved QoL and longer preservation of PS.

Clinical Safety  
Docetaxel  plus  cisplatin  and  5-FU  (TPF)  was  administered  to  patients  with  SCCHN  in  3  sponsored 
clinical trials: Two phase I-II studies, TAX 708 and TAX 017, and the pivotal phase III study, TAX 
323. A total of 449 patients were enrolled in these studies, and of these, 446 were evaluable for safety. 
The studies are described below in Table-6.

neutropenic infection in study TAX017HN were 5% and 4%, respectively. 
A majority of deaths were due to infectious complications despite co-medications administered.

Pivotal study – TAX323 
Patient exposure 
The total safety population (SP) includes 355 patients: 174 in the TPF treatment group, and 181 in the 
PF  treatment  group.  The  safety  population  for  the  radiotherapy  period  (RSP)  includes  only  patients 
who received locoregional radiotherapy in absence of disease progression. 
The total radiotherapy safety population includes 254 patients: 130 in the TPF treatment group, and 
124 in the PF treatment group. 
Chemotherapy: 
As measured by relative dose intensity, median number of cycles administered, and mean duration of 
treatment, extent of exposure to chemotherapy was similar in the 2 treatment groups.

All Treatment-emergent Adverse events (TEAE) 
Overview of TEAEs during chemotherapy: 
96.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy experienced at least 1 TEAE. The percentages of patients 
who experienced at least 1 possible/probable related TEAE or 1 TEAE regardless of relationship, were 
higher in the TPF treatment group than in the PF treatment group [(TPF: 96.6%; PF: 87.8%) and (TPF: 
99.4%; PF: 93.9%), respectively]. 
Grade  4  events  were  reported  in  9.2%  of  patients  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  and  11.6%  in  the  PF

TEAEs by NCIC CTG Category and Term 
During chemotherapy treatment: 
Reported TEAEs were similar in the 2 treatment groups for most NCIC CTG categories. Only the skin 
category  presented  a  >10%  difference  in  any  grade  TEAE  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (TPF: 
84.5%; PF: 55.2%).  
Skin  and  gastrointestinal  organ  systems  presented  grade  3/4  TEAEs  with  a  frequency  of  >10% 
between treatment groups [(TPF: 12.1%; PF: 1.7%) and (TPF: 10.9%; PF: 23.2%) respectively]. 
The neurologic organ system had grade 3/4 TEAEs with a frequency of >3% between the treatment 
groups (TPF: 2.9%; PF: 6.6%).

During chemotherapy:  
The 2 treatment groups were similar for most NCIC CTG categories related to treatment. 
Skin  and  gastrointestinal  categories  had  Grade  3-4  TEAEs  with  a  frequency  of  >10%  in  either 
treatment group [(TPF: 12.1%; PF: 1.1%) and (TPF: 8.6%; PF: 20.4%) respectively]. 
Neurologic category had grade 3/4 TEAEs with >3% difference between the 2 treatment 
(TPF: 0.6%; PF: 4.4%).  
The ocular disorders that developed in the TPF treatment group were consistent with the known safety 
profile  of  Taxotere  (1.7%  tearing  disorders/  1.1%  conjunctivitis).  The  grade  3/4  hepatic  disorder 
appears to be a liver failure in a patient with pre-existing liver cirrhosis (patient 00256). 
The  2  treatment  groups  were  similar  for  most  NCIC  CTG  terms  related  to  treatment.  The  5  most

stomatitis (TPF: 42.0%; PF: 45.9%), lethargy (TPF: 37.9%; PF: 29.8%) and vomiting (TPF: 25.9%; 
PF: 35.9%).  
Grade  3/4  related  TEAE  with  >3%  difference  in  incidence  between  the  2  treatment  groups  were  as 
follows : stomatitis (TPF: 4.0%; PF: 11.0%), nausea (TPF: 0.6%; PF: 6.6%) and vomiting (TPF: 0.6%; 
PF: 4.4%) and alopecia (TPF: 10.9%; PF: 0%) which was more frequent in the TPF treatment group. 
The  following  related  TEAEs  occurring  in  <5%  of  patients  were  considered  to  be  clinically 
meaningful  considering  the  known  safety  profiles  of  docetaxel,  cisplatin,  or  5-FU  :  dysrhythmias 
(TPF: 0.6%; PF: 1.1%), myocardial ischemia (TPF: 1.7%; PF: 0.6%), gastrointestinal bleeding (TPF: 
1.1%),  tearing  (TPF:  1.7%),  and  conjunctivitis  (TPF:  1.1%;  PF:  0.6%).  Of  these,  grade  3-4  related 
TEAEs  were  seen  for  dysrhythmias  (TPF:  0.6%),  myocardial  ischemia  (TPF:  1.7%),  and 
gastrointestinal bleeding (TPF: 0.6%). 
During radiotherapy:  
The  2  treatment  groups  were  similar  for  most  NCIC  CTG  categories  of  events  related  to  treatment 
during  radiotherapy.  No  category  had  a  >10%  difference  in  incidence  of  any  grade  related  TEAE 
between the 2 treatment groups.  
Gastrointestinal and skin categories had a >10% frequency of grade 3/4 related TEAE [(TPF: 38.5%; 
PF: 37.1%) and (TPF: 15.4%; PF: 16.1%)].  
No category had a difference >3% in grade 3/4 related TEAEs between the 2 treatment groups.  
The incidence of infection, any grade, was higher in the patients previously treated in the PF treatment 
group (TPF: 5.4%; PF: 13.7%). 
The 2 treatment groups were similar for most NCIC CTG terms related to radiotherapy. 
The 5 most frequent TEAEs were stomatitis (TPF: 76.9%; PF: 75.8%), 
esophagitis/dysphagia/odynophagia (TPF: 51.5%; PF: 54.0%), rash/itch (TPF: 33.8%; PF: 33.9%),

weight loss (TPF: 20.8%; PF: 21.8%), and other: skin disorder (TPF: 17.7%; PF: 20.2%). Grade 3/4 
stomatitis occurred in >10% of patients within both treatment groups (TPF: 33.1%; PF: 28.2%) as for 
esophagitis/dysphagia/odynophagia (TPF: 19.2%; PF: 21.8%).  
Radiotherapy-related infections had approximately an 8% higher incidence in the PF treated patients 
that received radiotherapy (PF: 13.7%; TPF: 5.4%). 
TEAEs during treatment 
The  following  related  TEAEs  occurring  in  <5%  of  patients  were  considered  to  be  clinically 
meaningful considering the known safety profiles of Taxotere, cisplatin, or 5-FU: dysrhythmias (TPF: 
0.6%; PF: 1.7%), myocardial ischemia (TPF: 1.7%; PF: 0.6%); gastrointestinal bleeding (TPF: 1.1%; 
PF: 0.0%); tearing (TPF: 1.7%; PF: 0.0%); and conjunctivitis (TPF: 1.1%; PF: 0.6%).  
Of these, grade 3-4 TEAEs (related) were seen for dysrhythmias (TPF: 0.6%, PF: 0.6%); myocardial 
ischemia (TPF: 1.7%; PF: 0.0%); and gastrointestinal bleeding (TPF: 0.6%; PF: 0.0%). 
Adverse  events  during  the  follow-up  (reported  as  late  radiation  toxicities  90  days  after  the  end  of 
study) 
Patients were reevaluated 12 weeks after the completion of the radiotherapy treatment period to 
assess  the  radiotherapy  late  effects.  The  frequency  by  patient  of  RTOG  AEs  was  73.8%  in  the  TPF 
treatment group and 65.3% in the PF treatment group, with most of the difference due to the RTOG 
criterion salivary glands (TPF: 63.1%; PF: 50.0%) and mucus membranes (TPF: 43.1%; PF: 31.5%), 
reflecting the RT field. Frequencies of RTOG AEs were generally similar for the 2 treatment groups. 
Serious adverse events  
Serious TEAEs during chemotherapy:  
27.6% patients in the TPF treatment group and 34.8% in the PF treatment group, experienced at least 1 
serious TEAE. 
Among  patients  with  serious  TEAE,  21.8%  in  the  TPF  arm  and  27.6%  in  the  PF  arm  experienced 
TEAE related to study treatment.

Serious TEAEs during radiotherapy: 
A total of 37 patients (14.6%) who received radiotherapy per protocol experienced at least 
1 serious TEAE regardless of relationship to radiotherapy.  
As  expected  for  head  and  neck  cancer  radiotherapy,  SAEs  were  mainly  due  to  mucosal  disorders.

Deaths on study 
A total of 253 (71.3%) treated patients  died during the study: 115 (66.1%) in the TPF arm  and 138 
(76.2%) in the PF arm. There were 8 deaths (8/174 = 4.6%) in the TPF treatment group and 22 deaths 
(22/181 = 12.2%) in the PF treatment group within 30 days of last administration of study treatment. 
In  both  treatment  groups,  one-half  of  the  deaths  occurring  within  30  days  of  last  study  medication 
were  due  to  toxicity,  and,  in  both  treatment  groups,  most  toxic  deaths  on  chemotherapy  occurred 
within the first 2 cycles. The majority of deaths occurring more than 30 days after last study treatment 
were due to progression of disease.

bDeath within 60 days from first administration of study treatment is also included in any of the other "dead" category 
(within 30 or more than 30 days from last administration of study treatment)  
Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment: 
The  cases  of  death  from  non-malignant  cause  were  more  frequent  in  the  PF  treatment  group  (19 
patients,  10.5%)  than  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  (7  patients,  4.0%).  Toxic  deaths  occurred  in  4 
patients (2.3%) in the TPF treatment group and 11 patients (6.1%) in the PF treatment group.  
Infection was the most common AE leading to death within 30 days of the last study treatment, with 3 
patients  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  and  11  patients  in  the  PF  treatment  group.  In  most  cases,  the 
infection was considered by the investigator to be related to treatment. 
Deaths more than 30 days after last study treatment:  
223  patients  (62.8%)  died  at  least  30  days  after  the  last  study  treatment:  107  in  the  TPF  treatment 
group (61.5%) and 116 in the PF treatment group (64.1%). 
The  major  cause  of  late  death  was  disease  progression.  The  other  causes  of  deaths  that  involved  32 
patients (TPF: 19 patients; PF: 13 patients) were distributed as follows: infection not due to protocol 
treatment  (TPF:  3  patients;  PF:  4  patients),  other  associated  chronic  disease  (TPF:  1  patient;  PF:  1 
patient), pulmonary embolism (PF: 1 patient), intercurrent death not due to malignant disease (TPF: 5 
patients; PF: 1 patient), other (TPF: 10 patients; PF: 5 patients), and 1 patient in PF for whom cause of 
death was missing. There were no deaths more than 30 days after the last study treatment that were 
related to study treatment.

Withdrawal due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of chemotherapy due to AEs occurred in 6.2% of TPF-treated patients and 11.6% of 
PF-treated patients. The most frequent AE that caused study discontinuation was altered hearing, with 
all instances in the PF treatment group (2.8%). 
Laboratory safety data 
Hematological evaluation 
-  Anemia  of  any  grade  occurred  frequently  (88%  of  patients  overall),  and  the  incidence  was 
comparable for both treatment groups. Grade 3-4 anemia occurred in 9.2% of patients in the 
TPF group and 13.8% in the PF group. 
- Leukopenia of any grade occurred in 91.4% of patients in the TPF group and 76.2% of patients in the 
PF  group  regardless  of  the  use  of  G-CSF.  Grade  3/4  leukopenia was  also  more  frequent  in  the  TPF 
group (41.4%) than in the PF group (23.2%). 
- Neutropenia occurred was more frequent among patients in the TPF group (93.1%) than in the PF 
group (86.7%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was also more frequent in the TPF group (76.3%) than in the 
PF group (52.8%), regardless the use of G-CSF. 
Prophylactic  G-CSF  was  given  to  a  total  of  31  evaluable  patients  (8.7%),  limiting  assessment  of 
benefit. The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia was similar with or without G-CSF. 
- Thrombocytopenia was higher in the PF treatment (47.0%) than in the TPF group (23.6%). Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia was also more frequent in the PF group (18.2%) than in the TPF group (5.2%). 
Reported  haematological  toxicity  is  not  unexpected  due  to  the  haematological  safety  profile  of 
docetaxel, cisplatin and 5FU. The tabulation below summarizes the different haematological results in 
both treatment groups.

Regarding  Hypocalcemia,  the  number  of  patients  who  presented  a  hypocalcemia  any  grade  was 
comparable  in  both  groups  (19.8%  vs  18.8%).  Nevertheless,  Grade  3-4  and  Grade  4  Hypocalcemia 
were higher in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm: 8 patients (4.8%) vs 4 (2.3%) for Grade 3-4 and 
6 patients (3.6%) vs 2 (1.1%) for Grade 4. 
Specific Safety Issues 
Neutropenic infection and febrile neutropenia 
Primary prophylaxis with antibiotics was required only in the TPF treatment group. 164 patients from 
the TPF group (94.3%) and 12 patients from the PF group  (6.6%) received primary prophylaxis with 
antibiotics. 
Secondary  infection  prophylaxis  was  required  for  both  treatment  groups  in  the  event  of  a  previous 
febrile neutropenia/infection episode or prolonged neutropenia grade 4 (≥7 days) or in case of delayed 
neutropenia recovery (≥28 days).  
The use of G-CSF in treatment of severe neutropenia was low and similar in both treatment groups.  
In correlation with the increase incidence of neutropenia grade 4 in the TPF treatment group, there was 
a higher number of patients with febrile neutropenia (TPF: 5.2%; PF: 2.2%) or neutropenic infection 
(TPF: 13.9%; PF: 8.3%).  
Four  patients  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  and  6  patients  in  the  PF  treatment  group  died  due  to 
neutropenic  infection.  All  6  deaths  due  to  infection  or  subsequent  multi-organ  failure  in  the  PF 
treatment  group  occurred  within  30  days  of  chemotherapy  and  were  considered  related  to  the 
chemotherapy.  The  same  was  true  of  only  2  of  the  4  neutropenic  infections  in  the  TPF  treatment 
group:  Patients  00202  and  00236  died of  infection not due  to  protocol  treatment  more  than  30 days 
after the last study treatment. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety  
The safety profile of the TPF regimen is in accordance with what was expected, and is acceptable.  
The global toxicity in the TPF arm appears to be better tolerated as compared to the PF arm.  
Skin toxicity, whatever the Grade of events, was higher in the TPF arm compared to PF arm. On the 
other hand, gastrointestinal toxicity was higher in the PF arm as compared to the TPF arm.  
Hypersensitivity and ocular reactions, which represent well-known toxicities of docetaxel, are mostly 
reported in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm [(6.3% vs 2.8%) and (4.6% vs 1.7%)]. 
There  were  more  reports  of  alopecia,  lethargy,  diarrhea,  taste  and  sense  of  smell  altered  in  the  TPF 
arm and more stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting in the PF arm. 
Frequencies of serious adverse events during chemotherapy are comparable between the two treatment 
groups. 
Although  frequencies  of  fever  in  absence  of  infection  (TPF:  5.7%,  PF:  2.8%),  febrileneutropenia 
(TPF: 5.2%, PF: 2.2%) and Grade 3-4 neutropenia (TPF: 76.3%, PF: 52.8%) were higher in the TPF 
arm compared to the PF arm, the frequency of death due to infection was higher in the PF arm. The 
positive role of prophylaxis antibiotherapy in the TPF arm cannot be ruled out. 
The frequency of death within 30 days of last study treatment was higher in the PF arm as compared to 
the TPF arm (12% vs 4.6%), with a higher number of toxic deaths in the PF arm as compared to the 
TPF arm (11(6.1%) vs 4 (2.3%)). With reference to toxic death: 2/4 cases in the TPF arm and 9/11 in 
the PF arm were due to infection and/or sepsis. Most of the cases of infection leading to death 
appeared during cycle 1 of chemotherapy treatment (2/2 in TPF arm; 4/9 in PF arm). 
The  overall  incidence  of  severe  infections  that  were  not  a  complication  of  a  neutropenia  were  not 
different  in  the  PF  arm  as  compared  to  the  TPF  arm  (7.7%  and  8.6%,  respectively).  Therefore,  the 
higher rate of toxic deaths within 30 days of last chemotherapy in the PF control arm than in the TPF 
tested arm could not be clearly explained.

No scientific rationale supports the use and the benefit of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in the TPF 
arm. Indeed at the initiation of study TAX323, based on limited data from the non-controlled phase II 
study,  TAX  017,  including  TPF  regimen  in  subjects  with  SCCHN,  it  was  deemed  appropriate  to 
include  mandatory,  broad-spectrum,  oral  antibiotic  prophylaxis  (ie,  ciprofloxacin)  for  all  subjects 
randomised to receive TPF. As discussed above, in study TAX323, the incidence of clinical significant 
infectious  episodes  is  similar  between  TPF  and  PF  and  even  higher  in  TPF  arm.  Treatment-related 
neutropenic infection and febrile neutropenia were reported more frequently in the TPF treatment arm 
compared  to  PF:  11.0%  and  5.2%  compared  to  5.6%  and  2.2%  per  patient,  respectively.  As  the 
compliance  with  antibiotic  prophylaxis  was  high,  there  are  no  results  for  TPF  regimen  without 
ciprofloxacin from this study. As most oncology organizations do currently not recommend antibiotic 
prophylaxis  in  this  setting,  the  CHMP  would  not  recommend  compulsory  prophylactic  antibiotic 
therapy for TPF.  
Relatively  higher  proportions  of  elderly  patients  experienced  febrile  neutropenia  or  neutropenic 
infections. Because of the small number of patients aged 65 and above, no conclusion could be drawn 
from this study. 
Regarding deaths more than 30 days after last study treatment: death was reported as other cause than 
disease progression for 19 patients in TPF arm and 13 in PF arm. Among the 19 cases of death in the 
TPF  arm,  15  were  reported  as  “Other”  or  “Intercurrent  death  not  due  to  malignant  disease”.  The 
CHMP  agrees  that  among  these  15  death  cases,  no  cases  evocated  suspected  toxic  death  related  to 
chemotherapy. 
Altered hearing led to discontinuation in (5/181) patients in the PF arm. This represents the most 
frequent adverse event leading to discontinuation in the PF arm.  
Regarding the TPF arm, 11 patients presented adverse events leading to discontinuation. Among them, 
3 cases concerned myocardial ischemia ischemia (1.7%) are reported as serious related adverse events 
in the TPF arm. In two cases, the patients did not present any cardiovascular history. In the remaining 
case, the patient presented a history of hypertension, COPD, and hypercholesterolemia. All the cases 
were considered as probably related to regimen by the investigator.  
The ADR “myocardial ischemia” has been added in section 4.8 of the SPC of docetaxel under 
Taxotere in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU. The CHMP agree to only mention the risk of cardiac 
ischemia in section 4.8 at this point in time. However, the risk should be monitored as part of future 
PSURs. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
Patients  with  inoperable  locally  advanced  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  head  and  neck  (SCCHN) 
have  a  poor  prognosis.  Treatment  of  advanced  SCCHN  is  complex  and  involves  not  only 
chemotherapy  but  also  radiotherapy  and  surgery.  The  role  of  induction  chemotherapy  (i.e., 
neoadjuvant  therapy)  in  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  SCCHN  remains  controversial  despite 
evidence that integrating chemotherapy into the treatment plan of locally advanced disease can lead to 
organ preservation and improved survival of patients with resectable and unresectable disease. 
This is the second application for a type II variation to extend the indications of TAXOTERE in the 
“induction  treatment  of  patients  with  inoperable  locally  advanced  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the 
head  and  neck  in  combination  with  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil”,  is  supported  by  a  large,  well-
managed  and  well-analysed  pivotal  phase  III  trial,  XRP6976F-323/EORTC  2971  (EFC6042).  This 
study assessed the benefit of induction chemotherapy followed by conventional radiotherapy.  
Patients were randomized to receive either: 
- test group: docetaxel plus cisplatin plus 5-FU (TPF) followed by locoregional radiation therapy 
- control group: cisplatin plus 5-FU (PF ) followed by locoregional radiation therapy 
Randomization was stratified upon 2 factors: the primary tumor site (oral cavity versus oropharynx 
versus hypopharynx versus larynx) and the center (i.e. institution).

The comparator regimen is well recognised. At the time of study initiation, reference chemotherapy 
treatment in this neoadjuvant setting of SCCHN was cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil 1000 
mg/m2 (Paccagnella A et al. 1994). Therefore the control arm is acceptable. 
However, it remains unclear how TPF compares to the current standard treatment, chemoradiotherapy 
(CRT) regarding efficacy and safety.  
In the TPF arm only, patients had to receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy. 
No scientific rationale supports the use and the benefit of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in the TPF 
arm.  At  the  time  of  the  initiation  of  study  TAX323,  based  on  limited  data  from  the  non-controlled 
phase II study TAX 017, including TPF regimen in subjects with SCCHN, it was deemed appropriate 
to include mandatory, broad-spectrum, oral antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e., ciprofloxacin) for all subjects 
randomised  to  receive  TPF.  In  TAX017  lower  rates  of  treatment-related  infections  and  fever  in  the 
absence of infection were observed in the cohort that received prophylactic antibiotic therapy. 
In study TAX323, the incidence of clinical significant infectious episodes is similar between TPF and 
PF  and  even  higher  in  the  TPF  arm  (treatment-related  neutropenic  infection  and  febrile  neutropenia 
were reported more frequently in the TPF treatment arm compared to PF: 11.0% and 5.2% compared 
to 5.6% and 2.2% per patient respectively).  
Most  oncology  organizations  do  not  seem  to  recommend  antibiotic  prophylaxis  in  this  setting  at 
present. Accordingly, the CHMP does not recommend compulsory prophylactic antibiotic therapy for 
TPF.  
With  reference  to  demographic  and  tumor  characteristics  at  baseline,  the  two  treatment  groups  are 
comparable: most patients were men (89.7%), the median age was 53 years, with a range of 30 to 70 
years. All patients except 1 in the TPF treatment group had WHO performance status of 0 or 1. 
The most frequent tumor site was the oropharynx (46.1% of patients). The most frequent clinical TNM 
stage in both treatment groups was T4 / N2. 
The vast majority of patients received chemotherapy and radiotherapy as outlined in the protocol.  
Surgery was performed at the discretion of the local multidisciplinary team.  
More patients in the TPF arm had surgery during the study: 45 patients (25.9%) in the TPF treatment 
group and 27 patients (14.9%) in the PF.  
The median relative dose intensity is above 0.90 in both study arms. 
A majority of patients in both treatment groups completed chemotherapy as per protocol (as intended) 
l:  70.1%  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  and  61.9%  in  the  PF  treatment  group.  Completion  of 
chemotherapy as per protocol ”includes patients who completed chemotherapy either after 2 cycles or 
after 4 cycles”. 
In  the  TPF  treatment  group,  137  patients  (78.7%)  received  4  cycles  of  chemotherapy  and  in  the  PF 
treatment group 119 (65.7%) patients received 4 cycles. 
Chemotherapy  was  discontinued  in  52  (29.4%)  of  patients  in  the  TPF  treatment  group  and  in  68 
(37.6%)  patients  in  the  PF  treatment  group.  In  both  treatment  groups,  the  most  frequent  reasons  for 
discontinuation  from  study  medication  were  progressive  disease  (TPF:  24  patients,  13.6%;  PF:  20 
patients,  11.0%),  AEs  (TPF:  11  patients,  6.2%;  PF:  21  patients,  11.6%)  and  death  (TPF:  6  patients, 
3.4%; PF: 12 patients, 6.6%). 
As requested, the MAH performed an analysis on the patient group that completed chemotherapy as 
intended. Both subgroup OS and PFS analyses are consistent with the primary analyses favouring the 
TPF arm. The benefit of TPF seems not to be linked to a suboptimal dosing of PF. 
Clinical efficacy results of study TAX323 are convincing in terms of significantly decreased risk for 
progression  (primary  criterion  PFS)  and  survival  benefit  (secondary  criterion).  These  results  are 
clinically relevant and reached statistical significance:  
Primary  efficacy  analysis  was  a  comparison  of  PFS  adjusted  for  prognostic  factors  in  the  ITT 
population at the end of the study using a Cox proportional hazards model. 
Treatment with TPF was associated with a 30% progression risk reduction compared to treatment with 
PF, when adjusting for the prognostic factors (WHO PS, primary tumor site):  HR of 0.70 (95% CI: 
0.55-0.89;P = 0.0042). 
EMEA/455093/2006 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 35/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Median PFS was higher in the TPF treatment group (11.4 months, 95% CI: 10.1-14.0) than in the PF 
treatment  group  (8.3  months,  95%  CI:  7.4-9.1),  (HR  0.72,  95%  CI:  0.57-0.92;  log-rank  test,  P  = 
0.0073).  
About 80% of patients reported a locoregional relapse and about 9% reported a distant relapse. The 
analyses of PFS by type of relapse, report a Hazard Ratio similar to the overall PFS analysis i.e., still 
in favor of TPF arm. (HR for Overall PFS: 0.72; HR for locoregional PFS: 0.74; HR for distant PFS: 
0.73).  A  higher  proportion  of  relapses  (recurrent/local  or  metastasis)  was  reported  in  the  TPF  tested 
arm. This could be explained by the higher rate of “undefined” relapses in the PF control arm (10.3% 
vs 5%). 
The originally planned external review of responses was cancelled, as PFS was the primary endpoint 
of  the  study  (Protocol  Amendment  2).  It  is  well  recognised  in  this  population  that  the  review  of 
radiologic images alone is not sufficient for adequate tumor assessment because of many confounding 
factors  such  as  inflammation,  oedema,  and  large  necrotic  lymph  nodes.  The  response  assessment  of 
locally  advanced  SCCHN  is  mostly  clinical  and  in  an  open  trial,  a  blinded  assessment  would  have 
been  preferable.  In  order  to  provide  unbiased  results,  the  independent  “blinded”  review  of  images 
could have been changed into an Independent Clinical Review Committee (ICRC). 
The study was conducted in collaboration with a recognised institution, EORTC, and an Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was established.

According 
(CHMP/EWP/205/95/Rev.  3)  acceptable  primary  endpoints  for  phase  III  therapeutic  confirmatory 
studies should be time related. For the tumor entity SCCHN the combination of primary endpoint PFS 
with the key secondary endpoint overall survival is considered acceptable to assess the clinical benefit 
of TPF treatment. 
the  evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products 
Secondary analyses supported the conclusions of the primary analyses:  
- median time to death (TPF: 18.6 months; PF: 14.5 months) showed a 28% risk reduction of death as 
compared to PF treatment group and a 3-years survival rate estimate of 37.9% for TPF (versus 26.3 for 
PF);  
- best overall response to study treatment (chemotherapy + radiotherapy) (TPF: 72.3%; PF: 58.6%),  
- duration of response (TPF: 15.7 months; PF: 11.7 months), and  
- time to treatment failure (TPF: 10.3 months; PF: 7.3 months) were all in favour of TPF as compared 
to PF.  
All of these differences are statistically significant. 
Analyses for PFS and OS according to the stratification factors by Cox model, including tumour 
localisation and center, and tumour localisation and geographical region respectively, were performed. 
HR adjusted for the stratification factors are consistent with the overall primary analyses results 
presented. The treatment effect is similar between small and large centers and in accordance with the 
overall primary PFS and OS analyses. 
Thus, clinical efficacy of docetaxel associated with cisplatin/5-FU treatment has been demonstrated 
with reference to PFS, OS, and ORR. Overall efficacy data are considered sufficiently robust to 
support regulatory approval of TPF in the induction treatment of inoperable SCCHN.  
Two  QoL  questionnaires  and  3  instruments  for  the  measurement  of  clinical  benefit  were  used. 
Compliance with the instruments decreased over time, it was unacceptably low for the QLQ-H&N35 
questionnaire  partly  due  to  the  fact  that  questionnaire  translations  were  not  available  for  some 
countries.  For  quality  of  life  the  predefined  analysis  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  showed  a  significant 
benefit for TPF treatment. Results were similar for the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck 
and  an  exploratory  analysis  of  the  deterioration  of  the  WHO  performance  scale.  These  results  may 
reflect those of the efficacy endpoints. At least an independent deterioration of quality of life by the 
experimental treatment can be excluded.  
Pain intensity improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate pain management in both 
treatment groups.

From the point of view of safety, as expected for this type of combination chemotherapy, nearly all 
patients  in  both  treatment  arms  experienced  treatment  related  adverse  events.  The  incidences  for 
severe TEAEs (grade 3-4 and grade 4 respectively) and serious TEAEs were comparable between the 
treatment groups.  
Generally the pattern of the reported AEs is as expected for the used medicinal products. The TEAEs 
that  were  more  commonly  reported  with  TPF  compared  with  PF  attribute  mostly  to  the  addition  of 
docetaxel: neutropenia, neutropenic infection, lethargy, diarrhoea, fluid retention, neurosensory, sense 
of smell/taste altered. However, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss were 
observed more frequently with PF, which may reflect the higher dose intensity of cisplatin.  
No new type of TEAE was identified in the studies. The tolerance of radiotherapy was not impaired by 
the new combination.  
Fewer  patients  withdraw  from  the  trial  due  to  adverse  events  in  the  TPF  treatment  group.  It  is 
encouraging that the experimental treatment was associated with fewer deaths within 30 days of study 
treatment and fewer deaths due to infections. The routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the TPF group may 
account to this difference.  
The application also included two Phase I/II studies (TAX 017 and TAX 708) in SCCHN investigating 
two  different  doses  of  cisplatin  and  the  combination  docetaxel,  cisplatin,  and  5-fluorouracil.  These 
studies  had  a  similar  design  and  were  performed  in  the  target  population  of  patients  with  advanced 
previously untreated SCCHN in Europe and the US.  
These  studies  were  part  of  the  previous  submission  in  2000.  No  updated  data  are  provided  in  this 
second submission. 
Differences in drug schedules and patient populations may explain the differences observed in efficacy 
and safety results. Consequently, the heterogeneous results rendered the analysis particularly difficult. 
The data could only be considered as indicative of an activity of TPF in this medical setting, but not 
sufficient  to  support  an  extension  of  indication  of  Taxotere.  For  this  second  submission,  study 
TAX017HN could be considered as the basis for dose schedule selection for study TAX323. 
The  MAH  sponsors  another  US  phase  III  study  in  a  similar  indication,  TAX  324,  investigating 
induction chemotherapy (TPF vs PF) followed by concomitant radio-chemotherapy. From the point of 
view of current clinical practice, the design of study TAX324 is interesting.  
The  MAH  has  committed  to  submit  the  final  clinical  study  report  of  study  TAX324  as  soon  as  it 
becomes available.  
Reference  was  also  made  to  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction  study,  XRP6976E/1001,  submitted  and 
assessed within variation II67 for the gastric adenocarcinoma indication.  
The primary objective of this study was to determine in a randomized, cross-over setting (each patient 
being  his  own  control),  if  there  was  any  clinically  significant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between 
docetaxel  (Taxotere)  75  mg/m2,  cisplatin  75  mg/m2,  and  5-fluorouracil  (5-FU)  750  mg/m2/day  for  5 
days. Study, XRP6976E/1001 included 15 patients with solid tumors who received either TPF at cycle 
1 and TP at cycle 2, or TP at cycle 1 and TPF at cycle 2. 
Study XRP6976E/1001 led to include the following information in the section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic 
Properties) of the SPC “The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 
patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug.” 
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  Benefit  Risk  balance  of  docetaxel  in  combination  with 
cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil  as  induction  treatment  of  patients  with  inoperable  locally  advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, is clearly positive.

 CONCLUSION 
On 21 September 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

1.5.  Applicant’s request for consideration 
1.5.1.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance eptacog beta (activated) contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance in comparison to eptacog alfa (activated) 
previously authorised in the European Union as NovoSeven, as the applicant claimed that eptacog beta 
(activated) differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the already 
authorised active substance.  
However, based on the review of the available data the active substance eptacog beta (activated) 
contained in the medicinal product Cevenfacta is not to be qualified as a new active substance in 
comparison to the known eptacog alfa (activated) previously authorised in the European Union as 
NovoSeven as it is not demonstrated that it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and 
efficacy from the previously authorised substance.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder due to a deficiency of FVIII (haemophilia A) or 
FIX (haemophilia B) which results from mutations of the respective clotting factor genes leading to 
either reduced production or a defective form of coagulation factor. Virtually only males are affected 
with the congenital form of haemophilia as both the FVIII and FIX genes are located on the X 
chromosome. However, in rare cases females may also have symptoms of disease, usually due to the 
preferential inactivation of one of the X chromosomes. 
The most severe complication of treatment with exogenous factor concentrate is the development of 
antibodies to the factor concentrate, often of a neutralising form, which are referred to as inhibitors 
(Kempton, 2009). Treatment of these patients with factor concentrates will be less effective when high 
titres of inhibitors are present based on the established Bethesda assay to measure FVIII or FIX 
inhibitors (Bethesda Units [BU]) (Miller, 2018). 
The CHMP has agreed with the following indication: Cevenfacta is indicated in adults and adolescents 
(12 years of age and older) for the treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding 
in those undergoing surgery or invasive procedures in the following patient groups:  
• 
• 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with high-responding inhibitors to coagulation factors 
VIII or IX (i.e. ≥5 Bethesda Units (BU)); 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with low titre-response inhibitors (BU <5), but 
expected to have a high anamnestic response to factor VIII or factor IX administration or 
expected to be refractory to increased dosing of FVIII or FIX. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The prevalence of haemophilia A is approximately 1:7500 and of haemophilia B is 1:30000 males 
(Ljung, 2018). Depending on the concentration of FVIII or FIX, the disorders are classified as severe 
(<0.01 U/mL), moderate (0.01–0.05 U/mL), or mild (0.05–0.40 U/mL). The severe form is usually 
diagnosed during the first year of life due to abnormal subcutaneous hematoma after minimal trauma, 
or spontaneous hematomas. The typical joints affected are the ankles, knees, and elbows resulting in 
chronic arthropathy with significant deformities in the long term if untreated. In the pre-clotting factor 
concentrate era, death in both conditions was primarily due to intracranial haemorrhage or other life-
threatening bleeds and patients rarely survived beyond 10 years. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Clinical presentation: Haemophilia A and B are classified as ‘severe’, ‘moderate’ or ‘mild’ according to 
endogenous FVIII or IX plasma activity level and factor levels are generally correlated to the severity 
of bleeding: 
• 
Severe haemophilia: FVIII activity <1% - patients experience bleeding into joints or muscles 
often without any apparent reason (spontaneous bleeding). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 12/137 
 
 
 
• 
Moderate haemophilia: FVIII activity 1 to <5% - patients experience occasional spontaneous 
bleeding and prolonged bleeding with minor trauma or surgery. 
• 
Mild haemophilia: FVIII activity 5 to <40% - patients experience severe bleeding with major 
trauma or surgery and spontaneous bleeding is rare. 
The most common manifestation of haemophilia is bleeding into joints. Repeated bleeding into the 
same joint, referred to as a target joint, can prevent healing and thus cause chronic inflammation and 
musculoskeletal pain, reduced range of motion and diminished quality of life. 
Diagnosis: Haemophilia should be suspected in individuals presenting with a history of any of these 
symptoms: easy bruising; “spontaneous” bleeding (i.e., bleeding for no apparent/known reason), 
particularly into the joints, muscles, and soft tissues; excessive bleeding following trauma or surgery. 
Early symptoms of joint bleeds in children at a very young age are a key indicator of severe 
haemophilia. If haemophilia is suspected, the clinician should obtain the patient’s bleeding history and 
family history of abnormal or unexplained bleeding experienced by any siblings or maternal male 
relatives (i.e., maternal cousin, uncle, or grandfather) to assess patterns of inheritance and assist with 
diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of haemophilia is essential to inform appropriate management. A 
definitive haemophilia diagnosis is based on a factor assay to demonstrate deficiency of FVIII or FIX. 
The most challenging complication in the treatment of haemophilia is the development of anti-FVIII or 
FIX alloantibodies also called inhibitors, which affects approximately one-third of patients with severe 
haemophilia A and approximately 3-5% of those with severe haemophilia B. Such inhibitors, that 
neutralise the functional activity of FVIII and FIX administered for replacement therapy, impact 
patients’ access to a safe and effective care, and predispose them to an increased risk of morbidity and 
mortality (Franchini, 2018). Inhibitors may occur at any time in a patient’s life, but the majority of 
patients develop inhibitors early in life during the first 50 exposure days (EDs). People with a family 
history of inhibitors, patients with certain genetic mutations or certain blood types (Franchini, 2011), 
and non-whites are at a higher risk for developing inhibitors. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Treatment of haemophilia A and B patients is usually with anti-homophilic factor products, replacing 
the deficient factor (i.e. FVIII or FIX). Prophylactic administration to maintain circulating factor levels 
above 1 IU/dL (1%) of normal level has resulted in a substantial reduction in bleeding frequency and 
its associated complications, with significant improvements to life expectancy. Preventive treatment is 
given prior to surgical procedures or invasive investigations (i.e. endoscopy with biopsies, tooth 
extractions). 
For the proposed patient population who developed inhibitors, permanent eradication of inhibitors is 
usually first choice. ITI involves administration of factor VIII or IX in a small dose to begin with and 
gradually increasing the dose so that the individual’s immune system learns to tolerate the clotting 
factor and ceases to produce inhibitors. However, an optimal regimen for ITI remains to be defined and 
the length of treatment is based on individual responses, ranging from months to years and comes 
with high treatment burden.  
The current standard of care for treatment of bleeds or prevention of bleeding in those undergoing 
surgery in haemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors is treatment with bypassing agents (BPAs). The 
two products available for this are: 
• 
recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 13/137 
 
 
 
• 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, or factor eight inhibitors bypassing agent 
[FEIBA]). 
BPAs are short-acting and may need to be administered often, with long IV infusion times (25-50 
minutes for FEIBA) and/or require frequent administration for prophylaxis (daily or every other day for 
FEIBA). Frequent administration is time-consuming and burdensome for people with haemophilia A and 
their caregivers. NovoSeven is indicated for episodic use only, while FEIBA is approved for episodic and 
prophylactic use. 
For patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors, emicizumab (Hemlibra) is another option for 
prophylaxis of bleeding episodes. Emicizumab is a humanised bispecific monoclonal antibody that 
bridges activated FIX and FX to mimic the function of activated FVIII, thereby increasing thrombin 
formation. Such an option is not available for patients with haemophilia B with inhibitors.  
2.2.  About the product 
The drug product LR769 (drug substance eptacog beta (activated) or Cevenfacta is an activated 
recombinant human coagulation Factor VII (rhFVIIa) concentrate which belongs to the 
pharmacotherapeutic group of Blood Coagulation Factors. LR769 is a recombinant analogue of human 
FVIIa, a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor. In the presence of both calcium and phospholipids, 
FVIIa in a complex with tissue factor (TF) activates Factor X (FX) to Factor Xa (FXa), directly bypassing 
the reactions that require Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX). Activation of FX to FXa initiates the 
common pathway of the coagulation cascade in which prothrombin is activated to thrombin, which then 
converts fibrinogen to fibrin to form a haemostatic plug, thereby achieving clot formation at the site of 
haemorrhage (haemostasis). This process may also occur in the absence of Tissue Factor on the 
surface of activated platelets (Hoffman, 1998). 
LR769 is an activated recombinant human coagulation rhFVIIa produced by recombinant 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology employing site-directed expression of the human FVII gene in 
the mammary gland of transgenic rabbits. The transgene containing the FVII has been stably 
integrated into the transgenic rabbit genome. The recombinant human FVII gene is exclusively 
expressed by the mammary gland under the control of a beta-casein specific promoter. Milk from these 
transgenic rabbits is collected and the FVII protein expressed is subsequently purified and activated 
during the purification process to FVIIa. The glycoprotein produced (FVII) consists of 406 amino acid 
residues (molecular weight 50 KDa) which is structurally similar to human plasma derived coagulation 
FVIIa and has similar functional properties to human plasma-derived FVIIa and to another recombinant 
FVIIa (eptacog alfa). 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Cevenfacta finished product (LR769) (active substance: eptacog beta (activated), as per INN) is an 
activated recombinant human coagulation Factor VII (FVIIa) produced by recombinant 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology employing site-directed expression of the human FVII gene in 
the mammary gland of transgenic rabbits.  
The finished product is a sterile lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. It is supplied 
in vials (powder) with three dosage strengths (1 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg of eptacog beta (activated)) with a 
prefilled syringe (PFS) for the solvent (water for injections). The other excipients are: (powder)

arginine hydrochloride, isoleucine, trisodium citrate dihydrate, glycine, lysine hydrochloride, 
polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid and (solvent) water for injections. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The international nonproprietary name (INN) for the recombinant DNA derived blood-coagulation factor 
VII (activated), extracted from transgenic rabbits’ milk is eptacog beta (activated). 
Coagulation Factor VIIa (Recombinant) (rhFVIIa) is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein consisting of 
406 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 50 kilodaltons (kDa). During its purification, 
the recombinant DNA derived Factor VII protein is activated to the serine protease Factor VIIa. 
Activation occurs by cleavage of the single chain molecule on the C-terminal side of the Arg152 
residue, to produce an N-terminal derived light chain (LC) of 20 kDa (152 residues) and a C-terminal 
derived heavy chain (HC) of 30 kDa (254 residues), which remain covalently associated by a single 
disulfide bond. 
Recombinant human FVIIa possesses a modular organisation with an N-terminal membrane-binding γ-
carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing domain, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a 
C-terminal serine protease domain. Recombinant human FVIIa contains 12 disulfide bridges, seven of 
which are located on the light chain, four on the heavy chain, and one which enables the light and 
heavy chains to remain covalently bound once cleaved (interchain). The active protein is glycosylated 
with two N-linked glycosylation sites (one on its LC at Asn145 and one on its HC at Asn322) and two 
O-linked glycosylation sites (on its LC, at Ser52 and Ser60) and the molecule contains γ-carboxylated 
glutamic acid residues which are essential for functional activity. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The name(s), address(es), and responsibilities of each manufacturer (including contractors, and each 
production site or facility involved in the manufacture, testing and/or storage of rhFVIIa active 
substance (AS) have been provided. LFB Biomanufacturing (Le quartier du Rieu, Avenue des Chênes 
Rouges, 30100 Alès, France) is the manufacturing site responsible for the manufacture of the active 
substance.  
Different sites are involved in the rabbit semen bank production and storage. A valid proof of GMP 
compliance was provided. All the manufacturing sites are GMP compliant. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process has been presented in sufficient detail. The source material is rabbit milk 
that is collected at milking facilities. The milk from qualified rabbits is collected and frozen. The frozen 
milk source material is thawed and pooled to generate the milk starting material for clarification. The 
pooled milk starting material is clarified. The clarified milk starting material is then viral inactivated by 
solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment, purified using chromatography column, concentrated, buffer 
exchanged and filtered into a partially purified bulk intermediate (IP). The IP is stored frozen for 
further processing. The IP is thawed, pooled, nanofiltered and further purified through several 
orthogonal chromatography steps and filtered into formulated bulk active substance (BAS). The BAS is 
stored frozen. Further information on the rhFVII activation process, which is supported by data has 
been provided.

Control of materials: 
The controls which are set in order to assure that the animals, source material, and starting material 
(SM) are of the highest quality to continue on in processing to active substance and eventually to 
finished product were adequately described. 
The recombinant human coagulation Factor VII (rhFVII) protein is secreted as a non-activated form 
into the milk of qualified rabbits with the human Factor VII (hFVII) transgene stably integrated into 
their genome. Two lines of animals have been used to produce rhFVIIa. Initial work was done on the 
material collected from animals derived from the male founder. This material was used to develop the 
system, for early method development, and for optimpaediatric of milking systems and protein 
purification development. Subsequently the production line was selected, derived from female founder 
R69, which has simplified genetics of the transgene integration (a single copy of the hFVII gene) with 
improved production of milk. 
Since the same gene construct was used to generate both lines and many methods were developed 
using the first line, the first line-derived finished product serves as a control in some of the analyses. 
For this reason, the first line and R69 data are sometimes presented side by side. It is important to 
note that only rhFVIIa produced by the R69 line of transgenic rabbits has been developed for 
commercial purposes. 
There are different milk production sites, that function similarly and maintain the same high standards 
of animal health. All sites also function similarly with respect to the collection and handling of milk.  
The milk collected from transgenic rabbits carrying the hFVII gene is adequately controlled and is in 
line with the ‘Guideline on Quality of biological active substances produced by transgene expression in 
animals’. The transgenic status of the female production animals is confirmed during the initial 
lactation period. The health of the animals can also impact the quality of the milk and is controlled by 
the facilities in which they are housed and the procedures surrounding their care and testing. The 
source material is defined as an approved pool of milk from multiple animals and collection days. In 
general, milk is not tested as an individual sample other than to confirm transgenic status of female 
rabbits for use in production during their first (and sometimes second) lactation (these samples are 
only tested for the presence of a minimum amount of FVII in the milk). 
Mini-pools are grouped via a grouping strategy to identify the bottles required for a batch to create the 
source material. A representative composite is made prior to manufacturing and consists of 
volumetrically relative samples of the mini-pools comprising the source material bottle batch. The 
source material is defined as the pooled collection of mini-pools that when thawed makes up the 
volume required for a manufacturing run or batch.  
The source material is tested as a composite, and it must meet certain criteria for quality assurance 
(QA) approval and release prior to being further processed. Regarding the terminology, when released, 
the source material becomes starting material (SM). To release SM for use in manufacturing, testing 
must be successfully completed on the composite that corresponds to the SM batch. The methods used 
to release SM, performed on the source material composite have been adequately summarised and 
include: factor VII concentration, factor VII activity, milk protein profile, zoonotic agents (E. coli, 
Listeria spp., Salmonella spp.), adventitious agents, bioburden and bacterial endotoxins. These source 
material composite test and specifications have been justified and are acceptable.  
Finally, the results obtained through stability studies indicate that source material storage provides 
sufficient preservation of the source material for the manufacture of rhFVIIa of acceptable integrity and 
quality. The storage period at the recommended storage temperature is based on a combination of the 
SM and active substance testing results, balancing product yield with product integrity and quality.

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
This section describes the controls performed on the different process steps and intermediates. They 
include: 
•  Control of milk starting material, the first process intermediate obtained after thawing and pooling 
of milk source material. 
• 
In-process controls (IPCs) performed on the upstream process (USP), from milk source material to 
Intermediate Product (IP). The critical upstream process specifications are presented including step 
number, step, parameter/attribute, status (IPC/critical process parameters (CPPs)/critical material 
attributes (CMAs)), normal operating range (NOR), Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) results 
and viral clearance. 
•  Control of IP.  
• 
IPCs performed on the downstream process (DSP), from IP to LR769 active substance. The 
downstream process specifications are presented including step number, step, parameter/attribute, 
status (IPC/CPP/CMA), NOR, PPQ results and viral validation.  
The stability data and additional results which further confirm the observations from the previous 
studies, support the IP stability period.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Section 3.2.S.2.5 contains a presentation of the different studies which were conducted as part of 
rhFVIIa active substance process validation.  
The validation programme includes different stages of process validation, in line with the European 
Guideline EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014 on process validation for manufacture of biotechnology 
derived active substances. Thus, this section is organised in 3 sub-sections according to the different 
stages of process validation: 
•  Stage 1 Process Characterisation (evaluation): Section 1 contains the process robustness studies 
which were conducted at reduced-scale during the development of the process, in complement to 
the process evaluation studies described in Section 3.2.S.2.6. These studies were generated to 
enhance process knowledge, identify the links between process parameters and quality attributes, 
and establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for CPPs and CMAs.  
•  Stage 2 Process Verification (subsequent use: Process Performance Qualification (PPQ)): Section 2 
contains the results of the successive PPQ exercises performed at industrial scale.  
•  Stage 3 continued process verification (CPV): Section 3 contains a brief overview of the CPV 
programme. CPV will be implemented through continuous monitoring to ensure that the 
purification process of rhFVII remains in a validated state. 
Finally, shipping and transportation of source material, IP and active substance have been validated. A 
summary of these studies has been provided. 
In conclusion, the data reported support consistency in production.  
Manufacturing process development 
Section 3.2.S.2.6 Manufacturing Process Development provides a description of the different process 
versions that were used throughout the development of LR769, and a summary of the comparability 
exercise which was implemented to validate the changes. Furthermore, this section contains a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 17/137 
 
 
 
 
summary of rhFVIIa active substance batches manufactured during development in chronological order 
starting with pilot batches from Process A up to the late stage industrial-scale batches from Process B. 
Finally, the development of the control strategy is presented where the applicant argues that QbD 
principles have been followed but does not claim a design space.  
A first-generation product was obtained from a first transgenic rabbit line and purified by a standard 
purification process. Later in the development, a second-generation product, LR769, was developed 
from a new rabbit line (R69) with an improved genetic profile compared to the first-generation 
product. A brief comparison of characteristics of first with second generation product as well as a high-
level overview of process modifications introduced from first to the second generation is given, but no 
dedicated comparability was presented to compare the quality profile of both materials. The second-
generation process was developed at LFB to produce several pilot batches and then transferred to GMP 
facilities to produce first engineering batches and then further clinical batches. This process version 
was termed “Process A” and the GMP batches were used to supply clinical phase 1b and more than half 
of the pivotal phase 3 study. Later on, Process A was scaled up and further optimised to the proposed 
commercial Process B. Process B material was used for the second half of the pivotal phase 3 study. 
Process changes from Process A to Process B have been illustrated.  
A risk assessment exercise was conducted to evaluate the potential consequences of these changes on 
quality attributes of the active substance. The initial comparability exercise to compare Process A with 
Process B material was based on comparison of quality attributes which are release controlled either at 
IP or at active substance release. Comparability criteria have been established using a statistical 
analysis of the pre-change representative batch results whereas for quality attributes not impacted by 
the changes, compliance to acceptance criteria of normal batch release was considered as an 
appropriate way to demonstrate comparability. In addition, a more in-depth characterpaediatric of one 
single batch from Process A and one single batch from Process B was provided to further support the 
comparability claim. No comparative stability data (comparing the degradation profile and kinetics of 
Process A with Process B material was provided.  
At Day120 concerns regarding the quality comparability claim of Process A with Process B material 
were raised (Major Objection, MO). These deficiencies addressed the limited amount of in-depth 
characterisation data, the establishment of comparability criteria for quality attributes, which are 
controlled either at IP or at active substance release, and the presentation of the comparability data 
which made an adequate assessment difficult. 
To address these concerns the following further actions were performed by the applicant: 
a) Most importantly, regarding the comparison of in-depth characterisation data, the applicant has 
conducted an additional investigation including several clinical finished product batches manufactured 
from process A which were characterised in-depth and compared side by side with several clinical 
finished product batches manufactured from process B.  
All finished product batches have been used in the clinical phase 3 trial and have been manufactured 
from GMP, clinical and process validation active substance batches. The provided justification for 
conducting the in-depth characterisation on the finished product and not on the active substance is 
acceptable.  
This additional in-depth comparative characterisation work included standard and state-of-the-art 
techniques to compare the most relevant structural and functional quality attributes of the rhFVIIa 
molecule. The data derived thereof have been presented and indicate a comparable quality profile of 
material from Process A with material from Process B.  
b) & c) Regarding the comparability criteria for quality attributes, which are controlled either at IP or at 
active substance release the applicant has clearly outlined the strategy how comparability criteria have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 18/137 
 
 
 
been established. Comparability criteria were determined using the results of different active substance 
batches manufactured with Process A. Process A active substance batches used for setting of 
comparability criteria included all GMP batches as well as engineering batches, thus representing a 
sufficient large historical data set from Process A material. As requested in the Major Objection the 
individual results from all used Process A batches are given. For each compared quality attribute, a list 
of historical batches results used for comparability criteria setting together with the comparability 
criterion and its justification has been included. In certain cases specific Process A batches were not 
considered to accurately reproduce historical comparability criterion determination, the provided 
justification for exclusion of these batches is acceptable.   
It should be noted that in the MO at Day120 a recalculation of certain comparability criteria was 
requested, specifically for those comparability criteria which were wider than the release specifications. 
The applicant clarified that the comparability criteria were established tighter than or at least equal to 
the specifications in place for process A batches, none of the comparability acceptance criteria 
exceeded the release acceptance criteria applicable at the time of the comparability exercise. 
Specifications for the active substance have been updated throughout its development according to the 
modifications made to its manufacturing process and to the improvement of analytical methods. A 
tabulated summary of the comparability criteria set during the comparability exercise has been 
included into the response which compares them with the specifications in place at the time the study 
took place and current specification for the commercial product.  
Taking these arguments as well as the fact that a retrospective recalculation of comparability criteria 
would not change the conclusion on comparability the response of the applicant is acceptable. 
Finally, in addition to the results obtained from the first several Process B batches which have been 
already presented in the initial submission, data from additional Process B batches have been included 
into the comparability evaluation, thus enabling a sound comparability assessment based on a robust 
and sufficient data set. For each investigated quality attribute, a graphical presentation which shows 
the data distribution for process A and B batch results used during the initial comparability assessment 
as well as for the additional active substance Process B batches, is given. Furthermore, statistical tools 
were used to study data distribution in more detail. For most of the quality attributes the initial 
comparability results, a graphic representation of complete process B batches results present in the 
dossier and the TOST test confirm that data from Process A and Process B are comparable. Certain 
differences such as the 5% difference in the activated FVII methods could be sufficiently justified. 
In summary, the deficiencies with respect to the comparability evaluation could be considered 
adequately solved. Additional data have been provided which demonstrate a comparable quality of 
Process A with Process B material. As such the Major Objection has been resolved.  
Certain changes from Process A to Process B which were not included into the initial quality risk 
assessment in order to evaluate the potential consequences on quality attributes have been justified. 
No comparative stress stability data as recommended by ICH Q5E in order to compare degradation 
pattern and kinetics of Process A with Process B material were conducted. Instead, the applicant 
conducted a re-evaluation (including a head-to-head comparison) and provided a discussion of the 
available stability data from completed real-time/real temperature and accelerated stability studies 
performed for both, Process A and Process B material at active substance and product level. These 
discussions were performed to demonstrate a comparable stability profile of product whatever the 
process A or process B was used. The non-availability of comparative stress studies does not leave any 
uncertainties concerning comparability open. Consequently, this outstanding issue is considered 
solved. 
To date, starting material used to generate the active substance and finished product supplies for 
Phase 3 clinical studies has been supplied from one site using the same rabbit line. The overall 
Assessment report

comparability strategy to compare active substance produced from different milk collection sites is 
considered appropriate and sufficient to build up a robust quality bridge for the active substance 
produced from milk starting material from several milk collection sites. 
Furthermore, changes in the control strategy during the process development have been summarised. 
A summary of the comparative studies conducted for the transfer of analytical methods has been 
submitted. Finally, the specifications for rhFVIIa active substance have been updated throughout its 
development according to the modifications made to its manufacturing process and to the 
improvement of analytical methods. 
For development of the control strategy a combination of the traditional approach with inputs from the 
enhanced approach, mainly the implementation of quality risk management exercises and the use of 
process robustness studies through DoE was chosen. The resulting control strategy is based on 
traditional testing to meet established acceptance criteria. Although the applicant states that QbD 
principles have been used, no design space was derived from DoE studies. DoE studies were instead 
used to provide process knowledge and an adequate level of flexibility in conducting the process by 
establishing PARs for CPPs. In summary the development of the control strategy has been sufficiently 
described. 
Characterisation 
Recombinant human VIIa is a complex molecule composed of an N-terminal light chain of 152 AA and 
a C-terminal heavy chain of 254 AA held together by a single disulfide bridge (Cys135-Cys262). 
Recombinant human FVIIa possesses a modular organpaediatric with an N-terminal membrane-binding 
γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing domain, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and 
a C-terminal serine protease domain. The active protein contains 12 disulfide bridges and is 
glycosylated with two N-linked glycosylation sites and two O-linked glycosylation sites and the 
molecule contains γ-carboxylated glutamic acid residues (on its GLA-Domain). Consequently, a broad 
panel of standard and state-of-the-art analytical techniques have been used to characterise the 
molecule.  
Primary structure included confirmation of the amino acid sequence. Post-translational modifications 
were investigated and included N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, γ-carboxylation, β-Hydroxylation, 
phosphorylation.  
Secondary structure included characterisation of disulfide bridges. Higher order structures were 
studied. Molecular weight was investigated, molar extinction coefficient was determined, isoform 
profile and purity were also studied. Recombinant human FVIIa was also characterised  
Regarding the functional characterisation several in-vitro methods have been developed: Clotting 
activity of rhFVIIa was measured by the chronometric method using a commercial kit, activity of rhVII 
was determined with second assay termed the “amidolytic” assay but which is actually an FX activation 
assay. Furthermore, kinetic constants (Km and kcat) for FX and FIX activations were determined as 
well as the rate of inhibition of rhFVIIa by antithrombin via a kinetic inhibition assay. Binding to tissue 
factor was investigated by SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) technology, affinity parameters (Ka, Kd 
and KD) between TF and FVIIa were calculated. Finally, a thrombin generation time (TGT) test 
compared the capacity of the same antigenic quantity of FVII or FVIIa of various origins to generate 
thrombin in human plasma doubly depleted of FVII and FVIII or FVII and FIX.  
In summary, apart from the request to include a chromogenic activity assay to determine and compare 
the activated FVII activity of some batches it is agreed that structural and functional features of 
recombinant human VIIa have been extensively studied by different techniques. In addition, 
descriptions of the methods used specifically for structural and functional characterisation have been 
provided in this section. For subset of the functional assays, a brief summary of the qualification is also 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022

included; further information on the qualification/validation status of the methods used for 
characterisation of rhFVIIa has been submitted. Overall, it is agreed that the methods used for 
characterisation are considered suitable for their intended use. 
Regarding the impurities, the applicant has summarised and discussed the available information on 
rhFVIIa active substance impurities. rhFVIIa active substance impurities were classified according to 
their origin into three categories:  
• 
• 
• 
Impurities from the milk source material  
Process-related impurities (chemical leachables, and elemental impurities conducted in accordance 
with the ICH Q3D guideline – reference to the finished product section) 
Product-related impurities  
An appropriate discussion of these impurities has been included; for selected impurities an in-depth 
characterisation by using a combination of orthogonal analytical techniques has been conducted. The 
majority of the listed impurities are controlled either via routine release testing at active substance 
and/or intermediate (IP) level or as in-process control. For those impurities for which no routine 
release or in-process tests are in place a sufficient removal during the manufacturing process could be 
demonstrated. For potential chemical leachables; extractables and leachables studies were provided. 
Extractable studies were obtained from each component supplier and the corresponding leachable 
studies were designed from this information using extractable data relevant to LR769 process 
conditions.  
Finally, this section contains the description of analytical methods used to assay impurities (for those 
methods, which are not retained in active substance specifications). 
In summary, the section on impurities has been appropriately addressed. 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specifications cover appearance, identity, quality, potency, purity, impurities 
attributes. The active substance specifications include general quality attributes such as appearance, 
pH and osmolality, identity, bioburden and bacterial endotoxins, sialic acid content and the 
oligosaccharide profile. Furthermore, release control for purity/impurity-related quality attributes are 
included. Finally, rhFVII concentration as well as specific activity (calculated from rhFVII concentration 
and the clotting assay) are included for release testing. Rabbit FVII is controlled at the most 
concentrated step of the downstream process to improve method sensitivity.  
The specifications include release controls for relevant physicochemical and biological quality attributes 
and are considered adequate for a future batch release testing of bulk active substance foreseen to be 
processed to the commercial finished product. For release control a panel comprised of standard and 
state-of the-art methods is in place. A specific assessment and discussion of the analytical portfolio has 
been provided.  
rhFVIIa is a complex, highly post-translationally modified biomolecule, which gets activated by 
proteolytic cleavage, during its purification. It is composed of one light and one heavy chain, attached 
to each other by a disulfide bridge. 11 further disulfide bridges stabilise the higher-order structure of 
the protein. The active molecule carries two N-linked oligosaccharides and has two O-linked 
glycosylation sites. Close to its N-terminus, correctly processed FVII contains up to 10 γ-carboxylated 
glutamic acid residues. The protein has one phosphorylation site, and the aspartic acid at position 63 
gets ß-hydroxylated. Its secondary structure composed of α-helical, ß-sheet, ß-turn and randomly 
ordered moieties. Its interaction with Ca2+ triggers a major structural rearrangement, which is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 21/137 
 
 
 
mandatory for its biological action. Taken together, the control of the extraordinary complexity of the 
molecule needs to be reflected in the analytical portfolio used to assess quality relevant properties of 
rhFVIIa. 
The applicant proposed a complex methodological portfolio to assess and to control active substance 
quality. Some critical quality attributes of the API are analysed by orthogonal methods. rhFVIIa activity 
is measured by a clotting assay, which perfectly reflects its mechanism of action. A spectrophotometric 
assay is used to quantify protein strengths. The specific activity is calculated based on the ratio of 
biological activity and protein content. The applicant has demonstrated that the production process is 
able to efficiently clear Rabbit DNA far below the WHO threshold levels. Thus, host DNA is not assessed 
at active substance or finished product level and this is acceptable. Product related impurities like 
cleavage products, aggregates or degradation products are analysed. Eventually, N-linked oligo-
saccharide profile is analysed and oligo-saccharide structures were confirmed. The applicant provided 
solid arguments supporting the absence of galactose-alpha-(1,3)-galactose motifs on the active 
substance. Thus, the information about the glycosylation profile of the AS is acceptable.  
Taken together, this methodological portfolio gives a good insight into product purity and micro-
heterogeneity. Thus, several quality attributes are covered directly or indirectly by the proposed 
control strategy and active substance specification. The information provided is sufficient and 
adequate. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for active substance release were adequately described and validated.  
Regarding the method validation, non-compendial methods have been validated according to ICH 
Q2(R1). Respective validation reports and summaries have been provided. The validation data indicate 
that the proposed methods are suitable for the release quality control of active substance. The 
applicant provided sufficient evidence that the method developed to quantify rabbit milk proteins is 
valid for its intended use, since it recognises the majority of RMP’s present in his specific bulk harvest. 
The applicability of compendial methods to measure appearance, pH, osmolality, bioburden, and 
bacterial endotoxins was confirmed for rhFVIIa samples. This is acceptable. 
Batch analyses  
Two different sets of batch data are presented: primary batch analyses and supportive batches. 
Primary data are the batches from initial process performance qualification (PPQ) and industrial scale 
batches manufactured by the commercial manufacturing process (Process B). The supportive batches 
are those manufactured at industrial scale and pilot batches from Process A and B. The specifications 
for these batches were the specifications used at the time of their release. The description of the 
methods used for the testing of these batches is included in the dossier.  
Supportive batches from Process A and Process B were tested against the specifications used at the 
time of their release. Descriptions of historical analytical methods used for Process A and Process B 
active substance batches and summaries of their qualification/validation are included in this section. 
Although, most of the batches complied with the specification valid at that time, a few OOS values 
have been observed for batches from Process A. A brief explanation for these observed outliers is 
given.   
In summary, the batch release data indicate that  
• 
the current manufacturing process B is stable and able to deliver active substance material 
consistently meeting its predefined quality requirements and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 22/137 
 
 
 
• 
the applicant has gained a quite extensive manufacturing experience during the development of 
rhFVIIa. 
Acceptance criteria for routine release testing have been set either to regulatory requirements, with 
defined limits in pharmacopoeia monographs or guidelines, or established based on data recorded from 
clinical, non-clinical and PPQ batches. The specification limits reflect the process capability of the 
commercial process and are also clinically justified. The information provided is sufficient and 
acceptable. 
Reference standards and materials  
Appropriate information on reference standards used for testing of active substance and intermediate 
product has been provided. Distinct reference materials for the process-related impurities have been 
established: manufacture and purification or the purchase of these reference materials for testing on 
the aforementioned process-related impurities as well as the standard used in the amidolytic activity 
assay have been briefly described. Documentation of the characterisation, storage conditions and 
formulation supportive of reference materials stability has been also provided. Whereas the amidolytic 
standard is purchased from commercial kits, the rabbit milk protein standard and the rabbit FVII 
standard were produced in-house. For in-house standards, storage periods before retesting have been 
defined.  
Concerning the clotting assay (which is used as the potency release control for active substance and 
finished product), early potency (clotting) data was generated using a commercial kit. The internal 
standard was calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard and by 
using quality control samples, also supplied as part of the kit. After assay method revalidation, an 
internal standard was introduced in the clotting assay. The reference standard that is used to perform 
the potency analysis of active substance and finished product is PRS. This internal potency standard 
has been calibrated versus the WHO international standard. A yearly requalification will be performed. 
The strategy for future implementation of new internal clotting standards (in case that the current 
standard expires) as well as the strategy for continuity of the potency assignment of the internal 
reference standard, when the current WHO standard is replaced, has been presented. 
PRS is also used as the assay control for identity, oligosaccharide profile, activated FVII, monomer 
content, γ- carboxylation, cleaved, oxidised and non-Activated forms assays. The initial 
characterisation of the primary reference standard by methods used for active substance release and 
methods used for extensive characterisation has been conducted and is considered sufficient. An 
annual reference standard requalification programme has been implemented for PRS. In addition, the 
long-term stability protocol evaluates stability of the frozen PRS, the list of analytical tests to be 
performed annually is presented. Overall, the section on Reference Standards or Materials has been 
appropriately addressed.  
Container closure system 
An appropriate description of the container closure for both, the intermediate IP and active substance, 
has been provided. Intermediate product (IP) and formulated bulk active substance are stored frozen 
in heavy-walled durable bottles. The bottles are secured with a screw-cap closure. The container 
closure components are received pre-sterilised and comply with the Guideline on Plastic Immediate 
Packaging Materials (CPMP/QWP/4359/03), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993 
and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI requirements for plastics. A representative supplier 
product certificate is included in this section. 
Sterilisation of the container closure components is conducted by gamma irradiation. Reference to the 
performed leachables studies presented and discussed in the impurity section (3.2.S.3.2) is made.

Finally, a drawing with the dimensions of the bottle and the screw-cap closure is given. 
In summary, the section 3.2.S.6 on container closure system has been sufficiently addressed and no 
questions are raised. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
The stability studies are designed in accordance with ICH Q5C Stability testing of 
biotechnological/biological products. 
Based on forced degradation studies, the stability indicating methods were selected for long-term 
stability testing including visual appearance, identity, pH, osmolality, bioburden, bacterial endotoxins, 
activated FVII, monomer content, rhFVIIa concentration, and specific activity (calculated using the 
“rhFVIIa concentration” and the clotting activity results). 
Stability data for several validation batches manufactured are available. Further long-term stability 
data are available and have been presented. 
All these active substance batches met the specification limits within the tested time and the stability 
studies are ongoing. No obvious trends of degradation were observed. 
The proposed shelf life from the date of manufacture is supported by the submitted stability data. The 
containers had to be closed, protected from light in a freezer. 
All results comply with the specifications and no relevant trend is observed. The results are consistent 
with the previously submitted data.  
Based on the stability data the claimed shelf life from the date of manufacture of active substance 
manufactured with the commercial process is acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. It is supplied 
in vials (powder) with three dosage strengths (1 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg of eptacog beta (activated)) with a 
prefilled syringe (PFS) for the solvent (water for injections). The other excipients are: (powder): 
arginine hydrochloride, isoleucine, trisodium citrate dihydrate, glycine, lysine hydrochloride, 
polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid and (solvent): water for injections.  
All materials in contact with the product are commonly used in medicinal products and comply with the 
applicable compendial requirements. 
LR769 finished product and its solvent (WFI) for reconstitution, in a pre-filled syringe, are co-packaged 
with a sterile CE-marked vial adapter (VA), and accessories (plunger rod and the backstop). The 
syringe components comply with the applicable compendial requirements. 
The active substance and finished product formulation and composition are identical: arginine 
hydrochloride, isoleucine, glycine, lysine hydrochloride, trisodium citrate dihydrate, polysorbate 80, 
hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitrogen, and water for injection (WFI). Neither excipient is of human or 
animal origin nor novel excipients are used in the LR769 finished product formulation. The choice of 
excipients and their concentrations have been determined on the basis of stability of the active 
substance. The formulation development strategy was driven by the QTPP, and was based on former 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 24/137 
 
 
 
experience and knowledge. All excipients as well as their specification comply with compendial 
monographs, and all methods were verified according to the relevant monographs. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Appropriate formulation studies were performed to optimise the chemical and physical stability of 
LR769 finished product. Formulation development started with a pre-formulation screening study to 
evaluate the excipients contained in the original formulation and additional types of excipients, as well 
as small pH variations. A second formulation study was performed to justify the need for each 
excipient and to establish the appropriate concentrations. The justification of the formulation was 
conducted using a DoE approach to assess interactions between excipients. The different combinations 
of buffers and excipients were evaluated using stress conditions. 
LR769 is a sterile white to off-white freeze-dried powder which is intended for intravenous injection 
following reconstitution with sterile WFI to obtain the target concentration. There are no overages in 
the LR769 finished product. 
LR769 finished product was originally manufactured at low scale and stored frozen. A second-
generation product (Process A) was developed to improve purity and potency. It was designed 
according to QTPP and included major improvements. Two dosage forms of lyophilised product had 
been initially developed. Further improvements were introduced when manufacturing process was 
scale-up. 
These process modifications were subjected to a comparability exercise. According to the identification 
of all changes applied between processes, a risk assessment was conducted. Different relevant 
analytical methods were identified. Specific comparability criteria were established for these analytical 
methods. For the other quality attributes, compliance to product specifications was considered 
acceptable to demonstrate comparability. Results from these studies demonstrate that the process 
changes did not adversely impact the quality and safety of the finished product. 
Lyophilisation process was developed based on thermal characterisation on the three finished product 
dosage strengths by differential scanning calorimetry and microscopy. The performance of the 
industrial equipment was validated by empty chamber temperature mapping studies, while product 
uniformity was verified by extended sampling studies. 
The development of LR769 has been conducted following the QbD principles according to ICH 
guidelines Q8 to Q10, defining a QTTP and establishing the CQAs. The control strategy is based on 
traditional testing to meet established acceptance criteria with enhanced inputs from the process 
quality risk management and DoE studies. CQAs were identified and are properly controlled during the 
finished product manufacturing process. 
The LR769 1 mg/mL finished product primary container is a Type I borosilicate glass container, with 
closure and aluminium crimp seal with plastic flip-off cap. All components are Ph. Eur. compliant. The 
physical stability of the container closure and product quality was demonstrated by performing 
container closure integrity testing. The finished product packaging materials were evaluated for 
potential extractables and leachables using a risk-based approach. 
LR769 is compatible with each of the excipient materials and protects the finished product from 
moisture as indicated by stability data.  
In-use compatibility was demonstrated by evaluating the stability of the finished product on the 
reconstituted solution in vials in the upside-down position. The data from the compatibility study 
supports that the finished product is biochemically stable for up to 24 hours at 30°C ± 2°C.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 25/137 
 
 
 
For each dosage strength, the container contains after reconstitution sufficient solution to allow 
withdrawal of its labelled volume. After storage leachable concentrations were below the maximum 
acceptable concentration and these leachables do not represent a risk for the patient safety. A shipping 
validation of LR769 finished product vials and LR769 VAPFS kits was performed.  
Complementary studies demonstrate compatibility with the administration systems (vial adapter, 
syringe and infusion set). Photostability of the LR769 finished product in its secondary packaging 
planned for commercial supply was also demonstrated. 
LR769 is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder in single-dose glass vials and does not contain any 
antimicrobial preservative. The suitability of the container closure system to prevent microbiological 
contamination is demonstrated by the container closure integrity testing (CCIT) data, which was 
validated, and which is routinely applied and used as IPC on several vial samples, taken after each 
capping step. This is acceptable. 
Taken together, the choice of materials for primary packaging and its suitability for the intended use 
have been sufficiently justified.  
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The name, address and responsibilities of the manufacturing and testing sites for LR769 finished 
product have been provided. All the finished product manufacturing sites are GMP compliant. 
Manufacturing process 
The finished product manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. The manufacturing process 
to produce LR769 finished product is an aseptic fill-finish operation followed by lyophilpaediatric.  
The finished product production process is composed of nine steps: active substance thawing, pooling 
and mixing, first filtration, aseptic filtration, filling, lyophilpaediatric, capping, cap inkjet printing and 
finished product visual inspection, and packaging in bulk.  
Critical process parameters and their corresponding acceptance criteria for each individual process step 
are properly defined.  
Process and control of critical steps 
The CPPs acceptance criteria were established on the basis of data collected from Process Performance 
Qualification (PPQ) batches for the three dosage forms. Consecutive PPQ batches were performed for 
each finished product strength, at the intended market scale. Total processing time is not listed as 
CPP, but monitored and checked at the batch record level for each commercial batch, which is 
acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development 
The process was modified two times during clinical development:  
An initial version was used for Phase Ia clinical development, where the finished product was stabilised 
with a preliminary formulation and stored frozen. For later stage clinical development, a 
lyophilpaediatric process was developed and the finished product became available in two strengths. 
This process A was carefully designed in accordance with the QTPP. Further improvements in the 
finished product manufacturing process took place in parallel with the active substance scale up. This 
latest version is the manufacturing process for market supply. The diluent (WFI) container closure 
Assessment report

system was changed from a glass vial to a pre-filled syringe (PFS) and the vial adapter (VA) was 
changed accordingly to match the use of PFS to reconstitute the product.  
All changes of the production process were well described. A comparability exercise based on a risk 
assessment demonstrated that changes from process A to process B did not impact on finished product 
quality. 
All process steps were carefully designed and established in order to fulfil the QTPP, in order to 
increase its robustness and to minimise the risk of a potential impact on product quality. active 
substance thawing conditions were studied, optimised and justified. Sterile filtration also was 
developed based on product compatibility, extractables and microbial retention studies. Overfill of each 
dosage form was justified experimentally. The freeze-drying process was developed after having 
thoroughly characterised physico-chemical properties of the LR769 solution for glass, collapse and 
melting temperatures, as well as the lyophilised product for its glass temperature. The lyophilpaediatric 
parameters (pressure, temperature and duration) were developed and optimised for the freeze-drying, 
the primary drying and the secondary drying step, and for each dosage strength. Homogeneity of 
process conditions was verified on each tray under the authentic process conditions by placing 
temperature sensors in vials at positions representative for different zones in the lyophiliser. 
Stoppering conditions (gas, pressure) were investigated and set based on the QTPP. Detailed process 
characterpaediatric studies are reported. 
Taken together, critical process parameters were identified, and a robust finished product 
manufacturing process was designed and implemented. The manufacturing process development was 
well described and seems acceptable. 
Furthermore, the specifications for LR769 finished product have been updated throughout its 
development according to the modifications made to its manufacturing process and to the 
improvements of analytical methods. The specifications for commercial product were established 
according to the control strategy (CS) that was implemented from QbD principles. The control strategy 
was sufficiently explained. Acceptance criteria for commercial product were established according to 
the data recorded from clinical and PPQ batches.  
The manufacturing process used for clinical and PPQ batches will remain unchanged for commercial 
batches.  
Process validation 
The commercial manufacturing process was validated with different consecutive PPQ batches per 
dosage strength and different freeze-dryers. The process does not include any isolated process 
intermediates. The manufacturing process validation is supported by quality by design inputs, issued 
from the quality risk management exercise, according to ICH Q8(R2) and Q10 guidelines. A 
comparability exercise was performed between freeze-dryers based on the CPPs and performance 
comparison related to the critical parameters. No meaningful difference was found, and all freeze 
dryers are considered equivalent. The process validation covers the proposed batch size range for the 
three dosage forms. All acceptance criteria for CPPs, complementary monitoring parameters and 
finished product release criteria were met for all PPQ batches for all freeze-dryers. 
The applicant has reported all deviations detected during the process validation studies. They were 
investigated and have no impact in the process validation. 
Holding times were properly validated. 
All vials and vial components, as well as filling machine parts and other product-contact components, 
are properly prepared and sterilised. The whole process is carried out in qualified facilities, 
appropriately monitored, using qualified equipment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 27/137 
 
 
 
Data for cleaning validation (Section 3.2.A.1), filter validation (Section 3.2.P.5.5 and Section 3.2.P.2.3) 
and validation of disposable bags (Section 3.2.P.5.5) are included in other sections of the eCTD. 
Validation of the sterilisation equipment and components has been performed through heat penetration 
studies and distribution, using validation thermocouples and biological indicators. Different tunnel lines 
were validated, for the depyrogenation of LR769 vials. 
Media fill trials were conducted to determine the suitability of the filling configuration used in the 
aseptic filling suites for the three dosages forms. The aseptic process simulations were representative 
of the current process and were performed with the current filling production equipment under worst 
case production scale and operational parameters. 
Shipping validation studies were performed as two-step process, a first Operational Qualification step 
carried out in worst case conditions, and a final Performance Qualification considering the entire flow, 
climatic conditions (hot and cold period), and customs procedures which can influence the product 
transport. Results from these studies demonstrated that the shipping process and container system for 
the transportation of the LR769 (finished product vials, PFS and the whole kit) protect the integrity of 
the material and maintain the required temperature as confirmed by visual inspection, CCIT and 
temperature monitoring. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system of LR796 consists of Type I borosilicate glass containers, closures  and 
aluminium crimp seals with plastic flip-off caps. The container-closure information for all three dosage 
forms is well described for the glass vial and stoppers.  
Compatibility with the primary packaging material at long term storage conditions, as well as in-use 
compatibility with the reconstitution and administration systems have been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The information provided is sufficient and adequate. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The release specification for LR769 finished product covers all the required attributes, including 
appearance, pH, osmolality, reconstitution time, particulate matter, residual moisture, content, 
identity, purity, potency and safety (endotoxin and sterility), as well as excipients. The specifications 
for the three dosage strengths are the same except for residual moisture. The shelf life specifications 
are identical to the release specifications with some exceptions.  
The finished product formulation of LR769 is identical to the one of the active substance, no additional 
excipients are used in the manufacturing process of LR769 finished product and the most critical 
product quality attributes already specified at active substance level again are re-assessed with the 
same methods for finished product release at finished product level. Finished product specification for 
FP release and shelf life cover the complete set of finished product quality attributes. This is supported 
by stability data. Acceptance criteria, when identical between active substance and finished product, 
are adequately justified. All other acceptance criteria for analysis performed at finished product level 
only, were in line with compendial requirements or appear reasonable.  
Potential finished product process-related impurities were identified through a risk analysis. They were 
assessed by extractable/leachable studies. Results from these studies demonstrate that potential 
extractable materials are either below the limit of quantification (LOQ) or below the maximum 
acceptable concentration in LR769. Therefore, they do not pose any risk to patients’ health. 
In addition, elemental impurities were also assessed in accordance with the ICH Q3D guideline and 
their concentration was also below the maximum admissible concentration. Consequently, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 28/137 
 
 
 
presence of critical organic compounds and elemental impurities in LR769 finished product should not 
pose any risk to patients’ health. The information provided is acceptable.  
A risk assessment to evaluate the potential risk for the generation of nitrosamines in the intermediate 
product (IP), the active substance and the finished product manufacturing process was performed, 
concluding that the presence of nitrosamines in the FVII manufacturing process is unlikely. The risk is 
categorised as low and no further mitigation is required. This is acceptable. 
The acceptance criteria for finished product specification were established on the basis of data recorded 
from clinical, non-clinical and PPQ batches. Specifications were established according to regulatory 
requirements (Ph. Eur. monographs or guidelines) and stability indicating parameters. The specification 
limits are clinically justified and reflect the process capability of the commercial process. This is 
acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods are described and include compendial and non-compendial procedures. The 
LR769 finished product-specific (non-compendial) analytical methods are the same as those used for 
the active substance and were detailed in Section 3.2.S.4.2. The compendial analytical procedures are 
verified according to current Ph. Eur. Monographs. Analytical procedures used exclusively for the 
finished product specifications are sufficiently described. 
Each compendial method was verified for its suitability under the conditions of use, in accordance with 
current Ph. Eur. Monographs. Each LRT96-specific analytical procedure has been validated per ICH Q2 
(R1) as being suitable for its intended purpose. The performance characteristics of each method was 
evaluated against protocol-defined acceptance criteria. 
Validation reports were submitted for all non-compendial methods. Taken together, the validity of the 
methodological portfolio for its intended use was demonstrated. 
Batch analysis 
Several finished product batches were analysed. They cover PPQ batches (Process B) for all three 
dosage strengths and supportive batches manufactured from Process A or B and analysed according to 
the specifications in force at the time of their manufacturing.  
All batches gave comparable data and met the acceptance criteria for release. Taken together, it 
appears that the finished product manufacturing process is under control and able to produce LR769 
finished product of consistent and uniform quality. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard for the release of the finished product is the same as already described for the 
release of the active substance. 
Container closure system (CCS) 
The container closure system for all three finished product strengths was sufficiently described. 
Drawings of all vial and stopper sizes, as well as quality certificates were provided. In brief, the 
container closure system consists of Type I glass vials with closure crimped with an aluminium flip-off 
cap. All compounds which are in contact with the AS comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. The sterile 
vial adapter (VA) for reconstitution included in the secondary packaging is CE marketed. The CCS 
adequately protect the active substance from microbial contamination and moisture, as demonstrated 
in stability studies. Sterilisation and depyrogenisation of vials and stoppers have been sufficiently 
depicted in the process validation and evaluation section.

2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 3 years when stored below 30ºC is claimed for the finished product. 
The stability of LR769 finished product was evaluated according to ICH Q1A (R2), ICH Q1D and ICH 
Q5C guidelines.  
The applicant presented primary stability data from different PPQ batches in sufficient detail: several 
batches each for the highest and the lowest finished product strength, and other batches for the 
middle finished product strength were analysed. This bracketing approach seems reasonable. Stability 
was assessed at 4 storage conditions. The container closure system used is identical to the one 
intended for the commercial product.  
Stability testing was performed against finished product shelf-life specification. Methods were validated 
and identical to the ones used for the finished product release. Samples were assessed at finished 
product release at different time points afterwards. The whole stability programme was carried out in 
accordance with current ICH/CPMP guidelines. Long term storage was performed, which is highly 
endorsed.  
Stability data were presented and discussed in detail. After reconstitution, chemical and physical in-use 
stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at room temperature up to 30°C. The reconstituted 
solution should be stored in the vial. From a microbiological point of view, the product does not contain 
any bacteriostatic agent and must be administered within 4 hours after reconstitution. Any unused 
solution should be discarded 4 hours after reconstitution. 
Photostability studies conducted on several batches of the 1 mg dosage form (worst case format) in 
their primary and secondary packaging demonstrated that, although LR769 finished product in the 
primary packaging (glass vial) is adversely affected by exposure to light, it was adequately protected 
when exposed in the secondary packaging. 
Overall, the full set of long-term stability data generated throughout 48 months at three temperatures 
of storage on PPQ batches indicates a satisfactory stability profile in a temperature range from 5°C to 
30°C. This long-term real time data supports the proposed shelf life of 36 months at a temperature not 
exceeding 30°C. The proposed storage condition is: “Product packaged protected from light and stored 
at a temperature not exceeding 30°C for 36 months. The product should not be frozen since it is 
packaged with a WFI glass syringe.” 
Post MAA, the ongoing long-term studies will be continued according to their stability protocols. All of 
the above considerations were correctly reflected in the SmPC. 
Solvent - Water for Injections (WFI) 
WFI is provided in single dose PFS for reconstitution of LR769. The PFS containing WFI are supplied in 
three different sizes: syringes intended to deliver 1.1, 2.2 and 5.2 mL, which are packaged with the 1 
mg, 2 mg and 5 mg vials of LR769.  
The process used to produce WFI in bulk and sterilised WFI is based on techniques commonly used in 
industrial applications. These techniques meet the specifications given in the current Ph. Eur. 
monograph (0169). 
Sufficient information about the pharmaceutical development of sterile WFI LR769 finished product was 
provided. The presence of undesirable compounds has been evaluated during a long-term stability 
study. For the microbiological testing requirements of the relevant monographs (current edition) of the 
Ph. Eur. were followed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 30/137 
 
 
 
The validation results demonstrate that the manufacturing process consistently and reproducibly 
produces sterile WFI in PFS that fulfils all the specified criteria for the release of a sterile single dose 
product. Stability data showed that WFI is stable. 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
The manufacturing process of rhFVIIa includes four virus reduction steps that have been validated 
according to the regulatory guideline ‘Note for guidance on virus validation studies: the design, 
contribution and interpretation of studies validating the inactivation and removal of viruses’ 
(CPMP/BWP/268/95 (revised)) using relevant model viruses. Solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment, two 
chromatography steps, one nanofiltration step were examined as virus reduction step in the 
manufacturing process of rhFVIIa. The S/D treatment and the nanofiltration are the main virus 
inactivation/removal steps and the two further research manufacturing steps contribute to the virus 
reduction.  
The viral clearance studies were carried out at different laboratories in Europe. All submitted virus 
clearance studies are detailed and comprehensible. 
As a prerequisite to viral validation, it was demonstrated, that the scaled-down model is representative 
of the commercial manufacturing process. The performances of trials at reduced scale were compared 
to the representative batch performed at manufacturing scale. 
The solvent/detergent treatment was validated. The robustness of the S/D step was demonstrated for 
enveloped viruses under reduced concentration of S/D and reduced temperature. The operating 
conditions at small scale (viral clearance under normal and robustness conditions) and the current 
production scale are comparable. 
The solvent/detergent treatment showed effectiveness in the inactivation of enveloped viruses under 
the normal operating conditions. A further virus deactivation study for different operating S/D 
conditions were performed and virus reducing was also demonstrated under this robustness operating 
conditions of the process.   
Qualification of the one chromatography step at small scale was performed. The selected model viruses 
were effectively removed. Under robustness operating conditions and high-volume load the virus 
reduction capacity was also acceptable. The aged resin and volume load were shown to have no impact 
on the reduction capacity of the step. Nanofiltration as the main viral reduction step was very effective 
in the removal of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The robustness of this step was demonstrated 
by protein load, volume load, flow rate and volume of rinse which had no impact on the removal 
capacity of the step. 
The virus reduction by another chromatography step was further examined. Clearing of viruses was 
acceptable. The robustness of the step was also demonstrated using aged resin and high protein load. 
It could be shown that these operating conditions have no influence for the virus reduction capacity. 
Overall, with the submitted virus inactivation/clearance studies, the applicant could demonstrate that 
the manufacturing process of rhFVIIa is effective in inactivation/removal of a wide range of model 
viruses.  
Additionally viral sanitisation studies for the chromatography steps of the manufacturing process of rh-
FVIIa were submitted. The results from these studies demonstrated that the sanitisation procedures of 
the different columns are effective for the decontamination of a highly resistant non-enveloped virus 
and therefore more largely for other less resistant non-enveloped and enveloped viruses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022

The submitted risk assessment supports the conclusion that rhFVIIa manufactured by the process 
described herein has a sufficient capacity to remove potential viruses, if they were to be present. 
TSE 
Rabbits are non-TSE-relevant animal species (according to the ‘Note for guidance on minimising the 
risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal 
products’ (EMA/410/01, current revision). Additional safety measures have been implemented at the 
rabbit facilities e.g. the rabbits have no possible contact with other animal species and the rabbit feed 
is devoid from any animal-derived material. 
2.3.3.6.  GMO

2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
From a quality point of view a robust and well-controlled active substance and finished product 
manufacturing process has been set-up. An appropriate overall control strategy is in place which 
assures that only material fulfilling its predefined quality expectations will enter the market. This 
conclusion is further supported by conducted process validation results and a considerable amount of 
batch data from GMP batches manufactured during development. An extensive characterisation of 
product and its manufacturing process has been performed and indicates that the applicant has gained 
an in-depth knowledge of its process and product. A sufficient discussion of impurities including the 
risk evaluation for presence of nitrosamines at the active substance and finished product level is 
available.  
The manufacturing process used to produce the finished product is an aseptic fill-finish operation 
followed by lyophilpaediatric. The finished product composition corresponds to the one of the active 
substance, thus leaving only active substance thawing, pooling and mixing, sterile filtration, aseptic 
filling, lyophilpaediatric, capping and storage of the vials as the main procedures for the finished 
product, provided at three different product strengths. All process steps were carefully designed, 
established and validated. Acceptance criteria for the commercial product were established and 
justified according to the data from a considerable number of clinical and PPQ batches. The finished 
product shelf life of 36 months when stored below 30°C (protected from light and freezing) is claimed 
and justified by data from adequate stability studies. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Cevenfacta is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
as defined in the SmPC.  
The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, 
controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised and appropriate specifications are 
set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated.  
The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured.

Not applicable. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The biopharmaceutical development of Cevenfacta has been conducted in sequential phases as 
described in the Quality section above. Two manufacturing process versions were used during 
development, i.e. Process A  and Process B. A comparability assessment demonstrated that the 
products manufactured were biochemically indistinguishable. 
All nonclinical studies were performed with Process A product at the exception of the repeat toxicity 
study (Study 5000766) which was conducted with Process B product. The activity of LR769 (TGT, 
aPTT, PT) in human haemophilia A and B patient plasma study (Study 14 ENC 006) was conducted 
with both Process A and Process B product to demonstrate comparability between processes. 
The pharmacological activity of Cevenfacta has been assessed in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies 
summarised below. In addition, safety pharmacology parameters were assessed in GLP toxicity studies 
performed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacology 
In order to evaluate the specific pharmacodynamic activity of LR769 a comprehensive panel of in 
vitro assays was performed. These assays included amidolytic activity, activated FVII clotting activity, 
thrombin generation time, determination of kinetic constants for FX and FIX activation, inhibition by 
antithrombin and binding to tissue factor. In principle, Cevenfacta was found to be similar to the 
reference item NovoSeven with respect to these parameters. Please refer to the Quality Assessment 
Report for detailed discussion. 
The functional activity of Cevenfacta was further evaluated by in vitro determination of the potential 
for thrombin generation (TG) as well as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) (Study 0LFB12). Concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 μg/mL 
LR769 were employed for all assays. NovoSeven was used as reference product at the same 
concentrations in all assays. Whereas thrombin generation assays were performed with control plasma 
from healthy individuals, haemophilia A and B plasma (natural and artificial) without inhibitors, 
haemophilia A plasma (natural and artificial) with inhibitory antibodies as well as with double depleted 
FVII/FIX plasma, coagulation assays were only performed with natural plasma. Thrombin generation 
time (TGT) was assessed in the presence of tissue factor (TF) and phospholipids that serve as platelet 
substitute. In preliminary experiments the concentration of 1pM TF was determined to be ideal for the 
discrimination of concentration-dependent effects. With regard to endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) 
and thrombin peak (TP) a similar dose-dependent effect starting from the lowest dose of 0.5µg/L was 
observed for NovoSeven and LR769 in individual plasma samples. No statistical evaluation was 
performed, however, the TGT and TP of LR769 appeared to be slightly higher throughout all 
experiments with the difference increasing with increasing dose. The most distinct difference was

observed in two out of five haemophilia A donors with inhibitors. In addition, one of these plasmas had 
high ETP and TP baselines, which was explained by the applicant by mixing with artificial FVIII deficient 
plasma that was subjected to freeze drying and immune depletion. Coagulation was evaluated by 
determining PT, diluted PT (dPT) and aPTT. A shortening effect on PT and dPT was observed from the 
lowest concentration of NovoSeven and LR769 with no additional effect at higher concentrations. No 
difference between both compounds was determined. The highest change from baseline occurred in 
haemophilia B plasma, whereas the changes were similar in normal reference plasma, haemophilia A 
plasma and haemophilia A plasma with inhibitors. With regard to aPTT a dose-, however, not product-
dependent reduction was observed from the lowest concentration administered (0.5 µg/mL). Only a 
slight change from baseline was registered in normal reference plasma. Again, the highest change 
from baseline occurred in haemophilia B plasma, whereas the effect was less pronounced in 
haemophilia A plasma and haemophilia A plasma with inhibitors. Overall, NovoSeven and LR769 were 
demonstrated to have similar in vitro PD effects on TGT, ETP, TP, PT, dPT and aPTT in normal plasma 
as well as in haemophilia B plasma, haemophilia A plasma and haemophilia A plasma with inhibitors. 
In order to detect potential differences between Process A and Process B material, both of 
which were used in different in vivo toxicity studies, the applicant performed an additional in vitro PD 
study (Study 14 ENC 006). In this study commercial platelet poor plasma (PPP) from haemophilia A 
patients with or without inhibitors and haemophilia B patients were subjected to TGT, PT and aPTT 
assays with Process A and Process B material as well as NovoSeven as a reference. Within each plasma 
type all three compounds exhibited similar activity. Therefore, in vivo studies performed with both, 
Process A and Process B material, can be considered of comparable value for assessment.  
In vivo pharmacology 
In vivo pharmacology of Cevenfacta was evaluated using the tail tip bleeding method in 
haemophilia A mice, which have less than 1% of normal FVIII activity and, thus, prolonged bleeding 
time (11 TSS 003). The study was conducted with a pilot batch. Animals received 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 
mg/kg LR769. One minute after administration the tail was dissected and the tail tip was immersed 
into a vial containing 0.9% NaCl solution at 37°C. Endpoints analysed were the total bleeding time and 
blood loss over a period of 30 minutes. High inter-individual variability was observed with regard to 
bleeding time. Nevertheless, bleeding time and blood loss clearly decreased in a dose-dependent 
manner and statistically significantly differed from 0 mg/kg animals starting from 2 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg 
in bleeding time and blood loss, respectively. No wild-type animals were included so no conclusion on 
to which level of normal bleeding time and blood loss have been restored. In order to be able to 
compare the activity of LR769 with NovoSeven a study with identical setting was conducted using the 
marketed reference product (Study 11 TSS 002). Overall, both products showed similar efficacy 
regarding bleeding time and blood loss. No statistical differences could be determined between percent 
reduction of bleeding time and blood loss between Cevenfacta and NovoSeven. 
An additional PD study was conducted in haemophila A dogs bearing a mutation in the coagulation 
factor VIII gene, i.e. an intron 22 inversion separating exon 22 and exon 23, causing aberrant splicing 
and a stop in the transcription (Study 20110067SPGPB). These dogs have a maximum of 10% FVIII 
activity. Three haemophilia A dogs received a dose of 100 µg/kg LR769. A toenail-bleeding model was 
applied and bleeding time as well as blood loss were determined pre-dose as well as 10-15 minutes 
and 1h, 2h, 6h and 24h post dose for 30 minutes each. Normal dogs receiving saline were included as 
controls. PT was reduced in animals receiving LR769 as compared to pre-dose values with the most 
pronounced effect (reduction by 34%) observed at 10 minutes post-dosing followed by a decline and 
return to baseline at 24 h post-dosing. A less pronounced effect of LR769 was observed on aPTT (a 
maximum of 17% after 10 minutes). Of note, a reduction of 8% in aPPT was also observed in normal 
dogs receiving saline.

The potential thrombogenic activity of LR769 and NovoSeven was evaluated in a venous stasis 
model employing the Wessler method in rats (Studies 0LFB14 and Study 0LFB11). Ligatures were set 
at the vena cava of anaesthetised animals that were tightened 10 seconds after i.v. administration of 
0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg LR769 or NovoSeven, NaCl 0.9% as a negative control or Feiba (50 IU/kg) as a 
positive control. After 10 minutes of stasis the vena cava was incised and inspected for thrombus 
formation. In case a thrombus had formed, its size and weight was determined. Thrombus formation 
was observed in all of the Feiba-treated animals (Wessler’s score: 4.0±0.0 and mean weight: 19.7±3.3 
mg), whereas all animals that received NaCl were free from thrombi. All animals administered with 
LR769 developed thrombi with size and weight increasing with dose: Wessler’s score: 2.6±0.3, 
3.6±0.2 and 4.0±0.0, weight: 6.3±2.3, 10.3±1.1 and 18.6±2.5 mg. Similar results were observed in 
all animals - except for one animal of the 0.3 mg/kg group - treated with NovoSeven: Wessler’s score: 
2.6±0.4, 3.2±0.5 and 3.9±0.1, weight: 2.1±0.9, 12.1±3.8 and 15.3±2.2 mg). Statistical evaluation 
revealed no difference between thrombus size and weight comparing LR769 and NovoSeven. The 
occurrence of thrombi in all Feiba-treated animals and their absence in animals that received NaCl 
demonstrated the validity of the employed animal model. Overall, evaluation of the thrombogenic 
activity of LR769 revealed that the thrombogenic risk is dose-dependent and comparable to marketed 
FVIII products such as NovoSeven. 
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed.   
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were conducted. However, safety pharmacology data were 
collected during the rat and monkey GLP single and repeat toxicity studies.  
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of Cevenfacta was evaluated in a total of seven in vivo studies of which 
the two single dose studies in rats and monkeys were dedicated PK studies, the PK in dogs was 
analysed in the scope of a single dose PD study. In addition, TK parameters were reported in two 
repeat-dose rat and monkey studies each. 
A STACLOT VIIa-rTF in vitro assay was validated for quantitation of factor VIIa in citrated plasma with 
respect to calibration curve reproducibility, whole blood:anticoagulant ratio effect, selectivity, matrix 
evaluation (specificity), accuracy, precision, linearity of dilution (matrix effect) and stability. All 
acceptance criteria were met except for the stability of LR769 in prediluted rat plasma after storage at 
room temperature for up to 4 hours. 
Similarly, the STACLOT VIIa-rTF was also successfully validated for quantification of factor VIIa in 
citrated monkey plasma, however, with exceptions analogical to those in rat plasma. 
For the determination of LR769 in dog plasma after single administration an ELISA method was 
developed and validated.

For the detection of anti-rhFVIIa antibodies in rat and monkey serum specific electro chemiluminescent 
immunoassays were adequately validated. 
In addition, an assay to identify neutralising antibodies in rat and monkey plasma was established and 
validated based on potential inhibition of functional activity, i.e. reduction of clotting time in FVII 
deficient plasma. 
Single dose PK 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of Cevenfacta were evaluated after administration of single doses of 0.1, 
0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg in male Sprague Dawley rats at 5, 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 3, 6 and 24 
hours post-dose (Study 461867). 
In general, Cmax increased in a dose proportional manner when comparing the lowest dose to the mid 
dose and in a less than dose-proportional manner when comparing the mid dose to the highest dose. 
AUC(0-1h) and AUC(0-inf) were comparable and increased in a more than dose-proportional manner when 
comparing the 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg doses but decreased minimally from the 0.2 to the 0.3 mg/kg dose 
group. Of note, very high inter-individual variability was observed with regard to plasma levels in the 
mid-dose animals, thus, relativizing the value of the observation. Maximal exposure (tmax) was 
observed from 0.117 to 0.150h. The half-life (t1/2) was relatively similar throughout all dosing groups 
with values from 0.247 to 0.311. The volume of distribution (Vd) ranged well below the total body 
water of rats indicating limited distribution. Clearance (CL) ranged between 262 and 398 mL/h/kg. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were also evaluated in the scope of the toenail-bleeding PD study in 
haemophilia A dogs (Study 20110067SPGPB). For PK evaluation dogs were administered 0.1 mg/kg 
LR769. Cmax and AUC0-t were 0.888 µg/mL and 1.171 µg▪h/mL, respectively. Mean peak plasma of 
FVIIa activity was 1.079 µg/mL corresponding to 10.79 kg x mU/mL/U when dose-adjusted. Tmax was 
0.083 h and t1/2 was determined at 1.34 h. Overall, FVIIa antigen concentration and activity displayed 
a good correlation. 
For PK evaluation in Cynomolgus monkeys after a single dose, animals (3 female and 3 male) were 
administered 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day LR769 via i.v. bolus injection (Study 5000465). PK parameters 
were determined pre-dose and 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 6 and 8 hours post dose. In general, 
exposure increased with increasing dose in a more than dose-proportional manner. The maximum 
exposure (tmax) was determined to be at 5 minutes post-dose for most of the animals. T1/2 ranged from 
0.564 to 0.978 hours. CL was defined between 59 and 153 mL/hr/kg and Vd was 80.3 to 126 mL/kg. 
No gender differences regarding PK parameters could be identified in this study. 
Repeat dose TK 
In the scope of a 28-day GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in rats toxicokinetic parameters were 
evaluated (Study 504374). Animals were administered 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg LR769 daily and 
blood was collected at 5 and 15 minutes as well as 1, 2 and 6 hours after administration on days 1 and 
28. In general, exposure (AUC0-inf) increased roughly dose-proportional after the first administration 
and ranged from 0.117 to 5.83 µg▪h/mL. At day 28 LR769 was only detectable in the plasma of 
animals of the high dose groups (1.62 and 3.08 µg/mL), therefore, TK parameter could only be 
determined for these animals. Cmax was determined to be 0.164 to 6.98 µg/mL increasing with doses at 
day 1 and 1.53 and 2.94 µg/mL for the 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg group, respectively, at day 28. Similarly, 
t1/2 decreased with increasing doses with values between 0.416 and 0.814 hours at day 1 and 0.336 
and 0.200 hours for the two highest doses at day 28. In correlation to decreased exposure with 
increasing number of doses the Vd decreased from day 1 to day 28 from 492 to 300 mL/kg or 605 to 
281 mL/kg whereas CL increased over time in the highest dose group, i.e. 515 to 975 mL/h/kg. Anti-
drug antibodies (ADA) occurred with dose-proportional incidence throughout all dosing groups with 
90% ADA positive animals in the highest dose group.

TK parameters were also evaluated in the 25-day repeat dose toxicity study in rats (Study 5000172). 
Animals received daily doses of 6 and 11 mg/kg LR769 for 25 days. Blood samples were collected pre-
dose and 5 and 15 minutes and 1, 2 and 6 hours after the infusion on days 1 and 25. Cmax and AUC0-t 
increased with dose and time in a more than dose-proportional manner. The difference in Cmax between 
the 6 to 11 mg/kg dose was 2.5-fold on day 1 and 3-fold on day 25. AUC0-t was 3 times higher in the 
11 mg/kg group than in the 6 mg/kg group on day 1 and 3.6 timer higher on day 25. AUC0-t increased 
within dosing groups by a mean of 3.12-fold at the 6 mg/kg level and a mean of 3.55-fold at the 11 
mg/kg level. T1/2 ranged from 0.433 to 0.696 h. CL generally increased with time and dose and was 91 
to 507 mL/h/kg. The Vd ranged from 291 to 328 mL/kg in all study groups and was only lower, 94.6 
mL/kg, in the 11 mg/kg group at day 25. As these values are well above the total blood volume of a 
rat, distribution beyond blood vessels is conceivable. 
TK was further evaluated in the GLP-compliant 28-day repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomologus 
monkeys (Study 504376). Animals were administered 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg LR769 daily for 28 
days (Study 504376). Blood samples were collected pre-dose and 5 and 10 minutes and 1, 2 and 6 
hours post dose on days 1 and 28. The duration of availability of LR769 in the plasma of treated 
animals was dose-dependent and reached 6 h for all but the lowest dose. Tmax was 5 minutes for all 
dosing groups at day 1 and 28. Cmax increased in a dose-dependent manner with a roughly dose-
proportional increase from 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg. The Cmax values were similar between day 1 and day 28 
within the particular dosing groups and ranged from 0.629 to 34.6 µg/mL. Similarly, AUC0-inf and AUC0-
t increased in a dose-dependent fashion and roughly dose-proportional from 0.3 to 3.0 mg/mL and 
again similar values were calculated for the day 1 and day 28 time point within one dosing group. Only 
in the highest dosing group both AUC values were elevated on day 28 as compared to day 1, i.e. 34.9 
vs. 46.6 µg▪h/mL and 34.6 vs 44.8 µg▪h/mL AUC0-inf and AUC0-t, respectively. T1/2 increased with dose 
from 0.509 to 0.916 h on day 1 and from 0.737 to 1.28 h on day 28. CL declined from 106 to 86.5 
mL/h/kg over all dose ranges on day 1 and did not follow a dose-dependent pattern on day 28, the 
latter of which was presumably due to very high standard deviations especially in the 0.3 mg/kg dose. 
Considering high standard deviations the Vd was comparable among all dose groups at both time 
points and ranged from 103 to 175 mL/kg.  
Also the GLP-compliant 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in male and female cynomolgus monkeys 
included evaluation of TK parameters (Study 5000766). Animals were administered daily infusions of 
0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/mL LR769. Blood samples were collected on days 1, 28, 56 and 91 at time-points 
between 5 minutes and 9 hours. Tmax was between 5 and 10 minutes for all dosing groups throughout 
study duration in male and female animals. Cmax and AUC0-inf increased with dose and was in a 
comparable range for both genders. Whereas exposure remained at a similar level in all dosing groups 
throughout the entire study period in male animals, a decrease in exposure was observed in the 
highest dose group of female animals. T1/2 was similar in both genders for all doses and time points 
and ranged from 0.346 to 1.63 h. CL highly varied throughout the study period in male animals with 
no obvious relation to dose and time point. In female animals a correlation between number of doses 
and CL could be observed. Similarly, Vd changed frequently without following the dose or number of 
administrations in male animals. In females Vd appeared to increase with dose and number of doses. 
Analysis of gender ratios with regard to exposure did not identify any gender differences but overall, a 
higher exposure in male animals except for day 1, 28 and 91 of the 0.1.mg/mL group, where exposure 
was higher in females.  
The effect of food consumption on absorption was not evaluated for Cevenfacta. 
Distribution or protein binding as well as placental transfer were not evaluated for Cevenfacta.  
Furthermore, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not analysed.

2.4.4.  Toxicology 
In order to investigate potential toxicity exerted by Cevenfacta, the applicant submitted a total of two 
single-dose and four repeat-dose toxicity studies as well as one fertility and reproductive performance 
study. Local tolerance and antigenicity were evaluated in the scope of other toxicity studies. A separate 
predictive in vitro immunogenicity studies was conducted with human PBMCs. 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
A GLP-compliant single dose toxicity study (Study 504374) was performed in male Sprague Dawley 
rats as a part of the 28-day repeat dose toxicity study. Animals received 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg 
LR769. Parameters evaluated included clinical signs, body weights, body weight changes, food intake, 
clinical pathology parameters (haematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry), male reproductive 
functions, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations. Details on the 
toxicokinetic parameters are discussed in the Quality section above. No test-article related mortality 
was reported for this study. Platelet counts and prothrombin time decreased in dependence on dose 
and time as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic activity of LR769. Minimal vascular thrombosis at 
the site of administration was observed in the three lower dosing groups, which was attributed to the 
catheterisation. The absence of thrombi in the highest dose group suggests the potential involvement 
of mechanical contribution by the infusion procedure to these observations. Apart from that, no 
changes in any of the investigated parameters were detected. 
A second GLP-compliant single dose toxicity study was conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys that 
received doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg LR769 and were necropsied two days after administration 
(Study 504376). Animals were evaluated for clinical signs, body weights, body weight changes, food 
intake, clinical pathology parameters (haematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry), gross 
necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathology. TK parameters were determined and are 
discussed in detail in the quality section above. No deaths, clinical signs, body weight changes or 
alterations in food consumption were observed. Moderate, however, statistically significant shortening 
of prothrombin time was observed in all dosing groups from 30 to 90 minutes and in the three groups 
that received the highest doses also at 6h, thus, indicating a clear dose response. A transient decrease 
in fibrinogen levels was observed in the 1.0 mg/kg group at 60 and 90 minutes and in the 3.0 mg/kg 
group at 30 min pointing only vaguely towards a dose-effect relationship. No related microscopic 
observations were made. In addition, alanine aminotransferase was transiently elevated in one single 
male animal and considered of no relevance for the overall safety profile due to the isolated 
observation. Moderate increases in creatine kinase were observed in control animals and in monkeys 
that received doses of more than 0.1 mg/kg, which was attributed to potential procedure-related 
myocyte damages by the applicant. No changes with regard to gross pathology, organ weights and 
histopathology occurred. Overall, Cevenfacta can be considered well-tolerated in this study. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In a GLP-compliant 28-day repeat dose toxicity study in male Sprague Dawley rats animals were 
administered 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/day Cevenfacta (Study 504374). A part of the animals was 
necropsied immediately after the dosing period and some animals after a 14-day recovery period. TK 
parameters were determined and are discussed in detail in the quality section above. Overall, no 
Cevenfacta-related effects on body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical chemistry 
parameters, organ weight or microscopic findings were observed. Transient, dose-dependent decrease 
in activity was reported for animals treated with doses starting from 0.3 mg/kg. A dose-related 
decrease in prothrombin time and platelet counts was also noted in animals starting from a dose of

EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 38/137 
 
 
 
0.3.mg/kg, which is probably attributable to the mode of action of Cevenfacta. In addition, reversible 
increases in white blood cells, neutrophils and monocytes were reported, however, these findings did 
not follow a dose-dependent pattern. Vascular and perivascular inflammatory infiltrations associated 
with thrombosis of variable manifestation was observed at the infusion site of animals of the control 
and treatment groups with an increase in incidence and severity with increasing dose. These findings 
persisted through the end of the recovery period in control and treatment groups and can therefore be 
attributed also to the trauma by infusion and not entirely to the test-article. In the 3.0 mg/kg dose a 
single case of a brain thrombus and two cases of pulmonary haemorrhage were observed. Although 
the applicant argues that the lung haemorrhages are most probably incidental, the accumulation of 
these three cases in the highest dose group should not be ignored. Reflecting the findings in this study, 
the applicant determined the local no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) to be 1.0 mg/kg/day (on 
Day 28 mean Cmax value of 1.53 μg/mL and mean AUC0-inf value of 1.62 μg▪h/mL) and based on the 
absence of systemic toxicity, the systemic NOAEL to be equal to or greater than 3.0 mg/kg/day (on 
Day 28 mean Cmax value of 2.94 μg/mL and mean AUC0-inf value of 3.08 μg▪h/mL). Anti-Cevenfacta 
antibodies were detected in the plasma of virtually all animals at day 29 and were of neutralising 
character.  
In a second repeat-dose toxicity study in rats animals were administered 6 and 11 mg/kg LT769 for 25 
consecutive days (Study 5000172). A part of the animals was examined on day 26, the remaining 
animals were investigated after a 14-day recovery period. TK parameters were determined and are 
discussed in detail in the quality section above. No deaths or test article related effects on body 
weights, food consumption, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters were observed in the main or 
recovery study. Three deaths in dosing groups occurred in the TK study, however, the cause of death 
could not be determined at the necropsy. Decreased activity was observed in animals that received 
Cevenfacta with dose-related incidence and severity. Protruding penis was observed on several 
occasions in two animals in the high dose group with unclear significance of this finding. With regards 
to coagulation parameters, prothrombin time was reduced in all Cevenfacta-treated animals at a 
comparable rate on day 1 but not at other time points analysed as a result of the pharmacological 
effect. No changes of PT, aPTT or fibrinogen related to control animals were observed at the end of the 
treatment or recovery period, respectively. In the 11 mg/kg group several changes as compared to 
control animals in haematology parameters were observed at the end of the treatment period. These 
included decreases in platelet counts, mild increases in lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte and 
leukocyte counts in one animal, decreases in platelet counts accompanied by haematopoiesis of 
megakaryocytes in the sternal bone marrow in one animal and the presence thrombi. Minimal decrease 
in red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit as well as moderate increases in platelet counts at the 
end of the recovery period i the high dose group were interpreted as a result of regenerative processes 
and not attributed to the test article by the applicant. Organs that exhibited pathological changes were 
abdominal blood vessels (caudal vena cava), kidney, lung, testis and epididymis. Microscopic 
examination identified foci of renal necrosis as a result of infarction in the 11 mg/kg group, thickening 
and thrombosis at the infusion site in both dose groups, dilated abdominal blood vessels related to 
thrombosis of adjacent vessels or as a consequence of impaired venous blood flow due to thrombosis 
at the infusion site and mild inflammation of and around pulmonary vessels combined with mild 
thrombosis. Small testis with diffuse degeneration together with small epididymis and oligo/aspermia 
were observed in one animal of the high dose group. Various of these pathological changes persisted 
until the end of the recovery period. These non-reversible changes were the thickened infusion site 
associated with marked thrombosis in both treatment groups, dilatation of and marked thrombosis in 
abdominal blood vessels (11 mg/kg), decrease in testis and epididymis weights including 
oligo/aspermia (11 mg/kg), minimal to mild lung thrombosis in both groups and severe thrombosis in 
the hepatic vein (6 mg/kg). As a consequence of marked and persistent thrombosis observed in 
Assessment report

various organs in animals of both dosing groups the establishment of a NOAEL was not possible for this 
study. 
A 28-day repeat dose toxicity study with a 14-day recovery period was conducted in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (Study 504376). Animals received daily infusions of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg Cevenfacta. 
TK parameters were determined and are discussed in detail in Section 3.2.2 of this report. No 
unscheduled deaths, clinical signs or effects on body weight or food consumption were observed. In 
addition, no ophthalmic changes or deviations from normal cardiac rhythms were noted. A moderate 
decrease in platelet counts associated with microscopic thrombosis of the endocardium of the right 
ventricle was observed in one animal of the highest dose group. Moreover, prothrombin time was 
decreased on day 1 for up to 90 minutes in all dosing groups. This observation was prolonged to 6h 
post-dose on day 1 starting from the 0.3 mg/kg group. Thus, a dose response relationship can be 
attributed to this effect. In addition, a transient decrease in fibrinogen was observed in animals that 
received doses of 1.0 mg/kg and higher. Alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase activity mildly 
and transiently increased in animals given 0.3 mg/kg or ≥ 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. As creatine kinase 
activity was also increased in control animal it was attributed to trauma by infusion and not considered 
Cevenfacta-related. Apart from that, a nodule associated with thrombosis was detected after the 
recovery period in the right ventricle of an animal that received 3.0 mg/kg that was considered test 
article related. All animals developed anti-Cevenfacta antibodies during the dosing period and virtually 
all of these antibodies were of neutralizing character. The NOAEL for this study was set at 1.0 
mg/kg/day corresponding to a mean Cmax of 9.18 μg/mL and mean AUC0-inf of 10.3 μg.h/mL on Day 
28. 
A second repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys that 
involved daily infusion of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg Cevenfacta for 13 weeks and, for a part of the 
animals, a 14-day recovery period. TK parameters were determined and are discussed in detail in the 
quality section above. No unexpected deaths or effects on body weight and food consumption were 
observed in animals treated with Cevenfacta. In addition, no ophthalmic changes, changes in blood 
pressure and electrocardiographic parameters were observed. Prothrombin time was decreased up to 
30 minutes post-dose in all dosing groups as a consequence of the pharmacodynamics of Cevenfacta. 
This effect decreased with increasing number of administrations predominantly in females and 
correlated with faster systemic elimination. A decrease in aPTT was noted on day 28 30 minutes post-
dose in male animals of the 1.0 mg/kg group. However, due to the isolated character of this finding it 
can presumably be considered incidental. Increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in one 1 mg/kg male were also rated 
non-adverse. All animals developed neutralising anti-drug antibodies. The NOAEL in this study was ≥ 1 
mg/kg/day (Cmax of 11.200 and 4.260 µg/mL and AUC0-inf of 13.500 and 3.250 µg▪hr/mL in males 
and females, respectively). According to the applicant, this corresponds to a safety margin of 4.6 for 
males and 1.7 for females considering a human dose of 900 µg/kg/day and the resulting Cmax of 2.4 
µg/mL. 
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed in line with the relevant ICH S6(R1) guideline. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed in line with ICH S6(R1) guideline that discourages the 
conduct of standard carcinogenicity studies for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals.

2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A GLP-compliant fertility and reproductive toxicity study was conducted in male Sprague Dawley rats 
that were administered 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg daily. Dosing started 28 days before cohabitation 
and continued until a total of 46/47 doses or 55 doses, respectively. Three deaths occurred in this 
study one of which was probably attributable to the test item due to infusion site mass secondary to 
Cevenfacta administration. Apart from that no clinical signs, effects on body weight or food 
consumption were noted. Also organ weights and sperm counts were comparable to control animals. 
No microscopic abnormalities were detected in the testis, which indicated no effects on the 
spermatogonic cycle. Days to mating, mating, fertility indices and conception rate were comparable to 
control animals and, thus, not affected by the test article. Similarly, female animals paired with treated 
males had similar numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live embryos, dead embryos, early 
resorptions as well as pre- and post-implantation losses when compared to control animals. Animals 
treated with doses of 1.0 mg/kg and higher had a comparatively high incidence of masses, thickening 
and firmness at the infusion sites. It was concluded that the NOAEL for male fertility and reproductive 
performance can be determined to be 3 mg/kg/day. 
No embryo-foetal and pre- or postnatal development studies as well as juvenile toxicity studies were 
conducted with Cevenfacta. 
2.4.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance study was performed but macroscopic and microscopic injection site 
analysis was included in single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in monkeys. Rats developed occasional vascular inflammation after single administration and 
irreversible thrombosis when administered 3.0 mg/kg. An aggravation of these findings was observed 
after repeated administration of vehicle or Cevenfacta with dose-dependent increase of severity with 
two cases of thrombi with necrotic centre in the highest dose group. Events such a minimal to 
moderate thrombosis and perivascular haemorrhage persisted throughout the recovery period in 
control as well as test animals (3.0 mg/kg) and are likely to be at least partly attributable to 
mechanical trauma at the infusion site. No such observations were made in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.4.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Anti-Cevenfacta antibodies were detected after multiple administrations in repeat dose toxicity studies 
in rats and monkeys (Studies 504374, 5000172, 504376 and 5000766). These anti-drug antibodies 
were of neutralising character. Based on the high homology between human and primate FVII it was 
investigated whether the anti-drug antibodies developed in response to Cevenfacta administration also 
recognise primate FVII. Indeed, it was confirmed that the primate ADA are capable to neutralise 
primate FVII and to inhibit its coagulant activity, which became clinically evident by increased 
prothrombin time. As animal studies are not considered predictive for clinical immunogenicity a 
predictive in vitro immunogenicity study (EpiScreenTM) was performed. CD8+ T cell depleted 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a cohort of 50 donors were cultured in the presence of 
Cevenfacta or NovoSeven for 8 days. Potential clinical immunogenicity expressed by a CD4+ T cell 
response was evaluated by T cell proliferation ([3H-thymidine uptake] and IL-2 production (ELISpot). 
Based on the results of this in vitro assay a low clinical immunogenicity is predicted for Cevenfacta. 
Immunotoxicity, dependence and metabolism were not evaluated for Cevenfacta as not considered 
relevant for a product of this type.

Considering rabbit’s milk as the platform for Cevenfacta production, it is conceivable that related 
impurities such as soluble rabbit’s milk proteins and colloidal rabbit’s milk proteins are potential 
impurities of the drug substance. The presence of such protein impurities was indirectly analysed by 
detection of antibodies directed against rabbit whey or casein in the serum of rats and monkeys that 
repeatedly received Cevenfacta. Out of 15 rat and 51 monkey samples only one rat sample was 
reactive to rabbit casein. Thus, although not necessarily predictive for any human immune response, 
the presence of impurities originating from rabbit’s milk could not be determined on the non-clinical 
level.  
The applicant provided a comprehensive risk assessment on the safety and toxicity of the excipients 
present in the drug product after reconstitution for use. These excipients are largely naturally occurring 
amino acids for which a sufficiently high safety margin will be met. The content of Polysorbate 80 will 
also be well below the permitted daily exposure. A mixture of the excipients equal to the formulation 
buffer was used as vehicle control in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys and can 
therefore be considered qualified. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Cevenfacta is a recombinant human FVII protein. Due to its similarity to the endogenous human FVIIa 
and it be considered a naturally occurring protein and the submission of ERA studies is not warranted 
as stated in the EMA Guideline “Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use” 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2., Cevenafcta is not considered to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic characterisation revealed comparable functionality of Cevenfacta 
and NovoSeven in all studies. In vitro, Cevenfacta increased thrombin generation and decreased 
coagulation parameters. In vivo, Cevenfacta efficiently reduced blood loss and bleeding time in 
haemophilia A mice and dogs. Moreover, thrombogenicity was comparable to NovoSeven.  
An in vitro comparison of Process A and Process B material revealed functional similarity between the 
batches employed for this assay. Of note, this in vitro comparison only reflects functional properties of 
the batches but can hardly provide any information on e.g. potential pharmacokinetic differences due 
to formulation differences that might play a role in an in vivo setting. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic properties of Cevenfacta were evaluated in a total of three single 
dose and four repeat-dose studies in rats, dogs and monkeys.  
After a single dose exposure increased in a roughly dose-proportional or more than dose-proportional 
manner. 
After repeated administration (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) for 28-days in rats exposure was also 
dose-proportional after the first administration but decreased over time so that Cevenfacta was only 
detectable in animals of the high dose group at the end of the administration phase. Since 90% of 
animals were ADA positive, the decrease in exposure with time is very likely attributable to the 
development of ADA that have been demonstrated to be of neutralizing character. When higher doses, 
6 and 11 mg/kg, were administered, exposure increased more than dose-proportional, i.e. more than 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 42/137 
 
 
 
 
3-fold, over time. 
Of note, AUC0-inf for the 3.0 mg/kg dose was lower after repeated administration of Cevenfacta on 
day 28 of Study 504374 in rats than on day 1, Cmax was lower at the end of the study period for the 
1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg dose. Thus, exposure appeared to decrease after repeated-administration in rats. 
In contrast, exposure generally increased in Study 5000172 until day 25 when 6 or 11 mg/kg were 
repeatedly administered. ADA were detected in animals of both studies, but appear not to have 
negatively influenced exposure in the high dose study.  According to the applicant’s argumentation 
different dose levels and, as a consequence, saturation of various elimination pathways might account 
for that observation, which is considered plausible. 
In monkeys exposure was dose-dependent and remained constant throughout the study period of 28 
days. Similarly, the level of exposure remained comparable throughout the 13-week repeat dose study 
in male and female monkeys with the exception of the high dose group of female monkeys that had 
decreased exposure over time. This observation correlated well with the occurrence of ADA that, 
although detected in all animals that had received Cevenfacta, were present at higher titres in females. 
Of note, a relatively low number of animals was employed in these studies and a high SD was 
observed. Thus, the study results have to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, exposure of 
monkeys that received 0.3 mg/kg was comparable to haemophilia A and B patients that received 0.225 
mg/kg. 
Toxicology 
Overall, Cevenfacta was well tolerated in all toxicity studies by rats and monkeys. General 
observations made in all toxicity studies were decreases in prothrombin time and platelet counts 
shortly after administration. Observed adverse events were largely limited to rat studies and in general 
attributable to exaggerated pharmacology. These events included local perivascular inflammation and 
thrombosis at the infusion site and deteriorated with increasing dose. As such observations were also 
made in control animals, a partial relation to trauma by catheterisation is also conceivable. Systemic 
effects were observed in rats at doses of 6 and 11 mg/kg/day. Thus, thrombosis partly associated with 
necrosis was observed in several organs such as abdominal blood vessels, kidney, lung, testis and 
epididymis. Some of these findings proved to be irreversible after the recovery period in both dosing 
groups. Thus, the applicant’s approach to establish the local NOAEL at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day and 
the systemic NOAEL at 3.0 mg/kg/day is accepted. Of note, virtually no exposure margin to 
haemophilia A and B patients is established with regard to Cmax and AUC0-inf for the 1.0 and 3.0 
mg/kg/day dose in rats. 
Adverse events were less pronounced in Cynomolgus monkeys. Only one serious test-article related 
event was observed after repeated administration (28 days) of 3.0 mg/kg/day, which was a nodule 
associated with thrombosis in the endocardium of the right ventricle that was discovered after the 
recovery period. This event occurred at approximately the 15-fold exposure of that reported for 
patients receiving the 0.225 mg/kg dose. Therefore, the NOAEL for monkey studies was determined at 
1.0 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to an exposure margin of 5 to the clinical exposure at a dose of 
0.225 mg/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed in line with the relevant ICH S6(R1) guideline which is 
considered acceptable. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed in line with ICH S6(R1) guideline that discourages the 
conduct of standard carcinogenicity studies for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. This is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022

considered acceptable. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No effect of Cevenfacta was observed on male mating and fertility as well as conception rate at doses 
of up to 3 mg/kg/day.  
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance study was performed but macroscopic and microscopic injection site 
analysis was included in single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in monkeys. 
Immunogenicity 
All experimental animals of the repeat-dose toxicity studies developed anti-drug antibodies, which 
were of neutralising character and also recognised primate FVII. Thus, coagulation in Cynomolgus 
monkeys was impaired as expressed by an increase in prothrombin time after repeated administration 
of Cevenfacta. In order to predict patient immunogenicity, an in vitro assay employing human CD8+ T 
cell depleted PBMCs was utilised. This assay predicted low immunogenicity for Cevenfacta, which was 
indeed confirmed in clinical studies. 
The presence of impurities from rabbit’s milk was indirectly analysed by evaluating a potential immune 
response against rabbit whey and casein in rat and monkey serum. Of note, it is conceivable that also 
various components other than whey or casein represent potential impurities originating from rabbit’s 
milk might be present in the drug product. Therefore, the applicant’s approach is supportive, but of 
rather limited significance. 
It is remarked that a huge variety of batches has been used for the non-clinical studies, even up to 
three different batches within one single study, which is not considered an ideal setting. However, the 
applicant argued that, although doses were based on the total protein content, inter-batch variabilities 
regarding purity did in general not exceed 10%. Thus, and considering that supra-physiological doses 
of FVII have been administered, a disadvantageous effect by using various batches for one 
experiment, is not conceivable. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, eptacog beta is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment. 
Considering the above data, eptacog beta is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
All findings in the preclinical safety programme were related to the pharmacological effect of rFVIIa. 
Overall, the applicant provided a comprehensive panel of non-clinical pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies in order to support the MA of Cevenfacta.

Clinical phase 1b study was conducted with Process A product, while the phase 3 studies used both 
Process A and Process B or process B only products. 
2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical studies with a PK component 
Three studies with a clinical pharmacology component were conducted with Cevenfacta. Patients did 
not have an active bleeding at that time and had not receive treatment with any FVII(a) product within 
24 hours prior to this administration. 
Study GTC-FVIIa-005-11 was a Phase 1b, dose escalation study to assess the safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Cevenfacta across three dose levels (25, 75, 
and 225 μg/kg) in a total of 15 adult male patients (mean age 33 years, range 20-61 years) with 
congenital haemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. PK data were analysed using non-
compartmental methods and population PK modelling. 
Study RB-FVIIa-006-13 (PerSept1) was a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised, crossover 
study in patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors.  
Patients received a single intravenous administration of either 75 μg/kg or 225 μg/kg of Cevenfacta as 
a bolus injection within 2 minutes. For PK evaluations, blood draws occurred at baseline (prior to 
Cevenfacta administration), 10±2 minutes, 30±5 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours (±10 minutes) 
relative to the start of infusion of study drug. A repeat of the PK analyses was done in the same 
patients 3-6 months after the initial PK assessments (Process A), but with the product obtained from a 
scaled up manufacturing process (Process B), again when the patient was in a non-bleeding situation. 
The dose of the study drug for this repeat PK assessment was the same as used during the first 
evaluation. A total of 14 male patients (mean age 32 years, range 13-54 years) were included in the 
PK portion of this study, 7 patients each at 75 μg/kg and 225 μg/kg. Only two patients (both at 75 
μg/kg) were <18 years of age. Of the 7 patients who received Process A in the 75 μg/kg group, 6 
received Process B during repeat PK assessment. Of the 7 patients who received Process A in the 225 
μg/kg group, 5 received Process B during repeat PK assessment. Sequential blood samples were 
collected for PK analysis. PK data were analysed using non-compartmental methods and population PK 
modelling.  
Study LFB-FVIIa-007-14 (PerSept 2) was a Phase 3, multicentre, prospective, open-label, 
randomised, crossover study in patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX. A total 
of 23 paediatric patients (n=10 for < 6 years old and n=13 for ≥6 years to <12 years old with overall 
mean age 5.59 years and range 1-11 years) were included in the PK portion of this study, 10 patients 
at 75 μg/kg and 13 patients at 225 μg/kg. Samples were taken pre-dose in all patients. To reduce the 
number of blood draws, subsequent sparse sampling was done in approximately half of the patients 
(sampling schedule 1) at 10±2 minutes and 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes); the other half (sampling 
schedule 2) was done at 30±5 minutes and 2 and 8 hours (±10 minutes) relative to the start of 
infusion of study drug. The Cevenfacta data from the PerSept2 study were first analysed using a 
population PK approach and PK NCA parameters were derived as secondary parameters to the 
population PK modelling.

LFB-FVIIA-009-19  was  a  Phase  I,  open-label,  randomised,  parallel,  single-dose  PK  study  of 
Coagulation  Factor  VIIa  (Recombinant),  Cevenfacta,  in  subjects  with  haemophilia  A,  with  or  without 
inhibitors to FVIII. PK and safety of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 75 or 225 μg/kg were evaluated in 
28  male  subjects  aged  18  to  75  years,  inclusive,  with  confirmed  diagnosis  of haemophilia  A  (with  or 
without  inhibitors  to  FVIII)  and  who  were  not  experiencing  an  active  bleeding  episode.  This  study 
consisted of a screening visit (Day -14 to Day -1), a single-day dosing period (Day 1), and a follow-up 
telephone  call  (Day  4  ±1  day).  Total  study  participation  lasted  up  to  19  days.  Eligible  subjects  were 
randomised  (1:1)  to  receive  1  of  the  following  single  IV  dose  of  Cevenfacta:  75  or  225  μg/kg. 
Randompaediatric  was  stratified  by  FVIII  inhibitor  status  (with  [≥5  BU]  or  without  [<5  BU])  with  a 
minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 subjects with inhibitors to FVIII enrolled in each treatment group. 
Cevenfacta was administered as an IV bolus injection within 2 minutes. The infusion start time and stop 
time were recorded. Blood samples for PK assessments were collected before IMP administration and at 
5, 15, and 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after the end of the infusion. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the single-dose PK of Cevenfacta at 75 and 225 μg/kg in subjects 
with haemophilia A, with and without inhibitors to FVIII. The secondary objective was to characterise 
safety data collected before and after administration of a single dose of Cevenfacta. FVIIa concentrations 
were determined using a validated activity assay. Non-compartmental and compartmental PK analyses 
were performed. For this study, the PK parameters of primary interest were Cmax and AUC0-inf. 
Bioanalytical Methods for PK 
The clotting assay for the determination of FVIIa levels used in Studies GTC-FVIIa-005-11, RB-FVIIa- 
006-13, and LFB-FVIIa-007-14 (PK assay) is described below. A commercial kit for the assessment of 
plasma FVIIa concentrations was used which was slightly modified to be able to measure high 
concentrations of FVIIa in clinical samples. This assay, from which PK profiles were derived, was 
handled by Good Biomarker Sciences (GBS), a central laboratory in Leiden, Holland (GBS 2013-30 and 
20160321). 
A number of further assays was used to study pharmacodynamics parameters of Cevenfacta mainly 
assessed in the Phase 1b trial GTC-FVIIa-005-11. Commercial assays were used in the Study GTC-
FVIIa-005-11 and were qualified or validated for use in the clinical trial.  
Thrombin generation was assessed as measured by a calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT), a 
thrombin generation assay (TGA), which was qualified for the study. Thromboelastography, assessing 
clot formation and degradation was done using rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM). Other 
coagulation parameters assessed in Phase 1b included: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),

prothrombin time (PT) both as a regular assay and modified, prothrombin fragments 1+2 (PF1+2), D-
dimer and thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT). All assays (PK and PD assays) have been 
validated/qualified and performed by Good Biomarker Sciences (GBS) in Leiden, Netherlands. 
Descriptions of the methods that were employed in Study GTC-FVIIa-005-11 are provided below. 
PK Assay - FVIIa Activity (Clotting Assay) 
PK of Cevenfacta is assessed by measuring FVIIa activity in plasma samples. The applicant for this 
purpose has adapted and validated the commercially available Statclot VIIa clotting assay to quantify 
active rhFVIIa in human plasma samples. In brief, in presence of phospholipids and calcium ions, the 
tested plasma is coagulated by addition of a mutated rTF, which possesses a cofactor function specific 
for the factor Vlla -assay principle and does not allow activation of the factor VII into factor VIIa; 
consequently the factor VII present in the tested plasma does not interfere in the assay. In this system 
the observed clotting time bears an inverse relationship with the factor VIIa level originally present in 
the test plasma sample. The assay was optimised during clinical development, and different assay 
protocols were applied.  
The (endogenous) FVIIa inhibitor TFPI interfered in the original assay format, and the dynamic range 
of the assay was not suitable for measuring high FVIIa levels, which were reached after exogenous 
administration of Cevenfacta. Thus the assay matrix was replaced by TFPI and VIIa free reagent 
Hemoclot VII, which serves as homogenous matrix in the adapted assay. To accommodate the 
occurrence of high plasma factor VIIa levels in samples following administration of recombinant factor 
VIIa, the calibration line was extended over a 1000-fold range, but the calibration curve needed to be 
fitted with two functions: One for the concentration range from 0.3 to 10, and a second one for the 
range of 10 to 300 ng/ml FVIIa. The clotting reagent was diluted to obtain long clotting time < 240 sec 
observed to include baseline levels earlier and the limit set at the equipment. For very high levels 
above 300 ng/ml of FVIIa, a policy of dilution of the sample in 0.1% bovine serum albumin was 
defined.  
In the initial version of the assay, and only for Phase I development the rhFVIIa was used as 
calibrator. From Phase III development on two different lots of commercially available NovoSeven were 
used as calibrators.  
The validity of the latest version of the assay for its intended application was demonstrated as 
summarised below.

Table 3: Validity of the latest assay version 
Comparability of different versions of PK assays applied throughout clinical development (pivotal 
studies PerSept 1 and PerSept 2) was not performed, and head-to-head testing of assay reactivity of 
different batches of LR96 also was not done, and cannot be performed anymore, since respective 
samples are no more available. ISR was also not performed and cannot be performed retrospectively, 
also since samples are no more available. Thus, it must be kept in mind that applied methods to 
assess PK data from studies PerSept 1 and PerSept 2 were not fully validated. 
The applicant provided further clinical PK data from a new clinical study FVIIa-009-19 based on 
activated FVII plasma concentrations, analysed using a different PK assay, based on STAclot VIIa-rTF 
reagents and measured on an automated coagulation analyser. The assay was completely validated for 
its precision, accuracy, selectivity, specificity, dilution linearity, prozone effect, carry over, and 
robustness including extended determination of frozen sample stability. Dilution linearity was 
confirmed. The performance of the method for activated Factor VII in human plasma was also found 
adequate during the bioanalysis of clinical samples, as demonstrated by the precision and accuracy for 
calibration and QC sample results, and by ISR (10% of total samples) and parallelism assessment. 
Assay validation protocols and the bioanalytical report were provided, confirming that the method was 
suitable for the intended use over a concentration range from 1.6 to 60 ng/ml in human plasma 
matrix.

Taken together, only PK data from study FVIIA-009-19 are considered valid.  
PK Data Analysis 
Data were analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling. A 
population PK model was initially built based on the data from the Phase 1b study and subsequently 
re-analysed to generate an integrated population PK model each time more data became available 
from the subsequent studies. The models were further updated including fixed allometric scaling and a 
maturation function upon request. PK data from study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 were also integrated in the 
analysis once they became available. In addition, for each study a separate popPK model was build. 
Based on the integrated popPK model, exposure-response models were developed for efficacy 
(successfully treated bleeding episodes at 12 hours with different severity) and safety parameter 
(TEAEs and ADR). During the procedure, the results of the exposure response models were also 
updated based on the requested update of the population PK model. 
For each study the NCA analysis was performed independently from the popPK analysis, except for 
study PerSept 2. Since only sparse sampling was performed in this study, the NAC analysis was 
performed post-hoc and calculated based on the population PK model. 
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
The population PK model, its requested update and the subsequent exposure-response models are 
briefly described in this report. The initial population PK model used pooled data from the Phase 1B 
study and the two Phase 3 studies PERSEPT 1 and PERSEPT 2: single dose PK data from 52 male 
patients (GTCFVIIa-005-11 n = 15, PERSEPT 1 n = 14, and PERSEPT 2 n = 23). Numbers of patients 
below 18 years of age are listed in Table 12. The updated population PK model used additional data 
from study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 (Study 009), a single-dose Cevenfacta study including 28 patients with 
haemophilia A with or without inhibitors aged between 18 to 75 years.  
Table 4: Number of patients below the age of 18 years included in the PK analysis 
For all population PK-models covariates were investigated graphically followed by a forward inclusion 
and backward elimination procedure. Different covariates were tested. A description of the 
investigation of random effects was missing. Model development was performed using standard 
procedures and commonly used methods were used for model evaluation, selection and investigation 
of the predictive performance of the models.

Initially, the final population PK model was a two-compartment model with first order elimination and a 
proportional error model. Weight effects on clearance (CL), volume of central component (Vc), 
clearance or peripheral component (Q) and volume of peripheral component (Vp) were estimated and 
included in the model, as well as age category effect on Vc, and study effect on the proportional error. 
Upon request, the model was updated by applying fixed allometric scaling exponents on volume and 
clearance and evaluated a maturation function for very young children. During this update, two distinct 
models were considered for evaluation, an updated PK model with fixed allometric scaling exponents 
and an updated PK model with fixed allometric scaling exponents and maturation function for Children 
aged <2 years.  
Fixing the exponents for the weight effect on clearance and volume of distribution to the theoretical 
values (0.75 for CL and 1 for V) did not significantly improve the population PK model compared to the 
initial PK model.  
The inclusion of a maturation function was hampered by the very limited data for very young children 
(1 patient < 1year, 5 patients <2 years). The applicant tried to estimate the hill coefficient by fixing 
the age at 50% of maturation to 12 months. With the exception of the additional parameters from the 
sigmoidal function, PK parameter estimates of the PK model with fixed allometric scaling exponents 
and maturation function were then similar to estimates of the PK model with fixed allometric scaling 
exponents only.

Equivalence of manufacturing process A to manufacturing process B 
A manufacturing change of the drug product was introduced during clinical development and was first 
tested within PerSept1. For pharmacokinetic evaluation of both products, patients were first exposed to 
the drug from manufacturing process A and 3-6 months later, the same patients received the same 
drug concentration of manufacturing process B. Plasma samples were taken at the same time points 
after infusion for each of the two occasions. Within study Persept1 in total 11 patients were exposed to 
process B for PK sampling (n=14 for process A with n=7 for 75µg/kg and 225µg/kg; n=11 for process 
B with n=6 for 75µg/kg and n=5 for 225µg/kg).

Children 
Study LFB-FVIIa-007-14 (PerSept 2) included a total of 23 paediatric patients in the PK portion of this 
study, 10 patients at 75 μg/kg and 13 patients at 225 μg/kg. Data on PK parameters derived from 
post-hoc NCA are presented above. 
Following the integrated popPK model the age category was found to be a significant covariate for 
volume of distribution (Vc in patients < 2 years, ≥ 2 to < 6 years, and ≥ 6 to <12 years was 82%, 
20%, and 5% lower than Vc in patients ≥ 12 years) and clearance (CL). The body weight normalised 
CL determined by age category showed lower values in the paediatric population as compared to adults 
and adolescents with a general trend of decreased normalised CL with increased body weight among 
the paediatric groups. Compared with the adults and adolescents, body weight normalised CL of 
Cevenfacta Process B with the 225 μg/kg dose was higher by 137.5% in patients aged 2 to <6 years 
and by 62.5% in patients aged ≥6 to <12 years. For the 75 μg/kg dose, it was higher by 46.7% in 
patients aged 2 to <6 years and lower by 6.67% in patients ≥6 to <12 years; Table 10).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No specific drug-drug interactions studies were conducted with Cevenfacta. However, various drug-
drug interactions have been observed with medicinal products from the same therapeutic class; these

interactions were associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events due to an interaction 
between activated prothrombin complex concentrates and eptacog alpha (NovoSeven). In the clinical 
studies with Cevenfacta, no thromboembolic events have been observed. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
PK/PD model: Report CHDR1201 / GTC-FVIIa-005-11 
The applicant performed a pharmacometric analysis characterising the relationship between Factor VIIa 
(Process A) and the four PD variables Thrombin Generation Assay with platelets (AUC of peak, 
TGTp_AUC), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thromboelastography (ROTEM) and 
Prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2) after administration of rhFVIIa. The PK-PD models best describing 
the data for TGTp and ROTEM were Hill equations (sigmoid maximal effect model), where the 
TGTp_AUC, or ROTEM_peak increases with increasing Factor VIIa concentration (FVIIa C). For aPPT 
and F1+2, a maximum effect model was most suitable, where the aPTT decreases or F1+2 increases 
with increasing Factor VIIa concentration. For F1+2 an effect compartment was required to account for 
a delay in effect. 
All taken together the relationship for the above-mentioned PD markers were found to follow a 
saturable function of concentration: EC50 values were 87 to 1280 ng/ml. 80% of the maximum effect 
was achieved at concentrations between 1000-2000 ng/mL Cevenfacta. The relationship between PD 
markers and efficacy has not been documented. 
Exposure-response analysis for efficacy 
The E-R analysis for efficacy was based on data from phase 3 studies PERSEPT 1 and PERSEPT 2. 
Exposure parameters for activated eptacog beta were combined with the primary efficacy endpoint: 
Successful treatment of a bleeding episode at 12 h after first administration of the study drug. Two 
variables were created for the efficacy endpoint: proportion of successfully treated bleeding episodes at 
12 h regardless of severity, and proportion of successfully treated mild/moderate bleeding episodes at 
12 h. All bleeding events and their respective outcome were included in the analysis. Exposure 
parameters (AUC, Cmax, and Cmin) were simulated using the population PK model on the day of each 
event and from the time of the dose to 12 h post-dose. Upon request the E-R analysis was rerun using 
the updated PK models. Results remained generally similar, but it was not justified how the adequacy 
and predictive performance of the provided models could be considered as satisfactory. 
Exposure-response analysis for safety 
In the original exposure-safety response analysis, only treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
were analysed as their occurrence is relatively frequent in all studies (Table 11). Treatment- related 
TEAEs were not analysed as they were sparsely observed (e.g., no TRTEAEs were observed in PerSept 
2).

Table 11. Overall Summary of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events by Study 
The update of the exposure-response (ER) analysis for TEAEs involved the inclusion of TEAEs reported 
in Study 009 with the pooled TEAE data from studies Phase 1b, PerSept 1 and PerSept 2. The original 
ER model for TEAEs fitted a logistic regression model relating the log-odds of a TEAE with Cevenfacta 
AUC0-24 at the day of the TEAE. Table 12 below shows the parameter estimates derived with the old 
pool of data and the updated data pool with the inclusion of Study 009. Results for the updated model 
did not change the relationship between the log-odds of a TEAE with Cevenfacta AUC. The significant 
intercept in the model suggested that the probability of experiencing TEAEs was higher than zero even 
in the absence of Cevenfacta. 
Table 12. Parameters Estimates of the Exposure-Response Analysis ER1 based on data from 
PK Model with Fixed Allometric Scaling Exponents 
When looking at TEAEs by age group presented in Table 13, one can observe that frequency of TEAEs 
was comparable between age groups with a slight trend toward more patients reporting TEAEs in the 
age group 6 to less than 12 years mainly due to more infections and infestations in this age group. In 
addition, compared to adults, lower incidence of TEAEs per infusion were observed in all paediatric age 
groups.

2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The active ingredient in Cevenfacta is a recombinant analogue of human FVIIa, a vitamin K-dependent 
coagulation factor with a molecular mass of 50,000 Daltons. The applicant depicts three distinct 
pathways in which FVIIa leads to blood coagulation in haemophilia patients. In haemophilia A or B 
patients, FVIIa activates coagulation through the natural “TF-dependent” mechanism but the 
therapeutic doses required to reach haemostasis by using FVIIa are much more elevated than the 
normal FVIIa circulating concentration. The applicant explains that in the presence of supra-
physiological doses of FVIIa, two additional coagulation pathways are induced. A second coagulation 
pathway “TF-independent” leads, similarly to the “TF-dependent” mode of action, to the generation of 
FXa at the surface of activated platelets, without the need of TF to anchor FVIIa at the cell surface and 
modify its structure. In addition, the use of high-FVIIa doses alleviates the natural and constant 
inhibition of FVIIa by the FVII zymogen. In a third pathway, FVIIa competes with activated protein C 
(aPC) by binding to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). Thus, it is thought that FVIIa down 
modulates the anticoagulation by limiting the cleavage of Factor Va (the FXa co-factor) by the aPC. The 
applicant explains that the combination of these three pathways allows FVIIa to bypass the need of 
FVIIIa or FIXa restoring haemostasis even in the presence of inhibitors. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamics parameters of Cevenfacta were mainly assessed in the Phase 1b trial GTC-
FVIIa-005-11. Study GTC-FVIIa-005-11 was a dose escalation study to assess the safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Cevenfacta across three dose levels (25, 75, 
and 225 μg/kg) in a total of 15 adult male patients (mean age 33 years, range 20-61 years) with 
congenital haemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. 
A set of well-established PD assays have been used in order to characterise the pharmacodynamics 
properties of Cevenfacta. The PD assays/parameters included Thrombin Generation Test, Prothrombin 
time (PT), Thrombin Generation Test with added platelets (TGTp), Rotational thromboelastometry 
(ROTEM-FIBTEM), Prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2), D-dimers and Thrombin antithrombin complex 
(TAT). 
In addition, in the Phase 1b trial, the relationship between plasma Cevenfacta concentration and key 
PD parameters including AUC of the peak of the thrombin generation assay with platelets (TGTp_AUC), 
aPTT, maximum clot firmness (MCF) and prothrombin fragments 1+2 was explored. The relationship 
between PD markers and predicted plasma concentration were estimated through PK/PD modelling 
using the population PK model initially built. This model was subsequently used to simulate the 
Cevenfacta PD effects for several dosing scenarios. 
Furthermore, an in vitro study (Study 14ENC006) was conducted using plasma from haemophilia A and 
B patients with or without inhibitors (LFB Biotechnologies, Les Ulis, France). The study investigated the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 58/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in vitro effects of Cevenfacta Process A, Cevenfacta Process B and NovoSeven on the thrombin 
generation time (TGT), the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated thromboplastin time (aPTT).  
Primary Pharmacology 
The thrombin generation test with the added platelets showed that increasing levels of Cevenfacta lead 
to increasing formation of thrombin. In the prothrombin time assay, the prothrombin times were 
shortened to a similar extent with all three dose levels. Similar results were observed if this test was 
performed with diluted tissue factor. In the activated partial thromboplastin time assay, there was a 
dose dependent reduction in aPTT, with the 225µg/kg dose shortening the aPTT to approximately 35 
seconds 5 min post infusion. In the rotational thromboelastometry, it was shown that there was a dose 
dependent effect on the clot firmness. Further, a dose dependent effect could also be observed in the 
formation of prothrombin fragments 1+2. There were no differences observed in the D-dimer 
formation. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
No dedicated studies/analyses were performed on the effects of Cevenfacta not related to its desired 
therapeutic target. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has submitted four studies that included the assessment of pharmacokinetics. A Phase1b 
study (Study GTC-FVIIa-005-11) was conducted with the product manufactured with a prior 
manufacturing process A in 15 male patients (age range: 20-61 years) applying three doses (25µg/kg, 
75µg/kg and 225µg/kg), all patients were without inhibitors. A new manufacturing process was 
introduced (process B) during the first phase 3 study with PK component (Study RB-FVIIa-006-13, 
PerSept1). The PerSept1 study was conducted in 14 adolescent and adult, male patients (age range: 
13-54 years), all with inhibitors. The assessment of PK parameters was first performed for the product 
manufactured with the old process A and repeated after 3-6 months for the new manufacturing 
process B in the same patients with the same dose as for the previous product A (repeated exposure 
for n=6 for 75µg/kg and n=5 for 225µg/kg). A third study (Study LFB-FVIIa-007-14, PerSept2) with 
PK component was conducted in male paediatric patients (age range 1-11 years) with inhibitors 
utilizing process B in two dose ranges (75µg/kg and 225µg/kg). A sparse sampling schedule was 
followed for this study in order to reduce the burden on paediatric patients. A further Phase 1 study on 
28 adult subjects (18 to 75 years) with haemophilia A, with or without inhibitors to FVIII, was 
submitted during the assessment process (n=14 per dose of 75µg/kg and 225µg/kg). This study was 
primarily designed to evaluate the PK profile utilising manufacturing process B. Throughout the 
assessment of PK data in all studies all patients were in a non-bleeding state. In general, variability 
within and across studies was high. Substantial intra-subject variability was observed for the two 
occasions utilising process A and process B in study PerSept1 and substantial variability was observed 
for paediatric patients in study PerSept2, compared to adults in PerSept1. The source of variation is 
unclear, but low patient numbers might contribute. 
Data were analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling. The 
population PK analysis was initially performed with the data from the Phase 1b study and subsequently 
re-analysed when more data became available from the subsequent studies. Upon request the model  
was again updated including fixed allometric scaling and a maturation function. Additional PK data from 
study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 became available and were also integrated in the analysis. For each study, the 
NCA analysis was performed independently from the popPK analysis, except for study PerSept2. Since 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 59/137 
 
 
 
only sparse sampling was performed in this study, the NCA analysis was performed post-hoc and 
calculated based on the population PK model. The initial population-PK model (Certara-LFBP-PMX-
Cevenfacta-1617) pooled all available single dose PK data from 52 male patients (Phase 1B n = 15, 
PERSEPT 1 n = 14, and PERSEPT-2 [paediatric population] n = 23). The updated model included 
additional data from 28 male patients (study LFB-FVIIA-009-19). The methods applied for 
pharmacokinetic data analysis appear appropriate and principally acceptable. However, several 
uncertainties arose with respect to the applied popPK model (including the subsequent exposure-
response evaluation on efficacy and safety) limiting the applicability of the respective models. While 
most limitations of the models are related to the small sample size (overparameterpaediatric, wide CIs 
preventing significant results), other aspects like strong confounding between age and manufacturing 
process have been identified. The requested modifications together with the new data improved the 
initial model only slightly. Therefore, the presented models are currently not regarded as robust and 
conclusions based on the respective models have to be interpreted with care. Further, due to the 
confounding of manufacturing process and the paediatric population, it can currently not be 
determined whether the differences observed for the paediatric population are in relation to the 
manufacturing process or biological differences compared to the adult population. It is further 
recognised that the post-hoc NCA, as applied in study PerSept2 due to sparse data sampling, depends 
highly on the reliability and robustness of the prior applied model. Given the very limited number of 
patients and the large age range of the target population (from birth to 75 years of age (or older)), a 
reliable PK model is of high importance to gain as precise information as possible.  
Given the identified limitations of the models and especially the very limited data in very young 
children (no data are available for neonates), currently the model is not expected to yield reliable 
information. Upon request PK simulations for the different dosing scenarios proposed in the SmPC were 
presented using the updated model for the different age groups: birth to < 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 
to < 12 years, 12 to < 18 years, and from 18 years onwards. Results indicate that infants below 2 
years of age are expected to have Cmax values much higher than those achieved in older children or 
adults. Therefore, the adequacy of these doses for infants is doubted from the PK perspective. As a 
consequence of uncertain exposure and dosing recommendations, it was concluded that the paediatric 
indication (<12 years) will not be further pursued. 
The bioavailability of Cevenfacta is considered to be 100% due to administration via intravenous bolus 
injection and due to its proposed similarity to the human endogenous FVIIa no further metabolic route 
besides proteolytic degradation is to be expected.  
Within study PerSept1 striking differences were seen for mean PK parameters after receiving the 
higher dose and evaluation by NCA (Cmax: 1392 ng/mL for A vs. 2441 ng/mL for B, AUC0-inf: 2042 
ng*h/mL for A vs. 2842 ng*h/mL for B, CL: 8.5 L/h for A vs. 5.8L/h for B, Vd: 16 L for A and 12 L for 
B; all considering the arithmetic mean). The impression of different PK profiles between both 
manufacturing processes is supported by the observed intra-subject variability in descriptive individual 
plasma concentrations as well as the results of the NCA on individual data. In study PerSept1 all 
patients treated with 225µg/kg had higher plasma concentrations at the first blood draw (10 minutes 
after study drug administration) when treated with manufacturing process B compared to values from 
process A, resulting in higher NCA values on individual level and higher point estimates on NCA PK 
parameters on population level. Individual plasma concentrations and individual PK parameters after 
NCA for patients treated with 75µg/kg also suggest a high intra-subject variability between process A 
and B. Whereas patients treated with the higher dose consistently had a higher exposure (Cmax and 
AUC) for process B compared to process A, some patients treated with the lower dose also had 
substantially reduced exposure from process B. It appears that this intra-individual variability resulted 
in comparable point estimates from NCA for the population treated with 75µg/kg in study PerSept1. 
Importantly, study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 provides further evidence on the to-be-marketed product from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 60/137 
 
 
 
process B on significantly more subjects compared to PerSept1 (n=28 in study LFB-FVIIA-009-19  vs. 
n=11 in study PerSept1). Data on Cmax and AUC for manufacturing process B confirm the previously 
described increased exposure for process B in comparison to process A, as assessed in study PerSept1. 
However, results for process B in study PerSept1 were also lower compared to the results in study LFB-
FVIIA-009-19 with the same manufacturing process. In fact, results following NCA from study LFB-
FVIIA-009-19 deviate substantially from PerSept1 after exposure to manufacturing process B with 
respect to key PK parameters (i.e. Cmax, AUC0-in, AUC0-last, volume of distribution and half-life t½). 
Clearance appears to be more comparable across both studies. It is recognised that variability is 
enormous throughout measures in both studies, as to be expected for the rather low number of tested 
subjects. Validity of PK assays used for studies PerSept1 and PerSept2 are questioned and as a 
consequence provided information in the SmPC regarding PK on adult subjects are restricted to data 
generated from NCA in study LFB-FVIIA-009-19. Neither of the updated models can conclude PK 
comparability of the two manufacturing processes A and B. It is noted that all PK measures were 
assessed in a non-bleeding state and a higher overall exposure of process B might have a positive 
effect on efficacy during bleeding state (but potentially also a detrimental effect on safety). It is further 
noted that comparability of process A and B appears to be more conclusive based on the newly 
provided Quality data. However, considering all provided evidence, data from study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 
appear to be the most reliable information on PK. In conclusion, the PK profile for the to-be-marketed 
manufacturing process B appears to be sufficiently characterised with additional data from study LFB-
FVIIA-009-19. Results from manufacturing process A are still considered to be supportive information 
regarding PK, despite the uncertain comparability between both manufacturing processes on PK level.  
Reasons for the observed deviation in geometric mean values across studies PerSept1 and LFB-FVIIA-
009-19 are currently not entirely clear. Upon request, the applicant elaborated on weight 
(underweight/normal/overweight/obese) and race (black/non-black) subgroups as potential factors for 
the observed substantial discrepancy for the PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-in, AUC0-last, volume of 
distribution and half-life t½ across studies after exposure to the same manufacturing process. Within 
study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 higher body weight is related to higher exposure for either of the available 
doses (75µg/kg and 225µg/kg). Similarly, black subjects appear to show higher drug exposure upon 
administration of the lower dose (75µg/kg), but not (or rather a bit lower exposure) after the higher 
dose (225µg/kg). However, small sample size in the subgroups limits robust conclusions within and 
across studies. It is further recognised that subject 12-<18 years were included only in study PerSept1 
(2 subjects, both dosed with 75µg/kg). Presented data in the SmPC are to be restricted to NCA results 
from study LFB-FVIIA-009-19, but NCA data from study PerSept1 could still be considered as 
supportive information. 
Within study PerSept1 dose-proportionality could not be demonstrated for the manufacturing process B 
(i.e. a 3- fold increase in dose resulted in a 5-fold increase in exposure), but was more evident for 
process A following NCA results. However, dose-proportionality appears conclusive within study LFB-
FVIIA-009-19, which included more than double the number of participants tested form process B 
(ratio between 75µg/kg and 225µg/kg as summarised for NCA of PK parameters in study LFB-FVIIA-
009-19: 3.4 for Cmax, 3.5 for AUC0-inf and 3.5 for AUC0-last).  In summary, the totality of data on 
dose-proportionality leave some uncertainty with respect to manufacturing process B, which might be 
caused by high data variability, low patient numbers, sparse sampling and age-related differences. 
Approximate dose proportionality could be assumed for Cevenfacta with respect to the newly 
generated data in study LFB-FVIIA-009-19 (a minor over-proportional increase in exposure should be 
considered for the higher dose). Regarding dose proportionality in steady-state no reliable information 
are available, due to questioned performance of submitted models.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 61/137 
 
 
 
The pharmacodynamics activities of Cevenfacta were mainly evaluated in the Phase 1b trial GTC-FVIIa-
005-11. The PD parameters were analysed across three different dose levels. The used PD parameters 
are well-established markers to describe the procoagulant activity of coagulation products. In light of 
the observed differences in PK parameters between Process A and B product in the PerSept 1 study 
and the fact that only Process A product was used in the Phase 1b study GTC-FVIIa-005-11, the 
applicant was asked to justify the relevance of the generated PD results for the to be commercialised 
product derived from Process B. The applicant justified the lack of PD data with Process B product on 
PK and efficacy data generated with this product. In summary, it is not considered optimal that PD 
data were only generated with Process A product and not with the to be commercialised Process B 
product. However, a further request regarding PD data would not be regarded as fruitful as direct PD 
bridging is impossible. 
In addition to the in vivo analyses of PD effects in the Phase 1b study, an in vitro study (Study 
14ENC006) was conducted using plasma from haemophilia A and B patients with or without inhibitors 
(LFB Biotechnologies, Les Ulis, France). The study investigated the in vitro effects of Cevenfacta 
Process A, Cevenfacta Process B and NovoSeven on the thrombin generation time (TGT), the 
prothrombin time (PT) and the activated thromboplastin time (aPTT). 
In addition to the well-described mechanism in which FVIIa initiates the coagulation via the interaction 
with tissue factor at the cell surface, thereby activating Factor X to Factor Xa and initiating the 
common pathway of coagulation, the applicant describes two additional coagulation pathways that 
might be induced by supra-physiological doses of factor VIIa. One is the “TF-independent” pathway, 
which is similar to the “TF dependent” pathway without the need of TF to anchor FVIIa to the cell 
surface. In the other one, FVIIa competes with activated protein C by binding to the endothelial protein 
C receptor. Protein C, in a complex with Protein S, normally neutralises Factor Va, thereby impeding 
coagulation. Thus, supra-physiological doses of factor VIIa might down modulate anticoagulation by 
limiting the cleavage of factor Va by the aPC. After request, the mechanism of action was 
substantiated by the applicant by literature references. 
For the analysis of the primary pharmacology, the applicant used a set of well-established assays to 
describe the PD activities of Cevenfacta. The thrombin generation test with the added platelets showed 
that increasing levels of Cevenfacta lead to increasing formation of thrombin. In the prothrombin time 
assay, the prothrombin times were shortened to a similar extent with all three dose levels. Similar 
results were observed if this test was performed with diluted tissue factor. In the activated partial 
thromboplastin time assay, there was a dose dependent reduction in aPTT, with the 225µg/kg dose 
shortening the aPTT to approximately 35 seconds 5 min post infusion. However, the results of this 
assay have to be interpreted carefully, as there is a very high inter-individual variability. In the 
rotational thromboelastometry, it was shown that there was a dose dependent effect on the clot 
firmness. However, there was also a high inter-individual variability in this assay. Further, a dose 
dependent effect could also be observed in the formation of prothrombin fragments 1+2, but again 
with a high inter-individual variability. There were no differences observed in the D-dimer formation. In 
conclusion, although some of the PD marker results have to be interpreted carefully due to high inter-
individual variability, there seems to be a dose dependent effect of Cevenfacta on some of the PD 
markers. In the protocol of the Phase 1b study GTC-FVIIa-005-11, it was stated that the thrombin 
generation test will be performed with low and high tissue factor concentrations in order to try to 
mimic the in vivo physiological state. However, only the results with the addition of 0.5 pM tissue 
factor were presented in the CSR. It was further stated that the thrombin generation test (performed 
with platelet-poor plasma and initiated by addition of 0.5pM tissue factor) cannot be considered valid 
as there was an unfavourable signal noise ratio that hinders a proper interpretation of the results. 
According to the applicant, this might be due to the collection of blood with an indwelling catheter that 
could have led to thrombin generation or the activation of precursors. The applicant explains that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 62/137 
 
 
 
results of the thrombin generation test with added platelets is more representative for the mode of 
action of rhFVIIa. The applicant was asked to comment on the absence of the thrombin generation test 
in the presence of high tissue factor concentration, as it might have also been more representative to 
the mechanism of action of Cevenfacta than the experiment with the low tissue factor. The applicant 
explained the absence of the thrombin generation test in the presence of high tissue factor 
concentration with the higher sensitivity of this assay when performed with low concentration of tissue 
factor. Although it is not considered optimal that pre-defined experiments in the protocol were not 
performed, it is not considered of crucial importance to have these experiments. 
No dedicated studies/analyses were performed on the effects of Cevenfacta not related to its desired 
therapeutic target. As there does not seem to be an additional pharmacological effect of Cevenfacta 
apart from coagulation, this is regarded acceptable. 
The applicant did not perform specific drug-drug interaction studies. However, for medicinal products 
from the same therapeutic class, various drug-drug interactions have been observed, leading to an 
increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although no thromboembolic events have been observed in 
the clinical studies conducted with Cevenfacta, the risk of thrombotic events when used simultaneously 
with activated or non-activated prothrombin complex concentrate or other haemostatic agents has 
been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Regarding the other haemostatic agents mentioned in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC, there is a reference made to section 4.5 of the SmPC. However, apart from 
activated prothrombin complex concentrates, there were no further haemostatic agents listed in 
section 4.5. The applicant was asked to adapt this section to reflect other haemostatic agents with 
which a PD interaction seems likely, e.g. factor XIII. The applicant adapted section 4.5 of the SmPC 
according to the recommendations. Furthermore, drug-drug interactions will be monitored in post-
marketing studies (please see RMP section). 
The genetic differences in PD response were not assessed in the clinical studies. 
PKPD models (Report CHDR1201 / GTC-FVIIa-005-11) for Thrombin Generation Assay with platelets 
(AUC of peak, TGTp_AUC), Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), Thromboelastography 
(ROTEM), and Prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2) were developed using the final population PK model 
for 15 adult male patients treated in the Phase 1b study. However, the targeted values for these PD 
parameters TGTp_AUC, aPTT, thromboelastography and prothrombin fragments 1+2 and their 
respective targeted exposure was not clear and was asked to be specified. Furthermore, the applicant 
was asked to provide a discussion whether these investigated PD effects are intended to be used as 
reliable PD marker and thus to predict optimal dosing strategies with PKPD modelling. The applicant 
did not reply to the question regarding the targeted values of the PD markers which were assessed in 
the PKPD modelling and simulation report CHDR1201 / GTC-FVIIa-005-11. It was stated that the 
relationship between PD markers and efficacy has not been documented. Thus it is assumed that 
TGTp_AUC, aPTT, thromboelastography, and prothrombin fragments 1+2 are no reliable PD markers. 
For the three markers AUC of the peak of TGT with platelets, aPTT and MCF (ROTEM-FIBTEM), there 
seems to be a saturated relationship between plasma concentrations and coagulation marker. The 
applicant provided a further plot describing the PK/PD relationship for the prothrombin fragments 1+2 
(submitted in Appendix 3 of the CHDR1201 PK/PD report). The PK/PD response for this marker seems 
to be different from the three PD markers mentioned above. There does not seem to be a saturated 
relationship and the maximum effect on this PD marker is not reached even with the highest dose of 
225 µg/kg. The applicant was asked to provide an explanation for the PK/PD relationship of the PD 
marker prothrombin fragments 1+2, being divergent from the PK/PD relationship of the other PD 
markers provided. The applicant has substantiated this divergence by the fact that the three 
techniques measuring the in vitro potency of eptacog beta are saturable due to the limited amount of 
components and time used in the in vitro assays. In contrast, prothrombin fragments 1+2 was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 63/137 
 
 
 
measured in vivo. Only a minor part of the coagulation system is engaged in vivo and therefore, 
saturation cannot be achieved. The explanation provided by the applicant can be followed. However, as 
it is also stated in section 5.1 of the SmPC, the PD markers do not correlate with or predict the 
haemostatic effectiveness of this medicinal product.  
In addition to the PK/PD model the applicant performed exposure-response analyses to evaluate the 
relationship between exposure and efficacy and safety parameters. Data from phase 3 studies 
PERSEPT 1 and PERSEPT 2 were used for efficacy analysis, while data from all studies were used to 
investigate the relationship between exposure and safety. Two efficacy parameters were used for the 
analysis: The proportion of successfully treated bleeding episodes at 12 h regardless of severity and of 
mild/moderate bleeding episodes at 12 h. For the safety analysis TEAEs were used. Overall, the validity 
of the conclusions drawn from these E-R analyses are doubted as the exposure parameters (AUC and 
Cmax) were derived with the updated population-PK model which is not considered reliable. 
Furthermore, these models are not considered reliable on their own regardless of the exposure 
parameter as several deficiencies were identified, including e.g. for the efficacy models, poor 
estimation of key parameters, high IIV, deviation of the prediction vs. the observation resulting in 
over-prediction. The applicant provided the requested E-R analysis by age groups. Overall, the 
probability of response does not seem to be clearly associated with increasing exposure (i.e. Cmax). 
While for adults a slight relationship between increasing exposure and probability of response might be 
interpreted, for infants below 2 years of age increasing Cmax was not necessarily associated with 
increasing probability of response. However, these results are not considered reliable based on the 
issues concerning the validity of the used data and the reliability of the population-PK model discussed 
above. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, pharmacokinetics of Process B were characterised reliably in the last study (LFB-FVIIA-009-
19). Pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses based on data collected in earlier studies are 
not considered reliable since the respective PK data cannot be regarded as valid.  
Although it is not considered optimal that PD data were only generated with Process A product and not 
with the to be commercialised Process B product, the statements made in section 5.1 of the SmPC 
regarding PD are acceptable. Section 5.1 of the SmPC also state that the laboratory assessments of 
coagulation do not necessarily correlate with or predict the haemostatic effectiveness of this medicinal 
product. 
2.5.6.  Clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data are available from 3 interventional clinical studies with Cevenfacta (PerSept 1 and 
PerSept 2: treatment of bleeding episodes; PerSept 3: prevention of bleeding in surgical or invasive 
procedures). See the tabular overview at the beginning of section 2.5.1. 
OPC (Objective Performance Criterion) 
Since controlled studies were not feasible, the proportion of success for the pivotal studies PerSept 1 
and PerSept 2 was compared to a pre specified objective performance criterion (OPC) = 0.55. This OPC 
was determined by reviewing the literature on the reported success of treatment with bypassing 
agents mainly in adult patients (Table 9). 
However, due to the use of a different endpoint in the PerSept 1 and PerSept 2 studies compared with 
several other different endpoints described in published literature, including studies used to support 
the initial registration of NovoSeven, an estimate of what the OPC should be was difficult. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 64/137 
 
 
 
Several publications provided a wide range of bleeding success (25% to 93%) at different timepoints 
depending on the type of efficacy assessment used. An OPC of 55% was chosen, taking into account 
the stringent criteria for success (including elements to more objectively judge treatment success) in 
the PerSept 1 and PerSept 2 studies and the reported success rate for a study used to support 
registration of NovoSeven in the US and Europe. This OPC defined mainly in adult patients was also 
retained for the paediatric PerSept 2 study. 
In the scientific advice procedure concluded in May 2014, the following comments were given with 
regard to the OPC: “CHMP supports the definition of, and the testing against an 'objective performance 
criterion' (OPC) when evaluating treatment success of the two considered regimens, although it is not 
considered a requirement for a successful MA. It is felt that - in the context of the current treatment 
options in this rare condition - testing against the defined OPC (0.55) should not be interpreted as a 
rigid trial's 'success criterion'. Neither will statistical significant superiority over the OPC lead to a 
registration of a regimen based on an automatism only, nor should a minor miss of the defined efficacy 
criterion obviate a filing. At MAA, the totality of the data available will be evaluated regarding the 
benefit risk ratio of each investigated dosing regimen. In this context, it will be important to obtain 
estimates of treatment success rates under the two considered regimens as precise as possible. 
Accounting for multiplicity is generally endorsed. Reported/quoted studies of a similar design provide 
efficacy percentages in the 70-90% range, and not often lower than 60%. When defining the OPC, it 
seems to be important to account for the information in how far the data from the literature refer to 
mild/moderate bleeding episodes. However, it is acknowledged that a three point rating scale is used 
in several trials, which could skew results into the more effective range.” 
These comments are taken into account when interpreting the provided study outcomes for both 
pivotal trials PerSept 1 and PerSept 2. 
In addition, it is acknowledged that the identified published data describe mainly treated bleeding 
events in adults, and no study focussing on a paediatric population is available in order to provide at 
least a suitable historical control for the younger subjects.

Methods 
This was a global, multicentre, Phase 3, prospective, open-label, randomised, crossover study. 
•  Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
The main inclusion criteria were: male patients with congenital haemophilia A or B with inhibitors 
(Bethesda Unit [BU] ≥5) or <5 BU with a known high anamnestic response or <5 BU and refractory to 
increased dosing of either FVIII or FIX; were ≥12 years of age (up to and including 75 years of age); 
and who had at least 3 bleeding episodes of any severity in the past 6 months. 
Assessment report

Exclusion criteria 
The main exclusion criteria were: any other coagulation disorder other than haemophilia A or B, being 
immunosuppressed (no systemic immunosuppressive medication allowed, CD4 counts should be 
>200/µl), platelet count <100,000 ml, known allergy or hypersensitivity to rabbits, clinically relevant 
hepatic and/or renal impairment, history of thrombotic events. 
Patients on ITI therapy were allowed to be treated in the study as well, as long as they fulfilled the 
criteria for inhibitors as described above and had regular bleeding episodes. 
•  Treatments 
Patients were randomised to start treatment with one of the two following study drug regimens: 
• 75 μg/kg Cevenfacta treatment regimen 
• 225 μg/kg Cevenfacta treatment regimen 
The patients crossed over to the alternate treatment regimen every 12 weeks until the end of the 
study. 
During Phase A, depending on their randomisation, all patients received a single IV administration of 
either 75 μg/kg or 225 μg/kg of Cevenfacta as a bolus injection within 2 minutes for an initial 
assessment of safety. During treatment Phase B (24 hours after study drug administration in Phase A), 
patients started with the treatment regimen assigned at randomisation consisting of 3-month periods 
(12 weeks).

The use of other sources of FVII(a), such as aPCC (FEIBA) or NovoSeven were to be only used for 
rescue therapy in the event of an insufficient response to study drug.

Other agents in the treatment of a bleeding episode, such as antifibrinolytics (e.g., aminocaproic acid 
or tranexamic acid) were allowed. 
The use of other sources of FVII(a), such as aPCC (FEIBA) or NovoSeven was only allowed when at 
least 24 hours had passed between the last administration of the bypassing agent and Cevenfacta 
administration in both Phase A and Phase B. In case the use of these products was for treatment of a 
bleeding episode, that specific bleeding episode was not allowed to be treated with Cevenfacta. 
•  Objectives 
The general objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of 
Cevenfacta across the full type of severity of bleeding episodes (mild, moderate, and severe), and to 
assess the PK of drug product produced by two different manufacturing processes (i.e., Process A and 
Process B). 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
For the EMA, the primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of bleeding episodes of all 
severity (mild, moderate, and severe) with a patient/caregiver-reported (for mild/moderate bleeding 
episodes) and physician-reported (for severe bleeding episodes) response of “good” or “excellent” 
at 12 hours after the initial Cevenfacta administration.  
Response to treatment was rated as “none”, “moderate”, “good”, or “excellent” (Table 15).  
Table 15. Categories of response to treatment 
Response 
Description 
None 
No noticeable effect of the treatment on the bleed or worsening of patient’s condition. 
Continuation of treatment with the study drug was needed. 
Moderate 
Some effect of the treatment on the bleed was noticed, e.g., pain decreased or bleeding signs 
improved, but bleed continued and required continued treatment with the study drug. 
Good 
Symptoms of bleed (e.g., swelling, tenderness, and decreased range of motion in the case of 
musculoskeletal haemorrhage) had largely been reduced by the treatment, but had not 
completely disappeared. Symptoms had improved enough to not require more 
infusions of the study drug. 
Excellent 
Full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleed (e.g., swelling, tenderness, and 
decreased range of motion in the case of musculoskeletal haemorrhage). No additional 
infusion of study drug was required. 
Source: (Amby, 2009), CSR 
A response of none or moderate was usually followed by continued treatment with study drug; “good” 
or “excellent” meant that no further treatment was needed or, in case of a severe bleeding 
episode, the dosing interval could be increased. 
Selected secondary efficacy endpoints and additional analyses: 
• Time to assessment of a “good” or “excellent” response of the bleeding episodes (mild/moderate and 
severe, separately and combined) by the patient (and/or physician when available) 
Assessment report

• Descriptive analysis of the number of administrations and mean total amount of Cevenfacta 
administered per bleeding episode 
• Proportion of recurrences (defined as a bleeding in the same joint/anatomical location within 24 
hours after an initial successful response)  
• Failures at 24 hours 
• Proportion of bleeding episodes requiring alternative treatment 
• Analyses by Cevenfacta Manufacturing Process 
•  Sample size 
The minimum sample size with 80% power was 22 patients with 352 mild/moderate bleedings. 
Assumptions included a true proportion of success of 0.70, a correlation among bleedings for a given 
patient of 0.1, and 8 mild/moderate bleedings per treatment regimen per patient. Each study was 
powered to detect a 15% point difference (from the OPC of 55% to the expected success rate of 70% 
for LR769) at 80% power with an alpha of 0.0125 (1-sided) for each treatment regimens. Success 
proportions were compared between the two treatment regimens using a 2-sided, normal 
approximation test. However, the comparison was not controlled for multiplicity and results were based 
on a nominal Type I error rate (alpha) of 0.05. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the effect of missing 
data (imputed as success or failure), the supportive analyses utilising the GEE and the GLMM models 
were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomised to one of the two treatment regimens (1:1 ratio) by entering the patient 
details in a web-based randomisation system associated with the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Patients remained on the initial dose regimen per randomisation for approximately 3 months before 
being switched to the other dose regimen. 
This is an open-label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
The protocol-specified success was defined as statistically significant higher success compared to the 
Objective Performance Criterion (OPC). The study was not powered for statistical comparison between 
the two dose regimens. The null hypothesis (H0) for the primary efficacy endpoint was p ≤0.55 where 
p is the true proportion of successfully treated mild or moderate bleeding events at 12 hours.

•  Numbers analysed 
The Treated population was defined as all enrolled patients who received at least one study drug 
administration to treat a bleeding episode during Phase B (=treatment phase; Phase A was the PK 
phase). All analyses of efficacy were performed based on the Treated Population. At a bleeding episode 
level, the analysis included all bleeding episodes treated with study drug, and each such bleeding 
episode was analysed as treated.

Secondary efficacy endpoints and additional analyses 
Time to Patient Assessment of “Good” or “Excellent” Response for Mild/Moderate Bleeding Episodes 
The median time to assessment of “good” or “excellent” response was approximately 3 hours shorter 
in the 225 μg/kg regimen (3.00 hours) compared with the 75 μg/kg regimen (5.98 hours). A 
comparison of results for 75 μg/kg versus 225 μg/kg showed a p = 0.001. 
Number of Administrations and Total Amount of Drug Administered Per Mild/Moderate Bleeding Episode 
The mean (SD) number of administrations of study drug per mild/moderate bleeding episode was 2.5 
(1.75) for the 75 μg/kg regimen and 1.4 (0.96) for the 225 μg/kg regimen. A comparison of the two 
Cevenfacta treatment regimens for number of administrations of study drug per mild/moderate 
bleeding episode showed a p <0.001. For the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen, the mean (SD) total 
amount of study drug (μg/kg) administered per mild/moderate bleeding episode was 187.87 (131.80) 
μg/kg, which corresponds with approximately 2.5 mean administrations of 75 μg/kg of drug. For the 
225 μg/kg treatment regimen, the mean (SD) total amount of study drug (μg/kg) administered per 
mild/moderate bleeding episode was 252.96 (78.97) μg/kg, which corresponds with 1.4 mean 
administrations of the treatment regimen for this dose group, i.e., patients received an initial injection 
of 225 μg/kg followed by 75 μg/kg, if needed. A comparison of the two treatment regimens for total 
amount of study drug administered per mild/moderate bleeding episode showed a p <0.001. 
Proportion of recurrence of bleeding episodes 
Bleeding recurrence was defined as a bleeding in the same joint/anatomical location within 24 hours 
after an initial successful response. Only one (0.2%) of the 468 bleeding episodes did recur.

Proportion of bleeding episodes, regardless of severity that did not require alternative treatment 
The majority (>98%) of bleeding episodes (regardless of severity) did not require alternative 
treatment: 98.4% (95% CI = 0.95.9%, 100%) of bleeding episodes treated with the 75 μg/kg 
regimen, and 99.5% (95% CI = 0.98.6%, 100%) of bleeding episodes treated with the 225 μg/kg 
regimen. A total of 5 bleeding episodes required alternative treatment. 
Severe bleeding events 
There were 3 severe bleeding episodes during the study. All 3 bleeding episodes were treated with the 
225 μg/kg regimen. The locations of the severe bleeding episodes were right hip (1 episode), soft 
tissue/muscle (1 episode), and ‘other’ (renal bleed; 1 episode). None of the episodes were in a target 
joint, were a recurring bleed, or required alternative treatment. Two of the episodes occurred 
spontaneously and 1 resulted from trauma. All 3 episodes required hospitalisation. 
Patient-reported assessment of “good” or “excellent” was reported for all 3 (100%) severe bleeds at 12 
hours and 24 hours. Physician-reported assessment of “good” or “excellent” was reported for all 3 
(100%) severe bleeds at the 12- and 24-hour timepoints. 
Analyses by Cevenfacta Manufacturing Process 
Process A and Process B of Cevenfacta manufacturing product were used during PerSept 1. Among the 
468 bleeding episodes analysed, 70.3% of bleeding episodes were treated with Cevenfacta produced 
with Process A, 18.4% with Process B, and 11.3% with both processes. Only Process B Cevenfacta 
manufacturing product was used during PerSept 2.

Study LFB-FVIIa-007-14 A: A Phase III Study on the Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Coagulation Factor VIIa (Recombinant) 
in Congenital Hemophilia A or B Pediatric Patients from Birth to <12 Years 
Old with Inhibitors to Factor VIII or IX (PERSEPT 2) 
Methods 
This was a global, multicentre, Phase 3, prospective, open-label, randomised, crossover study. 
•  Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
The main criteria for inclusion were: a diagnosis of haemophilia A or B with inhibitors (BU ≥5, or BU 
<5 but either expected to have a high anamnestic response to FVIII or FIX,  or expected to be 
refractory to increased dosing of FVIII or FIX, as demonstrated from the patient’s medical history, 
precluding the use of FVIII or FIX; be aged from birth to <12 years old. 
Exclusion Criteria 
The main exclusion criteria were: any coagulation disorder other than haemophilia A or B; 
immunosuppression (i.e., the patient should not have received systemic immunosuppressive 
medication, CD4 counts at screening should have been >200/μL); a known allergy or hypersensitivity 
to rabbits; a platelet count <100,000/mL 
•  Treatments 
Patients were randomised to start treatment with one of the two following study drug regimens: 
• 75 μg/kg Cevenfacta treatment regimen 
• 225 μg/kg Cevenfacta treatment regimen 
The assigned treatment regimen was the dose administered in Phase A and the starting dose in Phase 
B before crossover to the other treatment regimen. 
All levels of severity of bleeding episodes (mild, moderate, and severe) were allowed to be treated on 
the study. 
The dosing schemes employed in this trial were the same as described above for study PerSept 1. 
•  Objectives 
The general objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of 
Cevenfacta across the full type of severity of bleeding episodes (mild, moderate, and severe), and to 
assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Cevenfacta. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
For the EMA, the primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of bleeding episodes of all 
severity (mild, moderate, and severe) with a patient/caregiver-reported (for mild/moderate bleeding 
episodes) and physician-reported (for severe bleeding episodes) response of “good” or “excellent” 
at 12 hours after the initial Cevenfacta administration.

• Descriptive analysis of the number of administrations of Cevenfacta per bleeding episode 
•  Statistical methods 
The protocol-specified success was defined as statistically significant higher success compared to the 
Objective Performance Criterion (OPC). The study was not powered for statistical comparison between 
the two dose regimens. The null hypothesis (H0) for the primary efficacy endpoint was p ≤0.55 where 
p is the true proportion of successfully treated mild or moderate bleeding events at 12 hours. 
•  Numbers analysed 
Twenty-five enrolled and randomised patients (12 patients in the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen and 13 
patients in the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen) were included in the Safety and Treated populations. 
The Treated population was used for efficacy analyses.

Overall 
Patients were randomised to start the study 
with either 75 µg/kg or 225 µg/kg treatment 
regimen of Cevenfacta. The initial dose of the 
assigned dose regimen of Cevenfacta was 
administered in Phase A (initial safety and 
pharmacokinetic [PK] phase) and the assigned 
dose regimen for the first 12-week period in 
Phase B (treatment phase). Thereafter, the 
patient was crossed over to the alternate 
treatment regimen every 12 weeks until the 
end of the study.  
12 patients were randomised to receive 75 
µg/kg first, then 225 µg/kg and 13 patients 
randomised to receive 225 µg/kg first, then 75 
µg/kg.

Ancillary analyses 
Table 30: Addendum- primary efficacy endpoints by EMA definition and stratified by age 
group: Bleeding episodes with a patient- reported (for mild/moderate bleeding episodes) or 
physician-reported (for severe bleeding episodes) response of “ Good” or “Excellent” at 12 
hours after initial Cevenfacta administration (treated population) 
The evaluation of bleeding successes according to age subgroups shows a higher efficacy in the <2 
years group, however due to the very small number of bleeds no firm conclusions can be drawn.

Tertile: Bleeding episodes with a patient- reported (for mild/moderate bleeding episodes) or 
physician-reported (for severe bleeding episodes) response of “ Good” or “Excellent” at 12 
hours after initial LR769 administration (treated population) 
The analysis of the primary endpoint according to BMI subgroups shows increasing efficacy with 
increasing BMI. As subjects receive a weight-based dose, an increased dose of Cevenfacta despite a 
similar intravascular compartment in patients with the same height but higher weight leads to better 
outcomes, further lending support to the notion that children might be under dosed with the adult 
dosing regimen.

In the responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant provided an analysis of the primary efficacy outcome 
according to bodyweight category: 
Table 32: primary efficacy endpoint – successful treatment bleeding episodes at 12 hours 
regardless of severity by age and WHO weight categories (treated population) 
The applicant provided evaluation of efficacy and estimated PK parameters in the three bodyweight 
categories. There was a trend towards lack of efficacy in underweight children <12 years of age, while 
in the other age and weight groups no comparable impact on efficacy outcomes was evident. 
Estimated exposure in overweight patients was comparable to that in normal weight subjects.

Surgery trial: Study LFB-FVIIa-008-14 (PerSept 3) 
Design 
This is a Phase 3 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Coagulation Factor VIIa (Recombinant) for the 
Prevention of Excessive Bleeding in Congenital Haemophilia A or B Patients with Inhibitors to Factor 
VIII or IX Undergoing Elective Surgery or Other Invasive Procedures (PERSEPT 3).  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of Cevenfacta to prevent excessive 
bleeding and achieve haemostasis in haemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX 
undergoing elective surgical or other invasive procedures.

Cevenfacta infusions, the treatment interval may have been shortened in consecutive doses within the 
dosing guidelines (shown above). If the patient required further treatment with Cevenfacta after 
discharge, the patient would have administered Cevenfacta at home according to the investigator’s 
judgment and the dosing guidelines.

Administration of an FVIIa-containing product such as aPCC (FEIBA) or NovoSeven was only permitted 
for rescue therapy. Other agents for the prevention of excessive bleeding during surgical or other 
invasive procedures, such as antifibrinolytics, were allowed. 
Aspirin, NSAIDs, herbs, natural medications, and any other drug with platelet inhibitory properties, 
were to be discontinued at least 1 week prior to elective surgical or other invasive procedure and for 
the duration of treatment with Cevenfacta). 
All concomitant therapies, including the use of blood products, such as red blood cells, platelets, fresh 
frozen plasma, fibrinogen, etc., were recorded in the patients’ medical records and/or patients’ diaries 
and in the eCRF.  
Study subjects 
A total of 12 patients (6 each in the minor and major surgery groups) were enrolled into the study. 
Two patients were discontinued prematurely from the study. Among these patients, one patient, who 
underwent a minor surgical procedure, discontinued as withdrew his consent, whereas another patient, 
who underwent a major surgical procedure, discontinued due to a TEAE (post-procedural hematoma). 
This TEAE was a SAE, namely haemorrhagic anaemia and caused patient’s death. This patient died due 
to haemorrhagic anaemia. This was the only death that occurred during the study. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Patients ranged in age from 2 years old to 56 years old. Patients in the minor surgery group had a 
mean age (16 years) which was approximately one half of that of patients in the major surgery group 
(34 years). Due to the age difference between the surgery groups, the mean weight at screening was 
lower in the minor surgery group (36.72 kg) compared with the major surgery group (54.17 kg). 
All 12 patients had severe haemophilia A. Five (41.7%) patients had a BU titre ≥5 at screening (by 
local laboratory). Six patients (50.0%) had a BU <5 but were expected to have high anamnestic 
response to FVIII, based on a history of anamnestic responses between 6.0 and 50.6 BU. The 
remaining patient (8.3%) had a BU <5 but was expected to be refractory to increased dosing of FVIII 
products to treat bleedings, as he had been refractory to dosing in the past.

Efficacy assessment 
The patient’s response to treatment with Cevenfacta was recorded as “excellent,” “good,” “moderate,” 
or “poor.” at several timepoints: 
• 
• 
The intraoperative efficacy of Cevenfacta was assessed by the surgeon/practitioner 
immediately after completion of the procedure. 
Postoperative efficacy assessments were made by the investigator or designee at 24 hours 
after procedure completion, at 24-hour intervals while treatment with Cevenfacta was ongoing, 
after the last dose of Cevenfacta, and at 48 hours after the last dose of Cevenfacta or at early 
termination. 
The surgeon’s/practitioner’s rating of intraoperative efficacy of Cevenfacta was based on the actual 
blood loss compared to the maximum expected volume of blood loss in a patient without a bleeding 
disorder estimated and recorded prior to surgery, the amount of fluid replacement given, transfusion 
requirements, hemodynamic stability, etc. The response was defined as follows: 
• 
Excellent: intraoperative blood loss that was similar to or less than expected for this type of 
procedure in a patient without a bleeding disorder and who underwent the same surgical or 
other invasive procedure; no blood component transfusion was required 
•  Good: intraoperative blood loss that was greater than expected (but not more than 50% 
greater) for this type of procedure in a patient without a bleeding disorder and who underwent 
the same surgical or other invasive procedure; no unexpected increased blood component 
transfusion requirement 
•  Moderate: intraoperative blood loss that was substantially greater than expected (more than 
50% greater) for this type of procedure in a patient without a bleeding disorder and who 
underwent the same surgical or other invasive procedure, not explained by a surgical/medical 
issue other than haemophilia; additional blood component (within 2-fold greater than 
expected) transfusion was necessary 
• 
Poor: uncontrolled intraoperative blood loss, not explained by a surgical/medical issue other 
than haemophilia, that required intervention (rescue therapy requirement [bypass agent or 
porcine FVIII], and/or increased blood component [>2-fold greater than expected] transfusion, 
and/or led to hypotension or unexpected transfer to the intensive care unit [ICU]) 
The investigator’s/designee’s rating of haemostasis on post-operative days took into account the 
following definition: 
• 
Excellent: postoperative blood loss that was similar to or less than expected following this type 
of procedure in a patient without a bleeding disorder and who underwent the same surgical or 
other invasive procedure; no blood component transfusion was required 
•  Good: postoperative blood loss that was greater than expected following this type of procedure

in a patient without a bleeding disorder and who underwent the same surgical or other invasive 
procedure, not explained by a surgical/medical issue other than haemophilia; no unexpected 
need for blood component transfusion 
•  Moderate: postoperative blood loss that was substantially greater than expected following this 
type of procedure in a patient without a bleeding disorder and who underwent the same 
surgical or other invasive procedure, not explained by a surgical/medical issue other than 
haemophilia; additional blood component [within 2-fold greater than expected] transfusion was 
necessary 
• 
Poor: uncontrolled postoperative blood loss, not explained by a surgical/medical issue other 
than haemophilia that required intervention (rescue therapy requirement [bypass agent or 
porcine FVIII], and/or increased blood component [>2-fold greater than expected] transfusion, 
and/or led to hypotension or unexpected transfer to the ICU) 
Primary efficacy endpoint: “good” or “excellent” assessment by the investigator 48 (±4) hours after 
the last administration of Cevenfacta (postoperative assessment) 
The final assessment (which represented the primary efficacy outcome) was performed by the 
investigator at the study centre 48 (±4) hours after the last dose of Cevenfacta and was based 
upon the totality of the assessments performed on the patient at each timepoint.  
Of the 12 surgical procedures performed, 9 (81.8%) procedures were reported by the investigator as 
successfully treated (“good” or “excellent” response) with Cevenfacta at 48 hours after the last 
administration of Cevenfacta, 2 (18.2%) were treatment failures (“poor” response), and 1 assessment 
was missing because of discontinuation from the study (withdrawal of consent) prior to the assessment 
at 48 hours (Table 30). The narratives for the treatment failures are described in a section below. 
Table 37: Primary efficacy endpoint: “Good” or “Excellent” assessment by the investigator 
48 (±4) hours after the last administration of Cevenfacta (efficacy population) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Number of bleeding episode requiring transfusion between the start of the procedure and 48 (±4) 
hours after the last administration of Cevenfacta 
Only 1 patient required a transfusion for a bleeding episode between the start of the surgical procedure 
and 48 (±4) hours after the last administration of Cevenfacta. See the narrative below.

Number and Type of Bleeding Events at the Surgical Site Between the Start of the Procedure and 48 
(±4) Hours After the Last Administration of Cevenfacta 
Only 1 patient had a bleeding event (moderate) at the surgical site (right knee) between the start of 
the surgical procedure and 48 (±4) hours after the last administration of Cevenfacta (see below). 
Number of Surgical Interventions/Re-explorations for Bleeding Between the Start of the Procedure and 
48 (±4) Hours After the Last Administration of Cevenfacta 
No patient required such an intervention. 
“Good” or “excellent” assessment by the surgeon/practitioner for the intraoperative period and 
estimated actual intraoperative blood loss compared to maximum predicted blood loss 
The surgeon/practitioner assessed intraoperative treatment with Cevenfacta as successful (“good” or 
“excellent” response) for all 12 of the minor and major surgeries (100% [95% CI = 73.5%, 100%]).

Amount of Cevenfacta used 
Table 39: Total amount of Cevenfacta, number of administrations, and duration of treatment 
by surgical/invasive procedures 
Narratives for treatment failures: 
One patient was a 40-50-year-old male with a BMI of 18.0-19.0 kg/m2. Previous bleeding medication 
included FEIBA (2000 U). In the study, the patient underwent a major surgical procedure on his right 
knee. The patient received 200 μg/kg loading dose of Cevenfacta followed by 75 μg/kg doses of 
Cevenfacta every 2 hours for 4 days, and then 75 μg/kg every 4 hours thereafter. The intraoperative 
efficacy assessment by the surgeon was “excellent”. The actual intraoperative blood loss was 
estimated to 50 mL compared to a maximum predicted blood loss of 150 mL. About 12 hours after 
completion of the procedure, the patient required administration of 4 units of red blood cells due to 
severe anaemia (6.4 g/dL) and the investigator reported a moderate response (assessment outside the 
protocol visit). No postoperative efficacy assessment at 24 hours was performed. At 48 and 72 hours 
after completion of the procedure the efficacy assessments were “excellent” as well as at 82 and 106 
hours after completion of the procedure (assessments outside the protocol visits). Within 24 hours of 
the patient’s last dose of Cevenfacta, i.e. 7 to 8 days after completion of the procedure, the patient 
had a moderate bleeding episode at the surgical site that required a transfusion with 3 units of packed 
red blood cells and alternative therapy with NovoSeven (90 and 270 μg/kg IV). The efficacy 
assessment was “poor”. At 48 hours after the last dose of Cevenfacta was also “poor”. 
Another patient was a 50-60-year-old male who had previously participated in study RBFVIIa-006-13 
(PerSept 1). In PerSept 1, he had experienced 25 mild/moderate bleeding episodes. All bleeding 
events were successfully treated. No bleeding episode recurred, required a visit to the hospital, or 
required alternative treatment. He completed his participation in PerSept 1 and he was enrolled in 
PerSept 3 15 months thereafter. At study entry, this patient’s BMI was 31.0-32.0 kg/m2. Previous 
bleeding medication included FEIBA (4000 U). He underwent venous catheter placement with a 
treatment with FEIBA (5000 U), which took place 8 days before he received his first dose of Cevenfacta 
in PerSept 3. In the study, the patient underwent a major surgical procedure of right hip replacement. 
He received a 200 μg/kg loading dose of Cevenfacta followed by 75 μg/kg doses of Cevenfacta every 2 
hours. 
Assessment report

The intraoperative efficacy assessment by the surgeon was “excellent.” The actual intraoperative blood 
loss was estimated to 250 mL compared to a maximum predicted blood loss of 500 mL. At 24 hours 
after completion of the procedure, the efficacy was assessed as “good.” Post-procedural hematoma 
formation was observed the day after the surgery. The patient’s haemoglobin decreased to 111 g/L, 
(158 g/L at screening) which was considered abnormal and clinically significant. The increased 
hematoma was assessed as Cevenfacta inefficacy leading to a withdrawal of study drug 1 day after 
completion of the procedure and discontinuation from the study. This patient’s imputed efficacy 
response was classified as “poor” for the 48 [±4] hours after the last dose of Cevenfacta timepoint 
assessment. 
Rescue medication with FEIBA (4500 U IV three times daily) was administered after the early 
termination visit. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were administered without pain 
relief; analgesia was achieved with fentanyl (25 μg/hour, subcutaneous) and trimeperidine 2% (1 mL 
IV). The post-procedural hematoma was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to 
treatment with Cevenfacta. 
Three days after the surgery, the patient experienced acute haemorrhagic anaemia resulting from a 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which complicated his haemophilia A. He suffered cardiopulmonary 
arrest and died. An autopsy revealed severe anaemia of the visceral organs, a large intermuscular 
haematoma of the right hip, signs of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, acute haemorrhagic anaemia, and 
interstitial pulmonary oedema. There were no signs of chronic stomach ulcer or cirrhosis. The 
investigator considered the haemorrhagic anaemia and gastrointestinal haemorrhage to be serious and 
probably related to treatment with Cevenfacta due to temporal association and disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, there was no clinical evidence, nor any autopsy findings to 
indicate DIC, and the patient had been switched from Cevenfacta to FEIBA approximately 3 days 
before the gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Analysis performed by the sponsor and the data monitoring 
committee concluded that the postoperative administration of NSAIDs followed by gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage and acute haemorrhagic anaemia, coupled with the fact that the terminal half-life of 
Cevenfacta is approximately 2 hours, suggested that these serious adverse events were unlikely to be 
related to treatment with Cevenfacta. Of note, with the responses to the D120 LoQ, it was confirmed 
that no postoperative NSAIDs were administered. The latest intake of an NSAID was one week before 
the surgery. Regarding the question why acute haemorrhagic anaemia was mainly attributed to the 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, the autopsy report was provided indicating that the participant lost up 
to 2,500 mL blood in the gastric lumen, small gut and colonic loops. 
2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The provided efficacy data for Cevenfacta comprise results from three clinical trials investigating either 
the treatment of bleeding events (PerSept1: patients ≥ 12 years, PerSept2: <12 years) or the 
prevention of excessive bleeding during elective surgery or invasive procedures (PerSept3: patients ≥6 
months to ≤75 years) in subjects with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors.  
In both PerSept1 and 2, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two dosing regimens, which 
differed by the strength of the initial bolus dose and the intervals of the subsequent infusions. One 
dosing scheme was to administer 75 µg/kg, followed by (if necessary) additional 75 µg/kg 
administrations every 3 hours for up to 21 hours (for severe bleeding events: every 2 hours until 
improvement). The alternative dosing scheme involved a high bolus infusion of 225 µg/kg. If 
necessary, this was followed by a second dose of 75 µg/kg 9 hours later and additional doses every 3 
hours until up to 21 hours. For severe bleeding events, the second dose (75 µg/kg) was scheduled 6

hours after the bolus infusion and the intervals of the subsequent doses were shortened to 2 hours. 
Every 3 months, patients crossed over to the alternate treatment regimen. 
In the PerSept1 trial, a total of 27 patients were enrolled at 11 different study sites, mainly in Eastern 
Europe and the US, and received Cevenfacta for the treatment of in total 468 bleeding episodes (465 
mild/moderate, 3 severe). The PerSept2 trial enrolled 25 patients from 8 sites in Europe, America and 
South Africa. The CSR includes data on 549 treated bleeding events (546 mild/moderate, 3 severe).  
Among the 52 patients enrolled in the on-demand treatment studies (PerSept1 + PerSept2), there 
were only 4 haemophilia B patients (severe, with inhibitors). The remaining patients were patients with 
haemophilia A with inhibitors (45x severe, 3x moderate). In PerSept1, ~50% of patients had BU ≥5, 
and ~40% of patients had BU <5 but were expected to have a high anamnestic response to FVIII or 
FIX. The other had BU <5 but were expected to be refractory to increased doses. In PerSept 2: ~24% 
of patients had BU <5 but were expected to have a high anamnestic response to FVIII or FIX, and 4% 
of patients had BU <5 but were expected to be refractory to increased dosing of FVIII or FIX. The 
other patients had BU ≥5. 
The PerSept3 trial presents data from 12 patients with severe haemophilia A with inhibitors, who 
underwent 12 surgeries/invasive procedures (6 minor, 6 major surgeries) at 8 sites in 5 countries 
(South Africa, Mexico, Eastern Europe). For minor procedures, the subjects received an initial dose of 
75 µg/kg within 2 minutes of the surgical incision or invasive procedure. This was followed by 
subsequent administration of 75 µg/kg every 2 hours and increasing intervals during the following 
days, based on the judgement of the investigator. For major surgeries, the initial dose prior to surgical 
incision was 200 µg/kg, followed by 75 µg/kg every 2 hours for 48 hours. The intervals for the 
subsequent days/weeks were more flexible. 
The in- and exclusion criteria selected a patient population with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors with 
either a high BU titre or a high anamnestic response when displaying titres <5 BU. In the absence of a 
specific guideline for factor VII products, the BWP and CHMP agreed that the “Guideline on clinical 
investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor IX products” 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009 Rev. 1), can be regarded as an appropriate reference for different 
aspects of the development of Cevenfacta. The in- and exclusion criteria and number of recruited 
patients for the three PerSept trials are in line with this guidance and repeated scientific advice given 
by the CHMP.  
Due to very small target patient population a non-inferiority trial with an active comparator was not 
considered feasible and a placebo control not possible due to ethical reasons. Therefore a non-
controlled study design was accepted by CHMP in frame of a scientific advice procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/424687/2011), also because no claim beyond bleeding control is sought. Further, 
historical control with bleeding control rates from trials with NovoSeven and FEIBA was deemed 
sufficient for benefit-risk assessment. In order to formalise this historical control, the applicant defined 
a pre-specified objective performance criterion (OPC) = 0.55, against which the proportion of success 
for the pivotal studies were compared. This OPC was determined by reviewing the literature on the 
reported success of treatment with bypassing agents. The identified published data describe treated 
bleeding events mainly in adults with only few paediatric subjects included. In addition, a three-point 
rating scale is used in several trials, which could skew results into the more effective range. CHMP 
recognised these uncertainties in the scientific advice procedure and stated that at MAA, the totality of 
the data available will be evaluated regarding the benefit risk ratio of each investigated dosing 
regimen.  
A discrepancy was noted with regard to patients with high anamnestic response to FVIII or FIX 
between the inclusion criteria and the claimed indication (FVIII or IX inhibitor titre BU<5 for inclusion 
criteria and high-response inhibitors to FVIII or IX (BU≥5) in the claimed indication). This discrepancy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 99/137 
 
 
 
in the wording of the indication was amended by the applicant. The inclusion of patients on ITI is 
accepted; eptacog beta is not expected to increase the inhibitor titre and the intensive FVIII or FIX 
administration may increase the anamnestic response to FVIII or FIX. Unlike PERSEPT 1 and 2, 
patients receiving ITI therapy were excluded from PERSEPT 3. The applicant justified the difference on 
ITI therapy between PerSept 1and 2 and PerSept 3 by the difficulty to pursue such treatment in 
patients hospitalised for surgery. 
Efficacy was assessed by the patient/caregiver and recorded in the patient diary and, if treated in the 
hospital, also by the physician. A 4-point haemostatic scale for the response assessment was used as 
recommended in the Guidelines for clinical development of recombinant FVIII and FIX. The four 
categories of response to treatment “none”, “moderate”, “good” and “excellent” were based on the 
assessment of pain and objective signs of bleed (i.e. swelling, tenderness and decreased range of 
motion in the case of musculoskeletal haemorrhage). It was mentioned in the dossier that a visual 
analogue scale (VAS) to rate pain was completed to assess response of pain to treatment in the patient 
diary. Nevertheless the assessment of the other parameters relative to signs of bleed were not 
mentioned. In the D120 LoQ it was asked how these parameters were recorded by the 
patient/caregiver in order to rate the response to treatment of a bleeding episode as “excellent,” 
“good,” “moderate,” or “none.”  The applicant indicated that the criteria relative to signs of bleed such 
as swelling, tenderness and decreased ROM assessed by the patient for mild/moderate bleeding and 
physician for severe bleeding have not been collected and rated individually and that they were part of 
the global 4-point scale. Signs of bleed are indeed considered as subjective criterion while the overall 
product consumption and the pain as assessed by a VAS, both recorded, allowed a more objective 
assessment in the 4-point scale.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the PerSept1 and PerSept2 studies was defined as the proportion of 
bleeding episodes regardless of severity (mild, moderate and severe) with a patient/caregiver-reported 
(for mild/moderate bleeding episodes) and physician-reported (for severe bleeding episodes) response 
of “good” or “excellent” on the 4-point haemostatic scale at 12 hours after initial administration of 
Cevenfacta. 
In the PerSept1 and PerSept2 trials, the study duration was specified as “until at least 352 bleeding 
episodes had been treated and at least 6 months had passed since first administration”. However, 
substantially higher numbers of bleeding episodes were reported in the final CSRs (PerSept1: 468, 
PerSept2: 549). The mean duration of exposure was 6.6 months in PerSept1, and 11.2 months in 
PerSept2. According to the protocol of PerSept1, an interim analysis was planned after 80% (or 282 
bleeding episodes) of the initial planned sample size of 352 bleeding episodes had been treated. This 
meeting was to discuss an analysis prepared by an independent statistician on the conditional power of 
the study and the need for a sample size re-estimation. No results of this interim analysis is provided, 
despite the substantial deviations from the study protocol. The studies are unblinded and subjectivity 
is involved in the assessment of the primary endpoint, both of which violates the recommendations in 
the EMA guideline on METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES IN CONFIRMATORY CLINICAL TRIALS PLANNED WITH 
AN ADAPTIVE DESIGN. The applicant was asked to provide an explanation for the lack of adherence to 
the study protocol and to demonstrate that the alterations were not done in a data-driven manner. In 
the responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant provided background information from the DMC 
meetings. The study ended upon the study completion of the 27 patients already treated at the time of 
the third DMC Meeting. These 27 patients ultimately registered a total of 468 bleeding episodes (465 
mild/moderate and 3 severe). 
Furthermore, the applicant was asked to provide additional efficacy analyses for both PerSept (1+2) 
studies, including only the first 352 bleeding events, as initially planned in the original protocol. In the 
responses, the applicant only addressed the PerSept1 study. The sensitivity analysis after 352 bleeding 
events shows very similar point estimates and confidence intervals compared to the primary endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 100/137 
 
 
 
No further concern is raised regarding the PerSept1 study. 
However, the overrun of bleeding episodes was even higher for the PerSept2 trial. In total, 549 
bleeding episodes were treated. The applicant was asked to provide the same sensitivity analysis for 
PerSept2, including a justification for the overrun. Of note, the mean treatment duration of exposure 
during PerSept 1 was 6.6 months (n=27), while the mean duration of exposure was 11.2 months 
(n=25) during PerSept2.  In the responses to the D180 LoOI, the applicant convincingly explained that 
a lower than expected median bleeding rate (observed rate 1.4 BEs/month vs assumed rate 2.67 
BEs/month) caused the longer mean duration of exposure in PersSept2, compared to PerSept1. Two 
subjects with an unusually high number of BEs (these 2 participants experienced in total 120 BEs) did 
also strongly contribute to the overrun. No sensitivity analysis was provided for PerSept2, since the 
applicant decided to exclude the respective population from the label, which is acceptable. 
Several changes to the statistical methods were done as part of PerSept 1 protocol amendments. Due 
to the open-label nature of study, the applicant was requested to comment on the timing of these 
amendments with regards to patient enrolment and data accumulation. As requested, the applicant 
provided further clarifications regarding the timing of protocol amendments and therefore of the main 
changes in statistical methods with regards to patient enrolment. The content and impact of each 
protocol amendment was described, and the number of patients enrolled, the number of treated 
bleeding episodes and the point estimates for the primary endpoint are summarised at the time of 
each protocol amendment. It is noted that some of the key changes in statistical methods, introduced 
with protocol amendments 1 and 2, were implemented before first patient enrolled. It is agreed that 
such changes can be considered independent of the subsequent trends in the accumulating data. 
Other methodological issues were raised regarding the lack of proper control of multiplicity, a clear 
justification for the usage of the OPC of 55%, or the consequence of treatment withdrawal with respect 
to further treatment and bleeding outcome. 
Not all methodological issues were resolved in the end. For example, for people who are withdrawn 
from treatment with the study drug, the remaining bleeding episodes (after withdrawal) should be 
documented and included as failure in the efficacy assessment. The responses by the applicant could 
also not clarify whether ALL bleeding events during the whole study period have been treated with 
Cevenfacta or whether some of the events were treated with alternative treatments (without 
documentation). The difficulty of evaluating events that were not reported is acknowledged, but the 
concern arises whether or not the reporting of bleeding events is independent of the perceived efficacy 
of their treatment. An introduction of bias cannot be ruled out, especially because most patients were 
treated at home. The estimate of the rate of treatment failure in the population of bleeds that were 
reported could not be representative of the overall rate of failure. The applicant has also not provided 
adequate reasoning for the value of the OPC from a clinical or methodological perspective. However, 
these issues are not further pursued, since the main aspects of the study design have been agreed 
with during several previous EMA-SA procedures.  
Missing data were excluded from the primary analysis of the phase 3 studies, which could result in 
biased primary analysis estimates. The applicant performed sensitivity analyses where missing 
assessments were not excluded to assess the robustness of the main results. In order to better 
understand the potential implications of missing data, the applicant was requested to provide further 
clarifications regarding the reasons for missing assessments. The applicant describes the <5% missing 
rate as being acceptable and argues that a primary analysis based on observed cases is standard 
practice. This is not agreed, and missing data should generally be accounted for in the primary 
analysis, especially when missing not at random (MNAR) data patterns are suspected, as in the present 
situation. Indeed, the review of bleeding episodes with missing responses indicates, as acknowledged 
by the applicant, an estimation bias with an overestimation of the proportion of success. Due to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 101/137 
 
 
 
limited information and absence of collected reason for missing data, this bias cannot be precisely 
quantified. Therefore, as part of the D180 LoOI, it was requested that the SmPC summary table should 
be updated for the primary analysis results (point and interval estimations) based on the analysis 
where bleeding episodes with missing assessments are considered as failures. The applicant changed 
the respective table accordingly. 
In the PerSept3 trial, the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of surgical or other invasive 
procedures with a “good” or “excellent” response to Cevenfacta treatment 48 (±4) hours after the last 
administration of Cevenfacta as assessed by the investigator. 
The patient’s response to treatment with Cevenfacta was recorded as “excellent,” “good,” “moderate,” 
or “poor” at several timepoints: 
• The intraoperative efficacy of Cevenfacta was assessed by the surgeon/practitioner immediately after 
completion of the procedure. 
• Postoperative efficacy assessments were made by the investigator or designee at 24 hours after 
procedure completion, at 24-hour intervals while treatment with Cevenfacta was ongoing, after the last 
dose of Cevenfacta, and at 48 hours after the last dose of Cevenfacta or at early termination. 
The evaluation of response to treatment was in line with the Guidelines on the clinical investigation of 
FVIII and FIX products stating that response should be assessed as “none”, “moderate”, “good” or 
“excellent” by the physician including efficacy of haemostasis, loss of blood, and requirements for 
transfusion. The response to treatment were to be assessed by two different operators, which is 
acknowledged since different physicians are involved in intra- and post-operation but this may induce 
variability in evaluation. The postoperative efficacy assessment timepoints (i.e., at 24 [±2] hours after 
completion of the surgical procedure, and then every 24 [±2] hours while treatment was ongoing, at 
the time of the last dose, at 48 hours after the last dose, and at early termination) should be justified 
in light with the administration of treatment that is done more frequently. The applicant’s justification 
of the timing of the efficacy assessments was mainly based on the two studies supporting the approval 
of Novoseven, which is acknowledged in the lack of dedicated guideline. The issue was not further 
pursued. 
The pre-operative and operative doses for major surgery are 200 μg/kg immediately before the 
surgery, followed by 75 μg/kg every 2 hours for the duration of the surgery with further 
recommendations for post-operative doses. The applicant was asked to clarify the rationale for the 200 
μg/kg pre-operative dose. In the responses, the applicant cited a publication (UK consensus protocol 
for the use of FVIIa in orthopaedic surgeries, Giangrande et al., 2009), which recommends the use of a 
bolus dose between 120–180 µg/kg of NovoSeven to cover surgery. The applicant describes that the 
reason for picking the 200 µg/kg dose was based on the intention to remain close to both the cited 
study and the Phase 1 PK/PD study. From an efficacy point of view, the decision to study the 200 
µg/kg dose for prevention of bleeding during major surgeries is understood. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study designs and populations of the available published clinical trials with other bypassing agents 
differ in terms of several important aspects, such as the definition and time point of the primary 
endpoints, modality of treated bleeds (e.g. only joint bleeds) and the included subjects (e.g. mostly 
adults) from the PerSept studies. This clearly hampers the comparability of the obtained results with 
those of the published trials and limits the usefulness of the predefined OPC. 
In PerSept1, the primary endpoint is met for both dose regimens with a proportion of 
mild/moderate/severe bleeding episodes that were successfully treated at 12 hours of 85.7% (95% CI 
= 75.0%, 96.4%) for the 75 μg/kg regimen and 93.8% (95% CI = 88.9%, 98.6%) for the 225 μg/kg 
Assessment report

Page 102/137 
 
 
 
regimen (p<0.001). A higher success proportion is shown with the 225µg/kg dose regimen compared 
to the 75 µg/kg dose. It is however noted that no imputation was made for missing values in the 
primary efficacy analysis, with a number of missing bleeding episodes of 22 (4.7%). Assigning missing 
assessments as failures would be the more conservative approach and appears more appropriate. This 
results in a proportion of 89.8% successfully treated bleeding episodes (194/216 bleedings) for 
subjects receiving an initial dose of 225 µg/kg, compared to 80.2% (202/252) for the dose of 75 
µg/kg. These point estimates are similar to published results with NovoSeven and FEIBA and also 
comparable to expected outcomes for factor VIII or IX treatment in haemophilia without inhibitors. The 
subgroup analysis by inhibitor level shows a lower successfully treated bleeding in the low titre group 
compared to the high titre group for both dose regimens.  The discrepancy observed in the successful 
treatment between patients with low titre inhibitors and high titre inhibition could not be clearly 
justified by the applicant that suggests a possible impact of the immune response (type of antibodies, 
epitope specificity, kinetics, mechanisms of inhibition of FVIII function, etc.) or genetic factors. It was 
noted that this discordance across the two subpopulations was also observed in PerSept 2. The issue 
was not further pursued. 
In terms of time to assessment of a successful response (= ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ assessment) there was 
a clear difference between the two treatment regimens, with a median of 3 hours for the 225 µg/kg 
group and 6 hours for the 75 µg/kg group. As expected, a lower number of study drug administrations 
were necessary for the 225 µg/kg group (mean 1.4, median 1.0 administrations) compared to the 75 
µg/kg group (mean 2.5, median 2.0 administrations). On the other hand, the higher bolus infusion of 
225 µg/kg resulted in a higher total amount of study drug administered (mean 252.96 µg/kg, median 
225.09 µg/kg) compared to the lower dose bolus infusion of 75 µg/kg (mean 187.87 µg/kg, median 
149.68 µg/kg) for the treatment of mild/moderate bleeding events. 
The posology section of the currently proposed SmPC indicates both treatment regimen, while 
suggesting that dose, frequency and duration of Cevenfacta therapy should be based on the patient’s 
clinical response and haemostasis evaluation. This is in line with the SmPC of NovoSeven and flexibility 
based on individual response is endorsed. Further, this may also have a dose sparing effect in 
individuals with sufficient response to the lower dosed bolus infusion. 
One patient reported 4 bleeding events (2x right elbow, 2x right knee) on mid Q4 2014. Based on the 
provided information, these bleeding events might have been rated as bleeding recurrence. The 
applicant was asked in the D120 LoQ to comment and to provide more information about these events. 
In the responses, the applicant clarified that the second bleedings occurred more than 24 hours after 
the last treatment of the previous bleeding. Therefore, these events did not meet the criteria of a 
bleeding recurrence (as defined in the protocol). 
During the PerSept1 trial, a new manufacturing product was introduced (commercial product, upscaled 
Process B). In principle, the results of the PerSept1 trial suggest that Cevenfacta is sufficiently 
efficacious for the treatment of bleeding episodes. However, the presented efficacy results are 
compromised by the fact that only a relatively small fraction of patients received product of the 
commercial Process B. Of the 468 bleeding episodes in PerSept1, only 18.4% were treated with 
product from process B and ~11.3% with a mixture of products from both processes. There was a high 
intra-subject variability for PK parameters such as Cmax and AUC. A reduced efficacy was noted for the 
225 µg/kg dosing regimen for Process B (~80%) compared to process A (~90%) in PerSept 1, 
therefore the bridging of outcomes observed with the clinical trial material to the commercial material 
is not straightforward. Considering that there were also some questions regarding the quality 
comparability exercise, two major objections were raised, one for the quality comparability exercise, 
and another overarching major objection regarding the PK and efficacy aspects. 
The MO regarding the quality comparability was solved by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 103/137 
 
 
 
Comparability of clinical data: The applicant pointed out that the haemostatic response did not differ 
statistically between Process A and Process B as the 97.5% CIs for the proportion of success overlap 
with each other. This is also the case if missing assessments are imputed as failure for the analysis. 
The applicant provided a detailed overview of the efficacy assessments for subjects who were treated 
with products from both manufacturing processes. Efficacy assessment at 12 hours was available for 
14 patients totalling 275 bleeding episodes, 196 treated with Process A and 79 treated with Process B. 
Each individual subject was discussed separately. The detailed overview of the treatment success in 
patients who received products from both manufacturing processes is reassuring and it can be agreed 
that no meaningful differences were observed. A comparison of safety data was provided as well and 
no further concern did arise.  
Despite the concluded comparability based on provided Quality data, comparability of the 
pharmacokinetic profile between process A and B cannot be concluded. However, data on efficacy and 
safety do not raise further concern on potential differences on applied manufacturing processes.  
Considering all the provided information, especially also the fact that the MO on the quality 
comparability was sufficiently addressed, this overarching major objection with respect to the clinical 
issues concerning the change in the manufacturing process during development was considered as 
resolved. 
Only 3 severe bleedings were treated during the trial PerSept1 (traumatic intramuscular, spontaneous 
right hip and, spontaneous renal haemorrhages). All three bleeding episodes achieved haemostasis at 
12 hours after the initial administration of Cevenfacta and did not require alternative treatment or 
retreatment. However, one patient was treated with a much higher dose than pre-specified in the 
protocol, one patient was concomitantly treated with an antihaemorrhagic (etamsylate) drug, and for 
one event it was initially not entirely clear why it was attributed as severe. The applicant was asked to 
provide more information regarding the concomitant treatment with etamsylate and to further 
elaborate why the bleeding event in one subject was considered as severe. The applicant clarified that 
the severe bleeding event was caused by a tongue bite. The event was considered as severe by the 
investigator due to its location in the mouth region and its traumatic origin. This is in line with the 
Classification of severity of bleeding episodes. It was also clarified that treatment with sodium 
etamsylate (in another patient) was initiated on the same day as the severe renal bleeding started 
(mid Q2 2015) and was continued for 3 days. According to the protocol, such concomitant treatment 
with sodium etamsylate (or other antihaemorrhagic drugs such as tranexamic acid) was not 
disallowed. Concomitant administration of etamsylate may confound the treatment effect of 
Cevenfacta. However, it is acknowledged that this treatment was allowed according to the protocol. In 
the real world situation, it would not be unusual to concomitantly administer other antihaemorrhagic 
agents such as antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid) as haemostatic support in some cases (as also 
suggested in the WFH guideline for the management of haemophilia). 
There were a total of 154 minor protocol deviations reported for 25 patients (12 patients in the 75 
μg/kg dose group and 13 patients in the 225 μg/kg dose group) during the study, mainly related to 
study procedures or assessments that were not performed according to the schedule in the protocol 
(75.3%). Missing efficacy assessment as part of protocol violation related to study procedure or 
assessment-related is considered as having an impact on efficacy analysis, taking into account that 
missing data are excluded from the primary analysis. The applicant was asked to discuss how the 
minor and/or major protocol violations related to compliance in study drug administration impacted the 
response to treatment of the bleeding episodes and efficacy results. The impact on efficacy of a large 
majority of protocol deviations related to compliance in study drug (47 of 83) occurring in two subjects 
could regrettably not be assessed due to the lack of assessment or record of efficacy data. From the 83 
protocol deviations related to compliance in study drug reported in PerSept 1, only 29 were recorded 
during the treatment of bleeding episodes and were considered by the applicant to have a potential 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022

impact on efficacy. Additional dosing administration after a good/excellent assessment occurred in 8 
bleeding episodes and are not expected to have an impact to the efficacy as assessed by the primary 
endpoint since the total number of IMP dose received before response was still compliant with the 
protocol recommendation for the treatment, but can affect the outcome of the secondary endpoint 
“number of administrations and total amount of drug administered per bleeding episode”. Moreover a 
good assessment was reached before the 12 hours timepoint of the primary endpoint in both 8 
bleeding episodes with additional dosing administration. Indeed the relevance of the sensitivity 
analysis regarding the effect of additional dosing administration on the primary endpoint when 
considering the bleeding episodes as failure if the assessment was preceded by additional dosing 
administration after good/excellent assessment at a previous assessment timepoint (N=8) is unclear, 
since additional dose administrations after improvement are not expected to impact efficacy. The point 
estimates in the SA are consistent with those from PA for the primary endpoint. 
It is noted that concomitant medications were administered twice as often to patients in the 75 μg/kg 
treatment regimen (92.3%) than to patients in the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen (42.9%). In 
particular analgesics and antihaemorrhagics treatment were more administered in the 75 μg/kg 
treatment regimen (38.5% and 46.2% respectively) compared to the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen 
(21.4% and 0 respectively). Blood coagulation factor other than FEIBA or Novoseven were 
administered in 4 (30.8%) subjects in the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen vs 0 in the 225 μg/kg 
treatment regimen. A total of 3 (11.1%) patients received a concomitant bypassing agent (FEIBA or 
Novoseven) during the study: 2 (15.4%) subjects in the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen and 1 (7.1%). 
The applicant was asked to discuss the more frequently use of concomitant medications in patients in 
the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen compared to the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen, in particular 
analgesics and antihaemorrhagics, in light of the response to Cevenfacta treatment of bleeding 
episodes. Although the discrepancies observed in the tables in the PerSept 1 CSR did not reflect the 
actual concomitant treatment use since these tables were stratified by treatment regimen assigned at 
randompaediatric, it is however noted that the use of rescue therapy was higher with the 75 µg/kg 
regimen than the 225µg/kg regimen, i.e. 4 vs 1 bleeding episodes respectively. Also concomitant 
medication other than bypassing, medical history or adverse event during the treatment of bleeding 
episodes (Table Q123-1) were administered in 4 patients for 5 bleeding episodes of which 4 were 
treated with the 75µg/kg regimen (NSAIDs for haemorrhage-related pain, antifibrinolytic and 
antibiotics for gingival infection associated to bleeding for 2 bleeding episodes and FVIII for bleeding 
prophylaxis) and one treated with the 225 µg/kg regimen (antihaemorrhagics and corticosteroids for a 
severe renal bleeding). Nevertheless, despite the higher numerical use of concomitant medications due 
to bleeding related events with 75 µg/kg compared to 225 µg/kg, the small number of cases prevents 
any clear conclusion on its relation to the efficacy of Cevenfacta. Of the 6 cases of analgesics, anti-
inflammatory and antirheumatic products, or antihaemorrhagic treatment that were started at the 
same time or during a bleeding episode, 5 had available assessments and 3 of them were for bleeding 
episodes or associated pain. The limited number of cases does not allow to highlight any imbalance 
across the 2 dose regimens. There were 94 bleedings episodes with ongoing concomitant treatment 
with analgesics, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, and or antihaemorrhagics of which 
comparable number of successfully treated bleedings in the 75 µg/kg and 225 µg/kg regimens (36 and 
31 respectively) but higher number of unsuccessfully treated bleedings in the 75 µg/kg regimen 
compared to the 225 µg/kg regimen (20 vs 4). However the use of these concomitant treatment 
started before the occurrence of the bleeding episode leading to the use of Cevenfacta so a lack of 
efficacy could not justify the discrepancy in the observed unsuccessfully treated bleeding episodes 
across the 2 dose regimens. 
With the D120 LoQ, the applicant was asked to provide separate efficacy results for mild and moderate 
bleeding episodes. In PerSept1, the majority of bleeding events was moderate in severity (~78%). 
Overall, the efficacy point estimates were higher for mild bleedings (treatment success: 93.3% for

both dose regimens combined) compared to moderate bleedings (treatment success: 82.8% for both 
dose regimen combined), which is not surprising. Interestingly, this difference was mainly caused by a 
weaker efficacy readout with the 75 µg/kg dose regimen (treatment success: 78%). 
Table 40. Primary efficacy endpoint – successful treatment of mild and moderate bleeding 
episodes at 12 hours by FDA and EMA definitions 
In PerSept 2, 546 of the 549 treated bleeding events were classified as mild/moderate. None of the 
three severe bleeding episodes that occurred during the study was assessed as a success. Two were 
treatment failures and for the third, the 12-hour assessment is missing. However, from the narratives 
it is clear that for each severe bleed in the first days no assessment better than moderate was 
reported. The very low number of severe bleeding episodes occurring in the study prevents any 
conclusion on the efficacy of eptacog beta for severe bleedings; nevertheless the efficacy results for 
these severe bleeding episodes are mentioned in the SmPC.  
66.1% of bleeding events treated with the 75µg/kg dose were successfully treated at 12 hours, as well 
as 61.3% of bleeds treated with the 225µg/kg dose in the total population. For both dosing schemes, 
the lower confidence intervals are below 55% as defined by the OPC, thus the study has formally failed 
its primary analysis. As mentioned in the description of the OPC in the introduction of the efficacy 
section, this fact alone will not lead to an automatic rejection of the trial outcomes as supportive of an 
indication in the investigated age group. Due to the fact that the OPC was defined using published 
outcomes of bleeding events treated with NovoSeven or FEIBA mostly in adults and often using a 3-
point bleeding scale, the relevance of this threshold to the paediatric population is unclear and should 
not constitute the main reason to reject a label in children <12 years of age. 
An analysis of the primary outcome for the two age cohorts showed the following results: For the <6-
year-old subjects, these values are 56.6% and 58.5% for 75µg/kg and 225µg/kg, respectively. For the 
6 to <12-year-old patients, the proportions are 73.7% and 63.8% for the two different dosing 
schemes. The lower bounds of the confidence intervals are below the pre-specified 55% in both age 
groups, except for the 75µg/kg dose in the older cohort.

It is established that younger children display a faster protein metabolism than older children or adults 
and usually a higher dose of coagulation factor VIII or IX is necessary to treat bleeding events in 
children with haemophilia compared to adults. Despite the fact that a faster clearance of Cevenfacta 
was observed in paediatric subjects (CL based on a median weight of 19 kg was 3.68 L/h (~194 
mL/h/kg; 25.1 %CV) in PerSept 2, while CL based on a median weight of 67.4 kg was 7.62 L/h (~113 
mL/h/kg; 26.4 %CV) in the PerSept 1 study), the same dose and interval as in adults was used for 
children in both age cohorts. A trend towards better treatment outcomes was observed in the 6 to <12 
cohort, supporting the notion that the selected dose and /or dosing interval should have been adapted 
for children. The analysis of the primary endpoint according to BMI subgroups shows increasing 
efficacy with increasing BMI. Due to weight-based dosing, an increased dose of Cevenfacta despite a 
similar intravascular compartment is administered in patients with the same height but higher weight 
and leads to better outcomes, further indicating that children might be underdosed with the adult 
dosing regimen. 
The median time to assessment of a good or excellent response was 9 hours for the 75µg/kg dose and 
12 hours for the 225µg/kg dose. As for the lower dose, a repeat administration was allowed every 3 
hours, this signifies the need for 3 doses of 75µg/kg (at 0, 3 and 6 hours) until success. For the higher 
dose, the initial treatment of 225µg/kg could be followed with a 75µg/kg dose at 9 hours, and the 
outcome of this endpoint signifies that the initial higher dose and at least one additional dose are 
needed for resolution of the bleed. It is apparent that a more frequent administration of Cevenfacta 
leads to an earlier resolution of the bleeding event in children <12 years of age. However, compared to 
outcomes from PerSept 1, where a median of 3 hours for the 225 µg/kg group and 6 hours for the 75 
µg/kg group passed until a good/ excellent response was reported, these values emphasise the inferior 
bleed control in younger children compared to adolescents and adults. 
In order to show if there is a substantial difference in efficacy, the applicant was asked to provide 
separate efficacy results for mild and moderate bleeding episodes for PerSept2. 
In their responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant submitted the following analysis:

While the success proportion of mild bleeding events is clearly in favour of treatment with eptacog beta 
at both the 75µg and the 225µg dose, the success proportion for moderate bleeding events is only 
55.4% for the 75µg dose and 46.4% for the 225µg dose. This increases to 61.1% and 51.4% for the 
lower and higher dose, respectively, when excluding the underweight subject. The analysis of 
outcomes of mild versus moderate bleeding events underlines that for mild bleeds either dosing 
regimen was efficacious in children. For moderate bleeds however, the repeated administration of 75µg 
is clearly preferable, but the success proportion is still distinctly lower than that observed in subjects ≥
12 years of age, even if the underweight subject is excluded from the analysis. 
The mean and median number of administrations for mild/moderate bleeds was 3.6 and 3.0 for the 
75µg/kg dose, respectively. For the 225µg/kg dose, the mean and median are 2.6 and 2.0, 
respectively. In PerSept 1, for the 75 µg/kg dose a mean and median of 2.5 and 2.0 administrations 
and for the 225 µg/kg dose a mean and median of 1.4 and of 1.0 administrations were necessary until 
a successful outcome. As rapid bleed control is essential to minimise pain as well as tissue and joint 
destruction, these inferior outcomes cast doubt on a potential label in children below 12 years of age. 
The applicant was asked to discuss why, despite differences in PK parameters, the same dose and 
interval used in adults was selected for both younger age cohorts and to further investigate the 
observed differences in efficacy between the two populations studied in PerSept 1 and PerSept 2, 
especially with regard to time to good or excellent assessment, dose administered and use of other 
haemostatic agents. 
In their responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant clarified that the choice of identical dosing schedules 
in paediatric and in adult subjects was based on safety concerns, the wide range of doses of eptacog 
alfa used in children as reported in the literature and the positive review of the first 132 bleeding 
events by the data monitoring committee. This cautious approach is acknowledged. 
The applicant further argued that several factors may have substantially influenced the observed 
results and should be taken into account for the assessment of the totality of the provided data from 
PerSept 2: 
- Underweight subject was a <6-year-old child, who is likely to have been underdosed due to weight 
based dosing. The provided post hoc analysis excluding this subject shows indeed a substantially 
higher success proportion at 12 hours for both DRs (75µg 53.2% -> 67.8%; 225µg 52.9% -> 67.1%). 
This effect underlines the importance of an adequate dosing recommendation for underweight children. 
- The analysis of time to good or excellent response showed that after the 12 hours time point, most 
bleeding episodes gradually resolved (75µg and 225µg: 15 hours 84.9% and 91.1% respectively; 18 
hours 87.7% and 93.0% respectively; 21 hours are 90.5% and 94.4% respectively) until nearly all 
were successfully treated at 24 hours (75µg: 94.4%; 225µg: 95.8%). Furthermore, the applicant 
points out that for children the response to treatment is rated by the caregivers. Due to the fact that 
younger children are not able to communicate a change in symptoms as clearly as older children or 
adults, and due to caregivers likely being more cautious and applying extra doses in order to 
unequivocally stop the bleeding event, this could also lead to a longer time and more doses used until 
successful treatment is reported. This phenomenon was also reported by Gruppo et al (2013) in their 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022

publication of the Dosing Observational Study in haemophilia, which describes home treatment with 
recombinant activated factor VII in congenital haemophilia with inhibitors. 
- In addition, to highlight the relevance of the results of PerSept 2 compared to paediatric data 
generated with NovoSeven, the 4-point efficacy grading scale was transformed into the 3-point scale 
used in Croteau et al (2016). Croteau et al describe and analyse all available data for paediatric 
patients treated with NovoSeven supporting the US license. This transformation results in a percentage 
of successes at 12 hours of 98.7% for the 75µg dose and 97.4% for the 225µg dose. While it is difficult 
to compare results across different studies, this analysis illustrates the anticonservative effect of 
introducing a 3-point scale for haemostatic efficacy assessment and is accepted as supportive. 
A comparative analysis of the secondary efficacy outcomes shows the same trend as that seen for the 
primary efficacy endpoint, i.e. the younger age cohorts experience a longer time to good or excellent 
response, need more administrations and more bleeding episodes required alternative treatment. The 
trend towards a better efficacy of the 75µg/kg dosing regimen is evident throughout all reported 
outcome measures. 
The youngest participants in study PerSept 2 were 5 children 1 year of age. There are no data 
available in even younger patients and outcomes from older children would have to be extrapolated to 
this youngest age cohort in order to support a label. The population PK model indicates that in children 
below 2 years of age, Cmax is strikingly higher than in adults, and AUC is also predicted to be higher 
than in children 2-<6 years of age. The applicant has provided dosing simulations that would use a 
longer duration of infusion in children below 1 year of age in order to achieve a flattening of Cmax into 
a range comparable to that seen in adults. However, due to doubts about the accuracy of the 
population PK model, and about the reliability of available paediatric PK data in general, this proposal 
cannot be accepted. 
There were four amendments to the protocol of the PerSept2 study that were not considered to have 
an impact on the efficacy analyses. Since all study patients experienced protocol violations, the 
applicant was asked to summarise by category and comment on them. The applicant reported 76 
protocol deviations related to the study medication (74 initially recorded plus 2 additional identified 
during the treatment); none of these reported deviations are considered to have impacted the efficacy 
of Cevenfacta. There were 10 protocol deviations that were considered to potentially underestimate the 
efficacy of Cevenfacta by the applicant. A total of 30 protocol deviations were considered by the 
applicant to potentially overestimate the efficacy (11 with the 75µg/kg regimen and 19 with the 
225µg/kg regimen) of which 20 that were IMP administration after a "good/excellent” assessment; 
since the treatment was to be administered until the bleeding episode was successfully treated (i.e. 
"good/excellent” assessment) it appears unlikely this deviation could affect the efficacy of Cevenfacta. 
Concomitant medications were administered more often to patients in the 75 μg/kg regimen (91.7%) 
than to patients in the 225 μg/kg treatment (76.9%) but unlike PerSept 1 study the unbalance was 
less pronounced (11/12 patients received concomitant medications in 75 µg/kg group vs 10/13 in 225 
µg/kg group). In total FEIBA/Novoseven were administered to 6/25 (24%) patients. It is noted that 
these bypassing agents were more administered in the 225 μg/kg regimen than the 75 µg/kg regimen 
(30.8% and 16.7% respectively). More bypassing agents were administered to the patients ≥6 to <12 
of age than <6 years old, 5/12 patients (41.7%) and 1/13 patient (7.7%) respectively. The unbalance 
in use of rescue therapy among the two dose regimens and the two age groups was discussed by the 
applicant in light of the efficacy results. It is noted that the use of rescue therapy was higher with the 
75 µg/kg regimen than the 225µg/kg regimen, i.e. 4 vs 1 bleeding episodes respectively. Despite the 
higher numerical use of concomitant medications due to bleeding related events with 75 µg/kg 
compared to 225 µg/kg, the small number of cases prevents any clear conclusion on its relation to the 
efficacy of Cevenfacta. 
Assessment report

The number of bleeding episodes in children that required alternative treatment was small, one bleed 
in the 225µg/kg group in the age group <6 and 12 bleeds in the ages group 6 to <12, with 6 in each 
dosing regimen. No firm conclusions can be drawn from these sparse data. 
In the PerSept3 study, the number of performed surgeries is in line with scientific advice by the 
CHMP and fulfils the requirements outlined in the factor IX guideline. The reported minor surgery 
procedures were circumcisions and tooth extractions (3 each). The major surgeries included 
orthopaedic procedures such as two orthopaedic knee surgeries, two leg amputations, and a hip 
replacement. These surgeries can be considered as a sufficiently challenging model. 
Three patients in the minor surgery group were previously enrolled in PERSEPT 2 and 2 patients in the 
major surgery group were previously enrolled in PERSEPT 1. Since the submitted summary of clinical 
efficacy and clinical overview both mentioned that two patients in the minor surgery group previously 
participated in the PERSEPT 2 study and data from PERSEPT 2 study mentioned that two patients had 
a drug interruption to undergo a surgical procedure and were enrolled in Study PERSEPT 3, the 
applicant was asked to clarify the situation of the third patient. The applicant confirmed that the third 
patient from PerSept 3 did not participate in PerSept 2 (screen failure). 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the percentage of surgical or other invasive 
procedures with a “good” or “excellent” response to Cevenfacta treatment 48 (±4) hours after the last 
administration of Cevenfacta as assessed by the investigator. Of the 12 surgical procedures performed, 
9 (81.8%) procedures were reported by the investigator as successfully treated at the timepoint of the 
primary endpoint. Since no hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint was made, it cannot be 
concluded if the endpoint was met. 
The assessments of intraoperative efficacy by the surgeon/practitioner were either “good” or 
“excellent” for all procedures. For minor surgeries, the mean (SD) number of study drug 
administrations was 38.2 (20.98) and the mean (SD) treatment duration was 4.3 (3.71) days. For 
major surgeries, patients received mean 84.2 (40.68) administrations of Cevenfacta with a mean 
treatment duration of 17.6 (12.36) days.  
According to the provided data, there was one patient (minor surgery: tooth extraction) who 
discontinued the study due to withdrawal of consent before the final assessment. This missing 
assessment was not imputed as treatment failure for the primary analysis. The documented reason for 
withdrawal (2 days after the tooth extraction) was based on the perception of the parents that they did 
not see effect from the treatment, which means this could theoretically qualify for an AE of “lack of 
efficacy”. However, the latest efficacy assessment by the Investigator (on the same day) was “good”. 
Since there was no assessment by the Investigator at the time of withdrawal, it remains unclear 
whether this missing assessment should be imputed as failure. The applicant was asked to describe 
efficacy during PerSept3 in section 5.1 of the SmPC only in a descriptive manner, without showing 
point estimates. The data from PerSept3 is limited and stating for example an efficacy of 100% for 
minor surgeries (which is questionable as described above) would suggest more security than justified.  
One patient (knee surgery) had a moderate bleeding episode within 24 hours of the last dose of study 
drug (i.e. 7 to 8 days after surgery) and required a red blood cell transfusion and rescue treatment 
with NovoSeven, resulting in a “poor” assessment for the primary endpoint. Based on the provided 
information, it seems that treatment with Cevenfacta might have been discontinued too early. The 
applicant was asked to comment on this case and to provide more detailed information regarding the 
time of the last administration of Cevenfacta and the occurrence of the bleeding episode. The applicant 
states that one subject might have received suboptimal treatment due to his low weight (BMI  18.0-
19.0 kg/m2). This is considered as not completely unlikely, considering that in the PerSept2 trial a 
clearly reduced efficacy readout was noted in subjects with a reduced BMI. Further, the dosing interval 
was extended to every 4 hours despite a previous post operative bleeding and the persistence of the 
Assessment report

infection/inflammation markers. In addition, this patient would probably have benefited from a closer 
follow up as the evaluation at 120 h was missing and a delay of 36 h elapsed between the last 
“excellent” assessment (106 h) and the “poor” assessment at 140 h, which can be agreed with. The 
provided information underlines the importance of close follow-up during the postoperative phase. 
Upon request, the applicant included a statement in section 4.2. of the SmPC as follows: close follow-
up is important for early detection of potential postoperative bleeding events that may require 
adjustment of the dosing intervals. 
One patient underwent a right hip replacement. The day after the procedure, the patient developed a 
hematoma and the haemoglobin value decreased to 111 g/l (158 g/l at screening). These events led to 
discontinuation from the study and the imputed efficacy at the primary endpoint was rated as “poor”. 
The patient received rescue medication with FEIBA (4500 U IV three times daily). Three days after the 
surgery, the patient experienced acute haemorrhagic anaemia resulting from a gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage. He suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and died. Both the Sponsor and the DMC concluded 
that the serious events of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and acute haemorrhagic anaemia were likely 
related to postoperative administration of NSAIDs. However, the patient received paracetamol, which 
is actually not an NSAID. Paracetamol is recommended for treatment of postoperative pain in patients 
with haemophilia, according to the Comprehensive Care Guideline of the World Federation of 
haemophilia (WFH). The applicant was asked to further elucidate why the event of acute haemorrhagic 
anaemia was mainly attributed to the gastrointestinal haemorrhage, although the autopsy revealed a 
large hematoma of the right hip, but only signs of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. One should also 
consider that no NSAID was applied. In the responses, it was clarified that the latest intake of an 
NSAID was one week before the surgery, which might have affected platelet activity after surgery, 
according to the DMC. In the DMC meeting summary (03 January 2017), it is mentioned that there 
were discrepancies in the recordings made by the Investigator. The DMC expressed their concern 
about the overall management of the postoperative bleeding complication in this subject at this site 
and recommended that no new subjects be recruited at this site. Regarding the reason why acute 
haemorrhagic anaemia was mainly attributed to the gastrointestinal haemorrhage, the autopsy report 
was provided indicating that the participant lost up to 2,500 mL blood in the gastric lumen, small gut 
and colonic loops. 
The uncertainties regarding the dose recommendations for treatment of severe bleeding episodes and 
the prevention of bleedings following major surgeries were raised as a combined major objection. 
Although efficacy could be limited in these difficult clinical situations, the posology is considered closely 
related to efficacy and warrants additional justification. The proposed intervals for postoperative 
administrations following major surgeries are overall a bit wider than it is suggested for NovoSeven.  
Treatment of severe bleeding episodes: 
PK modelling data was provided, which basically shows that certain concentrations (Cmax to achieve 
probability of response of 70%) are regularly reached after administration Cevenfacta in different 
scenarios. This alone is however not sufficient to infer efficacy. For example, these concentrations (or 
even higher) were also reached in younger children (PerSept2) and a clearly reduced efficacy was 
noted compared to the older population recruited in PerSept1. 
Importantly, the population PK model is not considered reliable, which is consequently also the case for 
the results obtained from the E-R analyses. 
The clinical data obtained in PerSep1 and PerSept3 (successful treatment of 3 severe BEs and 
prevention of intraoperative bleeding during 6 major surgeries) suggests that Cevenfacta is efficacious 
in treating severe bleeding episodes in adults and probably adolescents. Due to the limited data, a 
detailed estimation of efficacy for the treatment of severe bleeding episodes cannot be made.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 111/137 
 
 
 
During PerSept1, both dosing regimen (with shorter intervals) were allowed for the treatment of 
severe BEs, in principle. Table 1 in section 4.2 of the SmPC recommends only the dosing regimen with 
the higher bolus dose (225 µg/kg). Since the 225 µg/kg regimen showed a clearly higher success rate 
for treatment of moderate bleeding events at the primary endpoint (compared to the 75 µg/kg dose), 
it may be reasonable to assume that this dose regimen could achieve a better result in treating severe 
bleeding episodes as well. It should also be mentioned that all 3 severe BEs were treated with this 
regimen and one patient was treated with a much higher dose than pre-specified in the protocol. 
Further, if one would consider the intraoperative efficacy during major surgeries as model for severe 
bleedings, it can be taken into account that the preoperative dose of 200 µg/kg is close to the 225 
µg/kg bolus.  
Overall, it can be acceptable not restricting the indication for adults and adolescents (i.e., including 
also the treatment of severe bleeding episodes). Considering all these aspects, the proposed 
recommendation to include only the regimen with the higher bolus dose in 4.2 is supported.  
However, the acceptability of including children below 12 years of age (regardless of severity of the 
bleeding episode) was questioned. Cevenfacta was not efficacious for the treatment of severe bleeding 
episodes in children below 12 years of age, as none of the three severe BEs treated resulted in 
haemostatic response at both the 12 and 24 hours after initiation of treatment. A new major objection 
was raised. With the responses to the LoOI, the applicant has decided to exclude children below 12 
years of age from the indication. 
Prevention of bleeding episodes following major surgeries:  
The applicant provided PK modelling data to justify the currently proposed dosing regimen. However, 
the population PK model and the results obtained from the E-R analyses are not considered reliable.  
The applicant cites different publications (Shapiro et al, 1998; Shapiro et al., 2012; Ertruran et al., 
2019). The paper by Ertruran et al. outlines the high proportion of bleeding complications caused by 
orthopaedic surgeries in patients with inhibitors and discusses several uncertainties related to these 
procedures and mentions the justified anxiety of those involved in the care of such patients. The 
publication by Shapiro et al. (2012) also discusses that a high percentage of haemophilia treatment 
centre staff feels uncomfortable or very uncomfortable performing non-orthopaedic (29% in total) or 
orthopaedic (49% in total) surgical procedures. The paper by Shapiro et al. from 1998 describes a 
randomised trial of two doses (35 vs. 90 µg/kg with defined intervals) of NovoSeven in haemophilia 
patients with inhibitors undergoing surgery. Of the 29 recruited subjects, intraoperative haemostasis 
was achieved in 28/29 patients, satisfactory haemostasis after the first 48 hours was reported by 
26/29 participants and 23/29 participants successfully completed the study. Of note, the higher dose 
regimen performed better, as 13/14 patients were successfully treated at the end of the study. The 
proposed dosing for Cevenfacta is closer to the high dose regimen in the study by Shapiro et al., 
although the suggested bolus dose is higher (200 µg/kg).  
Among the 6 major surgeries performed during PerSept3, intraoperative efficacy was sufficient for all 
patients. However, 2 subjects had postoperative complications. The subject who died during the 
postoperative period after a hip replacement surgery is extensively discussed in a section above. 
Another patient with major (knee) surgery reported a moderate bleeding event at the surgical site 7 
days after the procedure. The provided information suggests that this patient would probably have 
benefited from a closer follow up, as efficacy assessments were either missing or outside the protocol-
specified time points. In order to avoid that re-bleedings are detected too late, the applicant was asked 
to add an additional statement to the dosing table (Table 2) in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
The provided information underlines the importance of close follow-up during the postoperative phase. 
The applicant included a corresponding statement in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

2.5.8.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy for the treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects >12 years of age is considered as 
sufficient.  
For children <12 years of age the efficacy of Cevenfacta was not convincingly demonstrated. The 
analysis of outcomes of mild versus moderate bleeding events underlines that for mild bleeds either 
dosing regimen was efficacious in children. For moderate bleeds however, the repeated administration 
of 75µg is clearly preferable, but the success proportion is still distinctly lower than that observed in 
subjects ≥12 years of age, even if the underweight subject is excluded from the analysis. The 
influence of low bodyweight on the proportion of successfully treated bleeds is evident from the cohort 
of children <6 years of age, in which the subject had a very low bodyweight for his age and was very 
likely underdosed due to the weight-based dosing scheme. PK modelling data intended to support an 
adequate dosing regimen in underweight children, however, cannot be accepted due to doubts about 
the adequacy of the model and the reliability of paediatric PK data in general. 
The optimal dosing regimen as well as the efficacy for children below the age of 2, and especially for 
infants below 1 year of age, are still uncertain. The youngest participants in study PerSept 2 were 5 
children 1 year of age. The applicant has submitted conflicting data on the number of treated bleeding 
events in this age category. There are no data available in even younger patients and outcomes from 
older children would have to be extrapolated to this youngest age cohort in order to support a label. 
The population PK model indicates that in children below 2 years of age, Cmax is strikingly higher than 
in adults, and AUC is also predicted to be higher than in children 2-<6 years of age. The applicant has 
provided dosing simulations that would use a longer duration of infusion in children below 1 year of 
age in order to achieve a flattening of Cmax into a range comparable to that seen in adults. However, 
due to doubts about the accuracy of the population PK model and about the reliability of available 
paediatric PK data from PerSept 2 in general this proposal cannot be accepted. 
The efficacy in severe bleeding events in children below 12 years of age is not established. 
In their response to the D180 LoOI, the applicant clarified that due to the lack of additional data which 
could support the efficacy and dosing recommendations of Cevenfacta in younger children, it was 
decided to exclude the age cohort of children below 12 years of age from the indication. 
2.5.9.  Clinical safety 
2.5.9.1.  Patient exposure 
Clinical safety of Cevenfacta been evaluated in 4 clinical studies, i.e. Phase 1b (n=15), PerSept 1 
(n=27), PerSept 2 (n=25), and PerSept 3 (n=12). 
Of the 75 subjects, 15 are patients with haemophilia A without inhibitors, who participated in the phase 
1b study. The other 60 subjects are patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors (n=56) or patients with 
haemophilia B with inhibitors (n=4). 
During the assessment period, the results of a further study, LFB-FVIIA-009-19, which evaluated the 
single dose PK of Cevenfacta in 28 adult subjects suffering from haemophilia A, became available. 4 of 
the subjects had evidence of inhibitors >5 Bethesda units during the study. 
The incidence of inhibitors in haemophilia B is considerably less frequent compared to haemophilia A 
and consequently such patients are more difficult to recruit into a clinical study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 113/137 
 
 
 
13 subjects were <6 years, 15 subjects were between 6 and <12 years, 6 were between 12 and <18 
years, and 41 were >18 years of age, with an age range from 1 to 61 (1-56 in target patients with 
inhibitors). 
Four patients in PerSept 3 also participated in previous studies (2 patients in PerSept 1 and 2 in 
PerSept 2). As noted in table footnotes, these patients are counted uniquely under each treatment 
regimen column in both PerSept 3 and their respective former studies; however, the Overall numbers 
(N=75) count each patient only once. 
Across all studies, 3418 infusions of Cevenfacta were administered (676 with Cevenfacta Process A, 
2627 with Cevenfacta Process B and 115 with both manufacturing Processes), representing 1117 
treatment episodes with a mean (SD) number of treatment episodes per patient of 14.9 (16.60). 
A treatment episode was defined as any one of the following: 
1. Single Cevenfacta administration in Phase 1b or Phase A of PerSept 1 and PerSept 2; 
2. Single Cevenfacta administration for purpose of pharmacokinetics (PK) in Phase B of PerSept 1; 
3. All Cevenfacta administrations from just prior to the surgical incision or invasive procedure through 
the end date/time of the surgery/procedure in PerSept 3; or 
4. All Cevenfacta administrations for purposes of treating a given bleeding episode in Phase B of 
PerSept 1 and PerSept 2, or after the end date/time of surgery/procedure in PerSept 3. 
The mean (SD) total amount of Cevenfacta administered was 4584.0 (5186.37) μg/kg. The mean (SD) 
number of infusions per patient was 45.6 (54.51) and the total duration of treatment was 12.8 (11.65) 
days.  
The median duration of treatment was 1 day for each dose in Phase 1b, each with a minimum and 
maximum of 1 day. In the pooled results from PerSept 1 and 2, the median duration was 5.1 days 
(75μg/kg) and 6.6 days (225 μg/kg), and ranged from a minimum of 0 days to a maximum of 17 days 
in the 75 μg/kg dose group, and from 1 to 30 days in the 225 μg/kg dose group.  
In PerSept 3, the median duration of treatment was 7.2 days for those receiving 75 μg/kg and 1.0 day 
for those receiving the loading dose of 200 μg/kg on the day of their surgical or invasive procedure, as 
would be expected per protocol. The minimum number of days treated for those receiving 75 μg/kg 
was 1 day, with a maximum of 32 days. Duration of treatment for all those who received 200 μg/kg 
loading dose was 1 day. 
2.5.9.2.  Adverse events 
The clinical studies of Cevenfacta defined several categories of AEs. An AE was considered a treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it occurred or worsened after the first dose of study drug. Non-
TEAEs were AEs that occurred after signing the informed consent but before the first study drug 
administration. An AE was considered treatment-related if it had a definite, probable, or possible 
relationship to the study treatment, or if the relationship to study treatment was missing. 
In addition, the Phase 1b, PerSept 1, and PerSept 2 studies analysed “treatment-associated” adverse 
events (TAAEs). The purpose of defining TAAEs was to capture all AEs within a defined time period 
relative to dosing, whether or not the AEs were considered to be treatment-related. More precisely, in 
Phase 1b, the time window for TAAE definition was 36 hours post infusion. In PerSept 1 and PerSept 2, 
an AE was considered to be TAAEs if it occurred between the start of treatment of a bleeding episode 
and the end of treatment of the bleeding episode, up to and including 24 hours after the last 
administration of study drug for that bleeding episode, or if it occurred within 24 hours after study 
Assessment report

Page 114/137 
 
 
 
drug administration for PK purposes. In PerSept 3, TAAEs were not defined or measured separately in 
the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. 
In the Cevenfacta programme, a number of prospective AEs were identified as adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs) based on the haemophilia population, and/or experience with coagulation 
factors, and/or because Cevenfacta belongs to a group of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins. 
These were thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, and immunogenicity or 
antidrug antibodies (ADAs). 
The definitions of treatment-emergent and treatment-associated adverse events as well as the 
selection of adverse events of special interest are endorsed. 
The most frequent TEAEs by SOCs reported in at least 10% of patients were: 
- Infections and infestations in 25.3% of patients (mostly from PerSept 2), the most frequent TEAEs 
were nasopharyngitis in 7 (9.3%) patients, bronchitis and rhinitis in 4 (5.3%) patients, and respiratory 
tract infection viral and tonsillitis in 2 (2.7%) patients each. 
- Injury, poisoning and procedural complications in 11 (14.7%) patients, the most frequent TEAEs 
were procedural pain in 5 (6.7%) patients, wound secretion in 3 (4.0%) patients and anaemia 
postoperative in 2 (2.7%) patients. 
- Nervous system disorders in 11 (14.7%) patients, the most frequent TEAEs were headache in 6 
(8.0%) patients and dizziness in 2 (2.7%) patients. 
- Gastrointestinal disorders in 10 (13.3%) patients, the most frequent TEAEs were vomiting and 
diarrhoea in 3 (4.0%) patients each and nausea in 2 (2.7%) patients. 
- Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders in 8 patients (10.7%), the most frequent TEAEs were 
cough in 4 (5.3%) patients and oropharyngeal pain in 2 (2.7%) patients. 
No specific pattern is discernible from the analysis of TEAEs by SOCs. The distribution of TEAEs by SOC 
was consistent with the patients’ age in each study and the clinical setting in which the product was 
used. Infections and infestations and gastrointestinal disorders were mostly reported in the paediatric 
patients in PerSept 2 while injury, poisoning and procedural complications were more frequent in 
PerSept 3. Nervous system disorders were mainly from Phase 1b.

172 treatment emergent adverse events were observed during the phase 1b study and PerSept 1,2 
and 3. Many AEs were infections like nasopharyngits or diarrhoea, which are prevalent in children, or 
commonly occurring events, like headache. Only a minority of TEAE were assessed as related, which 
can be agreed. Most of these events represented local or systemic infusion reactions, and were graded 
as mild.

μg/kg  of  Cevenfacta,  a  mild  headache  lasting  approximately  2  hours  and  from  which  he  recovered. 
Additionally, one patient experienced, during drug infusion, symptoms including tachycardia, flushing, 
tremor,  dysgeusia,  chest  discomfort  which  were  assessed  as  unrelated  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator.  Upon  review  of  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  and  temporal  association,  the  Sponsor 
considered that this patient may have developed “infusion related reaction” to Cevenfacta. 
PerSept 1: 1 patient experiencing 6 drug-related TEAEs at 75 μg/kg including 4 events of infusion site 
discomfort and 2 events of infusion site haematoma, all occurred during 4 bleeding episodes and all were 
mild in severity. 1 child of 12 years old experiencing 1 increased body temperature 4 hours after receiving 
225 μg/kg Cevenfacta which was moderate in severity and resolved 2 days later. 
PerSept  3:  One  patient  who  underwent  major  hip  replacement  surgery,  experienced  3  drug-related 
TEAEs  all  severe  in  nature  (post  procedural  haematoma,  serious  blood  loss  anaemia,  and  serious 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage).  
LFB-FVIIA-009-19: 1 TEAE (mild headache in one subject) was assessed to be related to Cevenfacta and

SAEs 
Of the 75 treated patients, 4 (5.3%) experienced a total of 7 SAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 117/137 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the SAEs leading to death for one patient in PerSept 3, 3 other patients treated with 
Cevenfacta experienced 4 treatment-emergent nonfatal SAEs while on study: 1 patient in PerSept 1 
and 2 patients in PerSept 2. These SAEs are summarised briefly below and all were classified as 
unrelated to treatment with Cevenfacta.  
Phase 1b 
In the Phase 1b study, no patient experienced an SAE. 
PerSept 1 
In PerSept 1, one patient in the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen experienced 2 treatment-emergent 
nonfatal SAEs (acute tonsillitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage). The Investigator considered these 
SAEs to be unrelated to treatment with Cevenfacta.  
PerSept 2 
Two patients (8.3%, both in the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen) in PerSept 2 each experienced 1 
treatment-emergent nonfatal SAE. One patient was in the birth to <6-year-old age group and 1 patient 
was in the ≥6 to <12-year-old age group. 
The <2-year-old patient was diagnosed with dysentery that was moderate in severity and was 
classified as an SAE by the Investigator because it was a medically important event (acute infection). 
The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin. Another <12-year-old patient experienced paresis due to an 
intracranial bleed that was severe and classified as an SAE by the Investigator, due to prolonged 
hospitalisation. 
PerSept 3 
In PerSept 3, one patient experienced 3 TRTEAEs (post procedural hematoma, haemorrhagic anaemia 
(recoded as blood loss anaemia (MedDRA v.23.0), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage). The blood loss 
anaemia and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were considered by the Investigator to be SAEs. These 
events were initially reported as unlikely related and were subsequently updated to be probably related 
to Cevenfacta by the Investigator. The independent DMC reviewed the SAEs and was not in agreement 
with the Investigator’s subsequent assessment. The DMC reviewed the medical management records 
and assessed the 2 SAEs as unlikely related to Cevenfacta. Concurrent Sponsor review reached a 
similar conclusion to the DMC. The patient died due to blood loss anaemia. See Section Deaths below 
for a complete narrative of this patient. 
No other patient in PerSept 3 experienced an SAE. 
LFB-FVIIA-009-19 
No subject in this single dose study experienced an SAE. 
The 5 SAEs reported from studies PerSept 1 and 2 are either infections or bleeding events and their 
sequelae. It is agreed with the assessment of the investigator that these SAEs can be classified as 
unrelated to Cevenfacta. 
From the review of the narrative of the one patient experiencing SAEs in PerSept 3, however, the 
initially diagnosed blood loss anaemia appears to be due to the postoperative haematoma. A decrease 
in haemoglobin from 158g/L to 111g/L at 24 hours after surgery and before withdrawal of Cevenfacta 
was observed. Therefore, even if the final lethal event, i.e. the gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
happened during treatment with FEIBA, the initial blood loss anaemia can be attributed to lack of effect 
of Cevenfacta. According to the WHO classification of anaemia severity, a haemoglobin value of 111g/L 
is classified as mild anaemia, therefore not fulfilling the SAE definition. However, this event can be 
considered as a related treatment-associated adverse event. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 118/137 
 
 
 
The two SAEs of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and blood loss anaemia happened shortly after 
withdrawal of Cevenfacta and initiation of treatment with FEIBA.  
Deaths 
Of the 75 patients treated with Cevenfacta in clinical studies, 1 patient in PerSept 3 died following 
discontinuation of treatment with Cevenfacta. This patient had successfully completed PerSept 1 before 
enrolling in PerSept 3. 
The patient was diagnosed with severe haemophilia A in the late 1950s. In the PerSept 1 study, this 
patient experienced 25 mild or moderate bleeding episodes between his first dose (Mid Q4 2014) and 
early Q3 2015. The first 10 episodes were treated in the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen, the next 6 in 
the 75 μg/kg treatment regimen, and the final 9 in the 225 μg/kg treatment regimen. All but 1 of the 
bleeding episodes were spontaneous. Patient reported efficacy 12 hours after initial Cevenfacta 
administration was “excellent” for the first 2 episodes, and “good” for all 23 of the subsequent 
episodes. No bleeding episode recurred, required a hospital visit, or required alternative treatment. 
The patient did not experience any TEAE during the PerSept 1 study. He completed his participation in 
PerSept 1 in early Q3 2015. 
The patient was enrolled in PerSept 3 in early Q4 2016, underwent venous catheter placement 2 days 
after, and received his first dose of Cevenfacta (200 μg/kg loading dose, per protocol) ,another 8 days 
later (D0), the same day he underwent the major surgical procedure of right hip replacement. His 
initial Cevenfacta dose was followed by 75 μg/kg doses every 2 hours from D0 to D1 , as allowed by 
protocol. There were no surgical complications, and the surgeon’s intraoperative efficacy assessment 
was “excellent.” At 24 hours after surgery completion, efficacy was assessed as “good.” 
Post procedural hematoma formation was observed on D1, despite infusions of Cevenfacta. The 
patient’s haemoglobin was normal at screening (158 g/L), prior to the surgery; 24 hours post 
procedure it had decreased to 111 g/L, which was considered abnormal and clinically significant. The 
increased hematoma was assessed by the Investigator as Cevenfacta inefficacy. Cevenfacta was 
withdrawn and the patient was discontinued from the study due to the post procedural hematoma. The 
patient received rescue treatment with FEIBA following his early termination visit. 
On D3, the patient experienced acute post haemorrhagic anaemia (MedDRA v.23.0 PT blood loss 
anaemia) resulting from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which complicated his haemophilia A (note 
that gastrointestinal bleeding was not in the medical history for this patient). He suffered 
cardiopulmonary arrest and died that same day. The autopsy outcome was massive gastrointestinal 
blood loss. 
These SAEs (blood loss anaemia; gastrointestinal haemorrhage) were initially reported as unlikely 
related and were subsequently updated to be probably related to Cevenfacta by the Investigator. The 
independent DMC reviewed the SAEs and was not in agreement with the Investigator’s subsequent 
assessment. The DMC reviewed the medical management records and assessed the 2 SAEs as unlikely 
related to Cevenfacta. Concurrent Sponsor review reached a similar conclusion to the DMC. The patient 
died due to blood loss anaemia. 
2.5.9.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Most haematology laboratory parameters evaluated during the clinical studies of Cevenfacta showed no 
apparent trends or clinically significant changes, other than those expected based on the 
pharmacologic action of the study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 119/137 
 
 
 
Clinical Chemistry 
Most clinical chemistry laboratory parameters evaluated during the clinical studies of Cevenfacta 
showed no apparent trends or clinically significant changes, other than those expected based on the 
pharmacologic action of the study drug. Based on grade 3 threshold of CTCAE v.5.0, some markedly 
abnormal values were recorded for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
sodium and total serum calcium in the Phase 3 studies. 
The patient showing abnormally high ALT and AST values suffered from hepatitis C and had elevated 
levels already at baseline, which peaked at week 12 and then decreased without intervention. 
The applicant was asked to provide more information on the two paediatric patients who experienced 
very low calcium levels. In their response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant summarised the current 
knowledge on the association of hypocalcaemia and coagulopathy. At the time being it is not 
established if the hypocalcaemia represents a sequel of a trauma or bleeding event or if a pre-existing 
hypocalcaemia worsens the extent of bleeding. 
It can be assumed that clinicians will monitor laboratory parameters in those patients who undergo 
major surgery or experience a major bleeding event as a matter of course. 
Coagulation 
Coagulation parameters showed no apparent trends or clinically significant changes, other than those 
expected in haemophilia patients and based on the pharmacologic action of the study drug. 
2.5.9.5.  Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analysis by age at enrolment 
Of the 75 patients included, 28 were children, 6 were adolescents and 41 were adults. Although 
inclusion was permitted for patients aged up to 75 years, no patient older than 65 years was enrolled 
in any study of Cevenfacta. 
The overall frequency of TEAEs was quite similar between age groups with a slight trend toward more 
TEAEs in children aged from 6 to less than 12 years. The proportion of patients reporting TEAE was 
61.5% in patient aged less than 6 years (0.045 TEAEs per infusion), 80% in patients aged from 6 to 
less than 12 years (0.038 TEAEs per infusion), 66.7% in adolescents (0.054 TEAEs per infusion) and 
63.4% in adults (0.064 TEAEs per infusion). 
The age range of all enrolled patients was 1 to 61 years (1-56 years in target patients with inhibitors). 
The safety of Cevenfacta administration in elderly subjects has not been investigated. Due to 
concurrent risk factors, the incidence of thromboembolic events in these patients is likely to be higher. 
Subgroup analysis by BMI 
Of the 75 treated patients included, 32 were classified as underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) but most of 
them were children or adolescents and only 2 patients were adults (in PerSept 3), 27 patients had 
normal weight (18.5 kg/m2 to <25 kg/m2), 13 patients were overweight (25 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) 
and 4 patients were obese (≥30 kg/m2). 
Despite the differences observed in the incidence and the nature of TEAEs between the different 
groups of BMI, the pattern of TEAEs remained consistent with the patients age in each category of BMI 
and with the clinical setting in which the drug product was used. 
Subgroup analysis by disease history 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 120/137 
 
 
 
The incidence of TRTEAEs (patient level) was comparable in the categories of the subgroups type of 
haemophilia (Type A, Type B) or severity (moderate, severe), FVIII/FIX level (< Median [0.5%], ≥ 
Median [0.5%]), or level of inhibitor (BU <5, BU ≥5). No TRTEAE was reported in more than 1 patient 
in any category of these subgroups. 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
Eptacog beta (activated) was evaluated only in male patients. Also, there are no available data on use 
of  eptacog  beta  (activated)  in  pregnant  women.  No  information  on  labor,  delivery,  or  the  effects  of 
eptacog beta (activated) on nursing mothers or breast-fed infants is available to-date.  
2.5.9.6.  Immunological events 
Screening and confirmatory assays were setup based on common antibody-bridging- assay protocols. 
Method validation reports for the assessment of immunogenicity including drug-interference studies 
were provided and confirm that the applied protocols were suitable for the intended use, and aligned 
with respective EMA guideline on immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins in force at the 
time-point when the study was performed.  
Immunogenicity against Cevenfacta was low, with only two transiently positive ADA samples in the 
entire study programme. A single positive test against colloidal rabbit milk protein in one subject in 
PerSept 2 could not be replicated and is most likely a false positive. 
No hypersensitivity events were reported in any of the four clinical studies. 
2.5.9.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The increased risk of thromboembolic events with concomitant use of aPCC/PCC is expected for 
Cevenfacta. 
2.5.9.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The only case that involved an AE leading to discontinuation in any clinical study with Cevenfacta was 
that for one patient in PerSept 3, who discontinued from Cevenfacta treatment due to post procedural 
haematoma and subsequently withdrew from the study due to blood loss anaemia. The patient later 
died. The cause of death was blood loss anaemia secondary to gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The post 
procedural haematoma was considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to treatment with 
Cevenfacta. Further details are provided in under the heading of SAE. 
2.5.9.9.  Post marketing experience 
Cevenfacta was approved in the United States of America on 01 April 2020. At the time of the initial 
marketing authorisation application submission, Cevenfacta has not been launched in this territory, 
and therefore, no patients have been exposed to this medicinal product. 
Available data for the US market include 16 users and 2 subjects have enrolled in a PASS. No AEs were 
reported.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety of Cevenfacta has been investigated in four clinical trials which enrolled 75 patients 
(4 patients enrolled in two studies, PerSept 3 and PerSept 1 or PerSept 2, respectively). The 15 
subjects of the phase 1b study were patients with haemophilia A without inhibitors. In the phase 3 
studies, 56 subjects were patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors, and 4 subjects suffered from 
haemophilia B with inhibitors. 13 subjects were <6 years, 15 subjects were between 6 and <12 years, 
6 were between 12 and <18 years, and 41 were >18 years of age, with an age range from 1 to 61 (1-
56 in target patients with inhibitors). Additionally, a single dose PK trial in 28 subjects suffering from 
haemophilia A, of whom 4 subjects displayed evidence of a high titre inhibitor against FVIII, was 
submitted during the review process. 
The  overall  demographics,  disease  characteristics,  concomitant  diseases  and  medications  were 
consistent with those of the general population of patients with haemophilia and inhibitors. The BMI and 
BSA were generally typical for the age ranges enrolled.  
As usually observed in such patients, the most frequent medical histories (61.3% of the patients) were 
from the system organ class (SOC) “Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders”. The majority of 
patients (81.3%) were taking medication to treat bleedings, and as expected, the most frequent were 
analgesics (42.7% of the patients) and blood and coagulation factors (in 34.7% of patients). 
The overall profile particularly regarding concomitant medication used in the course of the clinical studies 
is  considered  consistent  with  respective  study  population  and  does  not  indicate  any  additional  safety 
concerns.  
The main exclusion criteria in all 4 trials were immunosuppression, having a platelet count 
<100,000/ml, a known allergy or hypersensitivity to rabbits, or a history of thromboembolic events. 
The latter two conditions are adequately reflected in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
The presented safety database is small, but this is owed to the fact that patients with haemophilia and 
inhibitors are rare, especially those who suffer from haemophilia B. Therefore, the very low number of 
patients with haemophilia B with inhibitors and the low numbers of patients with haemophilia A with 
inhibitors can be accepted as post-marketing safety follow-up via EUHASS and PEDNET registry is 
planned (please see RMP section). 
During the clinical trials, 172 adverse events were captured, of which less than 10% (n=13) were 
assessed as related. Many of the TEAE were infections like nasopharyngitis or diarrhoea, which are 
prevalent in children, or commonly occurring events, like headache. Most of the events assessed as 
related represented local or systemic infusion reactions, and were graded as mild. In single dose PK 
study LFB-FVIIA-009-19, one instance of mild headache was assessed as treatment related. 
The following AEs were identified as adverse events of special interest (AESIs): thromboembolic 
events, hypersensitivity reactions, and immunogenicity or antidrug antibodies (ADAs). No AESIs were 
reported in any of the four clinical studies. 
Of the 7 serious adverse events, 5 SAEs were reported from studies PerSept 1 and 2 are either 
infections or spontaneous or traumatic bleeding events and their sequelae. It is agreed with the 
assessment of the investigator that these SAEs can be classified as unrelated to Cevenfacta. 
The two SAEs of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and blood loss anaemia leading to death of one patient 
in PerSept 3 happened shortly after withdrawal of Cevenfacta and initiation of treatment with FEIBA. 
However, an assessment of the relatedness of these events to the treatment with Cevenfacta is 
difficult and the applicant was asked to provide more insights into this event. The applicant provided 
the autopsy report and the DMC meeting minutes concerning this event. In the DMC meeting summary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 122/137 
 
 
 
(03 January 2017), it is mentioned that there were discrepancies in the recordings made by the 
Investigator. The DMC expressed their concern about the overall management of the postoperative 
bleeding complication in this subject at this site and recommended that no new subjects be recruited 
at this site. In summary, despite persistent bleeding at the surgical site, no revision of the wound was 
performed in order to identify and manage bleeders. The gastrointestinal bleed started approximately 
two days after initiation of FEIBA, therefore a direct relationship is unlikely. 
Evaluations of safety laboratory parameters and immunogenicity data did not reveal worrying signals. 
In two paediatric subjects low calcium levels were observed. The applicant provided the current 
knowledge on the association of hypocalcaemia and coagulopathy. At the time being it is not 
established if the hypocalcaemia represents a sequel of a trauma or bleeding event or if a pre-existing 
hypocalcaemia worsens the extent of bleeding. Therefore, no further helpful recommendation can be 
made in the SmPC, especially as it can be assumed that clinicians will monitor laboratory parameters in 
those patients who undergo major surgery or experience a major bleeding event as a matter of course. 
Due to weight-based dosing, an increased or decreased dose of Cevenfacta despite a similar 
intravascular compartment is administered in patients with the same height but differing weight, which 
could lead to either lack of efficacy or safety consequences. The applicant was therefore asked to 
discuss if a minimum dose for underweight and a maximum dose for overweight patients should be 
specified or if at least a statement alerting the treating physician that dose based on bodyweight may 
require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients is warranted in the SmPC. During the 
evaluation, the applicant provided evaluation of efficacy and estimated PK parameters in the three 
bodyweight categories. There was a trend towards lack of efficacy in underweight children <12 years 
of age, while estimated exposure in overweight patients was comparable to that in normal weight 
subjects. It is acknowledged that the current PK model is not optimal, but additional reassurance 
towards comparable safety is provided by the 284 treated bleeding episodes in overweight subjects in 
studies PerSept 1 and 2. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety profile of Cevenfacta as demonstrated in its clinical trial programme is considered 
manageable, and able to support the granting of a marketing authorisation.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication sought is treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those 
patients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures, in children and adults congenital haemophilia A or 
B patients with: 
• 
• 
High-response inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX (i.e. ≥5 Bethesda Units (BU)), including 
those expected to have a high anamnestic response to factor VIII or factor IX administration. 
Low-response inhibitors (BU<5) but expected to be refractory to increased dosing of FVIII or FIX. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 127/137 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for treatment of bleeds or prevention of bleeding in those undergoing 
surgery in haemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors is treatment with bypassing agents. The two 
products available for this are: 
• 
• 
recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven) and 
activated  prothrombin  complex  concentrate  (aPCC,  or  factor  eight  inhibitors  bypassing  agent 
[FEIBA]). 
For patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors, emicizumab (Hemlibra) is an option for prophylaxis of 
bleeding episodes. Emicizumab is a humanised bispecific monoclonal antibody that bridges activated 
FIX and FX to mimic the function of activated FVIII, thereby increasing thrombin formation. Such an 
option is not available for patients with haemophilia B with inhibitors.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A total of four clinical studies were submitted to support the MAA of Cevenfacta. There was a Phase 1b 
Study in patients with haemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors assessing the safety and PK/PD of 
Cevenfacta. The three efficacy trials (PerSept1-3) enrolled haemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors. 
Study GTC-FVIIa-005-11: Phase 1b, dose-escalation, multicentre, open-label, multinational study 
assessing safety, PK, PD of Cevenfacta in adult patients with congenital haemophilia A or B in a non-
bleeding state. 15 patients were enrolled. 
LFB-FVIIA-009-19: Phase I, open-label, randomised, parallel, single-dose PK study in subjects with 
haemophilia A, with or without inhibitors to FVIII. PK and safety of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 75 
or 225 μg/kg of the commercial manufacturing process were evaluated in 28 male subjects aged 18 to 
75 years, inclusive, with confirmed diagnosis of haemophilia A (with or without inhibitors to FVIII) and 
who were not experiencing an active bleeding episode. 
PerSept1: Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, crossover study of two treatment regimens 
for bleeding episodes (patients ≥12 years of age); The trial consisted of two phases: Phase A: PK and 
safety; Phase B: treatment of bleeding episodes, repeated PK for product of the commercial 
manufacturing process. 27 patients were enrolled. 
PerSept2: Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, crossover study of two treatment regimens 
for bleeding episodes (patients <12 years of age); the trial consisted of two phases: Phase A: PK and 
safety; Phase B: treatment of bleeding episodes. 25 patients were enrolled. 
PerSept3: Phase 3, multicentre, single-arm, open-label, study in surgical/invasive procedures; ≥12 
procedures in ≥6 patients; ≥6 major procedures (patients aged ≥6 months to ≤75 years). 12 patients 
were enrolled (4 patients participated in earlier trials (2 from PerSept1 and 2 from PerSept2) and were 
counted uniquely).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From a quality point of view a robust and well-controlled drug substance and drug product 
manufacturing has been set-up. An appropriate overall control strategy is in place which assures that 
only material fulfilling its predefined quality expectations will enter the market. This conclusion is 
further supported by conducted process validation results and a considerable amount of batch data 
from GMP batches manufactured during development. An extensive characterisation of product and its 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 128/137 
 
 
 
manufacturing process has been performed and indicates that the applicant has gained an in-depth 
knowledge of its process and product. 
The phase 3 trial PerSept1 includes data from treatment of 468 bleeding episodes (465 
mild/moderate, 3 severe) in 27 subjects above the age of 12 years. The proportion of successfully 
treated bleeding episodes was higher for the 225 µg/kg dose regimen (89.8%), compared to the 75 
µg/kg regimen (80.2%).  
In terms of time to assessment of a successful response (= ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ assessment) there was 
a clear difference between the two treatment regimens, with a median of 3 hours for the 225 µg/kg 
group and 6 hours for the 75 µg/kg group.  
Less study drug administrations were necessary for the 225 µg/kg group (mean 1.4, median 1.0 
administrations) compared to the 75 µg/kg group (mean 2.5, median 2.0 administrations). For 
patients on the 225 μg/kg regimen, approximately 85% were successfully treated with a single 
administration of 225 μg/kg Cevenfacta. 
The higher bolus infusion of 225 µg/kg resulted in a higher total amount of study drug administered 
per bleeding episode (mean 252.96 µg/kg, median 225.09 µg/kg), compared to the lower dose bolus 
infusion of 75 µg/kg (mean 187.87 µg/kg, median 149.68 µg/kg) for the treatment of mild/moderate 
bleeding events. 
In study PerSept2, 549 treated bleeding events (546 mild/moderate, 3 severe) occurred in 25 
subjects <12 years of age. Of these bleeds, 66.1% of bleeding events treated with the 75µg/kg dose 
(n=239) were successfully treated at 12 hours, as well as 61.3% of bleeds treated with the 
225µg/kg dose (n= 310). For the <6-year-old subjects, these values are 56.6% and 58.5% for 
75µg/kg and 225µg/kg, respectively. For the 6 to <12-year-old patients, the proportions are 73.7% 
and 63.8% for the two different dosing schemes.  
The median time to assessment of a good or excellent response was 9 hours for the 75µg/kg dose 
and 12 hours for the 225µg/kg dose. As for the lower dose, a repeat administration was allowed 
every 3 hours, this signifies the need for 3 doses of 75µg/kg (at 0, 3 and 6 hours) until success. For 
the higher dose, the initial treatment of 225µg/kg could be followed with a 75µg/kg dose at 9 hours, 
and the outcome of this endpoint signifies that the initial higher dose and at least one additional dose 
are needed for resolution of the bleed.  
The mean and median number of administrations for mild/moderate bleeds was 3.6 and 3 for the 
75µg/kg dose, and 2.6 and 2 for the 225µg/kg dose, respectively.  
The PerSept3 trial provides data from 12 surgical procedures, including 6 major (2x leg amputation, 
2x knee surgery, 1x hip surgery, 1x achilloplasty) and 6 minor (3x circumcision, 3x tooth extraction) 
surgeries in patients between the age of 2 to 56 years.  
The intraoperative assessment by the surgeon/practitioner was “good” or “excellent” for all 12 
procedures. This assessment was based on the blood volume loss, the amount of fluid replacement 
given, transfusion requirements, and hemodynamic stability. However, of the 12 surgical procedures 
performed, 9 (81.8%) procedures were reported by the investigator as successfully treated 
(“good” or “excellent” response) with Cevenfacta at 48 hours after the last administration (=primary 
endpoint) of Cevenfacta, 2 (18.2%) were treatment failures (“poor” response), and 1 assessment was 
missing because of discontinuation from the study (withdrawal of consent) prior to the assessment at 
48 hours.  
For minor surgeries, the mean (SD) number of study drug administrations was 38.2 (20.98) and the 
mean (SD) treatment duration was 4.3 (3.71) days. For major surgeries, patients received mean 84.2 
(40.68) administrations of Cevenfacta with a mean treatment duration of 17.6 (12.36) days.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The applicant provided further clinical PK data from a new clinical study FVIIa-009-19 based on 
activated FVII plasma concentrations, analysed using a different PK assay. An indirect comparison of 
the NCA results obtained by the two different methods in two different studies (method GBS 2013-30 
for Phase 3 studies versus method AI-01587 for the new Study 009-19) was attempted to assess the 
degree of comparability / similarity of PK data using the same to-be marketed Process B and same 
doses. Overall, these data did not give reassurance on the comparability of PK data collected with the 
two analytical methods and ultimately reinforce doubts regarding the reliability of the analytical 
method used in Phase 3 studies. Conclusively, PK data collected in these two studies were excluded 
from the PK package and only data from the new clinical study FVIIa-009-19 were considered for PK 
characterisation purpose of the of Cevenfacta product.  
In the phase III trial differences in clinical performance characteristics have been observed between 
product generated with process version A and B. Regarding quality, a number of deficiencies in the 
conduct of the comparability exercise have been noted in the initial dossier. These deficiencies left a 
considerably high level of uncertainty on the quality comparability claim of Process A with Process B 
(intended commercial process) material open. To address these deficiencies the applicant:  
#) conducted an additional comparative in-depth characterisation of clinical/GMP/process validation 
material manufactured with both process versions,  
#) provided acceptable clarifications on establishment of comparability criteria, 
#) and included the whole available batch release data set from both process versions to re-evaluate 
comparability. 
In summary, the new data provided with the responses support the comparability claim.  
During the PerSept1 trial, a new manufacturing product was introduced (upscaled process B). The 
above presented efficacy results are compromised by the fact that only a relatively small fraction of 
patients received product of the commercial process B. Of the 468 bleeding episodes in PerSept1, only 
86/468 (18.4%) were treated with product from process B and 53/468 (11.3%) with a mixture of 
products from both processes.  
For the 75 µg/kg regimen, the proportion of successfully treated bleeding events was similar between 
both processes (process A: 82.3%, process B: 80.4%). The success proportion was lower for process B 
with the 225 µg/kg regimen (process A: 91.2%, process B: 80.0%). However, the comparability of 
efficacy results between the processes is limited due to the much lower number of bleedings treated 
with process B. Initial major concerns regarding the comparability have been resolved (please see 
clinical discussion).  
In study PerSept 2, a clear difference in the proportion of successfully treated bleeding events to the 
outcomes of PerSept 1, where patients aged 12 and above were investigated, is evident (66.1% vs. 
80.2% for the 75µg/kg dose and 61.3% vs. 89.8% for the 225µg/kg dose). 
Despite the fact that a faster clearance of Cevenfacta was determined in paediatric subjects, the same 
dose and interval as in adults was used for children in both age cohorts. A trend towards better 
treatment outcomes was observed in the 6 to <12 cohort, supporting the notion that the selected dose 
and /or dosing interval should have been adapted for children.  
The analysis of the primary endpoint according to BMI subgroups shows increasing efficacy with 
increasing BMI. Due to weight-based dosing, an increased dose of Cevenfacta despite a similar 
intravascular compartment is administered in patients with the same height but higher weight and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 130/137 
 
 
 
leads to better outcomes in those subjects and could conversely cause a lack of efficacy in underweight 
subjects. 
The median time to assessment of a good or excellent response was 9 hours for the 75µg/kg dose and 
12 hours for the 225µg/kg dose. However, compared to outcomes from PerSept 1, where a median of 
3 hours for the 225 µg/kg group and 6 hours for the 75 µg/kg group passed until a good/ excellent 
response was reported, these values emphasise the inferior bleed control in younger children 
compared to adolescents and adults. It can however not be excluded that these outcomes might be 
influenced by the assessment of bleeding response being done by the parent or caregiver for paediatric 
subjects  
In an analysis of outcomes of mild versus moderate bleeding events, the success proportion of mild 
bleeding events is clearly in favour of treatment with eptacog beta at both the 75µg and the 225µg 
dose, the success proportion for moderate bleeding events is only 55.4% for the 75µg dose and 46.4% 
for the 225µg dose.  
The efficacy in severe bleeding events in children below 12 years of age is not established due to only 
three severe bleeds being treated in study PerSept 2, of which none were a success. Further 
uncertainties concern the optimal dose for children below 2 years of age and especially for infants <1, 
for whom no data are available. No reliable population PK model was available to provide support for 
dosing recommendations in any of the above-mentioned issues. 
In their response to the D180 LoOI, the applicant has clarified that children below 12 years of age will 
be excluded from the indication, as there are no further data available to support dosing 
recommendations and efficacy in this age group. 
Some methodological concerns for both PerSept1 and 2 regarding the primary efficacy estimand 
were raised, particularly specifying how the intercurrent events withdrawal from assigned treatment 
and initiation of alternative/rescue therapy are to be addressed.  
Not all methodological issues were resolved in the end. For example, for people who are withdrawn 
from treatment with the study drug, the remaining bleeding episodes (after withdrawal) should be 
documented and included as failure in the efficacy assessment. The responses by the applicant could 
also not clarify whether ALL bleeding events during the whole study period have been treated with 
Cevenfacta or whether some of the events were treated with alternative treatments (without 
documentation). The difficulty of evaluating events that were not reported is acknowledged, but the 
concern arises whether or not the reporting of bleeding events is independent of the perceived efficacy 
of their treatment. An introduction of bias cannot be ruled out, especially because most patients were 
treated at home. The estimate of the rate of treatment failure in the population of bleeds that were 
reported could not be representative of the overall rate of failure. The applicant has also not provided 
adequate reasoning for the value of the OPC from a clinical or methodological perspective. However, 
these issues were not further pursued since the main aspects of the study design have been agreed 
with during several previous EMA-SA procedures. The efficacy table in section 5.1 of the SmPC was 
updated, showing the primary efficacy results based on an analysis where bleeding episodes with 
missing assessments are considered as failures.  
Further, a planned interim analysis to potentially re-assess the study’s sample size raised several 
concerns. The number of reported bleeding events by far exceeded the pre-specified numbers. 
Therefore, the applicant was asked to explain the overrun and the decision making regarding the 
interim analysis. Further a primary efficacy analysis including only the first 352 bleeding events, as 
initially planned in the original protocol, was requested. In their responses, the applicant provided 
background information from the DMC meetings. The explanation of the overrun was sufficiently 
convincing for both trials (PerSept1 and PerSept2, see discussion section). For PerSept1, a sensitivity 
Assessment report

Page 131/137 
 
 
 
analysis after 352 bleeding events shows very similar point estimates and confidence intervals 
compared to the primary endpoint. No such sensitivity analysis was provided for PerSept2, since the 
applicant decided to exclude the respective population from the label, which is acceptable. 
The open-label and uncontrolled study design and limited size of PerSept 1 (N = 27), PerSept 2 (N = 
25) and PerSept 3 (N = 12) make any interpretation of efficacy results challenging. 
There were 2 treatment failures in the PerSept3 surgery study. One patient (knee surgery) had a 
moderate bleeding episode within 24 hours of the last dose of study drug (i.e. 7 to 8 days after 
surgery) and required a red blood cell transfusion and rescue treatment with NovoSeven. The second 
treatment failure for a hip surgery resulted in death of a patient (due to a GI bleeding, according to the 
autopsy). It is not straightforward to assess to what extent lack of efficacy of Cevenfacta contributed 
to the fatal outcome 3 days after surgery, especially because the patient also received treatment with 
FEIBA due to a bleeding at the surgery site, starting 1 day after surgery. Overall, the provided 
information underlines the importance of close follow-up during the postoperative phase. Upon 
request, the applicant included a statement in this regard in section 4.2. of the SmPC. 
The data for treatment of severe bleeding episodes is sparse. Only 6 severe bleeding events 
occurred in both on-demand treatment studies. The 3 severe bleedings in PerSept1 were successfully 
treated. However, confounding factors (e.g. much higher dose than pre-specified, concomitant 
treatment with antihaemorrhagic drug) influenced the outcome assessment. None of the 3 severe 
bleeding episodes in PerSept2 were considered successfully treated. The uncertainties regarding the 
dose recommendations for treatment of severe bleeding episodes and the prevention of bleedings 
following major surgeries were raised as a combined major objection. The responses are discussed in 
the discussion on clinical efficacy. Overall, it is acceptable not restricting the indication for adults and 
adolescents (i.e., including also the treatment of severe bleeding episodes). Table 1 in section 4.2 
recommends only the dosing regimen with the higher bolus dose (225 µg/kg), which is supported 
based on the available data.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the clinical trials, 172 adverse events were captured, of which less than 10% (n=13) were 
assessed as related. Many of the TEAE were infections like nasopharyngitis or diarrhoea, which are 
prevalent in children, or commonly occurring events, like headache. Most of the events assessed as 
related represented local or systemic infusion reactions and were graded as mild.  
The following AEs were identified as adverse events of special interest (AESIs): thromboembolic 
events, hypersensitivity reactions, and immunogenicity or antidrug antibodies (ADAs). No AESIs were 
reported in any of the four clinical studies. 
Of the 7 serious adverse events, 5 SAEs were reported from studies PerSept 1 and 2 and are either 
infections or spontaneous or traumatic bleeding and their sequelae. It is agreed with the assessment of 
the investigator that these SAEs can be classified as unrelated to Cevenfacta. Two related SAEs 
(gastrointestinal haemorrhage and blood loss anaemia) were reported from PerSept3. 
Evaluations of safety laboratory parameters and immunogenicity data did not reveal worrying signals.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The available safety database is small (n= 75) due to the fact that patients with haemophilia and 
inhibitors are rare, especially those who suffer from haemophilia B. Therefore, the very low number of 
patients with haemophilia B with inhibitors (n=4) and the low numbers of patients with haemophilia A 
with inhibitors (n=56) can be accepted as post-marketing safety follow-up via EUHASS and PEDNET 
registry is planned (please see RMP). The age range reached from 1 to 61 (1-56 in target patients with 
inhibitors), thus clinical experience in elderly patients, who are likely to have more cardiovascular risk 
factors promoting the incidence of thromboembolic events, is missing. The current safety database was 
further limited by the exclusion of patients with a higher risk of thromboembolic events, as well as 
severe comorbidities such as liver and/or renal impairment, active malignancy and 
immunosuppression. Patients with known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of to the 
product or to rabbit protein and patients with platelet count below 100 000/μL were also excluded from 
the clinical studies. 
The two related SAEs of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and blood loss anaemia leading to the death of 
one  patient in PerSept 3 happened shortly after withdrawal of Cevenfacta and initiation of treatment 
with FEIBA. However, an assessment of the relatedness of these events to the treatment with 
Cevenfacta is not straightforward and the applicant was asked to provide more insights into this event, 
where the main safety concern is lack of efficacy. The applicant provided the autopsy report and the 
DMC meeting minutes concerning this event. In the DMC meeting summary (03 January 2017), it is 
mentioned that there were discrepancies in the recordings made by the Investigator. The DMC 
expressed their concern about the overall management of the postoperative bleeding complication in 
this subject at this site and recommended that no new subjects be recruited at this site. In summary, 
despite persistent bleeding at the surgical site, no revision of the wound was performed in order to 
identify and manage bleeders. The gastrointestinal bleed started approximately two days after 
initiation of FEIBA, therefore a direct relationship is unlikely. 
Due to weight-based dosing, an increased or decreased dose of Cevenfacta despite a similar 
intravascular compartment is administered in patients with the same height but differing weight, which 
could lead to either lack of efficacy or safety consequences. The applicant was therefore asked to 
discuss if a minimum dose for underweight and a maximum dose for overweight patients should be 
specified or if at least a statement alerting the treating physician that dose based on bodyweight may 
require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients is warranted in the SmPC. The applicant 
provided evaluation of efficacy and estimated PK parameters in the three bodyweight categories. There 
was a trend towards lack of efficacy in underweight children <12 years of age, while estimated 
exposure in overweight patients was comparable to that in normal weight subjects. It is acknowledged 
that the current PK model is not optimal, but additional reassurance towards comparable safety is 
provided by the 284 treated bleeding episodes in overweight subjects in studies PerSept 1 and 2. 
In two paediatric subjects low calcium levels were observed and more information was requested. The 
applicant has adequately summarised the current knowledge on the association of hypocalcaemia and 
coagulopathy. At the time being it is not established if the hypocalcaemia represents a sequel of a 
trauma or bleeding event or if a pre-existing hypocalcaemia worsens the extent of bleeding. Therefore, 
no further helpful recommendation can be made in the SmPC, especially as it can be assumed that 
clinicians will monitor laboratory parameters in those patients who undergo major surgery or 
experience a major bleeding event as a matter of course.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The currently available treatment options for haemophilia patients with inhibitors are very limited. 
Timely control of spontaneous or traumatic bleeding events is essential to delay and/or prevent 
irreversible tissue and joint damage. The submitted data from PerSept1 show that Cevenfacta provides 
satisfactory efficacy and sufficiently quick onset of effect in patients ≥12 years of age. For the dose 
regimen with a higher bolus infusion (225 µg/kg), a better efficacy was noted in terms of proportion of 
success, time until success, and number of administrations needed, compared to the lower bolus dose 
(75 µg/kg). In contrast, the lower bolus dose resulted in a reduced amount of used Cevenfacta. The 
current version of the SmPC enables some flexibility in dosing, based on the patient’s individual 
response, which is endorsed and may lead to a dose sparing effect in some patients.  
For children <12 years of age the observed efficacy of Cevenfacta was not convincingly 
demonstrated. The analysis of outcomes of mild versus moderate bleeding events underlines that for 
mild bleeds either dosing regimen was efficacious in children. For moderate bleeds however, the 
repeated administration of 75µg is clearly preferable, but the success proportion is still distinctly lower 
than that observed in subjects ≥12 years of age, even if the underweight subject is excluded from the 
analysis. The influence of low bodyweight on the proportion of successfully treated bleeds is evident 
from the cohort of children <6 years of age, in which subject had a very low bodyweight for his age 
and was very likely underdosed due to the weight-based dosing scheme. PK modelling data intended to 
support an adequate dosing regimen in underweight children however, cannot be accepted due to 
doubts about the adequacy of the model and the reliability of paediatric PK data from trial PerSept 2 in 
general. 
The efficacy in severe bleeding events in children below 12 years of age is not established. 
The applicant clarified in their responses to the D 180 LoOI, that children below 12 years of age will be 
excluded from the indication, as no further data are available to support dosing recommendations and 
efficacy in this age group. 
The surgery trial PerSept3 shows that Cevenfacta is efficacious for intraoperative haemostasis during 
minor and major surgeries. However, there were 2 cases of treatment failures due to bleeding events 
in the postoperative phase. The applicant included a statement in the posology section to inform about 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 135/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the importance of close follow-up to enable early detection of potential postoperative bleeding events 
that may require adjustment of the dosing intervals.  
Only a minority of TEAE were assessed as related and most of these events represented local or 
systemic infusion reactions and were graded as mild. The serious adverse events were mainly either 
infections or spontaneous or traumatic bleeding. The adverse events of special interest (AESI) were 
defined as thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, and immunogenicity or antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs). No AESI were reported in any of the four clinical studies. However, the safety 
database is small due to the rarity of the disease. Post-marketing safety follow-up is planned via 
EUHASS and PEDNET registries. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The safety and efficacy of Cevenfacta can be considered as favourable in patients ≥12 years of age.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
While no difference regarding safety was noted in patients <12 years of age, Cevenfacta was clearly 
less efficacious in terms of time until and proportion of successfully treated bleeding events compared 
to children ≥12 years of age and adults. Additional review of the totality of the data shows that for 
children <12 years, the efficacy of both proposed dosing regimens of Cevenfacta was sufficiently 
shown for mild bleeding events only. With regard to efficacy in moderate and severe bleedings as well 
as the optimal dosing regimen for children below 2 years and for children with a low bodyweight for 
their age, substantial uncertainties remain and preclude a positive benefit risk balance.  
The age group of children <12 years of age is excluded from the indication, therefore the benefit risk 
balance in the remaining target population of adolescents ≥12 years and adults is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Cevenfacta is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Cevenfacta is not similar to Alprolix and Idelvion within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Cevenfacta is favourable in the following indications: 
Cevenfacta is indicated in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) for the treatment of 
bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those undergoing surgery or invasive 
procedures in the following patient groups:  
• 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with high-responding inhibitors to coagulation factors 
VIII or IX (i.e. ≥5 Bethesda Units (BU)); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/577398/2022  
Page 136/137 
 
 
 
• 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with low titre inhibitors (BU <5), but expected to have 
a high anamnestic response to factor VIII or factor IX administration or expected to be 
refractory to increased dosing of FVIII or FIX. 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of available data, it is considered that eptacog beta (activated) is not a new active 
substance in comparison to the known active substance eptacog alfa (activated) previously authorised 
in the European Union as NovoSeven on 23/02/1996 as it is not demonstrated that it differs 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and efficacy from the previously authorised substance. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0214/2017 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

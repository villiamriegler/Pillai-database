2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Rosacea  is  defined  as  a  chronic  dermatological  disease  typically  affecting  the  adult  population,  with 
prevalence between 2% and 10% in Europe (Berg 1989, Kyriakis 2005, Powell 2005, van Zuuren 2005). 
It affects mainly fair skinned population, with a higher occurrence in women. The course of the disease is 
chronic and different manifestations might occur simultaneously or separately, ranging from erythema 
and flushing to teleangectasia, papulo-pustular lesions, rhinophyma and ocular manifestations.  Onset 
typically occurs between 30 to 50 years of age.  Data also support that rosacea has an impact on patients’ 
quality of life (Crawford 2004). The course of the disease and time to progression to more severe forms 
is  unpredictable,  even  if  usually  rosacea  is  less  severe  and  more  prevalent  in  women,  with  the 
erythematotelangectasic subtype being the most frequent. In these cases, erythema is usually localised 
in the central area of the face and its intensity may range from mild and transient forms, to very severe 
forms and its intensity may worsen during the day and are influenced by many factors, such as alcohol, 
spicy foods, exercise and external temperature.  
According to the presence of different signs and symptoms, rosacea can be classified in four different 
sub-types based upon specific clinical signs and symptoms: erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (subtype 1), 
papulopustular rosacea (subtype 2), phymatous rosacea (subtype 3), ocular rosacea (subtype 4), and the 
variant granulomatous rosacea (Wilkin 2002). One of the most defining characteristic of the disease for 
both subtypes 1 and 2 is the presence of persistent erythema of the central portion of the face lasting for 
at  least  3  months  (Crawford  2004).  Erythema  with  or  without  telangectasia  (TGA)  is  the  basic 
manifestation that can usually be found in all rosacea subtypes. The disease may remain stable within one 
subtype  or  may  have  a  worsening  course,  ranging  from  the  basic  erythematous  variant  to  the  most 
severe forms with high number of inflammatory lesions, rhynophyma and ocular symptoms. 
Other primary symptomatology includes flushing, papules, pustules, and telangiectasias on the convex 
surfaces. Secondary characteristics are burning and stinging, oedema, plaques, a dry appearance, ocular 
manifestations,  and  phymatous  changes.  Erythematotelangiectatic  rosacea  (ETR),  which  is  the  most 
prevalent subtype, is principally characterized by the persistent central facial erythema with flushing and 
telangiectasia.  The  papulopustular  subtype  (PPR)  is  also  characterized  by  persistent  central  facial 
erythema, but also with episodic or persistent inflammation in the form of small to medium papules and 
pustules in a central facial distribution (Crawford 2004, Pelle 2008).  
The  pathophysiology  of  rosacea  is  poorly  understood  and  may  be  multifactorial,  involving  abnormal 
vascular reactivity, immune system responses, and follicular microorganisms (Crawford 2004, Nally 2006, 
Pelle 2008, Wolf 2005). Abnormalities in cutaneous vascular homeostasis, or vasomotor instability (the 
term commonly used to refer to abnormal involuntary dilatation and  reactivity of small subcutaneous 
resistance arteries), is commonly described as a pathogenic factor in the persistent facial erythema of 
rosacea.  The  aetiology  of  vasomotor  instability  in  patients  with  rosacea  is  unknown  (Crawford  2004, 
Kyriakis 2005, Pelle 2008, Wolf 2005). 
The condition is often worsened by factors like sunlight, strong wind, alcohol, coffee, spicy food, exercise, 
stress and some cosmetics. 
There are no approved pharmaceutical agents in Europe that directly target the persistent facial erythema 
of  rosacea.  There  are  several  pharmaceutical  treatments  to  the  management  of  rosacea;  they  are 
primarily  targeted  towards  the  papulopustular  rosacea  subtype  of  the  disease,  reducing  rosacea 
inflammatory lesions through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. They include local and systemic antibiotics

(metronidazole and tetracyclines), topical azelaic acid, isoflavonoid and laser and surgical treatments. 
Their activity on underlying erythema and flushing is based on reduction of inflammatory redness and 
long term action on small vessels, but they provide no immediate and evident improvement of baseline 
erythema that can be evident in the short term. 
About the product 
Brimonidine tartrate, the active substance of Mirvaso, is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, 
with potent vasoconstrictive / vasostabilising activity is currently approved as ophthalmic solution at the 
concentration of 0.2%, indicated for the treatment of intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma, with a 
posology  ranging  from  2  to  3  daily  administrations.  Erythema  of  rosacea  is  linked  to  permanent 
vasodilatation  of  small  vessels  and,  therefore,  treatments  that  might  work  on  vasoconstriction  and 
stabilisation of the contractile state of cutaneous small blood vessels might have a role in improving the 
erythematous manifestations of rosacea. Its mechanism of action includes vasoconstriction mediated by 
influence  on  postsynaptic  smooth  muscle  alpha2-adrenergic  receptors  stimulation.  It  is  extensively 
metabolised in humans, but absorption after ocular administration is very limited. On the basis of the 
known  activity  on  ophthalmological  diseases,  a  cutaneous  formulation  has  been  developed  by  the 
applicant, aiming at the treatment of vasodilatation of cutaneous small blood vessels that are involved in 
the pathophysiology of rosacea erythema. The mechanism of action should therefore imply a rapid onset 
and limited duration of activity, with no theoretical influence on other underlying factors involved in the 
pathophysiology of rosacea. The reduction of facial erythema would be of significant clinical benefit for 
patients who are affected by the erythematoteleangectasic variant of rosacea and would also improve the 
clinical manifestations of those with other types of rosacea. 
The product formulated is an aqueous gel formulation at the concentration of 0.5% brimonidine tartrate 
(which  corresponds  to  0.33%  brimonidine).  The  brimonidine  development  has  been  based  on  the 
concentrations and the posology already approved for the ophthalmic solution. The posology proposed for 
brimonidine tartrate gel is one daily administration, estimated to be no more than 1 g in total weight, is 
the  maximum  daily  recommended  dose.  The  to-be-marketed  drug  product  is  presented  in  laminated 
tubes with a child resistant cap to minimize the risk of accidental oral ingestion by children. 
The  finally  approved  indication  is  as  follows:  “For  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  facial  erythema  of 
rosacea in adult patients”.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The 
chemical 
name 
of 
brimonidine 
tartrate 
is 
5-Bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine  L-tartrate  and  has 
the 
following 
structural formulae: 
The structure of brimonidine tartrate was confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, 1H-NMR 
spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a white to slightly yellowish powder, not hygroscopic, freely soluble in water and 
insoluble in almost all organic solvents. Therefore, it is completely dissolved in the drug product and does 
not form a dispersion. 
Brimonidine base has no chiral centre and cannot show any optical activity. The source of optical activity 
is  tartaric  acid,  which  is  used  as  natural  L(+)-tartaric  acid.  Polymorphism  has  not  been  observed  for 
brimonidine. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Manufacture 
The  Active  Substance  Master  File  (ASMF)  procedure  was  followed  for  the  active  substance.  Letters  of 
access has been received from both ASMF Holders. 
Brimonidine tartrate is manufactured in two manufacturing sites.  
Brimonidine  tartrate  is  synthesized  in  four  main  steps  using  well  defined  starting  materials  with 
acceptable specifications. There are two slightly different synthetic routes with steps well defined. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual inspection), identification (IR and 
identification of tartrate),  pH (Eur. Ph.), melting range, loss on drying (Eur. Ph.), sulphated ash (Eur. 
Ph.), heavy metals (Eur. Ph.), related substances (HPLC), assay (titrimetry), specific optical rotation (Eur.

Ph.),  residual  solvents  (Eur.  Ph.)  and  content  of  tartrate  (potentiometry).  The  absence  of  a  test  for 
microbiological purity has been acceptably justified. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Brimonidine  tartrate  is  packaged  by  both  suppliers  in  double  polyethylene  bags.  The  filled  bags  are 
packed  inside  polyethylene  drums.  The  polyethylene  bags  comply  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  and  EU  directive 
2002/72. 
Batch  analysis  data  on  two  industrial  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  provided  from  each 
manufacturer. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on eight industrial batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in 
the intended commercial package for 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up 
to  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were 
provided. Results on stress conditions (UV light, day light and alkaline medium) were also provide on one 
batch. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, clarity of solution, colour of solution, pH of solution, 
loss on drying, HPLC purity and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
were stability indicating. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  an  aqueous  gel  containing  brimonidine 
tartrate to be used for the topical treatment of facial erythema of rosacea in adult patients. The objective 
was to develop a formulation with a texture adapted for application to the face that allowed the active 
substance to reach the site of action. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Purified water is used as a vehicle and solvent. Carbomer is used as 
a gelling agent. Methylparahydroxybenzoate and phenoxyethanol are included as preservatives to ensure 
microbiological  quality  of  the  gel.  Titanium  dioxide  is  added  to  ensure  that  a  more  visually  appealing 
colour  (white  to  off-white)  is  achieved  since  brimonidine  tartrate  may  cause  yellowing  of  the  finished 
product.  Propylene  glycol  is  added  as  a  humectant  and  solubiliser  for  both  brimonidine  tartrate  and 
methylparahydroxybenzoate.  Glycerol  is  used  as  humectant.  Sodium  hydroxide  is  added  to  the 
formulation in order to neutralize the acidic carbomer, essential for formation of the gelling network in 
order to obtain a viscous gel that is well adapted to a facial application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 10/107 
 
  
  
The  aqueous  solubility  of  brimonidine  tartrate  was  investigated  during  formulation  development.  The 
results  showed  that  brimonidine  tartrate  at  3.00%  w/w  was  dispersed  in  the  aqueous  phase  and 
concentrations at this level were no longer pursued. But below this concentration, brimonidine tartrate 
was fully dissolved.  
The levels of preservatives have been justified. 
The performance of the finished product was also assessed through an In Vitro Release Test (IVRT). The 
study was conducted in accordance with the FDA SUPAC guideline for semi-solid forms by comparing an 
industrial  registration  batch  with  a  laboratory  high  viscosity  batch  (viscosity=589,  500  mPa.s,  i.e. 
representative  of  the  upper  limit  of  the  specification)  and  a  laboratory  low  viscosity  batch 
(viscosity=304,500 mPa.s, i.e. representative of the lower limit of the specification). It was shown that 
the limits proposed for the viscosity range at release are validated. An additional IVRT was also performed 
with a stability batch at commercial batch size of 1,000 kg. The results showed that the release rates of 
the batches studied are similar, demonstrating their equivalence. These data support the consistency of 
the gel release performance between different batches and throughout the shelf life period. 
The  finished  product  has  been  developed  using  elements  of  Quality  by  Design  such  as  design  of 
experiments (DoE). In these studies, the homogeneity, colour, viscosity and pH of a prototype solution 
were  kept  constant  (  the  concentration  of  brimonidine  tartrate,  methylparahydroxybenzoate, 
phenoxyethanol and NaOH solution remained constant) and excipients affecting the texture and stability 
of  the  gel  (gelling  agent,  humectants,  and  opacifier)  were  changed.  Seventeen  formulations  were 
developed and examined. Based on the results from the DoEs, three formulations were selected to be 
used  in  clinical  studies.  The  results  from  the  clinical  studies  lead  to  the  selection  of  the  formulation 
proposed for marketing.  
Several manufacturing facilities have been used during development and different formulations were also 
developed  at  the  different  sites.  However  the  discrepancies  have  been  well  described  and  the  clinical 
batches are considered representative of the final formulation.  
Brimonidine tartrate gel is packaged in polyethylene (PE)/Aluminium (Al)/ Polyethylene (PE) laminated 
plastic tubes with a high density polyethylene (HDPE) head and polypropylene (PP) child resistant closure. 
All materials in direct contact with the product comply with the Ph. Eur. requirements. The child resistant 
effect has been demonstrated. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of Mirvaso comprises (1) preparation of the gel phase, (2) cooling, (3) pH 
adjustment and gel formation and (4) filling. 
Two in-process controls are performed during manufacturing: complete dissolution of the preservatives 
(mixing time and temperature must be controlled to ensure that methylparahydroxybenzoate is dissolved 
and that a  homogeneous mixture is obtained) and  pH of the final formulation (the pH of the  finished 
product after incorporation of sodium hydroxide must be controlled to ensure proper formation of the gel 
network). 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of pharmaceutical 
form.

Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance  (visual  examination), 
identification  of  brimonidine  (HPLC  and  UV),  identification  of  methylparahydroxybenzoate  and 
phenoxyethanol  (HPLC),  assay  of  brimonidine  (HPLC),  assay  of  methylparahydroxybenzoate  and 
phenoxyethanol (HPLC), pH (Ph.Eur.), viscosity (viscosimetry), impurities (HPLC) and microbial purity 
(Ph.Eur).  
Batch analysis results are provided on three industrial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The  viscosity  range  limits  are  acceptable,  however,  based  on  the  performed  IVRT  studies,  to  further 
validate the limits proposed for the viscosity range both at release and shelf life, an additional study on 
the in vitro release of brimonidine tartrate from a commercial batch should be performed. This request is 
included in the list of recommendations. 
All  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  validated.  The  HPLC  method  has  been  validated  for  specificity, 
linearity, range, accuracy, intermediate precision and robustness. The validation data demonstrated that 
the method is suitable for the identification and assay test of brimonidine, preservatives and impurities. 
For methods described in the Ph. Eur. validation was deemed to be unnecessary. The microbial purity of 
the drug product was compliant with Ph. Eur. requirements for preparations for cutaneous use. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and  30 ºC / 75% RH, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In addition, stability data on three 
production  scale  batches  stored  at  25ºC/60%  RH  for  9  months  and  cycled  through  either  cold/warm 
(5ºC/40ºC) or freeze/thaw (-18ºC/25ºC) conditions for two weeks were also provided. The batches of 
brimonidine tartrate are representative of those proposed for marketing but were packaged in a non-child 
resistant container closure system, i.e. different packaging material containing the same plastic polymers 
but with a non-child resistant cap.  
The parameters tested and the test methods used were the same as those proposed for release testing. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, three batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. The results of the studies showed that brimonidine tartrate gel was 
unstable when exposed directly to light. However, the primary packaging was found to adequately protect 
the finished product from exposure to light. 
In use stability studies were also performed on two batches of brimonidine tartrate. The results showed 
no significant change in the parameters tested and remained within the proposed specification. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and finished product have been adequately described. The excipients used in the 
preparation of the finished product and the manufacturing process selected are typical of a cutaneous 
preparation. The results of the tests indicate that the active substance and the finished product can be 
reproducibility  manufactured  and  therefore  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. The Committee recommends that the applicant performs an additional study on the in vitro release of 
brimonidine  tartrate  from a  commercial batch  to  further validate  the  limits  proposed  for the  viscosity 
range both at release and shelf life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Brimonidine tartrate is a well-known compound and has been extensively used in humans for more than 
15 years for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or 
ocular hypertension. 
The  Applicant  did  provide  already  available  data  from  peer-reviewed  literature  for  the  pharmacology 
studies, safety pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics and this appear to be well justified to support the 
present indication. 
The  nonclinical  toxicity  studies  were  all  conducted  in  compliance  with  Good  Laboratory  Practice 
regulations. The nonclinical toxicity studies performed with BT gel 0.5% formulation (the to be marketed 
formulation),  were  defined  pivotal  by  the  Applicant,  while  studies  that  were  not  performed  with  the 
to-be-marketed formulation including dose range finding (DRF) studies, are defined non-pivotal studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The justification by the Applicant not to perform new pharmacodynamic interaction studies is accepted. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Brimonidine tartrate is a α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with approximately 1000-fold more selectivity for the 
α2-adrenoreceptor  than  for  the  α1-adrenoreceptor.  There  is  no  available  animal  model  of  rosacea, 
therefore,  no  primary  pharmacodynamic  data  were  submitted  in  support  of  this  application  which  is 
accepted by the CHMP considering the extensive clinical experience with brimodine tartrate although at 
another therapeutic indication.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The information on secondary pharmacodynamics is rather sparse. A Pharmacology Overview table is 
provided below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 13/107 
 
  
  
 
Table 1. Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
ere  is  for  instance  no  information  on  affinity  of  brimonidine  tartrate  to  other  receptors/ion 
channels/transporters  except  affinity  to  α-adrenoceptors.  However,  the  clinical  experience  with 
brimonidine tartrate is extensive. Furthermore, the proposed indication with limited systemic absorption 
and  no  safety  concerns  due  to  systemic  effects,  overrules  the  lack  of  a  complete  receptor  screen  for 
Th
brimonidine.  
Mydriasis 
Brimonidine tartrate can induce mydriasis in rabbits, cats and monkeys but with a less marked effect 
compared  to  clonidine  and  apraclonidine,  due  to  its  low  affinity  for  the  α1-adrenoceptors  (Burke  and 
Potter 1986, Gabelt et al 1994, Burke and Schwartz 1996). At ophthalmic concentrations in the clinical 
treatment of glaucoma, brimonidine tartrate does not induce mydriasis, thus this effect is unlikely to be 
relevant for the proposed indication by the dermal route. 
Neuroprotection 
Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists are neuroprotective in a variety of animal models (Burke and 
Schwartz 1996). Neuroprotective effect is a general feature of α2 adrenergic receptor agonists, including 
brimonidine, although the underlying mechanism is unclear (Weber et al 2007). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology data from the literature are generally old, and the experimental designs are not in 
accordance with the current guidelines on safety pharmacology which can however be accepted since the 
clinical experience with brimonidine tartrate is extensive.  
Table 2. Effects on Central Nervous System  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 14/107 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 3. Effects on cardiovascular system 
Effects were characterized on the following organ systems; CNS, CV, respiratory, renal and pancreatic 
functions, and is overall associated with the primary pharmacology activity of brimonidine tartrate being 
a potent α2A-adrenoceptor agonist (exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects). Furthermore, the proposed 
indication with low systemic absorption, which is similar to that observed with ophthalmic instillation of 
brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution, and no safety concerns due to systemic effects noted in 
clinical trials, overrules the lack of a “modern” set of safety pharmacology studier. No exposure data are 
available in these animal species or routes of administration therefore no extrapolation can be made to 
human exposures. This is acceptable since exposure data from repeat dose toxicity studies are available. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The justification by the Applicant not to perform new pharmacodynamic interaction studies is accepted as 
brimonidine tartrate is a well-known active substance and has been extensively used in humans for more 
than 15 years. Possible pharmacodynamics drug interactions in humans are already well characterized 
and identified. It has been demonstrated in a human 4-week pharmacokinetic bridging study (Clinical 
study RD.06.SPR.18143) that brimonidine tartrate 5 mg/g Gel cutaneous treatments of rosacea patients 
with facial erythema resulted in systemic exposure which is in the same range as the systemic exposure 
after ophthalmic instillation of the eye drops when applied three times per day as recommended in the 
prescribing information for the ophthalmic product. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  in  animals  with  the  finished  product  brimonidine 
tartrate  0.5%  Gel.  A  summary  of  published  data  on  pharmacokinetic  properties  was  provided  by  the 
Applicant.  To  bridge  the  dermal  application  of  brimonidine  tartrate  gel  in  the  proposed  therapeutic 
indication, toxicokinetic data obtained in repeat-dose dermal toxicity studies conducted with the finished 
product are presented below.  
No tissue distribution study in animals or plasma protein binding study is available which is accepted 
considering the proposed topical use of the product.  
The Applicant has presented data on in vitro and in vivo metabolism in the rat. Metabolism is extensive 
both in vitro and in vivo in liver in man, monkey, rat and dog (Acheampong 1996).  This information is 
considered  of  limited  value  for  the  dermal  route  of  administration  since  the  systemic  absorption  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 15/107 
 
  
  
 
brimonidine is limited and the efficacy is mediated in the vessels of the skin. In vitro, at least 8 major drug 
metabolites (I, IIc, IIIa, IIIb, IV, V, VI, and VII) were detected in all species. The liver metabolite pattern 
for  rats,  rabbits  and  monkeys  was  qualitatively  quite  similar  to  that  for  humans.  Conversely,  the 
prominent metabolites in the dog were VI and VII. Metabolite IIc was only detected in rats and dogs, while 
IIIb was present only in monkeys and humans. After a 4-hour incubation of brimonidine tartrate, the 
highest metabolite fraction was noted in humans (88%), followed by monkeys (70%), rats (65%) and 
dogs (20%). 
Data  indicated  an  extensive  hepatic  metabolism of  brimonidine  tartrate  and  provided evidence  for  an 
involvement of aldehyde oxidase (Acheampong et al 1996). 
The principal metabolism pathways of brimonidine tartrate in rats, rabbits, monkeys and  humans are 
α(N)-oxidation  to  the  2,3-dioxobrimonidine,  and  oxidative  cleavage  of  the  imidazoline  ring  to 
5-bromo-6-guanidinoquinoxaline (Acheampong et al 1996). In contrary, the dog major metabolites were 
4’,5’-dehydrobrimonidine  (IIc)  and  5-bromo-6-guanidinoquinoxaline  (VI).  The  species  differences  in 
hepatic  brimonidine  tartrate  metabolism  were  likely  related  to  the  low  activity  of  dog-liver  aldehyde 
oxidase. 
There  is  only  limited  information  available  on  excretion  of  radiolabelled  brimonidine  after  ocular 
administration, indicating both rapid absorption and elimination. No information is available regarding 
excretion following dermal application. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Relevance of animal versus human skin – importance of vehicle 
Concerning local skin reactions and the value of animal species as predictors for these types of effects, it 
is  well-known  that  mouse/rat/rabbit  skin  is  more  sensitive  to  local  adverse  events  than  the  skin  of 
mini-pigs  and  humans.  Moreover,  percutaneous  absorption  is  several  times  higher  in  rodents  than  in 
mini-pigs and humans which leave the mini-pig as the animal species with highest relevance to humans. 
The vehicle in dermal products can have large influence on development of adverse local reactions. In 
many cases, it is not the active compound that causes adverse local reactions but the vehicle, also noted 
in the present set of dermal repeat-dose studies. The effect of a gel versus a cream formulation containing 
brimonidine tartrate were investigated in the rat and the minipig, and the cream formulation showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 17/107 
 
  
  
 
 
slightly worse histopathological changes than the gel formulation. The gel formulation is proposed for 
marketing,  and  the  pivotal  non-clinical  studies  have  been  performed  with  this  formulation,  which 
therefore has been adequately toxicologically tested.  
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose dermal toxicity studies are available and also no data on single dose toxicity after other 
modes  of  administration.  This  is  considered  acceptable  considering  that  brimonidine  tartrate  is  a 
well-known  active  substance  with  more  than  15  years  clinical  experience.  Toxicity  following  repeated 
dermal dosing has been sufficiently addressed. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The Applicant has performed repeat-dose dermal studies in hairless mice, rats and minipigs. Oral toxicity 
studies selected from the literature provides supplementary data at systemic exposure to brimonidine 
tartrate.  Since  brimonidine  tartrate  is  a  well-known  active  substance,  focus  will  be  on  the  proposed 
dermal route of administration.  
Only dedicated validated analytical methods used to analyse brimonidine plasma concentrations in GLP 
dermal toxicity studies in rats and minipigs performed by the Applicant to provide toxicology information 
are summarized in this section, since the old additional bioanalytical methods available in the literature 
are considered scarcely suitable and relevant for the present Assessment.  
On overview of the developed methods is given in the table 5 below.

Oral route of administration 
Toxicity  of  brimonidine  tartrate  was  evaluated  following  repeated  oral  administration  in  mice  (21 
months), rats (24 months) and monkeys (1 year) (Angelov et al 1996 p21). 
In chronic/carcinogenicity dietary toxicity studies in both rats (at 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day) and mice (at 2.5 
mg/kg/day), hypertrophy of the tunica muscularis and epithelial hyperplasia of the mucosa of the small 
and  large  intestine  were  by  the  authors  evaluated  as  exaggerated  pharmacological  effects  which 
generally reverted after treatment removal (Angelov et al 1996 p21). 
In monkeys (at 2.5 mg/kg/day), sedation, bradycardia, sinus arrhythmias, and hypotensive effects were 
noted, which by the authors were considered as exaggerated pharmacological effects and which were 
reversed during the recovery period (Angelov et al 1996 p21).

Exposure margins based on Cmax at NOAEL in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies is 19 in mice, 22 in rats 
and 146 in monkeys. The margins are considered sufficiently large. Furthermore, brimonidine tartrate is 
a marketed compound with systemic exposure at approved ophthalmic use at similar levels than those 
obtained at the proposed dermal use in the treatment of rosacea.  
Dermal route of administration 
Mice (13 weeks), rats (13 and 57 weeks) and mini-pigs (13 and 39 weeks) have been treated topically 
with brimonidine tartrate. A summary of performed studies can be seen below. 
Mice (13 weeks), rats (13 and 57 weeks) and mini-pigs (13 and 39 weeks) have been treated topically 
with brimonidine tartrate. Concerning local reactions and the value of animal species as predictors for 
these types of effects, mouse/rat/rabbit skin is more sensitive than the skin of minipig and humans. The 
cream formulation showed slightly worse microscopic properties than the gel formulation that is proposed 
for  marketing.  The  non-clinical  studies  with  the  longest  duration  were  performed  with  the  final  gel 
formulation proposed for marketing, which therefore has been adequately toxicologically qualified. 
The mouse 13 week study was performed as a dose-range finding study to the photo(co)carcinogenicity 
study and demonstrated various clinical signs and also a few deaths, where the  cause of death could not 
be  determined.  No  significant  skin  reaction  was  noted  either  with  or  without  UVR  exposure.  In  rats, 
adverse  effects  on  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  noted  in  both  the  13  and  57  weeks 
studies. Female animals dosed with high dose (2% gel) in the 57 week study showed treatment related 
mortality.  The  cause  of  death  was  only  determined  in  one  animal.  However,  the  clinical  signs  are 
considered  severe  enough  to  cause  death  of  the  animals.  No  signs  of  local  adverse  reactions  or 
histopathological signs of toxicity were noted in either rat study. The exposure margin (calculated on AUC 
values) at NOAEL in male animals is approximately 100 while it is 2000 in female animals. 
Due to skin similarities the studies in the minipig (13 weeks, 39 weeks) are considered the most important 
for non-clinical evaluation of safety of brimonidine tartrate. In the 13 week study, a comparison between 
gel and cream formulations was performed, and similarly as in the rat, the cream induced slightly worse 
microscopic findings. The microscopic findings were noted in all dosage groups, including vehicle, and 
may thus be related to the vehicle and not induced by brimonidine tartrate.  
In the 39 week pivotal minipig study, the animals were treated daily with 0.06, 0.18 and 1% brimonidine 
tartrate in a gel formulation. No treatment-related systemic clinical signs were observed. Furthermore, no 
ocular findings were seen and cardiovascular parameters were not affected. There were no differences in 
body weight, body weight gain or food consumption. There were no relevant treatment-related effects on 
haematology,  coagulation,  serum  clinical  chemistry,  urinary  parameters  or  organ  weights  and  no 
treatment-related  macroscopic  or  microscopic  pathological  findings.  To  conclude,  brimonidine  tartrate 
was well tolerated following topical administration in the minipig as might be expected considered the 
higher  susceptibility  of  mouse  and  rat  skin.  Toxicokinetic  data  obtained  in  minipig  (see  above) 
demonstrated a dose related systemic exposure to brimonidine tartrate in both male and female animals 
with  no  sex  related  differences.  The  exposure  margin  (calculated  on  AUC  values)  at  NOAEL  in  male 
animals is 12 while it is 14 in female animals. 
Genotoxicity  
Literature data has demonstrated that brimonidine tartrate has no genotoxic potential. The absence of 
new  genotoxicity  data  is  considered  acceptable  since  brimonidine  tartrate  is  a  well-known  active 
substance  with  more  than  15  years  clinical  experience  in  treatment  of  ocular  hypertension  and 
open-angle glaucoma.

Carcinogenicity study 
No carcinogenic potential of brimonidine tartrate has been demonstrated in published dietary studies in 
mice and rats. No toxicokinetic data are available from these studies. However, extrapolation of plasma 
drug concentrations at the highest dose level in mice resulted in large exposure margins (4.53 ng/mL in 
mice /46 pg/ml in humans) in both sexes. In rats, a similar large exposure margin was obtained (6.90 
ng/mL in rats /46 pg/ml in humans).  
In support of the application, a dermal photo (co)carcinogenicity study (RDS.03.SRE.12629) in mice and 
a 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study (RDS.03.SRE.12667) in rats supported by toxicokinetic data have 
been performed. Hairless mice were treated dermally with brimonidine tartrate gel 0.18, 1.0, 2.0% (100 
µL/mouse) 5 times/week for 40 weeks. In addition, the animals were exposed to ultraviolet radiation 
exposure, 600 RBU/week in all groups except one control group which received 1200 RBS/week. The high 
UVR  calibration  group  was  terminated  earlier  in  week  41  due  to  an  UVR  dose-dependent  tumour 
response. Brimonidine tartrate did not enhance photocarcinogenesis in the hairless mouse. In contrast, a 
brimonidine  tartrate  induced  and  dose-dependent  delay  in  UVR-induced  skin  tumour  development, 
compared with only UVR exposure, was observed. 
In the dermal carcinogenicity study, rats were treated with; 0.03, 0.06, 0.18% male animals and 0.18, 1, 
2% in females for 24 months. Dosing of mid and high dose females were reduced to 0.36% and 0.72% 
after 49 weeks due to decreased survival. Survival rate at the end of the study was acceptable for study 
interpretation.  Before  death,  behavioural  (decreased  activity,  clonic  convulsions,  hypersensitivity  to 
touch,  vocalization)  and  gastrointestinal  (distended  abdomens  and  low  carriage)  clinical  signs  were 
observed which are assessed as exaggerated pharmacological response to alpha2-receptor stimulation. 
The most common cause of death was pituitary tumour in all dose groups including control groups which 
is a common cause of death in aged rats. No treatment-related clinical signs of systemic toxicity were 
noted.  No  treatment-related  local  effects,  only  slight  occurrence  of  erythema  was  observe  and  no 
treatment-related  neoplastic  or  non-neoplastic  findings.  Toxicokinetic  data  demonstrates  that  the 
animals were exposed to brimonidine tartrate in a dose-related manner.  
To conclude, brimonodine tartrate is not genotoxic and not carcinogenic in a photo (co)carcinogenicity 
study in hairless mice and in a conventional dermal carcinogenicity studies in rats. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The Applicant has not performed any studies to evaluate the reproductive and developmental toxicity of 
brimonidine tartrate gel. This section is documented by literature data with brimonidine tartrate given 
orally. No adverse findings on reproductive function have been noted in oral studies with brimonidine 
tartrate. Since the systemic exposure of brimonidine tartrate is similar following dermal administration 
compared to the approved ocular route of administration, there are no concerns for human safety. The 
SmPC section 4.6 is worded in a similar way as for the approved ocular product which is accepted. 
No studies in juvenile animals has been performed which is acceptable since rosacea does not occur in 
children.

Local Tolerance  
Three local tolerance studies have been performed investigating primary skin irritation and phototoxicity, 
eye irritation and skin sensitization. Brimonidine tartrate gel formulation did not cause primary irritation 
to the skin and was not phototoxic at concentrations up to 2%. It was not irritating to the eye at 0.5% and 
did not produce skin sensitization at 2%.  
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities 
The  impurity  profile  of  Mirvaso  has  been  qualified.  The  pivotal  dermal  chronic  toxicity  studies 
(rat/minipig)  and  the  rat  dermal  carcinogenicity  study  were  performed  with  batches  having  identical 
impurity profiles and specifications compared to those used in the clinical pivotal studies representing the 
drug product proposed for marketing. With regards to impurities, it seems reasonable to conclude that no 
toxicological concern is raised. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant conducted a valid Early Life Stage (ELS) Toxicity test with Danio rerio, in compliance to 
OECD 210 guideline; the study report (Study Report N0.714A-101) and the updated Environmental Risk 
Assessment report

Assessment for the active substance Brimonidine tartrate, were submitted. The test was conducted with 
test concentrations of 0.1, 0.32, 1.0, 3.2, and 10 mg brimonidine tartrate/L. A NOEC of 0.32 mg/L was 
obtained,  based  on  survival.  Growth,  measured  as  total  length,  wet  and  dry  weight,  was  the  most 
sensitive biological endpoint measured in this study. 
The LOEC for growth was 0.1 mg/L; an EC10 of 0.019 mg/L based on the wet weight, 0.063 mg/L based 
on the dry weight and 0.11 mg/L based on the length were calculated as recommended in the OECD 210 
guideline. The Applicant acknowledges that the calculated values of the EC10 based on the weights do not 
fully comply with specific recommendation of OECD 210, revision July 2013, i.e. the test concentrations 
should bracket the EC10 so that it comes from interpolation rather than extrapolation; and, as a general 
guide, EC10 might be not more than about 25% below the lowest tested concentration (0.1 mg/L). The 
Applicant  is  recommended  to  repeat  the  Early  Life  Stage  (ELS)  Toxicity  test  with  Danio  rerio,  and  to 
provide the Agency with the test results at a post-approval stage. 
Nevertheless, the Applicant highlighted that a large safety margin is obtained with the current EC10 value 
of  19  μg/L  for  the  effects  of  brimonidine  tartrate  on  aquatic  environment:  the  current  calculation  of 
PEC/PNEC ratio is based on the PEC surface water of 0.025 μg/L and the PNEC surface water of 1.9 μg/L, 
determined from the EC10 in Danio rerio. The resulting PEC/PNEC ratio is 13.2.10-3. It is unlikely that a 
refined NOEC value as low as 0.25 μg/L (76 times lower than the current EC10) will be obtained with the 
new run of experiment, resulting in a PEC/PNEC ratio higher than the threshold value of 1, which would 
trigger further testing in the aquatic compartment. 
The current estimate of PEC/PNEC ratio (0.025/1.9 = 0.013) is below the threshold but CHMP does not 
know the response in the full range due to the extrapolation and therefore cannot endorse the comment 
of the Applicant stating that “is unlikely that a refined NOEC value as low as 0.25 μg/L (76 times lower 
than the current EC10) will be obtained with the new run of experiment”. 
The CHMP recommends therefore the Applicant to repeat the Early Life Stage (ELS) Toxicity test with 
Danio rerio, and to provide the Agency with the test results in the context of a recommendation.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
There  is  no  in  vivo  animal  model  of  rosacea  available  and  therefore  primary  pharmacodynamics  of 
brimonidine tartrate is not included in this application. This is accepted, since there is extensive clinical 
experience of brimonidine tartrate at another therapeutic indication (treatment of open angle glaucoma 
and elevated intraocular pressure). The data submitted for this application fulfil the requirements.  
Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic studies in animals were performed using the finished product brimonidine tartrate 
0.5% gel for topical administration. Instead a summary of published data on pharmacokinetic properties 
was provided by the Applicant. The metabolism data provided was also based on the literature. No animal 
data  on  excretion  of  brimonidine  tartrate  was  provided,  which  is  accepted  considering  the  proposed 
topical use of the product. 
Toxicology 
The Applicant has focused on the dermal safety and local tolerance of the product.  All other aspects of the 
nonclinical toxicology are based on published data. Neither dermal toxicity studies nor local tolerance 
studies showed any adverse effects related to brimonidine tartrate. The CHMP recommends the Applicant 
who is recommended to repeat the Early Life Stage (ELS) Toxicity test with Danio rerio, and to provide the 
Agency with the test results in the context of a recommendation.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
All  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  compliance  with  GLP.  Overall  the  non-clinical  program 
conducted  by  the  Applicant  meets  the  requirements  and  the  data  are  acceptable  from  the 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic point of view; brimonidine tartrate is well characterized. 
Overall, the majority of the non-clinical issues have been satisfactorily addressed in the SmPC. There is no 
potential safety issue, the product is deemed to be well tolerated when used in the proposed dosage. The 
CHMP recommends the Applicant to repeat the Early Life Stage (ELS) Toxicity test with Danio rerio, and 
to provide the test results.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted  with  the  aim  to  explore  the  systemic 
exposure following topical administration of brimonidine tartrate gel compared to ophthalmic instillation 
of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.2%  ophthalmic  solution  (Table  1).  The  comparison  enables  to  bridge  with 
non-clinical systemic safety data for brimonidine tartrate by referring to the safety data for the 0.2% 
ophthalmic solution. 
Among the three relative bioavailability studies, only Study RD.06.SRE.18143 is regarded as definitive 
because  the  study  was  conducted  in  subjects  with  rosacea,  included  the  intended  to-be-marketed 
formulation, used the more sensitive analytical method (LOQ=10 pg/ml), and evaluated repeated dosing 
of Brimonidine tartrate gel (29 days).  
In addition, plasma exposure following supra-therapeutic dosing of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic 
solution was evaluated in a QTc study. 
The substance codes COL-118 or CD07805/47 have been used for brimonidine tartrate gel in some of the 
clinical pharmacology studies. 
Analytical methods 
The  bioanalytical  method  for  the  determination  of  brimonidine  in  human  plasma  were  adequately 
validated through a HPLC method with tandem mass spectrometry detection (MS/MS).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 28/107 
 
  
  
 
 
The method used in studies COL-118-BAPK-101 and RD.06.SRE.18126 was developed at Covance and 
was successfully validated over a concentration range of 0.025 to 5.00 ng/ml. Sodium heparin, K2EDTA 
or K 3EDTA was used as anticoagulant (cross-validated). 
In order to decrease the limit of quantitation, a new HPLC method with MS/MS detection was developed 
at York Bioanalytical Solutions and used in the clinical study RD.06.SRE.18139 for the determination of 
brimonidine in human plasma. The method was successfully validated over a concentration range of 0.01 
to 25.00 ng/ml.  
The lower LOQ was also applied in the bioanalytical method used in study RD.06.SRE.18143. The method 
was developed and used at Galderma R&D and was successfully validated over a concentration range of 
0.010 to 5.00 ng/ml. Brimonidine and the internal standard, brimonidine-d4, were extracted from human 
plasma by liquid phase extraction. After evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and 
analysed. Results were calculated using peak area ratios, and calibration curves were generated using a 
weighted  (1/x2)  linear  least-squares  regression.  Satisfactory  between-  and  within-run  accuracy  and 
precision was shown for low, medium and high QC sample concentrations.  
Satisfactory method performance during study sample analysis was demonstrated, including acceptable 
overall  (mean)  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  QC  samples  of  all  accepted  runs.  Appropriate  batch 
acceptance criteria were used.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard methods were used in the non-compartmental analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods.  
Relative bioavailability was calculated by the following parameters for each subject:  
AUC ratio: Ratio of AUC0-24h of topical gel to ophthalmic solution corrected by the dose ratio. 
Cmax ratio: Ratio of Cmax of topical gel to ophthalmic solution corrected by the dose ratio. 
Daily applied doses:  
-The  daily  applied  dose  for  the  brimonidine  ophthalmic  solution  was  determined  in  a  mock  dose 
experiment and the results were: Assuming that the weight of 1 eye drop was 30.7 mg, the daily applied 
dose  of  brimonidine  tartrate  was  0.37  mg  (0.061  mg  of  brimonidine  tartrate  per  drop  of  ophthalmic 
solution x 3 doses per day x 2 eyes). 
-Taking into account that 1 g of gel was applied, the daily topical applied doses of brimonidine tartrate in 
the treatment groups were 1.4 mg (0.07% BID), 1.8 mg (0.18% QD), 3.6 mg (0.18% BID) and 5 mg 
(0.5% QD). 
Plasma levels that were below LOQ were replaced by LOQ (10 pg/ml) for mean Cmax calculation and if 
AUC0-24h was not reportable and the corresponding Cmax was <10 pg/ml, the AUC0-24h were replaced by 
10 pg·h/ml for statistical analysis. 
Statistical analysis 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarised using descriptive statistics.  
The PK parameters from topical treatment (AUC0-24h and Cmax) were examined for treatment effect and 
time  effect  by  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  using  PROC  MIXED  procedure  in  SAS  including  the 
corresponding PK value from the ophthalmic solution as a covariate, and subject, time, treatment and 
time*treatment  as  factors  in  the  model.  The  AUC0-24h  and  Cmax  data  were  transformed  into  natural 
logarithms (ln) prior to analysis.

Absorption  
Bioavailability 
No studies were performed to evaluate the absolute bioavailability of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel. The 
relative  bioavailability  was  investigated  in  three  studies  comparing  topical  application  of  brimonidine 
tartrate gel with ophthalmic instillation of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution.  
Plasma  concentrations  of  brimonidine  following  topical  application  of  the  gel  could  not  be  detected  in 
studies  COL-118-BAPK-101  and  RD.06.SRE.18126  since  all  samples  was  below  the  lower  limit  of 
quantitation (LOQ) of the bioanalytical method. In study RD.06.SRE.18143, the LOQ was decreased to 10 
pg/ml and the plasma exposure was evaluable. 
The plasma exposure was also evaluated in a QTc-study (Study RD.06.SRE.18139) following ophthalmic 
instillation of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution. 
Study  COL-118-BAPK-101  was  a  single-dose  relative  bioavailability  study  comparing  topical 
application  of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.2%  gel  with  ophthalmic  instillation  of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.2% 
ophthalmic  solution  in  healthy  subjects.  This  was  an  open-label,  randomised,  2-way,  crossover  study 
conducted in 16 healthy subjects. The study consisted of two treatment periods, with a wash-out of at 
least 1 day between periods. The brimonidine tartrate 0.2% gel was applied as 1 g applied to the entire 
face and the brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution was administered as 1 drop in each eye. Blood 
samples were collected pre-dose and up to 8 hours after administration. 
Results: Following treatment with brimonidine tartrate 0.2% gel, all plasma concentrations of brimonidine 
were below the LOQ of 25 pg/ml and consequently no pharmacokinetic parameters could be calculated 
and  the  relative  bioavailability  could  not  be  evaluated.  However  the  plasma  concentrations  following 
treatment with brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution could be detected in 14 of the 16 subjects 
and the pharmacokinetic evaluation resulted in the following plasma exposure: mean Cmax was 51±16 
pg/ml (range: <25-76 pg/ml), AUC0-t was 152±75 pg*h/ml (range: <25-313 pg*h/ml) and median tmax 
was 2 hours. 
Study RD.06.SRE.18126 was a single-day relative bioavailability study comparing topical application of 
brimonidine  tartrate  0.18%  gel  with  ophthalmic  instillation  of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.2%  ophthalmic 
solution  in  subjects  with  rosacea.  This  was  a  double-blind,  randomised,  vehicle-controlled,  2-way, 
crossover study conducted in 20 subjects with moderate to severe rosacea. The study consisted of two 
treatment periods, with a wash-out of at least 1 day between periods. The brimonidine tartrate 0.18% gel 
was applied as two doses (1 g per application) with a 4-hour interval between doses and the brimonidine 
tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution was administered once as 1 drop in each eye. Blood samples were 
collected pre-dose and at 1, 2, 3, 4 (prior to second dose of brimonidine tartrate gel), 5, 6, 7 and 8 hours 
after administration. 
Results: Following treatment with brimonidine tartrate 0.18% gel, no pharmacokinetic parameters could 
be calculated since all plasma concentrations of brimonidine were below the LOQ of 25 pg/ml except one 
single value of 60 pg/ml detected 1 hour after the second application. The value was inconsistent with the 
flat pharmacokinetic profile expected after topical application and was considered as an outlier value.  
Following treatment with brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution plasma concentrations could be 
detected in 11 of the 18 subjects who received the ophthalmic solution. Mean Cmax and AUC  was not 
calculated but the Cmax ranged from <25-100 pg/ml, the AUC0-t from <25-471 pg*h/ml and t max ranged 
from 0.9-4.1 hours. 
The  relative  bioavailability  was  calculated  using  the  LOQ  (25  pg/ml)  as  Cmax  for  brimonidine  tartrate 
0.18% gel and the highest Cmax (100 pg/ml) obtained with the brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic 
Assessment report

solution. Based on this calculation, the relative bioavailability comparing topical route to the ophthalmic 
route was less than 3%. 
In  both  Studies  COL-118-BAPK-101and  RD.06.SRE.18126  plasma  concentrations  of  brimonidine 
following topical application of the gel could not be detected since all samples was below the lower limit of 
quantitation (LOQ) of the bioanalytical method and consequently the relative bioavailability could not be 
calculated. The plasma concentrations of brimonidine following ophthalmic administration of the 0.2% 
solution (single dose, one drop in each eye) could be detected in some of the subjects and resulted in a 
Cmax that ranged from <25-100 pg/ml and AUC0-t from <25-471 pg*h/ml. Therefore the results from the 
two studies are considered as non-conclusive and are not discussed further.  
Study RD.06.SRE.18143 was a phase I, multi-centre, randomised, evaluator-blinded, intra-individual 
comparative pharmacokinetic study of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and brimonidine 
tartrate topical gel (CD07805/47) (0.07%, 0.18% and 0.50%) applied under maximal use conditions in 
subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea. On day 1, all subjects received 
3  doses  of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.2%  ophthalmic  solution  (1  drop  in  each  eye  every  8  hours  over  a 
24-hour  period).  After  a  2-day  washout  period,  subjects  were  distributed  among  4  treatment  groups 
(randomised on day 1) to receive brimonidine tartrate 0.07% gel BID, 0.18% gel QD, 0.18% gel BID or 
0.5% gel QD during days 4 to 32. To ensure maximal use conditions of brimonidine tartrate gel, 1 g of gel 
QD or BID was applied to the entire face (3% of body surface area) for 4 weeks (total daily dose of gel: 
1 g or 2 g). Subjects in the BID dosing groups received the second dose 6 hours after the first application. 
The blood sampling schedule is described in table 13. 
Table 13. Pharmacokinetic blood sampling schedule in Study RD.06.SRE.18143. 
Results:  Daily  topical  application  for  29  days  demonstrated  quantifiable  plasma  concentrations  (≥10 
pg/ml) in 22%, 48%, 71% and 79% of subjects receiving brimonidine tartrate 0.07% gel BID, 0.18% gel 
QD, 0.18% gel BID and 0.5% gel QD, respectively. Ophthalmic instillation of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% 
solution resulted in quantifiable plasma concentrations in all 96 subjects who received all three doses. 
Plasma  sample  concentrations  from  5  subjects  following  topical  application  were  excluded  from  the 
pharmacokinetic  analysis  due  to  abnormally  high  plasma  concentrations  in  comparison  to  the  overall 
concentration data and within-subject individual plasma concentration profiles. These plasma samples 
were reassayed using back-up aliquots (if available) and all the values were confirmed. The outlier values 
were excluded since the abnormal plasma concentrations might be due to sample contamination. Three 
individuals  in  dose  group  0.07%  BID  (#8319-027,  #8319-074,  #8319-086)  had  all  plasma 
concentrations  below  LOQ  except  one  concentration  with  values  that  ranged  from  324.61  to  686.11 
pg/ml.    One  individual  in  dose  group  0.5%  QD  (#8319-031)  had  one  plasma  concentration  of 
6265.92 pg/ml, which is 100-fold higher than Cmax. In one of the individuals in dose group 0.18% BID, 
outlier data points were detected at all three days (days 4, 18 and 32) but since one application was 
missed at day 18 the subject was excluded from further pharmacokinetic analysis.  
Mean pharmacokinetic parameters of brimonidine following ocular administration of 0.2% solution and 
topical  administration  of  0.5%  gel  are  summarised  in  Table  3.  Following  TID  dosing  of  brimonidine

tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution the time-concentration profiles were characterized by three distinct 
peaks and the observed mean Cmax (±SD) was 54±28 pg/ml, mean AUC0-24h (±SD) was 568±277 pg·h/ml 
and t max ranged from 0.65-18.02 hours. Following repeated administration of the 0.5% gel, the highest 
mean exposures were observed after 15 days of topical application (Cmax = 46±62 pg/ml,  AUC0-24h  = 
417±264 pg·h/ml). The time-concentration profiles for brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel were flat, with tmax 
values  ranging  from  pre-dose  to  24  hours  post-dose.  Following  the  other  three  topical  dose  groups 
(0.07%  BID,  0.18%  QD,  0.18%  BID),  the  highest  plasma  exposure  were  observed  at  the  end  of  the 
treatment  period  (after  29  days  of  topical  application).  The  observed  mean  C max  (±SD)  were  13  ±  9 
pg/ml, 17± 20 pg/ml, 18 ± 10 pg/ml, 26 ± 24 pg/ml and mean AUC0-24h were 42 ± 74 pg·h/ml, 93 ± 117 
pg·h/ml, 193 ± 155 pg·h/ml, 290 ± 242 pg·h/ml following 29 days of topical application of brimonidine 
tartrate gel 0.07% BID, 0.18% QD, 0.18% BID or 0.5% QD, respectively.

(a)  Note: BLQ data value replaced by LOQ (10 pg/ml) for mean Cmax calculation; AUC 0-24h were calculated only if there is at 
least one quantifiable time point. However, for statistical analysis not reportable AUC0-24h were replaced by the lowest 
AUC0-24h calculated in this study (i.e. 10 pg*h/ml). 
The study design allowed for intra-subject comparisons of the systemic exposure (expressed as Cmax or 
AUC0-24h) following the topical administered gel formulation compared to the ophthalmic solution and 
irrespective of the concentration and dose regimen, the topical/ocular ratios calculated over the entire 
brimonidine tartrate gel treatment period were significantly lower than 1. 
The relative bioavailability was calculated comparing plasma exposure (using C max or AUC0-24h) following 
topical  application  of  brimonidine  tartrate  gel  with  ophthalmic  instillation  and  corrected  by  the  daily 
applied dose. The daily applied dose for brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution was determined in a 
mock dose experiment. The relative bioavailability (±SD) comparing topical route to the ophthalmic route 
was low ranging from 5% (±3%) to 9% (±6%) using AUC0-24h and from 4% (±2%) to 9% (±12%) using 
Cmax. 
Intra-subject comparison of topical/ocular exposure ratio were significantly lower than 1 over the entire 
brimonidine  tartrate  gel  treatment  period.  However  comparison  of  the  mean  values  results  in  similar 
plasma exposures regarding both AUC and Cmax. The highest exposure following topical administration

was observed after 15 days with the Cmax of 46±62 pg/ml and AUC0-24h of 417±264 pg·h/ml and following 
ocular  administration  TID  Cmax  was  54±28  pg/ml  and  AUC0-24h  was  568±277  pg·h/ml.  Hence,  the 
brimonidine mean systemic exposure (Cmax) following ocular route is 1.2 times higher than the highest 
mean  Cmax  obtained  following  topical  route.  Considering  TID  ophthalmic  dosing  instead  of  the 
recommended BID dosing, the systemic exposure of brimonidine following ocular administration might be 
overestimated. As discussed by the applicant considering the short terminal half-life of brimonidine via 
the ophthalmic route, the Cmax would be unchanged with a BID or TID dosing regimen, but AUC will be 
probably be higher after TID dosing. 
Relative bioavailability of topical administration compared to ocular administration was calculated by the 
ratio  of  Cmax  or  AUC  (taking  into  account  that  different  doses  were  administered).  Mean  Relative 
bioavailability were similar among the treatment groups and ranged from 5 to 9% when calculated using 
AUC0-24hr, and from 4 to 9% when calculated using Cmax. 
Despite  the  appropriate  written  instructions  provided  to  sites  in  the  study  protocol,  abnormally  high 
plasma concentrations were specifically observed in 1 investigational site. Furthermore, the PK profile 
observed in Study 18143 demonstrated that there was no drug accumulation over the treatment period 
that could have accounted for these high values. There is no apparent physiological explanation for the 
outlier  values  considering  the  route  of  administration  because  these  plasma  fluctuations  (i.e.  32-  to 
100-fold higher than the baseline levels in a short time period) were rapid with short spikes. 
Therefore, the Applicant’s original explanation that these abnormally high values are likely due to ex vivo 
sample contamination is upheld. The explanation regarding the excluded outlier data is acceptable.  
Study RD.06.SRE.18139 was a QTc study in healthy subjects with the objective to evaluate the effect 
on  ventricular  repolarisation  following  a  single  ocular  dose  of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.2%  ophthalmic 
solution (supra-therapeutic dose of 2 drops instilled in each eye, with a 3-minute dosing interval). The 
rationale  for  using  the  ophthalmic  solution  instead  of  brimonidine  tartrate  gel  was  to  allow  a  higher 
exposure than would have been achievable with topical application of brimonidine tartrate gel. This was 
a  positive-  and  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  randomised,  single-dose,  3-way  crossover  study 
conducted in 60 healthy subjects. Moxifloxacin was used as an active control. Subjects were randomised 
to 1 of 6 treatment sequences (ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC or CBA) with a 6-day washout period between 
periods. The 3 study treatments are described in the table 15 below. 
Table 15. Study treatments. Study RD.06.SRE.18139.   
Blood samples for the determination of brimonidine were collected pre-dose and at 42 min, 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 
4.2, 6.2, 8.2, 10.2, 12.2 and 23.2 hours after administration.

The Cmax achieved following the claimed supra-therapeutic ophthalmic dose was 54±24 pg/ml (range 
22-156  pg/ml,  CV=44%).  The  mean  Cmax  is  similar  as  in  the  study  RD.06.SRE.18143  where  Cmax 
following ophthalmic dose TID (1 drop in each eye every 8 hours over a 24-hour period) was 54±28 pg/ml 
(range  16-134  pg/ml,  CV=52%).  These  values  are  in  the  same  range  as  following  repeated 
administration of 0.5% brimonidine tartrate gel where the highest exposure was obtained after 15 days 
of  topical  application  with  a  Cmax  value  of  46±62  pg/ml  (range  10-255  pg/ml,  CV=133%).    The 
inter-individual variability following topical administration is higher compared to the supra-therapeutic 
ophthalmic  administration  and  the  individual  with  the  highest  plasma  exposure  following  topical 
administration of the gel (Cmax=255 pg/ml) is above the highest plasma exposure following the claimed 
supra-therapeutic ophthalmic dose (Cmax=156 pg/ml).  
In conclusion, the ophthalmic dose of 2 drops in each eye is not considered to generate supra-therapeutic 
conditions since the mean Cmax in the QTc study is similar to the Cmax following therapeutic ocular dosing 
and in the same range as the highest mean Cmax following topical administration. 
Distribution 
The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied which is accepted considering the proposed 
topical use of the product 
Elimination 
Brimonidine  is  extensively  metabolised  in  the  liver.  Urinary  excretion  is  the  route  of  elimination  of 
brimonidine and its metabolites. This is reflected in section 5.2 in the SmPC. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
For topical application of brimonidine tartrate gel, systemic exposure increased with applied dose and 
statistical analysis showed that the increase in exposure (Cmax) was slightly less than dose proportional. 
After 29 days of brimonidine tartrate gel application, the Cmax high dose (0.5% QD, 5 mg applied daily) to 
low dose (0.07% BID, 1.4 mg applied daily) ratio was 1.5 (90% CI 121 to 197%) in comparison with the 
3.6-fold increase in daily dose and Cmax high dose (0.5% QD, 5 mg applied daily) to mid dose (0.18% QD, 
1.8 mg applied daily) ratio was 1.4 (90% CI 107 to 171%) in comparison with the 2.8-fold increase in 
daily  dose.  Following  topical  administration  Cmax  tended  to  increase  slightly  less  than  proportional  to 
dose. However, due to limited number of subjects with quantifiable plasma concentrations at the end of 
the brimonidine tartrate gel treatment period for the two lowest doses (22% for 0.07% BID and 48% for 
0.18% QD), the dose proportionality data should be interpreted with caution. 
Time dependency 
The  systemic  exposure  following  one  day  of  topical  application  was  comparable  with  the  exposure 
following  29  days  of  topical  application  in  all  treatment  groups  with  Day  32/  Day  4  ratios  for  C max  of 
110-124%. The Day 32/Day 18 ratio for the 0.5% group was 61% and the Day 18/Day 4 ratio was 180%, 
which could be attributed to high isolated plasma levels observed at day 18. Day 32/Day 4 ratios for 
AUC0-24h  ranged  from  113-145%.  Of  note,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  quantifiable  plasma 
concentrations (especially in the two lowest dose groups) and the imputation method for AUC0-24h, the 
statistical analysis should be interpreted with caution for AUC0-24h. In conclusion, the statistical analysis 
suggested  no  drug  accumulation  throughout  the  treatment  duration  (4  weeks)  irrespective  of  the 
concentration and dose regimen. 
Residual concentrations (Cthrough) were analysed on day 4, 5, 10, 18, 19, 24 and 32. At day 4 all Cthrough 
(pre-dose, before the first topical application of gel) were below the LOQ confirming that the wash-out 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 34/107 
 
  
  
period  following  ocular  administration  on  day  1  was  long  enough.  Mean  Cthrough  values  remain  stable 
during the 4 weeks of topical treatment ranging from <10 to 12.0 pg/ml for the 0.07% BID group, from 
<10 to 14.7 pg/ml for the 0.18% QD group, from 10.3 to 13.3 for the 0.18% BID group and from 12.0 to 
15.1 pg/ml for the 0.5% QD group. 
Overall a time stationarity of the PK parameters (Cmax, Cthrough, AUC0-24h) was observed after repeated 
topical application of brimonidine tartrate gel (0.07% QD, 0.18% QD, 0.18% BID and 0.5% QD) and thus 
no  further  accumulation  would  be  expected  with  a  longer  treatment  period.  No  evidence  of 
time-dependent pharmacokinetics was seen. 
Special populations 
No studies have been performed in special populations. This is also reflected in the SmPC section 4.4 
whereby it is mentioned that Mirvaso has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; 
caution should be used in treating such patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  This  is  mentioned  in  the  SmPC  section  4.5. 
Concomitant treatment with other rosacea products is addressed in the clinical part of the assessment 
report. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Brimonidine tartrate is a selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist that is approximately 1000-fold 
more selective for the alpha2-adrenoreceptor than the alpha1-adrenoreceptor. It is expected to offer a 
positive effect on reducing cutaneous erythema caused by vasomotor instability through direct cutaneous 
vasoconstriction.  
Natural  or  synthetic  alpha-adrenergic  receptor  agonists  can  initiate  physiological  responses  such  as 
vasoconstriction,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  blood  flow  to  associated  tissues.  There  are  two  different 
subtypes of alpha-adrenergic receptors: alpha1 and alpha2. In general, alpha 1-adrenergic receptors have 
a  wider  systemic  distribution,  and  mediate  effects  on  vascular  smooth  muscle,  myocardium,  eye, 
gastrointestinal  and  genitourinary  contractility,  whereas  alpha2-adrenergic 
gastrointestinal smooth muscle wall relaxation, fat cell lipolysis and, pertinently, peripheral arterial and 
receptors  affect 
venous vasoconstriction. The classical model of vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors anatomically divided 
alpha1 and alpha2 subtypes based on postsynaptic (alpha1) and presynaptic (alpha2) locations. Although 
this model appears to hold true for larger muscular arteries (internal diameter >1 mm), later research 
indicates that in subcutaneous tissue, vasoconstriction of small, distal resistance arteries depends mainly 
on postjunctional (postsynaptic) smooth muscle alpha2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. This observation 
is based on studies using isolated mouse tail vessels and human subcutaneous resistance arteries in an in 
vitro organ bath. This research also found that the influence of the postsynaptic alpha2 component on 
vascular  contractile  state  increases  with  decreasing  vessel  diameter  and  that  these  small  vessels 
exhibited a significant lack of response to alpha1-adrenergic agonists. Additionally, research indicating a 
selective increase in reactivity of postjunctional vascular smooth muscle alpha2-adrenergic receptors in 
the  skin  of  patients  with  scleroderma,  a  disease  in  which  abnormal  vasospasm  and  ischemic  organ 
damage are important in the pathogenesis, provides further evidence that alpha 2-receptors play a major 
role in the regulation of cutaneous vascular tone.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The Applicant has not submitted any new primary pharmacology data, which is acceptable considering 
that brimonidine tartrate is a well-known compound with 15 years of clinical experience in the treatment 
of  ocular  hypertension  and  open-angle  glaucoma.  In  subcutaneous  tissue,  vasoconstriction  of  small, 
distal  resistance  arteries  depends  mainly  on  postjunctional  (postsynaptic)  smooth  muscle 
alpha2-adrenergic  receptor  stimulation.  It  is,  thus,  possible  that  the  ability  of  brimonidine  tartrate  to 
reduce erythema is via direct vasoconstriction in the skin. 
No  specific  studies  on  secondary  pharmacological  effects  have  been  performed,  which  is  acceptable 
considering that brimonidine tartrate is a well-known compound with previous clinical experience from 
ocular use. The systemic exposure to brimonidine tartrate is in a similar range with the gel formulation 
proposed  for  marketing  compared  with  the  approved  ocular  solution  (Alphagan®).  The  proposed 
mechanism of action of brimonidine tartrate in reducing erythema is direct vasoconstriction in the skin by 
action  on  smooth  muscle  alpha2-adrenergic  receptor  stimulation.  The  systemic  exposure  after  ocular 
administration if the authorised Alphagan ® SPC in EU were followed may be lower than the systemic 
exposure reached if the recommendations of the USA Product Information were followed. USA Product 
Information recommendations were applied in the studies submitted for the present MA. 
The reasons of a lower systemic exposure could be: 1) in EU the authorised posology for Alphagan® is 
twice daily; 2) the Alphagan® EU SPC recommends that systemic absorption should be minimized by 
compressing the lachrymal sac at the medial canthus (punctual occlusion) for one minute immediately 
following the instillation of each drop. 
According  to  the  Protocols  and  Study  Reports  of  the  submitted  studies  the  manoeuvre  has  not  been 
performed. However, it is unlikely that rather small differences in the exposure could have a significant 
influence on systemic safety. 
With  the  dermal  application  there  is  some  systemic  exposure  of  brimonidine  tartrate  and  due  to  the 
alpha2-adrenergic agonist properties it would be plausible to have adverse effect due to gastrointestinal 
smooth muscle wall relaxation, fat cell lipolysis and peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other topical or systemic products for the treatment of rosacea or 
with cosmetics have not been formally studied. This is further discussed in the sections below. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A plausible mechanism of action for the pharmacological effect of brimonidine tartrate in the treatment of 
facial erythema due to rosacea has been proposed and no further data are requested. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  showed  that  the  highest  mean  systemic  plasma  exposure  (in  terms  of  Cmax) 
following  once  daily  topical  application  of  0.5%  gel  was  in  the  same  range  as  the  plasma  exposure 
following ocular single day TID administration of 0.2% solution.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology program was well designed in order to collect exposure data allowing to bridge 
to the safety database of ophthalmic brimonidine. Systemic exposure after cutaneous gel application, as 
compared to the exposure after ocular administration, both in healthy subjects and target population. The 
PK after 1 month of daily administrations was investigated in the target population. All data indicate that 
with  the  intended  commercial  0.5%  formulation,  and  with  the  proposed  once  daily  administration, 
systemic exposure to brimonidine is similar or lower than the TID ocular administration, both in terms of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 36/107 
 
  
  
Cmax and AUC. After one month of daily cutaneous administration there was no systemic accumulation of 
brimonidine.  
The low bioavailability after cutaneous administration is consistent with the physico-chemical properties 
of the drug, which is freely soluble in water and insoluble in organic solvents. The lack of accumulation is 
consistent  with  the  reported  half-life  of  brimonidine,  which  is  approximately  3  h  after  ocular 
administration (Alphagan® SPC).  
The CHMP agrees that the data that have been presented for the evaluation of the medicinal product are 
sufficient, and have no more outstanding issues. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The efficacy claims for Mirvaso are based mainly upon six clinical studies; three phase 2 studies, two 
pivotal phase 3 studies and one open-label, long-term phase 3 study. 
Study COL-118-ROSE-201 
This  early  study  evaluated  the  dose-response  relationship  and  pharmacodynamic  profile  of  three 
concentrations of Brimonidine tartrate gel (0.02%, 0.07%, and 0.2%) and vehicle gel applied to the face 
of  subjects  with  rosacea.  The  treatment  duration  was  29 days.  Subjects  with  moderate  to  severe 
categories  of  rosacea  based  on  CEA,  IGA,  and  CTG  scores  were  eligible  for  the  study.  The  intended 
to-be-marketed concentration of Brimonidine tartrate gel (0.5%) was not evaluated and the study used 
different endpoints and different versions of efficacy assessments compared to subsequent studies. 
The primary endpoint, reduction in erythema using the CEA score, across all time points (0 to 8 hours) 
and  all  visits  (Day  0,  Day  14,  and  Day  28)  showed  a  dose-response  relationship.  Both  the  0.2%  and 
0.07%  groups  had  significantly  greater  changes  from  Baseline  than  the  vehicle  group  (p<0.0001 and 
p<0.05, respectively).  
Although,  the  results  showed  a  dose-response  relationship  for  the  CEA  score  for  the  studied 
concentrations.  This  study  did  not  include  the  final,  commercial  0.5%  concentration  of  Brimonidine 
Tartrate Gel and is thus, of limited interest for the assessment. 
Study RD.06.SRE.18144 
Study  RD.06.SRE.18144  was  a  Phase  2a  single-dose,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group, 
vehicle-controlled, dose-response study in subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea. 
Subjects were randomized to receive Brimonidine Tartrate Gel (0.5%, 0.18%, or 0.07%) or Vehicle Gel. 
Subjects were observed for a 12-hour period following application of the study drug.  Study endpoints 
included  time  to  the  first  1-grade  and  2-grade  improvements  on  the  CEA  and  PSA  and  evaluation  of 
chromameter data at each time point. 
A  total  of  122 subjects,  comprising  the  ITT  Population,  were  randomized  to  the  following  treatment 
groups:  Brimonidine  Tartrate  0.5%  Gel  (31 subjects),  Brimonidine  Tartrate  0.18%  Gel  (31 subjects), 
Brimonidine Tartrate 0.07% Gel (28 subjects), and Vehicle Gel (32 subjects). All 122 subjects completed 
the  study.  A  total  of  117 subjects  were  included  in  the  PP  Population.  The  majority  of  subjects  were 
female  (75.4%)  and  Caucasian  (91.8%)  and  the  mean  age  was  45.7 years.  There  were  no  clinically 
meaningful differences in baseline or demographic characteristics. A statistically significant difference in 
baseline PSA scores was observed; however, the difference is not likely to be clinically meaningful.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014

The response rate for 2-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA showed a dose-related trend ranging 
from  25.0%  of  subjects  in  the  Brimonidine  Tartrate  0.07%  Gel  group  to  54.8%  of  subjects  in  the 
Brimonidine  Tartrate  0.5%  Gel  group,  compared  to  12.5%  of  subjects  in  the  Vehicle  Gel  group.  The 
results showed a dose-response relationship for the CEA and PSA scores. 
This dose-ordering effect was also observed for 1-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA ranging from 
75.0% of subjects in the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.07% Gel group to 83.9% of subjects in the Brimonidine 
Tartrate 0.5% Gel group, compared to 28.1% of subjects in the Vehicle Gel group. 
Assessment of erythema was also made with a chromameter, which provides an objective measure of 
skin redness and these results were in agreement with the CEA and PSA results. 
A  dose-response  relationship  in  reduction  of  erythema  (redness),  as  measured  by  chromameter  was 
shown during the 12-hour treatment interval between the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel 
groups. 
No clinically relevant deterioration of telangiectasia or worsening of inflammatory lesions was observed in 
any treatment group.  
Based on these study results, both the 0.18%, and 0.5% concentrations of Brimonidine Tartrate Gel were 
selected for evaluation in the Phase 2b efficacy and safety study (18161). 
Study RD.06.SRE.18161 
Study RD.06.SRE.18161 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, multi-center 
study investigating the efficacy and safety of CD07805/47 gel in concentrations of 0.5% applied topically 
once  daily  (QD),  and  0.18%  applied  topically  once  daily  (QD)  or  twice  daily  (BID),  in  subjects  with 
moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea. The treatment period was 29 days, followed 
by 4 weeks of additional treatment-free follow-up. The study was conducted in the US in 2010. 
Subjects were randomized to receive Brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel QD, 0.18% Gel BID, 0.18% Gel QD, 
Vehicle Gel BID or Vehicle Gel QD. Subjects were assessed during a 12-hour post-dose observation and 
evaluation period on Baseline/Day 1, Day 15, and Day 29. On non-clinic days (Days 2-14 and 16-28) 
subjects were to apply study drug as directed and to complete daily self-assessments. Subjects were to 
return  to  the  investigational  centres  during  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period  at  Day  30,  Week  5, 
Week 6, and Week 8. 
The sample size determination for this study was based on the results from Study 18144. A sample size 
of 260 (52 per arm) was estimated to be sufficient to detect the specified treatment difference of 25% 
(35% vs. 10%) in Composite Success with a statistical power of 90% when conducted as a two-sided test 
at the 5% significance level. 
The primary analyses were to test differences between each active treatment (0.5% QD, 0.18% BID, and 
0.18% QD) versus the corresponding vehicle gel on the correlated repeated measurements for Composite 
Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29 using the GEE methodology in the ITT Population. The logit 
link function was used to model the marginal expectation. The LOCF method was used to handle missing 
data and three different sensitivity analyses were performed.  
The primary efficacy endpoints were 2-grade Composite Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29, then 
on Day 15 and lastly on Day 1, where a 2-grade Composite Success was defined as 2-grade improvement 
from Baseline (T0 at Day 1) on both CEA and PSA-5 at each time point. 
Several secondary end-points were included, e.g. 1-grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA-5; CEA 
Success (defined as 2-grade improvement from Baseline on CEA), 1-grade CEA Success; PSA-5 Success 
Assessment report

(defined as 2-grade improvement from Baseline on PSA-5); 1-grade PSA-5 Success, all assessed at Hours 
3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 1, Day 15, and Day 29. Other end-points were assessments of PAA and OTE. 
Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the course of the study and assessments of vital signs 
and physical examinations were performed. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed to 
control for possible occurrence of ocular hypotension, defined as IOP less than 10 mmHg (normal range 
10 to 21 mmHg).  
Results 
A  total  of  269 subjects,  comprising  the  ITT  Population,  were  randomized  to  the  treatment  groups: 
Brimonidine  Tartrate 0.5%  Gel  QD  (53 subjects),  Brimonidine  tartrate 0.18%  Gel  BID  (54 subjects), 
Brimonidine  tartrate 0.18%  Gel  QD  (54 subjects),  Vehicle  gel  BID  (53 subjects),  and  Vehicle  gel  QD 
(55 subjects).  A  total  of  237 subjects  were  included  in  the  PP  Population.  There  were  no  clinically 
meaningful or statistically significant differences in baseline or demographic characteristics among the 
treatment groups. The study population comprised mainly female subjects (>80%), aged about 45 years 
and >96% were Caucasians. 
Both  the  Brimonidine  tartrate 0.18%  gel  BID  and  Brimonidine  tartrate 0.18%  gel  QD  groups  showed 
numerical  effectiveness  against  their  respective  vehicle  gel  controls,  however,  the  results  were  not 
statistically significant and superiority over the corresponding Vehicle gel controls (BID or QD) was not 
observed  in  most  instances.  Brimonidine  tartrate 0.5%  Gel  QD  was  therefore  shown  to  be  the  most 
effective concentration and dosing regimen among the 3 Brimonidine tartrate gel treatment groups.

Figure 1. 2-grade Composite Success during treatment, Study 18161, LOCF, ITT Population 
Study SRE.18161 showed a statistically significant treatment effect for Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel on 
the reduction of facial erythema of rosacea as assessed by the investigators and by the subjects (CEA and 
PSA) within a 29-day treatment period. Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel QD was the most effective 
concentration and dosing regimen among the three Brimonidine Tartrate Gel treatment groups. 
Brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel QD was significantly superior (p<0.001) compared to vehicle gel QD by the 
primary analysis (2-grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA-5 at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29). Two 
(2)-grade  Composite  Success  ranged  from  18.9%  to  32.1%  on  Day  29 compared  to  the  Vehicle  Gel 
control, which ranged from 3.6% to 7.3%. Statistical superiority of Brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel QD 
versus Vehicle gel QD was also demonstrated on Days 15 and Day 1 (p<0.001). Results for the primary 
endpoint were confirmed in the PP Population and in sensitivity analyses. The 2-grade Composite Success 
rate for the 0.5% gel ranged from 19% to 32% on Day 29, which are quite modest numbers, although 
significantly higher compared to the Vehicle Gel control ranging from 3.6% to 7.3%. 
Composite  Success  assessed  as  1-grade  improvement  on  both  CEA  and  PSA  for  Brimonidine  tartrate 
0.5% Gel QD ranged from 60.4% to 75.5% on Day 29 compared to Vehicle Gel control, which ranged 
from 30.9% to 41.8%. As with the primary endpoint, the difference between Brimonidine tartrate 0.5% 
gel QD and the corresponding Vehicle Gel control for this endpoint was statistically significant on Day 
29 (Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12), as well as on Day 15, and Day 1 (p<0.001 for all days).  
No  evidence  of  tachyphylaxis  of  the  treatment  effect  was  observed.  Efficacy  profiles  for  Day  29 were 
comparable  to  or  slightly  better  than  Day  1 profiles,  indicating  no  reduction  in  effectiveness  over  the 
course of the treatment phase of the study. 
After cessation of treatment, no aggravation (rebound) of subject’s facial erythema (based on the CEA or 
PSA) was observed in any Brimonidine tartrate gel group compared to Baseline/Day 1 (T0) erythema 
levels. In the Brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel group, the mean reductions in CEA scores ranged from 0.6 to 
0.7 points and the mean reductions in PSA scores ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 points relative to Day 1/Hour 
0 across  the  4 follow-up  visits.  In  addition,  no  worsening  of  the  IGA  of  Lesions,  increasing  facial 
inflammatory lesion counts, or worsening of the TGA was observed during the 4-week follow-up period in 
the Brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel group.

The brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel QD treatment group also showed the most favourable outcome with 
respect  to  PAA  and  OTE,  compared  to  either  the  Brimonidine  tartrate 0.18%  Gel  BID  group  or  the 
Brimonidine tartrate 0.18% gel QD group, and the corresponding vehicle controls.  
In  the  brimonidine  tartrate 0.5%  gel  QD  group,  unwanted  over-whitening  (based  on  the  PAW)  was 
highest on Day 1 (up to 19% bothered by over-whitening at some time point) and the trend for unwanted 
over-whitening  in  the  Brimonidine  tartrate  0.5%  gel  QD  group  decreased  over  time.  By  Day  29,  the 
number of subjects reporting unwanted over-whitening was lower (<10% bothered by over-whitening for 
the 0.5% gel at all time-points).  
Based on the results of the studies described above, the 0.5% concentration of Brimonidine Tartrate Gel 
administered once daily was selected for the Phase 3 studies. Concentrations higher than 0.5% or BID 
application of the 0.5% gel have not been studied. The decision to go for the 0.5% QD posology was also 
based on pharmacokinetic results, since a higher gel concentration or BID application may result in too 
high systemic exposure to brimonidine. The rationale for not selecting the concentrations and/or dose 
regimens that would achieve a maximal effect (2-grade improvement) for the maximum daily duration 
(up to 12 hours) was to maintain an optimized benefit/risk ratio for the product and to avoid excessive 
unwanted pharmacodynamic effects (such as “over-whitening”).  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The two pivotal studies in the application are 18140 and 18141, with an identical design. These studies 
were conducted in parallel (the first subject in each study was enrolled on 16 May 2011).  
The studies were of multicentre, randomized double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group design with 
the aim to demonstrate the efficacy and assess the safety of CD07805/47 Gel 0.5% applied topically once 
daily in subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea. 
Since  the  pivotal  studies  had  an  identical  design,  the  methods  are  not  described  for  each  study 
separately. The efficacy results were not pooled and therefore the results of the studies are presented for 
each study separately.

Treatments 
The  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  either  CD07805/47  gel  0.5%  or  vehicle  gel  administered 
topically once daily for 29 days on the face. Other rosacea treatments were not allowed. The vehicle gel 
Assessment report

has a composition identical to the active CD07805/47 0.5% gel, without the active substance brimonidine 
tartrate. All other components of the formulation remained the same. 
Subjects  were  instructed  not  to  apply  study  drug  prior  to  arriving  at  the  investigational  center  on 
assessment days. At each clinic visit, efficacy and safety assessments were to be performed prior to T0. 
Subjects were then to apply the study drug under investigational center personnel supervision. 
On  non-clinic  days  (Days  2-14  and  16-28),  subjects  were  to  apply  approximately  one  small  pea  size 
amount of gel on each of the following facial regions once daily in the morning after washing the entire 
face:  right  cheek,  left  cheek,  forehead,  chin,  and  nose.  Application  on  the  eyes,  eyelids,  inner  nose, 
mouth, and lips was to be avoided and so was application of study drug to severely irritated skin or open 
lesions. The amount of study drug to be applied was approximately 1 gram. No dose modification was 
allowed during the course of the study. 
Study procedures: 
Subjects who met the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria at Screening and at the Baseline/Day 1 clinic visit were 
randomized to receive study drug for a period of 4 weeks. Following the 4-week dosing period, subjects 
returned  to  the  investigational  centres  on  Week  6  and  Week  8/Early  Termination  (ET)  for  follow-up 
evaluations. 
Subject assessments were performed at the investigational center during a 12-hour post-dose evaluation 
period on Day 1, Day 15, and Day 29. On non-clinic days (Days 2-14 and 16-28) subjects were to apply 
study drug as directed and to complete daily subject assessments. 
Subjects  were  required  to  complete  various  self-assessments  during  the  study.  Subjects  were  to 
complete the PSA at each study visit, including the non-clinic days (Days 2-14 and 16-28) and during the 
follow-up period. The Patient Assessment of Appearance (PAA) and the Patient Assessment of Whitening 
(PAW) assessments were to be completed on Days 1, 15, and 29, and on non-clinic days (Days 2-14 and 
16-28). Subjects were to complete the SF-12v2™ Acute Health Survey on Days 1, 15, 29, and at each 
follow-up visit. Subjects were to complete the Productivity and Social Life Questionnaire on Days 1 and 29 
and  at  the  Week  8/ET  Follow-up  visit.  The  Overall  Treatment  Effect  (OTE)  assessment  was  to  be 
completed on Day 29.  
The Investigator/evaluator (a board-certified dermatologist) was to complete the CEA at each clinic visit, 
including during the screening and follow-up periods; the Telangiectasia Grading Assessment (TGA) on 
Day 1, Day 29, and each follow-up visit; a facial inflammatory lesion count at each clinic visit (except Day 
15); and the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Lesions on Day 1, Day 29, and each follow-up 
visit. Whenever possible, the same Investigator/evaluator who performed the initial assessments was to 
perform the assessments for each individual subject for the entire duration of the study.  
The patients arrived at the investigational center 1 hour prior to study drug application to allow for proper 
acclimation  to  the  investigational  center  environment.  Efficacy  and  safety  assessments  were  to  be 
completed within 10 minutes of the scheduled time point. 
In the protocol, it is stated that on clinic visit days, subjects were to wash their face with water and their 
routine mild facial cleanser. After washing, subjects should follow instructions for study drug application 
and not apply anything else to their face that day. On non-clinic days, subjects could use facial products 
such as lotions, creams, ointments, cosmetics, and sunscreens, unless specifically excluded. Study drug 
should be applied prior to any other facial product.

Objectives 
The objectives of the pivotal phase 3 studies were to demonstrate the efficacy and to assess safety of 
CD07805/47 gel 0.5%, applied topically once daily for 4 weeks versus vehicle control, in the treatment of 
moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The end-points in studies 18140 and 18141 were the following: 
Table 16. End-points in studies 18140 and 18141 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
2-grade Composite Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, 12 on Day 29, then on Day 15 and lastly on Day 1, with 2-grade 
Composite Success defined as a 2-grade improvement on both CEA and PSA at each time point. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
30-minute Effect, defined as 1-grade Composite Success (1-grade improvement on both CEA and PSA) at 
30 minutes on Day 1. 
Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints 
1-grade Composite Success at Hour 3, 6, 9, 12 on Day 29, Day 15, and Day 1; 1-grade Composite Success was defined as 
1-grade improvement on CEA and PSA. 
2-grade CEA Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29, Day 15 and Day 1; 2-grade CEA Success was defined as 2-grade 
improvement on CEA. 
2-grade PSA Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29, Day 15 and Day 1; 2-grade PSA Success was defined as 2-grade 
improvement on PSA. 
Percentage of Days with PSA scored ‘0’ or ‘1’ between visits. 
Change in Pre-dose CEA from Baseline (T0 on Day 1) at each post-Baseline visit during treatment and follow-up phases. 
Change in Pre-dose PSA from Baseline (T0 on Day 1) at each post-Baseline visit during treatment and follow-up phases. 
Other Endpoints 
Change in PAA from Baseline (T0 at Day 1) at Hours 3, 6, 9, 12 on Day 29, Day 15, and Day 1 
Percentage of Days with PAA scored ‘0’ or ‘1’ between visits 
OTE on Day 29 
Change in IGA of Lesions from Baseline (T0 at Day 1) on Day 29, and at follow-up 
Change from Baseline in facial inflammatory lesion counts on Day 29 and at Follow-up visit 
Change in TGA from Baseline (T0 at Day 1) on Day 29, and at Follow-up visit 
PAW at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29, Day 15, and Day 1 
Percentage of Days with PAW scored ‘yes’ for Whitening, and scored ‘yes’ for bothered by the whitening between visits 
Change from Baseline in SF-12v2 Acute Health Survey data on Day 15, Day 29 and Follow-up visit 
Change from Baseline in Productivity and Social Life Questionnaire on Day 29 and Follow-up visit. 
Safety assessments included recording of AEs, laboratory safety tests (blood chemistry, haematology, 
urinalysis) vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) and physical examinations. 
Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) was not measured in the pivotal studies. 
The primary efficacy end-point was a composite end-point including both the clinicians and the patient’s 
assessments of erythema (CEA and PSA, respectively). A 2-grade improvement on both the CEA and PSA 
scales was required for success to be concluded at each time point. Thus, the criteria for meeting the 
primary end-point were set quite high.  
The secondary efficacy end-point aimed to assess the onset of efficacy, by assessing a 1-grade Composite 
Success (1-grade improvement on both CEA and PSA) at 30 minutes on Day 1. 
A large number of tertiary and other end-points were also included.

Sample size 
The sample size determinations for the Phase 3 pivotal studies were based on the results from the phase 
2b Study (RD.06.SRE.18161). Considering the variability and vehicle effect could have potentially been 
higher  in  the  Phase  3  studies,  it  was  assumed  that  the  underlying  treatment  difference  in  Composite 
Success rate between brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel was 15%, the vehicle effect was 
10%, the correlation between repeated measurements was 0.7, and the expected dropout rate was 10%. 
A  sample  size  of  260  (130  per  arm)  was  estimated  to  be  sufficient  to  detect  the  specified  treatment 
difference of 15% (25% vs. 10%) in Composite Success with a statistical power of 90% when conducted 
as a two-sided test at the 5% significance level. 
Randomisation 
Approximately  260  subjects  for  each  study  were  to  be  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
CD07805/47  gel  0.5%  or  vehicle  gel  for  once  daily  application.  The  randomisation  was  stratified  by 
centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  randomization  list  was  to  be  secured  in  a  locked  cabinet  and/or  an  electronic  file  with  restricted 
access until the database was locked. Investigators and/or subject evaluators were not to be permitted 
access to the randomization list.  
Active  CD07805/47  gel  and  vehicle  gel  were  identical  in  appearance  to  each  other  and  no  visible 
differences could be observed between the study drugs.  Active CD07805/47 gel and  vehicle gel were 
packed in identical tubes. The procedures used to ensure blinding seem acceptable. It should be borne in 
mind  that  due  to  the  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  CD07805/47  gel,  the  vasoconstriction  results  in 
blanching  effect  of  the  skin,  which  is  visibly  detected  by  the  patients.  Thus,  maintaining  blinding  can 
obviously  be  difficult  for  this  kind  of  product  due  to  the  desired  clinical  effect.  The  PSA  and  other 
end-points are rated by the patients themselves whereas other end-points such as CEA are rated by the 
clinician, who is blinded to treatment. If un-blinding due to observation of the effect by the patient was 
obvious, larger effects on PSA vs. the CEA scales over time could be expected. No un-blinding took place. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods are overall acceptable. 
Endpoints 
Using only one time-point for the baseline assessments of CEA and PSA and 4 time-points at follow-up 
assessments (Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 after treatment) makes it difficult to assess the time course of effect 
during the day. A baseline curve covering the same time points of the day without treatment would have 
been of interest in order to evaluate whether the degree of erythema shows a diurnal variation, e.g. an 
increased intensity at later time points of the day. However, the vehicle arm may to some extent account 
for this. 
Analysis of Primary Variable 
The primary analyses tested the hypothesis of no treatment difference between active treatment and 
vehicle on the correlated repeated measurements for Composite Success at Hours 3, 6, 9 and 12 on Day 
29  using  the  Generalized  Estimating  Equation  (GEE)  methodology  in  the  ITT  Population.  Tests  of 
treatment  effects  were  also  performed  on  Day  15  and  Day  1  using  GEE  methodology.  The  logit  link 
function  was  used  to  model  the  marginal  expectation.  The  GEE  method  requires  specification  of  the 
structure for the underlying correlation matrix, and the m-dependent (m=3) matrix was used for the data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 45/107 
 
  
  
 
in the Phase 3 pivotal studies due to lack of convergence using the unstructured correlation matrix. The 
dependent variable in the model was Composite Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 and the independent 
variables were treatment, analysis centre, and time points (Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12). 
The primary analyses were performed based on the ITT Population, and were repeated based on the PP 
Population and the MITT population in the 18141 study to confirm the ITT results. 
Subgroup summaries for 2-grade Composite Success by gender, age group (18-64 vs. 65 and above) and 
race (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian) were provided by descriptive statistics. 
Handling of Missing Data 
The multiple imputation (MI) procedure was the primary imputation method to handle missing CEA or PSA 
data at any time point (Hours 3, 6, 9, or 12) for the primary endpoint. Instead of filling in a single value 
for each missing value, the MI procedure replaced each missing CEA and PSA value with a set of plausible 
values that represented the uncertainty about the value to impute. 
In addition to the MI procedure, 3 sensitivity analyses were applied to 2-grade Composite Success at 4 
time points (Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12) as follows: (a) imputing ‘Failure’ for any missing data, (b) imputing 
‘Success’ for any missing data, and (c) using the average score of the available data at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 
12  on  CEA  and  PSA  to  impute  ‘Success’  or  ‘Failure’  accordingly.  In  addition,  last  observation  carried 
forward (LOCF) methodology was used as a sensitivity analysis. 
Because observed data were used for the secondary endpoint, tertiary endpoints, and other assessments, 
missing data were not imputed. 
Analysis of Secondary Variable 
The secondary endpoint of 30-minute Effect was analysed by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test 
stratified by analysis centre, with the general association statistic. 
Control of Type I Error 
In the Phase 3 pivotal studies, Type I error (alpha) was strictly controlled by clearly pre-specifying the 
primary variable, primary time point, primary analysis methodology, and primary population (2-grade 
Composite Success, Day 29, GEE with MI, and ITT). The experiment-wise alpha was further controlled by 
the pre-specification of hierarchical testing of earlier time points: Day 15 and then Day 1. Following the 
testing of the primary variable the test of hypotheses was limited to the testing of only one secondary 
variable: 30-minute Effect.

Table 18. Summary of Subject Disposition, ITT Population Study (18140) 
To address a concern about data validity at a single investigational center (8283) in study 18141, the 
MITT Population was defined as the ITT Population excluding all subjects from that investigational center. 
All efficacy analyses were to be performed for the MITT Population to validate the results.

Table 20. Summary of Subject Disposition, ITT Population (Study 18141) 
The number of subjects completing the studies was high (>96%) in both pivotal studies.  
Recruitment 
Both studies were initiated the 16 May 2011 and study 18140 was completed on 23 September 2011 and 
study 18141 on 22 November 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 15 investigational centres located in the US and Canada enrolled subjects in both studies. 
Two amendments to the study protocol were prepared for study 18140, related to for instance the 
exclusion criteria, previous and concomitant therapies and vital signs and safety laboratory testing. The 
same amendments were made for study 18141. 
One amendment to the SAP, dated 16 January 2012, was prepared for study 18141 prior to unblinding. 
The changes included definition of a modified ITT Population (MITT), defined as the ITT Population 
excluding all subjects of the investigational center 8283 for which data validity concerns were discovered. 
The ITT analyses remained primary, though. Furthermore, changes in the primary efficacy analyses 
model without treatment-by-center interaction term were made. 
The amendments to the protocol are not considered to have an impact on the evaluation of the results. 
Baseline data 
There  were  no  major  differences  between  the  active  treatment  and  the  vehicle  groups  in  baseline 
characteristics in the two pivotal studies.  
The  majority  of  included  subjects  were  females  (>70%)  with  a  mean  age  in  the  range  45-50  years. 
Almost only Caucasian or white subjects were included. Most subjects had a Fitzpatrick skin phototype of 
II or III, but some subjects in the categories with lighter or darker skin types were included as well. It is 
not  unexpected  that  mainly  fair-skinned  subjects  are  those  mainly  affected  by  rosacea  with  facial 
erythema. 
The subjects included had PSA and CEA scores of 3 or 4, in accordance with the inclusion criteria (with 
one exception in study 18140 due to a protocol violation). Thus, subjects with moderate to severe facial 
erythema were included although the majority (generally >80%) had moderate erythema. 
Numbers analysed 
Major protocol deviations that resulted in subjects being excluded from the PP Population are summarized 
in Table 21 and Table 22.

Table 21. Summary of Subjects Excluded from the Per-protocol Population, ITT Population (Study 18140) 
In study 18140, administrative error was the most common deviation, which was reported for 18 
subjects, and was due to a sub-Investigator at a single investigative center who had not completed the 
CEA harmonization training prior to conducting the CEA evaluation on those subjects.  Non-compliance, 
defined as a dosing deviation of more than 30% of planned doses, was also common, mainly due to 
subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study. 
Table 22. Summary of Subjects Excluded from the Per-protocol Population, ITT Population (Study 18141) 
In study 18141, site-specific data validity concern was the most common deviation, which was reported 
for 33 subjects: 17 in the CD07805/47 Gel 0.5% group and 16 in the Vehicle Gel group. The specific 
concern was raised for the data from a single investigational center (8283). 
A total of 12 subjects, 6 in each treatment group, were excluded from the PP Population due to 
non-compliance, which included dosing deviations of more than 30% of planned doses, mainly due to 
premature discontinuation from the study. A total of 5 subjects were excluded from the PP Population due 
to entrance criteria deviations, all of which were due to insufficient washout periods. 
No major concerns arise, except for the issue related to data validity concerns for one center in study 
18141. The reason for the “site-specific data validity concern” in study 18141 was study coordinator 
admission of falsification of vital sign data for one subject. Conservatively, all subjects at this site were 
being classified as major deviators and excluded from the PP population.

Outcomes and estimation

2-grade Composite Success: 2-grade improvement on CEA and 2-grade improvement on PSA. 
In both pivotal studies, CD07805/47 Gel 0.5% was significantly superior (p<0.001) compared to Vehicle 
Gel for the primary endpoint (2-grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 
29). Statistical superiority of CD07805/47 Gel 0.5% versus Vehicle Gel was also demonstrated on Day 15 
(p<0.001) and Day 1 (p<0.001).  
The results were confirmed in the ITT Population using the LOCF method, in the MITT population (in Study 
18141) and the PP Population, and in the sensitivity analyses. 
There was a tendency to an increased response across days 1, 15 and 29 both in the active and vehicle gel 
treated groups. On day 29, the vehicle response was approximately 10% and for brimonidine tartrate 
0.5% Gel, the response at different time points ranged between 17.6% and 31.5%. The highest response 
was observed at the 3 and 6 hour time points and the effect tended to wear off at the later time points. 
For completeness, results for the MITT population (excluding center 8283) for study 18141 are presented 
below. 
Table 24. Summary of 2-grade Composite Success, Observed Data, MITT Population, study 18141 
As described above, a data validity concern was raised for the data from a single investigational center 
(8283), and a modified ITT population was defined. A clear statistically significant difference between

CD07805/47 0.5% Gel and Vehicle gel is observed irrespective of analysis population (ITT, MITT, and PP). 
Looking at efficacy results for the primary end-point from this center, it can be noted that the 2-grade 
success  rate  in  the  vehicle  group  was  0%  at  all  days  and  time  points.  The  response  rate  in  the 
CD07805/47 0.5% Gel group tended to be somewhat higher at several time points than in the overall 
population, with success rates ranging from 12 up to 53%. The complete lack of response in the vehicle 
group is somewhat remarkable. Complete lack of response at all-time points for the Vehicle Gel group was 
in fact also observed at 2 additional centres in study 18141 and also in 3 centres in study 18140. Although 
this could be due to normal variation, it could also indicate problems related to blinding. The applicant was 
asked to discuss this finding and analyse the efficacy data from both studies without these centres.  
The  requested  analyses  were  provided  with  exclusion  of  sites  for  which  none  of  the  vehicle  subjects 
achieved 2-grade Composite Success on Day 29. This concerned a fairly large number of sites (a total of 
12 out of 30). Still, statistical significance vs. vehicle was maintained for all comparisons, except for the 
Day 29 results in study 18141. It is agreed that with an anticipated 10% incidence of 2-grade Composite 
Success  in  the  vehicle  group  it  is  not  unlikely  that  there  would  be  several  sites  without  any  vehicle 
subjects achieving 2-grade Composite Success.  
Secondary end-point 
The secondary endpoint evaluated the early effect of treatment (30-minute Effect) assessed as a 1-grade 
improvement on CEA and 1-grade improvement on PSA at 30 minutes post dosing.

1-grade Composite Success: 1-grade improvement on CEA and 1-grade improvement on PSA. 
The 1-grade Composite Success profile was statistically significant (p<0.001) on Days 1, 15, and 29 in 
the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel group compared to subjects who received Vehicle Gel. The results for 
1-grade Composite Success on Day 29 ranged from 53.5% to 71% and the vehicle effect was around 30% 
in study 18140 and 40% in study 18141 at Day 29. Thus, the percentage of patients reaching 1-grade 
Composite Success was clearly higher than those reaching 2-grade Composite Success. As for the 
2-grade Composite Success, the vehicle effect and to some extent also the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel 
effect tended to increase somewhat over time.

Mean changes in CEA scores  
The mean changes in CEA scores on Days 1, 15, and 29 are graphically depicted in Figures 8. The 
differences between the active and vehicle group mean responses were largest at Hour 3 on Days 1, 15, 
and 29, with some tapering off by Hour 12; although the data at Hour 12 showed approximately 1-grade 
improvement in mean scores relative to Hour 0.

Patient Assessment of Appearance (PAA) 
The subject’s self-assessments of satisfaction with the overall appearance of their facial skin were based 
on the 5-grade PAA scale. At the end of the treatment period (Day 29/Hour 12), greater proportions of 
subjects  in  the  brimonidine  tartrate  0.5%  Gel  group  in  each  study  reported  being  satisfied  or  very 
satisfied with their appearance compared to subjects in the corresponding Vehicle Gel groups.

In Study 18140, the Day 15 visit for Subject 8026-002 was on Day 17; therefore, the Day 2-16 and Day 18-28 diary data were summarized in Day 
2-14 (between Day 1 and Day 15) and Day 16-28 (between Day 15 and Day 29) instead. 
Overall Treatment Effect (OTE) 
Subject self-assessments of the overall impact of therapy on the management of their facial erythema 
relative to the beginning of the study were based on the OTE. The OTE assessments were completed on 
Day 29 at 12 hours after the first application of study drug. The data for the OTE, as assessed by subjects 
at Hour 12 on Day 29, are summarized below.

Quality of life assessment results 
The Phase 3 pivotal studies included QOL assessments based on the SF-12v2 Acute Health Survey and 
the Productivity and Social Life Questionnaire.  
The SF-12v2 Acute Health Survey Scale/Component Score assessment was completed at predose (Hour 
0) on Days 1, 15, 29 and during the Week 6 and Week 8 follow-up visits. No notable differences were 
observed in the mean scores on the various domains in either study between subjects in the brimonidine 
tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel groups on Days 1, 15, or 29.  
The  Productivity  and  Social  Life  Questionnaire  assessment  was  completed  at  Hour  12 on  Days  1 and 
29 and  during  the  Week  8 follow-up  visit.  As  for  the  SF-12v2  Acute  Health  Survey,  no  notable 
differences were observed between subjects in the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel groups 
in either study at any time point.  
The  Patient  Assessment  of  Appearance  (PAA),  Overall  Treatment  Effect  (OTE)  and  Quality  of  life 
assessments are different subject self-assessments of the treatment results.  
For the PAA, less than 10% of the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel treated subjects were very satisfied with 
their  appearance  at  Day  29/Hour  12,  while  30-35%  were  satisfied  with  their  appearance.  In  the 
corresponding  Vehicle  Gel  groups,  a  total  of  about  20%  were  satisfied  or  very  satisfied  with  their 
appearance. The number of subjects being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied at Day 29/Hour 12 were higher 
for the vehicle gel, however, quite large numbers of subjects in the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel groups 
were also dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their appearance on the last treatment day. 
For the OTE, higher percentages of subjects in the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel group assessed the 
management  of  their  facial  erythema  since  starting  the  study  as  “Moderately  better”  or  “Very  much 
better” (40-45%) as a result of the treatment compared to subjects in the respective Vehicle Gel groups 
(less than 20%). The mean OTE scores were similar between treatment groups, though. 
Of note is that for the three categories indicating worsening, about 10% of subjects in the brimonidine 
tartrate  0.5%  Gel  group  assessed,  the  management  of  their  facial  erythema  as  worse  compared  to 
subjects  in  the  respective  Vehicle  Gel  groups  (3-5%).  Thus,  twice  as  many  subjects  in  the  active 
treatment  group  considered  that  their  condition  had  worsened  as  a  result  of  treatment.  This  was, 
however, not reflected in the CEA and PSA results, since the number of patients experiencing a 1-grade 
impairment was lower in the active vs. the vehicle group 
For the Quality of life assessments, no notable differences could be observed between the Brimonidine 
Tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel groups in either of the two scales at any time point. These scales do not 
seem to be of particular relevance for the assessment of QOL in a condition like rosacea. For instance for 
the Productivity and Social Life Questionnaire, the majority of subjects responded at baseline that their 
rosacea did not affect their productivity at work or daily activities, or that they avoided public contact or 
cancelled social engagement because of rosacea. Thus, since the rosacea did not seem to have major 
impact on their lives, an effect of treatment is not to be expected. 
Investigator’s Global Assessment of Lesions and inflammatory lesion count results 
Facial inflammatory lesions associated with rosacea were evaluated based on IGA of Lesions and facial 
inflammatory lesion counts. Subjects with 3 or more inflammatory lesions at Baseline were not eligible for 
inclusion in the studies. The IGA of Lesions and facial inflammatory lesion counts were performed on Day 
1 at predose (T0), on Day 29 at Hour 1-2, and during the follow-up period (Day 30 and Week 5 in Study 
18161 and Week 6 and Week 8 in all 3 studies). These assessments were intended to determine whether 
treatment of erythema resulted in a worsening of lesions.

A summary of the IGA of Lesions scores in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 pivotal studies during the treatment 
and follow-up periods is provided in the table below. In each of the studies, the Baseline scores were 
similar between the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel groups and no significant worsening in 
the mean IGA of Lesions scores was observed at Hour 12 on Day 29 or during the follow-up period.

Regarding facial inflammatory lesion counts, the baseline assessments were similar between the treatment groups. Only very small increases in 
facial inflammatory lesion counts from baseline were observed in the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel and vehicle gel groups at Day 29. No 
significant worsening in mean lesion counts was observed during the post-treatment follow-up period (weeks 6 and 8).  
Telangiectasia Grading Assessment (TGA) 
Telangiectasia’s were evaluated based on the TGA performed on Day 1 at predose (T0), on Day 29 at

Patient Assessment of Whitening (PAW) 
The subjects completed self-assessments of potential over-extended pharmacodynamic effect of the 
study drug based on the PAW. The assessments were completed by subjects on Day 1, Day 15, and Day 
29 at pre-dose (T0), and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after the first application of study drug. Between study 
visits (Days 2-14 and Days 16-28), the PAW was completed QD just before bedtime. 
The PAW scores on Days 1, 15, and 29 in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 pivotal studies are summarized below. 
Higher percentages of subjects in the Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel groups in each study reported being 
bothered by too much whitening compared to the corresponding Vehicle Gel groups. The trend for 
unwanted over-whitening levelled out over the course of the treatment phase in each study.

The  percentage  of  days  that  subjects  reported  too  much  whitening  and  being  bothered  by  too  much 
whitening  between  visits  (Days  2 to  14 and  Days  16 to  28)  are  summarized  below.  Similar  to  the 
observed data for clinic visits, subjects in the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel group tended to report a 
higher percentage of days with too much whitening and being bothered by too much whitening compared 
to subjects in the Vehicle Gel group.

Facial inflammatory lesions and telangiectasias are symptoms of rosacea that are not considered specific 
targets of the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel treatment, however, assessment of these symptoms is of 
interest to evaluate whether any worsening would occur. 
Regarding facial inflammatory lesions, the protocols for the pivotal studies stipulated that subjects with 
3 or more inflammatory lesions at Baseline were not eligible for inclusion in the studies. Based on the 
results at Day 29 and at follow-up visits, no worsening of facial inflammatory lesions seemed to have 
occurred as a result of treatment. 
Regarding telangiectasias, most subjects had mild or moderate telangiectasias at baseline. The mean 
scores had decreased slightly in both the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel and Vehicle Gel groups at day 29 
and there seemed to be no worsening of telangiectasias at the follow-up visits. 
A too pronounced pharmacological effect of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel may result in excessive and 
unwanted whitening, which was addressed by the PAW. Higher percentages of subjects in the brimonidine 
tartrate 0.5% Gel groups were bothered by too much whitening compared to the corresponding Vehicle 
Gel groups. However, the number of reports of unwanted over-whitening decreased over the course of 
the studies. No subject discontinued the studies due to over-whitening.  
On  Day  29 the  percentages  of  subjects  with  unwanted  over-whitening  were  rather  similar  in  the 
brimonidine  tartrate  0.5%  and  Vehicle  Gel  groups,  which  may  be  due  to  application  technique  and 
difference  in  contrast  between  treated  and  untreated  areas.  The  treatment  application  technique 
(smooth, even application across all facial surfaces), which generally improves over time in subjects, may 
reduce noticeable contrasts between treated and untreated areas.

Ancillary analyses 
Tachyphylaxis and rebound effects 
Rebound effects can occur after withdrawal of alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist agents in hypertension 
and  for  oxymetazoline  (an  alpha-adrenergic  receptor  antagonist),  both  tachyphylaxis  and  rebound 
increase in nasal airway congestion have been reported (Geyskes 1979; Vaidyanathan 2010). 
The  Applicant  designed  the  Phase  2b  and  the  Phase  3 pivotal  studies  to  investigate  the  potential  of 
brimonidine tartrate Gel to show a reduction in efficacy over time or to cause erythema that was more 
severe following discontinuation of treatment relative to the level of baseline erythema.  
Regarding tachyphylaxis, the Phase 2b and Phase 3 pivotal studies assessed the effects of brimonidine 
tartrate Gel on erythema over a 12-hour observation period on three separate clinic Days; 1, 15, and 29. 
There  was  no  notable  diminishing  in  reduction  in  erythema  within  the  29-day  treatment  period,  as 
assessed  by  the  CEA  and  the  PSA  in  any  of  these  studies.  Thus,  evidence  of  tachyphylaxis  was  not 
observed.  
For  the  assessment  of  potential  for  rebound  erythema,  a  4-week  no  treatment  follow-up  period  was 
included in Studies ROSE-201, 18161, 18140, and 18141, which included assessments of erythema by 
the Investigators and subjects based on the CEA and PSA. 
In the Phase 2b and Phase 3 pivotal studies, the assessment of potential rebound effect was based on 
mean changes in CEA and PSA scores during the post-treatment follow-up period (Weeks 6 and 8 and 
also at Day 30 and Week 5 in Study 18161). In each of the studies, the subjects continued to show some 
reductions in mean CEA and PSA scores relative to Baseline. In Study 18161, the mean reductions in CEA 
scores  ranged  from  0.6 to  0.7 points  and  the  mean  reductions  in  PSA  scores  ranged  from  0.8 to 
0.9 points relative to Day 1/Hour 0 across the 4 follow-up visits.  
For  the  Phase  3 pivotal  studies,  the  mean  changes  in  CEA  scores  at  Week  6 and  Week  8 showed 
reductions  in  the  brimonidine  tartrate  0.5%  Gel  group  of  0.3 points  (SRE.18140)  and  0.5 points 
(SRE.18141)  for  the  CEA  and  0.7 to  0.8 points  (SRE.18140)  and  0.7 points  (SRE.18141)  for  the  PSA 
relative to Day 1/Hour 0 up to 4 weeks following cessation of treatment. In the Phase 3 pivotal studies, 
some subjects showed worsening in CEA and PSA scores relative to Baseline during the follow-up period 
(see table below).

The effect of brimonidine tartrate gel on erythema over a 29-day treatment period, as assessed by the 
CEA and the PSA, did not diminish over time, although the vehicle effect tended to increase somewhat 
over time. Thus, evidence of tachyphylaxis was not observed during a 4-week treatment period.

After cessation of treatment, no aggravation effect (rebound) of subject’s facial erythema, as compared 
to Baseline/Day 1 levels, was observed during the 4-week follow-up period for either treatment group, 
based on mean changes in CEA and PSA scores. Some individuals showed worsening in CEA and PSA 
scores relative to Baseline during the follow-up period.  More subjects in the  brimonidine tartrate gel 
groups compared with the vehicle groups tended to experience worsening during the follow-up period, 
however, the numbers were small (<5% showed 1-grade increases in CEA or PSA). 
No  worsening  of  the  IGA,  increasing  facial  inflammatory  lesion  counts,  or  worsening  of  the  TGA  was 
observed during the 4-week follow-up period in the brimonidine tartrate gel groups.

Efficacy Analysis  
The  primary  analyses  are  to  test  treatment  differences  between  active 
treatment and vehicle treatment on the correlated repeated measurements 
for  Composite  Success  at  Hours  3,  6,  9  and  12  on  Day  29  using  the 
Generalized  Estimating  Equation  (GEE)  methodology  in  the  ITT  population. 
The  logit  link  function  is  used  to  model  the  marginal  expectation.  The 
dependent variables in the model is Composite Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 
12 on Day 29 and the independent variables are treatments, analysis center, 
time  points  (Hours  3,  6,  9,  and  12)  and  treatment*analysis  center.  The 
treatment-by-center  interaction  for  Composite  Success  on  Day  29  was 
assessed at an alpha level of 0.1 by testing treatment-by-center effect in the 
GEE  model.  If  interaction  effect  is  statistically  significant,  the  results  were 
further explored to examine the magnitude, direction, and potential impact of 
the interaction. 
To handle missing data at any time points (i.e. Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12), the 
Multiple  Imputation  (MI)  procedure  was  used  as  the  primary  imputation 
method.  Multiple  imputed  datasets  was  created  by  the  MI  procedure,  GEE 
analysis was performed on each imputed dataset, and the statistical results 
were generated by combining the parameter estimates and covariance matrix 
from each imputed dataset. In additional to the MI procedure, three sensitivity 
analyses were performed by (a) imputing ‘Failure’ in the case of missing data; 
(b) imputing ‘Success’ in the case of missing data; and (c) imputing ‘Success’ 
if at least a 2-grade reduction is observed on CEA and PSA using the average 
score of the repeated measurements at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 12.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were performed in special populations.  
In the Phase 3 pivotal studies, descriptive summaries were prepared for the primary endpoint of 2-grade 
Composite Success by gender, race and age group.  
With respect to gender, more than 20% of the study population was represented by males and the data 
indicate no major gender difference in response for the primary end-point.  
Male representation in studies was low relative to females, consistent with the incidence of rosacea in the 
general population. Noted differences in specific TEAE incidences between the genders are likely due to 
normal variability and not indicative of a gender-specific risk.

With respect to age, a majority of subjects (>90%) were 18 to 64 years old, making it difficult to draw 
conclusions from the subgroup summaries for age groups. In the subgroup of subjects who were 65 years 
of age or older, no more than 3 subjects showed 2-grade Composite Success in either treatment group at 
any time point. There were only 24 subjects in the Mirvaso and vehicle groups, respectively, when both 
studies were pooled. Firm conclusions on efficacy are difficult to make although there is no reason to 
believe that the effect of Mirvaso would differ to a large extent in this age group.   
Available data do not indicate that subjects ≥65 years of age have an increased risk of adverse events 
when compared to subjects 18 to 64 years of age. However, the number of subjects ≥65 years of age was 
relatively small and the age distribution was not presented. The data presented by the applicant raise no 
concerns although the number of subjects above 65 years is very limited.  
With respect to race, the vast majority of subjects were Caucasians (>98%) and only few non-Caucasians 
were represented (in total 4 subjects in each study). In Study 18140, none of the 2 non-Caucasians who 
received active treatment reached 2-grade Composite Success at any time point and in Study 18141, 1 
out of 3 non-Caucasians reached 2-grade Composite Success on active treatment on Day 29. Section 5.1 
of the SmPC includes information that the majority of the subjects studied were Caucasian. 
In a subgroup analysis made with respect to baseline severity of erythema, the active treatment showed 
statistically significant separation from vehicle at each time point in 2-grade Composite Success on Days 
1, 15, and 29 in subjects with baseline PSA or CEA severity of 4 (e.g., severe). Across Studies 18140 and 
18141, 2-grade Composite Success in subjects with severe erythema at baseline ranged from 8.9% to 
26.6% in the active group vs. 0.0% to 11.1% in the vehicle group. 
Supportive study 
Study RD.06.SRE.18142  
A multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of CD07805/47 Gel 0.5% 
applied  topically  once  daily  for  up  to  52 weeks  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  facial  erythema 
associated with rosacea 
Methods 
This was a long-term, open-label, uncontrolled study in subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema 
of rosacea. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% 
Gel applied for up to 52 weeks (no less than 365 days). The study was initiated on 10 March 2011 and 
completed on 13 June 2012. 
•  Study participants  
The subjects included were male or female, of any race, 18 years of age or older, with screening and 
Baseline visit Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scale scores 
of ≥3. There were two differences in eligibility criteria compared to the Phase 3 pivotal studies regarding 
inflammatory lesions and concomitant rosacea treatments. Subjects with 3 or more inflammatory lesions 
were  eligible  to  participate  in  this  study.  Additionally,  concomitant  standard  of  care  treatments 
(doxycycline, metronidazole, etc.) for subjects with inflammatory lesions of rosacea were allowed in all 
phases of the study. Subjects on active treatments for lesions at the time of enrolment were permitted to 
continue their current regimen for the duration of the study and if necessary, the regimen could have 
been modified by the Investigator during the course of the study. For subjects who required new therapy 
for  the  presence  of  inflammatory  lesions  at  the  time  of  enrolment  or  during  the  course  of  the  study, 
Investigators were permitted to prescribe the standard of care treatment at the Investigator’s discretion.

In contrast to the controlled studies, inclusion of patients with 3 or more inflammatory lesions and with 
concomitant standard of care treatments (doxycycline, metronidazole, etc.) for inflammatory lesions of 
rosacea  was  allowed,  which  results  in  a  study  population  probably  more  reflecting  the  true  rosacea 
population. 
•  Treatments 
CD07805/47 gel 0.5% was applied once daily to the entire face. Qualified, screened subjects were treated 
for up to 12 months (no less than 365 days) and were to return to the investigational site for evaluations 
at Baseline, Week 1, and at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12/Early Termination (ET). Laboratory samples were 
to  be  obtained  at  Screening,  Month  3,  Month  6,  and  Month  12/ET.  Intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  was 
measured at Baseline, Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12/ET. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and document the long-term safety of CD07805/47 
gel  0.5%  applied  once  daily  and  long-term  efficacy  was  evaluated  as  a  secondary  objective.  Efficacy 
end-points were PSA and CEA,  assessed at Hour 0 and Hour 3 at each visit, change in PSA/CEA from 
Baseline PSA (Hour 0 at Baseline visit) at each post-baseline visit, and change in PSA/CEA between Hour 
0 and Hour 3 at each visit. Other end-points were PAA, OTE, IGA, TGA, PAW, inflammatory lesion counts 
and Productivity and Social Life Questionnaires. 
•  Sample size 
The sample size of 450 was chosen based on the ICH E1A Guideline: Extent of Population Exposure to 
Assess Clinical Safety. It was estimated with 450 subjects enrolled and receiving study drug, at least 300 
subjects would be exposed for 6 months and at least 100 subjects would be exposed for 12 months. 
•  Statistical methods 
Summary  statistics  and  frequency  distributions  for  the  PSA,  CEA,  PAA  and  other  assessments  were 
presented for the Baseline visit and all post-Baseline visits (Week 1, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, 
Month 12, and End of Treatment). Results from Hour 0 and Hour 3 time points and changes between time 
points were presented. The PSA, CEA, and PAA assessments were also summarized within the subgroups 
gender,  age  group  (18  to  64  years  versus  65  years  and  above)  and  race  (Caucasian  versus 
non-Caucasian).No particular statistical method was described. 
•  Results 
Of  586  subjects  screened,  137  subjects  were  screen  failures,  mainly  due  to  not  meeting  the 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. A total of 449 subjects were enrolled and all subjects were included in the 
Safety  Population.  Two  hundred  seventy-nine  (279)  subjects  (62.1%)  completed  the  study  and 
335 subjects (74.6%) completed at least 6 months of treatment. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics in this study were similar to those in the pivotal 
phase  3  studies.  Almost  30%  of  the  subjects  took  concomitant  therapies  for  inflammatory  lesions 
associated with their rosacea, with Metronidazole being most common (15.6%). 
In this study, the open-label study design and subject attrition over time hampers the interpretation of 
efficacy results. Furthermore, other rosacea treatments were allowed. The PSA and CEA results, however, 
indicated that the study drug had an effect after the first application and that no obvious tachyphylaxis of 
the treatment effect occurred over time with chronic use. The results for mean changes in PSA and CEA

at the Month 1 visit were rather similar to the results observed in Phase 2b and Phase 3 controlled clinical 
studies.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of Mirvaso gel 0.5% is supported by six clinical studies; three phase 2 studies, two pivotal 
phase 3 studies and one open-label, long-term phase 3 study. Both the phase 2 and the pivotal phase 3 
studies were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group and vehicle-controlled. The treatment period was 
29 days in all studies except one phase 2a study that was a single dose study. The studies enrolled male 
and female patients 18 years of age or above, with moderate to severe facial erythema associated with 
rosacea,  with  less  than  3  inflammatory  lesions.  Other  rosacea  treatments  were  not  allowed  in  the 
controlled studies. 
Mirvaso is a product targeting a single symptom of  rosacea, i.e. facial erythema, while other rosacea 
products  mainly  affect  other  symptoms  of  the  condition,  e.g.  by  reducing  inflammatory  papules  and 
pustules. There is no European guideline available for products indicated for treatment of rosacea and 
efficacy end-points to be used are not clearly established. The applicant developed the CEA (Clinician 
Erythema Assessment) scale and the PSA (Patient Self-Assessment) scales that were used as co-primary 
end-points in the pivotal phase 3 studies as well as phase 2 studies. The development and validation of 
the CEA and PSA scales have been described in the dossier and specific studies have been performed to 
address their relevance, e.g. by assessment of inter- and intra-rater agreement and content validity. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 76/107 
 
  
  
scales  are  deemed  to  be  sufficiently  described  and  validated  for  their  intended  purpose.  It  should  be 
acknowledged that both the PSA and the CEA are scales that are based on subjective judgements and not 
objective  measures.  However,  considering  the  type  of  condition  and  the  intended  use  of  the  product 
(symptomatic reduction of erythema rather than curative treatment), assessments made by the patient 
are of relevance.  
In  addition,  other  patient  rated  scales  were  used,  such  as  Patient  Assessment  of  Appearance  (PAA), 
Overall Treatment Effect (OTE) and Patient Assessment of Whitening (PAW). Furthermore, assessments 
of inflammatory lesion counts, telangiectasia and quality of life were made by the use of different scales.  
In the pivotal phase 3 studies, subjects were randomized to receive study drug for a period of 4 weeks and 
returned to the investigational centres on Weeks 6 and 8 for follow-up evaluations. . The inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria  are  overall  acceptable.  Subject  assessments  were  performed  at  the  investigational 
center during a 12-hour post-dose evaluation period on Days 1, 15, and 29. On non-clinic days (Days 
2-14 and 16-28) subjects were to apply study drug as directed and to complete daily self-assessments 
(PSA, PAA and PAW). The Overall Treatment Effect (OTE) was assessed by the patient on Day 29. Quality 
of Life assessed by the SF-12v2™ Acute Health Survey and a Productivity and Social Life Questionnaire 
were also completed at specified visits. The applicant discussed that the results observed and noted they 
could have been due to several factors, including small number of subjects, recall bias, and suboptimal 
timing  of  the  assessment.  Nonetheless,  the  overall  results  from  the  OTE  favour  brimonidine,  with 
significantly  more  subjects  on  Mirvaso  in  each  study  (p<0.001)  reporting  improvement  in  the 
management of their facial erythema as assessed by the OTE compared to vehicle subjects. It seems 
plausible that in an overall assessment, some subjects experienced the wearing off of the effect at the end 
of  the  day  as  a  worsening  and  that  this  is  more  pronounced  in  the  active  than  the  vehicle  group.  All 
subjects will not respond to Mirvaso in a satisfactory manner, however, the overall OTE results show that 
the majority of patients experienced an improvement with Mirvaso; this was agreed by the CHMP. 
The  investigator/evaluator  (a  board-certified  dermatologist)  completed  the  CEA  at  each  clinic  visit. 
Telangiectasias assessed by TGA and inflammatory lesions assessed by IGA and lesion counts were also 
performed. Whenever possible, the same investigator/evaluator was to perform the assessments for each 
individual subject for the entire duration of the study. On Days 1, 15 and 29, CEA and PSA were assessed 
at the time points 30 minutes and 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after T0. 
The primary efficacy end-point was 2-grade Composite Success at Hours 3, 6, 9, 12 on Day 29, then on 
Day 15 and lastly on Day 1, with 2-grade Composite Success defined as a 2-grade improvement on both 
CEA and PSA at each time point. The secondary efficacy end-point was early, 30-minute effect, defined as 
1-grade  Composite  Success  (1-grade  improvement  on  both  CEA  and  PSA)  at  30 minutes  on  Day  1. 
Several tertiary and other end-points were also evaluated. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Different concentrations of brimonidine tartrate gel were used in the phase 2 studies and based on results 
of the studies, the 0.5% concentration of brimonidine tartrate Gel administered once daily was selected 
for the Phase 3 studies. Concentrations higher than 0.5% or BID application of the 0.5% gel have not 
been studied. The decision to go for the 0.5% QD posology was also based on pharmacokinetic results, 
since  a  higher  gel  concentration  or  BID  application  may  result  in  too  high  systemic  exposure  to 
brimonidine. The rationale for not selecting a higher concentration or a BID dose regimen was to maintain 
an  optimized  benefit/risk  ratio  for  the  product  and  to  avoid  excessive,  unwanted  pharmacodynamic 
effects  (such  as  “over-whitening”).  The  applicant  has  adequately  outlined  their  reasoning  behind  the 
choice of the 0.5% concentration and the administration frequency of the product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 77/107 
 
  
  
In the pivotal phase 3 studies, the majority of included subjects were females (>70%) with a mean age 
of 45-50 years. Almost only Caucasian or white subjects were included. Most subjects had a Fitzpatrick 
skin phototype of II or III. The population included reflects the population most commonly affected by 
rosacea, i.e. mainly females, aged 30-50 years and with fair skin. The subjects included had moderate to 
severe  facial  erythema  (PSA  and  CEA  scores  of  3  or  4)  with  the  majority  (generally  >80%)  having 
moderate  erythema.  There  were  no  major  differences  between  the  active  treatment  and  the  vehicle 
groups  in  baseline  characteristics  in  the  two  pivotal  studies.  The  number  of  subjects  completing  the 
studies was high (>96%) in both studies.  
In both pivotal studies, brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel was significantly superior (p<0.001) compared to 
Vehicle Gel for the primary endpoint (2-grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 
12  on  Day  29).  Statistical  superiority  of  brimonidine  tartrate  0.5%  Gel  versus  Vehicle  Gel  was  also 
demonstrated on Days 1 and 15 (p<0.001). The results were confirmed in the ITT Population using the 
LOCF method, in the MITT population (in Study 18141) and the PP Population, and in sensitivity analyses. 
There was a tendency to an increased response across days 1, 15 and 29 both in the active and vehicle gel 
treated groups. On Day 29, the vehicle response was approximately 10% and for Brimonidine Tartrate 
0.5%  Gel,  the  response  at  different  time  points  ranged  between  17.6%  and  31.5%.  This  fact  also 
observed at 2 additional centres in study 18141 and also in 3 centres in study 18140. Although this could 
be due to normal variation, it could also indicate problems related to blinding. The applicant was asked to 
discuss this finding and analyse the efficacy data from both studies without these centres.  
The  requested  analyses  were  provided  with  exclusion  of  sites  for  which  none  of  the  vehicle  subjects 
achieved 2-grade Composite Success on Day 29. This concerned a fairly large number of sites (a total of 
12 out of 30). Still, statistical significance vs. vehicle was maintained for all comparisons, except for the 
Day 29 results in study 18141. It is agreed that with an anticipated 10% incidence of 2-grade Composite 
Success  in  the  vehicle  group  it  is  not  unlikely  that  there  would  be  several  sites  without  any  vehicle 
subjects achieving 2-grade Composite Success.  
The highest response was observed at the 3 and 6 hour time points and the effect tended to wear off at 
the later time points. 
For the secondary endpoint (30-Minute effect), brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel produced a statistically 
significant (p<0.001) earlier effect compared to the Vehicle Gel groups in both pivotal studies based on 
the definition used. Approximately 28% of subjects in the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel group showed 
1-grade improvement on both the CEA and PSA at 30 minutes post-dosing on Day 1, compared to 5-7% 
of Vehicle Gel subjects. 
Tertiary efficacy end-points also supported the superiority of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel over vehicle 
gel. However, the patient self-assessments PAA and OTE also showed that quite substantial numbers of 
patients were not satisfied with their appearance or experienced worsening of the condition at the end of 
treatment.  For  the  OTE,  twice  as  many  subjects  in  the  active  treatment  group  vs.  the  vehicle  group 
considered that their condition had worsened as a result of the treatment; but overall, more subjects 
considered that their condition had improved in the Mirvaso vs. the vehicle group. No effect on Quality of 
life assessments could be shown.  
The studies were performed under rather standardised, experimental conditions, i.e. the patients arrived 
at the investigational center 1 hour prior to study drug application to allow acclimation to the environment 
and were required to rest comfortably for 15 minutes before assessments  were completed. Thus, the 
conditions may not reflect “real-life” conditions, e.g. situations that may cause the erythema of rosacea 
to flare up, e.g. sun, cold or wind, exercise and stress. The applicant adequately justified that the effect 
seen  in  the  pivotal  studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  normal,  “real-life”  conditions.  During  the  12-hour 
post-dosing  period  on  clinic  days,  subjects  were  permitted  to  leave  the  investigative  sites  between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 78/107 
 
  
  
assessments and were not confined to the site for the entire 12 hours, and activities/behaviours/food 
intake were not monitored or restricted between the assessment time points. Subjects were educated on 
typical  factors  that  may  exacerbate  rosacea  and  were  encouraged  to  maintain  a  consistent  lifestyle 
regarding these factors but were not required to agree to abstain from consumption of alcohol or spicy 
food or from exercise during the study in order to be eligible. The non-clinic days are also representative 
of real-life conditions since the subject applied the study drug themselves at home and participated in 
typical daily activities and made self-assessments of the treatment effect by PSA. It is concluded that the 
conditions  in  the  pivotal  studies  are  sufficiently  representative  of  real-life  conditions.  Study  18142, 
although  open-label  also provides  support  for  use  of  Mirvaso  during  real-life  conditions,  including  the 
possibility to use together Mirvaso with other rosacea medications. 
The efficacy and safety of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel in patients treated with other topical products for 
the treatment of rosacea, e.g. metronidazole or azelaic acid gel, has not been systematically investigated. 
In clinical practice, a combination of Mirvaso and metronidazole gel is likely, since a rapid onset of effect 
on  erythema  may  be  desirable  or  if  metronidazole  does  not  sufficiently  reduce  erythema.  In  the 
open-label long-term study, other rosacea treatments were allowed and a fairly large percentage of the 
subjects (almost 30%) used other topical rosacea products although the number of subjects (n=131) 
does not constitute a large database. Of these, metronidazole use was most common (70 subjects, 15.6 
%) and azelaic acid less common (27 subjects, 6.0%). Efficacy results show roughly similar results for 
2-grade  composite  success  for  subjects  with  or  without  concomitant  rosacea  medication.  Also  from  a 
safety perspective, concomitant use of Mirvaso with other topical rosacea products did not seem to result 
in safety problems, e.g. related to local tolerability.  
In section 4.2 of the SmPC, it is stated that other cutaneous products for the treatment of inflammatory 
lesions of rosacea may be used and should be applied after the applied Mirvaso has dried. Information is 
also  included  in  section  5.1  and  it  is  stated  that  the  use  of  Mirvaso  with  other  medications  for  the 
treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea has not been systematically investigated. 
Long-term  efficacy  data  is  limited  to  the  open-label  safety  study  18142,  with  efficacy  assessed  as 
secondary  endpoint  and  only  up  to  three  hours  after  application.  Aspects  related  to  the  risk  of 
tachyphylaxis  have  been  adequately  addressed.  A  comparison  of  efficacy  results  at  3  hours  among 
studies 18140, 18141 and 18142 has shown a similar level of activity after 28 days and after 1 year of 
use. These results support the notion that efficacy, once the peak is reached, is maintained over time. 
PK data show no accumulation of the drug in the plasma, in line with the known half-life of brimonidine. 
The decrease of activity over time registered during the single day of application is presumably linked to 
the half-life of the active  substance more than to a significant down regulation of receptors. Also,  an 
assessment of the correlation between the amount of drug used and PSA scores has shown no deliberate 
over-usage (which would have indicated a potential decrease in efficacy) after several days of use.  
All studies have been performed in the US or Canada, while no data in the EU is available. For this type of 
condition,  a  difference  between  populations  and  the  disease  is  not  expected  and  it  is  considered 
acceptable to extrapolate the data from the US/Canadian population to the EU population.  
No study including an active comparator has been performed. Currently, there are no approved medicinal 
products in the EU that directly target the persistent facial erythema of rosacea and available products 
primarily  target  the  papulopustular  rosacea  subtype  of  the  disease,  reducing  rosacea  inflammatory 
lesions through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Comparisons with topical metronidazole or azelaic acid 
gel may therefore not be relevant, although since at least topical metronidazole is claiming some effect 
towards  reducing  the  erythema  component  of  rosacea,  a  comparison  would  have  added  further 
information. However, as brimonidine tartrate gel and these other products have different time courses 
for effect, with brimonidine tartrate gel showing a rapid effect on facial erythema while metronidazole or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 79/107 
 
  
  
azelaic acid have slower onset of effect, a comparison would likely have been difficult. Thus, it is agreed 
that active comparator studies are not necessary. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A  significantly  superior  effect  for  brimonidine  tartrate  0.5%  Gel  compared  to  Vehicle  Gel  was 
demonstrated for the primary endpoint on Days 29 (2-grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA at Hours 
3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29) and then on Day 15 and lastly on Day 1, with 2-grade Composite Success 
defined as a 2-grade improvement on both CEA and PSA at each time point. For the Overall Treatment 
Effect  (OTE),  twice  as  many  subjects  in  the  active  treatment  group  compared  with  the  vehicle  group 
considered that their condition had worsened as a result of treatment, though. This could have been due 
to  several  factors,  including  small  number  of  subjects,  recall  bias,  and  suboptimal  timing  of  the 
administration  of  the  assessment.  It  seems  plausible  that  in  an  overall  assessment,  some  subjects 
experienced the  wearing  off  of  the  effect  at  the  end  of  the  day  as  a  worsening  and  that  this  is  more 
pronounced in the active than the vehicle group. The overall OTE results showed that the majority of 
patients experienced an improvement with Mirvaso.  
For the TGA, chronic long-term use of the study drug did not seem to exacerbate telangiectasia severity. 
For the PAW, the proportions of subjects who reported too much whitening and being bothered by too 
much whitening were rather high initially but tended to decrease throughout the course of the study. No 
subjects discontinued the study due to too much whitening or blanching of the skin.  
A positive psychosocial impact on rosacea patients’ lives upon long-term use of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% 
Gel, based on results from the social life questions in the Productivity and Social Life Questionnaire, is 
claimed by the applicant. However, these results are interpreted very cautiously by the CHMP considering 
the open-label study design. 
There is no data available to assess efficacy of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel in patients treated with 
other  topical  products  for  the  treatment  of  rosacea,  e.g.  metronidazole  or  azelaic  acid  gel.  In  clinical 
practice,  a  combination  of  Mirvaso  and  metronidazole  gel  is  likely,  since  a  rapid  onset  of  effect  on 
erythema may be desirable or if metronidazole does not sufficiently reduce erythema.  In the open-label 
long-term study, other rosacea treatments were allowed and a fairly large percentage of the subjects 
(131, almost 30%) used other topical rosacea products. Efficacy results show roughly similar results for 
2-grade composite success for subjects with or without concomitant rosacea medication. In conclusion, 
the applicant has adequately outlined their reasoning behind the choice of the 0.5% concentration and 
the administration frequency of the product. 
Overall, Brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% has demonstrated a positive symptomatic effect on the erythema 
of facial rosacea, which is deemed clinically relevant.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety monitoring of brimonidine tartrate gel for each study was performed adequately by collecting 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and routine laboratory data, physical examination, and vital 
signs and, in some studies, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Because ophthalmic brimonidine 
tartrate is approved for treating high IOP when applied as an aqueous solution, the Applicant evaluated 
any potential of topical brimonidine tartrate gel to reduce IOP systemically or after unintended contact 
with the eye. 
The submission consists of 18 studies supporting safety and efficacy of brimonidine tartrate in cutaneous 
treatment of facial erythema of rosacea in adult patients. Ten (10) of the 18 studies were conducted in 
subjects with rosacea and 8 studies were conducted in healthy subjects.

Patient exposure 
In total, 1619 subjects were exposed to brimonidine tartrate gels out of 2174 participants in the 18 
studies in the clinical development program. Of the 1619 subjects, 1210 subjects were exposed to 
brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel QD. 
Eight studies of the gel formulation were conducted in healthy subjects; 423 healthy subjects were 
exposed to active gel formulations (0.07% gel, 0.18% gel, 0.20% gel or 0.50% gel) and 432 subjects 
received vehicle gel applications.  
Nine clinical studies, excluding the LTS study, were conducted in subjects with rosacea; 747 rosacea 
subjects were exposed to active gel formulations (0.02% gel, 0.07% gel, 0.1% gel, 0.18% gel, 0.20% 
gel, and 0.50% gel) and 462 rosacea subjects received vehicle gel applications. In addition, 120 subjects 
in Studies RD.06.SRE.18126 and RD.06.SRE.18143 were treated with the 0.2% ophthalmic solution.  
A total of 1210 subjects have been exposed to brimonidine tartrate 0.5% QD, of which 330 rosacea 
subjects were included in the pivotal phase 3 studies (RD.06.SRE.18140 and RD.06.SRE.18141) and the 
phase 2b study (18161). In the long term safety study, 276 patients were exposed for more than 1 year. 
Thus, the number of patients exposed to brimonidine tartrate at the recommended dosage is considered 
sufficient. 
In the long-term study  RD.06.SRE.18142, a total of 449 subjects were to be exposed to 0.50% gel QD up 
to 365 days; 276 of these subjects were exposed for ≥365 days in this study. 
The mean age of subjects is approximately 50 years. No subjects below the age of 18 were exposed to the 
study drug which is as anticipated since rosacea is a very rare disease in children/adolescents. 25 patients 
above 65 years of age were exposed to brimonidine gel in the core studies and 54 were exposed in the LTS 
study. Women are more common than men (approximately 75%) among study subjects, which reflect

the gender distribution of the disease. Further, subjects with fair skin (photo skin type II and III) are more 
frequently affected than those with darker skin types, also reflected in the demographics of rosacea 
subjects.

first month of the LTS Study RD.06.SRE.18142, the four most frequently reported TEAEs were, in order of 
decreasing frequency, flushing (5.8%), erythema (4.5%), headache (3.3%) and rosacea (2.2%). The

incidences of erythema and headache occurring with 0.50% gel treatment in the Controlled Core Studies 
are similar with that in the LTS study. Flushing, however, occurred more frequently in the first month of 
the LTS study than in the controlled active group or the vehicle group.

Systemic TEAEs related to study drug 
No  related  TEAEs  were  observed  regarding  Respiratory,  Infections/Infestations,  Cardiac,  or  Metabolic 
Disorders. Alcohol intolerance reported for 3 subjects in RD.06.SRE.18140 should have been coded to PT 
Flushing  in  Vascular  Disorders,  given  that  the  transient  episodes  of  facial  flushing  were  triggered  by 
alcohol ingestion. The incidences of Nervous System Disorders related to the study drug were similar in

the controlled active and vehicle populations and were slightly higher for headache in the LTS group. 
Systemic adverse events do not seem to be a problem. 
Local tolerance 
A  dermal  tolerance  program  has  been  conducted,  which  included  sensitization,  cumulative  irritation, 
photosensitization, and phototoxicity in healthy subjects. Local tolerability effects (as observed in the 
5 dermal safety studies) were assessed with respect to the application site in accordance with accepted 
standards for dermatology studies. In addition to the dermal tolerance studies, the Applicant monitored 
subjects closely for suspected local skin reactions.  
Local tolerability studies 
The  Applicant  conducted  six  dermal  safety  studies  in  healthy  subjects:  2  phototoxicity  studies 
(COL-118-Phototoxicity-104  and  RD.06.SRE.18189),  2  sensitization  studies  (RD.06.SRE.18123  and 
RD.06.SRE.18124), 1 cumulative irritation study (RD.06.SRE.18125), and 1 SPF study of the Vehicle Gel 
(RD.06.SRE.18137). In this group of studies, the study drugs were not applied to the face but to a small 
area on the back.  
All  applications  were  performed  under  patch  occlusion  except  for  those  applications  in  the  SPF  study 
RD.06.SRE.18137. In RD.06.SRE.18137, the Vehicle Gel was compared to an active control, homosalate 
8% lotion. 
In the Brimonidine Tartrate gel formulation, titanium dioxide (TiO2) accounts for only 0.625% of the total 
composition. Titanium dioxide is a compound known to have a high refractive index and strong ultraviolet 
(UV) light absorbing capacity. The SPF of the vehicle was measured to support the contention that TiO2 
serves only a structural function, and does not convey significant UV blocking/absorbing capacity to the 
product.  
In all studies, safety was  followed by collecting AEs, local tolerability measurements and concomitant 
medications;  no  laboratory  measurements,  vital  sign  determinations,  or  physical  examinations  were 
performed. 
Phototoxicity studies COL-118-Phototoxicity-104 and RD.06.SRE.18189 
Two phototoxicity studies were conducted in healthy subjects to determine the effect of exposure to UV 
light  on  skin  pre-treated  with  duplicate  single  applications  of  Brimonidine  Tartrate  Gel  0.20% 
(COL-118-Phototoxicity-104,  30  subjects)  or  Brimonidine  Tartrate  Gel  0.07%,  0.18%,  and  0.50% 
(RD.06.SRE.18189, 35 subjects) to opposite sides of the back. In both studies, the Vehicle Gel was also 
tested. In COL-118-Phototoxicity-104, an unirradiated set of treated areas served as controls.  
No phototoxic effects were reported in either study. 
Photosensitization potential of Brimonidine Tartrate Gel (RD.06.SRE.18124) 
In Study SRE.18124, the photosensitization potential of Brimonidine Tartrate Gel was investigated after 
repeated  applications  followed  by  ultraviolet  (UV)  exposure  in  57 healthy  subjects.  The  study  drugs 
included Gel Vehicle, white petrolatum (negative control), and Brimonidine Tartrate Gel (0.07%, 0.18%, 
and 0.50%).  
The study consisted of the following phases: a 3-week induction phase during which the study drugs were 
applied under occlusion 3 times a week for 3 weeks, a 2-week rest period, a challenge phase lasting up to 
1 week, and a re-challenge phase if applicable. The individual minimum erythemal dose (MED) for each 
subject was determined prior to initial study drug application and the skin was irradiated at pre-specified 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 85/107 
 
  
  
 
times during the induction and challenge phases. In this study, 1 site was left untreated and irradiated as 
a control for radiation sensitivity.  
No skin reaction worse than mild erythema occurred at any test site. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014

Cumulative irritation study RD.06.SRE.18125 
The cumulative irritancy of increasing concentrations of active gel (0.0%, 0.07%, 0.18%, and 0.50%) 
was assessed versus white petrolatum (negative control) and 0.25% SLS (positive control) applied to the 
upper backs of 38 healthy subjects exposed for up to 22 days to the test treatments.  
Overall, 7 out of 38 subjects reported TEAEs during this study. These included 1 serious (and severe) 
TEAE,  gastroenteritis,  which  resulted  in  study  discontinuation.  The  SAE  plus  all  of  the  other  6 TEAEs 
(gastroenteritis 
(2  subjects),  nasopharyngitis,  venomous  bite,  arthralgia,  headache,  and 
dysmenorrhoea) were not considered to be related to the study treatment.  
SPF Study of the Vehicle Gel RD.06.SRE.18137 
Following a 30-minute application of the test formulation in 25 subjects, the static SPF value of the Gel 
Vehicle was measured and compared to that of active control, homosalate 8% lotion (sunscreen) and an 
untreated site in an intra-individual comparison in 25 healthy subjects.  
No adverse events were reported in this study. 
Sensitization potential of Brimonidine Tartrate Gel (RD.06.SRE.18123) 
In Study RD.06.SRE.18123, the sensitization potential of Brimonidine Tartrate Gel was investigated in 
247 healthy subjects after repeated applications. The study drugs included Gel Vehicle, white petrolatum 
(negative control), and Brimonidine Tartrate Gel (0.07%, 0.18%, and 0.50%). The gel formulation used 
in  Study  RD.06.SRE.18123 contained  0.3%  methylparaben  while 
that  used 
in  Study 
RD.06.SRE.18124 contained 0.1% methylparaben. The reduction of the quantity of methylparaben did 
not reduce preservative efficacy nor impact the validity of the study results. 
The study consisted of the following phases: a 3-week induction phase during which the study drugs were 
applied under occlusion 3 times a week for 3 weeks, a 2-week rest period, a challenge phase lasting up to 
1 week, and a re-challenge phase if applicable. 
There were few observations of mild erythema and a few cases of moderate erythema. 
Conclusions on dermal tolerance studies  
The  dermal  tolerance  studies  showed  no  detectable  phototoxicity  or  photosensitization  potential,  low 
contact sensitization potential, and low cumulative irritancy potential for the active formulations and for 
the vehicle, which was consistent with non-clinical local tolerance studies.  
Sensitization reactions observed in clinical trials 
Possible sensitization reactions were reported in 2 out of the 18 clinical trials conducted for Brimonidine 
Tartrate Gel: Studies 18123 and 18142. 
In Study 18123, the evaluation of the sensitization potential of various concentrations of the study drug 
and vehicle showed no evidence of sensitization except in 1 subject who exhibited positive sensitization 
results at Challenge with  Brimonidine Tartrate 0.07% Gel and Vehicle and exhibited equivocal results 
during  a  re-challenge  with  the  original  test  products.  This  subject  was  unavailable  for  a  second 
confirmatory re-challenge. Given that the subject showed reactions at both challenge and rechallenge to 
sites  patched  with  active and  vehicle,  this  suggests  that  the  skin  reaction  was  likely  due  to  a  vehicle 
excipient rather than the active drug substance. 
In  Study  18142,  24 of  the  449 enrolled  subjects  (5.3%)  developed  adverse  reactions  for  which  the 
Investigators requested patch testing in order to rule out an allergic sensitization to the study product 
(contact dermatitis). Of these 24 subjects, 17 agreed to undergo diagnostic patch testing. Fourteen (14) 
subjects had a negative patch test result, suggesting no allergy to the study drug and 3 subjects had a 
positive patch test result. Of the 3 positive cases, 2 agreed to further testing with individual study product

Page 87/107 
 
  
  
ingredients. One of the 2 subjects was found to be allergic to brimonidine tartrate and the other subject 
was found to be allergic to phenoxyethanol, a preservative excipient.  
Based on the incidences of AEs from the 7 subjects who refused rechallenge/patch testing (1.6%) and the 
3 subjects  who  had  a  positive  patch  test  (0.7%),  it  could  be  conservatively  estimated  that  the 
sensitization rate for this study was approximately 2.2%. Of the 17 subjects who had a rechallenge/patch 
test,  3  had  a  positive  result  (17.6%),  and  it  is  likely  that  not  all  of  the  7 subjects  who  refused  the 
rechallenge/patch test would be allergic to the study drug. If a similar incidence (17.6%) is applied, it is 
likely that 1 or 2 subjects who refused rechallenge/patch testing may have had a positive result, which 
would lead to an overall sensitization rate of approximately 1% for this study. For these 10 subjects, all 
of the suspected allergic reactions occurred after 4 weeks of exposure, with the onset between 3 and 
6 months in the majority of these subjects. 
The rate of sensitization for the 1619 subjects exposed to Brimonidine Tartrate Gel was estimated at <1% 
across the entire clinical development program. This estimate was based on a conservative calculation 
including the 3 subjects with initially positive patch tests in Study 18142, the 7 subjects  who refused 
rechallenge/patch  testing  in  Study  18142,  and  the  1 subject  with  suspected  (but  unconfirmed) 
sensitization in Study 18123.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
There was one death reported in one of the 18 clinical studies performed. In the long term safety study, 
RD.06.SRE.18142, one subject had an SAE of lung cancer that led to death. The SAE was considered by 
the Investigator to be unrelated to brimonidine tartrate treatment, and this is agreed. 
Serious adverse events 
Of the 18 studies in the brimonidine tartrate gel development program, seven studies reported one or 
more  SAEs.  Serious  adverse  events  were  pooled  for  the  controlled  pivotal  studies  RD.06.SRE.18140, 
RD.06.SRE.18141, and RD.06.SRE.18161 (0.50% gel treatment group). None of the SAEs was attributed 
to study treatment. 
Accidental drug intake by children 
Two children of a subject assigned to 0.50% gel in Study RD.06.SRE.18140 mistook the study drug for 
toothpaste  and  hence  ingested  the  study  product.  They  experienced  the  following  TEAEs;  lethargy, 
respiratory  distress,  irregular  heart  rate,  and  psychomotor  hyperactivity.  It  is  agreed  that  the  TEAEs 
resulting from accidental ingestion by young children do not affect the overall safety profile in the target 
population, as this TEAE is not observed after normal usage in a study subject. 
Laboratory findings 
Brimonidine  tartrate  gel  did  not  induce  any  laboratory  findings  as  could  be  expected  considering  the 
relatively low systemic uptake of the active compound. The decrease in white blood cell count in one 
subject does not raise cause for concern. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  the  potential  differences  of  common  TEAEs  within  a 
subgroup compared with the entire population. The incidence rates for common TEAEs were summarized 
by main intrinsic factors (gender, age, race, ethnicity).

a Subject 18140-8076-028 was assigned to the 0.50% gel group; her 2 children accidentally ingested the 
study drug and their mother is counted here. 
The incidence of TEAEs overall for adult subjects on active therapy was slightly higher than that for 
geriatric subjects on active therapy across the pivotal studies. Similarly, the incidences for related TEAEs 
in the adult subjects were either the same (17%, LTS group) or higher (13%, active controlled group) 
than incidences for related TEAEs in the geriatric group (17%, LTS group; 0%, active controlled group).  
These findings indicate that subjects 65 years of age and older are not at increased risk of TEAEs with use 
of the study product compared to younger subjects. 
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders was the predominant SOC and more adult subjects reported 
these TEAEs (13-14%) when compared to their older counterparts (7-8%). No treatment-related TEAEs 
were seen in any geriatric subject treated with 0.50% gel in the Controlled Core Studies. Nine (9) geriatric

subjects  (16.7%)  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs  in  the  first  29  days  of  the  LTS  study,  the  most 
frequently being flushing (4 subjects, 7.4%) and erythema (2 subjects, 3.7%). 
Race 
There were a very small number of Non-Caucasian participants (in total 12 subjects in the Controlled Core 
Studies and 11 subjects in the LTS study); hence, analyses of TEAEs by race are difficult. 
There  were  similar  proportions  of  Caucasian  (33.1%  active  gel,  27.6%  vehicle)  and  Non-Caucasian 
(28.6% active gel, 20% vehicle) subjects reporting TEAEs overall in the Controlled Core Studies. There 
were 2 Non-Caucasian subjects in the 0.50% group and 1 Non-Caucasian subject in the vehicle group in 
the  Controlled  Core  Studies  who  reported  TEAEs  overall,  and  of  these  subjects,  only  1 subject  in  the 
vehicle group had a related TEAE (skin tightness). No Non-Caucasian subjects reported any SAEs, TEAEs 
resulting in discontinuation, or severe TEAEs in any Core study. 
Pregnant women 
Pregnant or lactating women with erythema of rosacea were excluded from participation in studies with 
Brimonidine Tartrate Gel. Subjects who became pregnant during the studies were required to withdraw 
immediately and the pregnancy was to be followed up to the final outcome. 
There  were  4  pregnancies  reported  during  the  clinical  development  program,  1  in  Study 
RD.06.SRE.18123,  1  in  Study  COL-118-ROSE-201,  and  2  in  Study  RD.06.SRE.18142.  No  reports  of 
hospitalization during pregnancy, foetal distress, miscarriage, or birth defects were received. 
Immunological events 
The observed rate of sensitization in the clinical studies does not seem to be cause for concern and seems 
to be in a range observed for currently approved topical products. No concerns are raised. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with other topical or systemic products for 
the treatment of rosacea or with cosmetics. In the pivotal, controlled phase 3 studies, use of other topical 
or  systemic  products  for  the  treatment  of  rosacea  was  not  permitted,  whereas  in  the  open-label, 
long-term phase 3 study, other rosacea treatments were allowed. 
Of  the  subjects  randomized  to  0.50%  gel  in  the  Controlled  Core  Studies,  77%  received  1  or  more 
concomitant medications and 71% of subjects treated with vehicle received concomitant medications. At 
least 10% of subjects in the Controlled Core Studies were concomitantly treated with 1 of the following 
categories of medications: multivitamins, specific vitamins, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, ACE inhibitors 
(including  angiotensin  II  antagonists),  emollients  and  protectives,  and  proton  pump  inhibitors.  Other 
classes  of  medications  that  were  frequently  taken  during  the  studies  (approximately  8%  to  9%  of 
subjects)  included  anilides,  progestogens,  propionic  acid  derivatives,  beta  blockers  and  thyroid 
hormones.  
In  the  LTS  study,  concomitant  medications  were  taken  by  85%  of  subjects,  with  the  most  common 
(>10%  of  total  subjects)  being  metronidazole  (70 subjects,  16%),  ibuprofen  (58 subjects,  13%), 
multivitamins,  other  combinations  (56 subjects,  12%),  and  doxycycline  (45 subjects,  10%).  These 
concomitant medications were permitted during the LTS study and were sometimes prescribed for the 
treatment of acne and/or rosacea, specifically metronidazole and doxycycline/minocycline/tetracycline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 94/107 
 
  
  
 
 
Other anti-acne and anti-rosacea preparations taken were azelaic acid (27 subjects, 6%), tetracycline 
(18 subjects, 4%), benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin (1 subject, <1%), tretinoin (3 subjects, 1%), and 
adapalene (1 subject, <1%). 
Other agents used for treatment of acne and/or rosacea were allowed and were taken by about 30% of 
the subjects. Analyses of adverse events in patients treated with other rosacea medications vs. those who 
were not were made and there does not appear to be a potentiation or additive effect with respect to AEs 
above the normal AE profiles anticipated for each drug individually, including local tolerability.

The level of discontinuation due to TEAEs was low. The most common TEAEs resulting in discontinuation 
from  any  study  were  related  to  rosacea  (e.g.  erythema,  flushing),  which  were  mild  or  moderate  in

sensation, skin irritation, contact dermatitis and allergic dermatitis.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Short term risks 
Overall, 1619 subjects were exposed to brimonidine tartrate active gels out of 2174 participants in the 18 
studies  in  the  clinical  development  program.  Of  the  1619  subjects,  1210  subjects  were  exposed  to 
Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel QD, of which 330 subjects were included in the pivotal phase 3 studies and 
the phase 2b study. In the long term safety study, 276 patients were exposed for more than 1 year. Thus, 
an adequate number of patients have been exposed to brimonidine tartrate at the recommended dosage 
and the safety database is in general considered sufficient.  
The  most  common  adverse  events  associated  with  topical  use  of  brimonidine  tartrate  are  erythema, 
pruritus, flushing and skin burning sensation occurring in 1.2 to 3.3% of patients. It is agreed with the 
Applicant  that  concerning  intensity  of  these  local  adverse  reaction  they  are  usually  transient,  mild  to 
moderate in severity, and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment. This is also included in the 
labelling of the product which is supported. 
Erythema and flushing are included in the clinical symptomatology of rosacea, and it is therefore difficult 
to assess if these symptoms are due to lack of efficacy or true adverse events. Pruritus and skin burning 
sensation are common adverse events for topically applied medicinal product, for instance metronidazole, 
and do not raise cause for concern. 
The dermal local tolerance studies showed no detectable phototoxicity or photosensitization potential, low 
contact sensitization potential, and low cumulative irritancy potential for the active formulations and for 
the vehicle, consistent with non-clinical local tolerance studies. In the long term safety study, a few cases 
of contact dermatitis were observed which are included in the labelling of the product. 
It is likely that Brimonidine Tartrate 0.5% Gel will be combined with other  topical treatments i.e. if the 
therapeutic effect is insufficient on the erythema by the use of for example topical metronidazol or azelaic 
acid.  The  revised  SmPC  section  4.2  now  gives  advice  regarding  concomitant  use  with  other  topical 
products intended for the treatment of rosacea. 
Accidental overdose has been reported in two young children of one clinical study subject who mistook the 
study drug for toothpaste. The children experienced symptoms consistent with previously reported oral 
overdoses  of  alpha2-agonists  and  were  reported  to  have  made  a  full  recovery  within  24 hours.  This 
information is included in section 4.9 Overdose of the SmPC. Furthermore, the Applicant has in order to 
avoid repetition of this accident added child resistant closure to the tubes containing brimonidine tartrate, 
which is considered an appropriate measure. 
In  conclusion  on  short  term  risks,  no  other  than  local  adverse  events  are  to  be  anticipated  at  the 
recommended use of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel.  
Potential long term risks 
Brimonidine tartrate has a well kown safety profile and clinical experience in ophtalmic solutions. The 
systemic exposure to brimonidine tartrate following treatment with brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% QD at 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 98/107 
 
  
  
 
the  recommended  dosage  is  similar  to  that  obtained  with  ophtalmic  solutions  containing  brimonidine 
tartrate.  No systemic adverse events were reported in any of the performed studies except those caused 
by accidental oral ingestion and are not to be anticipated at the proposed clinical use. 
There is no preclinical or mechanistic rationale to suspect that brimonidine tartrate  would increase the 
risk  of  cardiovascular  events.  The  thorough  QT  study  (RD.06.SRE.18139)  was  performed  with  ocular 
administration  of  brimonidine  tartrate  and  the  applicant  claims  that  the  study  was  performed  with  a 
supra-therapeutic dose. However, the pharmacokinetic data obtained from this study do not demonstrate 
a  higher  systemic  exposure  compared  with  the  exposure  obtained  with  topical  administration  of 
brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% QD. No adverse effects on cardiovascular parameters were observed which 
are  not  to  be  expected  considering  the  low  systemic  exposure  of  brimonidine  tartrate.  Overall,  no 
treatment related potential risks were observed regarding respiratory, infections/infestations, cardiac, or 
metabolic disorders. 
Brimonidine  tartrate  gel  administered  daily  seems  to  have  little  or  no  effect  on  intra-ocular 
pressure (TEAE IOP increased or decreased) in the target population under short-term or long-term use 
conditions. A change in IOP was not a reason for discontinuation from any study. IOP decreases may have 
been due to inadvertent contamination of the eye with the topical gel.  
The most common local adverse events associated with topical use of brimonidine tartrate are erythema, 
pruritus, flushing and skin burning sensation (see above).  
Subpopulations 
Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  the  potential  differences  of  common  TEAEs  within  a 
subgroup  (gender,  age,  race,  ethnicity)  compared  with  the  entire  study  population.  With  respect  to 
gender, women were observed to report more TEAEs than men, both in the active treatment groups and 
in  the  vehicle  group.  Male  representation  in  studies  was  low  relative  to  females,  consistent  with  the 
incidence of rosacea in the general population. Noted differences in specific TEAE incidences between the 
genders are likely due to normal variability and not indicative of a gender-specific risk. 
Available data do not indicate that subjects ≥65 years of age have an increased risk of adverse events 
when compared to subjects 18 to 64 years of age. However, the number of subjects ≥65 years of age was 
relatively small and the age distribution was not presented. A summary of AEs in geriatric subjects in 
Studies 18161, 18140 and 18141 according to the age categories and AE groupings was provided in the 
question. A statement concerning this observation has been reflected in the SmPC and the PIL in Section 
4.8. No meaningful differences in the safety profile were observed between the elderly subject population 
and subjects 18 to 64 years of age. 
The data presented by the applicant raise no concerns although the number of subjects above 65 years is 
very limited. 
Based  on  the  very  low  number  of  Non-Caucasian  participants,  conclusions  on  AEs  based  on  race  are 
difficult  to  make,  the  condition  affects  mainly  fair  skinned  population  and  therefore  the  use  in 
Non-Caucasian participants would be expected to be low. 
Subjects with rosacea and a preponderance of inflammatory lesions (>10) do not seem at increased risk 
for AEs compared to subjects with few or no concomitant inflammatory lesions. 
In conclusion on potential long term risks, no risks due to systemic uptake of brimonidine tartrate are to 
be anticipated.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile for topical use of brimonidine tartrate is in general considered benign with only local 
adverse events (e.g. erythema, pruritus, flushing and skin burning sensation) that mostly are transient, 
mild to moderate in severity, and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment. 
No  systemic  adverse  events  were  reported  in  any  of  the  performed  studies  except  those  caused  by 
accidental oral ingestion and are not to be expected at the proposed clinical use. 
No long-term safety concerns are foreseen. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
product information. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
The Risk Management Plan is acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan: 
• Safety concerns 
The Applicant states that the most significant identified risk for brimonidine gel 5 mg/g is accidental oral 
ingestion, particularly by children, which may be associated with systemic toxicity. Other identified risks

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Rosacea is a chronic dermatological disease commonly classified into four subtypes based upon clinical 
signs and symptoms. Of these, erythematotelangiectatic and papulopustular rosacea (subtypes 1 and 2) 
both have a presence of persistent erythema of the central portion of the face. Other primary symptoms 
include flushing, papules, pustules and telangiectasias.  
Mirvaso (brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel) targets a single symptom of rosacea, i.e. facial erythema, while 
other rosacea products on the market mainly affect other symptoms of the condition, e.g. by reducing 
inflammatory papules and pustules. There is no European guideline available for products indicated for 
treatment  of  rosacea  and  efficacy  end-points  to  be  used  are  not  clearly  established.  The  applicant 
developed the CEA (Clinician Erythema Assessment) scale and the PSA (Patient Self-Assessment) scales 
that  were  used  as  co-primary  end-points  in  the  pivotal  phase  3  studies  and  phase  2  studies.  The 
development and validation of the CEA and PSA scales have been described and specific studies have 
been performed to address their relevance, e.g. by assessment of inter- and intra-rater agreement and 
content  validity.  The  scales  are  deemed  to  be  sufficiently  described  and  validated  for  their  intended 
purpose.  It  should  be  acknowledged  that  both  the  PSA  and  the  CEA  are  scales  that  are  based  on 
subjective judgements and not objective measures. However, considering the type of condition and the 
intended  use  of  the  product  (symptomatic  reduction  of  erythema  rather  than  curative  treatment), 
assessments made by the patients are of relevance.  
In both pivotal studies, brimonidine tartrate 0.5% gel was significantly superior (p<0.001) compared to 
Vehicle Gel for the primary endpoint (2-grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA at Hours 3, 6, 9, and 
12) on Days 1, 15 and 29. The response rate at different time points on Day 29 ranged between 17.6% 
and 31.5% for brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel and the vehicle response was approximately 10%. 
Brimonidine  Tartrate  0.5%  Gel  produces  effect  rapidly  and  28%  of  the  subjects  in  the  Brimonidine 
Tartrate  0.5%  Gel  group  showed  1-grade  improvement  on  both  the  CEA  and  PSA  at  30 minutes 
post-dosing on Day 1, compared to 5-7% of Vehicle Gel subjects.  
For the tertiary end-point 1-grade Composite Success, brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel was also superior to 
Vehicle Gel, with a response rate ranging from 53.5% to 71% and a vehicle effect of 30-40%.  
Other  subject  self-assessments  generally  supported  the  above  results,  e.g.  the  number  of  subjects 
reporting satisfactory results for Patient Assessment of Appearance (PAA) and Overall Treatment Effect 
(OTE) were higher in the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel groups compared with Vehicle Gel groups. 
No  signs  of  tachyphylaxis  or  rebound  effects  were  observed  and  no  worsening  of  facial  inflammatory 
lesions or telangiectasias occurred as a result of treatment.  
Higher percentages of subjects in the brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel groups were bothered by too much 
whitening (excessive pharmacological effect) compared to the corresponding Vehicle Gel groups (about 
5% vs. 1-3% at each time point on Day 1). However, the number of reports of unwanted over-whitening 
decreased over the course of the studies and no subject discontinued the studies due to over-whitening.  
Brimonidine  tartrate  is  a  topically  applied  product  and  has  a  well  known  safety  profile  and  clinical 
experience from ophthalmic use. The systemic exposure to brimonidine tartrate following treatment with 
brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% QD at the recommended dosage is similar or lower to that obtained with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115246/2014 
Page 104/107 
 
  
  
 
ophthalmic solutions containing brimonidine tartrate.  No systemic adverse events were reported in any 
of the performed studies. There are no concerns for adverse events caused by systemic absorption of 
brimonidine tartrate at the recommended posology of the product. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The efficacy and safety of brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel in patients treated with other topical products for 
the treatment of rosacea, e.g. metronidazole or azelaic acid gel, has not been systematically investigated. 
In clinical practice, a combination of brimonidine tartrate and metronidazole gel is likely, since a rapid 
onset of effect on erythema may be desirable or if metronidazole does not sufficiently reduce erythema. 
In the open-label long-term study, other rosacea treatments were allowed and a fairly large percentage 
of the subjects (n=131, almost 30%) used other topical rosacea products, mainly metronidazole (16 %). 
Efficacy results show roughly similar results for 2-grade composite success for subjects with or without 
concomitant rosacea medication. Also from a safety perspective, concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate 
with other topical rosacea products did not result in safety problems, e.g. related to local tolerability. 
Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC contain adequate information related to the use of brimonidine tartrate 
with other rosacea medications. 
The clinical studies were performed under standardised, experimental conditions that may not reflect the 
environmental factors (sun, cold or wind, exercise, stress, etc) that can cause the erythema of rosacea to 
flare up. Subjects were educated on typical factors that may exacerbate rosacea and were encouraged to 
maintain a consistent lifestyle regarding these factors but were not required to agree to abstain from 
consumption  of  alcohol  or  spicy  food  or  from  exercise  during  the  study  in  order  to  be  eligible.  The 
non-clinic days and the open-label study (which also included the possibility to use together brimonidine 
tartrate with other rosacea medications) are considered to represent real-life conditions. 
For the Overall Treatment Effect (OTE), twice as many subjects in the active treatment group compared 
with the vehicle group considered that their condition had worsened as a result of treatment, though. This 
could have been due to several factors, including small number of subjects, recall bias, and suboptimal 
timing of the administration of the assessment. It seems plausible that in an overall assessment, some 
subjects experienced the wearing off of the effect at the end of the day as a worsening and that this is 
more pronounced in the active than the vehicle group. The overall OTE results showed that the majority 
of patients experienced an improvement with Mirvaso.  
No effect on Quality of life assessments could be shown, but the scales do not appear suitable for this 
indication, since the baseline Quality of life assessments were not poor. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  most  common  adverse  events  associated  with  topical  use  of  brimonidine  tartrate  are  erythema, 
pruritus, flushing and skin burning sensation occurring in 1.2 to 3.3% of patients. Concerning intensity of 
these local adverse reaction they are usually transient, mild to moderate in severity, and usually do not 
require discontinuation of treatment, which is also included in the labelling of the product. 
Pruritus and skin burning sensation are common adverse events for topically applied medicinal products, 
for instance metronidazole gel, and do not raise cause for concern. 
No systemic adverse events were reported in any of the performed studies except those caused by 
accidental oral ingestion and are not to be expected at the proposed clinical use. Pack design has been 
modified to reduce the risk of accidental overdose by children,  the 2 gram sample tube will not have child 
resistant closure however it is expected to be used very quickly (over 1 to 2 days) limiting the amount of 
time during which accidental exposure could occur. Key prevention messages “Do not swallow” and “Keep

out of the sight and reach of children” will be highlighted in red on 2g tubes and carton labels. 
Management of overdose is proposed in Section 4.9 of the SmPC.  
Off  label  use  has  been  added  to  Missing  Information  in  the  Safety  Concerns  with  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation through the product labelling in the SmPC and PIL. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The most common local adverse events associated with topical use of brimonidine tartrate are erythema, 
pruritus, flushing and skin burning sensation, which could be difficult to distinguish from lack of effect. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% provides a significant effect on the erythema of facial rosacea as assessed 
both  by  the  patient  and  the  clinician.  The  onset  of  effect  is  rapid  and the  effect  is  maintained  over a 
12-hour period, although the effect wears off at the later time points. The response rate of 20-30% for 
brimonidine tartrate 0.5% Gel for the primary efficacy end-point (2-grade composite success for PSA and 
CEA)  may  not  be  impressive,  but  is  clearly  above  the  vehicle  response  rate  of  10%  and  is  deemed 
clinically relevant.  The number of subjects reaching 1-grade composite success was clearly higher. Other 
subject self-assessments generally supported the above results.  
No  signs  of  tachyphylaxis  or  rebound  effects  were  observed  and  no  worsening  of  facial  inflammatory 
lesions or telangiectasias occurred as a result of treatment. Limited long-term efficacy data is available 
since the duration of the two pivotal studies was 4 weeks, but a comparison of efficacy results across 
studies has shown a similar level of activity after 28 days and after 1 year of use. These results support 
that efficacy is maintained over time.  
The safety profile is benign with mainly local adverse events like erythema, pruritus, flushing and skin 
burning sensation. These are common adverse events for other topically applied medicinal products, for 
instance metronidazole gel, and do not raise cause for concern.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% has demonstrated a positive symptomatic effect on the erythema of facial 
rosacea, which is deemed clinically relevant.  The data on long-term efficacy are limited but available 
information supports that efficacy is maintained over time. The safety profile is benign with mainly local 
adverse events that are commonly observed for other topically applied rosacea products. Thus, from a 
quality, clinical and non-clinical point of view, the benefits outweigh the risks.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

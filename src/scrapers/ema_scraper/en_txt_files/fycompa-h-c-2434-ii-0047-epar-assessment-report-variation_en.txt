Fycompa includes the active substance perampanel, a potent, non-competitive, and highly selective 
antagonist of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxzaoleproprionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor. 
It was approved in the European Union (EU) through the centralised procedure in July 2012 as 
adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily 
generalized seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older, and as adjunctive therapy for 
the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in adult and adolescent patients 
aged 12 years and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in Jun 2015. The precise 
mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effect has not yet been fully elucidated.

Fycompa is available as film-coated tablets (2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg) and 0.5 
mg/mL oral suspension. Treatment should be initiated by titrating the dose from 2mg/day to a 
maintenance dose of 4 to 8 mg/day, which may be further increased to a maximum dose of 12 
mg/day. Fycompa should be given once daily at bedtime. 
In the current submission, the MAH proposes to extend the approved indications to children aged 2 
years and older. The proposed changes are supported through extrapolation of adult and adolescent 
efficacy and paediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) data derived from 2 open-label studies: an exploratory 
Phase 2 study (Study E2007-G000-232 or Study 232) which included data from subjects from patients 
with epilepsy from 2 to <12 years of age and a pivotal long-term open-label Phase 3 study (Study 
E2007-G000-311 or Study 311) in paediatric patients aged 4 to < 12 years old with inadequately 
controlled POS and PGTC seizures. 
2.1.1.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH received scientific advice from the CHMP on 25 January 2018 
(MEA/H/SA/608/10/2017/PED/II). The scientific advice pertained to clinical aspects in relation to the 
paediatric development of the dossier. 
The main points addressed during the CHMP scientific are summarized hereafter: 
-  The  CHMP  considers  that  there  is  no  sound  evidentiary  basis  to  establish  the  proposed 
extrapolation  concept  (that  matching  PK,  PK/PD  in  children  and  adults  can  predict  efficacy  in 
children). 
That said, it is recognized that only limited efficacy data will be available across relevant strata 
of the target population and so work in this direction is encouraged. PK and PD data in paediatric 
patients with PGTCS of IGE across age groups are needed in sufficient numbers to support PK/PD 
modelling.  
In  addition,  the  proposed  PK  model  needs  to  be  further  substantiated,  with  early  samples  in 
paediatric patients across the age classes that will be included in any indication. The latter may 
be obtained from children with POS. It is not precluded that an improved extrapolation exercise 
together  with  clinical  data  from  study  311  might  suffice  for  assessment  of  efficacy  and  risk-
benefit in children. 
-  The lower limit of age in study 311 is 4 years. No children aged <2 years were included in the meta-
analysis.  Before  2  years  of  age,  the  hyperexcitability  of  the  immature  brain  have  significant 
consequences on the PK and PD resulting in greater variability. Between 2- 4 years, the variability 
in PD response may still remain. Thus, no efficacy data was gained in the claimed indication of 
PGTCS  of  IGE  in  the  2-4  age  group,  consequently,  there  appears  to  be  no  robust  basis  to 
extrapolate down to 2 years of age. Nevertheless, this is ultimately an assessment issue. 
-  The youngest  population  is  considered the  most  difficult  population  to  support  adequately  for 
extrapolation. PK and PD need to be specifically assessed in the youngest children. A ratio of a 
total sample size is a poor basis from a scientific perspective on which to discuss the adequacy of 
the proposed sample size. The CHMP emphasizes that a sufficient number of children aged 4-7 
need  to  be  included  to  provide  information  on  PK  and  PD  in  that  age  range  so  that  robust 
conclusions  can  be  drawn.  It  is  appreciated  that  feasibility  is  also  an  issue  for  consideration  at 
PDCO. 
During the scientific advice, the following points were discussed: 
-  Efficacy:  the  similarity  of  therapeutic  response  cannot  be  ensured,  especially  in  the  youngest 
children,  as  the  brain  is  maturing  until  7  years  of  age  with  different  hyper  or  hypoexcitability 
Assessment report

Page 8/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thresholds depending on the area considered. In addition, the youngest children may also have 
differences in PK. Consequently, the similarity of the exposure/response relationships between 
adults  and  the  different  paediatric  age  class  considered  (2-4,  4-7  and  7-11)  needs  to  be 
demonstrated by the relevant data. 
-  Safety: The most common IGE in children is Childhood Absence Epilepsia (CAE), in which the most 
common  seizure  types  are  absences,  followed  by  myoclonia,  however  PGTCS  can  also,  albeit 
rarely,  be  encountered  in  CAE.  Isolated  PGTCS  are  very  rare  in  children  as  opposed  to  being 
common in adults. 
- 
In children PGTCS appears within more complex syndromes associating different seizure types, the 
effect  of  perampanel  on  these  other  seizure  types  should  be  assessed  within  the  safety 
assessment, at least to rule out a detrimental effect (or quantify it to integrate it into the overall 
benefit/risk assessment). The effect of perampanel on neuropsychological aspects in a developing 
brain  and  on  growth  should  also  be  specifically  assessed  in  the  paediatric  population. 
Consequently, safety cannot be extrapolated. 
In  addition,  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of 
epileptic  disorders  highlights  (CHMP/EWP/566/98  Rev.2/Corr)  is  taken  in  consideration  for  the 
assessment of the paediatric extension of indication, with in particular: 
-  Focal  epilepsies  especially  cryptogenic  and  symptomatic,  and  idiopathic  generalized  epilepsies, 
with  absences,  myoclonic  and/or  generalized  convulsive  seizures,  where  the  efficacy  of  AEDs 
seems  to  be  comparable  in  childhood  and  adulthood.  Focal  epilepsies  in  children  older  than  4 
years  old  have  a  similar  clinical  expression  to  focal  epilepsies  in  adolescents  and  adults.  In 
refractory focal epilepsies, the results of efficacy trials performed in adults could to some extent 
be extrapolated to children provided the dose is established. 
-  From  the  safety  view  point,  a  minimum  of  100  children  treated  by  the  study  drug  should  be 
followed for at least one year. Moreover short term and long-term studies should be designed to 
detect possible impact on brain development, learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine functions 
and puberty. Some of these studies may require continuation in the post marketing period. (See 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in children (CPMP/EWP/462/95). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data other than an updated environmental risk assessment (ERA), have been 
submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment was updated, including a Phase II estimation of exposure:

The  stability  of  perampanel  drug  substance  in  solutions  (pH  2  –  12)  was  investigated 
after storage at 25 °C (light shielded and light irradiated at 1000 lux) and 60 °C (light 
shielded)  for  2  weeks.  The  residual  percentage  of  perampanel  drug  substance  did  not 
change in solutions stored at 25 °C and 60 °C under light shielded conditions. In contrast, 
when  exposed  to  light,  degradation  of  perampanel  drug  substance  was  observed  in 
solutions of various pH values.

Tabular overview of clinical studies:  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
From  the  initial  MAA  dossier,  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  properties  of  Fycompa  (E2007)  in  adults  and 
adolescents are well known and the key properties are summarized below: 
• 
• 
E2007 absorption is rapid and complete (F near 100%) with negligible first-pass metabolism 
E2007  is  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins  (95%),  Vd  in  healthy  volunteers  average  77  L  and 
blood to plasma ratio was 0.55-0.59 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020

• 
• 
E2007  is  extensively  metabolized  via  primary  oxidation  and  sequential  glucuronidation.  The 
metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP3A. Average t1/2 of perampanel was 105 hours, when 
dosed in combination with the strong inducer carbamazepine, the average t1/2 was 25h. 
E2007 exhibit dose linearity between 2 to 12 mg. 
In order to support the proposed paediatric extension of indication, using an extrapolation of adult and 
adolescent efficacy to patients aged 2 years and older, the MAH conducted 2 open-label studies: 
-  an  exploratory  Phase  2  study  (Study  E2007-G000-232  or  Study  232)  which  included  data  from 
subjects from patients with epilepsy from 2 to <12 years of age and, 
-  a  pivotal  long-term  open-label  Phase  3  study  (Study  E2007-G000-311  or  Study  311)  in  paediatric 
patients aged 4 to < 12 years old with inadequately controlled POS and PGTC seizures 
Summary of clinical pharmacology studies in paediatric subjects 
One  population  PK  (popPK)  model  was  developed  using  all  available  PK  data  of  perampanel  (adult, 
adolescent, paediatric and POS or PGTC indications).  
In addition, two population PK/PD (PopPKPD) models (efficacy) were developed for each indication (POS 
and  PGTC)  apart.  For  safety,  graphical  PK/PD  exploration  was  first  performed  followed  by  logistic 
regression analysis. 
Methods 
LC-MS/MS method (Study 311) 
The determination of E2007 in human plasma (sodium heparine) was done using an LC-MS/MS method 
(BTM-1717-R0),  similar to  the  method  BTM-1076-R0  using  at  the  time of  the  initial  MAA  submission. 
Except the sample volume (25 µL) performance of the validated method BTM-1717-R0 were similar to 
that  of  the  initial  BTM-1076-R0  method  in  terms  of  accuracy,  precision,  selectivity,  dilution  integrity, 
reproducibility, matrix effect and stability. The LLOQ was set at 1.0 ng/mL and the ULOQ at 500 ng/mL. 
Five QC levels were considered for the validation method at 1, 3, 50, 380 and 3800 ng/mL, however 
only three were considered for the determination of perampanel PK data from Study 311 (QC at 3, 5, 
380  ng/mL).  For  samples  above  ULOQ  a  10-fold  dilution  was  applied.  Long  term  stability  was 
demonstrated  for  at  least  636  days  stored  at  -20°C.  Incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  performed  and 
showed satisfactory results.

Blood Biological matrix (Study 232) 
A bioanalytical method using dried blood spot (DBS) was developed for the quantification of perampanel 
blood concentration. The blood sample was put on 2 DBS cards (1 original and 1 back-up card). On each 
card there were 4 spots, each was filled with approximately 20µL, giving a total of 80 µL per card. One 
dry blood sample spot (20µL) per time point was analysed using a validated DBS method with LC/MS-
MS method to determine blood concentration. Blood plasma perampanel concentrations were converted 
to plasma concentrations using a blood/plasma ratio of 0.88. 
Performance  of  the  developed  method  are  provided  in  the  table  ‘Summary  of  perampanel  analytical 
method validation in human blood’ hereafter. LLOQ and ULOQ were set at 1 and 500 ng/mL respectively. 
Four QC levels were considered, at 1, 3, 250 and 400 ng/mL with particularly good performance, intra-
run precision (CV%) less than 15% for LLOQ and less than 7% for the others QC; and inter-run precision 
(CV%) less than 10%. Long term stability was demonstrated at 363 days at room temperature.

Summary of perampanel analytical method validation in human blood 
Incurred sample reanalysis showed satisfactory results according to the applicant with 72% of the ISR 
which met the acceptance criteria (+/- 20%);  
Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic analysis 
Population PK (PopPK) and PK/PD (PopPKPD) analysis were performed with Nonmem® software (version 
7.3.0). The analyses consisted of a PopPK model for perampanel on data from all subjects (paediatric, 
adolescent  and  adult  populations)  whatever  the  indication  (POS  or  PGTC),  and  several  continuous 
PopPKPD model developed for each indication.  
Analysis  were  conducted  using  the  FOCEI  (PopPK  model)  and  FOCE  or  Laplacian  method  (PopPKPD 
models). Covariate selection was based on a standard stepwise forward/backward procedure. Final model

evaluation consisted of several GOF (Goodness of fit) plots, predictive performance was evaluated using 
VPC, pc-VPC and model validation using a bootstrap analysis. 
However since the extrapolation exercise is based on PK only, results from the PopPK/PD models for 
both indication POS and PGTC are not presented hereafter. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study 232 
This was a multicenter, multiple ascending dose, open-label study with an Extension Phase conducted 
to evaluate the PK and to generate preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy data for perampanel oral 
suspension when given as an adjunctive therapy in paediatric subjects from 2 to <12 years of age with 
epilepsy.  Subjects  were  enrolled  into  2  cohorts  depending  upon  age  at  the  time  of  consent/assent: 
Cohort 1 consisted of subjects from 7 to <12 years of age and Cohort 2 consisted of subjects from 2 to 
<7 years of age (please also refer to 2.4.1. Clinical efficacy/Main Studies for additional details).  
Study 311 
This was a multicenter, open-label single-arm study in children (aged 4 to <12 years) with inadequately 
controlled POS or PGTC seizures. The study consisted of a Core Study and Extension Phase (Extension 
A) for subjects globally with an additional Extension Phase (Extension B) available for subjects enrolled 
in Japan and countries where an extended access program could not be implemented. Subjects were 
stratified by age (≥4 to <7 years, 7 to <12 years) with at least 30% of subjects planned to be enrolled 
in the ≥4 to <7 year age group for each seizure type (ie, at least 36 with POS and at least 12 with PGTC 
seizures). (please also refer to 2.4.1. Clinical efficacy/Main Studies for additional details).

Population Pharmacokinetic Model  
Two  Pop  PK  model  reports,  CPMS-E2007-007R-v1  and  CPMS-E2007-015R-v2,  were  provided.  Since 
CPMS-E2007-007R-v1  have  been 
reviewed 
twice 
following  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/330293/2015, 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/330294/2015  and  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/17398/2018  from  which  several  issues  were 
highlighted, the MAH performed a new PopPK model in CPMS-E2007-015R-v2 which was subsequently 
updated in CPMS-E2007-015-v3 which is detailed here after.  
PK dataset 
A summary of the PK dataset is presented in following table, where PK data from Study 232 were not 
accounted for due to analytical issues. 
Summary of number of subjects and observation records in Population PK dataset 
For the paediatric population (Study 311), PK data consisted of sparse PK sampling at several occasions, 
1 blood sample for the determination of plasma perampanel concentrations during Visits 7, (Week 15), 
8 (Week 19), and 9 (Week 23) and at early discontinuation. 
- 
For studies performed in the adult and adolescent population, PK data consisted of rich PK sampling (20 
Phase  1  studies)  performed  in  healthy  subjects  and  sparse  PK  sampling  at  steady  state  at  several 
occasions (Studies 235, 304, 305, 306, 332 and 335). 
Therefore, for: 
- 
- 
the  POS  indication,  paediatric  PK  information  consisted  of  n=373  observations  from  130 
paediatric subjects vs n =6415 observations from 1359 adult and adolescent subjects. 
the PGTC indication, paediatric PK information consisted of n=73 observations from 26 paediatric 
subjects vs n =205 observations from 73 adult and adolescent subjects. 
Healthy subjects account for n= 17548 observations for 706 subjects. 
The table below presents a summary of the baseline characteristics of the studied populations. Only n=4 
paediatric subjects were aged 2 to < 4 years (Study 232), n= 59 aged 4 to < 7 years, and n=135 aged 
7 to < 12 years against n=1432 aged > 12 years.

 Summary of co-administered AEDs 
Results 
A  population  PK  model  for  perampanel  was  previously  developed  using  pooled  data  from 20  Phase  1 
studies in healthy subjects. Perampanel was best described by a 2 compartment model with first order 
absorption and linear elimination parameterized in terms of CL/F, V2/F, Q/F and V3/F, Ka and ALAG1 
(lag-time  in  absorption).  Since  HS  received  the  tablet  or  the  suspension  formulation  in  the 
presence/absence of food, Ka was parameterized accordingly. IIV were estimated on all PK parameters 
except ALAG1. RUV was modelled using a combined error model (proportional and additive). Results of 
the PK parameter estimates are provided in followingError! Reference source not found..

In the current analysis, this PK model was used as a starting point for PK model development with pooled 
data from all the available clinical studies (Phase 1, 2 and 3). Several steps were considered to build the 
Base PK model (all data), implementation of IOV on CL/F and fixed allometric scaling coefficient of 0.75 
for CL/F for patients under 18 years old as shown in the following table.

Summary of base PK model building for perampanel (All data) 
According to the MAH, since eta-shrinkage on CL/F was particularly low (-6.41 %) but above 50% for 
other  parameters,  covariate-parameter  relationships  were  only  tested  on  CL/F  with  all  available 
covariates.  
Using  univariate  analysis  following  graphical  exploration  of  ETA-CL/F  vs  covariates,  gender,  ,  black-
african race, type of seizure (POS or PGTC) and population (healthy vs patient) were first tested prior to 
the evaluation of the effect of concomitant AED administration on CL/F. Then after backward elimination 
the effects of gender and phenobarbital/topiramate, phenytoine/oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine was 
retained in the final model. Final PK parameter estimates are provided in the following table.

Overall PK parameters were estimated with a good precision (RSE <10%).  
The final population PK model for perampanel contained the statistically significant effects of body weight 
on V2/F, Q/F and V3/F with fixed allometric scaling for all subjects and on CL/F for subjects aged < 18 
years  of  age  only, 
sex  and 
the 
concomitant  medications  of  AEDs 
carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine/phenytoin,  and  topiramate/phenobarbital  (significant  AEDs),  on  perampanel  CL/F. 
Carbamazepine resulted in a 3.04-fold increase in CL/F whereas co-administration of oxcarbazepine or 
phenytoin  resulted  in  1.97-fold  increases  in  CL/F.  Co-administration  of  topiramate  or  phenobarbital 
increases perampanel CL/F by 1.22-fold. CL/F was 18.5% lower in females compared to males. These 
results are consistent with those from previous analyses. In the final PK model, the basal estimate for 
CL/F was slightly lower in subjects < 18 years old compared to adults (0.613 vs 0.646 L/h).

Simulation  to  assess  PK  extrapolation  to  PEDIATRIC  subjects  aged  4  to  <  12  years  and  Dosing 
recommendations 
To  further  assess  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  the  exposure  to  perampanel  during  the  maintenance 
period  (i.e.,  at  steady  state)  PK  simulations  in  subjects  aged  <  18  years  were  performed,  using 
parameter estimates from the final PK model (N=100), for subjects at body weights of < 20 kg, 20 to < 
30 kg, 30 to < 40 kg, 40 to < 60 kg and   60 kg, based on median weights within these ranges from the 
actual population PK analysis dataset. 
The median bodyweights used for the simulations for the following body weight categories < 20 kg, 20 
to  <  30  kg,  30  to  <  40  kg,  40  to  <  60  kg  and  ≥  60  kg  were  18.5,  24.4,  36.2,  53.0  and  74.4  kg, 
respectively. 
Simulations were performed based on dosing during maintenance dosing of 4 mg and 6 mg perampanel 
once daily to subjects < 20 kg body weight, 6 mg and 8 mg perampanel once daily to subjects 20 to < 
30 kg bodyweight and 8 mg perampanel once daily to all other subjects. Simulations were performed by 
using parameter estimates from the final PK model. 
Based on the simulations for body weight group, descriptive statistics of model derived AUCss, Css,max 
and Css,min for each body weight/dose category were determined and are presented in the following 
table. In addition, box and whisker plots for model derived AUCss, Css,max and Css,min for each body 
weight/dose category are presented in the figure below.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic of perampanel has been well characterized in adult patients   
The  proposed  extension  of  the  indication  in  the  pediatric  population  (2  to  <  12  years)  have  been 
addressed according to the paediatric investigation part of perampanel clinical development. In support 
of an extrapolation of adult and adolescent efficacy to patients aged 2 to < 12 years, the MAH conducted 
an  exploratory  Phase  2  study  (Study  232)  in  patients  aged 2  to  <12  years  with  POS  or  PGTC,  and  a 
pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 311) in patients aged 4 to < 12 years with POS or PGTC. 
Both  Study  232  and  Study  311  used  validated  micromethods  to  measure  perampanel  concentration, 
however  two  bioanalytical  methods  were  developed.  A  DBS  method  for  Study  232  was  used  where 
perampanel concentration was quantified in human blood samples, then concentration in human plasma 
was  derived  using  a  blood  plasma  ratio  factor  of  0.88  which  appear  far  from  that  determined  by  a 
dedicated in vitro study method (initial MAA) of 0.55. In addition to this discrepancy, the DBS method 
claimed  to  be  reproducible,  seems  not.  Therefore  the  validity  of  the  PK  data  from  study  232  was 
questioned,  two  concerns  was  raised  from  which  no  clear  evidence  was  provided  by  the  applicant  to 
definitively  consider  these  PK  data  as  reliable  as  claimed.  A  conventional  bioanalytical  method  was 
applied for Study 311 and this method show satisfactory results and is considered validated. 
Initially a population PK model using PK data from 20 Phase 1 studies in adults, 6 Phase 2/3 in adult and 
adolescent patients, and the two studies in the paediatric population (Study 232 and Study 311) was 
developed (Report CPMS-E2007-015R-v2). Overall, the developed PK model seemed to fit for purpose, 
however several uncertainties remained with regards to the covariate screening procedure, the weight 
effect on clearance and its predictive performance particularly. These issues appeared critical since an 
adequate PopPK model is needed to support extrapolation From that PK model, a simulation study was 
performed using individual derived exposure parameters of perampanel. To allow a comparison between 
groups of different age strata the MAH have proposed a metric, the dose normalized AUCss at 8 mg. 
From  that  analysis  a  clear  over-exposure  was  predicted  in  the  age  group  4  to  <7  years  vs  above  18 
years as shown below suggesting that a weight effect on clearance should be accounted for. 
As second Population PK model was therefore requested where PK data from Study 232 were asked to 
be discarded, and weight effect on clearance should be accounted for only in the pediatric population 
<18 years (Report CPMS-E2007-015R-v3). The main result from that analysis was the clear weight effect 
on perampanel clearance from which a dosing schedule in the paediatric population aged 4 to <12 years 
based on body weight group (< 20 kg, 20-30 kg and > 30 kg) was proposed and accepted. 
Only 4 patients aged 2 < 4 years with 4 PK observations were included in Study 232. These patients 
received  perampanel  dose  up  to 2.5  mg  which  are considered  far  from  the  target  dose  of  8  mg.  The 
paucity of the PK data and PD data (efficacy/safety) in this age group associated to the uncertainties 
associated to the quantification method are not in favor to use a full or a partial extrapolation approach 
at this stage. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Following a wealth population PK analysis, the MAH proposal to use a dosing schedule in the paediatric 
Assessment report

population  aged  4  to  <12  years  based  on  body  weight  group  (<  20  kg,  20-30  kg  and  >  30  kg)  is 
acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
Study E2007-G000-232 
Methods 
This study is a multicenter, multiple ascending dose, open-label study with an extension phase conducted 
to  evaluate  PK  and  to  generate  preliminary  safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  data  for  perampanel  oral 
suspension when given as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients from 2 to <12 years of age with a 
diagnosis of epilepsy with any type of seizure according to the International League Against Epilepsy's 
(ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures., including patients with PGTC of IGE (n=3).  
Patients were enrolled into 2 cohorts depending upon age at the time of consent/assent:  
-  Cohort 1 consisted of patients 7 to <12 years of age, 
-  Cohort 2 consisted of patients 2 to <7 years of age. 
The Core Study consisted of 2 phases: 
-  Pretreatment  Phase:  The  Pretreatment  Phase  lasted  up  to  2  weeks  in  duration,  during  which 
patients were assessed for their eligibility to participate in the study. 
-  Treatment Phase: The Treatment Phase consisted of 3 periods: Titration (7 weeks), Maintenance 
(4 weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks; for those patients not rolling over to the Extension Phase of 
the study, for those patients who early terminate from the study, and for all patients completing 
the Extension Phase). 
o  Titration  
During the 7-week Titration Period, patients received perampanel oral suspension once daily. Patients 
started at a set daily dose of 0.015 mg/kg and had  doses up-titrated at 1-week intervals (6 titration 
steps) to a maximum daily dose of 0.18 mg/kg or until the maximum tolerated dose based on tolerability 
was reached. The maximum total daily dose a patient will be allowed is 12 mg. 
Doses  are  based  on  mg/kg  of  body  weight  and  calculated  from  adult  doses  assuming  an  adult  body 
weight of 70 kg 
Starting dose (Week 0) -Visit 2 - 0.015 mg/kg ~ (1 mg/70 kg) 
Titration #1 (Week 1) -Visit 3- 0.03 mg/kg ~ (2 mg/70 kg) 
Titration #2 (Week 2) - (no visit) - 0.06 mg/kg ~ (4 mg/70 kg) 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 29/80 
 
 
 
 
 
Titration #3 (Week 3) - Visit 4 - 0.09 mg/kg ~ (6 mg/70 kg) 
Titration #4 (Week 4) - (no visit) - 0.12 mg/kg ~ (8 mg/70 kg) 
Titration #5 (Week 5) - Visit 5- 0.15 mg/kg ~ (10 mg/70 kg) 
Titration #6 (Week 6) - (no visit) - 0.18 mg/kg ~ (12 mg/70 kg) 
At the completion of the Titration Period, patients began the Maintenance Period of the Treatment Phase. 
o  Maintenance/Follow-Up 
During the 4-week Maintenance Period, patients continued taking perampanel oral suspension once daily 
at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period.  
Patients continued taking this dose level QD for the duration of the Maintenance Period of the Treatment 
Phase. 
Patients who did not roll over into the Extension Phase or those who discontinued from the study were 
required  to  complete  the  Follow-up  Period  4  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  treatment,  as  part  of  the 
Treatment Phase of the Core Study. During this period, patients did not receive study drug. 
-  Extension Phase 
All patients who completed all scheduled visits up to and including the final visit of the Treatment Phase 
(Visit 8) were eligible to participate in the Extension Phase of the study. 
The Extension Phase consisted of 2 periods: Maintenance (41 weeks) and Follow-up (4 weeks). 
Patients continued taking perampanel oral suspension once daily at the dose level achieved at the end 
of  the  Treatment  Phase.  The  maximum  daily  dose  level  patients  could  receive  was  0.18  mg/kg;  the 
maximum  total  daily  dose  a  patient  was  allowed  was  12  mg.  For  patients  who  rolled  over  into  the 
Extension Phase, the last visit of the Maintenance Period in the Treatment Phase of the Core Study was 
the first visit of the Extension Phase.  
During the Extension Phase, changes of concomitant AEDs (addition, deletion, or adjustment in dose) 
were allowed. However, if changes did occur, patients were to be carefully monitored, especially when 
switching between an inducer AED (ie, EIAED) and a non-inducer AED (ie, non-EIAED). 
Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria were male or female, from 2 to <12 years of age, had a diagnosis of epilepsy 
with any type of seizure according to the ILAE Classification of Epileptic Seizures. Diagnosis should have 
been established at least 6 months prior to Visit 1, by clinical history and an EEG that was consistent 
with  epilepsy;  normal  interictal  EEGs  were  allowed  provided  that  the  patient met  the  other  diagnosis 
criterion (ie, clinical history), had not a progressive cause of epilepsy and had 1 or more seizure(s) during 
the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 
Regarding treatment, they had been on their current concomitant AED regimen for 2 months or more 
with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and no more than half of patients in each age 
cohort were allowed to be treated with stable doses of 1 perampanel -inducing AED (ie, carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin). 
Choice of patient population / Sample size 
It was planned to enroll approximately 48 male and female patients from 2 to <12 years of age who had 
a diagnosis of epilepsy with any type of seizure according to the International League Against Epilepsy's 
(ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures. Patients who did not meet all the inclusion criteria or who met 
any of the exclusion criteria were not eligible to receive study drug. 
Treatments 
Perampanel was administered orally and once daily. Dosing occurred at bedtime. 
Dosing  and  administration  of  perampanel  in  Study  232  was  based  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  data 
obtained for perampanel doses up to 12 mg/day studied in patients (12 years and above) with refractory 
POS in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 studies: Study 304 and 
Study 305 (8 and 12 mg/day perampanel) and Study 306 (2, 4, and 8 mg/day perampanel).

Objectives 
Primary objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of perampanel in pediatric patients (age 2-11 years) 
with refractory epilepsy as adjunctive therapy. 
Secondary objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of perampanel as well as its efficacy given 
as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (age 2-11) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: PK 
The population PK/PD approach will be used to explore the exposure-response relationship for efficacy 
and most frequent AE(s). 
Main secondary endpoints: safety and efficacy 
-  Safety assessments: AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory values, vital with time(s) of assessment signs, 
ECGs, physical and neurological examinations, and photosensitivity questionnaire. Growth will 
be assessed by measurement of height and weight, and by thyroid and insulin-like growth factor-
1 (IGF-1) testing. A suicidality scale questionnaire (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-
SSRS])  will  also  be  administered  for  patients  aged  6  years  and  older  at  the  time  of 
consent/assent. 
-  Exploratory Efficacy Variables: Percentage change in seizure frequency compared to the baseline 
and the proportion of responders, seizure-free status, and clinical global impression of change.

Statistical methods 
For the Core Study, summary statistics were displayed for all efficacy parameters.  
The FAS (full analysis set) was the group of patients who received study drug, had any seizure frequency 
data during the 2-week Pretreatment Phase plus the 4 weeks prior to the Pretreatment Phase, and during 
the Treatment Phase. 
For the Extension Phase, all efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS, defined as all patients who 
took  at  least  1  dose  of  perampanel  during  the  Extension  Phase,  and  had  any  seizure  frequency  data 
during the 2-week Pretreatment Phase plus the 4 weeks prior to Pretreatment Phase of the Core Study 
and had any seizure frequency data during the Extension Phase. 
For this study, the efficacy seizure endpoints were the percent change in 28-day seizure frequency during 
treatment compared to baseline, responder rate during the Maintenance Period, and seizure-free status 
during the Maintenance Period.  
The  baseline  28-day  seizure  frequency  for  the  primary  analyses  used  seizure  data  from  the  2-week 
Pretreatment Phase. 
The  responder  rate  during  the  Maintenance  Period  used  the  last  observation  carried  forward-type 
imputation.  
The seizure-free status during the Maintenance Period was only calculated for patients who completed 
the Maintenance Period (ie, those who completed the Core Study). 
CGIC scores at end of treatment (EOT) were summarized. The EOT value was the last non-missing value 
while on-treatment.

Study E2007-G000-311 
Methods 
This study is an ongoing multicenter, open-label single-arm study in children (ages ≥4 to <12 years) 
with inadequately controlled POS or PGTCS receiving 1 to 3 other AEDs.  
The study consists of a Core Study and Extension Phase.  
-  Pre-treatment phase 
The  Pretreatment  Phase  consisted  of  a  Screening/Baseline  Period  that  lasted  up  to  4  weeks  ±3  days 
outside  of  Japan.  Patients  in  Japan  were  required  to  complete  4  full  weeks  ±3  days  of  the 
Screening/Baseline Period. Patients were stratified by age range (≥4 to <7 years, 7 to <12 years) with 
at least 30% of patients planned to be enrolled in the ≥4 to <7 year age group for each seizure type (ie, 
at least 36 with POS and at least 12 with PGTCS). 
-  Treatment phase 
The duration of the Treatment Phase was up to 27 weeks and included 3 periods: Titration (up to 11 
weeks), Maintenance (up to 12 weeks), and Follow-up (up to 4 weeks; only for those patients who did 
not roll over into the Extension Phase). 
o  Titration 
During the Titration Period, patients were stratified by the presence or absence of concomitant EIAEDs.  
The perampanel dose was titrated up to 16 mg per day whether an EIAED is administered.  
The  Titration  Period  had  a  duration of  up  to  11  weeks,  during which  multiple  dose  adjustments  were 
allowed  in  order  to  identify  each  patient’s  optimum  dose.  All  visits  were  done  within  ±3  days  of  the 
schedule. 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 32/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According  to  the  investigator’s  clinical  judgment,  patients  who  experienced  intolerability  at  any  dose 
remained at the same dose or had their dose decreased 1 dose level down to the previously tolerated 
dose.  Multiple  dose  adjustments  were  allowed  during  the  Titration  Period.  Upon  completion  of  the 
Titration Period, patients entered the Maintenance Period. 
o  Maintenance 
During the Maintenance Period, patients continued taking perampanel oral suspension once daily at the 
dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period. Multiple dose adjustments were allowed if a 
patient experienced intolerable AE(s) or a higher dose was deemed to be beneficial.  
During the Titration and Maintenance Periods, all dose adjustments were done via one dose level up or 
down.  Patients  who  could  not  tolerate  a  minimum  of  a  2-mg  dose  must  have  discontinued  from  the 
study. 
-  Follow-up/Extension phase 
All patients who completed all scheduled visits up to and including Visit 9 of the Core Study were eligible 
to participate in Extension phase. 
Extension phase consisted of a Maintenance Period (up to 29 weeks) and a Follow-up Period (up to 4 
weeks).  
During  the  Maintenance  Period  of  Extension  phase,  patients  continued  with  their  optimal  perampanel 
dose (ie, the dose level the patients maintained at the completion of the Core Study). 
Addition, deletion, and dose changes to concomitant AEDs were allowed during the Maintenance Period 
of Extension phase. Conversion-to-monotherapy on perampanel was also permitted at the discretion of 
the investigator, if it was considered appropriate to maintain seizures control. 
Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria were male or female, from 4 to <12 years of age, with a diagnosis of epilepsy 
with POS with or without SG seizures or PGTCS according to the ILAE Classification of Epileptic Seizures 
(1981). Diagnosis should have been established at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 by clinical history and 
an EEG that was consistent with the diagnosis; normal interictal EEGs were allowed provided that the 
patient met the other diagnosis criterion (ie, clinical history). They had a minimum weight of 16 kg (35 
lb). A progressive cause of epilepsy was ruled out. During the 12 weeks ±3 days prior to Visit 2, patients 
must have had ≥1 POS or 1 PGTC seizure. Only simple POS with motor signs, complex POS, and complex 
POS with secondary generalization were counted toward this inclusion for POS. 
Regarding the treatment, they had been on stable doses of 1 to a maximum of 3 approved AEDs. Doses 
must have been stable for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1; in the case where a new AED regimen was 
initiated for a patient, the dose must have been stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. Only 1 EIAED 
(defined  as  carbamazepine,  phenytoin,  oxcarbazepine,  or  eslicarbazepine)  out  of  the  maximum  of  3 
AEDs was allowed (a vagal nerve stimulator was counted as 1 of the 3 allowed AEDs). 
Treatments 
Perampanel was administered orally and once daily. Dosing occurred at bedtime. 
Patients will be stratified by concomitant use of enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs EIAEDs: 
1) The starting dose for patients not on concomitant EIAEDs is 2 mg/day with a titration one week later 
to 4 mg/day, followed by biweekly titration steps to 6 mg/day, 8 mg/day 10 mg/day and 12 mg/day, or 
until MTD is reached. 
2) The starting dose for patients on concomitant EIAEDs is 4 mg/day followed by weekly titration to 6 
mg/day  and  8  mg/day,  followed  by  biweekly  titration  to  10  mg/day,  12  mg/day,  14  mg/day  and  16 
mg/day or until MTD is reached. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of perampanel oral suspension when administered as an adjunctive 
therapy in children (age 4 to <12 years) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures (POS) or 
primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures. 
Secondary Objectives

-  1.  To  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  perampanel  and  the  relationship  between 
perampanel plasma concentrations, efficacy, and safety using population PK/pharmacodynamics 
(PD) modeling 
-  2. To evaluate the effects of perampanel on cognition, behavior, visuomotor skills, and growth and 
development in children during short-term (23 weeks) and long-term (up to 52 weeks) treatment 
-  3. To evaluate the frequency of EEG abnormalities during awake and sleep state during 52 weeks 
of treatment 
-  4. To evaluate suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior in children 6 years to <12 years as measured 
by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) during 52 weeks of treatment 
-  5. To evaluate the efficacy of perampanel as measured by the median percent change per 28 days 
in  seizure  frequency,  by  the  proportion  of  responders  (≥25%,  ≥50%,  and  ≥75%),  and  by  the 
proportion of patients who were seizure-free for POS, PGTC, and Generalized Tonic-Clonic seizures 
-  6. To assess the effects of perampanel on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), as measured by CGI 
of Change (CGIC) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
Seizure diaries were used to collect daily seizure counts. All seizure types were counted. 
PK 
Plasma  concentrations  of  perampanel  were  determined  via  collection  of  blood  samples  during  the 
Maintenance Phase using a sparse sampling technique at specified visits for subsequent population PK 
analysis.(See PK part of this report) 
Safety 
The safety and tolerability includes incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs, 
laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG parameters of perampanel oral suspension in children (age 
4 to <7 years and ≥7 years to <12 years) with POS or PGTC. 
Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Additional assessments included regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values, 
regular measurements of vital signs, ECGs, and physical and neurological examinations. 
Growth and development were assessed by weight, height, thyroid function tests, and insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1). 
For  cognitive  testing  AldenKamp-Baker  neuropsychological  assessment  schedule  [ABNAS],  behavioral 
questionnaires  (Child  Behavior  Checklist  [CBCL]),  and  visuomotor  skills  testing  using  the  Lafayette 
Grooved 
Pegboard Test (LGPT) were performed. 
An assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior using the C-SSRS was performed throughout the study 
for patients aged 6 years and older at the time of consent/assent. Suicidal ideation and behavior was 
monitored in patients less than 6 years at the time of consent/assent based upon clinical impression. 
An EEG was performed over a minimum of 1-hour up to a 2-hour period in an awake and sleep state at 
specified visits. 
The CGI (CGI Severity at Baseline Visit and CGI Change [CGIC] at subsequent visits) was assessed.

Statistical methods 
The  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  with  respect  to  baseline  assessment  was 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, minimum and maximum): 
-  by age cohorts : 4 to <7 years, ≥7 to <12 years),  
-  by disease cohorts : POS, PGTCS, SGTC seizures (a subset of the POS cohort, patients who had 
complex partial seizures with SGTC seizures at baseline),  
-  by the presence or absence of concomitant EIAED.  
Seizure types within each disease cohort are defined as follows: 
• POS cohort: 
- Total seizures, defined as the sum of all seizures, including POS, generalized and other seizures. 
- Total POS defined as the sum of all POS, including simple partial seizures without motor signs, 
simple partial seizures with motor signs, complex partial seizures, and complex partial seizures 
with SG;  
- Total complex partial seizures. 
• The SGTC subset of the POS cohort: Complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. 
• PGTC cohort: 
- Total seizures, defined as the sum of all seizures, including PGTCS, absence seizures, myoclonic 
seizures, and other seizures; 
- Tonic-clonic seizures 
- Absence seizures 
- Myoclonic seizures 
Patients  who  completed  the  core  study  and  had  no  seizures  during  the  maintenance  period  were 
considered seizure-free.  
The proportion of patients who were seizure-free and the proportion of responders based on decrease 
from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency of ≥50% were summarized using frequency count (number 
and percentage) by age cohorts (4 to <7 years, ≥7 to <12 years), by disease cohorts (POS, PGTCS, and 
SGTC seizures), and by the presence or absence of concomitant EIAED in the FAS. 
The CGIC  was summarized using frequency count (number and percentage) by age cohorts (4 to <7 
years, ≥7 to <12 years), by disease cohorts (POS, PGTCS, and SGTC seizures), and by the presence or 
absence of concomitant EIAED in the FAS.

Core study 
For the Core Study, it was planned to enroll approximately 48 male and female patients from 2 to <12 
years of age who had a diagnosis of epilepsy.  
Approximately 60 patients were screened with an aim to enroll at least 48 evaluable patients into 2 age-
matched cohorts with approximately 24 patients each (patients from ≥7 to <12 years of age and patients 
from ≥2 to <7 years of age).  
Patients were enrolled at 15 centers in North America and were assigned to a single treatment group: 
perampanel oral suspension.  
A total of 50 patients were treated with perampanel: 22 patients 2-7 years, and 28 patients 7-12 years).  
There were 3 patients in this study with PGTC of IGE (1 in Cohort 2 and 2 in Cohort 1).

Study 232 
In  the  Study  232  Extension  Phase,  efficacy  was  measured  using  the  same  endpoints  as  in  the  Core 
Study.  
Of the 42 patients who completed the Core Study, a total of 41 patients continued into the Extension 
Phase (22 patients in Cohort 1 and 19 patients in Cohort 2). 
The 3 patients with PGTC of IGE completed the Core Study and entered the Extension Phase, but did not 
complete it due to patient choice (1 patient) and unable to adhere to study protocol (2 patients).

Analysis performed across trials (meta-analysis) 
In  addition  to  studies  232  and  311,  the  Applicant  submitted  a  meta-analysis  of  the  literature  to 
substantiate the possibility of extrapolating efficacy from adults to paediatric patients with PGTCS. 
Objective of this meta-analysis: 
A  meta-analysis  of  published  studies  was  performed  to  determine  whether  the  efficacy  of  AEDs  in 
adolescents and adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) could be used to predict 
the efficacy of some AEDs in the pediatric population (4 – 11 years of age) with PGTCS. 
Results from this meta-analysis provided by the MAH:  
Efficacy measures were consistent between adults and children with PGTCS among the 7 adjunctive drug 
therapy trials for lamotrigine (LTG), topiramate (TPM), and perampanel. The median percent change in 
reduction of PGTCS frequency between drug and placebo was consistently in favor of the drug treatment 
group across trials and similar between the children and adult subgroups. Furthermore, the estimated 
risk  ratios  in  the  50%  or  greater  responder  rate  between  drug  and  placebo  groups  were  comparable 
between the children and adult subgroups consistently favored the drug group across trials. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
For the current submission, the MAH proposes to extend the approved Fycompa indications to children 
aged  2  years  and  older  through  extrapolation  of  adult  and  adolescent  efficacy  data  to  the  paediatric 
population. 
The extrapolation of perampanel efficacy in adults to the paediatric population is mainly supported by 
clinical data from two clinical studies: 
-  Study  311:  a  phase  3  open-label,  uncontrolled  trial,  performed  to  assess  the  exposure-efficacy 
relationship of perampanel as adjunctive therapy in 180 paediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years old) with 
inadequately controlled POS or PGTC seizures. Patients were titrated over 11 weeks to a target dose of 
8  mg/day  or  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (not  to  exceed  12  mg/day)  for  patients  not  taking  EIAED 
(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine and phenytoin) or 12 mg/day or the maximum tolerated 
dose (not to exceed 16 mg/day) for patients taking an EIAED. 
- Study 232: a phase 2 pilot, open-label, uncontrolled, ascending-dose trial, performed to evaluate the 
PK  and  preliminary  safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  perampanel  oral  suspension  when  given  as  an 
adjunctive therapy in paediatric patients (≥2 to <12 years) with epilepsy.  
In the main study 311, in the POS cohort (n=148), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days 
was -40.1%, the 50% or greater responder rate was 46.6%, and seizure-free rate was 11.5%. In the 
SGTCS cohort (n=54, subset of the POS cohort), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days 
was -58.7%, the 50% or greater responder rate was 64.8%, and seizure-free rate was 18.5%.  
In the PGTCS cohort (n=22), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days was -69.2%, the 50% 
or greater responder rate was 63.6%, and seizure-free rate was 54.5%. Similar results were obtained 
in a subset of patients with PGTCSs in IGE (56.5%, 63.2%, and 52.6%, respectively). Considering the 
small number of patients, these results should however be considered cautiously. 
For both studies 311 and 232, for up to nearly 1 year, efficacy was observed during the extension phase: 
the  rate of  median  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days,  the  50%  or  greater  responder  rate  and 
Assessment report

seizure-free rate were overall consistent with those observed during the maintenance phase of the core 
studies. However, these results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients decreased 
gradually until the end of the extension phases. 
Some  factors  like  the  number  of  baseline  AED  and  the  administration  of  EIAED  were  assessed  and 
although the efficacy showed a reduction with the number of baseline associated AEDs as well as with 
the concomitant administration of inducer drugs, the observed efficacy results are consistent with those 
observed during the core studies. However, these results should also be considered cautiously because 
of the open-label trial design. 
In  line  with  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  epileptic 
disorders  (CHMP/EWP/566/98  Rev.2/Corr)  and  the  statement  ‘Focal  epilepsies  especially  cryptogenic 
and  symptomatic,  and  idiopathic  generalized  epilepsies,  with  absences,  myoclonic  and/or  generalized 
convulsive seizures, where the efficacy of AEDs seems to be comparable in childhood and adulthood. 
Focal epilepsies in children older than 4 years old have a similar clinical expression to focal epilepsies in 
adolescents and adults. In refractory focal epilepsies, the results of efficacy trials performed in adults 
could to some extent be extrapolated to children provided the dose is established’, it is agreed that the 
efficacy in POS for children from 4-year-old could be extrapolated from the results in adults, provided 
the dosing regimen is established and justified. 
Initially, there were uncertainties on the dosing scheme for patients. These were subsequently resolved 
and the dose in the various age groups determined as a weight-based dose for three weight categories: 
<20kg, 20 to < 30 kg and > 30 kg (see Discussion on clinical pharmacology above). 
Although  the  efficacy  data  show  a  positive  effect  on  the  median  seizure  frequency  reduction,  on  the 
responder rate and on the seizure-free status in the POS cohort, in the SGTCS subset of the POS cohort 
and in the PGTCS cohort for both age groups (2 to <7 years and 7 to <12 years), these efficacy results 
from both single-arm open labelled studies remain only of supportive nature. Further data were therefore 
provided and discussed.  
The CHMP considered that for the treatment of POS and SGTCS, the clinical efficacy observed through 
descriptive data from study 311 was overall reassuring. The efficacy results could be considered clinically 
meaningful for both age cohorts (4 to <7 years and 7 to<12 years). The efficacy between adults and 
children > 4 years of age in the treatment of POS and SGTCS seems comparable and acceptable from a 
clinical point of view. In line with the guideline, the effect of perampanel on POS, with or without SGTCS, 
could be extrapolated from adults to children > 4 years of age, provided the dose is established. The 
CHMP  agreed  that  the  number  of  subjects  was  large  enough  to  consider  that  these  observed  clinical 
results were sufficient for an established dosing regimen, based on PK/PD extrapolation from adults to 
the target population, to be accepted.  
Regarding  patients  with  PGTCS,  although  the  clinical  efficacy  observed  through  descriptive  data  from 
study  311  is  overall  in  favour  of  perampanel,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  small  number  of  paediatric 
subjects less than 7 years of age (only 4 patients <7 years) made the clinical relevance disputable and 
did not allow to yield any conclusion in the PGTCS indication for this paediatric population under 7 years 
of age. 
This  is  in  line  with  the  Scientific  Advice  “the  similarity  of  therapeutic  response  cannot  be  ensured, 
especially in the youngest children, as the brain is maturing until 7 years of age with different hyper or 
hypoexcitability  thresholds  depending  on  the  area  considered”.  It  was  also  noted  that  the  PDCO 
recommended  that,  from  studies  9  (311)  and  7  (232),  at  least  40  patients  to  be  evaluable  for  primary 
endpoint with PGTCS, including at least 12 patients (30%) in the age group of 4 to <7 years, and 28 patients 
in  the  7  to  <  12  years  of  age  (PIP  EMEA-000467-PIP01-08).  Therefore,  the  number  of  patients  was  not 
enough in PGTCS and in PGTCS of IGE for the 4-7 age range. 
Regarding patients aged 2 to <4 years old, the pilot study 232 included 5 patients aged 2 to <4 years 
old (one patient discontinued early and 4 patients completed study) and the main clinical phase 3 study 
311,  containing  the  majority  of  supportive  efficacy  data,  only  included  children  from  4  years  old.  No 
information regarding the efficacy of perampanel in patients aged 2 to 4 years of age was available from 
the main study and the CHMP therefore agreed that the data were too limited to extend the indication 
in patients below 4 years of age. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Following  the  review  of  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  extension  of  indication  of 
perampanel for the treatment of partial onset seizure (POS), with or without secondary generalized tonic-
clonic seizures (SGTCS) was considered acceptable in children (from 4 to < 12 years of age) with the 
weight-based established dosing regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 46/80 
 
 
 
 
The  extension  of  indication  for  the  treatment  of  primary  generalised  tonic-clonic  (PGTC)  seizures  in 
patients from 7 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) was also considered 
acceptable in children (from 7 to < 12 years of age) with the weight-based established dosing regimen. 
For primary PGTCS in IGE, the data in the paediatric population less than 7 years of age are too limited 
to allow for a solid estimate of the actual efficacy.  
In  paediatric  patients  aged  2  to  <4  years  of  age, no  indication  is  approvable since the  extrapolation, 
based on data from PK/PD was not considered acceptable in this age group and the efficacy data were 
too limited. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of perampanel in pediatric patients with POS and PGTCS is based on data from the 2 
open-label studies 311 and 232.  
Post-marketing use 
All safety data received by the MAH are from worldwide sources. Using the available wholesale data on 
the number of tablets sold and 8 mg as the WHO Defined Daily Dose for FYCOMPA, it is estimated that 
there have been approximately 45 million patient-days of exposure from product launch through 22 Jul 
2018.  
The  post-marketing  safety  profile  of  FYCOMPA  has  been  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  observed 
during the original clinical studies. The most frequently reported spontaneous AEs in patients receiving 
FYCOMPA  are  dizziness,  somnolence,  and  aggression  followed  by  irritability  and  seizure.  A  literature 
review has not identified any new safety concerns.  
Since initial marketing approval, there have been 2 additions to the safety profile. Suicidal ideation and 
suicide  attempt  were  added  as  uncommon  events  to  Section  4.8,  Undesirable  effects  and  Severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
(DRESS)  was  added  in  Section  4.4  Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use  and  in  Section  4.8 
Undesirable effects in Post-marketing use. 
There were no significant changes in the frequency and severity of previously identified adverse reactions 
or important risks.  
Patient exposure 
Extension phase 
Patients  eligible  to  participate  in  Extension  phase  of  Study  311  were  those  who  completed  the  Core 
Study. 
A total of 146 patients completed the Core Study; 136 patients enrolled into Extension phase.

As of the cutoff date of 20 Jul 2018, 132 patients have been treated. Of these, 83 patients are ongoing, 
40 patients have completed, and 9 patients have discontinued: 4 patients discontinued due to an AE, 2 
patients withdrew by choice, and 3 patients discontinued due to inadequate therapeutic effect. 
Extension phase 
A total of 42 patients completed the Core Study; 41 patients entered the Extension Phase and 27 patients 
completed the Study 232 Extension Phase. 
For remind, of the 180 patients, 46 patients (40 patients with POS and 6 patients with PGTCS) were in 
the 4 to <7 year age group and 134 patients (109 patients with POS and 25 patients with PGTCS) were 
in the ≥7 to <12 year age group.

Adverse events 
Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Additional assessments included regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values, 
regular measurements of vital signs, ECGs, and physical and neurological examinations. 
Growth and development were assessed by weight, height, thyroid function tests, and insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1). 
Cognitive  testing  (Aldenkamp-Baker  neuropsychological  assessment  schedule  [ABNAS]),  behavioral 
questionnaires  (Child  Behavior  Checklist  [CBCL]),  and  visuomotor  skills  testing  using  the  Lafayette 
Grooved 
Pegboard Test (LGPT) were performed. 
An assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior using the C-SSRS was performed throughout the study 
for patients aged 6 years and older at the time of consent/assent. Suicidal ideation and behavior was 
monitored in patients less than 6 years at the time of consent/assent based upon clinical impression. 
An EEG was performed over a minimum of 1-hour up to a 2-hour period in an awake and sleep state at 
specified visits (baseline, month 3 and month 12). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
Treatment emergent adverse events are presented and discussed for Study 311 (Core and Extension) 
and Study 232 (Core and Extension).  
Of note, a TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges from the date of first dose of study drug to 28 days 
after last end date of dose in prescribed dose entry, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or 
reemerges  during  treatment,  having  been  present  at  pretreatment  (Baseline)  but  stopped  before 
treatment, or worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is 
continuous. 
Patients  with  2  or  more  adverse  events  in  the  same  system  organ  class  (or  with  the  same  preferred 
term) is counted only once for that system organ class (or preferred term).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The occurrence of TEAEs of special interest was assessed in detail: TEAEs Related to Abuse Potential, 
TEAEs  Related  to  Alertness  and  Cognition,  TEAEs  Related  to  Hostility/Aggression,  TEAEs  Related  to 
Psychosis and Psychotic Disorders, TEAEs Related to Status Epilepticus/Convulsions, TEAEs Related to 
Laboratory Abnormalities, Cardiac and ECG TEAEs, TEAEs Related to Rash, TEAEs related to Falls and 
TEAEs Related to Suicidal Ideation and Behavior. 
TEAEs Related to Abuse Potential: 3 accidental overdose; no patient reported an abuse potential 
related SAE.patients  
TEAEs Related to Alertness and Cognition: the most commonly reported TEAEs related to alertness and 
cognition were somnolence and aggression. Some patients discontinued, some TEAE led to a reduction 
in study drug dose, and some other reported a SAE.

TEAEs Related to Hostility/Aggression:  
The most common events for most subgroups were irritability and aggression.  
There were also cases of agitation, psychomotor hyperactivity, laceration and anger. 
Although  the  sample  size  across  subgroups  was  too  small  for  definitive  conclusions,  differences  in 
incidences of TEAEs were observed. The incidence of TEAEs for patients taking 1 baseline AED was higher 
(45.7%) than that for patients taking 2 or 3 baseline AEDs (26.0% and 28.9%).  
A higher incidence of TEAEs was observed in the non-EIAED subgroup compared to the EIAEDs subgroup 
(33.6% versus 22.4%).  
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  overall  similar  in  patients  taking  AEDs  with  sodium  channel  MOA  versus 
mixed action MOA (25.0% and 20.0%). 
TEAEs Related to Psychosis and Psychotic Disorders (in 12 patients for both studies) 
The most common TEAE in this category related to psychosis/psychotic disorders was 5 bradyphrenia. 
There was also 3 abnormal behaviors. One visual hallucination was considered serious, related to 
study drug and led to study discontinuation.  
TEAEs Related to Status Epilepticus/Convulsions: 
In study 311, overall, 20 (11.1%) patients experienced TEAEs by MedDRA SMQ convulsions, 14 (9.4%) 
patients in the POS cohort including 7 (13.0%) patients in the SGTC subset, and 6 (19.4%) patients in 
the PGTC cohort. 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 57/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  common  TEAEs  in  this  category  were  seizure,  epilepsy,  focal  dyscognitive  seizures, 
generalised tonic-clonic seizure, petit mal epilepsy, and seizure cluster.  
The other TEAEs related to status epilepticus/convulsions were atonic seizures, postictal state, and 
status epilepticus (each reported by 1 [0.6%] patient). 
Three patients discontinued the study due to seizure. Two patients (one in the POS and one in the 
PGTCS  of  IGE  subset,  both  in  ≥7  to  <12  years,  and  without  concomitant  EIAEDs)  reported  a  status 
epilepticus/convulsions-related AE with a PT of seizure, and 1 patient (in the POS, 4 to <7 years, without 
concomitant EIAEDs) reported a status epilepticus/convulsions-related AE with a PT of focal dyscognitive 
seizure  leading  to  drug  withdrawal.  The  patients  with  a  SAE  of  generalised  tonic-clonic  seizure 
discontinued the study.  
In Study 232, 1 patient in Cohort 2 had an event of grand mal convulsion. This event was mild in severity 
and possibly related to study drug; the event led to withdrawal from the study and resolved. 
TEAEs Related to Laboratory Abnormalities 
In  study  311,  no  patient  experienced  TEAEs  related  to  drug-related  hepatic  disorders.  No 
patients discontinued the study or the study drug, or reported a SAE related to this category of TEAE. 
In  study  232,  events  reported  in  more  than  1  patient  included  blood  uric  acid  decreased  and 
thrombocytopenia  in  3  patients  each,  and  metabolic  acidosis,  neutropenia,  and  thyroxine 
decreased in 2 patients each.  
The  events  of  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased,  total  bile  acids  increased,  and  urine  bilirubin 
increased that occurred in 1 patient resulted in discontinuation. These 3 events were non serious, mild 
in intensity, possibly related to study drug, and did not resolve at the time of discontinuation.  
All events were non serious except for an event of hypoglycemia, reported in the Follow-up Period in one 
patient (Cohort 1), which was a SAE. The event was moderate in severity and considered to be possibly 
related to study drug; treatment was given, and the event resolved.

Cardiac and ECG TEAEs  
In study 311, cardiac and ECG TEAEs were reported in 2 patients in the POS cohort. The PTs of lower 
respiratory tract congestion and viral myocarditis were reported. Patient 1501108, a 4 year-old male 
died on Day 68  during  the Core Study having  contracted severe viral myocarditis the same 
day. The event was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study drug.  
A  4-year-old  female  patient  had  lower  respiratory  tract  congestion  (reported  term,  discrete  brachial 
congestion)  during  the  Core  Study.  The  event  was  not  considered  serious,  and  was  assessed  by  the 
investigator as unrelated to study drug. 
One  patient  had  a  TEAE  of  mental  status  changes,  which  was  included  in  the  sub-SMQ  of 
cardiomyopathy. The event was reported as a severe SAE that was not related to study drug; study drug 
was interrupted and the SAE resolved. 
In study 232, the most common TEAE related to cardiac and ECG results was mental status changes (in 
2 patients in Cohort 2), which was the only event that was reported in more than 1 patient overall.  
TEAEs Related to Rash 
In study 311, 26 patients experienced TEAEs related to rash, 22 patients in the POS cohort including 7 
in the SGTC subset and 4 patients in the PGTC cohort. The most common TEAEs related to rash were 
rash, eczema, and urticaria.  
No patients reported a SAE related to rash.  
One patient in the SGTC subset of the POS cohort discontinued the study due to drug eruption.  
In the extension phase, 7 additional patients in the POS cohort including 3 patients in the SGTC subset 
reported a TEAE related to rash.  
In Study 232, one patients had a TEAE of rash papular, which was not a SAE and did not led to treatment 
discontinuation. 
In the extension phase of study 232, TEAE related to rash were reported in 3 patients in Cohort 2 and 1 
patients in Cohort 1. None of these events were serious or resulted in study drug dose modification and 
none of the patient reported a positive skin reaction on the Photosensitivity Questionnaire. 
NB: Photosensitivity Questionnaire, performed as part of safety evaluation in Study 232, showed that 
the  majority  of  patients had  no  notable  reaction,  and  none  of  the  patients  reported  relevant  SAEs  or 
TEAEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  No  safety  concerns  related  to  photosensitivity 
reactions were identified in Study 232. 
TEAEs related to fall  
In study 311, a total of 5 falls occurred, 2 in the POS disease cohort including 1 in the SGTC subset of 
the POS cohort, and 3 in the PGTC cohort. Of the falls in the PGTC cohort, 2 were reported in the PGTCS 
of IGE subset. 
The  5  falls  occurred  during  the  Titration  Phase.  No  patient  discontinued  the  study  or  the  study 
drug, or reported a SAE related to falls. There were no additional falls during the Extension Phase 
In Study 232, 2 patients in Cohort 2 and 1 patient in Cohort 1 experienced falls. All the events were non 
serious and resolved; no action was taken with study drug.

TEAEs Related to Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
In study 311, there were 23 TEAEs related to suicidal ideation and behavior reported by 20 patients. 
All  the  identified  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate.  One  patient  with  a  PT  of  altered  mood  was 
discontinued from study. No patient reported a suicidality-related SAE. 
There was 1 patient (10 years old) in the PGTCS of IGE subset of the PGTC cohort, taking a 10 mg dose 
of perampanel, who reported 2 TEAEs related to suicidality (PT of suicidal ideation; suicidal thinking for 
this patient was also identified through Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) questionnaire). 
These  TEAEs  were  mild  in  severity,  transient,  and  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
investigator. 
There  were  4  additional  TEAEs  reported  by  4  patients  during  the  Extension  Phase:  psychomotor 
hyperactivity (2 reports), initial insomnia, and memory impairment; all events were mild or moderate. 
In Study 232, 1 patient in Cohort 1 had a TEAE related to suicidal ideation and behavior; the event was 
not a SAE, did not result in treatment discontinuation or dose adjustment, was rated mild and not related 
to treatment by the investigator, and resolved without sequelae. 
One patient in Cohort 2 and one patient in Cohort 1 had TEAEs related to suicidal ideation and behavior 
in the Extension Phase.

AESI in the specific age group 2 to 4 years of age from study 232: 
Regarding the AESI in the specific age group 2 to 4 years of age, there were 5 patients aged 2 to <4 
years old in Study 232.  
One patient was treated for a duration of 55 days before discontinuing early from the core study.  
The other 4 patients completed the Core study and entered the Extension Phase.  
Overall, their duration of treatment ranged from 27 to 52 weeks.  
None of these patients were in the PGTCS of IGE subset.  
The AESI were irritability, lethargy, oppositional defiant disorder and aggression.

Discontinuations 
The below tables summarize the TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation of study drug by disease cohort 
in study 311.  
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 62/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  such  TEAEs  were  overall  reported  in  17/180  (9.4%)  patients:  14/149 (9.4%)  patients  in the 
POS cohort, including 2/54 (3.7%) patients in the SGTC subset and 3/31 (9.7%) patients in the PGTC 
cohort.  
The  only  TEAEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  more  than  1  patient  were  balance  disorder  (2 
patients;  1  patient  in  each  cohort),  seizure  (2  patients;  1  patient  in  each  cohort),  aggression  (3 
patients in the POS cohort), and irritability (3 patients; 2 in the POS cohort including 1 patient in the 
SGTC subset, and 1 in the PGTC cohort). 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 4 additional patients during the Extension Phase, 2 
patients in the POS cohort and 2 patients in the PGTC cohort.  
Additional  events  included  fatigue,  ataxia,  generalised  tonic-clonic  seizure,  and  visual 
hallucination reported by 1 patient each. 
Overall,  a  total  of  21  (11.7%)  patients  discontinued  study  drug  due  to  TEAEs:  16  (10.7%) 
patients in the POS cohort including 2 (3.7%) patients in the SGTC subset, and 5 (16.1%) patients in 
the PGTC cohort.  
In the PGTC cohort, 4 (16.7%) patients in the PGTCS of IGE subset and 1 (14.3%) patient in the non-
IGE  subset  had  TEAEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  All  TEAEs  in  this  category  were 
reported by single patients. 
In study 232, Overall, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 3 (6.0%) patients (1 
patient and 2 patients, respectively, in Cohort 2 and Cohort 1). None of the AEs leading to discontinuation 
were reported in more than 1 patient.  
In  the  extension  study  232,  Treatment-emergent  AEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  occurred  in  3 
(15.8%) patients in Cohort 2 and 2 (9.1%) patients in Cohort 1. The only TEAE (PT) that resulted in 
discontinuation of more than 1 patient was aggression (1 patient in each cohort).

Adverse Drug Reactions 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are defined as TEAEs for which there is some basis to believe a causal 
relationship exists between the occurrence of the TEAE and the use of perampanel. 
In the POS submission, identification of potential ADRs was based on an assessment of the full safety 
database for perampanel, including clinical studies in epilepsy and other indications. The methods used 
are described in detail in the summary of clinical safety.  
The following ADRs resulted from this evaluation: dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, irritability, fall, nausea, 
ataxia, weight increased, vertigo, balance disorder, gait disturbance, anxiety, vision blurred, dysarthria, 
back pain, decreased appetite, aggression, diplopia, anger, increased appetite and confusional state. 
For the PGTC seizure submission, the ADR analysis, which included the PGTC seizure data alone and the 
PGTC  seizure  data  pooled with  the  data  from  the  POS  double-blind  studies,  did  not  indicate  any  new 
ADRs from those previously identified in the POS submission. 
For this submission, TEAEs are consistent with TEAEs observed on perampanel treatment in adults and 
adolescents.  
This review does not indicate any new ADRs for perampanel in this pediatric population. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One  (0.7%)  death  was  reported  in  the  POS  cohort.  The  subject  was  a  4  year  old  male  in  the  POS 
cohort  with  concomitant  EIAEDs,  with  a  cause  of  death  (by  PT)  of  viral  myocarditis  determined  by 
autopsy. The TEAE was not considered related to the drug according to the investigator.

Overall, the number of treatment-emergent SAEs was low across the disease cohorts.  
Treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  reported  in  a  total  of  27  (15.0%)  subjects  overall,  with  23  (15.4%) 
subjects in the POS cohort including 13 (24.1%) subjects in the SGTC subset of the POS cohort, and 4 
(12.9%) subjects in the PGTC cohort.  
Thirteen (28.3%) subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs were in 4 to <7 years and 14 (10.4%) were 
in ≥7 to <12 years age cohort in the core study 311. A higher number of subjects had treatment emergent 
SAEs  in  the  without  concomitant  EIAEDs  cohort  (22  [16.7%]  subjects)  compared  to  those  taking 
concomitant EIAEDs (5 [10.4%] subjects). 
All  TESAEs  were  reported  by  1  or  2  subjects  across  all  cohorts,  with  the  exception  of  bronchitis, 
pneumonia, epilepsy and seizure which occurred in 3 (1.7%) subjects. 
An additional 5 subjects reported SAEs during the Extension Phase, 4 subjects in the POS cohort including 
1 subject in the SGTC subset, and 1 subject in the PGTC cohort. As of the data cut-off date of 20 Jul 
2018, a total of 32 (17.8%) subjects experienced SAEs. This represents cumulative data and includes 
SAEs from both Core Study and Extension Phase.  
In  the  PGTC  cohort,  3  subjects  in  the  PGTCS  of  IGE  subset  and  2  subjects  in  the  non-IGE  subset 
experienced SAEs. All SAEs were reported by single subjects. 
Laboratory findings and Other Safety Evaluations 
Laboratory parameters 
There were no clinically important changes in hematology and clinical chemistry mean laboratory results 
values from Baseline to Week 23 for any cohort. Specifically, no clinically relevant changes were observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 66/80 
 
 
 
 
 
for glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. The laboratory results shift analyses revealed that shifts from 
normal to high or low were generally infrequent. 
Twelve subjects had markedly abnormal laboratory hematology results, 2 with markedly abnormal low 
hemoglobin, and 10 with markedly abnormal low neutrophils. 
Seven subjects had markedly abnormal laboratory clinical chemistry results. Five subjects had markedly 
abnormal high gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), including 1 subject who also had markedly abnormal 
high alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1 subject had markedly abnormal high potassium and 1 subject 
had markedly abnormal low sodium and calcium (Core Study 311 Table 32). No subjects had markedly 
abnormal laboratory urinalysis results. 
There were no clinically important changes in mean urinalysis results values from baseline to Week 23 
for any of the 3 disease cohorts. For urinalysis results, 6 (3.8%) subjects had shifts from normal values 
at Baseline to high values at EOT of the Core Study. The urinalysis results shift analysis revealed that 
the patterns of shifts were similar across the disease, age, and concomitant EIAEDs cohorts. 
No  laboratory  abnormalities  led  to  study  discontinuation.  No  laboratory  abnormalities  were  related  to 
SAEs. 
Growth and neurodevelopmental assessments 
Aldenkamp–Baker  Neuropsychological  Assessment  Schedule  (ABNAS)  scores  for  fatigue,  slowing, 
memory,  concentration,  motor-coordination  and  language  were  assessed.  Higher  scores  indicate  a 
worsening of these cognitive parameters. 
Child  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL)  is  a  tool  to  assess  behavioral  and  emotional  problems  in  children  as 
reported by the primary caregiver. 
Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test (LGPT) is a tool to estimate the visuomotor skills. It is a manipulative 
dexterity test that consists of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The subject was 
required to insert 25 pegs for 8 years or older or 10 pegs for under 8 years old for each hand. The task 
was  timed  up  to  a  maximum  of  300  seconds,  and  a  shorter  time  to  completion  indicated  increased 
dexterity. 
There were no clinically significant results at the end of treatment in comparison to baseline as regards 
the three scores. 
Subjects  showed  height  and  weight  gain  proportionate  with  the  expected  growth  of  subjects  in  this 
pediatric population. No meaningful embarrassing effects were observed in height and weight data. 
Mean thyroid and insulin-like growth factor-2 and mean change from Baseline are recorded.  
Mean insulin-like growth factor-2 was lower at baseline and at end of treatment in Cohort 2 (2 to <7 
years) than in Cohort 1 (7 to <12 years). 
Electroencephalogram 
EEG  analysis  included  145  subjects  with  Asleep  EEGs,  and  154  subjects  with  Awake  EEGs  during  the 
Core Study (baseline and Visit 9 [end of Core Study Treatment visit] or Early Discontinuation Visit).  
EEG data collected during the Extension Phase (ie, Visit 12 or Early Discontinuation Extension Phase) 
will be analyzed and presented in a separate report when the Extension is completed. 
Overall, observed primary EEG endpoints (POS and PGTCS) were low at all visits, with only 2 cases of 
POS  being  observed,  and  no  cases  of  PGTCS  were  observed  during  the  baseline  or  Visit  9  EEG 
assessments. Therefore, the primary EEG endpoints of changes in the frequency of POS or PGTCS from 
baseline to Visit 9 were not determinable. 
Results  of  secondary  EEG  endpoints  of  changes  from  baseline  to  Visit  9  in  the  frequency  of  absence 
seizures,  atypical  absence  seizures,  myoclonic  seizures,  seizure  not  able  to  be  classified,  secondarily 
generalized clonic seizures, and epileptiform activity are summarized as follows: 
•  Overall, observed seizures were low for most secondary endpoints, with no cases of myoclonic 
seizures or SGTC seizures reported at any visit. 
•  Six subjects were reported to have absence seizures in either the awake or sleep state. Three 
subjects were reported to have atypical absence seizures in either the awake or sleep state. 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 67/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Thirteen subjects were reported to have not able to be classified seizures in either the awake or 
sleep state. 
•  No statistically significant changes from baseline to Visit 9 were observed in the mean number 
of absence seizures, unclassifiable seizures, or epileptiform activities (prevalence sharp waves, 
prevalence spike-slow waves, and rhythmic runs of spike-waves complexes ≥1 second). 
Overall, there were no statistically significant changes in any of the EEG parameters measured 
following 23 weeks of perampanel treatment, compared to baseline. Similarly, no significant changes 
from baseline in any of the EEG parameters were observed between the ≥4 to <7 years and ≥7 to <12 
years age subgroups and in the inducer and non-inducer subgroups. Therefore, EEG data collected so 
far do not suggest any safety concerns related to EEG abnormalities 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, 160 (88.9%) patients experienced TEAEs. TEAEs occurred in 134 (89.9%) patients in the POS 
cohort including 53 (98.1%) patients in the SGTC subset of the POS cohort, and 26 (83.9%) subjects in 
the PGTC cohort. 
Overall, 14 (7.8%) patients had severe TEAEs.  
Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  reported  in  120  (66.7%)  subjects  overall,  95  (63.8%)  subjects  in  the 
POS  cohort  including  36  (66.7%)  patients  in  the  SGTC  subset  and  25  (80.6%)  patients  in  the  PGTC 
cohort.  
One (0.7%) patient in the POS cohort (a 4-year-old white male) died on Day 68 during the Core Study 
due to viral myocarditis; the death was not considered related to study drug.  
There  were  17  (9.4%)  patients  who  had  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal.  Nearly  half  of  the 
patients (46.7%) with TEAEs leading to study drug adjustment reduced their study drug dose (40.6%). 
Only 1 patient (0.6%) had drug dose increased. 
There were no clinically significant results at the end of treatment in comparison to baseline as regards 
the scores of cognitive testing (ABNAS), child behavioral questionnaires (CBCL), and visuomotor skills 
testing (LGPT). 
Patients  showed  height  and  weight  gain  proportionate  with  the  expected  growth  of  patients  in  this 
pediatric population. No meaningful embarrassing effects were observed in height and weight data. 
Mean thyroid and insulin-like growth factor-2 and mean change from Baseline are recorded.  
Mean insulin-like growth factor-2 was lower at baseline and at end of treatment in Cohort 2 (2 to <7 
years) than in Cohort 1 (7 to <12 years). 
It is noted that, in PGTCS, the safety profile of perampanel in children aged 2 years and <7 years could 
not be assessed properly due to the scarcity of the number of patients studied. 
No  new  adverse  event  was  reported  in  the  submitted  studies.  However,  according  to  the  guideline 
regarding  the  assessment  of  safety,  a  minimum  of 100  children  treated  by  the  study  drug  should  be 
followed for at least one year. Moreover short term and long-term studies should be designed to detect 
possible impact on brain development, learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine functions and puberty. 
In this application, only study 311 (open label, single arm, 136 children over 52 weeks in its extension 
phase) made it possible to meet these specifications. Study 232 (open label 41 children over 52 weeks 
in its extension phase) completed these data. The other studies included children 12 years and over.  
Although the level of recruitment in paediatric studies is a known issue, the data safety collection is a 
major  point,  in  particular  regarding  the  long-term  aspects  (neurodevelopment,  motor  development, 
cognition,  behaviour,  growth,  endocrine  functions  and  puberty).  There  were  some  uncertainties 
regarding the safety profile of perampanel that needed further clarifications and the effect of perampanel 
on neuropsychological aspects in a developing brain and on growth was considered as a concern which 
has to be specifically assessed in the paediatric population on a longer term manner (up to 1 year).  
Consequently, according to the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment 
of  epileptic  disorders,  the  MAH  provided  additional  data  and  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  impact  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 68/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perampanel on brain development, learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine functions and puberty for 
the paediatric population. Adverse events reported in clinical studies and post-marketing data related to 
developmental disorders reported few numbers of cases in children less than 12 years but these effects 
were not identified until now for perampanel. This is a safety concern and it will be specifically monitored 
in  the  future  PSUR  (attention  deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  learning  disability,  cognitive  disorder, 
disturbance in attention, precocious puberty).  
Adverse events reported in children less than 12 years in clinical studies and post-marketing data related 
to behavioral disorders are consistent with the known safety profile of perampanel, highlighting a large 
number of aggression and drowsiness effects in children. 
The literature review did not bring new information on the safety profile of perampanel in children < 12 
years. 
The assessment of cognitive functions, behavior, visuomotor skill development, growth and endocrine 
functions did not seem to show clinically significant impact of perampanel. Puberty/sexual maturation 
and skeletal development neither, however this was assessed on a too small number of children to draw 
any robust conclusion. The MAH is therefore requested to continue to monitor these effects in the ongoing 
paediatric study (Studies 236) and in the future PSUR. 
The relevant statements have been added in the SmPC regarding the higher incidence of some AE and 
some precautions were amended or added. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available safety data, the CHMP concludes that the safety profile in the extended paediatric 
population is acceptable and in line with the known safety profile of perampanel. 
The highlighted safety concerns will continue to be monitored via the subsequent PSURs. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: the PRAC 
considered that the RMP version 4.5 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.5 with the following content:

Overall,  data  presented  by  the  MAH  responded  to  the  concerns  raised  on  the  potential  effect  of 
perampanel  in  patients  under  12  years  of  age  regarding  impact  on  brain  development,  learning, 
intelligence, and growth and endocrine function, with the exception of puberty / sexual maturation and 
skeletal development which could not be evaluated in a sufficient number of these children. 
Adverse events in patients under 12 years of age (reported from clinical studies, post marketing and 
literature  data)  related  to  behavioural  disorders  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
perampanel,  highlighting  a  large  number  of  aggression  and  drowsiness  effects  in  these  patients. 
However, in few (clinical and post-marketing) cases, involving patients under 12 years of age, data about 
adverse  events  linked  to  developmental  disorders  were  reported.  Therefore,  cases  of  attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disability, cognitive disorder, disturbance in attention, precocious 
puberty should be closely monitored in future PSURs. 
The MAH acknowledged that data regarding sexual development in subjects under 12 years of age 
have not been collected. However, it considered that perampanel did not have a clinically meaningful 
effect on puberty or sexual development in this population as Tanner staging assessments were 
conducted for up to 2 years in Study 235 or up to 4 years in Study 307 in subjects aged 12 to <18 
years and. The MAH also believed that whilst the onset of puberty and sexual development is occurring 
at younger ages, especially in females, assessment in the adolescent population is acceptable for 
assessing any possible effects of perampanel on puberty and sexual development. However, the PRAC 
and CHMP are of the view that these criteria should however be thoroughly followed in patients under 
12 years of age, particularly in females, in the ongoing studies (236 and 238) for a sufficient 
timeframe, and in enough patients, to allow relevant conclusions. Also, studies 236 and 238 should 
provide additional data of the long-term effect of perampanel regarding ABNAS, CBCL and LGPT scores 
focusing on cognition, behavior, and dexterity. 
No additional pharmacovigilance activities are deemed necessary.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Epilepsy affect individuals of all ages and are among the most common neurologic disorders. The annual 
cumulative  incidence  of  epilepsy  has  been  reported  to  be  67.77  per  100,000  persons  and  the  point 
prevalence of active epilepsy of 6.38 per 1,000 persons (Fiest, et al., 2017). Although 8 to 10% of the 
population will experience a seizure during their lifetime, only 2 to 3% will go on to develop epilepsy. 
(Gavvala and Schuele, 2016). 
According to the current International Classification of Epileptic Seizures, the classification of epileptic 
seizures  depends  upon  the  age  of  onset  and  clinical  symptoms  and  signs.  Both  etiology  (idiopathic, 
symptomatic  and  cryptogenic)  and  localization  (partial  vs  generalized)  are  considered  crucial 
prerequisites for an adequate evaluation and treatment of epileptic disorders.  
Recently proposed terminology by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has redefined POS 
as “focal seizures” with a variety of seizure subtypes: focal aware seizures, focal impaired awareness 
seizures,  focal  motor  seizures,  focal  non-motor  seizures,  and  focal  to  bilateral  tonic–clonic  seizures 
(Fisher, 2017). The term POS will be used throughout this report.  
Half of the epilepsies begin before the age of 18 and one fourth of these are intractable, having severe 
social  and  cognitive  consequences.  The  majority  of  paediatric  epilepsies  consist  of  age-dependent 
epilepsy  syndromes  whose  manifestations  are  affected  by  ongoing  brain  maturation.  Uncontrolled 
seizures are not only associated with noteworthy lifestyle limitations and social handicaps (e.g., loss of 
driving  privileges,  social  isolation,  difficulty  maintaining  employment),  but  can  result  in  significant 
adverse consequences, including severe trauma, depression, anxiety, and sudden death (Baranowski, 
2018; Sadr, 2018).  
Partial-onset (focal) seizures (POS) account for the majority of diagnosed cases of epilepsy (Hauser WA 
et al., 1996, Kotsopoulos IA et al., 2005). Childhood is the peak age of onset for seizures, particularly 
partial-onset seizures (POS) and Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsies (IGE).  
As opposed to POS, PGTCS have apparent clinical or EEG onset in both hemispheres of the brain, with 
no clear focus or foci. PGTCS are associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and several generalized 
epilepsy syndromes. Onset of PGTCS typically starts in older children, adolescents, and young adults, 
but  does  present  in  children  as  young  as  2  years.  One  critical  EEG  hallmark  of  a  susceptibility  to 
generalized seizures, including PGTCS, are  well-formed generalized spike-wave discharges. These are 
occasionally  seen,  but  are  not  well  developed,  widely  distributed  and  highly  stereotyped  until  2  to  3 
years of age. 
Occurrence  of  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (GTCS)  is  one  of  the  most  important  risk  factors  of 
seizure-related complications and comorbidities in patients with epilepsy. Their prevention is therefore 
an important aspect of therapeutic management both in idiopathic generalized epilepsies and in focal 
epilepsies.  Because  of  the  complications  related  to  GTCS,  including  increased  risk  of  SUDEP,  their 
prevention is an important aspect of therapeutic management both in idiopathic generalized epilepsies 
and in partial epilepsies.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the main treatment option. Over the past 20 years, several AEDs have 
been developed with the objective of improving efficacy, tolerability, and ease of use when compared 
with classic currently-used AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and 
benzodiazepines.  
Approximately 60 % of newly diagnosed patients are seizure-free with monotherapy and an additional 
10-20%  with  polytherapy.  It  follows  that  about  30%  of  patients  are  not  satisfactorily  controlled.  In 
addition, many patients suffer from significant adverse effects. 
It has been shown that the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) varies across epilepsy syndromes, with 
some  AEDs  efficacious  against  focal  seizures  with  secondary  GTCS  (sGTCS)  but  aggravating  primary 
GTCS (pGTCS). In patients with SGTCS, all AEDs approved in the treatment of focal epilepsies might be 
used. 
The AED efficacious against focal seizures are mostly granted in adults and adolescents. Only some of 
the AED are indicated as adjunctive therapy in children 2 years of age and older (clonazepam, clobazam, 
lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam) or in children 4 years of age and older (lacosamide). It is to be 
noted that the enzyme-inducing AED like carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital may aggravate 
primary GTCS. 
In patients with PGTCS, evidence-based data support the preferential use of valproic acid, lamotrigine, 
levetiracetam and topiramate.  
Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment option for children from 2 
to  12  years  of  age  in  the  POS  as  well  as  in  the  PGTCS  treatment.  This  need  is  increased  with  the 
restrictions in the use of valproate (VPA), especially in girls, as the treatment of choice for PGTCS of 
IGE. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For the current submission, the MAH proposes to widen the approved indications to children aged 2 years 
and older through extrapolation of adult and adolescent efficacy and pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
derived from the open-label Phase 3 study E2007-G000-311 (Study 311) in patients aged 4 to <12 years 
with inadequately controlled POS or PGTC seizures and from the Phase 2 study E2007-G000-232 (Study 
232), which analyzed PK data from patients with epilepsy aged 2 to <12 years. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The clinical efficacy observed through descriptive data from study 311 seems overall at a rate comparable 
to that seen in adults and adolescents >12 years of age for the treatment of partial onset seizure (POS) 
and  secondary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (SGTCS).  The  efficacy  results  could  be  considered 
clinically meaningful for this cohort in both age cohorts (4 to <7 years and 7 to<12 years).  
For the POS cohort, 
The  median  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  as  compared  to  baseline  for  total  POS 
seizures was -40.1% (total, n = 148), -42.7% (age 4 to <7 years, n = 108) and -40.1% (age 7 to <12 
years, n = 40). The results are considered clinically meaningful for the POS cohort as the number of 
patients  was  rather  large;  as  an  indirect  comparison,  this  median  percent  change  in  adults  and 
adolescents >12 years of age was -35% for 8 mg as well as for 12 mg daily. 
There were 69 (46.6%) subjects with a responder rate of 50% or greater of whom 18 (45.0%) subjects 
aged 4 to <7 years, and 51 (47.2%) subjects aged 7 to <12 years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 74/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As an indirect comparison, in adults and adolescents >12 years of age, the responder rate in the POS 
cohort is around 35% when the 3 phase III studies are considered.  
The overall seizure free status was achieved in 17 (11.5%) subjects. Seizure free status was achieved 
by 3 (7.5%) subjects aged 4 to <7 years and 14 (13.0%) subjects aged 7 to <12 years. 
For the SGTC subset of the POS cohort, the same trend as for the POS is observed. 
Overall, the clinical effect as regards to the POS or SGTCS seems comparable to that observed in adults. 
When considering the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic 
disorders (CHMP/EWP/566/98 Rev.2/Corr), the effect of perampanel on partial seizures, with or without 
secondary generalization, is extrapolated from adults to children > 4 years of age, after an agreement 
regarding the weight-based dose has been established.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For the POS cohort and SGTC subset of the POS cohort, 
The observed favourable effects are weakened by methodological limitations (open-labelled, no placebo 
group) which per se do not allow to draw any robust conclusion. Therefore, the clinical efficacy results 
remain only descriptive hence no formal statistics were performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 75/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the PGTC cohort, 
The  median  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  as  compared  to  baseline  for  the  PGTC 
cohort was overall -69.2% (total; n=22), -56.5% (age 4 to <7 years; n=3) and -81.9% (age 7 to <12 
years;  n=19).  There  were  14  (63.6%)  subjects  with  a  responder  rate  of  50%  or  greater  of  whom  2 
(66.7%)  subjects  aged  4  to  <7  years,  and  12  (63.2%)  subjects  aged  7  to  <12  years.  These  results 
should however be considered very cautiously because of the small number of patients, all the more in 
the 4 to 7 age cohort (n = 3 patients, 2 IGE and 1 non-IGE) for which no conclusion could be drawn. 
The overall seizure free status was achieved in 12 (54.5%) subjects. Seizure free status was achieved 
by 2 (66.70%) subjects aged 4 to <7 years and 10 (52.6%) subjects aged 7 to <12 years.  
Although  the  clinical  efficacy  through  descriptive  data  from  study  311  is  overall  observed  among 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) or non-IGE subjects in both age cohorts (4 to <7 years and 7 to<12 
years), the clinical relevance in the PGTC cohort is disputable and does not allow to yield any conclusion 
in the 4 to <7 years group considering the small number of subjects.  
PK/PD assessment: 
As a result of the assessment of the submitted studies, the true PK/PD relationship in children was not 
established, since PK/PD data from both adult/adolescent and the paediatric population were pooled. In 
addition the MAH initially claimed that a weight-based dose regimen in the paediatric population (4 to < 
12years) was still not required because the weight had no effect on clearance. This was not endorsed. 
In fact, results from one simulation study clearly showed that with a fixed dose regimen, exposure tended 
to  increase  more  than  adult  exposure,  because  age  (and  weight)  decrease  suggested  that  a  weight-
based dosing regimen should be studied. 
The  uncertainties  regarding  the  dose  in  the  various  age  groups  were  further  solved  through  the 
determination of a weight-based dose for three weight categories : <20kg, 20 to < 30 kg and > 30 kg. 
According to the scientific advice 2017, the following concerns were issued.  
-  Regarding  safety,  this  aspect  should  specifically  be  assessed  in  children  as  it  cannot  be 
extrapolated  from  the  safety  observed  in  adults;  as  PGTCS  appears  within  more  complex 
syndromes associating different seizure types, the effect of perampanel on these other seizure 
types should be assessed within the safety assessment, at least to rule out a detrimental effect 
(or quantify it to integrate it into the overall benefit/risk assessment). The effect of perampanel 
on neuropsychological aspects in a developing brain and on growth should also be specifically 
assessed in the paediatric population. 
The clinical efficacy data from the study 232 in patients aged 2 to 12 years were overall similar to those 
collected in study 311. However, the number of patients was very small and therefore the results of this 
study  only  brought  few  information  regarding  the  safety  profile.  In  addition,  from  a  pharmacokinetic 
aspect,  PK  data  from  Study  232  were  interpreted  with  caution  before  the  critical  issues  with  the 
developed bioanalytical method were solved. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No new adverse event was reported in the submitted studies. However, there were some uncertainties 
regarding the submitted safety data and also the lack of long-term data which are of major importance, 
especially in the paediatric population.  
Indeed,  according  to  the  guideline,  regarding  the  assessment  of  safety,  a  minimum  of  100  children 
treated by the study drug should be followed for at least one year. Moreover short term and long-term 
studies  should  be  designed  to  detect  possible  impact  on  brain  development,  learning,  intelligence, 
growth, endocrine functions and puberty.  
Firstly,  the  submitted  studies  were  not  designed  to  collect  enough  long-term  safety  information; 
secondly,  there  were  some  uncertainties  that  needed  clarifications  regarding  the  safety  profile  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 76/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perampanel.  Although  the  level of  recruitment in paediatric  studies  is  a  known  issue,  the  data  safety 
collection was a major point, in particular regarding the long-term aspects (neurodevelopment, motor 
development,  cognition,  behaviour,  growth,  endocrine  functions  and  puberty).  These  aspects  were 
lacking and the MAH was requested to further provide data related to puberty / sexual maturation and 
skeletal development, which could not be evaluated in a sufficient number of children. The applicant was 
therefore requested to continue to monitor the effects in the ongoing paediatric study (Studies 236) and 
in the future PSUR. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In PGTCS, the safety profile of perampanel in children aged 2 years and <7 years could not be assessed 
properly due to the low number of patients studied. 
The data presented by the MAH responded to the concerns about the potential effect of perampanel in 
children under 12 years of age regarding impact on brain development, learning, intelligence, and growth 
and  endocrine  function,  with the exception  of  puberty  /  sexual  maturation  and  skeletal  development, 
which could not be evaluated in a sufficient number of children. Consequently, the MAH was requested 
to  continue  to  monitor  the  puberty  /  sexual  maturation  and  skeletal  development  in  the  ongoing 
paediatric study (Studies 236) and in the future PSUR. 
The relevant statements have been added in the SmPC regarding the higher incidence of some AE and 
some precautions were amended or added. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizure  (POS)  and  secondary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures 
(SGTCS), the clinical efficacy observed through descriptive data from study 311 is overall reassuring. 
The efficacy results could be considered clinically meaningful for both age cohorts (4 to <7 years and 7 
to<12 years).  
When considering the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic 
disorders (CHMP/EWP/566/98 Rev.2/Corr), the effect of perampanel on partial seizures, with or without 
secondary generalization, could be extrapolated from adults to children > 4 years of age, provided the 
dose is established. Based on that statement, the efficacy between adults and children > 4 years of age 
in the treatment of POS and SGTCS seems comparable and acceptable from a clinical point of view. 
It  could  be  considered  that  the  number  of  subjects  is  large  enough  to  consider  that  these  observed 
clinical results are sufficient for an established weight-based dose based on PK/PD extrapolation from 
adults  to  the  target  population.  However,  the  favourable  effect  for  this  cohort  is  weakened  by 
methodological  limitations  (open-labelled,  no  placebo  group)  which  per  se  do  not  allow  to  draw  any 
robust conclusion. Therefore, the clinical efficacy results remain only descriptive and no formal statistics 
were performed. 
For  the  treatment  of  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (PGTCS),  although  the  clinical  efficacy 
observed  through  descriptive  data  from  study  311  is  overall  in  favour  of  perampanel,  the  clinical 
relevance in the PGTC cohort is disputable, all the more in the paediatrics <7 years of age and does not 
allow to yield any conclusion on the efficacy of perampanel in PGTCS considering the small number of 
subjects. The occurrence of other types of seizures such as absences and myoclonic seizures, were not 
completely described and reassuring and a warning is added in section 4.4 of the SmPC accordingly.  
For the non-IGE subjects (n=3 overall in study 311), the very small number of patients do not allow to 
draw any conclusion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 77/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  safety  profile  of  perampanel  in  children  aged  2  years  and  <4  years  cannot  be  considered  as 
sufficiently established, due to the very low number of patients, and the fact that extrapolation from 2 
years was not considered acceptable. 
According to the draft guideline of clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epilepsy 
disorders, it is stated: “Generally, from the safety point of view, preferably 100 children should be treated 
by the study drug and followed for at least one year. Moreover, short term and long-term studies should 
be  designed  to  detect  possible  impact  in  the  neurodevelopment,  motor  development,  cognition, 
behaviour, growth, endocrine functions and puberty... Some of these studies may require continuation 
in  the  post  marketing  period  [see  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  children 
(CPMP/EWP/462/95)].  Prospective  disease-based  registries  (per  paediatric  epilepsy  syndromes  or 
symptoms) may be helpful and are encouraged”.  
After assessment of the submitted data, some safety aspects were considered reassuring while other 
need further safety data. Consequently, the MAH was requested to continue to monitor the puberty / 
sexual maturation and skeletal development in the ongoing paediatric study (Studies 236) and in the 
future PSUR. 
To  conclude,  based  on  the  submitted  clinical  data,  the  extension  of  indication  of  perampanel  for  the 
treatment  of  partial  onset  seizure  (POS),  with  or  without  secondary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures 
(SGTCS) in children from 4 years old and older was endorsed and depends on the weight-based dosing 
regimen.  
The  extension  of  indication  of  perampanel  for  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (PGTCS)  in 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in children from 7 years of age and older is also endorsed and also 
depends on the same weight-based dosing regimen as for POS.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Perampanel tablets (2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg) are approved in the European Union (EU) 
for  the  adjunctive  treatment  of  partial-onset  seizures  (POS)  with  or  without  SG  seizures  in  adult  and 
adolescent patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older (23 Jul 2012); and as adjunctive therapy for 
the  treatment  of  PGTCS  in  adult  and  adolescent  patients  aged  12  years  and  older  with  IGE  (22  Jun 
2015).  
A 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension was also approved in the EU for the same indications (19 Sep 2016). 
In the United States of America (USA), perampanel tablets (2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 
mg) and perampanel oral suspension 0.5 mg/mL are approved for monotherapy of POS with or without 
SG seizures in adult and adolescent patients, and as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of PGTCS in 
patients  with  epilepsy  12  years  of  age  and  older.  In  September  2018,  the  US  Food  and  Drug 
Administration  (FDA)  approved  extension  of  the  indication  of  perampanel  for  monotherapy  and 
adjunctive  use  in  pediatric  patients  4  years  and  older  for  the  treatment  of  POS  with  or  without  SG 
seizures. The approval includes both tablet and oral suspension formulations. 
For  the  current  submission,  the  MAH  proposed  to  widen  the  approved  indications  to  children  aged  2 
years  and  older  through  extrapolation  of  adult  and  adolescent  efficacy  and  pediatric  pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  data  derived  from  the  open-label  Phase  3  study  311  in  subjects  aged  4  to  <12  years  with 
inadequately controlled POS or PGTC seizures and from the Phase 2 study 232, which analyzed PK data 
from subjects aged 2 to <12 years with a diagnosis of epilepsy with any type of seizure according to the 
International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures. 
In paediatric patients aged 2 to <4 years of age, no indication is approvable since the extrapolation from 
PK/PD is not acceptable in this age group. Moreover, the efficacy data are too sparse and the safety data 
are lacking. 
Based on the assessment of the available clinical data, the extension of indication of perampanel for the 
treatment  of  partial  onset  seizure  (POS),  with  or  without  secondary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures 
Assessment report  
EMA/695418/2020  
Page 78/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(SGTCS) is acceptable in children (from 4 to < 12 years of age) as the administered dose is adjusted 
according to a body-weight basis as detailed in the proposed SmPC.  
For  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (PGTCS)  in  idiopathic  generalized  epilepsy  (IGE)  in 
paediatrics < 7 years of age, the studied group is too small to estimate the actual efficacy. Moreover, 
the  safety  profile  in  this  small  group  could  not  be  extrapolated  in  this  condition.  The  extension  of 
indication  of  perampanel  for  the  treatment  of  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (PGTCS)  in 
idiopathic  generalized  epilepsy  (IGE)  is  acceptable  in  children  (from  7  to  <  12  years  of  age)  as  the 
administered dose is also adjusted according to a body-weight basis as detailed in the proposed SmPC 
(same dose of for POS).  
Some  safety  aspects  were  considered  reassuring  while  other  need  further  safety  data.  Consequently, 
the MAH was requested to continue to monitor the puberty / sexual maturation and skeletal development 
in  the  ongoing  paediatric  study  (Studies  236)  and  in  the  future  PSUR  (attention  deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, learning disability, cognitive disorder, disturbance in attention, precocious puberty). Relevant 
statements  have  been  added  in  the  SmPC  regarding  the  higher  incidence  of  some  AE  and  some 
precautions were amended or added. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fycompa in paediatric patients from 4 to 11 years of age for the adjunctive 
treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation and from 7 to 11 years of 
age for the adjunctive treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures with idiopathic 
generalised epilepsy is positive.

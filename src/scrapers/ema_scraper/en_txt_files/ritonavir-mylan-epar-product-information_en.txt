daily dosing in ART experienced patients. 
Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in ART-naïve patients. 
Children and adolescents 
Ritonavir is recommended for children 2 years of age and older. For further dose recommendations, 
refer to the product information of other Protease Inhibitors approved for co-administration with 
ritonavir. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
As ritonavir is primarily metabolised by the liver, ritonavir may be appropriate for use with caution as 
a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency depending on the specific protease 
inhibitor with which it is co-administered. However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is 
negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment. 
For specific dosing information in patients with renal impairment, refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) of the co-administered protease inhibitor. 
Hepatic impairment 
Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver 
disease, (see section 4.3). In the absence of pharmacokinetic studies in patients with stable severe 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C) without decompensation, caution should be exercised when 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer as increased levels of the co-administered PI may 
occur. Specific recommendations for use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with 
hepatic impairment are dependent on the protease inhibitor with which it is co-administered. The SPC 
of the co-administered PI should be reviewed for specific dosing information in this patient 
population. 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent 
Adults 
The recommended dose of ritonavir is 600 mg (6 tablets) twice daily (total of 1,200 mg per day) by 
mouth. 
Gradually increasing the dose of ritonavir when initiating therapy may help to improve tolerance. 
Treatment should be initiated at 300 mg (3 tablets) twice daily for a period of three days and increased 
by 100 mg (1 tablet) twice daily increments up to 600 mg twice daily over a period of no longer than 
14 days. Patients should not remain on 300 mg twice daily for more than 3 days. 
Paediatric population (2 years of age and above) 
The recommended dose of ritonavir in children is 350 mg/m2 by mouth twice daily and should not 
exceed 600 mg twice daily. Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg/m2 and increased at 2 to 3 day 
intervals by 50 mg/m2 twice daily.  
Other pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this population. 
For older children it may be feasible to substitute tablets for the maintenance dose of other 
pharmaceutical forms.

Ritonavir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age due to lack of data on safety and 
efficacy. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic data indicated that no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 
5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Currently, there are no data specific to this patient population and therefore specific dose 
recommendations cannot be made. The renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible therefore; a decrease 
in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment. Because ritonavir is 
highly protein bound it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Ritonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that no 
dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Ritonavir must not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ritonavir in children aged below 2 years has not been established. Currently 
available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Method of administration 
Ritonavir Mylan film-coated tablets are administered orally and should be ingested with food (see 
section 5.2). 
Ritonavir Mylan film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs, consult the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor for contraindications. 
Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients 
with decompensated liver disease. 
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A- and 
CYP2D6- mediated biotransformations. The following medicinal products are contraindicated when 
used with ritonavir and unless otherwise noted, the contraindication is based on the potential for 
ritonavir to inhibit metabolism of the co-administered medicinal product, resulting in increased 
exposure to the co-administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse events. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The enzyme-modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent. For some products, 
contraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. rifabutin and voriconazole):

Rationale 
Concomitant use of ritonavir 
(400 mg twice daily and more) 
and voriconazole is 
contraindicated due to a 
reduction in voriconazole 
plasma concentrations and 
possible loss of effect (see 
section 4.5).

life-threatening reactions in 
patients with renal and/or 
hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Concomitant use of ritonavir 
(500 mg twice daily) dosed as 
an antiretroviral agent and 
rifabutin due to an increase of 
rifabutin serum concentrations 
and risk of adverse reactions 
including uveitis (see section 
4.4). 
Recommendations regarding 
use of ritonavir dosed as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer with 
rifabutin are noted in section 
4.5. 
Increased plasma 
concentrations of lurasidone 
which may increase the 
potential for serious and/or

ergot toxicity, including 
vasospasm and ischaemia. 
Increased plasma 
concentrations of cisapride. 
Thereby, increasing the risk of 
serious arrhythmias from this 
agent. 
Increased plasma 
concentrations of lovastatin 
and simvastatin; thereby, 
increasing the risk of myopathy 
including rhabdomyolysis (see 
section 4.5). 
Increased plasma 
concentrations of lomitapide 
(see section 4.5). 
Increased plasma 
concentrations of avanafil (see 
sections 4.4. and 4.5). 
Contraindicated when used for 
the treatment of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) 
only. 
Increased plasma

Thereby, increasing the 
potential for 
sildenafil-associated adverse 
events (which include 
hypotension and syncope). See 
section 4.4 and section 4.5 for 
co-administration of sildenafil 
in patients with erectile 
dysfunction. 
Increased plasma

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Patients receiving ritonavir or any other 
antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of 
HIV-1 infection. 
When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other PIs, full details on the warnings and 
precautions relevant to that particular PI should be considered, therefore the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for the particular PI must be consulted. 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
Patients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption 
Extra monitoring is recommended when diarrhoea occurs. The relatively high frequency of diarrhoea 
during treatment with ritonavir may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased 
compliance) of ritonavir or other concurrent medicinal products. Serious persistent vomiting and/or 
diarrhoea associated with ritonavir use might also compromise renal function. It is advisable to 
monitor renal function in patients with renal function impairment. 
Haemophilia 
There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and 
haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some 
patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with 
protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal 
relationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. 
Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or 
abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of 
pancreatitis should occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and 
ritonavir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8). 
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. 
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and 
treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Liver disease 
Ritonavir should not be given to patients with decompensated liver disease (see section 4.2). Patients 
with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased 
risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy 
for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be 
monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
Renal disease 
Since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not 
expected in patients with renal impairment (see also section 4.2). 
Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy 
(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) 
in clinical practice (see section 4.8). 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience 
joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
PR interval prolongation 
Ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some 
healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with 
underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients 
receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have 
been reported in patients receiving ritonavir. Ritonavir should be used with caution in such patients 
(see section 5.1). 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent 
The following warnings and precautions should be considered when ritonavir is used as an 
antiretroviral agent. When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the 100 mg and 200 mg 
level it cannot be assumed that the following warnings and precautions will also apply. When ritonavir 
is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, full details on the warnings and precautions relevant to that 
particular PI must be considered, therefore the Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.4, for 
the particular PI must be consulted to determine if the information below is applicable. 
PDE5 inhibitors 
Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction in patients receiving ritonavir. Co-administration of ritonavir with these medicinal 
products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse 
reactions such as hypotension and prolonged erection (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of avanafil or 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of sildenafil with 
ritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3). 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for 
metabolism, thus concomitant use of ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due 
to an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Caution must also be exercised and 
reduced doses should be considered if ritonavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is 
metabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A. While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, 
an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration. The 
mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition. When used 
with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest doses of 
atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered. The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is 
not dependent of CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir. If treatment with an HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Colchicine 
Life-threatening and fatal interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Digoxin 
Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since 
co-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels. The increased 
digoxin levels may lessen over time (see section 4.5). 
In patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be 
reduced to one-half of the patients’ normal dose and patients need to be followed more closely than 
usual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin. 
In patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced 
more gradually than usual. Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during this 
period, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and digoxin 
level findings. 
Ethinylestradiol 
Barrier or other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered when administering 
ritonavir at therapeutic or low doses as ritonavir is likely to reduce the effect and change the uterine 
bleeding profile when co-administered with estradiol-containing contraceptives. 
Glucocorticoids 
Concomitant use of ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 
is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5). 
Trazodone 
Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients using trazodone. Trazodone is 
a CYP3A4 substrate and co-administration of ritonavir is expected to increase trazodone levels. 
Adverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed in single dose 
interaction studies in healthy volunteers (see section 4.5). 
Rivaroxaban 
It is not recommended to use ritonavir in patients receiving rivaroxaban, due to the risk of increased 
bleeding (see section 4.5). 
Riociguat 
The concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in riociguat exposure 
(see section 4.5). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vorapaxar 
The concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in vorapaxar exposure 
(see section 4.5). 
Bedaquiline 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could 
potentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions. Therefore, combination of 
bedaquiline with ritonavir should be avoided. However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, 
co-administration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution. More frequent 
electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and 
refer to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics). 
Delamanid 
Co-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (ritonavir) may increase exposure to 
delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation. Therefore, if 
co-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring 
throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the 
delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics). 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
The interaction profiles of HIV-protease inhibitors, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are 
dependent on the specific co-administered protease inhibitor. 
For a description of the mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile 
of the PIs, see section 4.5. Please also review the Summary of Product Characteristics for the 
particular boosted PI. 
Saquinavir 
Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used. Higher doses of ritonavir have 
been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions. Co-administration of 
saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse reactions, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver 
disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease. 
Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe 
hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicinal products are 
given together (see section 4.5). 
Tipranavir 
Co-administration of tipranavir with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical 
hepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities. Extra vigilance is warranted in patients 
with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of 
hepatotoxicity. 
Doses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy 
profile of the combination. 
Fosamprenavir 
Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not 
been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the 
combination and therefore is not recommended. 
Atazanavir 
Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been 
clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir 
(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with 
ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted. Refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for atazanavir for further details. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 87.75 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 4.4% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
The maximum daily dose of this product is equivalent to 53% of the WHO recommended maximum 
daily intake for sodium. 
Ritonavir is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for those on a 
low sodium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent 
Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation 
with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6. Co-administration of ritonavir and medicinal 
products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other 
medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. For selected 
medicinal products (e.g. alprazolam) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over 
time. Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter. The 
inhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease 
over time (e.g. digoxin and fexofenadine-see table “Ritonavir effects on non-antiretroviral medicinal 
products” below). Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products 
metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal 
products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect. 
Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor. 
Medicinal products that affect ritonavir levels 
Serum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing St 
John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). This is due to the induction of medicinal product metabolising 
enzymes by St John’s wort. Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort must not be used in 
combination with ritonavir. If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, St John’s wort should be

The dose of ritonavir may need adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after 
cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3). 
Serum levels of ritonavir may be affected by select co-administered medicinal products (e.g. 
delavirdine, efavirenz, phenytoin and rifampicin). These interactions are noted in the medicinal 
product interaction tables below. 
Medicinal products that are affected by the use of ritonavir

when the two are dosed together. When ritonavir is used in combination 
with another protease inhibitor and buprenorphine, the SPC of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor should be reviewed for specific 
dosing information. 
Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma 
concentrations of norpethidine and propoxyphene and is therefore 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral 
agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the

Co-administration of encorafenib and ritonavir should be avoided.  If 
the benefit is considered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be 
used, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
Co-administration of fostamatinib with ritonavir may increase 
fostamatinib metabolite R406 exposure resulting in dose-related 
adverse events such as hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, hypertension, or 
diarrhoea. Refer to the fostamatinib SmPC for dose reduction 
recommendations if such events occur. 
Serum concentrations of ibrutinib may be increased due to CYP3A 
inhibition by ritonavir, resulting in increased risk for toxicity including 
risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Co-administration of ibrutinib and 
ritonavir should be avoided. If the benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risk and ritonavir must be used, reduce the ibrutinib dose to 140 mg and 
monitor patient closely for toxicity.

An increase in the incidence in trazodone-related adverse reactions was 
noted when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral

with ritonavir, the combination should be used with caution, initiating 
trazodone at the lowest dose and monitoring for clinical response and 
tolerability. 
Concentrations of colchicine are expected to increase when 
co-administered with ritonavir. 
Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in 
patients treated with colchicine and ritonavir (CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inhibition) in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). Refer to the colchicine prescribing information. 
Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma 
concentrations of astemizole and terfenadine and is therefore 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Ritonavir may modify P-glycoprotein mediated fexofenadine efflux 
when dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
resulting in increased concentrations of fexofenadine. Increased 
fexofenadine levels may lessen over time as induction develops. 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral 
agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma

Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of

contraindicated (see section 4.3). The reduction of the rifabutin dose 
to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs when 
co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. The 
Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease 
inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate 
treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients. 
Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data 
indicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is 
co-administered with rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of 
rifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may have no 
clinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-dose ritonavir 
therapy. 
The effect of ritonavir on rifampicin is not known.

No interaction study is available with ritonavir only. In an interaction 
study of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple dose lopinavir/ritonavir, 
the AUC of bedaquiline was increased by 22%. This increase is likely 
due to ritonavir and a more pronounced effect may be observed during 
prolonged co-administration. Due to the risk of bedaquiline related

outweighs the risk, co-administration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must 
be done with caution. More frequent electrocardiogram monitoring and 
monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.4 and refer 
to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics).

Due to the large therapeutic window of clarithromycin no dose 
reduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal function. 
Clarithromycin doses greater than 1 g per day should not be 
co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer. For patients with renal impairment, a 
clarithromycin dose reduction should be considered: for patients with 
creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 
50%, for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min the dose 
should be reduced by 75%. 
Delamanid 
Erythromycin, itraconazole 
No interaction study is available with ritonavir only. In a healthy 
volunteer drug interaction study of delamanid 100 mg twice daily and 
lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days, the exposure of 
the delamanid metabolite DM-6705 was 30% increased. Due to the risk 
of QTc prolongation associated with DM-6705, if co-administration of 
delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG 
monitoring throughout the full delamanid treatment period is 
recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the delamanid Summary of 
Product Characteristics) 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral 
agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the 
plasma concentrations of erythromycin and itraconazole. Careful 
monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when 
erythromycin or itraconazole is used concomitantly administered with 
ritonavir.

Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma

contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 
and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of haloperidol, 
risperidone and thioridazine. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and 
adverse effects is recommended when these medicinal products are 
concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir. 
Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of lurasidone are 
expected to increase. The concomitant administration with lurasidone is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of quetiapine are 
expected to increase. Concomitant administration of ritonavir and 
quetiapine is contraindicated as it may increase quetiapine-related 
toxicity (see section 4.3). 
Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result a pronounced increase in the 
plasma concentrations of salmeterol is expected. Therefore concomitant 
use is not recommended. 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral 
agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the 
plasma concentrations of calcium channel antagonists. Careful 
monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when 
these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
Co-administration of bosentan and ritonavir may increase steady state 
bosentan maximum concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve 
(AUC). 
Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp 
inhibition by ritonavir. The co-administration of riociguat with ritonavir 
is not recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to riociguat SmPC). 
Ergot derivatives 
Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine,

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A 
metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have 
markedly increased plasma concentrations when co-administered with 
ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic 
enhancer. Since increased concentrations of lovastatin and simvastatin 
may predispose patients to myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, the 
combination of these medicinal products with ritonavir is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). Atorvastatin is less dependent on 
CYP3A for metabolism. While rosuvastatin elimination is not 
dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been 
reported with ritonavir co-administration. The mechanism of this 
interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition. 
When used with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an 
antiretroviral agent, the lowest possible doses of atorvastatin or 
rosuvastatin should be administered. The metabolism of pravastatin and 
fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A, and interactions are not 
expected with ritonavir. If treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended.

Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma 
concentrations of clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam and 
is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Midazolam is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. Co-administration 
with ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this 
benzodiazepine. No medicinal product interaction study has been 
performed for the co-administration of ritonavir with benzodiazepines. 
Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of 
midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is 
given orally. Therefore, ritonavir should not be co-administered with 
orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution 
should be used with co-administration of ritonavir and parenteral 
midazolam. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with 
other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3 – 4 fold increase in 
midazolam plasma levels. If ritonavir is co-administered with 
parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) 
or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and 
appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression 
and/or prolonged sedation. Dose adjustment for midazolam should be 
considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is 
administered.

antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, before induction 
of alprazolam metabolism develops. 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral

Bupropion is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6. Concurrent 
administration of bupropion with repeated doses of ritonavir is 
expected to decrease bupropion levels. These effects are thought to 
represent induction of bupropion metabolism. However, because 
ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the 
recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. In contrast to 
long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant 
interaction with bupropion after short-term administration of low doses 
of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reductions in 
bupropion concentrations may have onset several days after initiation 
of ritonavir co-administration. 
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and 
adrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 
86% in the above study) have been reported in patients receiving 
ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; similar 
effects could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised by 
CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone. Consequently, 
concomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent 
or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these glucocorticoids is not 
recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the 
risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose 
reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close 
monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, 
which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, 
in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction 
may be required over a longer period. 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral 
agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma

In addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of 
increased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal 
products should be considered. 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor. 
Proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists 
Proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. omeprazole or ranitidine) may reduce 
concentrations for co-administered protease inhibitors. For specific information regarding the impact 
of co-administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor. Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted protease 
inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir), concurrent administration of omeprazole or ranitidine does 
not significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of 
exposure (about 6 - 18%). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount (6100 live births) of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy; of 
these, 2800 live births were exposed during the first trimester. These data largely refer to exposures 
where ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower 
doses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other PIs. These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth 
defects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems. Animal data 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ritonavir can be used during pregnancy if 
clinically needed.   
Ritonavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives (OCs). Therefore, an alternative, effective and 
safe method of contraception should be used during treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. 
There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on 
milk production.  Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) 
developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed 
infant, women living with HIV should not breast-feed their infants if they are receiving ritonavir. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of ritonavir on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness is a 
known undesirable effect that should be taken into account when driving or using machinery.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and 
jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other 
antiretrovirals. 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 
4.4). 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months 
after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed 
hypertriglyceridemia. In some cases fatalities have been observed. Patients with advanced HIV disease 
may be at risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis (see section 4.4). 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). 
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric populations 
The safety profile of ritonavir in children 2 years of age and older is similar to that seen in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Human experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited. One patient in clinical studies took 
ritonavir 1,500 mg/day for two days and reported paraesthesia, which resolved after the dose was 
decreased. A case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported. 
The signs of toxicity observed in animals (mice and rats) included decreased activity, ataxia, dyspnoea 
and tremors. 
Management 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir. Treatment of overdose with ritonavir should 
consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient. Due to the solubility characteristics and possibility of transintestinal 
elimination, it is proposed that management of overdose could entail gastric lavage and administration 
of activated charcoal. Since ritonavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein 
bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the medicinal product.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors ATC code: J05AE03. 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
Pharmacokinetic enhancement by ritonavir is based on ritonavir’s activity as a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A- mediated metabolism. The degree of enhancement is related to the metabolic pathway of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor and the impact of the co-administered protease inhibitor on the 
metabolism of ritonavir. Maximal inhibition of metabolism of the co-administered protease inhibitor is 
generally achieved with ritonavir doses of 100 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily, and is dependent on 
the co-administered protease inhibitor. For additional information on the effect of ritonavir on 
co-administered protease inhibitor metabolism, see section 4.5 and refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the particular co-administered PIs. 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent 
Ritonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases. 
Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein 
precursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to 
initiate new rounds of infection. Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little 
inhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases. 
Ritonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study 
with clinical endpoints. However, due to ritonavir’s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical 
practice (see section 4.2). 
Effects on the electrocardiogram 
QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) 
controlled crossover study in 45 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3. The 
maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo was 5.5 (7.6) for 
400 mg twice daily ritonavir. The Day 3 ritonavir exposure was approximately 1.5 fold higher than 
that observed with the 600 mg twice daily dose at steady state. No subject experienced an increase in 
QTcF of ≥ 60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant 
threshold of 500 msec. 
Modest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study 
on Day 3. The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 24.0 msec in the 
12 hour interval post dose. Maximum PR interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart 
block was observed (see section 4.4). 
Resistance 
Ritonavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and isolated from patients treated with 
therapeutic doses of ritonavir. 
Reduction in the antiretroviral activity of ritonavir is primarily associated with the protease mutations 
V82A/F/T/S and I84V. Accumulation of other mutations in the protease gene (including at positions 
20, 33, 36, 46, 54, 71, and 90) can also contribute to ritonavir resistance. In general, as mutations 
associated with ritonavir resistance accumulate, susceptibility to select other PIs may decrease due to 
cross-resistance. The Summary of Product Characteristics of other protease inhibitors or official 
continuous updates should be consulted for specific information regarding protease mutations 
associated with reduced response to these agents.

Clinical pharmacodynamic data 
The effects of ritonavir (alone or combined with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers of 
disease activity such as CD4 cell count and viral RNA were evaluated in several studies involving 
HIV-1 infected patients. The following studies are the most important. 
Adult use 
A controlled study completed in 1996 with ritonavir as add-on therapy in HIV-1 infected patients 
extensively pre-treated with nucleoside analogues and baseline CD4 cell counts ≤ 100 cells/μl showed 
a reduction in mortality and AIDS defining events. The mean average change from baseline over 
16 weeks for HIV RNA levels was -0.79 log10 (maximum mean decrease: 1.29 log10) in the ritonavir 
group versus -0.01 log10 in the control group. The most frequently used nucleosides in this study were 
zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine and zalcitabine. 
In a study completed in 1996 recruiting less advanced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4 200-500 cells/μl) 
without previous antiretroviral therapy, ritonavir in combination with zidovudine or alone reduced 
viral load in plasma and increased CD4 count. The mean average change from baseline over 48 weeks 
for HIV RNA levels was -0.88 log10 in the ritonavir group versus -0.66 log10 in the ritonavir + 
zidovudine group versus -0.42 log10 in the zidovudine group. 
The continuation of ritonavir therapy should be evaluated by viral load because of the possibility of 
the emergence of resistance as described under section 4.1. 
Paediatric use 
In an open label study completed in 1998 in HIV infected, clinically stable children there was a 
significant difference (p = 0.03) in the detectable RNA levels in favour of a triple regimen (ritonavir, 
zidovudine and lamivudine) following 48 weeks treatment. 
In a study completed in 2003, 50 HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor and lamivudine naïve children age 
4 weeks to 2 years received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 every 12 hours co-administered with 
zidovudine 160 mg/m2 every 8 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. In intent to treat 
analyses, 72% and 36% of patients achieved reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of ≤ 400 copies/ml at 
Week 16 and 104, respectively. Response was similar in both dosing regimens and across patient age. 
In a study completed in 2000, 76 HIV-1 infected children aged 6 months to 12 years who were 
protease inhibitor naive and naive to lamivudine and/or stavudine received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 
every 12 hours co-administered with lamivudine and stavudine. In intent to treat analyses, 50% and 
57% of patients in the 350 and 450 mg/m2 dose groups, respectively, achieved reduction in plasma 
HIV-1 RNA to ≤ 400 copies/ml at Week 48. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
There is no parenteral formulation of ritonavir, therefore the extent of absorption and absolute 
bioavailability have not been determined. The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir during multiple dose 
regimens were studied in non-fasting HIV-infected adult volunteers. Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir 
accumulation is slightly less than predicted from a single dose due to a time and dose-related increase 
in apparent clearance (Cl/F). Trough concentrations of ritonavir decrease over time, possibly due to 
enzyme induction, but appeared to stabilise by the end of 2 weeks. The time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax) remained constant at approximately 4 hours with increasing dose. Renal clearance 
averaged less than 0.1 l/h and was relatively constant throughout the dose range. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters observed with various dosing schemes of ritonavir alone are shown 
in the table below. Plasma concentrations of ritonavir after administration of a single 100 mg dose 
tablet are similar to the 100 mg soft gelatin capsule under fed conditions.

Effects of food on oral absorption 
Food slightly decreases the bioavailability of the ritonavir tablet. Administration of a single 100 mg 
dose of ritonavir tablet with a moderate fat meal (857 kcal, 31% calories from fat) or a high fat meal 
(907 kcal, 52% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 20-23% in ritonavir AUC 
and Cmax. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) of ritonavir is approximately 20 – 40 l after a single 
600 mg dose. The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98 - 99% and is 
constant over the concentration range of 1.0 – 100 μg/ml. Ritonavir binds to both human alpha 1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) with comparable affinities. 
Tissue distribution studies with 14C-labelled ritonavir in rats showed the liver, adrenals, pancreas, 
kidneys and thyroid to have the highest concentrations of ritonavir. Tissue to plasma ratios of 
approximately 1 measured in rat lymph nodes suggests that ritonavir distributes into lymphatic tissues. 
Ritonavir penetrates minimally into the brain. 
Biotransformation 
Ritonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily 
by the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform. Animal studies as well 
as in vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicated that ritonavir primarily underwent 
oxidative metabolism. Four ritonavir metabolites have been identified in man. The isopropylthiazole 
oxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent 
compound. However, the AUC of the M-2 metabolite was approximately 3% of the AUC of parent 
compound. 
Low doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease 
inhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence 
the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
Human studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was 
primarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, 
part of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir. In these studies renal elimination was not found 
to be a major route of elimination of ritonavir. This was consistent with the observations in animal 
studies. 
Special populations 
No clinically significant differences in AUC or Cmax were noted between males and females. Ritonavir 
pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically significantly associated with body weight or lean 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body mass. Ritonavir plasma exposures in patients 50 – 70 years of age when dosed 100 mg in 
combination with lopinavir or at higher doses in the absence of other protease inhibitors is similar to 
that observed in younger adults. 
Patients with impaired liver function 
After multiple dosing of ritonavir to healthy volunteers (500 mg twice daily) and subjects with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B, 400 mg twice daily) exposure to ritonavir 
after dose normalisation was not significantly different between the two groups. 
Patients with impaired renal function 
Ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. 
However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, no changes in the total body clearance are 
expected in patients with renal impairment. 
Paediatric patients 
Ritonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children above 
2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 250 mg/m2 twice daily to 400 mg/m2 twice daily. 
Ritonavir concentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients were 
comparable to those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg (approximately 330 mg/m2) twice daily. 
Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in 
paediatric patients above 2 years of age than in adult subjects. 
Ritonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children less than 
2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 350 to 450 mg/m2 twice daily. Ritonavir concentrations in 
this study were highly variable and somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg 
(approximately 330 mg/m2) twice daily. Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) 
declined with age with median values of 9.0 L/h/m2 in children less than 3 months of age, 7.8 L/h/m2 
in children between 3 and 6 months of age and 4.4 L/h/m2 in children between 6 and 24 months of age. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid 
gland and kidney. Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were 
accompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes. Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
and retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have 
not been seen in dogs. Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary to 
phospholipidosis. However, clinical studies revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced ocular 
changes in humans. All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir. 
Clinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function 
tests. Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted 
in rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease. Furthermore, no clinically 
significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical studies. 
Developmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and 
ossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a 
maternally toxic dose. Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and 
decreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dose. 
Ritonavir was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays 
including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse 
lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human 
lymphocytes. 
Long term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential 
specific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ritonavir Mylan is and what it is used for 
Ritonavir Mylan contains the active substance ritonavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor used to 
control HIV infection. Ritonavir is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines 
(antiretrovirals) to control your HIV infection. Your doctor will discuss with you the best combination 
of medicines for you. 
Ritonavir Mylan is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected 
with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child takes Ritonavir Mylan

* 
Your doctor may decide that you can take rifabutin and/or voriconazole with a booster (lower 
dose) of ritonavir but a full dose of ritonavir must not be taken together with these two 
medicines. 
If you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about switching to a different 
medicine while you are taking Ritonavir Mylan. 
Also read the list of medicines under ‘Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan’ for use with certain other 
medicines which require special care. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Ritonavir Mylan. 
Important information 
- 
If Ritonavir Mylan is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important 
that you also carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines. There may 
be additional information in those leaflets about situations when ritonavir should be avoided. If 
you have any further questions about Ritonavir Mylan (ritonavir) or the other medicines 
prescribed, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. 
People taking ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection or AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor 
while taking Ritonavir Mylan. 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor if you have/had: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
A history of liver disease. 
Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at 
a greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the 
liver. Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly. 
Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia 
who are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors). The reason for this is not known. 
You may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any 
bleeding. 
Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension 
and prolonged erection. 
Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes 
mellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors. 
Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines 
(such as protease inhibitors). 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor if you experience: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the 
medicines you are taking work. 
Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of 
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Some patients taking ritonavir can develop serious 
problems with their pancreas. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you. 
Symptoms of infection - inform your doctor immediately. Some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections 
they have had in the past even if they didn’t know they had had them. It is believed that this 
happens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these 
infections. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. 
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty 
moving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone 
(osteonecrosis). Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this 
disease. 
Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy 
including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions these muscle 
disorders have been serious. (See section 4 Possible side effects) 
Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat. Some patients taking 
ritonavir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Tell your doctor if you have 
a heart defect or conduction defect. 
If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can. 
Children and adolescents 
Ritonavir Mylan is not recommended in children below 2 years of age. 
Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. There are some medicines you cannot 
take at all with ritonavir. These are listed earlier in section 2, under ‘Do not take Ritonavir Mylan’. 
There are some other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below. 
The following warnings apply when Ritonavir Mylan is taken as a full dose. However, these warnings 
may also apply when Ritonavir Mylan is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be 
taken. 
- 
- 
Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction). 
The dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid 
hypotension and prolonged erection. You must not take Ritonavir Mylan with sildenafil if you 
suffer from pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know 
before you or your child takes Ritonavir Mylan). Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil 
for pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Colchicine (for gout) as ritonavir may raise the blood levels of this medicine. You must not take 
ritonavir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take 
Ritonavir Mylan’ above). 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Digoxin (heart medicine). Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you 
while you are taking digoxin and Ritonavir Mylan in order to avoid heart problems. 
Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol as ritonavir may reduce the effectiveness 
of these medicines. It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of 
contraception is used instead. You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking 
this type of hormonal contraceptive with ritonavir. 
Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as ritonavir may raise the blood levels of 
these medicines. Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with 
ritonavir (see also ‘Do not take Ritonavir Mylan’ above). 
Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as ritonavir 
may raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing’s syndrome 
(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol. Your doctor 
may wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely. 
Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood 
pressure and fainting can occur when taken with ritonavir. 
Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver 
damage can occur when taken with ritonavir. 
Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as ritonavir may increase the 
blood levels of this medicine. 
There are medicines that may not mix with ritonavir because their effects could increase or decrease 
when taken together. In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or 
monitor you regularly. This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, 
including those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention 
these:

56 
 
 
There are some medicines you cannot take at all with ritonavir. These are listed earlier in section 2, 
under ‘Do not take Ritonavir Mylan’. 
Taking Ritonavir Mylan with food and drink 
Ritonavir Mylan tablets should be taken with food. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, it is very 
important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
There is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active substance in Ritonavir 
Mylan) during pregnancy. In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months 
of pregnancy at a lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors. Ritonavir did not appear to 
increase the chance of developing birth defects compared to the general population. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. 
Driving and using machines 
Ritonavir Mylan can cause dizziness. If you are affected do not drive or use machinery. 
Ritonavir Mylan contains sodium 
This medicine contains 87.75 mg of sodium in each tablet. This is equivalent to 4.4% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
if you need five or more tablets daily for a prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to 
follow a low salt (sodium) diet. 
3.  How to take Ritonavir Mylan 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. Take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food. 
It is important that Ritonavir Mylan tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. 
Recommended doses of Ritonavir Mylan are: 
• 
if Ritonavir Mylan is used to boost the effects of certain other anti-HIV medicines the typical 
dose for adults is 1 to 2 tablets once or twice daily. For more detailed dose recommendations, 
including those for children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Ritonavir Mylan 
is given in combination with. 
if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 tablets in the morning 
and 3 tablets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose 
of 6 tablets twice daily (totalling 1,200 mg per day). Children (2 - 12 years of age) will start 
with a dose smaller than this and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size. 
• 
Your doctor will advise you on the dose to be taken. 
Other forms of this medicine may be more appropriate for children who have difficulty swallowing 
tablets. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ritonavir Mylan should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you 
feel. If a side effect is preventing you from taking Ritonavir Mylan as directed, tell your doctor 
straight away. During episodes of diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed. 
Always keep enough Ritonavir Mylan on hand so you don't run out. When you travel or need to stay in 
the hospital, make sure you have enough Ritonavir Mylan to last until you can get a new supply. 
If you take more Ritonavir Mylan than you should 
Numbness, tingling, or a “pins and needles” sensation may occur if you take too much ritonavir. If you 
realise you have taken more Ritonavir Mylan than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the 
Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away. 
If you forget to take Ritonavir Mylan 
If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible. If it is nearly time for the next dose, just 
take that one. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Ritonavir Mylan 
Even if you feel better, do not stop taking Ritonavir Mylan without talking to your doctor. Taking 
Ritonavir Mylan as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the 
medicines. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Also, the 
side effects of ritonavir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other 
medicines. 
So it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with 
these other medicines.

osteonecrosis. See also section 2 What you need to know before you or your child takes Ritonavir 
Mylan.  
In patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking 
this treatment or another protease inhibitor. Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from 
your doctor. 
Abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), and rarely jaundice, have been 
reported in patients taking ritonavir. Some people had other illnesses or were taking other medicines. 
People with liver disease or hepatitis may have worsening of liver disease. 
There have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly when taking medicines 
to lower cholesterol in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors and 
nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). 
In the event of unexplained or continual muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps, stop taking the 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicine, contact your doctor as soon as possible or go to the Accident and Emergency Department of 
your nearest hospital. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms that suggest an allergic 
reaction after taking Ritonavir Mylan such as rash, hives or breathing difficulties. 
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, 
contact your doctor, pharmacist, Accident and Emergency department or if it is urgent get 
immediate medical help. 
Reporting of side effects

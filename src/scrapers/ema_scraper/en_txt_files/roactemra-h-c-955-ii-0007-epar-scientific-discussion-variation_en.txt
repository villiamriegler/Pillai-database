Scientific discussion  
1.1.  Introduction 
Tocilizumab  (TCZ),  the  active  substance  of  RoActemra,  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX),  is 
indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in  adult  patients 
who  have  either  responded  inadequately  to,  or  who  were  intolerant  to,  previous  therapy  with  one  or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. 
In  these  patients,  RoActemra  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of  intolerance  to  MTX  or  where 
continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
The recommended posology is 8 mg/kg body weight, but no lower than 480 mg, given once every four 
weeks. 
This application seeks to extend the current indication to include a statement that RoActemra inhibits 
the progression of joint damage and improves physical function.  
Study WA17823 is a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel group Phase III study in which adult 
RA patients were initially randomised to receive placebo, tocilizumab 4 mg/kg or tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. 
All  patients  received  concomitant  MTX.  This  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  reduction  in  signs  and 
symptoms  of  RA  after  24  weeks,  prevention  of  joint  damage  at  52  weeks  evaluated  by  radiographs 
(with confirmation at 104 weeks), physical function at 52 weeks (with confirmation at 104 weeks), and 
long-term safety.  
During  year  1,  the  study  was  conducted  as  a  randomised,  double-blind,  and  parallel  group  design. 
After  week  52,  patients  were  switched  to  open-label  treatment  with  tocilizumab  8  mg/kg.  However, 
patients who were responding well after one year of treatment, as indicated by a 70% improvement in 
joint  count,  could  continue  on  their  double-blind  assignment  rather  than  switching  to  open-label 
treatment  with  tocilizumab  8  mg/kg.  Patients  who  chose  to  continue  their  double-blind  treatment  at 
week 52 could still switch to open-label treatment between weeks 52 and 104 (year 2) if they were no 
longer  receiving  the  same  level  of  efficacy  (a  24-week  interim  analysis  of  data  on  the  reduction  of 
signs  and  symptoms  of  RA  was  included  in  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA) 
submitted in November 2007 and approved in January 2009).  
This  variation  includes  the  2-year  Clinical  Study  Report  for  WA17823;  these  data  demonstrate  that 
tocilizumab  in  combination  with  MTX  reduced  the  progression  of  joint  damage  and  improved  physical 
function over 2 years. The reduction in clinical signs and symptoms of RA, demonstrated in the initial 
MAA, was maintained/improved over 2 years of treatment. Further supportive long-term efficacy data 
are provided from ongoing extension studies (WA18695/WA18696) that enrolled patients from the core 
Phase  III  trials  submitted  with  the  initial  MAA  (WA17822,  WA17824,  WA18062,  WA18063)  plus 
WP18633 (a Phase I drug-drug interaction study). 
Long-term  safety  data  are  provided  from  Study  WA17823,  as  well  as  from  the  ongoing  extension 
studies (WA18695/WA18696). The overall safety profile observed in patients with prolonged exposure 
to tocilizumab is consistent with what has been previously characterised. 
Due to the ongoing review of the safety as part of this variation application, some changes have been 
made  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC),  including  changes  to  the  posology  and 
additional information in special warnings and precautions for use.  
As part of this ongoing evaluation of the safety, plus further elucidation of the mechanism of action of 
tocilizumab,  non-clinical  studies  on  placental  transfer  and  milk  excretion  and  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicology have been included in this variation application.

Joint  destruction  and  physical  functioning  have  been  discussed  to  some  extent  in  the  initial  PIP 
application and are considered to be covered by the existing EMA Decision P129/2009 on “Autoimmune 
arthritis” as per the PIP procedure EMEA-000309-PIP01-08-M01.  
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects  
The  MAH  has  provided  new  pharmacological,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  information  obtained 
with tocilizumab and its murine analogue, MR16-1, a rat anti-mouse IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal 
antibody (IgG1). In order to provide a thorough non-clinical risk evaluation of any interference with IL-
6R  signalling  and  the  full  reproductive  cycle,  fertility  and  pre-/postnatal  development  studies  were 
conducted in the mouse using MR16-1. Further, a combined fertility and pre-/ postnatal development 
study  was  conducted  in  IL-6  knockout  mice.  The  pre-/postnatal  development  studies  included  a 
determination of T-cell subtypes and functional assessment of the immune system. 
These  additional  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  the  good  laboratory 
practice (GLP) standards. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Determination of MR16-1 Concentration and Anti-MR16-1 Antibody Titer in Mouse Plasma in “Placental 
Transfer Study of MR16-1 in Mice (Study No. PBC036-072):” 
A single intravenous administration of MR16-1 (50 mg/kg) was given to pregnant mice on days 11, 15 
and 17 of gestation, and MR16-1 concentrations in plasma of pregnant animals and foetuses on day 18 
of  gestation  were  measured  by  ELISA.  In  addition,  anti-MR16-1  antibodies  in  plasma  of  pregnant 
animals and foetuses dosed on day 11 of gestation were measured by ELISA. 
MR16-1: Milk excretion study of MR16-1 in mice 
A  single  intravenous  administration  of  MR16-1  (50  mg/kg)  was  given  to  mice  on  days  5  to  6  after 
parturition, and MR16-1 concentrations in plasma and milk were measured before dosing, 1, 3 and 7 
days post dose by ELISA. In addition, anti-MR16-1 antibody in plasma and milk were measured before 
dosing and 7 days post dose by ELISA. 
Toxicology 
Studies were conducted on the effects of MR16-1 on male and female fertility, and pre- and postnatal 
development in the mouse, including determination of immune function. 
In addition, a combined fertility and pre-/postnatal development study was conducted in IL-6 knockout 
mice  cross-paired  with  wild-type  mice.  This  study  also  included  determination  of  immune  function 
parameters in the F0 and F1 generation. As the studies conducted with MR16-1 were associated with 
deaths of at most 24% of repeatedly treated animals, in particular at the low dose, starting after a few 
administrations,  some  further  investigations  were  carried  out  to  clarify  the  cause  of  these  deaths. 
Analysis  revealed  that  repeated  treatment  with  MR16-1  evokes  antibodies  in  plasma,  i.e.  plasma 
samples  judged  as  positive  for  anti-MR16-1  antibodies,  were  also  positive  for  extravasation  in  the 
cutaneous  anaphylaxis  test.  It  was  concluded  that  this  antibody  development  likely  has  led  to  fatal 
immunogenic reactions of at most ~24% of the recipient animals. 
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
MR16-1: A Study for Effects of MR16-1 on Fertility and Early Embryonic Development to Implantation 
by Intravenous Administration in Male Mice (study 1033493) 
A rat IgG1 antibody directed against mouse  IL-6R resulted in the death of 10 out of 57 males in the 
15-mg/kg  group  starting  after  several  administrations  and  recorded  mostly  20-70  minutes  after 
administration.  These  animals  very  likely  died  due  to  a  decreased  blood  flow,  i.e.  pulmonary  stasis

resulting  from  an  immunoreaction  to  MR16-1.  No  adverse  effects  were  observed  in  terms  of  body 
weight, 
food  consumption,  gross  pathological 
findings, 
testis  or  epididymis  weights,  or 
histopathological findings of the testis or epididymis in any treatment group.  
MR16-1: A Study for Effects of MR16-1 on Fertility and Early Embryonic Development to Implantation 
by Intravenous Administration in Female Mice (study 1033494) 
Rat IgG1 antibody directed against mouse IL-6R resulted in the death of 12  out of 60 females in the 
15-mg/kg group and 1 out of 60 female in the 50-mg/kg group starting after a few administrations and 
recorded mostly 30-60 minutes after administration. These animals very likely died due to a decreased 
blood  flow,  i.e.  pulmonary  stasis  resulting  from  an  immunoreaction  to  MR16-1.  No  adverse  effects 
were  observed  in  terms  of  body  weight,  food  consumption,  estrous  cycles,  or  gross  pathological 
findings in any treatment group.  
MR16-1:  A  Study  for  Effects  of  MR16-1  on  Pre-  and  Postnatal  Development,  Including  Maternal 
Function, by Intravenous Administration in Mice (study 103492) 
Rat IgG1 antibody directed against mouse IL-6R resulted in the death of 11 out of 66 dams in the 15-
mg/kg  group  only  starting  after  a  few  administrations  and  recorded  mostly  within  2  hours  after 
administration.  These  animals  very  likely  died  due  to  a  decreased  blood  flow,  i.e.  pulmonary  stasis 
resulting from an immunoreaction to MR16-1. Additionally, abortion in 3 dams and total F1 litter loss in 
3  dams,  and  suppression  of  body  weight  gain  and  decreases  in  food  consumption  in  dams  and 
decreased pup viability by Day 4 after birth, which were also likely due to an immunoreaction to MR16-
1, were observed in the 15-mg/kg group only. In the 50-mg/kg group, no dams died, and no adverse 
effects  were  observed  in  terms  of  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  food  consumption,  delivery,  nursing 
behaviour, or gross pathological findings. 
Combined Fertility and Prenatal/Postnatal Reproduction Toxicity Study in B6.129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J (IL-6 
knockout) and C57 Mice, Including Behavioural/Functional Evaluations (study 1029892) 
The study was designed to detect effects on the estrous cycle, tubal transport, implantation, gestation, 
parturition, lactation and maternal behaviour in female mice, and permit detection of functional effects 
(e.g.,  effects  on  libido  or  epididymal  sperm  maturation)  not  detected  by  histological  examinations  of 
male mouse reproductive organs, and to provide data on immunocompetence and immunophenotyping 
from cross pairing of male and female B6.129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J (IL-6 knockout) and C57 Mice. Because 
manifestations of effects induced during this period may be delayed in the offspring, observations were 
continued through sexual maturity of F1 generation mice. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects  
Several  studies  were  designed  in  order  to  investigate  the  effects  of  intravenous  treatment  with 
MR16-1, a rat IgG1 antibody directed against mouse IL-6 receptor, on pre- and postnatal development 
including  assessment  of  immune  function.  There  is  published  evidence  that  the  pharmacological 
properties  of  MR16-1  with  tocilizumab  are  similar.  Furthermore  the  specificity  of  the  rat  MR16-1 
antibody for the mouse IL-6 receptor was demonstrated.  
The  data  show  that  MR16-1  was  transferred  across  the  placenta  from  dams  to  foetuses  in  pregnant 
mice  and  that  MR16-1  was  excreted  in  milk  after  intravenous  administration  of  MR16-1  to  lactating 
mice.  
Studies  on  male  and  female  fertility  in  the  mouse  revealed  that  repeat  dosing  with  MR16-1  was 
associated with deaths of at most 24% of treated animals. It can be agreed that these deaths might be 
attributed to high immunogenic potential of the rat antibody in mice. From the other data (peripheral 
blood  phenotypes,  primary  IgM  or  IgG  antibody  responses,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  food 
consumption,  gross  necropsy  etc.)  there  was  no  clear  significant  evidence  for  toxicologically  relevant 
impairment of reproductive and developmental functions including the developing immune system. As 
tocilizumab is of very low  immunogenicity in humans, these immunological reactions of mice towards 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 4/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
repeated  treatment  with  the  rat  IgG1  antibody  MR16-1  can  be  considered  as  not  relevant  for  the 
human situation. 
The MAH provided a thorough critical reassessment of the non-clinical data regarding the observations 
made in the combined fertility and pre/postnatal development study with IL-6 knock out mice such as 
female mice (F0) sacrificed or dying prior to scheduled euthanasia., decreased pup survival on days 2 
to  4  postpartum,  slower  learning  ability  of  IL-6  knock-out  mice  versus  C57  mice  and  a  critical 
assessment of the findings in relationship to immunological parameters determined in the study. 
Regarding  the  number  of  female  mice  sacrificed  or  dying  prior  to  scheduled  euthanasia,  still  no 
explanation for the deaths has been provided but the MAH clarified that there were no such findings in 
the  pre-postnatal  study  with  the  IL6R  surrogate  antibody  MR16-1  and  that  the  use  of  RoActemra  in 
humans in late stages of pregnancy is indicated only under favourable risk-benefit conditions. 
Regarding the decreased pub survival, differences between the in-bred strains and the out bred strain 
were  identified  as  cause.  Differences  between  knockout  and  wild-type  mouse  strains  in  other 
reproductive parameters were published in literature.  
There  were  some  differences  in  the  F0  IL-6  knock  out  animals  versus  their  wild  type  counterparts 
described  in  the  study  report.  Upon  a  closer  look  at  the  individual  data  as  part  of  the  immunology 
report only the cell-mediated immunity appears to be decreased in male F0 animals. 
Finally  fertility  and  pre/postnatal  studies  with  MR16-1  in  mice  did  not  show  any  impairment  of 
pregnancy or parturition, or harm to offspring during the pre- and postnatal development phase with 
treatment  from  implantation  until  day  21  after  delivery  (weaning).  There  was  no  evidence  for  any 
functional  impairment  of  the  development  and  behaviour,  learning  ability,  immune  competence  and 
fertility of the offspring. 
3.3 Clinical aspects 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
3.3.1 Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  
This  application  includes  the  report  of  routine  pharmacokinetic  sampling  throughout  the  two  year 
period in study WA17823. A total of 841 patients provided PK samples as per the protocol. The mean 
(range) age of patients was 53 (19-85) years and the mean (range)  weight was 71.6 (34.5-148) kg. 
There were more females (83%) than males (17%) in this PK population. 
Two further pre-dose levels of tocilizumab (Ctrough) have been measured in year 2 (time points: week 
80 and 104). The mean predose concentrations at weeks 80 and 104 are summarized in Table 1. For 
comparison, the mean predose TCZ concentrations at weeks 24 and 52 (year 1) are also summarized 
in  Table  1.  The  mean  steady-state  predose  concentration  of  TCZ  for  those  receiving  4  mg/kg  was 
0.567 ± 1.80 µg/mL at week 80 and 1.09 ± 2.77 µg/mL at week 104.  The mean steady state predose 
concentration of TCZ for those receiving 8 mg/kg was 18.5 ± 13.2 µg/mL at week 80 and 19.9 ± 17.0 
µg/mL at week 104. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 5/37
 
 
   
 
 
Table 1 
The concentrations of TCZ were sustained from week 24 in year 1 to week 104 (Table 1), which is at 
the end of year 2. 
Dosing by body weight / PK/PD relationship  
TCZ concentration versus response 
The use of TCZ 8 mg/kg has been demonstrated as an effective regimen both as monotherapy and in 
combination with MTX/other DMARDs. The influence of body weight on systemic clearance supports the 
dosing of TCZ on a milligram per kilogram basis in the majority of patients. 
From  the  population  PK  analysis  included  in  the  original  submission  it  is  known  that  TCZ-treated 
patients  with  high  body  weight  have  higher  AUC,  Cmax,  and  Cmin  values  compared  to  patients  with 
low body weight, who have relatively lower AUC, Cmax, and Cmin (Table 2). 
Table 2 
A  sigmoid  Emax  model  was  developed  to  describe  the  relationship  between  TCZ  concentrations  and 
reduction  in  DAS28  observed  from  the  clinical  data  in  the  6-month  controlled  studies  (Figure  1).  The 
EC50  (the  concentration  at  which  a  DAS28  reduction  was  achieved  that  is  50%  of  the  maximal 
response)  was  approximately  3.72  µg/ml.  For  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  dose,  the  majority  of  patients  were 
above the EC50. When TCZ serum concentrations were greater than 19.4 µg/ml (the mean Ctrough at 
steady state, following TCZ 8 mg/kg q4w, see Table 2), TCZ had already achieved 84% of its maximal 
effect on the decrease in DAS28. The dose response curve flattens with increasing TCZ concentrations; 
thus  only  minor  gains  in  efficacy  will  be  achieved  for  each  incremental  increase  in  TCZ  concentration 
(Table 2 and Figure 1). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 6/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  TCZ  effect  approached  the  plateau  of  the  response  curve  at  8  mg/kg  dose 
(Cmin  to  Cmax)  and  that  further  increase  of  exposure  would  result  in  minimal  reduction  in  DAS 
formation rate.  
Response in different body weight groups 
The impact of weight on clinical response (ACR20) was explored using 6 month data from the pooled 
DMARD-inadequate responder population in the original submission. The greatest response was seen in 
patients with a body weight < 60 kg. Overall, the response to TCZ 8 mg/kg + DMARD was shown to 
decrease slightly with increasing body weight; ACR20 response rates were 65%, 58%, and 50% in the 
< 60 kg, 60–100 kg, and > 100 kg subgroups, respectively. 
Long-term follow-up was performed with the All Exposure population (intent to treat (ITT) population) 
from  the  open-label  extension  studies.  In  this  analysis,  ACR  response  rates  by  body  weight  were 
evaluated in four subgroups of patients by baseline weight (< 60 kg, 60 to < 80 kg, 80 to 100 kg, and 
> 100 kg). Results confirmed previous findings, which indicated that the best responses were observed 
in  patients  who  were  <  60  kg  and  that,  as  patient  weight  increased,  the  response  to  TCZ  therapy 
slightly decreased. 
After  48  weeks  of  treatment,  ACR50  response  rates  in  the  <  60  kg  subgroup  were  50%,  42%,  and 
47%  for  patients  from  the  WA17824,  WA18062,  and  Pooled  groups,  respectively.  In  contrast,  mean 
ACR50 responses for patients in the > 100 kg subgroup were 35%, 33%, and 39%. After 96 weeks of 
treatment, patients < 60 kg continued to show greater improvement in ACR50 response (59%, 55%, 
and 57% for the respective groups), compared with responses in the > 100 kg group (39%, 41%, and 
44%). 
Patients  weighing  less  than  60  kg  had  the  highest  efficacy  in  both  the  6-month  studies  and  in  long-
term  follow-up  in  the  All  Exposure  population.  Thus,  the  overall  exposure  to  TCZ  in  this  group  is 
sufficient,  indicating  that  a  minimum  dose  of  480  mg  is  not  required.  The  SmPC  has  been  updated 
accordingly. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 7/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
To  further  illustrate  the  relationship  between  exposure  and  efficacy  in  patients  with  a  body  weight  > 
100  kg,  model-based  simulations  were  performed.  The  simulations  compared  two  dosing  regimens: 
TCZ  8  mg/kg  versus  a  capped  dose  of  800  mg  in  patients  with  body  weight  >  100  kg.  The  results 
indicated that the proportion of patients > 100 kg predicted to have DAS28 remission following TCZ 8 
mg/kg  (39.8%)  was  comparable  to  that  for  the  dose  capped  at  800  mg  (38.5%).  Similarly,  the 
proportion  of  patients  predicted  to  have  good  EULAR  response  following  TCZ  8  mg/kg  (50.5%),  was 
comparable to that for the dose capped at 800 mg (48.8%). 
The difference in the response to a TCZ dose of 8 mg/kg compared with a total dose of TCZ 800 mg 
thus appears to be small, with no major clinical impact on efficacy. These results confirm that capping 
the dose at 800 mg for patients with body weight > 100 kg will not limit the efficacy in this population. 
These analyses by body weight showed that, although exposure increased as patient weight increased, 
the response to TCZ therapy did not increase. These finding can be explained by the Emax relationship 
between  TCZ  concentration  and  efficacy  parameters (see  Figure  1).  Simulated  response  data  confirm 
that  administration  of  the  maximum  total  dose  of  800  mg  results  in  response  levels  that  are 
comparable  to  those  obtained  with  the  dose  of  8  mg/kg.  Specifically  these  data  show  that  patients 
weighing more than 100 kg, who would receive a total dose exceeding 800 mg, do not derive benefit 
proportional to the increase in exposure. The SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
Safety in different Body weight groups 
Weight 
In the All Control population, the rate of serious infections was higher in patients weighing > 60 kg and 
treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg, with the greatest increase observed in patients weighing > 100 kg.  
In the All Exposure population, the rate of serious infections was 3.3 per 100 patient-years for patients  
< 60 kg, 4.2 per 100 patient-years for patients ≥ 60 to < 80 kg, 5.0 per 100 patient-years for patients 
≥ 80 to < 100 kg, and 8.5 per 100 patient-years for patients ≥ 100 kg. 
BMI 
In the All Control population, patients with very low (< 18.5) or very high (≥ 30) BMI and treated with 
TCZ 8 mg/kg reported the highest rate of serious infections.  
In the All Exposure population, the rate of serious infections was 4.4 per 100 patient-years for patients 
with a BMI < 18.5, 3.2 per 100 patient-years for patients with a BMI ≥ 18.5 to < 24.9 kg, 4.4 per 100 
patient-years for patients with a BMI ≥ 25 to < 29.9, and 6.2 per 100 patient-years for patients with a 
BMI ≥ 30. 
Discussion on dosing by body weight/PK/PD relationship 
The use of TCZ 8 mg/kg has been demonstrated as an effective regimen both as monotherapy and in 
combination with MTX/other DMARDs. The influence of body weight on systemic clearance supports the 
dosing of TCZ on a milligram per kilogram basis in the majority of patients. 
From  the  population  PK  analysis  included  in  the  original  submission  it  is  known  that  TCZ-treated 
patients  with  high  body  weight  have  higher  AUC,  Cmax,  and  Cmin  values  compared  to  patients  with 
low body weight, who have relatively lower AUC, Cmax, and Cmin. 
It is agreed that the TCZ effect approached the plateau of the response curve at 8 mg/kg dose (Cmin 
to  Cmax)  and  that  further  increase  of  exposure  would  result  in  minimal  reduction  in  DAS  formation 
rate.  
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 8/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Long-term  follow-up  results  confirmed  previous  findings  that  the  best  responses  were  observed  in 
patients who were < 60 kg and that, as patient weight increased, the response to TCZ therapy slightly 
decreased. Although exposure increases as patient weight increased (e.g. AUC in patients weighing > 
100 kg is 55000 compared to 36000 in the 60-80 kg subgroup), the response to TCZ therapy does not 
increase  proportionally.  This  is  in  agreement  with  the  sigmoidal  concentration-response  relationship 
evaluated.  Simulated  response  data  confirmed that administration  of  the  maximum  total dose of  800 
mg in patients weighing > 100 kg results in response levels that are comparable to those obtained with 
the dose of 8 mg/kg. This means that capping the dose at 800 mg for these patients will not limit the 
efficacy  in  this  population.  The  rate  of  serious  infections  per  100  patient  years  after  TCZ  8  mg/kg 
increases  by  body  weight  from  3.4  to  10.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  increase  in  TCZ  exposure 
(AUC,  Cmax  and  Cmin)  by  body  weight  since  there  is  a  relationship  between  TCZ  concentration  and 
neutrophil  loss  rate.  This  indicates  that  the  subgroup  >  100  kg  bears  the  highest  risk  for  infections. 
Since no increase in response is observed in this group this finding supports the proposed capping of 
the dose at 800 mg. 
Since  patients  weighing  less  than  60  kg  had  the  highest  efficacy  in  both  the  6  month  studies  and  in 
long-term follow-up in the All Exposure population, the overall exposure to TCZ in this group appears 
to be sufficient, indicating that a minimum dose of 480 mg is not required.  
The current safety data also indicate the trend on increased incidence of serious infections in patients 
with low BMI (<18.5) without such finding in patients with <60 kg of weight. The MAH has provided a 
conclusive overview of the data regarding the connection between low body weight/ low BMI and the 
possibly  increased  risk  of  serious  infection.  No  direct  link  between  low  BMI  and  higher  risk  can  be 
assumed but the number of concomitant diseases and underlying risk factors should lead to a cautious 
treatment with RoActemra. 
3.3.2 Clinical efficacy 
The clinical data presented in support of the current application derive from a planned interim analysis 
of  1  year  radiographic  and  physical  function  data,  confirmed  with  results  from  an  analysis  of  2  year 
data from study WA17823. This application is further supported by cumulative long-term efficacy and 
safety  data  from  the  open-label  extension  phase  of  study  WA17823  and  the  two  ongoing  open  label 
extension  studies  (WA18695  and  WA18696),  which  include  patients  from  the  core  studies  in  the 
original application. 
The  cumulative  long-term  clinical  database  includes  patients  from  controlled  studies  WA17822, 
WA17823,  WA17824,  WA18062,  WA18063  and  WP18663  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  TCZ, 
regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  entered  long-term  extension  studies  WA18695  or  WA18696  or 
continued  into the  extension  phase  of  study  WA17823.  For  the long-term  evaluation  of  efficacy,  data 
from  TCZ  treated  patients  in  these  studies  are  pooled  with  the  data  from  the  extension  phase  of 
WA17823  and  the  extension  studies  WA18695  and  WA18696.  Up  to  the  cut-off  date  for  this 
submission,  the  4009  patients  included  in  this  population  provide  a  total  of  8579.7  patient-years 
exposure to TCZ, with over 1000 patients treated for 156 weeks (3 years). This is referred to as the All 
Exposure population and is the primary population for the assessment of long-term safety and efficacy 
of TCZ.  
A subset of this population, comprising only data from double-blind controlled trials, was also analyzed 
for  safety.  This  analysis  censors  the  data  from  the  point  that  a  patient  changes  treatment  regimen. 
Change  in  treatment  regimen  includes:  entering  escape  therapy,  changing  TCZ  dose,  or  switching  to 
open  label  TCZ.  This  is  referred  to  as  the  All  Control  population.  Under  controlled  conditions  in  the 
Phase III studies, 1555 patients received control treatment, 774 patients received TCZ 4 mg/kg, and 
1870 patients received TCZ 8 mg/kg.

Main study 
WA17823 
Study  WA17823  was  a  phase  III,  multi-centre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  parallel 
group study in patients with moderate to severe RA who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients 
were randomized to receive study drug (TCZ 4 mg/kg, TCZ 8 mg/kg, or placebo) in combination with 
MTX  in  year  1,  followed  by  open-label  treatment  with  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  in  year  2.  The  study  was 
designed  to  assess  TCZ  therapy  in  combination  with  MTX  versus  MTX  alone  with  respect  to  safety, 
reduction in signs and symptoms of RA after 6 months, prevention of joint damage at one year (with 
confirmation at two years), and improvement in physical function at one year (with confirmation at two 
years).  The  interim  analysis  of  24-week  data,  which  demonstrated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  TCZ  in 
reducing the signs and symptoms of RA, was reported in the initial MAA. 
Eligible patients were randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the following treatment groups: 
•Group  A:  TCZ  4  mg/kg  intravenously  (iv)  every  4  weeks  (q4w)  in  combination  with  MTX  (10  to  25 
mg orally or parenterally) weekly 
•Group B: TCZ 8 mg/kg iv q4w in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg orally or parenterally) weekly 
•Group C: Placebo iv q4w in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg orally or parenterally) weekly 
Figure 2 
Patient Population 
A  total  of  1196  patients  were  enrolled in  study  WA17823.  Patients  were  recruited  at  multiple  centres 
worldwide:  41%  from  Europe,  40%  from  North  America  (27%  from  the  USA),  10%  from  Brazil,  5% 
from South Africa, and 4% from China. 
The  patient  disposition  for  the  1190  patients  randomized  to  treatment  was  as  follows:  393  placebo; 
399 TCZ 4 mg/kg; and 398 TCZ 8 mg/kg. 
The patients in study WA17823 were selected as moderate to severely active RA patients with erosive 
joint disease; to be enrolled in the study they had to have radiographic evidence of at least one joint 
with definite erosion attributable to RA, as determined by the central reading site.

Certain subpopulations were excluded from the study, such as pregnant or lactating women, patients 
with  renal  impairment,  and  patients  with  liver  disorders.  The  majority  of  patients  were  recruited  in 
North America, Europe and South/Central America. At study entry, patient ages ranged from 18 to 84 
years (median 51 to 54 years) across the treatment groups. 
After week 52, patients were required to switch to open-label treatment with 8 mg/kg TCZ, unless they 
were maintaining a very good response (> 70% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC)/tender joint 
count  (TJC).  The  proportion  of  patients  who  made  this  switch  ranged  from  62%  to  68%  of  patients 
across the three treatment groups. Fifteen (15) percent of placebo patients and 22% of TCZ patients 
(both doses) qualified to continue on double-blind treatment at week 52. 
At  104  weeks,  73%  of  patients  originally  randomized  to  placebo  and  78%  of  patients  originally 
randomized  to  TCZ  (both  dose  groups)  completed  the  core  study.  Approximately  10%  to 13%  of  the 
originally  randomized  patients  were  receiving  double-blind  treatment  at  this  time;  the  remaining 
patients were receiving open-label TCZ 8-mg/kg treatment. 
Dose and Dosing Regimen 
Doses  investigated  in  the  Phase  III  studies,  including  study  WA17823,  were  selected  on  the  basis  of 
safety  and  efficacy  data  from  the  Chugai  16-week  Phase  II  dose-ranging  study  LRO301  in  MTX 
inadequate responders. This study included TCZ doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg of TCZ given alone or in 
combination with MTX. Based on the positive outcome of these studies, TCZ  doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg 
were explored in the MAH’s Phase III studies. A 4-weekly dosing interval was primarily chosen based 
on data from the same study demonstrating clinical improvements at 2 and 4 weeks after an infusion 
of TCZ. 
During  year  1  of  the  core  study,  patients  received  an  infusion  of  TCZ  or  placebo  q4w  in  a  blinded 
fashion for a total of 13 infusions. Patients who failed to respond to treatment (i.e., achieved less than 
a  20%  improvement  in  both  the  SJC  and  tender  joint  count  TJC)  after  16  weeks  of  blinded  therapy 
were offered escape therapy with TCZ. 
Year 2 of the core study started after completion of 52 weeks of treatment. Patients who completed 52 
weeks  of  double-blind  treatment,  or  received  TCZ  escape  therapy  in  year  1,  received  open-label 
treatment  with  8  mg/kg  TCZ  infusions  q4w  for  12  months  in  year  2  of  the  study.  However,  patients 
doing  well  on  blinded  therapy  at  week  52  (defined  as  showing  ≥  70%  improvement  from  baseline  in 
SJC  and  TJC  at  two  consecutive  visits  [weeks  48  and  52])  were  allowed  to  continue  on  their  current 
treatment  in  year  2  in  a  blinded  fashion.  The  treatment  blind  was  maintained  until  the  last  patient 
completed  the  week  52  visit  and  the  clinical  study  database  for  year  1  was  locked.  Patients  could 
switch to open-label treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg at any time until week 104. 
Endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints in study WA17823 at weeks 52 and 104 were: 
• the change from baseline in total Sharp-Genant score and, 
• the change the change in physical function at weeks 52 and 104, measured by the area under the 
curve (AUC) for the change from baseline in HAQ-DI.  
Radiographs of each hand and wrist (posterior anterior) and each foot (anterior posterior) were taken 
at  specified  time  points.  Radiographs  were  read  in  two  reading  campaigns.  Campaign  1  included 
evaluations of the baseline, week 24, week 52, and early withdrawal or escape therapy readings taken 
up to the week 52 visit. Campaign 2 included evaluations of the baseline, week 24, week 52, week 80, 
week 104, and early withdrawal or escape therapy readings taken up to the week 104 visit. Campaign 
1  assessments  were  used  for  the  year  1  analysis;  those  of  campaign  2  were  used  for  the  year  2

analysis.  The  data  from  the  different  campaigns  were  not  mixed  for  a  given  patient.  The  primary 
radiographic endpoint was the change from baseline in total Sharp-Genant score at weeks 52 and 104.  
Supporting Studies (WA18695, WA18696, and WA17823 Long-Term Extension Studies)  
The  primary  objective  of  these  studies  is  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  of  TCZ  8  mg/kg  as 
monotherapy or in combination with background DMARDs therapy  with regard to adverse events and 
laboratory result abnormalities. Secondary objectives include assessment of continuing clinical benefit 
using the same measures as in the core studies. Efficacy parameters were assessed every 12 weeks in 
WA18695 and WA18696, and every 8 weeks in study WA17823. Data for these patients were included 
in this summary up to the cut off point of February 6, 2009. 
Table 3 
The  efficacy  analyses  for  the  supporting  studies  were  performed  on  the  All  Exposure  population, 
consisting  of  all  patients  from  the  core  studies  (WA17822,  WA17823,  WA17824  [including  the 
transition  phase],  WA18062,  WA18063)  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  active  TCZ,  regardless  of 
whether  they  entered  an  extension  study,  and  those  from  the  WA17823,  WA18695,  and  WA18696 
extension studies. (Note: study WP18663 was a phase 1 study with no efficacy endpoints; efficacy data 
for  patients  initially  enrolled  into  WP18633  became  available  only  when  those  patients  entered 
WA18696).  
Results 
Study WA17823 
Results at Week 52 
Treatment with TCZ 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg + MTX reduced the rate of prevention joint damage (PJD) 
compared with placebo + MTX, as demonstrated by the change in Total Sharp Score TSS at year 1 (p 
≤  0.0001  for  both  comparisons  versus  placebo).  While  the  primary  analysis  compared  the  entire 
distribution,  the  mean  values  were  0.34,  0.29,  and  1.13  for  the  TCZ  4  mg/kg,  TCZ  8  mg/kg,  and 
placebo  groups,  respectively.  The  reduction  in  PJD  was  driven  mainly  by  a  statistically  significant 
change (p ≤ 0.0001 for both comparisons) in erosion score (mean change of 0.21 for TCZ 4 mg/kg and 
0.17 for TCZ 8 mg/kg versus 0.71 for placebo). Joint space narrowing scores also showed statistically 
significant  improvement  with  TCZ  4-  and  8-mg/kg  therapy  as  compared  with  placebo  (p  <  0.05  for 
both  comparisons;  mean  change  in  JSN  score  of  0.13  and  0.12  versus  0.42,  respectively).  The 
robustness  of  the  primary  analysis  was  supported  by  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  confirming  a 
significantly lower rate of PJD in the TCZ-treated groups as compared with placebo.  
Treatment  with  TCZ  was  also  associated  with  a  significantly  greater  proportion  of  patients  with  no 
radiographic  progression  over  one  year  compared  with  the  placebo  +  MTX  group  (80.5%  for  TCZ  4 
mg/kg and 84.5% for TCZ 8 mg/kg compared with 67.2% for placebo). 
A  statistically  significant  improvement  in  physical  function,  as  assessed  by  the  co-primary  functional 
endpoint HAQ-DI AUC,  was observed for patients receiving TCZ (both doses) compared with placebo. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 12/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
In  addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  clinically  important  change  in  HAQ-DI  (decrease  from 
baseline by 0.3) was significantly greater for patients receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX than for patients 
receiving placebo + MTX. The proportions of patients achieving ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses at 
week 52 were significantly greater in both TCZ groups compared with the control group. Moreover, the 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  TCZ  groups  who  achieved  a  major  clinical  response  (defined  as 
achievement  of  ACR70  response  for  ≥  6  months)  (4.0%  and  6.5%  for  the  4-  and  8-mg/kg  groups, 
respectively) differed significantly from that of the placebo group (0.5%; p = 0.0010 and p < 0.0001). 
Both  TCZ-treated  groups  showed  a  greater  decrease  in  DAS28  scores  compared  with  the  control 
group;  the  mean  change  from  baseline  for  the  8-mg/kg  group  differed  significantly  from  that  for 
placebo  (p  <  0.0001).  By  week  52,  nearly  half  (47%)  of  TCZ  8  mg/kg  patients  achieved  remission 
(DAS28 < 2.6) compared with 8% of placebo patients. 
Results at Week 104 
For the year 2 analyses, patients were included in the groups to which they were initially randomized. 
It  is  important  to  note  that,  due  to  the  study  design,  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
received escape treatment (TCZ 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) in  year 1, and in the  TCZ 4-mg/kg group, the 
majority of patients received treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg for at least 12 months through year 2. 
Disposition of Radiographic Data 
In the ITT population at week 104, 1147 patients (96%) had a baseline and at least one post-baseline 
radiographic  assessment.  A  total  of  915  patients  (77%)  had  a  baseline  and  a  week  104  radiograph 
(293/393 [75%] of placebo patients, 311/399 [78%] of patients on TCZ 4 mg/kg, and 311/399 [78%] 
of patients on TCZ 8 mg/kg). 
The  primary  analysis,  which  censored  post-escape  and  post-withdrawal  data,  included  x-ray 
assessments for 75% of placebo patients (294/393), 86% of patients (343/399) on TCZ 4 mg/kg and 
89% of patients (353/398) on TCZ 8 mg/kg. Of those patients, 140 in the placebo group, 231 in the 4-
mg/kg  group  and  252  in  the  8-mg/kg  group  had  both  a  baseline  and  a  week  104  radiograph  and, 
therefore, represented the observed change. The  number of patients who had their week 104 results 
imputed  using  linear  extrapolation  included  154,  112,  and  101  patients  in  the  placebo  and  TCZ  4-
mg/kg,  and  8-mg/kg  groups,  respectively.  Data  for  these  patients  were  imputed  because  their 
observed  week  104  data  were  set  to  missing  (escape  or  post-withdrawal  data)  (95,  49  and  37 
patients),  or  because  they  were  truly  missing  (includes  early  withdrawals  for  patients  with  no  post-
withdrawal data) at week 104 (59, 63 and 64 patients. 
Key Findings for efficacy 
Both  of  the  co-primary  endpoints  for  WA17823  were  met  at  week  104.  Initial  treatment  with  TCZ  4 
mg/kg  and  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  significantly  reduced  the  rate  of  progression  of  joint  damage  compared 
with placebo + MTX, as demonstrated by the change in TSS at year 2 (p ≤ 0.025 for both comparisons 
versus  placebo).  A  significantly  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  group  had  no 
progression of joint damage (change from baseline ≤0 TSS) at the end of year 2 compared with those 
randomized to placebo, as assessed by the change in TSS (75% and 83% in the 4-mg/kg and 8-mg/kg 
groups,  respectively,  vs.  66%  for  patients  randomized  to  placebo;  p  =  0.024  and  p  <  0.0001, 
respectively). Moreover, the proportion of non-progressors was greater in the second year for all three 
treatment  groups  (with  post-withdrawal  and  escape  data  included),  including  patients  originally 
randomized to placebo (most of whom were receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg at this time), as compared to that 
observed at the end of year 1. Results for all radiographic endpoints at week 104 showed maintenance 
of effect or further improvement in the benefits obtained in the first year of the study. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 13/37
 
 
   
 
 
At  week  104,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI  AUC  (co-primary  endpoint)  was 
significantly greater for both TCZ groups as compared with the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Analysis of 
categorical  changes  in  HAQ-DI  scores  at  week  104  showed  that  over  62%  of  patients  randomized  to 
TCZ  8  mg/kg  improved  by  ≥  0.3units,  showing  maintenance  of  the  year  1  levels.  Additionally,  the 
proportion of patients showing a minimum clinically important difference in HAQDI (defined as ≥ 0.25) 
was maintained or improved slightly from the year 1 levels.  
The ACR20/50/70 response rates achieved in year 1 were maintained throughout year 2. Moreover, at 
week  104  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  major  clinical  response  in  the  TCZ  groups  increased 
more  than  2-fold  from  the  week  52  levels  (11.5%  and  14.3%  of  patients  in  the  4-  and  8-mg/kg 
groups, respectively). 
Mean DAS28 scores continued to decrease for all treatment groups. At week 104, the mean score for 
the  8  mg/kg  group  exceeded  the  DAS28  threshold  for  clinical  remission  (mean  score  of  2.55),  while 
scores  for  both  the  placebo  and  4-mg/kg  groups  approached  that  threshold  (2.75  and  2.81, 
respectively,  with  post  withdrawal/  escape  data  included).  Approximately  half  (48%)  of  the  patients 
treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg and 31% of those treated with 4 mg/kg achieved DAS 28 remission at week 
52; these proportions increased to 65% and 55%, respectively, at week 104. 
Progression of Joint Damage 
Patients  enrolled  in  study  WA17823  had  low  radiographic  progression  rates  at  baseline;  mean 
annualized  progression  rates  were  4.19,  4.31,  and  4.09  in  the  placebo  +  MTX,  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX, 
and TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, respectively. 
The proportions of patients with a radiograph at both baseline and week 52 were 83%, 89%, and 84% 
in  the  placebo  +  MTX,  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX,  and  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  groups,  respectively.  At  week 
104,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  a  radiograph  both  at  baseline  and  week  104  remained  high  at 
75%, 78%, and 78% for the respective groups. 
Treatment  with  TCZ  +  MTX  significantly  reduced  the  progression  of  joint  damage  compared  with 
placebo + MTX, as assessed by the change in total Sharp-Genant score at year 1 with a 74% and 70% 
inhibition  of  progression  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  and  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  groups,  respectively, 
when compared with placebo + MTX. 
This  significant  reduction  in  the  progression  of  joint  damage  was  confirmed  following  2  years  of 
treatment.  The  data  at  year  2  reflect  an  81%  and 70%  inhibition  of  progression  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg 
and 4 mg/kg groups, respectively, when compared with placebo. 
The changes in total Sharp score were also supported by the changes in both erosion and joint space 
narrowing scores.

Table 4 
Differences  in  the  change  from  baseline  in  the  total  Sharp  score  among  the  three  treatment  groups 
became evident as early as week 24, when patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX or TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+ MTX had a significantly smaller change compared with patients treated with placebo + MTX. Between 
weeks 24 and 52, patients treated with TCZ + MTX continued to have smaller changes in total Sharp 
score than patients treated with placebo. At week 52, when the majority of patients switched to open-
label treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, the slope of the line for patients initially treated with placebo 
+ MTX decreases, indicating that these patients had a smaller change in total Sharp score during the 
second  year  of  treatment  compared  with  the  first.  For  patients  initially  treated  with  TCZ  4  mg/kg  + 
MTX,  the  slope  of  the  line  at  week  52  continues  in  an  approximately  linear  fashion,  indicating  that 
these patients continue to experience a change in total Sharp score during year 2 that is similar to the 
change  in  year  1.  For  patients  originally  randomized  to  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX,  the  slope  of  the  line  at 
week  52  decreases  slightly,  suggesting  that  these  patients  experience  even  less  of  a  change  in  total 
Sharp  score  during  year  2.  Similar  results  were  seen  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  including  post-escape 
and post withdrawal data, which confirm the findings of the primary analysis.

Figure 4 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  no  radiographic  progression  (defined  as  ≤  0  in  total  Sharp-Genant 
score)  was  greater  in  the  TCZ  groups  (78.1%  and  83.3%  in  the  4-  and  8-mg/kg  +  MTX  groups, 
respectively)  compared  with  the  placebo  +  MTX  group  (65.6%)  at  week  52.  These  results  were 
maintained at week 104  with significantly greater  proportions of patients with  no progression in total 
Sharp  score  in  the  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  (74.6%,  p=0.0239)  and  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  (82.7%, 
p<0.0001)  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  +  MTX  group  (66.3%).  Similar  results  were  observed

when  considering  the  proportion  of  patients  with  no  progression  in  erosion  or  joint  space  narrowing 
scores. 
Annualized Rates of Progression 
The exploratory analysis to compare the annualized progression rates for TSS, erosion and JSN scores 
suggested  that  patients  randomized  to  TCZ  8  mg/kg  who  received  more  than  1  year  of  treatment 
experienced significantly less structural damage in year 2 compared to year 1 (rate of progression for 
TSS 0.07 vs. 0.24 [p<0.0001]; erosion 0.04 vs. 0.13 [p = 0.0007]; JSN 0.04 vs. 0.11 [p = 0.0002]). 
Similarly,  rates  of  progression  in  year  2  for  patients  randomized  to  placebo  (the  majority  of  whom 
switched to TCZ 8 mg/kg at week 52) showed significantly less PJD versus year 1 (rates for: TSS, 0.1 
vs. 0.86; erosion, 0.04 vs. 0.56; JSN, 0.07 vs. 0.31 [p<0.0001 for all three comparisons]). 
The rate of progression in radiographic scores for patients randomized to TCZ 4 mg/kg (the majority of 
whom  switched  to  TCZ  8  mg/kg  in  year  2),  was  significantly  lower  in  year  2  versus  year  1  for  TSS 
(0.16  vs.  0.25;  p  =  0.0346)  and  JSN  (0.06  vs.  0.09;  p  =  0.0138).  The  rate  of  progression  for  the 
erosion  score  was  lower  in  year  2  versus  year  1,  but  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
(0.09 vs. 0.16; p = 0.1425). 
Physical Function 
Patients in study WA17823 had mean baseline HAQ-DI scores of 1.5 (all treatment groups). Treatment 
with  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  or  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  resulted  in  a  statistically  significantly  greater 
improvement in physical function compared with placebo + MTX at week 52, as assessed by the mean 
HAQ-DI AUC. This improvement and significant difference between treatment groups were maintained 
at week 104, even after most patients had switched to open label treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg. These 
results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses that included post-escape data. 
Table 5 
The  results  for  the  primary  endpoint  are  supported  by  the  analysis  of  the  secondary  endpoint  of  a 
HAQ-DI  change  from  baseline  of  ≥  0.3,  which  showed  clinically  and  statistically  significantly  higher 
proportions  of  patients  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  group  (71%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group 
(62%) achieving this clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52. The proportion of patients 
achieving  the  greatest  degree  of  improvement  of  ≥0.75  was  also  higher  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX

group (37%) compared with the placebo + MTX group (28.1%). Improvements in all categories were 
also observed in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group, although the difference was not statistically significant 
when compared with placebo + MTX. These improvements were maintained at week 104. 
Improvement in physical function over time 
Patients randomized to TCZ + MTX showed a faster improvement in HAQ-DI in the first year compared 
to the patients randomized to placebo + MTX. The increased rate of improvement in the control group 
after  week  16  may  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  50%  of  the  control  patients  switched  to  escape 
therapy.  In  the  second  year  of  the  study,  when  the  majority  of  patients  received  open-label  TCZ  8 
mg/kg + MTX, patients in the placebo + MTX group had a further decrease in HAQ-DI, but the mean 
remained at a higher level compared with patients treated with TCZ. While the mean HAQ-DI score for 
patients  initially  randomized  to  TCZ  4  and  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  continued  to  decrease  in  year  2,  the 
magnitude  of  decrease  in  mean  HAQ-DI  score  for  patients  randomized  to  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  was 
greater as patients switched to open-label treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg during this period. 
The  improvement  in  physical  function  as  shown  in  HAQ-DI  scores  was  supported  by  the  results  for 
other patient-reported outcomes, including improvements in physical function scores for the functional 
assessment  of  chronic  illness  therapy  (FACIT)  fatigue  scale  and  the  SF-36.  At  year  1,  significant 
differences  between  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  and  placebo  groups  were  obtained  with  both  SF-36  physical 
component score and FACIT fatigue scores (p < 0.05), and these effects were maintained up to year 2. 
In  the  comparison  for  the  TCZ  4-mg/kg  group,  p  <  0.05;  however,  this  occurred  after  the  break  in 
hierarchical ordered testing sequence. 
Maintenance of HAQ-DI Improvements 
The proportion of patients at weeks 52 and 104 who maintained a HAQ-DI improvement of ≥ 0.30 for 
up to 24, 36, and 48 weeks was greater for patients randomized to TCZ 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg than for 
those  randomized  to  placebo  when  escape  data  were  set  to  missing,  and  when  escape  data  were 
included. The percentage of patients who had a HAQ-DI of 0 at week 104 (excluding escape data) was 
higher for patients randomized to TCZ 4 mg/kg (15.0%) and TCZ 8 mg/kg (15.4%) than for patients 
who  were  randomized  to  placebo  (10.9%).  A  similar  trend  was  observed  when  escape  data  were 
included. 
The data from study WA17823 are supported by the results of an exploratory analysis of pooled data 
from  the  extension  phase  of  study  WA17823  and  the  open  label  extension  studies  WA18695  and 
WA18696.  In  this  analysis,  HAQ-DI  scores  were  re-base  lined  after  24  weeks  of  TCZ  treatment  to 
assess  whether  there  was  further  improvement  following  the  initial  large  improvement  in  HAQ-DI 
observed after 24 weeks. Further improvement was seen, however the effect was small (- 0.046, 95% 
CI [-0.056, -0.037]). These results demonstrate that the effect on physical function status after week 
24 in patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg was not only maintained but continued to improve throughout 
the 3 year observation period. 
Reductions  in  HAQ-DI  scores  were  demonstrated  in  both  an  aggregate  trends  model  and  in  a  mixed 
effects model. 
Reduction of signs and symptoms 
ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 Responses 
The proportion of patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses in the TCZ 4- and 8-mg/kg 
groups  at  week  52  was  significantly  greater  than  that  in  the  placebo  group  (p  <  0.0001  for  all 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 18/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
comparisons. Between the two TCZ groups, numerically greater response rates were seen with the 8- 
as compared with the 4-mg/kg dose. 
Figure 5 
The ACR20/50/70 response rates (excluding escape data and including escape data) achieved in year 1 
were maintained throughout year 2. Following initiation of open-label TCZ 8-mg/kg treatment at week 
52, the placebo and 4-mg/kg groups showed a rapid increase to response levels similar to those seen 
for  patients  in  the  8-mg/kg  group.  For  patients  receiving  TCZ  8  mg/kg,  ACR50  and  ACR70  response 
rates  increased  between  week  52  and  week  104  (from  36%  to  39%  and  from  20%  to  22%, 
respectively). 
DAS28 Response 
• Patients receiving TCZ treatment on average showed continuous improvement in DAS28 scores over 
2 years; the greatest improvements in DAS28 response were observed with the TCZ 8 mg/kg dose 
• The proportion of patients achieving DAS28 remission increased continuously over 2 years treatment 
with TCZ 
• Patients who switched from control or TCZ 4 mg/kg to TCZ 8 mg/kg at week 52 showed considerable 
improvement in DAS28 scores at week 104  
At week 52, both TCZ-treated groups showed a significantly greater decrease in DAS28 compared with 
the control group (p < 0.001 for both comparisons); the greatest mean change from baseline in DAS28 
was  observed  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  group.  In  the  TCZ  8-mg/kg  group,  mean  scores  approached  the 
DAS28 threshold for clinical remission (< 2.6) at the end of the 52-week treatment period (mean score 
of 2.77; ITT population, escape data excluded). 
In the second year of study WA17823 when the majority of patients received open label TCZ 8 mg/kg, 
mean DAS28 scores continued to decrease for all treatment groups. At week 104, mean DAS scores for 
both the placebo and 4-mg/kg groups approached the DAS28 threshold for clinical remission (2.75 and 
2.81,  respectively),  while  the  8-mg/kg  group  attained  the  lowest  mean  DAS28  score,  2.55  (escape 
data  included).  Results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  for  mean  DAS28  score  and  DAS28  mean  change 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 19/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
from baseline (including escape data and excluding escape data) were similar to those of the primary 
analysis. 
At week 104, both proportions of patients in DAS28 remission and those achieving low disease activity 
showed a further increase from year 1. The TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group continued to show the greatest 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  these  targets,  with  nearly  two-thirds  of  high-dose  patients  achieving 
DAS28  remission  and  76%  showing  low  disease  activity.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  DAS28 
remission/disease activity showed similar improvements for year 2. 
EULAR Response 
Consistent with the results for DAS28, the proportion of patients achieving a moderate or good EULAR 
response  was  greater  in  the  TCZ  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group  at  week  52.  The  percentage  of 
patients  who  achieved  a  good  or  moderate  EULAR  response  increased  further  in  year  2  for  patients 
randomized to placebo or TCZ 4 mg/kg, and was maintained for patients randomized to TCZ 8 mg/kg, 
with half of the patients in this group achieving a EULAR good response. 
Dose Recommendation 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  6-month  controlled  trials  in  the  marketing  authorisation  application,  the 
dose  of  TCZ  8  mg/kg  was  recommended  for  treatment  of  signs  and  symptoms.  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX 
has been shown to be effective regarding the prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical 
function  as  assessed  in  study  WA17823,  and  supported  by  the  maintenance  of  efficacy  for  the  long-
term data in the open-label extension studies. 
Study  WA17823  was  not  formally  designed  to  compare  results  for  the  two  TCZ  doses;  however,  the 
results  support  previous  findings,  which  showed  numerically  better  responses  for  patients  receiving 
TCZ  8  mg/kg  as  compared  with  4  mg/kg.  Radiographic  data  indicated  a  greater  inhibition  of 
radiographic progression over 2 years for patients randomized to TCZ 8 mg/kg as compared with those 
who  started  the  study  on  4  mg/kg.  The  higher  dose  showed  a  74%  inhibition  of  radiographic 
progression  at  week  52,  which  increased  to  81%  at  week  104.  The  4-  mg/kg  group  showed  an 
inhibition of 70% at both time points. 
Similarly, the increase from year 1 to year 2 in the proportion of patients without progression of joint 
damage (TSS ≤ 0) was greater for the TCZ 8-mg/kg group (83% in year 1 versus 93% in year 2) as 
compared  with  the  4-mg/gkg  group  (78%  versus  81%).  Moreover,  annualized  progression  rates  for 
TSS  showed  a  further  decrease  in    progression  of  joint  damage  after  patients  switched  from  TCZ  4 
mg/kg to 8 mg/kg (-68% in annualized progression rate before the switch). 
The TCZ 8-mg/kg group showed a greater magnitude of improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 compared 
with  the  control  group  (translating  into  a  statistically  greater  proportion  of  patients  with  an 
improvement  of  0.3  [63%;  p  =  0.0389]).  HAQ-DI  scores  for  TCZ  4  mg/kg  differed  numerically  from 
those  of  control  (60%;  p  =  0.1909).  A  greater  proportion  of  TCZ  8  mg/kg  patients  achieved 
ACR20/50/70 responses and DAS28 clinical remission compared with patients receiving 4 mg/kg. 
Persistence of Efficacy 
Long-term efficacy data were obtained in a total of 4009 patients for up to 192 weeks, including over 
1000 patients treated for 156 weeks (3 years). Maintenance of the clinical benefit of TCZ for up to 192 
weeks  was  assessed  using  pooled  data  (All  Exposure  population)  from  the  core  studies  and  the 
ongoing, open-label extension studies (WA18695 and WA18696 and patients in WA17823 continuing in 
the long term extension portion of that trial). In these studies, baseline was defined as the first active 
dose of TCZ (either in the core or the extension study). Key efficacy data are provided from the time 
patients received their first dose of TCZ up to the cut off date of February 6, 2009.

Patients Withdrawn from Treatment 
As of the data cut-off point (February 6, 2009), 1064 patients (26.5%) had withdrawn from treatment. 
A  small  proportion  of  these  were  patients  discontinued  due  to  insufficient  therapeutic  response 
(152/4009, 3.8%). 
The  WA18062  (anti-TNF  non-responders)  group  had  the  greatest  proportion  of  withdrawals  due  to 
insufficient  therapeutic  response  (2.4%,  10.6%,  and  2.9%  for  the  WA17824,  WA18062,  and  Pooled 
groups, respectively). 
All patients received TCZ  8 mg/kg on entering the  extension studies. Efficacy was assessed every 12 
weeks  (every  8  weeks  in  WA17823)  and  summarized  in  three  study  groups  within  the  All  Exposure 
population, according to the type of patient population treated in the core study:  
1) the Pooled group (consisting of patients with inadequate response to MTX/DMARDs randomized into 
WA17822, WA17823, or WA18063);  
2) the WA17824 (monotherapy) group;  
3) the WA18062 (anti-TNF inadequate responders) group. 
Efficacy  was  either  maintained  or  continued  to  improve  with  duration  of  treatment  in  patients  who 
received TCZ, as demonstrated by continued improvements in ACR responses  and DAS28 and EULAR 
scores  (no  radiographic  assessments  were  performed).  Most  notable  was  the  incremental  benefit 
provided  over  time,  as  demonstrated  by  increasing  proportions  of  patients  achieving  the  higher 
response levels for efficacy. In addition, patients who were initially randomized to TCZ 4 mg/kg in the 
core study showed further improvement after switching to 8 mg/kg therapy in the extension studies. 
These patterns of improvement were evident in all study populations. Patients in the WA17824 group 
(who  started  on  monotherapy  treatment  and  could  remain  on  it  during  the  extension  phase) 
consistently showed the best responses for all parameters, reflecting their earlier stage of disease and 
history of fewer failed DMARDs. Those in the WA18062 (anti-TNF non-responders) group generally had 
relatively  lower  responses,  reflecting  the  later  stage  and  refractory  nature  of  their  disease.  These 
patients nevertheless showed considerable improvement over time.  
The  majority  of  patients  in  the  extension  studies  were  receiving  concomitant  background  DMARD 
therapy. However, in core study WA17824 and its extension study WA18695, patients received TCZ as 
monotherapy (patients were permitted to add background DMARDs in the extension phase). In the All 
Exposure  Population,  the  WA17824  group  consisted  of  all  patients  who  received  TCZ,  including  those 
who were randomized to MTX and later switched to open label TCZ 8 mg/kg. An analysis of a subgroup 
of 234 patients who received only TCZ 8 mg/kg as monotherapy throughout the core (WA17824) and 
extension  study  (up  to  the  data  cut)  also  demonstrated  maintenance  of,  or  further  improvement  in, 
ACR response rates and DAS28/EULAR scores. 
Patients Who Experienced Loss of Efficacy 
A total of 152 patients in the All Exposure population withdrew for insufficient therapeutic response. Of 
these, 66 (43.4%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies at any time, including baseline. Anti-drug 
antibodies  have  been  associated  with  a  loss  of  clinical  efficacy  in  patients  treated  with  biological 
therapies. Approximately one third of patients (14 of 34 tested; 35 total) who had an ACR50 or DAS28 
EULAR good response prior to withdrawing due to a lack of efficacy had a positive neutralizing antibody 
test post baseline. 
A  total  of  127  patients  (3.2%  of  total  population)  had  tested  positive  for  neutralizing  antibodies;  of 
these,  66  (52.0%  of  neutralizing  antibody-positive  population)  withdrew  for  lack  of  efficacy  and  14 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 21/37
 
 
   
 
 
(11.0% of neutralizing antibody-positive population and 0.36% of the 3937 patients tested) achieved 
good efficacy but subsequently lost it. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  results  of  Study  WA17823,  obtained  by  the  interim  analysis  at  Week  24,  have  already  been 
evaluated during the previous submission. There were no objections on this data.  
The  two  co-primary  endpoints  have  been  met  and  consistent  results  are  demonstrated  compared  to 
the  MAA.  Inhibition  of  structural  damage  and  improvement  of  physical  function  at  week  52  is 
demonstrated. Efficacy is maintained as assessed by ACR20, DAS28 and EULAR response data. ACR50 
and ACR70 assessment at week 52 indicate a sufficient response rate, expectedly on a lower fraction of 
patients.  This  analysis  shows  that  response  is  continually  maintained  in  a  considerable  fraction  of 
patients until the week 52 assessment. 
Both of the co-primary endpoints were met at week 104. Treatment with TCZ 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg + 
MTX  reduced  the  rate  of  progression  of  joint  damage  compared  with  placebo  +  MTX.  A  greater 
proportion of patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group had no progression of joint damage at the end of year 
2  compared  with  patients  randomized  to  placebo.  Results  for  all  radiographic  endpoints  at  week  104 
showed maintenance of effect with regard the benefits obtained in the first year of the study. 
The  examination  of  radiographic  endpoints  at  week  52  and  week  104  of  the  study  showed  sustained 
inhibition  of  structural  damage  with  the  highest  protective  level  in  the  TCZ  8mg/kg  dose  group. 
Including data from withdrawal and post-escape patients instead of using linear extrapolation leads to 
an expected flattening of the mean change plot in the placebo population. 
The  examination  of  the  endpoint  measuring  improvement  of  physical  function  at  week  52  and  week 
104  of  the  study  showed  sustained  improvement  and  maintenance  of  3  years  with  the  highest 
improvement  level  in  the  TCZ  8mg/kg  dose  group.  The  presented  data  does  support  the  proposed 
SmPC wording. 
The presented data shows maintenance of reduction of signs and symptoms of RA during year one and 
two  of  the  long  term  studies.  Sustained  efficacy  could  be  assessed  with  all  used  instruments  of 
measuring  efficacy  as  ACR,  DAS28  and  EULAR  response.  Although  the  data  is  not  subject  of  the 
current variation it is still seen as supportive and positive. 
The  number  of  patients  developing  human  anti-human  antibodies  (HAHA)  is  considered  low  and  not 
increasing over treatment time. Even though  numbers are very small a trend is notable that patients 
developing neutralising antibodies experience a loss of efficacy  and tend to  withdraw from the study. 
So  the  judgement  from  the  initial  data  from  MAA  that  efficacy  was  not  impaired  in  patients  with 
neutralizing  HAHA,  is  not  fully  acceptable  any  more.  As  the  percentage  of  patients  developing 
antibodies  is  still  low,  no  further  consequences  need  to  be  taken  but  data  regarding  antibody 
development need to be kept in focus.  
3.3.3 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All  Exposure  Population:  this is the primary population for assessment of the long-term safety and 
tolerability  of  TCZ  and  includes  patients  from  studies  WA17822,  WA17823,  WA17824,  WA18062, 
WA18063  and  WP18663  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  TCZ,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they 
entered  long-term  extension  studies  WA18695  or  WA18696  or  continued  into  the  extension  phase  of 
study WA17823. This analysis pools data from the core studies (including the transition phase of study 
WA17824), and the WA17823, WA18695 and WA18696 extension studies where applicable (i.e., if the 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 22/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
patient has such data available). Up to the cut-off date, the 4009 patients included in this population 
provide a total of 8580 patients-years exposure to TCZ. Of the 4009 patients in this population, 3577 
received treatment for at least 6 months, 3296 received treatment for at least 1 year, 2806 received 
treatment for at least 2 years, and 1222 received treatment for at least 3 years. 
All Control Population: additional safety analyses were performed on this population to elucidate the 
effect  of  TCZ  dose  level  on  specific  AEs  and  laboratory  abnormalities  of  interest.  The  All  Control 
population  includes  all  patients  randomized  to  one  of  the  five  core  Phase  III  studies  (WA17822, 
WA17823  [2-year  core  period],  WA17824  [including  the  transition  phase],  WA18062  and  WA18063). 
Only data from the double-blind phases of each core study are included and data from the point that a 
patient  changes  treatment  regimen  are  excluded.  Change  in  treatment  regimen  includes:  entering 
escape therapy, changing TCZ dose, changing to open label TCZ. Safety data from study WP18663 are 
excluded. 
Under  controlled  conditions  in  the  Phase  III  studies,  1555  patients  received  control  treatment,  774 
patients  received  TCZ  4  mg/kg  and  1870  patients  received  TCZ  8  mg/kg.  Post-marketing  safety 
information is also provided up to a cut-off date of April 11, 2009  
In  the  first  year  of  study  WA17823,  the  total  patient-years  of  duration  on  trial  treatment,  defined  as 
the  time  from  initial  dose  of  study  medication  to  the  time  of  treatment  switch  for  patients  who 
increased their TCZ dose or to the time of the last safety observation for patients who did not change 
dose, was 256.13 year in the placebo + MTX group, 328.71 years in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group, 
and 349.15 year in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group. The additional year of treatment in the second year 
of the study primarily increased exposure to the TCZ 8 mg/kg dose reflecting both the high proportion 
of  patients  whose  only  dose  of  TCZ  was  8  mg/kg  and  the  high  proportion  of  patients  who  switched 
from the other regimens. Thus, by week 104, the highest total patient-years of treatment duration was 
in the pool of all patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg (1320.4 years). Patients whose only dose of TCZ 
was 4 mg/kg had the lowest total duration of treatment by week 104 (183.3 years), reflecting the high 
proportion of patients who switched to the higher dose.  
Considering cumulative exposure in the RA clinical trial program, 4,009 patients have received at least 
one dose of TCZ as of the clinical cut-off date (February 6, 2009), providing a total of 8579.7 patient-
years of exposure and 9414.3 patient-years of observation. Overall this represents a 3-fold increase in 
exposure to TCZ since the original application.

Figure 6 
Study WA17823 Safety Analysis Approach 
For the year 1 analysis, safety data were presented according to initially randomized treatment. Safety 
data obtained after initiation of escape therapy were censored and provided separately. Consequently, 
this  analysis  enables  a  between-group  comparison  and  thus  establishes  the  safety  profile  of  TCZ  4 
mg/kg  and  8  mg/kg  in  comparison  with  control.  However,  as  patients  were  expected  (per  the  study 
design)  to  switch  to  open  label  treatment  with  TCZ  8  mg/kg  in  the  second  year,  such  an  analysis 
approach for the cumulative analysis up to week 104 would have censored the majority of the year 2 
data, resulting in a minimal increase in exposure and safety data. 
The analysis at week 104 thus assessed patients on the basis of the treatment received rather than the 
treatment  to  which  they  were  originally  randomized,  an  approach  which  allowed  inclusion  of  not only 
the  new  safety  data  accrued  in  year  2  but  also  post-escape  safety  data  from  year  1  into  the  main 
analysis. As a consequence, the utility of between-group comparisons from the cumulative data up to 
week  104  is  limited  and  the  main  focus  of  the  dataset  is  on  the  assessment  of  long-term  safety  and 
the safety profile in patients who switched treatment regimens. 
Two  complementary  presentation  approaches  were  employed  for  the  cumulative  safety  data  up  to 
week 104, namely by treatment–switch groups and  by pooling all data on a particular regimen (e.g., 
all  data  from  patients  receiving  TCZ  4  mg/kg  including  those  originally  randomized  to  this  dose  and 
those randomized to placebo who entered escape therapy). 
Withdrawals – WA17823 
Of the 1190 randomized patients who received study treatment, a total of 281 withdrew prematurely 
from the study up to week 104. As described in the 1-year CSR, 170 patients withdrew during the first 
52  weeks  of  the  study:  128  patients  from  initial  randomized  treatment  (36  in  the  placebo  +  MTX 
group, 44 in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group and 48 in TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group), 37 patients from 
escape  1  therapy  (21  on TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  and  16  on  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX)  and  five  (5)  patients 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 24/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
from  escape  2  therapy.  Overall,  more  patients  withdrew  for  safety-related  reasons,  namely  AEs  or 
intercurrent  illness,  while  receiving  TCZ  treatment  than  while  receiving  placebo  treatment.  In  the 
cumulative  data  up  to  week  104,  premature  withdrawals  for  any  reason  are  disproportionately 
represented in the group of patients whose only dose of TCZ was 4 mg/kg as the study was designed 
to switch those patients remaining in the study to open label TCZ 8 mg/kg after week 52. Conversely, 
the  group  of  patients  who  switched  from  TCZ  4  mg/kg  to  8  mg/kg  had  a  lower  rate  of  such  events 
since, by definition, they did not discontinue on the 4 mg/kg dose. 
Withdrawals – Pooled Long-Term Data 
One thousand and sixty-four patients (1064) (27%) withdrew from the All Exposure population after at 
least  one  dose  of  TCZ  treatment  note,  this  includes  the  withdrawals  from  the  TCZ  +  MTX  groups  in 
study  WA17823  described  above).  Withdrawals  due  to  safety  and  non-safety  reasons  occurred  in  a 
similar  proportion  of  patients  (14%  and  13%,  respectively).  Five-hundred  and  eight  patients  (508) 
(12.7%) prematurely withdrew due to AEs/laboratory abnormalities. A total of 50 deaths were reported 
in  the  All  Exposure  population.  The  most  common  non-safety  reasons  for  early  withdrawal  were 
“refusal  of  treatment”  (223  patients,  5.6%),  and  “insufficient  therapeutic  response”  (152  patients, 
3.8%).  Other  non-safety  reasons  for  early  withdrawal  were  “other”  (74  patients,  1.8%),  “failed  to 
return” (58 patients, 1.4%), “other protocol violation” (6 patients), and “violation of selection criteria 
at entry” (4 patients). 
Adverse events 
In all studies, safety monitoring included the collection of information on adverse events (AEs), deaths, 
serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  reasons  for  withdrawals,  laboratory  tests,  vital  signs  and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs).  
WA17823 1-year Analysis 
During initial randomized treatment up to week 52, the proportion of patients with at least one AE was 
higher in each of the TCZ + MTX groups compared with the placebo + MTX group, the difference being 
mainly attributed to higher percentages of patients in the TCZ + MTX groups who experienced AEs in 
particular  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  including  infections  and  infestations,  GI  disorders,  skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  and  investigations  (most  of  which  were  related  to  events  of  liver 
function  test  abnormalities).  Differences  between  the  groups  in  extent  of  exposure  to  initial 
randomized treatment should also be taken into account when examining the prevalence of AEs across 
the  treatment  groups.  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  and  AEs  leading  to  dose  modification  all 
occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the TCZ + MTX groups than in the placebo + MTX group. 
Six patients died, one in the placebo + MTX group, one in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX (escape 1 therapy) 
group  and  four  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  group  (one  of  whom  was  on  TCZ  8  mg/kg  to  8  mg/kg 
escape 1 therapy). 
WA17823 2-year Analysis 
In  the  analysis  according  to  originally  randomized  treatment  group,  between-group  differences 
identified  during  year  1  were  retained,  although  direct  comparison  between  groups  in  the  cumulative 
data to week 104, particularly with placebo, is confounded by the fact that the additional data in this 
analysis were accrued primarily with TCZ 8 mg/kg in year 2. The placebo data thus remain unchanged 
from year 1. The  nature and frequency of AEs (including deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment 
withdrawal or dose modification) remained consistent with the profile documented in year 1, as shown 
by  analyses  of  the  cumulative  data  up  to  week  104  both  by  treatment  switch-groups  and  by  each 
regimen pooled. 
CHMP variation assessment report

Most  of  the  additional  safety  data  in  year  2  was  accrued  in  patients  whose  only  dose  of  TCZ  was  8 
mg/kg (i.e., patients initially randomized to this dose or who switched to open label treatment in year 
2). Comparison of this group with data obtained for the same dose group up to week 52 showed that 
the safety profile established in year 1 remained unchanged with increasing exposure to TCZ 8 mg/kg 
in year 2. 
The  second  largest  incremental  set  of  data  in  year  2  was  post-switch  data  obtained  in  patients  who 
increased their TCZ dose from 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. In this subset of patients, the incidence of AEs and 
laboratory  data  abnormalities  that  have  been  shown  to  be  TCZ  dose-dependent  increased  after  the 
switch to TCZ 8 mg/kg to more closely resemble rates observed for the higher dose. 
In the All Control population, a dose-dependent increase in the overall rate of AEs was observed in the 
TCZ 8 mg/kg group (381.6 per 100 patients-years) compared with the TCZ 4 mg/kg group (358.0 per 
100 patient-years). 
In  the  All  Control  population,  infections  were  the  most  frequently  reported  type  of  AEs.  Marked 
differences were observed between the TCZ treatment groups and control treatment group in the rate 
of AEs for the following SOCs: Skin and subcutaneous disorders, primarily driven by events of rash and 
pruritus;  Investigations;  primarily  driven  by  events  of 
increased 
transaminases 
including 
transaminases increased,  ALT increased,  hepatic enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal, AST 
increased, and ALT abnormal; Neoplasms, primarily driven by multiple events of single occurrence 
Minor  differences  were  observed  between  the  TCZ  treatment  groups  and  control  treatment  group  in 
the rate of AEs for the following SOCs: Infections and infestations, predominantly driven by events of 
upper  respiratory  tract  infections;  Vascular  system  disorders,  primarily  driven  by  hypertension;  Eye 
disorders,  primarily  driven  by  events  conjunctivitis;  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  primarily 
driven by events of neutropenia/leukopenia; Endocrine disorders, primarily driven by events of thyroid 
dysfunction 
Nervous  system  disorders,  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders,  renal  and  urinary  disorders,  and 
hepatobiliary  disorders  occurred  at  similar  rates  across  the  three  treatment  groups,  however,  the 
following events were reported more frequently in TCZ-treated patients compared with control-treated 
patients: Headache; Dizziness; Hypercholesterolemia; Nephrolithiasis; Hepatic steatosis 
In  the  All  Exposure  population,  the  overall  rate  of  AEs  was  332.2  per  100  patient-years,  which  is 
similar to the rate reported previously. 
The rate of AEs was highest in the first 6 months of treatment with TCZ and decreased thereafter. 
Adverse Events Considered to be related to Study Drug by the Investigator 
WA17823 
During initial randomized treatment up to week 52, AEs considered by the investigator to be related to 
treatment were reported by more patients in the TCZ + MTX groups (4 mg/kg, 50%; 8 mg/kg, 55%) 
than in the placebo + MTX group (40%), this difference being mainly attributed to greater numbers of 
patients  who  experienced  GI  disorders  or  abnormal  investigations  (mostly  elevations  in  hepatic 
enzymes) considered by the investigator to be related to TCZ + MTX treatment. A higher percentage of 
patients in the TCZ + MTX groups (4 mg/kg, 3% and 8 mg/kg, 4%) experienced SAEs (mostly serious 
infections  and  infestations)  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  trial  treatment  compared 
with patients in the placebo + MTX group (2%).  
In  the  cumulative  data  up  to  week  104,  there  was  no  increase  in  the  rate  of  AEs  considered  by  the 
investigator to be related to trial treatment either with prolonged exposure to TCZ 8 mg/kg or among 
CHMP variation assessment report

patients who increased their TCZ dose from 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. The types of AEs considered by the 
investigator to be related to trial treatment were consistent with those described up to week 52. 
Pooled Controlled and Long-Term Data 
In  the  All  Exposure  population,  the  rate  of  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
treatment  was  112.8  per  100  patient-years.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increased  risk  of  a  patient 
experiencing a treatment-related AE with continued exposure to TCZ. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAEs 
Serious Adverse Events – WA17823 
During initial randomized treatment up to week 52, a higher proportion of patients in the TCZ + MTX 
groups experienced SAEs compared with the placebo + MTX group. SAEs occurred most frequently in 
the following SOCs: infections (mainly pneumonia), injury and poisoning (primarily fractures of various 
types),  neoplasms,  GI  disorders,  nervous  system  disorders  and  cardiac  disorders.  Infections  and 
infestations, the most frequently reported SAEs, were observed in 2.5% of patients in the TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+ MTX group, 3.0% of patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group and 1.5% of patients in the placebo 
+  MTX  group.  Neoplasms  were  more  frequent  in  the  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  group  (2.5%)  than  in  the 
TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group (0.3%). 
SAE  rates  in  patients  on  escape  therapy  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  patients  during  initial 
randomized treatment. 
In the cumulative data up to week 104, the overall profile of SAEs was comparable to that reported up 
to  week  52,  with  no  changes  in  either  the  nature  or  the  rates  per  100  patient-years  with  prolonged 
exposure to TCZ 8 mg/kg. For patients who increased their dose of TCZ from 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg, the 
rate  of  SAEs  increased  after  the  treatment  switch  to  a  rate  comparable  with  that  for  patients  whose 
only dose of TCZ was 8 mg/kg (11.4 per 100 patient-years). 
Serious Adverse Events – Pooled Controlled and Long-Term Data 
In the All Control population, the rate of SAEs was similar across the three treatment groups (control, 
14.4  per  100  patient-years;  TCZ  4  mg/kg,  13.6  per  100  patient-years;  TCZ  8  mg/kg,  14.5  per  100 
patient-years).  The  most  frequently  reported  type  of  SAEs  were  infections  and  infestations  which 
occurred  at  a  higher  rate  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  group  (4.8  per  100  patient-years)  compared  with  the 
TCZ  4  mg/kg  and  control  treatment  groups  (3.5  and  3.3  per  100  patient-years,  respectively).  The 
frequency of SAEs in other SOCs was comparable between patients treated with TCZ and patients who 
received control treatment.  
In the All Exposure population, the rate of SAEs was 14.9 per 100 patient-years, which is similar to the 
rate reported previously. There was no evidence of an increased risk of SAEs with prolonged exposure 
to TCZ, as demonstrated by the similar rates of SAEs per 100 patient-years by 6 monthly intervals of 
exposure. 
The most frequently reported type of SAEs was infections and infestations (4.4 per 100 patient-years), 
of  which  pneumonia  (0.8  per  100  patient-years)  and  cellulitis  (0.5  per  100  patient-years)  were  the 
most  common.  The  second  most  frequently  reported  type  of  SAEs  was  injury,  poisoning,  and 
procedural  complications  (1.3  per  100  patient-years),  with  various  types  of  fractures  contributing  to 
the majority of the events reported in this SOC.  
CHMP variation assessment report

When  comparing  the  rates  of  SAEs  by  SOC  and  the  rates  of  individual  events  that  led  to  treatment 
withdrawal,  only  a  fraction  of  SAEs  led  to  patient  withdrawal,  except  for  malignancies  and  individual 
events that led to death (primarily fatal infections and cardiac events). 
Analysis of Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal – WA17823 
During  initial  randomized  treatment  up  to  week  52,  7.3%  and  8.5%  of  patients  in  the  TCZ  +  MTX 
groups (4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, respectively), experienced AEs and laboratory abnormalities that led to 
premature  withdrawal  compared  with  2.6%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  +  MTX  group.  Elevations  in 
hepatic  enzymes(i.e.,  increased  transaminases,  increased  ALT,  increased  bilirubin,  increased  hepatic 
enzymes), the most common AE leading to withdrawal, were more frequent in the TCZ + MTX groups 
(4 mg/kg + MTX, 1.8% and 8 mg/kg + MTX, 4.5%) compared with the placebo + MTX group (0.3%); 
this  reflected  per-protocol  requirements  to  withdraw  patients  with  either  ALT/AST  values  >  5x  ULN, 
indirect  bilirubin  >  2x  ULN,  or  total  bilirubin  >  43  µmol/L.  Serious  infections  led  to  premature 
withdrawal in four (4) patients (1%) in each of the TCZ + MTX dose groups and one patient (0.3%) in 
the  placebo  +  MTX  group.  Six  patients  (1.5%),  all  in  the  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  group,  withdrew 
prematurely  due  to  neoplasms.  The  remaining  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  were  individual  AEs  in 
different  SOCs.  Among  patients  who  experienced  AEs  that  led  to  premature  withdrawal,  64%  in  the 
TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group and 69% in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group did so within the first 6 months, 
compared with 56% in the placebo + MTX group. During escape therapy up to week 52, a total of 13 
patients (2.1% to 5.5%) experienced AEs that led to premature trial treatment withdrawal, the most 
common of which  were anaphylactic shock/reaction (3 patients) and drug hypersensitivity (1 patient) 
in the MTX to TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX escape group. In the cumulative data up to week 104, the overall 
profile of AEs leading to premature trial treatment withdrawal was comparable to that reported up to 
week  52,  with  no  changes  in  either  the  nature  or  the  rates  per  100  patient-years  with  prolonged 
exposure to TCZ 8 mg/kg. By definition, patients who switched from TCZ 4 mg/kg to TCZ 8 mg/kg did 
not  withdraw  prematurely  from  the  lower  dose.  After  the  switch  to  TCZ  8  mg/kg,  the  rate  of  AEs 
leading  to  withdrawal  (7.4  per  100  patient-years)  was  consistent  with  that  for  patients  whose  only 
dose of TCZ was 8 mg/kg (7.3 per 100 patient-years). 
Analysis of Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal – Pooled Controlled and Long-Term Data 
In  the  All  Control  population,  the  rate  of  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  was  6.9  per  100  patient-years  in 
the control group compared with 10.1 and 10.2 per 100 patient-years in the TCZ 4 mg/kg and TCZ 8 
mg/kg groups, respectively. The types of events leading to withdrawal differed in the three treatment 
groups,  with  infections  being  the  most  common  in  the  control  group  and  investigation  AEs,  primarily 
liver  function  test  abnormalities,  being  the  most  common  in  the  TCZ  treatment  groups.  In  the  All 
Exposure population, the rate of AEs leading to withdrawal was 5.8 per 100 patient-years. The overall 
rate of AEs leading to withdrawal was highest (11.5 per 100 patient-years) during the first 6 months of 
treatment  and  steadily  decreased  thereafter.  The  majority  of  events  resolved  after  withdrawal  of  the 
patient. 
The  most  frequently  reported  types  of  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  were  investigations  (1.3  per  100 
patient-years,  primarily  due  to  events of  liver  function  test  abnormalities),  infections  and  infestations 
(1.1  per  100  patient-years),  and  neoplasms  (benign,  malignant,  or  unspecified;  0.7  per  100  patient-
years). 
Infection Adverse Events 
In  the  All  Control  population,  the  overall  rate  of  infections  was  95.9  per  100  patient  years  for  the 
control  group,  101.8  per  100  patient-years  for  the  TCZ  4  mg/kg  group,  and  102.3  per  100  patient-
years  for  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  group.  Upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (e.g.,  upper  respiratory  tract 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 28/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
infections, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, influenza, and sinusitis) and urinary tract infections were most 
commonly reported.  
The overall rate of infections reported in the All Exposure population was 108.0 per 100 patient-years 
of  exposure.  The  rate  of  infections  was  highest  in  the  first  6  months  and  decreased  thereafter.  The 
overall  profile  of  infections  was  consistent  with  data  reported  previously  with  upper  respiratory  tract 
(e.g.,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  nasopharyngitis,  and  bronchitis)  and  urinary  tract  infections 
being most commonly reported. 
Serious Infections 
In  the  All  Control  population,  the  overall  rate  of serious  infections  was  3.4  per  100  patient-years  for 
the control group, 3.5 per 100 patient-years for the TCZ 4 mg/kg group, and 4.9 per 100 patient-years 
for  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  group.  The  events  most  commonly  reported  were  pneumonia,  cellulitis,  urinary 
tract  infection,  and  gastroenteritis.  In  the  All  Exposure  population,  the  rate  of  serious  infections  was 
4.66 per 100 patient-years, which is similar to the rate of serious infections reported previously and to 
that reported in the literature for other biologics.  
The most commonly observed serious infections in patients treated with TCZ were pneumonia and skin 
and soft tissue infections. 
Opportunistic Infections 
In the All Exposure population, a total of 22 opportunistic infections were reported in 20 patients. The 
current  rate  of  opportunistic  infections  is  0.2  per  100  patient-years.  Fourteen  (14)  of  the  22 
opportunistic  infections  were  serious.  Of  the  22  opportunistic  infections,  two  (9%)  led  to  a  fatal 
outcome, nine (41%) (including the two deaths) led to discontinuation from treatment with TCZ, and 
five  (23%)  led  to  TCZ  dose  modification.  One  patient  with  systemic  candida  also  had  concomitant 
staphylococcal sepsis which, in the investigator’s opinion, was the cause of death. 
Cumulatively, nine (9) events of tuberculosis (TB), eight (8) pulmonary and one (1) extra-pulmonary, 
and one (1) mycobacterium urinary tract infection (acid-alcohol resistant bacillus; BAAR positive) were 
reported in the All Exposure population.  
Deaths 
There were a total of nine (9) deaths in TCZ-treated patients up to week 104; four (4) were reported 
during  year  2.  All  but  one  patient,  who  was  receiving  TCZ  4  mg/kg  +  MTX,  were  receiving  TCZ  8 
mg/kg + MTX. The deaths were due to pulmonary embolism (TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX), gastroesophageal 
cancer,  metastatic  malignant  melanoma,  metastatic  lung  adenocarcinoma,  cardiomyopathy,  cerebral 
haemorrhage, gastrointestinal infection, bronchopneumonia, and sepsis. 
Overall Summary of Deaths – Pooled Controlled and Long-Term Data 
In  the  All  Exposure  population,  a  total  of  50  deaths  have  been  reported  in  patients  who  received  at 
least one dose of TCZ. 
The  principle  causes  of  death  as  reported  by  the  investigators  include  cardiac  events  (13  cases), 
serious infections (12 cases), and malignancies (8  cases). Serious infections  were ongoing in  five (5) 
patients  at  the  time  of  death,  however,  the  investigator  did  not  judge  the  infections  as  the  primary 
cause of death. 
In TCZ-treated patients, the overall rate of death is 0.53 per 100 patient-years of exposure, which is 
consistent  with  the  previously  reported  rate.  In  comparison,  the  overall  rate  of  death  for  patients  on 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 29/37
 
 
   
 
 
 
control therapy is 0.73 per 100 patient-years (6 deaths in 824.56 patient-years exposure). Of the 50 
deaths reported in patients treated with TCZ, one occurred in a patient receiving TCZ 4 mg/kg and 49 
occurred in patients receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg (resulting in rates of 0.97 and 0.53 deaths per 100 patient-
years, respectively). The overall rate of death due to infection as judged by the investigator is 0.13 per 
100 patient-years of exposure, which is also consistent with the rate reported previously. 
Laboratory findings 
Anti-TCZ antibodies  
The development of anti-TCZ antibodies was low, with about 1.0% of patients developing confirmation 
assay positive specific anti-TCZ antibodies and 3% developing neutralizing antibodies. The majority of 
patients who developed specific or neutralizing antibodies did so by week 24. The development of anti-
TCZ antibodies had no apparent effect on the frequency or type of AEs reported. Only eight (8) of 3937 
patients  (0.2%)  experienced  a  clinically  significant  infusion  reaction  in  association  with  anti-TCZ 
antibodies. In addition, among patients who missed ≥ 2 consecutive infusions, there did not appear to 
be significant production of specific or neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies.  
Neutropenia 
Clinically significant neutropenia was observed infrequently in patients receiving TCZ and there was no 
apparent association between decreases in neutrophil counts and the nature or frequency of infections; 
however, the MAH recommends caution when considering initiation of TCZ treatment in patients with a 
low neutrophil count and. In patients with an absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 109/L, treatment is not 
recommended.  No  effects  on  bone  marrow  or  neutrophil  function  have  been  reported  with  TCZ  in 
animal studies. 
Change in transaminase levels 
Transient mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been observed commonly with 
TCZ  treatment,  particularly  when  TCZ  is  administered  in  combination  with  DMARDs  (mainly  MTX). 
Although these elevations have not been treatment limiting in the vast majority of patients and have 
been observed without progression to hepatic injury, the MAH recommends caution when considering 
treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment. Data indicate that treatment 
can  be  successfully  resumed  without  recurrence  of  elevations  following  decrease  of  hepatic 
transaminases.  
Change in lipid levels 
Initiation of TCZ is associated with elevation of total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides. Absence 
of  findings  from  non-clinical  and  healthy  volunteer  studies  conducted  with  TCZ  at  a  range  of  doses, 
combined  with  the  observation  that  lipid  parameter  elevations  have  also  been  reported  with  other 
biological  RA  therapies,  provide  initial  evidence  that  these  elevations  may  occur  as  a  result  of  a 
reduction in chronic inflammation rather than a direct effect of TCZ on lipid metabolism. There was no 
evidence to suggest that changes in the lipid profile were associated with clinical manifestations such 
as  cardiovascular  adverse  events.  There  were  also  profound  reductions  in  CRP,  high  levels  of  which 
represent a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. In the small number of patients who had an 
adverse change in lipid profile, based on lipid elevations alone, initiation of treatment with a statin was 
effective. 
Safety in special populations 
Subpopulation  analyses  of  the  five  core  Phase  III  studies  at  24  weeks  did  not  identify  any  notable 
differences across demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, region, race, weight and BMI, and 
renal function (mild renal impairment). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 30/37
 
 
   
 
 
Further  exploration  of  safety  in  subpopulations  was  performed  for  certain  parameters  at  1  year  in 
study  WA17823  and,  for  infection  AEs  in  particular,  in  the  pooled  controlled  and  long-term  safety 
populations.  
In summary, serious infections occurred at a higher rate in the following subpopulations of TCZ-treated 
patients:  patients  >  65  years  of  age,  patients  in  the  higher  weight  and  highest  and  lowest  BMI 
categories,  patients  with  prior  co-morbidities  that  predispose  them  to  infections  (diabetes,  chronic 
pulmonary  disease),  patients  who  previously  received  anti-TNFs  and  patients  taking  background 
corticosteroids; the highest rates were generally observed in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group. 
Control-treated patients showed similar trends for increases in serious infections by age, BMI, prior co-
morbidities and prior anti-TNF use. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The  data  suggest  that  there  are  no  additional  significant  safety  issues  after  extended  treatment  with 
RoActemra  and  risk  minimisation  strategies  exist  and  are  detailed  within  the  risk  management  plan, 
product information and within clinical guidelines. 
Patients  showed  a  higher  rate  of  treatment  related  SAE,  AE  leading  to  withdrawal  and  AE  leading  to 
dose  interruption  on  the  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  dosing  schedule  compared  to  the  4  mg/kg  +  MTX  dosing 
schedule. Patients on escape therapy portrayed similar range and intensity of side effects as the TCZ + 
MTX 8mg/kg group.  
The terms “Urticaria” and “Peripheral oedema” are integrated in the tabular overview of AEs in the SPC 
to  reflect  the  above  described  findings.  The  terms  “Nephrolithiasis”  and  “Hypothyroidism”  are 
integrated as uncommon AEs in the tabular overview of AEs in the SPC to reflect the above described 
findings. 
Most of the safety data in year 2 was accrued in patients whose only dose of TCZ was 8 mg/kg (i.e., 
patients  initially  randomized  to  this  dose  or  who  switched  to  open  label  treatment  in  year  2).  The 
safety profile of study year 1 does not change significantly with increasing exposure to TCZ 8 mg/kg in 
year 2. 
Overall  the  presented  data  shows  that  the  safety  profile  or  RoActemra  remains  relatively  stable  over 
longer treatment periods and that the highest incidence of adverse events are experienced in the first 
6 month of treatment.  
The  increased  rate  of  GI  disorders  was  recently  assessed  in  the  II/005  variation  (positive  opinion 
adopted  in  October  2009)  and  the  SmPC  was  reworded.  Elevation  of  hepatic  enzymes  was  already 
found to be an adverse event of special interest during initial assessment for MAA. Warning statements 
are already implemented in the SPC and PIL and are seen as sufficient. 
SAEs  most  frequently  were  the  following:  infections  (mainly  pneumonia),  injury  and  poisoning 
(primarily fractures of various types), neoplasms, GI disorders, nervous system disorders and cardiac 
disorders.  Infections  and  infestations,  the  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  occurred  more  frequent  in 
the higher dose group. Neoplasms were more frequent in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group (2.5%) than 
in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group (0.3%). 
The  rates  of  death  remain  unchanged  compared  to  the  previous  evaluation.  Further  assessment  of 
immunogenicity  remains  important  and  is  addressed  in  the  context  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  As 
part  of  the  MAA  the  performance  of  the  assay  was  discussed.  A  poor  performance  of  the  anti-drug 
antibody assay could easily explain the finding that infusion reactions are not associated with anti-TCZ 
antibodies.

The overall profile of infections was consistent with data reported previously. Most commonly reported 
were upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infections.

3.4 Pharmacovigilance aspects 
Risk Management Plan 
The MAH has submitted an updated RMP (version 7.0) with this Type II variation application. The latest 
version of the RMP has been updated in August 2009 (RMP version 5.0) to include a more appropriate 
wording with regard to GI perforations and agreed that these are useful and necessary changes.  
Since submission of the last EU RMP, several changes have been made to the Core Data Sheet (CDS 
version 2 and CDS version 3) based on the cumulative safety data through 6 February 2009 from the 
TCZ safety database for ongoing studies in RA. The new safety information added to the CDS included 
the  update  of  Warnings  and  Precautions  section  to  include  information  on  viral  reactivation  reported 
with RA biologic therapies. Section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated accordingly and reads as follows: 
“Viral  reactivation  (e.g.  hepatitis  B  virus)  has  been  reported  with  biologic  therapies  for  rheumatoid 
arthritis.  In  clinical  studies  with  tocilizumab,  patients  who  screened  positive  for  hepatitis  were 
excluded”. This change is endorsed by the CHMP. 
Below, a list of all ongoing safety concerns is presented.

3.4 Benefit Risk Assessment 
The MAH has provided sufficient data to support the proposed changes to the SPC, especially to include 
a  statement  in  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC  that  RoActemra  has  been  shown  to  slow  progression  of  joint 
damage and to improve physical function.  
The  MAH  was  asked  to  change  Section  4.1  of  the  SmPC  from  “RoActemra  has  been  shown  to  inhibit 
progression  of  joint  damage….”  to  “RoActemra  has  been  shown  to reduce  the  rate  of  progression  of 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 35/37
 
 
   
 
 
joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function when given in combination with 
methotrexate.” 
This statement is based on one and 2 year x-ray data assessment, assessment of the change in HAQ-
DL  and  facilitated  by  other  patient  reported  outcomes  as  FACIT-fatigue  and  SF-36  physical  function 
scores.  Treatment  with  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  MTX  resulted  in  a  74%  inhibition  of  progression  of  joint 
damage  compared  to  placebo  +  MTX,  as  indicated  by  the  mean  change  in  total  Sharp-Genant  score 
from baseline to week 52. This inhibition was maintained (≥ 81%, from baseline) to week 104. 
Patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX had a significant improvement in physical function at week 
52  compared  with  placebo  +  MTX,  as  indicated  by  the  AUC  of  the  change  in  HAQ-DI,  and  this  was 
maintained until week 104.  
Treatment effects in signs and symptoms achieved at year 1 following treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX were maintained (ACR50 and 70 responses) or showed further improvement (tender and swollen 
joint  counts)  at  year  2.  Response  rates  to  therapy  with  TCZ  8  mg/kg  (with  or  without  concomitant 
DMARD)  were  maintained  or  improved  with  duration  of  treatment  (ACR50,  ACR70  and  DAS28 
remission) over time. 
In  the  MAA,  identified  risks  with  TCZ  treatment  were  serious  infections  (including  opportunistic 
infections  and  infections  with  possibly  fatal  outcome),  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions,  and 
complications  of  diverticulitis,  including  lower  gastrointestinal  perforation.  Potential  risks  with  TCZ 
treatment  were  identified  with  regard  to  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  elevations  in  hepatic 
transaminases and lipid parameters, and immunogenicity. 
The  overall  rate  of  serious  infections  in  TCZ-treated  patients  (4.66  per  100  patient-years)  and  the 
highest  rates  observed  in  the  All  Control  population  (TCZ  8  mg/kg,  4.9  per  100  patient-years)  were 
both  within  the  rates  reported  in  the  literature  for  other  biologic  treatments  for  RA  (5.32  per  100 
patient-years.  The  serious  infection  rate  remained  stable  over  time  and  the  pattern  of  serious 
infections was consistent with that reported previously. 
Serious infections occurred at a higher rate in patients > 65 years of age, patients in the higher weight 
and  highest  and  lowest  BMI  categories,  patients  with  prior  co-morbidities  that  predispose  them  to 
infections  (diabetes,  chronic  pulmonary  disease),  patients  who  previously  received  anti-TNFs  and 
patients taking background corticosteroids; the highest rates were observed in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group. 
In general Tocilizumab was well tolerated and the safety aspects were comprehensively characterised 
by the MAH. Given the nature of RA and the treatments available this product has an adequate safety 
profile with no reasons for concerns so far over a treatment period of longer than 2 years. 
Overall,  adverse  effects  associated  with  the  mechanism  of  IL-6R  inhibition  (increased  infections, 
neutropenia)  were  observed  in  all  TCZ  treatment  groups.  Additional  safety  aspects  (gastrointestinal 
disorders,  skin  disorders,  increases  of  hepatic  transaminases,  platelet  decreases,  increases  in  lipids) 
show  a  slight  higher  proportion  in  the  8mg/kg  dosing  regimen  compared  to  the  4  mg/kg  regimen. 
These aspects are adequately addressed in the proposed SmPC. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion  that  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were 
needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.  
The following additional risk minimisation activity was required:  The MAH will conduct study ML25243 
to elucidate mechanism of reductions in neutrophil count.

2.  Conclusion 
On  22  April  2010  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Annex IIIB.

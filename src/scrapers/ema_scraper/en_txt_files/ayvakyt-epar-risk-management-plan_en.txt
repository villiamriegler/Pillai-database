PART II: Safety Specification 
PART II: Module SI- Epidemiology of Indication and Target Population 
SI.1 
Unresectable or Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour 
GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumours, probably arising from the precursors of 
the  interstitial  tissue  cells  of  Cajal  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  [1,  2].  GISTs  represent 
approximately 0.1%-0.3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies [3]. 
Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs [4]. These 
mutations  lead to  continuous  activation  of  tyrosine kinases, leading to cell  proliferation and 
inhibition of apoptosis. 
Most cases of GIST (75%) harbour a mutation in KIT in exon 11 (90%), exon 9 (8%), and less 
frequently in exon 13 (1%) and exon 17 (1%). Disease progression during treatment with TKIs 
is  often  associated  with  development  of  new  mutations,  with  an  increasing  prevalence  of 
mutations in exon 17 of KIT to approximately 95%-99% following a second-line TKI therapy 
[5-8]. 
PDGFRA  gene  mutations  represent  approximately  10%-20%  of  GISTs  [5-10].  The  most 
common  mutation  of  PDGFRA  occurs  in  exon  18  which  leads  to  a  mutant  PDGFRA  with 
valine (V) substituting for an aspartic acid  (D) at  position 842  (D842V mutation); however, 
mutations may also occur in exons 12 and 14 [7-10]. 
Approximately 10% of adult GISTs (and about 85% of paediatric cases) are not associated with 
KIT or PDGFRA mutations and stromal tumours do not harbour  any known gene mutations 
(these cases are known as “wild-type” tumours) [8, 11-13]. 
Incidence: 
The estimated age-standardised annual GIST incidence ranged from 0.1 per 100,000, based on 
a study combining data from 64 European cancer registries [14], to 1.94 per 100,000, based on 
a nationwide pathology registry study conducted in the Netherlands [15]. 
Based  on  the  most  recent  data,  the  estimated  worldwide  incidence  of  GISTs  is 
1.0 per 100,000 population [16, 17]. About 85% of GISTs, depending on the source of data, 
have a KIT (~75% of cases), or PDGFRA (~10% of cases) mutation which drive tumour growth 
[5-10]. 
Prevalence: 
The most recent estimated prevalence of GISTs in Europe is 28.0 cases per 100,000 population 
[15, 16]. This estimate is higher than other literature estimates, which may be explained by the 
source  of  the  data,  representing  a  nationwide  pathology  registry  study  conducted  in  the 
Netherlands.  This  registry  study  included  all  GISTs,  regardless  of  malignancy  type  and/or 
tumour size. 
Previous European estimates ranged from 8.0 per 100,000 in Norway [18] to 12.9 per 100,000 
in Sweden [19] and 15.0 per 100,000 population in the United Kingdom [20]. 
Demographics  of  the  Population  in  the  proposed  Indication  and  Risk  Factors  for  the 
Disease: 
GIST is most commonly diagnosed between 50 and 80 years of age with the median age of 
patients  being  about  60-65 years  [9,  21].  In  the  GIST  natural  history  study  conducted 
Page 11 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
retrospectively in Italy on 929 imatinib-naïve patients diagnosed with GIST between 1980 and 
2000 [2], the age of the patients ranged from 12 to 95 years, with the median of 66 years. 
Less  than  1%  of  GISTs  occur  in  the  paediatric  population.  Paediatric  GIST  mainly  affects 
females at or under the age of 16 years [3]. 
In the natural history study conducted by Blueprint in the United States (US) in patients with a 
D842V  mutation  in  PDGFRA,  diagnosed  between  01 January 2000  and  01 July 2016 
(Study BLU-285-1002),  most  patients  were  males  (68%),  with  a  median  age  at  the  time  of 
diagnosis of 57 years (ranging from 31 to 72 years) [8]. This is consistent with the epidemiology 
of GIST reported in other studies conducted in the US and Europe [2, 22]. 
Main existing Treatment Options:  
Prior to the initial marketing approval of avapritinib, unresectable PDGFRA D842V mutant-
driven  GIST  represented  a  high  unmet  medical  need  as  there  were  no  approved  therapies 
specifically targeting this mutation [12, 17, 23]. PDGFRA D842V mutations are insensitive to 
imatinib treatment as well as the other available treatment regimens for GIST [3, 12, 24-26]. 
Due to the lack of effective treatment options at the time, patients had a poor prognosis with 
the median progression free-survival (PFS) of only 3 to 5 months, and the overall survival of 
15 months  after  diagnosis  [24,  26].  In  refractory  KIT  mutant-driven  GIST,  PFS  with  best 
supportive care  (BSC),  after failure  of  available therapies,  is  approximately 0.9 months  [27, 
28]. 
Surgery  is  the  standard  primary  treatment  option  for  patients  with  localised  GIST  and  can 
provide  long-term  disease  control  [17].  However,  surgery  is  not  recommended  for  locally 
recurrent  or  metastatic  GISTs,  which  also  respond  poorly  to  conventional  therapies  such  as 
chemotherapy (e.g., doxorubicin, ifosfamide) [29] and radiation therapy [30]. Thus, targeted 
therapy  with  TKIs  has  emerged  as  the  standard  treatment  for  advanced  disease,  including 
imatinib as the first-line, sunitinib as the second-line and regorafenib as the third-line therapy 
[17]. Despite these advances with the introduction of TKIs, the majority of patients develop 
resistance over time which is mainly driven by the acquisition of a secondary mutation in the 
activation loop of KIT [17]. 
Imatinib is the standard first-line treatment for locally advanced inoperable and/or metastatic 
GIST [7, 9, 10]. Current European guidelines (i.e., Clinical Practice Guidelines of the European 
Society  for  Medical  Oncology  and  the  European  Network  for  Rare  Adult  Solid  Cancer  on 
Gastrointestinal  Stromal  Tumours)  recommend  that  imatinib  should  be  considered  as  the 
treatment of choice, even for KIT exon 9 mutated GIST [17]. 
Sunitinib  is  the  standard  second-line  therapy  for  unresectable  and/or  metastatic  GIST,  and 
treatment is routinely initiated upon lack of response to imatinib therapy [17]. Sunitinib and the 
third-line  therapy  regorafenib  offer  limited  sustained  disease  control,  with  the  median  PFS 
ranging from 5 to 6 months and overall response rates (ORRs) ranging from 4% to 7% [27, 31]. 
An analysis of patient registry data and post-marketing prescription information collected from 
patients  with  GIST  receiving  treatment  for  metastatic  disease  [32]  showed  that  only  about 
50% of  these  patients  receive  a  second-line  treatment.  While  the  first-line  treatment  with 
imatinib is  used in about  85% of patients seeking first-line treatment  for  metastatic disease, 
sunitinib  is  utilised  in  the  second-line  setting  only  in  approximately  50% of  patients  and 
approximately 15% of patients still receive imatinib at different doses in the second-line setting. 
In the third-line setting, regorafenib is used in approximately 45% of patients. These real-world 
data indicate that although sunitinib and regorafenib are approved for second- and third-line 
treatment, respectively,  neither is  used in the majority of patients,  and there is  no  dominant 
Page 12

standard of care or preferred treatment regimen after first-line therapy with imatinib [32]. This 
is consistent with the low response rates and short PFS seen with these agents. 
Natural History  of the Indicated Condition  in the Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity:  
The malignant potential of GISTs varies greatly from indolent tumours to rapidly progressing 
cancers [8]. A retrospective natural history study of GIST conducted in Italy showed that 59.7% 
of patients were diagnosed with gastric tumours, 26.3% with ileal/jejunal tumours, 3.4% with 
rectal  tumours,  3.1%  with  duodenal  tumours,  and  3.1%  with  peritoneal  tumours  (including 
mesenteric, omental, pelvic, and abdominal wall GIST tumours). The status of the disease at 
diagnosis  was  localised  in  88%  of  patients  and  metastatic  in  12%  of  patients  [2].  Study 
BLU-285-1002 showed that the primary tumour location was in the stomach in 68% of patients 
[8]. A US retrospective population-based epidemiological study showed similar results with the 
most common tumour sites involving the stomach (55% of cases) and small intestine (29% of 
cases) [22]. 
Studies  have  reported  that  up  to  20%  of  patients  with  GIST  have  metastases.  GIST  usually 
metastasises  within the abdominal cavity, affecting mostly the liver or  peritoneum [1].  Less 
common metastatic sites are in the gastrointestinal tract, including the oesophagus and stomach, 
lymph nodes, or reproductive or renal systems [2]. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases 
are  extremely  rare  in  patients  with  GIST  [1].  In  the  natural  history  Study  BLU-285-1002, 
metastases occurred predominantly in the peritoneum in 9% of patients receiving the first-line 
therapy, 17% of patients receiving the second-line therapy, and 33% of patients receiving the 
third-line therapy [8]. Peritoneal and/or liver metastases may occur even after complete excision 
of the tumour. 
Mortality rates for GIST differ based on existing co-morbidities and risk factors associated with 
them. Patients with localised GIST and no additional cancers, such as sporadic patients with 
GIST, were shown to be at increased risk of synchronous or metachronous malignancies [22], 
with the 5-year mortality rate being estimated at 12.9 % [33]. The mortality rate is three times 
higher in patients with concomitant regionally advanced or metastatic GIST [33]. 
In natural history Study BLU-285-1002, the overall study population included 22 patients, all 
of whom had previously received at least first-line therapy. Nineteen (86%) of these patients 
had also received second-line therapy and 16 (73%) had also received third-line therapy. Out 
of the 22 patients, only 1 achieved a complete response after first-line therapy with imatinib. 
No other responses (complete or partial response) were reported following the first-, second- or 
third-line therapies. The ORR for first-line therapy was 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.1–22.8).  The  median  PFS  was  5.6 months  (95%  CI:  3.1–16.2)  with  first-line  therapy, 
2.6 months  (95%  CI:  1.4–5.9)  with  second-line  therapy  and  5.6 months  (95%  CI:  2.1–11.5) 
with third-line therapy. The median overall survival was 44.5 months (95% CI: 20.4–69.6) with 
first-line therapy, 28.1 months (95% CI: 12.6–56.7) with second-line therapy, and 25.5 months 
(95% CI: 10.5-55.0) with third-line therapy [8]. Similar ORRs were calculated for patients who 
received first-line treatment in other published studies [24, 26, 34]; in these studies, none of the 
patients achieved an objective response to treatment following second- and third-line treatment 
(refer  to  Table 1).  These  trends  are  consistent  with  the  real-world  experience  showing  that 
median overall survival in patients with metastatic disease decreases quickly with multiple lines 
of  therapy  from  7  to  8 years  after  starting  initial  treatment  for  metastatic  disease  to  only 
1.4 years after starting treatment with fourth line of therapy [32].

The epidemiological studies on the US population concluded that Black race, older age, and 
advanced  stage  of  the  disease  were  associated  with  worse  disease  prognoses  [22,  35].  The 
characteristics  of  paediatric  GIST  differ  from  that  of  GIST  in  adult  patients  in  respect  to 
morphology, prognosis and pathology, as KIT or PDGFRA mutations are not commonly seen 
in this population [3]. Rare cases of familial GIST were reported in the literature associated 
with autosomal dominant transmission of germline KIT or PDGFRA mutation [30]. 
Important Co-Morbidities: 
GIST  is  predominantly  diagnosed  in  patients  older  than  60 years  of  age  [9].  As  such, 
comorbidities are common and may include conditions commonly seen in this population such 
as heart disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and arthritis. 
A natural  history study of GIST conducted in  Italy showed  that 61%  of  patients  with  GIST 
reported other significant diseases. Malignancies other than GIST occurred in 28% of patients 
with  GIST  at  any  point  in  time  and  were  concomitant  with  GIST  in  15.8%  of  cases  (most 
commonly colorectal or gastric carcinoma) [2].  
A US population-based study on 6,112 patients with GIST showed that malignancies occurring 
with  significantly  increased  incidence  both  before  and  after  GIST  diagnoses  included  other 
sarcomas,  neuroendocrine-carcinoid  tumours,  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  and  colorectal 
adenocarcinoma.  Oesophageal  adenocarcinoma,  bladder  adenocarcinoma,  melanoma,  and 
prostate adenocarcinoma were significantly more common before the GIST diagnosis. Ovarian 
carcinoma,  small  intestine  adenocarcinoma,  papillary  thyroid  cancer,  renal  cell  carcinoma, 
hepatobiliary  adenocarcinoma,  gastric  adenocarcinoma,  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma,  uterine 
adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were 
significantly more common than the background rates after the GIST diagnosis [22]. 
Among concomitant non-malignant conditions, the most frequent diseases were gastrointestinal 
disorders (7.8%), such as duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, intestinal obstruction, and Crohn’s 
disease [2].

SI.2 
Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis 
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a clonal mast cell (MC) neoplasm, primarily driven by MCs 
carrying the KIT D816V mutation that results in constitutive, ligand-independent activation of 
the receptor tyrosine kinase. This causes proliferation, infiltration, and abnormal activation of 
MCs, leading to debilitating MC-mediated symptoms, and in a subset of patients, organ damage 
and poor survival [36, 37]. SM can be broadly divided into non-advanced and AdvSM, the latter 
encompassing a group of high-risk subtypes with a poor prognosis, including ASM, SM-AHN, 
and MCL [38]. SM-AHN accounts for approximately 75% of patients diagnosed with AdvSM 
[39]. 
Patients  with  both  non-advanced  and  AdvSM  suffer  from  a  wide  variety  of  severe  and 
unpredictable  symptoms  and  reduced  quality  of  life  with  limited  treatment  options.  Low 
awareness of SM results in suboptimal patient care and a highly unmet medical need in this 
population. Although heterogeneity characterises the clinical presentation and prognosis of SM, 
~95% of all SM cases are driven by the activating KIT D816V mutation, regardless of a subtype 
[40, 41]. 
Among SM patients, the majority (95%) are considered to have non-AdvSM, which primarily 
includes the World Health Organization variant of ISM and a small number of patients with 
smoldering SM (SSM) [42]. ISM patients have minimal signs of organ infiltration and have a 
generally  normal  life  expectancy;  however,  they  often  suffer  from  severe,  or  even  life 
threatening,  mediator  symptoms  and  a  poor  quality  of  life.  Importantly,  ISM  patients  can 
progress to more serious forms, including SSM and AdvSM [36, 43]. 
In  addition  to  severe  mediator  symptoms,  patients  with  any  of  the  AdvSM  subtypes 
characteristically experience organ damage from MC infiltration and have adverse pathological 
features that are associated with poor overall survival [42]. Organ systems typically involved 
(and associated findings) are bone marrow (marked cytopenia), liver (hepatomegaly, ascites, 
increased liver enzymes), bones (osteolysis, pathologic fractures), and the gastrointestinal tract 
(malabsorption, weight loss) [44]. 
Incidence: 
The estimated annual incidence rate of SM in the EU is 0.2 to 0.9 cases per 100,000 population 
[45, 46]. 
In a retrospective cohort study of 548 adults with SM diagnosed from 1997–2010 constructed 
using linked Danish national health registries, the incidence rate for all SM types was 0.9 per 
100,000 per year [45]. The most common subtype was ISM (450 patients; 82%), followed by 
SM with subtype unknown (61 patients; 11%), SM-AHN (24 patients; 4%), ASM (8 patients; 
2%),  and MCL (5 patients;  1%). Among  AdvSM  patients,  the incidence  rates  were 0.04 per 
100,000 for SM-AHN, and 0.01 per 100,000 for ASM and MCL [45]. 
In a  retrospective cohort  study of 35 adults  with  SM  diagnosed from  2001–2013 in a  single 
centre in Hungary, the cumulative incidence rate for all SM types was 2.7 per 100,000 [46], 
corresponding to an annual incidence rate of 0.2 per 100,000. 
Prevalence: 
The estimated prevalence of SM in the EU is 9.6 to 50.0 cases per 100,000 population [45, 47]. 
The prevalence of AdvSM has been reported to be 0.052 cases per 10,000 [48]. 
In  the  retrospective  Danish  cohort  study  [45],  the  14‐year  limited‐duration  prevalence  as  of 
01 January 2011 was 9.6 cases of any type of SM per 100,000. Among AdvSM patients, the 
Page 15 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
prevalence  rates  were  3.1 per 100,000  for  SM-AHN,  0.1 per 100,000  for  ASM,  and 
0.0 per 100,000 for MCL [45]. 
Based on latest estimates, the prevalence is 1.0-9.0 cases per 100,000 population for SM-AHN 
[49], 0.1-0.9 per 100,000 for ASM [47], and < 0.1 per 100,000 for MCL [50]. 
Demographics  of  the  Population  in  the  Proposed  Indication  and  Risk  Factors  for  the 
Disease: 
SM preferentially affects Caucasians and there is no sex predominance. It is mainly observed 
in  older  adults  and  elderly  (average  age  at  diagnosis  is  60 years)  and  it  is  very  rare  in  the 
paediatric population [47]. 
Main existing Treatment Options: 
Standard of Care 
Prevention  of  further  organ  damage  by  reducing  MC  burden  is  the  current  goal  in  treating 
AdvSM. However, prior to the approval of avapritinib patients with AdvSM had very limited 
therapeutic  options,  and  patients  with  ISM  and  SSM  have  no  approved  treatment  options. 
Historically,  the  treatment  of  AdvSM  relies  on  systemic  therapies  such  as  cladribine, 
hydroxyurea, and interferon-alpha being used off-label. Based on small case series these agents 
have partial response rates of 35-70% (using the Valent criteria), but responses are often not 
durable and complete remission is rare [37]. Bone marrow MC burden and elevations in serum 
tryptase typically persist both during and after therapy. 
Mediator effects of MC degranulation are treated symptomatically, with antihistamines used to 
control the widespread cutaneous manifestations, pruritus, and excessive gastric acid secretion, 
and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids can reduce MC burden and hence 
serum tryptase levels; however, most symptomatic treatments have no effect on MC burden. 
Importantly, currently used systemic therapies often come at a cost of signiﬁcant and potentially 
life-threatening  side  effects.  In  the  case  of  interferon-alpha,  one third  of  patients  experience 
depression and the adverse effects of therapy can be similar to the symptoms of mastocytosis. 
For cladribine, nearly half of patients experience Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and 80% experience 
prolonged lymphopenia, increasing the risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections [37]. 
Although  many  KIT  inhibitors  of  various  mutations  exist  for  other  indications,  the  D816V 
mutation in the activation loop is particularly challenging to target as it locks the kinase in an 
active conformation. Most KIT inhibitors target the inactive conformation and are therefore not 
effective  against  the  KIT  D816V  mutation.  Several  approved  TKIs,  such  as  imatinib  and 
nilotinib, have activity against wild-type KIT but lack activity against KIT D816V. Imatinib’s 
approval in the US in SM is limited to the small number of patients with ASM lacking the KIT 
D816V mutation [51]. Based on a Phase 2, multicentre study of SM patients with or without 
KIT  D816V  treated  with  nilotinib,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  only  KIT  D816V-negative 
patients  may  beneﬁt.  Dasatinib’s  poor  in  vivo  effectiveness  despite  the  substantial  in  vitro 
activity may reﬂect its short half-life. Based on these disappointing results, dasatinib was not 
developed further for the treatment of mastocytosis [37]. 
Midostaurin 
Midostaurin  is  a  multikinase  inhibitor  that  was  approved  for  FLT3  mutated  acute  myeloid 
leukaemia and is the only agent approved specifically for all subtypes of AdvSM. It inhibits 
D816V mutated KIT with a biochemical half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.9 nM 
[52]. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2017 and by 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2017 based on an open label, single arm, 
Page 16 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Phase 2  clinical  study  in  116 patients  (89 evaluable  for  primary  efficacy  analysis)  [53]  with 
AdvSM and an open label single arm investigator sponsored Phase 2 study in 26 patients with 
AdvSM [54, 55]. 
The objective response rate reported in the US prescribing information is 21% using modified 
Valent  criteria.  Based  on  an  FDA  post-hoc  assessment  using  International  Working  Group-
Myeloproliferative  Neoplasms  Research  and  Treatment-European  Competence  Network  on 
Mastocytosis (IWG-MRT-ECNM) criteria,  the objective response rate (complete and partial 
response, excluding CI) is 17% [56]. The EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for 
midostaurin  reports  an  objective  response  rate  as  high  as  60%  [54].  These  differences  are 
primarily driven by the depth of response that was considered to be clinically significant by 
various response criteria and the agencies. 
Sixty percent of patients treated with midostaurin experienced some improvement in C-findings 
(including  thrombocytopenia,  anaemia,  and  neutropenia  due  to  bone  marrow  involvement; 
splenomegaly with hypersplenism due to spleen infiltration; hepatomegaly with impaired liver 
function,  ascites  and  portal  hypertension;  malabsorption  with  significant  weight  loss  due  to 
gastrointestinal  involvement;  and  large  osteolytic  bone  lesions)  [53,  54];  however,  many  of 
these responses involved only minor or partial improvement and only 28% of patients achieved 
full resolution in one or more C-findings [54]. Importantly, only 17% to 21% of patients had 
substantial  (≥ 50%)  reductions  in  MC  burden  [56]  and  complete  remissions  were  rare 
(0% to 2%) [53, 54, 56]. 
Midostaurin is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea (82%, 
6% Grade ≥3) and vomiting (68%, 6% Grade ≥3), and treatment with prophylactic antiemetics 
is  recommended.  In  addition,  there  is  significant  pulmonary  toxicity  associated  with 
midostaurin, including dyspnoea (18%, 6% Grade ≥3) and pneumonia (9%, 7% Grade ≥3), as 
well as cases of fatal interstitial pneumonitis. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events 
(AEs)  occurred  in  24%  of  patients  [54].  Given  the  modest  activity  and  tolerability  of  the 
available agents prior to the approval of avapritinib, there was a need for more efficacious and 
better-tolerated agents. 
Natural History  of the Indicated Condition  in the Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity: 
Patients with AdvSM may have fewer mediator-release symptoms compared to other forms of 
SM (such as ISM), but much poorer survival outcomes [37, 57]. In patients with AdvSM, the 
median overall survival is 41 to 68 months for ASM, 24 to 35 months for SM-AHN, and 2 to 
23 months for MCL [38, 39]. Prognostic factors that have been associated with inferior survival 
of SM  patients  include  history of weight loss, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and excess  bone 
marrow blasts [39]. 
In  SM  patients,  activated  MCs  release  potent  mediators  that  induce  pathologic  responses  in 
various organs, causing various symptoms including skin reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms, 
cardiovascular symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropsychiatric disturbances [37, 57]. 
MC mediator release is promoted by minimal triggers such as temperature changes, exercise, 
or  emotional  stress  [37,  58,  59].  Certain  types  of  food  may  also  cause  severe  vasomotor 
responses and lead to anaphylaxis [37, 60], and even some of the same medications used to treat 
symptoms  (e.g.,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  opiate  analgesics)  may  increase 
histamine  release  from  mutated  MCs  [37,  61].  For  these  reasons,  substantial  morbidity, 
diminished quality of life, and inability to perform activities of daily living are common. 
Page 17 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Malignant  MCs  may  infiltrate  every  tissue,  but  typical  target  organs  in  AdvSM  are  the 
hematopoietic system (bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes), liver, and gastrointestinal tract. 
C-findings describe typical consequences of MC-induced end organ damage [37, 44]. 
Important Co-Morbidities: 
As the average age when SM is diagnosed is 60 years [47], comorbidities are common, and as 
in  the  case  of  GIST  patients,  may  include  heart  disease,  pulmonary  disease,  diabetes,  and 
arthritis.  Other  relevant  co-morbidities  in  SM  patients  include  immunoglobulin E-dependent 
allergies, psychiatric or psychological problems, and vitamin D deficiency [62]. MC-induced 
symptoms in SM patients may also be aggravated by infections, chronic inflammation or food 
intolerance [62]. 
Approximately  75%  of  patients  with  AdvSM  have  an  associated  haematologic  neoplasm 
contributing to their disease course [39], and 16% to 18% of patients with AdvSM show disease 
transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia [38]. 
In a retrospective study of 342 adult patients with SM, 123 of 138 patients (89%) diagnosed 
with  SM-AHN  had  an  associated  myeloid  neoplasm,  while  the  remainder  had  lymphoma 
(7 patients),  myeloma  (5 patients),  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (2 patients),  or  primary 
amyloidosis  (1 patient)  [36,  39].  Of  the  patients  with  an  associated  myeloid  malignancy, 
55 patients  (45%)  had  SM‐myeloproliferative  neoplasm,  36  (29%)  had  SM‐chronic 
myelomonocytic  leukaemia  and  28  (23%)  had  SM-myelodysplastic  syndrome.  A significant 
proportion (42 patients; 34%) exhibited prominent eosinophilia (≥1.5 × 109/L), especially those 
with  SM‐myeloproliferative  neoplasms  (31 patients;  56%).  Of  the  latter,  12 patients  (39%) 
harboured the FIP1L1‐PDGFRA fusion [36, 39]. 
In the same study, 24 of 41 ASM patients (59%) frequently displayed constitutional symptoms 
fever,  chills,  and  night  sweats.  Patients  also  displayed 
including  weight 
hepatosplenomegaly 
lymphadenopathy  (30%),  severe  anaemia  (haemoglobin 
< 10 g/dL; 24%) or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 109/L; 27%), leucocytosis (41%), and 
markedly elevated serum tryptase levels (> 200 ng/mL; 40%) [36, 39]. 
(50%), 
loss, 
Due to the rarity of MCL in the aforementioned study (4 patients; 1%) [36, 39], no pattern of 
co-morbidities could be established for this patient sub-population. 
SI.3 
Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis 
Patients with ISM suffer from a broad spectrum of persistent and debilitating symptoms [63-
66].  Mutant  KIT  drives  the  accumulation  and  hyperactivity  of  aberrant  MCs,  leading  to 
excessive  signalling  of  vasoactive  and  inflammatory  cytokines,  including  leukotrienes, 
prostaglandins,  and  interleukins  [67].  Aggregates  of  activated  proliferating  MCs,  driven  by 
mutant KIT, result in a constellation of symptoms leading to a significant reduction in quality 
of  life  caused  by  recurrent  diarrhoea,  pruritus,  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  headache,  flushing, 
cognitive impairment, fatigue, bone pain, and disfiguring skin lesions that are observed across 
the spectrum of the disease [68, 69]. In one study, 93% of patients reported ≥ 10 SM-related 
symptoms in their lifetime, with patients experiencing an average of 14 SM-related symptoms, 
the most bothersome of which were reported to be anaphylaxis and abdominal pain, followed 
by diarrhoea and fatigue [64]. Among patients with ISM, 46% experience anaphylaxis [70, 71], 
and the majority of patients report they carry adrenaline auto-injectors at all times [64, 72]. 
MC mediator release can be triggered by normal daily activities including but not limited to 
food,  infection,  natural  and  chemical  odours,  physical  stimuli  (heat,  cold,  friction,  sunlight, 
etc.), physical exertion, bacterial proteins, venom, medication (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
Page 18 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
drugs,  general  anaesthetics),  and  stress  [61,  70].  The  triggers  for  mediator  release  can  be 
unpredictable with patients sometimes reacting to triggers they have not reacted to in the past. 
More than half of patients with ISM report being limited at work or during other daily activities, 
living in fear of attacks and anaphylaxis, finding it difficult to work or attend school, leading to 
isolation to protect against unpredictable triggers and manage diarrhoea [63, 64]. 
Incidence: 
In  a  retrospective  cohort  study  of  adult  patients  with  SM  in  Denmark  [45],  the  estimated 
incidence rate for ISM was estimated at 0.7 per 100,000 population per year. 
Prevalence: 
The  estimated  prevalence  of  all  types  of  SM  in  the  EU  is  9.6  to  50.0 cases  per 
100,000 population  [45,  47],  with  the  estimated  prevalence  of  ISM  accounting  for 
approximately 8.2 cases per 100,000 population [45]. 
In  the  Groningen  region  of  the  Netherlands,  a  major  referral  area  for  patients  with  SM,  the 
prevalence of ISM was estimated at 13.0 cases per 100,000 population [73]. 
Demographics  of  the  Population  in  the  Proposed  Indication  and  Risk  Factors  for  the 
Disease: 
In a study of 333 Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed moderate to severe ISM, the 
mean age was 67 years and 76% of the patients were female [74]. The female predominance 
was consistent with prior studies in SM [75, 76]. Approximately 94% of the beneficiaries were 
white [74]. 
Both advanced and non-advanced SM are characterised by the uncontrolled proliferation and 
activation  of  MCs,  which  are  present  as  aggregates  in  the  skin,  bone  marrow,  spleen,  liver, 
gastrointestinal tract, and other organs [73]. All forms of SM can compromise quality of life 
and be accompanied by significant symptom burden, due to the direct infiltration of MCs in 
various organs, significant aberrant cell signalling, and release of highly bioactive mediators. 
SM can be fatal in its advanced form, but in the non-advanced form, survival is typically not 
compromised  [77].  Despite  this,  patients  with  non-advanced  disease  face  life-long  daily 
challenges  associated  with  aberrant  MC  functioning,  such  as  significant,  burdensome 
symptoms and compromised quality of life, or even recurrent life-threatening anaphylaxis. 
The main risk factor for the development of ISM is acquisition of the somatic driver mutation, 
KIT  D816V.  The  causes  of  KIT  D816V  development  are  unknown;  however,  an  increased 
likelihood of harbouring an autosomal dominant increased copy number of the TPSAB1 gene 
duplications,  also  called  hereditary  α-tryptasaemia,  has  been  found  in  ISM  patients  and 
continues  to  be  investigated  [78].  Increasing  levels  of  serum  tryptase  over  time  have  been 
demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis disease features and disease progression in 
ISM [79]. 
Due to the broad range of nonspecific symptoms, patients with SM present to a diverse group 
of  healthcare  specialists  (e.g.,  primary  care,  dermatologists,  emergency  medicine,  allergists, 
gastroenterologists),  many  of  whom  are  not  familiar  with  this  rare  disorder,  leading  to 
underdiagnosis and potentially years of symptoms prior to diagnosis. The median time from 
symptom onset to diagnosis for patients with ISM is 9 years [63].  In the 12 months prior to 
diagnosis, Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed moderate to severe ISM were found to 
have high rates of specialty physician visits (mean specialty physician visits of 15.3 visits per 
person) [74].

Main Existing Treatment Options: 
Therapies  currently  recommended  for  ISM  are  considered  palliative,  administered  with  the 
intent of only improving symptoms. Currently no therapies treat the underlying driver of ISM 
or  impact  the  ISM  disease  course.  Treatments  for  ISM  include  both  prescription  and 
non-prescription medications (Table 2) that represent the BSC. As patients with ISM harbour a 
wide  spectrum  of  symptoms  that  range  from  being  episodic  to  continuous  with  fluctuating 
severity, patients’ symptoms are typically managed with multiple medications and with dosing 
regimens and duration largely individualised for each patient. These medications are typically 
taken in both a maintenance and breakthrough setting and are often given at doses or frequency 
higher  than  typically  used  in  a  non-SM  setting.  On  average,  SM  patients  are  reported  to 
routinely use ≥3 BSC medications to treat their symptoms [64].

Given  that  none  of  these  supportive  care  medications  significantly  decrease  MC  burden  in 
tissues, more than 70% of patients with ISM continue to report frequent moderate to severe 
symptoms  despite  BSC  and  avoidance  of  known  triggers  [80,  81].  Many  of  the  BSC 
medications are also given at high doses and concomitantly, hence are often accompanied by 
side effects that can negatively impact patient quality of life [82].  
In some cases, there are additional challenges in administrating or obtaining medications for 
ISM  patients  [64,  83,  84].  For  example,  cromolyn  is  commercially  available  in  powder-
containing ampules, which require compounding by specialty pharmacies into a large volume 
liquid formulation that is not available to all patients. In addition to the potential challenges of 
obtaining cromolyn, dosing of large number of liquids up to 4 times daily may cause AEs such 
as vomiting, abdominal pain/discomfort, constipation, erythema, photosensitivity, urticaria, and 
angioedema  [83,  85].  Additionally,  none  of  these  medications  have  been  demonstrated  to 
control  ISM  symptoms  in  randomised  controlled  studies.  Several  case  reports  and  small 
observational studies of omalizumab, an injected anti-immunoglobulin E antibody that has been 
approved  for  treatment  of  allergic  asthma  and  chronic  spontaneous  urticaria,  suggested  that 
omalizumab  might decrease  ISM  symptoms.  Therefore, a double-blind, randomised placebo 
controlled  study  with  predominantly  ISM  patients  was  conducted,  which  failed  to  show 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  symptoms,  including  anaphylaxis  [86].  Thus,  there 
remains  an  unmet  medical  need  in  patients  who  do  not  adequately  respond  to  existing 
symptomatic treatments.

Current  treatment  with  symptom-directed  medications  remains  ineffective  in  a  majority  of 
patients  and  off-label  or  investigational  use  of  cytoreductive  therapies  are  often  poorly 
tolerated.  Patients  report  they  still  have  to  avoid  known  triggers.  Therefore,  there  is  a  high 
unmet  need  for  treatments  that  address  the  underlying  mechanisms  of  this  debilitating 
hematologic disease that provides a more effective and better tolerated treatment for patients 
with ISM. 
Natural History  of the Indicated Condition  in the Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity: 
As  a  non-advanced  form  of  SM,  ISM  typically  does  not  usually  significantly  compromise 
survival. A study found that the median OS of ISM patients was 198 months, which was not 
significantly  different  than  that  of  the  age-matched  and  sex-matched  US  control  population 
[36, 39]. 
Patients with ISM are at risk for progression of their disease. The cumulative probability of 
disease  progression  in  ISM  ranges  from  1.7 ± 1.2%  at  5  to  10 years  to  8.4 ± 5.0%  at 
20 to 25 years [43]. In an analysis of a large European registry, the cumulative probability of 
ISM  disease  progression  was  4.9%  with  a  median  follow-up  of  4.2 years  [87].  Serum 
β2-microglobulin level and multilineage KIT D816V involvement were found to be predictors 
of disease progression [36, 43]. 
Important Co-Morbidities: 
As presented in SI.2, comorbidities in SM patients include heart disease, pulmonary disease, 
diabetes,  and  arthritis.  Other  relevant  co-morbidities  include  immunoglobulin E-dependent 
allergies, psychiatric or psychological problems, vitamin D deficiency, and osteoporosis [62]. 
Infections,  chronic  inflammation  or  food  intolerance  may  also  aggravate  MC-induced 
symptoms in SM patients [62]. 
Hypertension and malignancy were the most observed comorbidities in Medicare beneficiaries 
with moderate to severe ISM [74]. The observed prevalence of comorbidities among the ISM 
patients due to non-age-related factors was higher than among all ISM patients for select mental 
health  conditions  (anxiety:  43%  vs.  29%;  depression  38%  vs.  27%),  pulmonary  diagnoses 
(asthma  43%  vs.  29%;  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  51%  vs.  36%),  and  migraine 
(27% vs. 11%) [74].

PART II: Module SII - Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Key  Safety  Findings  from  Non-Clinical  Studies  and  Relevance  to  Human 
Usage  
Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
The  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)-compliant  28-day  and  3-month  toxicology  studies  of 
avapritinib were conducted in both Sprague Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, as well as chronic 
6-month rat and 9-month dog studies, using the intended clinical regimen of avapritinib daily 
dosing per os (Studies WIL-124507, WIL-124525, WIL-124522, WIL-124508, WIL-124523, 
WIL-124815, and WIL-124816). 
The  key  organs  of  toxicity  in  rat  and/or  dog  included  the  CNS,  haematopoietic,  lymphoid, 
gastrointestinal,  reproductive  (testes  and  ovaries),  and  hepatobiliary  systems,  as  well  as  the 
bones.  These  studies  showed  predominantly  mechanism-related  toxicities,  except  for 
convulsions in rats which was potentially secondary to inhibition of the type 2 sodium channel 
(NaV 1.2). 
Avapritinib-related  clinical  findings  in  rats  included  mortality,  moribundity  (with  related 
observations  of  hunched  posture  and  hypothermia),  and  CNS  effects  such  as  convulsions, 
tremors, hyperreactivity, body weight loss and lower food consumption. 
Clinical pathology findings included reduced haematology parameters among which red blood 
cells, white blood cells (lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts), haematocrit 
and  haemoglobin,  increased  platelet  counts  and  prothrombin  time.  Significant  microscopic 
findings included haemorrhagic luteal cysts, most likely secondary to platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) inhibition and previously reported as a class effect with TKIs 
[88]. 
Avapritinib-related  clinical  findings  in  dogs  included  mortality,  moribundity,  inanition  and 
metabolic  perturbations  with  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  decreased  food  intake,  body  weight  loss, 
haematologic and serum chemistry perturbations and microscopic alterations in several tissues, 
especially oedema and haemorrhage in the brain. Avapritinib-related changes in haematology 
in dogs included lower red blood cell counts, haemoglobin, haematocrit, absolute reticulocytes, 
altered red cell calculated indices, lymphocyte counts and eosinophil counts. 
In the 28-day dog study, the main causes of early death in dogs following short-term (9 days) 
dosing at higher avapritinib doses (45-60 mg/kg/day) were inanition, reduced body weight, and 
poor toleration. Brain lesions were not noted in these early decadents; however, single foci of 
brain haemorrhage were noted at terminal necropsy after 28 days of dosing. 
In the 3-month dog study, mild to moderate haemorrhage and/or minimal to mild choroid plexus 
oedema  were  noted  within  the  brain  at  15 and  30 mg/kg/day  resulting  in  pre-terminal 
moribundity  and  euthanasia  within  the  first  month  of  dosing.  The  brain  haemorrhage  was 
multifocal, acute to subacute, and was often perivascular or periventricular. Brain haemorrhage 
was the main cause of death in these animals. 
Minimal haemorrhage in the spinal cord was also noted in the affected dogs. The spinal cord 
haemorrhage was multifocal, acute, perivascular, and was often located in the spinal cord grey 
matter. In comparing the 28-day and 3-month dog studies, the brain haemorrhage exacerbated 
from  single  foci  in  the  28-day  study  to  multi-focal  lesions  in  the  3-month  study,  indicating 
progression of the lesions with increasing duration of treatment. Brain haemorrhage was not 
noted in the 9-month dog study up to the maximum dose tested, 5 mg/kg/day. 
Page 22 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan

It was presumed that the oedema and haemorrhage noted in the brain in dogs was potentially 
secondary  to  inhibition  of  PDGFRB  on  pericytes,  thereby  compromising  vascular  integrity 
[89-91]. 
The  underlying  mechanism  that  would  explain  the  increased  sensitivity  of  dogs  to  brain 
haemorrhage,  despite  their  relatively  lower  exposure  compared  to  rats,  remains  unclear. 
Non-clinical studies in rats have demonstrated that avapritinib penetrates the blood-brain barrier 
and results in measurable levels of avapritinib in the brain. 
  Relevance  to  human  use:  Haemorrhage  in  the  brain  and  spinal  cord  occurred  in  dogs  at 
doses  greater  than  or  equal  to  15 mg/kg/day  (approximately 9.0, 1.8,  and  0.8 times  the 
human exposure based  on  the  area under the  plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) at 
25 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg dose once daily, respectively) and choroid plexus oedema in 
the  brain  occurred 
to  7.5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 4.7, 1.0, and 0.4 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical 
dose  of  25 mg,  200 mg,  and  300 mg  once  daily,  respectively).  These  findings  were  not 
accompanied  by  consistent,  clinically  translatable  prodromal  CNS-related  clinical  signs 
such as tremors, ataxia, or convulsions in the absence of overall moribundity. 
in  dogs  at  doses  greater 
than  or  equal 
Intracranial  bleeding,  including  subdural  haematoma,  haemorrhage  intracranial  and 
cerebral  haemorrhage  occurred  in  the  avapritinib  clinical  trials  in  GIST  and  AdvSM 
patients, suggesting a potential correlation between the preclinical findings and human use 
in these patient populations.  
The potential mechanism for brain haemorrhage in dogs and ovarian haemorrhage in rats is 
considered  to  be  inhibition  of  PDGFRB.  Thrombocytopenia  is  a  risk  factor  in  AdvSM 
patients but was not observed in rats or dogs. 
Based on the preclinical findings correlated with the clinical data, intracranial haemorrhage 
is an important identified risk associated with avapritinib in patients with GIST and AdvSM, 
while  it  represents  an  important  potential  risk  in  patients  with  ISM  (refer  to  PART  II: 
Module SVII).  
Genotoxicity 
Five GLP-compliant assays were conducted for avapritinib: bacterial reverse mutation assay 
(Study WIL-124504); in vitro chromosome aberration test in cultured human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes  (Study  WIL-124505);  and  in  vivo  bone  marrow  micronucleus  (Study 
WIL-124506) and liver comet (Studies 9800604 and 9800938) assays in Sprague Dawley rats. 
In  addition,  GLP-compliant  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assays  were  conducted  for  three 
impurities of avapritinib drug substance (Study 00124800, Study 00124801, Study 00124802). 
Avapritinib  was  not  mutagenic  in  the  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay.  In  the  in-vitro 
mammalian  cell  chromosome  aberration  test,  avapritinib  demonstrated  minimal  potential  to 
cause structural chromosomal aberrations. However, avapritinib did not induce micronuclei in 
the bone marrow or the liver in the repeated-dose chromosomal aberration studies in rats. 
Overall, avapritinib is non-genotoxic. Three specific impurities identified in avapritinib drug 
substance were also tested and shown to be non-mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay. 
  Relevance  to  human  use:  There was  little to  no  evidence of genotoxicity in  in-vitro and 
in-vivo  non-clinical  toxicology  studies  conducted  within  the  non-clinical  development 
programme for avapritinib. No genotoxic potential is expected in humans.

  Relevance to human use: A 2-year carcinogenicity study with avapritinib is ongoing. 
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
The effects of avapritinib on fertility and early embryonic development to implantation were 
assessed in a repeated-dose GLP-compliant study in rats (Study 00124844), and the effects on 
developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity study were assessed in a repeat-dose range finding 
GLP-compliant study in gravid Sprague Dawley rats exposed to avapritinib during the critical 
period of organogenesis (Study 124704). 
Avapritinib  did  not  affect  male  or  female  fertility  in  rats  up  to  the  highest  tested  dose  of 
30 mg/kg/day (180 mg/m2/day) in males and 20 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day) in females. The 
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for early embryonic toxicity was at the lowest dose 
tested of 3 mg/kg/day (18 mg/m2/day) due to effects on implantation and intrauterine survival 
at higher doses. 
In  gravid  rats,  avapritinib  was  tolerated  up  to  the  highest  tested  dose  of  30 mg/kg/day 
(180 mg/m2/day).  Based  on  adverse  ovarian  haemorrhages  that  resulted  in  an  increased 
frequency  of  resorptions  at  ≥10 mg/kg/day  (60 mg/m2/day),  a  dose  of  5 mg/kg/day 
(30 mg/m2/day) was the NOAEL for maternal toxicity. 
Based on the adverse decreases in foetal weights, viability (higher mean litter proportions of 
post-implantation  loss  and  lower  mean  litter  proportions  and/or  mean  numbers  of  viable 
foetuses),  and/or  increases  in  visceral  and  skeletal  malformations  at  ≥10 mg/kg/day 
(60 mg/m2/day),  a  dose  of  5 mg/kg/day  (30 mg/m2/day)  was  the  NOAEL  for  embryofoetal 
developmental toxicity. 
  Relevance to human use: Avapritinib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses 31.4, 
6.3,  and  2.7-times  greater  than  the  human  exposure  at  the  therapeutic  doses  of  25 mg, 
200 mg, and 300 mg avapritinib, respectively. There were no direct effects on fertility in 
either sex at the highest dose levels tested in this study (100.8 and 62.6 times the human 
exposure (AUC) at 25 mg, 20.3 and 9.5 times the human exposure (AUC) at 200 mg, and 
8.7 and 4.1 times the human exposure (AUC) at 300 mg). 
No  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  clinical  development  programme  for  avapritinib. 
Avapritinib-related embryotoxicity and teratogenicity is a mechanism-related class effect 
reported  with  other  TKIs,  such  as  imatinib  [92].  Embryofoetal  toxicity  is  an  important 
potential risk associated with avapritinib (refer to PART II: Module SVII).

Safety Pharmacology 
Effects on CNS 
In vitro safety pharmacology studies (Studies 100013720 and 100014090) demonstrated that 
avapritinib  inhibits  NaV 1.2  with  IC50  of  the  free  drug  at  280 nM.  Inhibition  of  NaV 1.2  is 
considered to be the cause of convulsions noted in rats. 
Oral administration of avapritinib at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day for 15 consecutive days resulted 
in  increased  corneal  reflex  and  increased  pinna  reflex  in  1  of  6 animals  in  an  in-vivo 
neurofunctional safety pharmacology study (Study WIL-124502) in rats. These signs were first 
observed on Study Day 7 and had resolved by Study Day 10. A dose of 45 mg/kg/day resulted 
in  increased  touch  response,  increased  corneal  reflex,  increased  pinna  reflex,  head  flicking, 
exophthalmos,  increased  startle  response,  aggressiveness,  vocalisation,  increased  pain 
response, and/or tremors in up to 2 of 6 animals. These signs were first observed on Day 11, 
peaked at Day 13 and were still present on Day 14, the last day of the study. These findings 
indicate  an  increase  in  sensitivity  to  stimuli  and  are  potentially  underlying  indictors  of  pre-
convulsive activity. No avapritinib–related effects on the gross behavioural, physiological, or 
neurological state of the animals were noted at a dose level of 15 mg/kg/day which was the 
NOAEL in this study. 
Two non-GLP compliant studies were conducted in Sprague Dawley rats using subcutaneously 
implanted electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes (Studies WIL-124530 and WIL-124538). 
The studies demonstrated that EEG changes correlated with an avapritinib-induced increase in 
seizure potential or decreased seizure threshold in rats, and that avapritinib-mediated seizures 
were ameliorated by diazepam. 
  Relevance  to  human  use:  Seizures  or  convulsions  were  observed  in  rats  at  high,  poorly 
tolerated doses exceeding the highest non-severely toxic dose in this species. Seizures in 
rats  occurred  at  systemic  exposures  ≥8-fold  higher  than  the  exposure  in  patients  at  the 
300 mg/day avapritinib dose level, and there were no microscopic correlates in the brains 
of these rats. 
The pooled safety analysis of data from the clinical trials did not reveal any related risks in 
humans. In the overall safety population (N = 749), seizure was reported in only 3 patients 
(< 1%;  serious  in  1 patient,  non-serious  in  2 patients),  whereas  epilepsy  was  reported  in 
2 patients  (< 1%;  serious  in  both  patients,  neither  of  whom  were  in  the  AdvSM  patient 
group). In all patients but in 1 patient who had seizure, the events were assessed as related 
to avapritinib. 
Even  though  the  potential  of  avapritinib  to  cause  seizures  in  humans  cannot  be  fully 
excluded, based on data collected from the clinical development programme, this potential 
risk is not considered important for inclusion in the RMP as further discussed in PART II: 
Module SVII. 
Neurocognitive effects of avapritinib were seen in the clinical development programme as 
events  of  cognitive  impairment.  Memory  impairment  studies  in  rats  failed  to  provide  a 
translatable  model  for  the  neurocognitive  defects  seen  in  patients,  nor  were  they  able  to 
evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies (e.g., patient monitoring with EEG, 
dose cessation or reduction, or co-treatment with a neurostimulant antidote). In addition, 
the  potential  role  of  any  metabolites  of  avapritinib  in  causing  memory  impairment  in 
patients is not known. It is unlikely that the levels of free avapritinib in the brain of affected 
patients would be high enough to cause meaningful inhibition of NaV 1.2 (IC50 = 280 nM), 
therefore, it  is unlikely  that inhibition of NaV 1.2  in  the brain  may cause  neurocognitive 
Page 25 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan

effects. Overall, the mechanism of neurocognitive effects is unknown. Nevertheless, based 
on  the  clinical  data,  cognitive  effects  (e.g.,  memory  impairment,  cognitive  disorder, 
confusional state, amnesia, somnolence, speech disorder, encephalopathy, delirium, mental 
impairment,  hallucination,  mood  altered,  agitation,  disorientation,  personality  change, 
dementia,  mental  status  change,  and  psychotic  disorder)  is  an  important  identified  risk 
associated with avapritinib in patients with GIST and AdvSM, and important potential risk 
in patients with ISM (refer to PART II: Module SVII). 
Effects on Cardiovascular System 
Avapritinib inhibited the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel activity with IC50 
of 2.4 μM in vitro in a GLP-compliant hERG assay (Study 140717.XSM). This concentration 
is more than 100-fold above the free geometric mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at 
steady state of 0.018 μM at the recommended human dose of 300 mg/day in patients with GIST. 
In a GLP-compliant cardiopulmonary safety pharmacology study in radiotelemetry-implanted 
dogs (Study WIL-124501), no avapritinib-related effects were observed on any cardiovascular 
parameter (heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure), 
body temperature, electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform morphology, duration of PR, QRS, RR, 
QT, and heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc), respiratory parameters, or the clinical condition 
of the animals. The observed steady state geometric mean Cmax of approximately 1,500 ng/mL 
observed at the high dose of 45 mg/kg in the dog cardiopulmonary study was approximately 
2-fold greater than the steady state geometric mean Cmax of 813 ng/mL at the recommended 
human dose of 300 mg QD in Study BLU-285-1101. 
There  were  no  observations  of  QT  prolongation  in  the  28-day  and  3-month  dog  toxicology 
studies (Study WIL-124508 and Study WIL-124523). 
A  single-dose,  whole  body  autoradiography  study  in  rats  did  not  indicate  preferential 
distribution of avapritinib in the heart (Study 124696). 
  Relevance to human use: The non-clinical studies did not show any effects of avapritinib 
on the cardiovascular system. 
In clinical Study BLU-285-1101, a small increase in the QTc interval (6.55 ms [(90% CI: 
1.80 to 11.29)] at 300/400 mg QD clinical dose) was observed in a subset of GIST patients; 
however, this increase was not clinically relevant. 
The mechanism for this slight QTc prolongation in certain patients treated with avapritinib 
is  not  understood.  Based  on  the  preclinical  Study 124696,  there  is  no  evidence  of  a 
preferential distribution of avapritinib in the heart to suggest any cardiovascular effect due 
to high local concentrations in the heart. 
Cardiac  toxicity  and  the  potential  for  QT  prolongation  is  considered  a  class  effect  of 
small-molecule TKIs; however, the impact differs between individual agents [93-96]. 
Cardiac  toxicity  seen  mostly  with  multitarget  TKIs  ranged  from  asymptomatic 
QT prolongation to reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction, symptomatic congestive 
heart  failure,  acute  coronary  syndromes,  and  myocardial  infarction.  Hypertension  and 
sudden  death  have  also  been  associated  mostly  with  multitarget  TKIs  [93-95].  The 
relevance of these findings to avapritinib remains unknown.

Interactions with Other Medicinal Products 
In-vitro  studies  showed  that  avapritinib  phase I  metabolism  is  predominantly  mediated  by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), CYP3A5, and to a minor extent by CYP2C9 
(Studies 140415, CYP0915-R3, and CYP0915-R4). 
In  vitro,  avapritinib  inhibited  CYP3A4  with  the  IC50  values  of  21.6 µM  (testosterone 
6β-hydroxylation) and 27.9 µM (midazolam 1’-hydroxylation), respectively. The R1 values for 
CYP3A4 inhibition and R1,gut value for CYP3A4 inhibition for avapritinib are either at or above 
the  threshold  for  a  potential  clinical  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  (R1 ≥ 1.02  and  R1,gut > 11) 
(Study CYP0915-R3) [97, 98]. 
In vitro, avapritinib demonstrated a time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 with a KI of 12.3 μM 
and  kinact  of  0.0301 min-1.  The  resulting  inactivation  efficiency  (kinact/KI)  for  CYP3A4  was 
2.45 mL/min/μmol.  The  estimated  R2  value  is  above  the  threshold  for  a  potential  DDI 
(R2 ≥ 1.25) (Study CYP0915-R4). 
In human hepatocytes, avapritinib increased CYP3A4 messenger ribonucleic acid expression 
with  an  EC50  of  0.36 μM  and  a  maximal  induction  effect  of  5.7-fold.  However,  no 
corresponding  increase  in  CYP3A4  enzyme  activity  was  observed,  likely  due  to  concurrent 
time-dependent  inhibition  of  CYP3A4.  The  estimated  R3  value  is  ≤ 0.8,  hence  DDIs  with 
comedications that are predominantly metabolised by CYP3A are possible, causing them to be 
ineffective due to decreased exposure. 
Using the basic models of reversible inhibition, the time-dependent inhibition and induction, 
avapritinib is anticipated to alter the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrate drugs at clinically 
relevant  exposure  via  its  time-dependent  inhibition  (R2 ≥ 1.25)  or  induction  of  CYP3A4 
(R3 ≤ 0.8). 
  Relevance  to  human  use:  The  non-clinical  data  showed  that  in  vitro,  avapritinib  is  a 
time-dependent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A  and  an  inducer  of  CYP3A.  Therefore,  DDIs  with 
comedications for which CYP3A-mediated metabolism constitutes the primary mechanism 
of clearance are likely to occur, resulting in increased exposure to the comedication. 
Avapritinib  phase I  metabolism  is  primarily  mediated  by  CYP3A4,  thus,  concomitant 
treatment with drugs that are moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter 
avapritinib  plasma  concentrations  and  may  result  in  increased  frequency  or  severity  of 
adverse reactions.

Nonetheless,  the  exact  clinical  outcomes  of  these  interactions  in  clinical  practice,  their

The DDIs with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers represent an important 
identified  risk  of  avapritinib.  In  the  absence  of  any  clinical  data,  DDIs  with  CYP3A 
substrates represent missing information of avapritinib (refer to PART II: Module SVII). 
Phototoxicity 
Two  GLP-compliant  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  in  vitro  neutral  red  uptake 
phototoxicity of avapritinib in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Study 20137416) and the in vivo

avapritinib  phototoxicity  potential  after  oral  administration  in  pigmented  Long  Evans  rats 
(Study 20142828). 
Avapritinib  showed  a  weak  potential  for  phototoxicity  in  the  in  vitro  3T3  mouse  fibroblast 
assay. Avapritinib demonstrated minimal potential for dermal phototoxicity in the phototoxicity 
study in pigmented Long Evans rats. These effects are consistent with the ultraviolet (UV) light 
absorption  characteristics  of  avapritinib  (Molar  Extinction  Coefficient  in  UV  range 
> 1,000 L mol-1 cm-1). 
  Relevance to human use:  
Non-clinical  in-vitro  and  in-vivo  studies  showed  that  avapritinib  has  a  potential  for 
phototoxicity,  consistent  with  the  UV  absorption  characteristics  and  the  preferential 
distribution in the uvea of the eye likely due to melanin binding. 
In the clinical development programme, patients were advised to wear protective clothing 
and  sunscreen,  and  to  avoid  direct  sun  exposure.  Overall,  2.1%  of  the  749 patients  who 
received treatment with avapritinib for the indications of GIST and AdvSM experienced 
photosensitivity reaction, representing 10 patients (1.7%) with GIST and 6 patients (4.1%) 
with AdvSM. In 14 patients (1.9%), the events were treatment related. All photosensitivity 
reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and assessed as non-serious. Phototoxicity events 
occurred with low incidence and low severity, without any serious clinical consequences 
and as such, it is considered that the risk of phototoxicity has minimal clinical impact on 
patients and on the benefit-risk profile of avapritinib (refer to PART II: Module SVII for 
further details).

PART II: Module SIII - Clinical Trial Exposure 
The  clinical  development  programme  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  avapritinib  in 
patients with GIST and AdvSM included data from studies BLU-285-1101, BLU-285-1303, 
BLU-285-2101, and BLU-285-2202, and therefore, the safety population was represented by 
the pooled safety analyses set of these four clinical trials. 
Given the less-aggressive course of ISM, the difference in the recommended dose for patients 
with ISM (25 mg QD) as compared to those in patients with AdvSM (200 mg QD) and GIST 
(300 mg  QD)  as  well  as  the  different  benefit-risk  considerations,  the  evidence  of  safety  for 
patients with ISM is based on the ongoing study BLU-285-2203. 
Detailed  information  on  the  clinical  development  programme  for  avapritinib  is  available  in 
eCTD Module 2.5.

PART II: Module SIV - Populations not Studied in Clinical Trials 
SIV.1 
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme 
The  important  exclusion  criteria  from  the  pivotal  studies  BLU-285-1101,  BLU-285-1303, 
BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202 in patients with GIST and AdvSM, and BLU-285-2203 in 
patients with ISM are summarised below. 
1. Hepatically impaired patients 
As defined by alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3 × upper 
limit  of  normal  (ULN);  > 5 × ULN  if  hepatic  metastases  are  present  (GIST  only);  total 
bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN; and in presence of Gilbert’s disease, total bilirubin > 3 × ULN or 
direct bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN (GIST and ISM only) or > 2.0 × ULN (AdvSM only). 
  Reason for exclusion: 
This exclusion criterion was established to minimise the potential confounding factors for 
evaluation of the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of avapritinib. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes 
  Rationale:  
Not applicable. 
2. Renally impaired patients 
As defined by persistent proteinuria of Grade 3 or higher (according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 5.0); or as 
defined  by  estimated  (per  institutional  standard;  e.g.,  Cockcroft-Gault  formula  and 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) and measured creatinine clearance (CLcr) 
< 40 mL/min. 
  Reason for exclusion: 
This  exclusion  criterion  was  established  to  minimise  potential  confounding  factors  for 
evaluation of the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of avapritinib. 
Avapritinib is primarily metabolised in the liver, with unchanged avapritinib representing 
as little as 11.00% and 0.23% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, respectively. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
  Rationale:  
Following a single oral dose of ~310 mg (~100 μCi) [14C]-avapritinib, faecal excretion was 
the predominant route of elimination of drug-related material (70.3%) and excretion in urine 
was the secondary route of elimination (17.9%). Based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, avapritinib exposures were similar among 88 subjects with mild renal impairment 
(CLcr  60  to  89 mL/min),  24 subjects  with  moderate  renal  impairment  (CLcr  30  to 
59 mL/min) and 230 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min), suggesting 
that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  
The  pharmacokinetics  and safety  of  avapritinib  in patients  with  severe renal impairment 
(CLcr  15  to  29 mL/min)  or  end-stage  renal  disease  (CLcr  < 15 mL/min)  have  not  been 
studied.  
Page 43 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
The  impact  of  reduced  renal  function  on  avapritinib’s  protein  binding  capacity  was 
investigated. Plasma protein binding of avapritinib was tested at 3 concentrations (0.1, 1 and 
10 μM)  in plasma from  healthy  subjects (N=3)  and patients with  chronic  kidney disease 
(N=3). The 3 patients with chronic kidney disease had estimated glomerular filtration rate 
< 30 mL/min. The concentrations at 0.1 μM were below the lower limit of quantification, 
therefore, the extent of protein binding could not be determined. At 1 and 10 μM, the plasma 
protein  binding  was  similar  between  healthy  subjects  and  patients  with  chronic  kidney 
disease.  Thus,  reduced  renal  function  does  not  impact  avapritinib’s  protein  binding 
capacity. Therefore, no further analysis or investigation, including pharmacokinetic study, 
is deemed necessary in subjects with reduced renal function. 
3. Patients  requiring therapy with  a concomitant medication that is a strong  inhibitor, 
strong inducer, or moderate inducer of CYP3A4 
  Reason for exclusion: 
Data  from  non-clinical  studies  (refer  to  PART  II:  Module  SII)  revealed  that  phase I 
metabolism  of  avapritinib  is  predominantly  mediated  by  CYP3A4,  CYP3A5,  and  with 
minor contribution from CYP2C9. Thus, plasma levels of avapritinib can be affected when 
administered concomitantly with a strong CYP3A inhibitor or strong CYP3A inducer. As 
such,  this  exclusion  criterion  was  established  as  a  precautionary  measure  to  minimise 
potentially confounding factors for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of avapritinib. 
The  initial  exclusion  criterion  was  further  amended  based  on  findings  from  the  clinical 
pharmacology  Study BLU-285-0104,  which  showed  that  co-administration  of  a  strong 
CYP3A4  inducer,  rifampicin  (600 mg  QD  for  18 days),  with  a  single  400 mg  dose  of 
avapritinib on Day 9 decreased avapritinib Cmax by 74% and AUC from time 0 to infinity 
(AUC0-inf)  by  92%,  relative  to  a  400 mg  dose  of  avapritinib  administered  alone. 
Additionally, co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg twice 
daily  on  Day 1  followed  by  200 mg  QD  for  13 days)  with  a  single  200 mg  dose  of 
avapritinib  on  Day 4  increased  avapritinib  Cmax  by  1.4-fold  and  AUC0-inf  by  4.2-fold, 
relative to a 200 mg dose of avapritinib administered alone. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? No. 
  Rationale:  
It is expected that administration of avapritinib together with a moderate or strong CYP3A 
inhibitor or inducer will lead to changes in the avapritinib plasma concentration, resulting 
in either an increased risk of adverse reactions or decreased efficacy. Although not observed 
in  clinical  trials  due to  the  exclusion  criterion  as  mentioned  above,  these  changes  might 
have significant clinical outcomes with impact on the patients treated with avapritinib. As 
such,  the  DDIs  with  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  or  inducers  represent  an 
important identified risk of avapritinib for all indications (refer to PART II: Module SVII).

4. Patients with a QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) of > 450 ms 
(GIST and ISM only) or > 480 ms (AdvSM only); 
Patients with a history of prolonged QT syndrome or Torsade de pointes; 
Patients with a family history of prolonged QT syndrome 
  Reason for exclusion: 
The potential for QT interval prolongation has been observed with the use of small-molecule 
TKIs  [96,  99, 100]. As  such, these  exclusion  criteria  were  established as  a precautionary 
measure,  to  decrease  the  number  of  patients  that  could  potentially  develop  severe 
cardiovascular events. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
  Rationale:  
The  ability  of  avapritinib  to  prolong  the  QT  interval  was  assessed  in  27 patients  from 
Study BLU-285-1101,  who  were  administered  avapritinib  at  doses  of  300/400 mg  QD 
(i.e., 12 to 16 times the 25 mg dose recommended for ISM patients, 1.33 times the 300 mg 
dose recommended for GIST patients). The estimated mean change from baseline in QTcF 
was  6.55 ms  (90%  CI:  1.80-11.29)  at  the  observed  steady  state  geometric  mean  Cmax  of 
899 ng/mL. No effect on heart rate or cardiac conduction (PR, QRS, and RR intervals) was 
observed. 
Considering the class potential of certain small-molecule TKIs to cause QTc prolongation 
[96]  and  cardiac  toxicity  associated  with  multitarget  TKIs  [93-95],  cardiac  toxicity, 
including QT prolongation is considered an important potential risk for avapritinib (refer to 
PART II: Module SVII for further details). 
 5.  Patients  with  a  history  of  a  cerebrovascular  accident  or  transient  ischaemic  attack 
within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug; 
Patients with a known risk of intracranial bleeding, such as a brain aneurysm or history 
of subdural or subarachnoid bleeding; 
Patients with a primary brain malignancy or metastases to the brain. 
  Reason for exclusion: 
In non-clinical studies (refer to PART II: Module SII), CNS haemorrhage was observed at 
subtherapeutic exposure multiples (30 mg/kg/day in dogs). 
In  addition,  intracranial  haemorrhage  was  associated  with  use  of  other  TKIs  such  as 
dasatinib  or  imatinib  [101],  including  their  use  in  patients  with  GIST  [102].  As  such, 
patients considered at higher risk of experiencing intracranial bleeding were excluded from 
clinical trials. 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
  Rationale:  
Intracranial  haemorrhage  (e.g.,  haemorrhage  intracranial,  cerebral  haemorrhage,  and 
subdural haematoma) is considered an important identified risk associated with the use of 
avapritinib in patients with GIST and AdvSM, while an important potential risk in patients 
with ISM. The risk factors and special populations at risk for such events are presented in 
detail in PART II: Module SVII.

Female  patients  who  are  pregnant,  as  documented  by  a  serum  beta  human  chorionic

31.4, 6.3, 2.7 times  greater  than  the  human  exposure  at  the  therapeutic  dose  of  25 mg, 
200 mg, and 300 mg avapritinib, respectively (refer to PART II: Module SII). Therefore, the 
above  exclusion  criteria  represented  a  standard  measure  to  avoid  any  adverse  effects  on 
pregnancy. 
in 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
  Rationale:  
Pregnant or lactating women were excluded from the clinical development programme, and 
women of child-bearing potential were required to use appropriate methods of contraception 
during the treatment course with avapritinib and for 6 weeks for females and 2 weeks for 
males after the last administered dose. As such, there are no data on the use of avapritinib 
in this special patient population.  
However, non-clinical studies showed that avapritinib is teratogenic and embryotoxic and 
it  is  expected  to  have  similar  effects  in  humans. Foetal  toxicity  has  been  reported  with 
post-marketing use of other TKIs [92, 103]. As such, embryofoetal toxicity is considered as 
an important potential risk for all indications (refer to PART II: Module SVII). 
7. Women who are breastfeeding  
  Reason for exclusion: 
Exclusion of breastfeeding women represents a standard ethical measure. 
No non-clinical studies were conducted to evaluate whether avapritinib or its metabolites are 
excreted  in  the  milk  of  a  lactating  female.  As  such,  the  effects  of  avapritinib  on  this 
population could not be anticipated, and a risk to the breastfed child could not be excluded 
(refer to PART II: Module SII). 
  Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
  Rationale:  
There are no data regarding the secretion of avapritinib or its metabolites in human milk nor 
on their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for 
adverse  reactions  in  breastfed  infants  from  avapritinib,  breastfeeding  should  be 
discontinued during treatment with avapritinib and for 2 weeks after the last administered 
dose. As such, it is expected that avapritinib will not be used by breastfeeding women, and 
no  data  on  use  in  this  population  are  expected  to  be  collected  from  the  post-marketing 
setting.

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programme 
The data set pooled for evaluation of the clinical safety of avapritinib in patients with GIST and 
AdvSM  originates  from  studies  BLU-285-1101,  BLU-285-1303,  BLU-285-2101,  and 
BLU-285-2202, whereas the clinical development programme in patients with ISM includes 
data from study BLU-285-2203 only. 
Avapritinib has an orphan designation for treatment of GIST and for treatment of mastocytosis. 
The clinical development programme is unlikely  to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such  as  uncommon  and  rare  adverse  reactions  (considering  the  overall  safety  population  of 
803 patients with GIST and AdvSM, and 246 patients with ISM), adverse reactions with a long 
latency, or those caused by prolonged exposure.

PART II: Module SV - Post-Authorisation Experience 
SV.1 
Post-Authorisation Exposure 
Avapritinib received the first marketing authorisation approval in the US on 09 January 2020 
under the trade  name AYVAKIT for  the  treatment of adults  with  unresectable or metastatic 
GIST harbouring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. The 
date  of  this  initial  marketing  authorisation  represents  the  International  Birth  Date  (IBD)  for 
avapritinib. AYVAKIT was subsequently approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients 
with AdvSM, including patients with ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL on 16 June 2021. 
In the EU/EEA, avapritinib received the marketing authorisation on 24 September 2020 under 
the trade name AYVAKYT for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. AYVAKYT was subsequently approved in 
the  EU/EEA  on  24 March 2022  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  ASM,  SM-AHN  or 
MCL, after at least one systemic therapy. 
At  the  data  lock  point  (DLP)  of  the  latest  periodic  benefit-risk  evaluation  report  (PBRER) 
(08 July 2022), avapritinib was marketed in 9 countries, including 5 EU countries (Denmark, 
France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands).  
SV.1.1  Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
The  following  points  are  considered  when  estimating  the  patient  exposure  from  the 
post-marketing experience with avapritinib:  
  Patient-years are calculated based on the actual number of dispensed tablets and not the 
number of bottles dispensed (each bottle contains 30 tablets of avapritinib).  
  The  number of patient-days  is  the same as  the number  of  dispensed tablets,  i.e., it is 
assumed that 1 tablet is taken per day regardless of the tablet strength.  
  365 represents the number of days in a year.  
SV.1.2 
Patient Exposure from Marketing Experience 
Since  the  IBD  until  the  DLP  of  the  latest  PBRER  (08 July 2022),  the  overall  estimated 
post-marketing exposure to avapritinib is 1,222.72 patient-years. 
Cumulatively until the DLP of the latest PBRER (08 July 2022), 22,710 tablets of avapritinib 
were dispensed in the EU/EEA. This corresponds to an estimated 62.22 patient-years. 
Data by age, sex, or other demographic characteristics are not available for the exposure from 
the post-marketing experience with avapritinib.

PART II: Module SVII - Identified and Potential Risks 
SVII.1 
Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
SVII.1.1  Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP: 
  Risks  with  minimal  clinical  impact  on  patients  (in  relation  to  the  severity  of  the 
indication treated) or on the benefit-risk profile of avapritinib: 
Seizures 
Seizures  or  convulsions  were  observed  in  rats  at  high,  poorly  tolerated  doses  exceeding  the 
highest non-severely toxic dose (refer to PART II: Module SII). Seizures in rats occurred at 
systemic exposures ≥8-fold higher than the exposure in patients at the 300 mg/day dose level, 
and there were no microscopic correlates in the brains of these rats. 
Overall, in the clinical development programme as of the DLP of the initial RMP (18 December 
2018), 2 (0.6%) of the 335 patients who received treatment with avapritinib experienced events 
of seizure. Both patients were part of the GIST group, with a starting dose of < 300 mg. 
One  patient  experienced  a  Grade 2  event  of  ‘seizure’,  and  one  patient  experienced  a 
Grade 1 event of  ‘epilepsy’. Both  events  were non-serious.  None of the  patients  had a prior 
medical history of seizures or epilepsy, however, the event of seizure occurred in a patient with 
cerebral haemorrhage. No change in study drug dosing was made as a result of these events. At 
the time of this RMP, the event of ‘seizure’ resolved, and the event of ‘epilepsy’ was ongoing. 
The  Investigators  assessed  the  events  as  possibly  related  to  study  drug.  Given  the  limited 
amount of information available for these 2 non-serious events, a causal association to study 
drug cannot be ruled out. 
In addition, by the time of the of the 08 July 2019 data cut-off, one additional non-serious event 
of ‘seizure’ occurred. Therefore, 3 (0.6%) of the overall 506 patients who received avapritinib 
experienced events of seizure. All 3 events occurred in GIST patients. 
Events  of  seizure  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  patients’  quality  of  life  and  can  lead  to 
long-term  sequelae if  not managed in a  timely manner. However,  in spite of the findings  in 
animal models showing avapritinib at high doses can cause seizures, these findings were not 
replicated in humans, with only two non-serious events of seizure occurring as of the DLP of 
the initial RMP (18 December 2018). As such, the risk is considered acceptable in relation to 
the severity of the indication treated. No risk minimisation measures are deemed necessary at 
this time and routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient for further characterising this 
risk. 
Phototoxicity 
Non-clinical  in-vitro  and  in-vivo  studies  showed  that  avapritinib  has  a  potential  for 
phototoxicity, consistent with the UV absorption characteristics and the preferential distribution 
in the uvea of the eye likely due to melanin binding. 
Overall, as of the DLP of the initial RMP (18 December 2018), 3% of the 335 patients who 
received  treatment  with  avapritinib  for  the  indications  of  GIST  and  AdvSM,  experienced 
photosensitivity  reaction,  representing  9 patients  with  GIST  and  1 patient  with  AdvSM.  All 
events were treatment related, Grade 1 or 2 in severity and assessed as not serious. 
Page 50 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Patients in the avapritinib clinical development programme were advised to avoid or minimise 
sun exposure through use of sunscreen and clothing. Phototoxicity events occurred with low 
incidence and low severity, without any serious clinical consequences. As such, it is considered 
that  the  risk  has  minimal  clinical  impact  on  patients  and  on  the  benefit-risk  profile  of 
avapritinib. 
  Risks with clinical consequences, even serious (but occurring with a low frequency), 
considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication treated: 
Fluid retention (pleural effusion) 
Overall as of the DLP of the initial RMP (18 December 2018), 11.3% of the 335 patients who 
received treatment with avapritinib for the indications of GIST and AdvSM, experienced events 
of  pleural  effusion,  representing  31 patients  with  GIST  and  7 patients  with  AdvSM.  The 
majority of events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, but events ≥Grade 3 also occurred, in 2.1% of 
the patients. Only 2.6% of patients with GIST and 4.4% of patients with AdvSM experienced 
serious events of pleural effusion. One patient experienced a fatal event but was assessed as not 
related  to  the  treatment.  One  patient  discontinued  the  treatment  in  response  to  the  event  of 
pleural effusion. 
Pleural  effusions  are  an  expected  and  manageable  toxicity  in  advanced  GIST,  most  likely 
related  to  inhibition  of  wild-type  KIT/PDGFRA  [104,  105].  Although  the  events  of  pleural 
effusion occurred with a high frequency in the clinical development programme, the serious or 
clinically significant cases were infrequent. The risk is easily manageable through routine, well-
established  clinical  measures,  including  administration  of  diuretics  and  interventional 
procedures  for  fluid  removal.  As  such,  the  risk  is  considered  acceptable  in  relation  to  the 
severity of the indication treated. 
SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the 
RMP 
Important identified risks: 
  Intracranial  haemorrhage  (e.g.,  haemorrhage  intracranial,  cerebral  haemorrhage, 
and subdural haematoma) 
Risk-benefit impact:  
As of the DLP of the initial RMP (18 December 2018), events of intracranial haemorrhage, 
including haemorrhage intracranial, cerebral haemorrhage, and subdural haematoma have 
been  reported  in  the  overall  safety  population  with  a  3%  frequency  in  the  clinical 
development  programme  for  avapritinib  (1.1%  of  all  patients  with  GIST  and  10.3%  of 
patients with AdvSM). None of the reported events were fatal at the DLP of the initial RMP 
(one patient who had intracranial bleeding died of disease progression while the event of 
intracranial  haemorrhage  was  ongoing),  but  in  almost  one  third  of  the  patients,  it  led  to 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Intracranial haemorrhage is a serious, life-threatening event, leading to dose interruptions 
when occurring with mild severity, or even permanent discontinuation of  the drug when 
occurring  with  increased  severity.  Considering  the  known  association  of  intracranial 
haemorrhage  with  other  TKIs,  including  imatinib,  and  the  seriousness  of  these  events, 
intracranial haemorrhage has a significant impact on the benefit-risk profile of avapritinib. 
Page 51 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
  Cognitive effects (e.g., memory impairment, cognitive disorders, confusional state, and 
encephalopathy) 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Cases of cognitive effects, including memory impairment, cognitive disorder, confusional 
state  and  encephalopathy  had  been  frequently  reported  in  the  clinical  development 
programme for avapritinib (36.4%) as of the DLP of the initial RMP (18 December 2018). 
However, the majority of the cognitive effects were non-serious and of low severity.  
Cognitive effects have been identified in association with other authorised TKIs (such as 
larotrectinib  and  lorlatinib),  but  the  mechanism  of  occurrence,  as  well  as  long-term 
outcomes  remain  unknown.  Considering 
in 
avapritinib-treated patients and the potential for affecting patient’s quality of life, this risk 
is considered important for the risk management. 
the  frequency  of  cognitive  effects 
  Drug-drug interactions with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The  data  from  the  non-clinical  studies  showed  that  plasma  levels  of  avapritinib  can  be 
affected when administered concomitantly with a strong CYP3A inhibitor or strong CYP3A 
inducer (refer to PART II: Module SII). The only clinical data available originated from a 
single-dose, pharmacology Study BLU-285-0104, where the overall findings indicated that 
strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers will have marked effects on the pharmacokinetics of 
avapritinib after a single oral dose. Although not observed in clinical trials, such changes in 
pharmacokinetics  of  avapritinib  might  have  potentially  significant  clinical  outcomes  in 
treated patients. 
Important potential risks: 
  Cardiac toxicity, including QT prolongation 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The  non-clinical  studies  did  not  show  any  effects  of  avapritinib  on  the  cardiovascular 
system. In the clinical Study BLU-285-1101, a small increase in the QTc interval (6.55 ms 
[(90% CI: 1.80 to 11.29)] at 300/400 mg QD clinical dose) that was not clinically relevant 
was  observed  in  a  subset  of  GIST  patients.  In  addition,  the  slope  of  the  avapritinib 
concentration-QTc  relationship  was  very  shallow:  0.007  ms  per  ng/mL  (90% CI: 
0.003 to 0.012), with a small and not statistically significant intercept of -0.2 ms (90% CI: 
-2.26 to 1.89). 
Based on preclinical data, there is no evidence of a preferential distribution of avapritinib 
in the heart to suggest any cardiovascular effect due to high local concentrations in the heart. 
However,  considering  the  existing  potential  of  mainly  multitarget  TKIs  to  cause  QT 
prolongation [96] and cardiac toxicity [93-96], cardiac toxicity, including QT prolongation 
is considered an important potential risk associated with avapritinib. 
  Embryofoetal toxicity 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Avapritinib  demonstrated  the  potential  for  developmental  toxicity  in  an  embryofoetal 
development study in pregnant rats (refer to PART II: Module SII).This is consistent with 
the  known  effects  of  TKIs  on  pregnancy  in  humans,  collected  from  the  post-marketing 
experience with these agents [92, 103].  
Page 52 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
No  data  are  available  on  the  safety  of  avapritinib  use  in  pregnant  women;  however, 
published data on imatinib use showed adverse effects on foetal development in humans. 
As pregnant women were excluded from the clinical programme for avapritinib, there are 
no  data  on  use  of  avapritinib  during  pregnancy.  Based  on  the  non-clinical  embryotoxic 
evidence and the experience with other TKIs, a risk to the pregnant woman and the foetus 
cannot be excluded.  
Missing information: 
  Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Risk-benefit impact:  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN and any AST) were 
excluded from the clinical development programme for avapritinib. Based on a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, avapritinib exposure levels in patients with mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment are similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function. However, 
given that hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for avapritinib, severe hepatic 
impairment  may  result  in  alteration  of  plasma  avapritinib  concentrations  that  cannot  be 
predicted based on available data. As such, use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
is considered missing information. 
  Drug-drug interaction with CYP3A substrates 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The  non-clinical  data  showed  that  in  vitro,  avapritinib is  a  time  dependent  inhibitor  and 
inducer  of  CYP3A.  As  such,  avapritinib  is  anticipated  to  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
CYP3A substrate drugs at clinically relevant exposure via its time dependent inhibition or 
induction of CYP3A (refer to PART II: Module SII). In the absence of any clinical data, 
these interactions and their clinical relevance represent missing information of avapritinib. 
SVII.2 
New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated 
RMP 
No  new  safety  concerns  for  avapritinib  are  proposed  with  this  RMP  update.  However,  the 
important identified and important potential risks were revised in light of the application for the 
treatment  of  ISM  in  the  EU.  Namely,  in  this  updated  RMP,  intracranial  haemorrhage  and 
cognitive effects are considered important identified risks for avapritinib in patients with GIST 
and AdvSM, and important potential risks in patients with ISM, reflecting the different safety 
profiles of avapritinib in these patient populations and recommended avapritinib doses in these 
indications (i.e., 25 mg QD for patients with ISM as compared to 200 mg QD in patients with 
AdvSM and 300 mg QD in patients with and GIST). 
Intracranial haemorrhage 
In  patients  with  AdvSM,  who  received  a  higher  starting  dose  of  200 mg  avapritinib,  severe 
thrombocytopenia  (defined  as  < 50 × 109/L)  was  identified  as  the  primary  risk  factor  for 
intracranial  haemorrhage.  Patients  with  AdvSM  are at  higher risk  of developing intracranial 
haemorrhage, considering that the underlying disease often causes haematopoietic insufficiency 
leading  to  severe  thrombocytopenia.  Therefore,  platelet  count  monitoring  and  dose 
modifications are very important measures in the setting of AdvSM and have been shown to 
reduce the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage in AdvSM clinical trials. 
No events of intracranial haemorrhage were reported during study BLU-285-2203 in patients 
with  ISM,  and  treatment  with  avapritinib  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
Page 53 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
developing thrombocytopenia. By definition, thrombocytopenia is not observed in patients with 
ISM, as this would be considered a C-finding that would be indicative of advanced disease. 
During  study  BLU-285-2203,  treatment-emergent  thrombocytopenia  was  rarely  reported  in 
patients with ISM and was only Grade 1 in severity. One patient receiving 25 mg avapritinib in 
Part 2  of  the  study  and  2 patients  in  Part 3  (both  with  prior  placebo)  had  Grade 1 
thrombocytopenia.  Shifts  in  platelet  count  decreased  (in  3.5%  of  patients  receiving  25 mg 
avapritinib and 2.8% of patients receiving placebo) were also to Grade 1 only. Additionally, 
across all study parts, the frequency and severity of shifts in platelet decrease in patients over 
time with longer exposure were similar to what was observed in Part 2 of the study. These shifts 
were transient with platelet counts returning to normal values in most of the patients. No patient 
experienced a shift to ≥Grade 2 platelet count decrease. 
It can be concluded that patients with ISM do not have baseline thrombocytopenia and when 
treated  with  25 mg  avapritinib  QD,  are  not  at  risk  of  developing  clinically  significant 
thrombocytopenia.  Therefore,  platelet  monitoring  in  this  patient  population  is  not  deemed 
necessary as a risk minimisation measure. 
Taking  the  above  considerations  into  account,  intracranial  haemorrhage  is  considered  an 
important potential risk in the ISM patient population. 
Cognitive effects 
In  study  BLU-285-2203,  treatment  with  25 mg  avapritinib  in  patients  with  ISM  was  not 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  developing  cognitive  effect  events.  These  events  were 
infrequent in both treatment groups (avapritinib and placebo) and slightly lower in the 25 mg 
avapritinib group (2.8%) compared with the placebo group (4.2%). This lower incidence in the 
avapritinib  group  suggests  that  these  events  are  most  likely  due  to  the  patients’  underlying 
disease and other treatments patients were receiving as part of their BSC. 
Cognitive effects have been observed in the clinical studies in patients with GIST and AdvSM, 
following treatment with avapritinib at higher doses. The exposure-response analyses of safety 
in patients with GIST and AdvSM showed that increased avapritinib exposure was associated 
with an increased risk of cognitive effect events. 
Taking the  above considerations  into  account,  cognitive effects  are considered an important 
potential risk in the ISM patient population. 
SVII.3 
Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
SVII.3.1.1  Important Identified Risk 1: Intracranial Haemorrhage (GIST and AdvSM) 
Potential Mechanisms:  
The mechanism by which avapritinib may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage is not 
yet  understood.  It  is  hypothesised  that  there  are  two  main  mechanisms  by  which  TKIs  may 
cause intracranial haemorrhage: 
  TKIs can alter platelet function which may predispose patients to intracranial haemorrhage 
[101]. Imatinib is believed to cause platelet dysfunction which may not be detectable by 
standard testing, leading to intracranial haemorrhage [106]. 
  The  other  postulated  aetiology  for  risk  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  is  linked  to  the 
TKIs/avapritinib’s mechanism of action, targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
Page 54 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
(PDGFR). Inhibition of PDGFRB was linked with the under-development of microvascular 
pericytes in mice, thus compromising the mechanical stability of the blood vessels [90]. 
An in-vitro assessment revealed that there were no effects of avapritinib in vitro on platelets 
isolated  from  normal  volunteers  and  platelet  aggregation  and  activation  were  unaffected  by 
treatment  with  avapritinib  at  concentrations  spanning 
the  clinically  relevant  range 
(Study 6000714). 
In the AdvSM population, severe thrombocytopenia was identified as the primary risk factor 
for intracranial haemorrhage and is further discussed below. 
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:  
This risk is based on the events of intracranial haemorrhage observed in patients treated with 
avapritinib in the clinical development programme, even though the causality evaluation of the 
events was confounded by alternative aetiologies or other risk factors. 
The non-clinical data from the avapritinib development programme showed the development 
of choroid plexus oedema in dogs with exposure margins of 4.7, 1.0, and 0.4 times the human 
exposure  at  the  25 mg,  200 mg,  and  300 mg  clinical  doses,  respectively,  as  well  as  brain 
haemorrhage in dogs with exposure margins of 9.0, 1.8, and 0.8 times the human exposure at 
the 25 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg clinical doses, respectively (refer to PART II: Module SII). 
In addition, intracranial haemorrhage was associated with use of other TKIs such as dasatinib 
or imatinib [101], including their use in patients with GIST [102, 106]. 
Lastly,  a  majority  of  AdvSM  patients  with 
thrombocytopenia, preceding or at the time of the event. 
intracranial  haemorrhage  had  severe 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
In general, intracranial haemorrhage is an important public health problem leading to marked 
mortality and morbidity [107]. However, the causes for intracranial haemorrhage differ in the 
cancer population from that in the general population as will be further discussed in the ‘Risk 
factors and risk groups’ part of this sub-section [108, 109]. 
Clinical Trials 
GIST and AdvSM 
Frequency 
In the avapritinib clinical trials, events of intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 25 patients 
(3.1%) within the overall safety population (refer to distribution of events per indication in 
Table 8).  The  incidence  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  was  2.5%  in  patients  with  AdvSM 
without pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia and treated at a starting dose of 200 mg QD.

Severity, Reversibility, and Long-Term Outcomes 
GIST 
In the GIST patient group, subdural haematoma was reported in 5 patients (< 1%). Grade 1 
subdural haematoma was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient each reported Grade 2, Grade 3, 
and  Grade 4  subdural  haematoma.  In  3 patients,  the  events  of  subdural  haematoma  were 
assessed as serious. In 3 patients, the events of subdural haematoma were assessed as related 
to avapritinib. 
A total of 6 patients (< 1%) had events of haemorrhage intracranial. Grade 1 haemorrhage 
intracranial was reported in 2 patients, Grade 2 in 1 patient, Grade 3 in 1 patient, and Grade 4 
in  2 patients.  In  4 patients,  the  events  of  haemorrhage  intracranial  were  serious.  In  all 
6 patients, the haemorrhage intracranial events were assessed as related to avapritinib. One 
patient had two events (subdural haematoma and haemorrhage intracranial). 
A  total  of  3 patients  (< 1%)  had  events  of  cerebral  haemorrhage.  Grade 3  cerebral 
haemorrhage was reported in 2 patients and Grade 4 in 1 patient, and all were serious. In all 
3 patients, the events of cerebral haemorrhage were assessed as related to avapritinib. 
Events of intracranial haemorrhage (all grades) occurred in a range from 8 weeks to 84 weeks 
after initiating avapritinib, with a median time to onset of 22 weeks.  
Avapritinib  treatment  was  permanently discontinued in 7 patients  with GIST  (1.1%)  with 
intracranial  haemorrhage  events  (3 patients  with  cerebral  haemorrhage,  2 patients  with 
subdural haematoma, and 2 patients with haemorrhage intracranial) and it was temporarily 
interrupted  in  4 patients  (< 1%)  (2 patients  with  subdural  haematoma  and  2 patients  with 
haemorrhage intracranial). 
The  ≥Grade 2  intracranial  haemorrhage  events  were  reported  as  resolved  in  6 patients 
(1.0%), resolved with sequelae in 3 patients (< 1%), and ongoing in 1 patient (< 1%). None 
of the intracranial haemorrhage events in the GIST patient group were fatal. The median time 
to improvement and resolution was 25 weeks for intracranial haemorrhage of ≥ Grade 2.

Confounding  factors  were  reported  in  11  of  13 patients  with  GIST  with  intracranial 
haemorrhage  events  and  included  history  of  hypertension  in  9 patients,  angiopathies  in 
2 patients,  brain  structural/vascular  abnormalities  (e.g., cavernous  haemangiomas  or 
cavernous arteriovenous fistula) in 4 patients, likely head trauma in 2 patients, and aspirin 
use in 1 patient. 
AdvSM 
In the AdvSM patient group, subdural haematoma was reported in 7 patients (3.6%). Grade 1 
subdural haematoma was reported in 4 patients and 1 patient each had Grade 2, Grade 3, and 
Grade 4 subdural haematoma. In 6 patients, the events of subdural haematoma were assessed 
as  serious.  In  5 patients,  the  events  of  subdural  haematoma  were  assessed  as  related  to 
avapritinib. 
A total of 5 patients (2.6%) had events of haemorrhage intracranial. Grade 1 haemorrhage 
intracranial was reported in 1 patient, Grade 2 in 2 patients, Grade 3 in 1 patient, and Grade 5 
in 1 patient. In 4 patients, the events of haemorrhage intracranial were serious. In 4 patients, 
the haemorrhage intracranial events were assessed as related to avapritinib. One serious event 
of haemorrhage intracranial was Grade 5 in severity and assessed as related to avapritinib. 
This fatal event occurred in an elderly patient with SM-myelodysplastic syndrome as a result 
of  prior  head  trauma  and  in  the  setting  of  severe  thrombocytopenia  (platelet  count  on 
admission: 40 × 109/L; normal range 130-400 [units not specified]). 
No  events  of  cerebral  haemorrhage  were  reported  in  patients  with  AdvSM  in  the  clinical 
trials with avapritinib. 
Events  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  (all  grades)  occurred  in  a  range  from  12.0 weeks  to 
15.0 weeks after initiating avapritinib, with a median time to onset of 12.1 weeks. 
Avapritinib treatment was permanently discontinued in 6 patients with AdvSM (3.1%) with 
intracranial  haemorrhage  events  (3 patients  with  haemorrhage  intracranial  and  3 patients 
with subdural haematoma) and was temporarily interrupted in 4 patients (2.1%) (3 patients 
with subdural haematoma and 1 patient with haemorrhage intracranial). 
The events that resulted in temporary interruption and restarting at a reduced dose and those 
that resulted in no change in study drug dosing occurred prior to the protocol amendment 
that  required  permanent  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  the  setting  of  intracranial 
haemorrhage of any severity. 
The ≥Grade 2 intracranial haemorrhage events were reported as resolved in 5 patients (2.6%) 
and as resolved with sequelae in 1 patient. One of the intracranial haemorrhage events was 
fatal as described above. 
Confounding  factors  were  reported  in  all  12 patients  with  AdvSM  with  intracranial 
haemorrhage events and included severe thrombocytopenia preceding or at the time of the 
event  in  10 patients,  history  of  hypertension  in  6 patients,  concurrent  use  of  aspirin  in 
2 patients, prior falls with head trauma in 2 patients, history of coagulopathy in 1 patient, 
history of alcohol abuse, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and an increased international 
normalisation ratio in 1 patient. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Intracranial haemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening event which may lead to or prolong 
hospitalisation, residual neurological damage or may even result in death.

Post-Authorisation Experience (Data Lock Point of 08 July 2022) 
A comprehensive analysis of data collected during the post-marketing experience in patients 
with GIST and AdvSM does not indicate a change in the characterisation of the risk. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Intracranial haemorrhage occurs in 7% of patients with cancer, and subdural haematoma has 
been  estimated  to  account  for  26%  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  found  at  autopsy  in  this 
population of patients [109].  
Intracranial haemorrhage accounts for nearly one half of all cerebrovascular events in cancer 
patients, but the risk factors vary between types of cancer [108]. Intracranial haemorrhage is 
common in haematological malignancies or in the presence of brain metastases. However, brain 
metastases are extremely rare in GIST [4] and only 16 cases of brain metastases in patients with 
GIST were reported in the literature until 2014 [1]. 
Events of subdural haematoma in patients with GIST treated with imatinib were reported in the 
literature  [102,  106]  in  the  absence  of  other  obvious  causes  such  as  head  trauma,  brain 
metastases,  thrombocytopenia  or  anticoagulation  which  represent  the  most  common  general 
risk factors for such events, and the suspected cause was imatinib-related platelet dysfunction. 
It has been estimated that the rate of imatinib-related intracranial haemorrhage in the absence 
of other obvious causes may be between 1.9 and 5.7% [106]. 
Thrombocytopenia  is  a  known  risk  factor  for  bleeding  events,  including  intracranial 
haemorrhage. In patients with GIST, thrombocytopenia AEs were observed at a low frequency 
(18 patients; 3.0%). Grade 1 thrombocytopenia was reported in 16 patients, and Grade 2 and 
Grade 3 in 1 patient each. However, thrombocytopenia AEs were reported in more than a third 
of the patients with AdvSM (77 patients; 39.9%) and in more than a half of these patients, the 
thrombocytopenia AEs were ≥Grade 3 in severity (43 of 77 patients; 56%). 
Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 × 109/L) was identified as the primary risk factor 
for intracranial haemorrhage in AdvSM. Prior to or at the time of the intracranial haemorrhage 
events,  10  of  the  12 patients  with  AdvSM  with  intracranial  haemorrhage  had  severe 
thrombocytopenia  with  platelet  counts  below  50 × 109/L,  and  2 patients  had  mild 
thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between less than lower limit of normal and 75 × 109/L) at 
the time of the event. 
As  severe  thrombocytopenia  is  a  known  complication  associated  with  AdvSM,  due  to  bone 
marrow  infiltration  by  MCs,  this  likely  explains  the  higher  frequency  of  intracranial 
haemorrhage  seen  in  patients  with  AdvSM  compared  with  patients  with  GIST  treated  with 
avapritinib. 
In addition to severe thrombocytopenia prior to or at the time of the intracranial haemorrhage, 
a review of case reports of patients with intracranial haemorrhage events identified several other 
potential  risk  factors  for  such  events  including  the  use  of  concomitant  anti-platelet  or 
anti-thrombotic therapy any time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of last 
dose  of  avapritinib + 30 days,  inclusive;  elevated  international  normalised  ratio  prior  to the 
intracranial  haemorrhage  event;  elevated  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  prior  to  the 
intracranial haemorrhage event; and avapritinib starting dose > 200 mg QD. 
A  multivariate  logistic  regression  model  to  evaluate  the  association  between  intracranial 
haemorrhage  and  each  of  these  5 potential  risk  factors  identified  severe  thrombocytopenia 
(platelet counts < 50 × 109/L) as the only statistically significant risk factor (p-value: 0.0292) 
for intracranial haemorrhage in the AdvSM population.

Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Risk mitigation strategies were implemented for all AdvSM patients to minimise the risk for 
intracranial haemorrhage. These measures included exclusion of patients with a platelet count 
< 50 × 109/L  at  baseline,  monitoring  of  platelet  count  at  every  treatment  cycle,  detailed 
guidance on dose modification, and defining the starting dose of avapritinib to be 200 mg QD. 
Additionally,  to  mitigate against  a  second bleed, protocols  were amended  such  that patients 
who experienced an intracranial haemorrhage of any toxicity grade permanently discontinued 
avapritinib  treatment.  With  these  risk  minimisation  measures  the  current  intracranial 
haemorrhage incidence is 2.5% in patients with AdvSM who did not have pre-existing severe 
thrombocytopenia and were treated at a starting dose of 200 mg QD. 
Preventability: 
Due  to  the  potential  link  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  avapritinib,  the  risk  of  intracranial 
haemorrhage may not be entirely preventable, but the incidence may be reduced if patients with 
risk factors are not treated with avapritinib and if risk factors emerging during treatment are 
managed  appropriately.  Severe  thrombocytopenia  is  a  significant  risk  factor  for  intracranial 
haemorrhage, and in case of occurrence, it is expected to be managed through dose interruptions 
and  corrected  by  platelet  support.  Furthermore, 
intracranial 
haemorrhage, the outcome may be improved if diagnosis is made early. 
in  patients  developing 
Before  initiating  avapritinib  at  any  dose  the  risk  for  intracranial  haemorrhage  should  be 
carefully considered in patients with potential increased risk including those with a history of 
vascular aneurysm, intracranial haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident within the prior year, 
concomitant use of anticoagulants or thrombocytopenia. Other factors that may contribute to 
the  risk  of  haemorrhage  events  at  an  individual  patient  level  should  also  be  considered, 
including history of coagulopathy, prolonged international normalised ratio, and concomitant 
use of medicinal products that increase the risk of haemorrhage. Physical examination, blood 
counts, and coagulation parameters should be monitored in order to reduce the risk of severe 
haemorrhage events during treatment with avapritinib. 
In  patients  with  AdvSM,  platelet  count  must  be  performed  prior  to  initiating  therapy. 
Avapritinib is not recommended in patients with severely low platelet counts (< 50 × 109/L). 
Following treatment initiation, platelet counts must be performed every 2 weeks for the first 
8 weeks regardless of baseline platelet count. After 8 weeks of treatment, platelet counts should 
be monitored every 2 weeks (or more frequently as clinically indicated) if values are less than 
75 × 109/L, every 4 weeks if values are between 75 and 100 × 109/L, and as clinically indicated 
if values are ≥100 × 109/L. 
In  case  of  severe  thrombocytopenia  (< 50 × 109/L)  occurring  during  avapritinib  treatment, 
avapritinib should be withheld until platelet counts are ≥ 50 × 109/L. Platelet support may be 
necessary. Appropriate diagnostic evaluations (e.g., neuroimaging) should be performed at the 
first sign or symptom suggestive of intracranial haemorrhage, regardless of the severity at the 
initial  presentation.  Patients  who  experience  clinically  relevant  neurological  signs  and 
symptoms  (e.g.,  severe  headache,  vision  problems,  somnolence,  or  focal  weakness)  during 
treatment with avapritinib should interrupt dosing of avapritinib and immediately inform their 
treating physician. Treating physicians should have a low threshold for ordering diagnostic tests 
in patients presenting with relevant complaints. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
computed tomography (CT) is recommended in cases of suspected intracranial haemorrhage. 
Avapritinib  should  be  permanently  discontinued  in  any  patient  experiencing  an  intracranial 
haemorrhage, regardless of severity. Patients with suspected intracranial haemorrhage should 
withhold treatment until the appropriate diagnostic evaluations are performed.

Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
While  the  overall  incidence  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  events  in  GIST  patients  was  low 
(2.1%), it was higher in AdvSM patients (6.2%), mainly due to an increased incidence of severe 
thrombocytopenia in the latter patient population. In line with that, the incidence of intracranial 
haemorrhage was 2.5% in AdvSM patients without pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia and 
treated at a starting dose of 200 mg QD. In general, intracranial haemorrhage events observed 
in the clinical development program for avapritinib were reversible and Grade 3 or lower in 
severity. Thirteen out of the 25 patients that experienced intracranial haemorrhage permanently 
discontinued the drug. 
Close monitoring of patients for clinical signs of intracranial haemorrhage as part of routine 
clinical practice and regular platelet monitoring is expected to allow for  early diagnosis and 
intervention,  thus  improving  the  outcomes  of  these  events  and  minimising  the  impact  on 
patients. 
Based on a thorough review of the clinical data and taking into consideration the poor prognosis, 
high mortality, and unmet need in patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic GIST or 
with AdvSM, the risk of intracranial haemorrhage associated with exposure to avapritinib is 
considered acceptable and outweighed by the anticipated benefits of avapritinib therapy.

SVII.3.1.2  Important Identified Risk 2: Cognitive Effects (GIST and AdvSM) 
Potential Mechanism: 
The  mechanism  by  which  avapritinib  may  cause  cognitive  effects  is  not  known.  Cognitive 
effects  in  patients  from  the  avapritinib  development  programme  were  not  associated  with 
structural changes in the brain that would potentially explain their aetiology. 
Non-clinical  mechanistic  studies  of  memory  impairment  were  conducted.  Parameters  of 
short-term memory assessment were unaffected by treatment with avapritinib in rats. In mice, 
however, avapritinib treatment resulted in reduction in short term memory as assessed by the 
novel object recognition test. The effect of avapritinib on the blood brain barrier has not been 
specifically studied in non-clinical studies. However, a possible effect on the integrity of the 
blood  brain  barrier  can  be  inferred  from  choroid  plexus  oedema  noted  in  dogs  treated  with 
avapritinib  and  from  the  mechanistic  hypothesis  of  inhibition  of  PDGFRB  which  regulates 
pericyte function; pericytes maintain the integrity of the vasculature as well as the blood brain 
barrier (refer to PART II: Module SII). 
Cognitive impairment has been described in patients with a variety of cancers, independent of 
the chemotherapeutic agent administered, the stage of the disease or the stage of the therapeutic 
protocol [110]. Studies  suggest  that up to 33% of patients  exhibit  some  degree of  cognitive 
deficiency prior to any chemotherapy, including impairments in verbal learning and memory 
function  [111],  reaction  time  and  global  cognitive  function  [112].  This  indicates  a  potential 
mechanism  which  is  not  dependent  on  the  chemotherapeutic  agent.  Similarly,  in  SM, 
neuropsychiatric  disturbances,  including  memory  impairment,  anxiety,  and  depression,  have 
been observed [37, 57]. 
Other  potential  mechanisms  that  could  explain  the  development  of  cognitive  impairment  in 
cancer  patients  have  been  hypothesized,  based  on  the  pharmacological  activity  of  some 
chemotherapeutic  agents.  Cognitive  changes  through  deoxyribonucleic  acid  damage  and 
increases in oxidative stress, as well as cytokine deregulation and inflammatory processes can 
Page 60 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
contribute  to  occurrence  of  cancer-related  cognitive  impairment  [113,  114].  However,  as  in 
most  cases  this  is  a  direct  consequence  of  a  specific  mechanism  of  action  of  an  individual 
chemotherapeutic agent, this aetiology may not be pertinent for avapritinib. 
Anxiety,  depression,  and  confusion  have  been  seen  with  PI3K  inhibitors,  particularly  with 
buparlisib [115, 116]. Neuropsychiatric effects such as anxiety and depression were seen in up 
to one-third of patients receiving buparlisib, with Grade 3 or higher confusion seen in up to 
10% [117]. 
Alternatively, certain genetic factors can provide an explanation which is independent of the 
chemotherapeutic agent. Variability in genes that regulate neural repair or plasticity, such as 
apolipoprotein E  and  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor,  and  neurotransmission,  such  as 
catechol-O-methyltransferase, have been shown to increase the vulnerability of cancer patients 
to cognitive changes [113, 114].  
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence:  
This  risk  is  based  on  the  events  of  cognitive  effects  (e.g.,  memory  impairment,  cognitive 
disorder, confusional state, amnesia, somnolence, speech disorder, encephalopathy, delirium, 
mental impairment, hallucination, mood altered, agitation, disorientation, personality change, 
dementia,  mental  status  change,  and  psychotic  disorder)  observed  with  high  frequency  in 
subjects exposed to avapritinib in the clinical development programme for GIST and AdvSM. 
In  addition,  cognitive  effects  have  been  identified  in  association  with  other  TKIs  such  as 
larotrectinib [118] and lorlatinib [119].

Severity, Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes 
In terms of severity, 24.6% of patients with GIST (all doses; N=610) experienced Grade 1 
cognitive effects (predominantly events of memory impairment [15.4%]), with 13.6%, 3.9%, 
and  1%  of  patients  experiencing  Grade 2,  Grade 3,  and  Grade 4  cognitive  effects, 
respectively. No patients experienced Grade 5 cognitive effects. 
Similarly,  most  patients  with  AdvSM  (all  doses;  N=193)  experienced  Grade 1  cognitive 
effects (18.1%; predominantly events of memory impairment [11.9%]), and 8.8% and 3.6% 
of  patients  experienced  Grade 2  and  Grade 3  cognitive  effects,  respectively.  No  patients 
experienced Grade 4 or Grade 5 cognitive effects. 
Serious AEs of cognitive effects were reported for 3.6% of patients within the overall safety 
population (all indications, all doses, N=803). The majority of the serious cognitive effects 
in both indications were Grade 3 (in 2.4% of patients) and assessed as related to avapritinib 
(in 2.2% of patients).  
Twenty-four  patients  with  GIST  (3.9%)  and  5 patients  with  AdvSM  (2.6%)  experienced 
serious  AEs  of  cognitive  effects.  Approximately  a  half  of  the  serious  events  resolved  or 
resolved with sequelae.

Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
In the avapritinib clinical trials (all indications, all doses, N=803), the majority of patients 
with  cognitive  effects  continued  dosing  with  avapritinib  with  only  3.0%  of  patients 
experiencing  cognitive  effects  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment 
(3.1%  and  2.6%  of  patients  with  GIST  and  AdvSM,  respectively)  and  13.1%  of  patients 
interrupting  the  study  treatment  (14.1%  and  9.8%  of  patients  with  GIST  and  AdvSM, 
respectively). This observation indicates that the cognitive effects appeared to be tolerated 
by the patients and that physicians believe the benefit-risk balance of avapritinib was positive 
and recommended continued treatment. 
Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to assess the probability of experiencing a cognitive 
effect  at  a  certain  point  in  time,  and  the  time  window  needed  for  improvement. 
Approximately half of patients treated with avapritinib are expected to have an event by the 
40th week of treatment. The probability of experiencing a cognitive effect increases over the 
first  1.5 year  of  treatment  and  then  reaches  a  plateau.  The  median  time  to  onset  among 
patients who experienced a cognitive effect of any grade was 8.4 weeks in GIST (all doses; 
N=249),  13.3 weeks  in  AdvSM  (all  doses;  N=42),  and  8.9 weeks  in  the  overall  safety 
population (all doses; N=291). 
For patients with GIST and AdvSM who experienced a  cognitive effect of ≥Grade 2, the 
probability  of  improvement  to  Grade ≤1  was  high  (approximately  80%).  Focusing  on 
patients with GIST whose starting dose was 300/400 mg and who experienced a ≥Grade 2 
cognitive effect, the probability of improvement to ≤Grade 1 was 80% at 28 weeks after the 
event onset; the median time to improvement to ≤Grade 1 was 7.9 weeks. In patients with 
AdvSM whose starting dose was 200 mg and who experienced a ≥Grade 2 cognitive effect, 
the probability of improvement to ≤Grade 1 was 50% at 24.1 weeks and 75% by 24.1 weeks 
after the event onset; the median time to improvement to ≤Grade 1 was 24.1 weeks. 
In many cases, the events of cognitive effects started as Grade 1 in severity and worsened to 
higher grades over time, with dose interruption or reduction not occurring until the event 
was Grade 2 or worse. 
Cognitive effects were not associated with structural changes in the brain. Forty-four patients 
with GIST experienced cognitive effect events during the first 3 cycles of treatment with 
avapritinib when routine monthly brain imaging was performed. Among those 44 patients, 
42 had brain imaging at baseline and none had a new abnormality compared to the baseline 
imaging. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Of the patients experiencing cognitive effects, 24.6% of patients with GIST and 18.1% of 
patients with AdvSM experienced Grade 1 (mild) cognitive effects, which according to the 
CTCAE definition do not interfere with activities of daily living. 
In general, cognitive effects of Grade 2 in severity may lead to impairment of quality of life 
and represent a risk factor for accidents and injuries. However, just 13.6% of patients with 
GIST and 8.8% of patients with AdvSM experienced Grade 2 cognitive  effects, and only 
3.9% of patients with GIST and 3.6% of patients with AdvSM experienced Grade 3 cognitive 
effects,  defined  as  limiting  self-care.  Grade 4  (life  threatening)  cognitive  effects  were 
reported  in  < 1%  patients  with  GIST  and  no  patients  with  AdvSM.  No  patients  reported 
Grade 5 (fatal) cognitive effects. 
Post-Authorisation Experience (Data Lock Point of 08 July 2022) 
A comprehensive analysis of data collected during the post marketing experience in patients 
with GIST and AdvSM does not indicate a change in the characterisation of the risk.

Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Several risk  factors and risk groups prone to develop cognitive effects have been identified, 
based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of available data. These include increased age, 
medical history of cognitive effects, together with polypharmacy and use of CNS medications, 
increased avapritinib dosage, and other concurrent pathologies or disease progression. 
Analyses of patients in the overall GIST and AdvSM safety population (N = 803) showed that 
the incidence of cognitive effects was slightly higher in patients aged ≥65 years compared with 
patients aged < 65 years (42.4% vs 38.1%). This difference is not unexpected because cognitive 
issues  are  known  to  increase  with  age  [120].  Furthermore,  this  is  in  accordance  with  other 
studies  that  found  similar  correlation  between  the  age  of  the  patient  and  development  of 
cognitive effects while undergoing anti-cancer therapy [121].  
In the GIST and AdvSM safety population, there appeared to be a slightly higher incidence of 
cognitive effects in female compared to male patients (44.9 vs. 37.2%) and in white compared 
to non-white patients (41.4% vs 36.8%).  
The incidence of events of cognitive effects in patients with GIST and AdvSM was higher in 
patients from North America compared with patients from Europe or Australia and Asia (51.5% 
vs 31.2% and 31.9%, respectively). This difference appears to be driven by a higher incidence 
of events of memory impairment in North American patients compared with patients from the 
above regions (31.1% vs 10.7% and 14.2%, respectively). The cause of this observation is not 
clear.  
The incidence of cognitive effects was also found to be higher in patients with prior regorafenib 
use compared with patients with no regorafenib use in the GIST population.  
Other variables that did not appear to show a significant impact on the incidence of cognitive 
effects in the GIST and AdvSM safety population included prior number of TKI therapies and 
total duration of prior TKI therapy. 
A multivariable logistic regression analysis performed for cognitive effects of any grade in the 
GIST and AdvSM safety population showed that the odds of experiencing a cognitive effect 
were increased by a multiplier of 167% if a patient had medical history of cognitive effects. 
This is in accordance with publications indicating that the level of cognitive reserve prior to 
treatment  plays  a  role  in  development  of  cognitive  effects  during  anti-cancer  therapy  [121]. 
This  refers  to  the  innate  and  developed  cognitive  capacity,  which  is  influenced  by  various 
factors,  including  genetics,  education,  occupational  attainment,  and  lifestyle.  Results  of  one 
longitudinal  study  showed  that  patients  who  had  lower  pre-treatment  cognitive  reserve 
performed  worse  on  measures  of  Processing  Speed  compared  with  patients  not  exposed  to 
chemotherapy  and  healthy  controls  [121].  As  such,  patients  with  higher  baseline  cognitive 
performance may have more cushion against cognitive detriments than individuals with a lower 
baseline cognitive performance. 
Preventability: 
Guidelines for management of oncology geriatric patients recommend several supportive care 
interventions  for  alleviating  cognitive  impairment,  which  can  be  routinely  used  in  everyday 
medical  management  of  cancer  patients.  These  include  caregiver  involvement,  minimising 
complexity  of  treatment  and  medications,  delirium  prevention,  social  work  involvement, 
capacity  assessment,  health-care  proxy  identification,  and  additional  cognitive  testing  or 
neuropsychological  assessment  [122].  Actual  management  of  cognitive  effects  can  be  done 
through non-pharmacologic interventions that include exercise and physical activity, as well as 
cognitive trainings. A small number of studies showed that some pharmacologic agents can be 
Page 64 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
used for management of cognitive effects, but no recommendation can be made in this respect 
[123]. 
For patients under treatment with avapritinib who experience signs and symptoms of cognitive 
effects, different managing strategies are recommended, based on the severity of the adverse 
reactions.  
Patients experiencing events of Grade 1 in severity should continue at the same or reduced dose 
or interrupt until improvement to baseline or resolution and resume at the same or reduced dose. 
If events of Grade 2 or 3 in severity occur, treatment with avapritinib should be interrupted until 
improvement to baseline, Grade 1 or complete resolution. Therapy can be resumed at the same 
dose  or  at  a  reduced  dose.  Patients  experiencing  cognitive  effects  of  Grade 4  should 
permanently discontinue treatment with avapritinib. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Cases  of  cognitive  effects  have  been  reported  with  increased  frequency  within  the  clinical 
development programme of avapritinib. However, the AEs of cognitive effects have not been 
associated with any fatal outcomes, the majority of which were of Grade 1 severity which did 
not affect patient’s quality of life and allowed for continuation of therapy.  
For  events  of Grade ≥2  in  severity, clinical measures such as  dose  reductions and  treatment 
interruptions  were  shown  effective  for  improvements.  Data  from  the  clinical  development 
programmes indicate that the cognitive effects appeared to be tolerated by patients and accepted 
by  physicians,  as  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  continued  treatment  with  avapritinib  remains 
positive.  As  such,  the  risk  of  cognitive  effects  associated  with  exposure  to  avapritinib  is 
considered acceptable. 
Public Health Impact: 
Not applicable. 
SVII.3.1.3  Important Identified Risk 3: Drug-Drug Interactions with Moderate or Strong 
CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers (All Indications) 
Potential Mechanisms:  
In-vitro  studies  showed  that  avapritinib  phase I  metabolism  is  predominantly  mediated  by 
CYP3A4 and is a time dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. As such, the plasma levels 
of  avapritinib  or  comedication  that  is  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A  inhibitor/inducer  can  be 
affected, and co-administration of such medication with avapritinib may lead to increased risks 
of adverse effects or decreased efficacy. 
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:  
The  data  from  the  non-clinical  studies  showed  that  in  vitro,  avapritinib  is  predominantly 
metabolised  by  CYP3A,  and  thus,  plasma  levels  of  avapritinib  can  be  affected  when 
administered  concomitantly with  a  moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer (refer  to 
PART  II:  Module  SII).  The  only  clinical  data  available  originated  from  the  single-dose, 
pharmacology  Study  BLU-285-0104  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers,  which  showed  that 
plasma exposure of avapritinib was modulated in the presence of the strong CYP3A4 inducer 
rifampicin and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole. 
The clinical outcomes of such effects and the overall impact on patients treated with avapritinib 
remains unknown.

Severity 
Not yet established for avapritinib in any patient population (i.e., GIST, AdvSM, and ISM). 
In general, the outcomes of DDIs between avapritinib and CYP3A inhibitors/inducers can 
range from asymptomatic changes in pharmacokinetics of the drug to clinically meaningful 
outcomes, including increased incidence and/or severity of adverse  effects  and decreased 
efficacy of avapritinib therapy. 
Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes 
The effects of CYP3A inhibitors/inducers on avapritinib plasma levels are expected to be 
fully reversed upon discontinuation of the perpetrator drugs. 
The  long-term  outcomes  are  not  yet  established  for  avapritinib  in  any  patient  population 
(i.e., GIST, AdvSM, and ISM). 
Impact on Quality of Life 
The  clinically  meaningful  outcomes  of  DDIs  could  have  a  marked  impact  on  patients, 
especially if leading to increased severity of adverse effects or decreased efficacy. 
Post-Authorisation Experience (Data Lock Point of 08 July 2022) 
A comprehensive analysis of data collected during the post marketing experience in patients 
with GIST and AdvSM does not indicate a change in the characterisation of the risk. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
No specific risk factors or risk groups have yet been established for avapritinib in any patient 
population (i.e., GIST, AdvSM, and ISM). 
Preventability: 
For patients with GIST and AdvSM, concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate 
CYP3A  inhibitors  should  be  avoided.  If  concomitant  use  with  a  moderate  CYP3A  inhibitor 
cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib should be reduced from 300 mg orally QD 
to 100 mg orally QD for patients with GIST and from 200 mg orally QD to 50 mg orally QD 
for patients with AdvSM. 
For  patients  with  ISM,  concomitant  use  of  avapritinib  with  strong  or  moderate  CYP3A 
inhibitors must be avoided. 
Co-administration of avapritinib with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided 
in all patient populations. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
The  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  from  a  single-dose  healthy  volunteer  study  showed  that 
plasma levels of avapritinib can be affected by co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor 
or  inducer.  Although  not  observed  in  clinical  trials,  the  changes  in  pharmacokinetics  of 
avapritinib might have potentially serious clinical outcomes in treated patients.

SVII.3.1.4  Important Potential Risk 1: Intracranial Haemorrhage (ISM) 
Potential Mechanisms:  
The  mechanism  of  action  by  which  avapritinib  may  predispose  patients  to  intracranial 
haemorrhage is unknown.  
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence: 
No intracranial haemorrhages were reported in patients with ISM receiving avapritinib in the 
clinical development programme. However, intracranial haemorrhage represents a known risk 
for  avapritinib  in  patients  with  GIST  and  AdvSM  and  has  been  observed  in  these  patient 
populations  treated  with  avapritinib  at  the  higher  starting doses  of 300 mg and  200 mg QD, 
respectively, with severe thrombocytopenia identified as the primary risk factor in patients with 
AdvSM (refer to SVII.3.1.1).  
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials 
ISM 
Frequency 
No intracranial haemorrhage events were reported in avapritinib-treated patients in the ISM 
safety population (all doses; N = 246). 
Severity 
No intracranial haemorrhage events were reported in the avapritinib clinical development 
programme in patients with ISM. 
Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes 
No intracranial haemorrhage events were reported in the avapritinib clinical development 
programme in patients with ISM. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Intracranial haemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening event which may lead to or prolong 
hospitalisation,  residual  neurological  damage  or  may  even  result  in  death.  However, 
considering the characteristics of ISM and the recommended avapritinib dose of 25 mg QD, 
events of intracranial haemorrhage are not expected to occur in the ISM patient population. 
Post-Authorisation Experience (Data Lock Point of 08 July 2022) 
Not yet applicable in the ISM patient population. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Not yet established in the ISM patient population.  
Preventability: 
Due to the fact that the mechanism of action of avapritinib predisposing patients to intracranial 
haemorrhage is unknown, the risk of intracranial haemorrhage may not be entirely preventable. 
Severe thrombocytopenia is  a significant risk factor for intracranial haemorrhage in patients 
with AdvSM, and in case of occurrence, it is expected to be managed through dose interruptions 
Page 67 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
and  corrected  by  platelet  support.  However,  patients  with  ISM  do  not  have  baseline 
thrombocytopenia and based on the available clinical data, when treated with 25 mg avapritinib 
QD, are not at risk of developing thrombocytopenia. Therefore, routine platelet monitoring in 
this patient population is not deemed necessary. 
Before  initiating  avapritinib  at  any  dose  the  risk  for  intracranial  haemorrhage  should  be 
carefully considered in patients with potential increased risk including those with a history of 
vascular aneurysm, intracranial haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident within the prior year, 
concomitant  use  of  anticoagulants  or  thrombocytopenia.  Patients  who  experience  clinically 
relevant  neurological  signs  and  symptoms  during  treatment  with  avapritinib  must  interrupt 
dosing of avapritinib and inform their healthcare professional immediately. Brain imaging by 
MRI  or  CT  may  be  performed  at  the  discretion  of  the  physician  based  on  severity  and  the 
clinical presentation. 
Avapritinib  should  be  permanently  discontinued  in  any  patient  experiencing  an  intracranial 
haemorrhage, regardless of severity. Patients with suspected intracranial haemorrhage should 
withhold treatment until the appropriate diagnostic evaluations are performed. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
There have been no intracranial haemorrhage events in patients with ISM and treatment with 
avapritinib was not associated with an increased risk of developing thrombocytopenia in this 
patient  population  in  the  clinical  development  programme  for  avapritinib.  Additionally, 
thrombocytopenia is not observed in patients with ISM, as this would be considered a C-finding 
that would be indicative of advanced disease.  
There are no approved therapies for this patient population and current treatment consists of 
symptom-directed  therapies  that  do  not  address  the  underlying  cause  of  ISM.  As  a  result, 
patients suffer from life-long debilitating symptoms that adversely affect their quality of life. 
In  light  of  the  currently  available  data,  patients  with  ISM  are  not  anticipated  to  develop 
intracranial haemorrhage. Given the efficacy observed in this target population and the potential 
risk  for  experiencing  intracranial  haemorrhage,  the  impact  on  the  benefit-risk  balance  of 
avapritinib is acceptable. 
Public Health Impact: 
Not applicable. 
SVII.3.1.5  Important Potential Risk 2: Cognitive Effects (ISM) 
Potential Mechanisms: 
The mechanism by which avapritinib may cause cognitive effects is not known.  
Patients with ISM typically have a higher incidence of neurocognitive symptoms related to the 
underlying disease [70] compared to the general population.  
High  prevalence  of  morphological  and  functional  brain  abnormalities  (mainly  abnormal 
punctuated  white  matter  abnormalities)  with  neuropsychiatric  complaints  have  also  been 
observed in this patient population [124]. 
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:  
Cognitive effects were reported at a low frequency in patients receiving avapritinib in patients 
with ISM in Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203, and the frequency was slightly lower in the 25 mg 
avapritinib  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  In  this  study,  treatment  with  25 mg 
Page 68 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
avapritinib  in  patients  with  ISM  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  developing 
cognitive effect events. 
However, cognitive effects represent a known risk for avapritinib in patients with GIST and 
AdvSM and have been observed in these patient populations treated with avapritinib at higher 
doses, despite that the causality of the events was confounded by alternative aetiologies or other 
risk factors (refer to SVII.3.1.2). 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials 
ISM 
Frequency 
In Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203 (avapritinib 25 mg, N = 141; placebo, N = 71), cognitive 
effect  AEs  were  overall  infrequent  in  the  25 mg  avapritinib  and  placebo  groups.  The 
incidence  of  cognitive  effect  AEs  was  slightly  lower  in  the  25 mg  avapritinib  group 
(4 patients  [2.8%])  than  in  the  placebo  group  (3 patients  [4.2%]).  The  most  commonly 
reported event was memory impairment, in 2 patients (1.4%) in the 25 mg avapritinib group 
and 1 patient (1.4%) in the placebo group. Amnesia and mood altered occurred in 1 patient 
(0.7%)  each  in  the  25 mg  avapritinib  group,  and  mental  impairment  and  mental  status 
changes occurred in 1 patient (1.4%) each in the placebo group (Table 10). 
In  the  overall  safety  population  (all  doses;  N = 246),  16 (6.5%)  of  all  avapritinib-treated 
patients experienced cognitive effects. The most common event was memory impairment in 
7 patients (2.8%) (Table 10).

Severity, Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes 
In Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203 (avapritinib 25 mg, N = 141; placebo, N = 71), most of the 
cognitive  effects  AEs  were  Grade 1  in  severity  in  the  25 mg  avapritinib  group  with  only 
1 patient experiencing a Grade 2 AE (memory impairment). In the placebo group, 1 patient 
experienced a Grade 3 event, which was reported as serious (mental status changes); all other 
events were reported as Grade 1 events. None of the events led to study drug discontinuation 
in either treatment group, whereas 1 patient in each group experienced events leading to dose 
reduction.  
In  the  overall  safety  population  (all  doses;  N = 246),  ≥ Grade 3  cognitive  effects  were 
reported  in  2 patients  (< 1%)  (delirium  [serious]  and  cognitive  disorder)  receiving  higher 
doses of avapritinib (50 and 100 mg, respectively). A serious AE of delirium that occurred 
in a patient receiving 50 mg avapritinib, led to study drug discontinuation. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Based on the available data from study BLU-285-2203, treatment with 25 mg avapritinib is 
not associated with an increased risk of cognitive effects in patients with ISM. Of the patients 
with ISM experiencing cognitive effects, most experienced Grade 1 (mild) cognitive effects, 
which according to the CTCAE definition do not interfere with activities of daily living. 
In general, cognitive effects of Grade 2 in severity may lead to impairment of quality of 
life and represent a risk factor for accidents and injuries. However, < 1% of patients with 
ISM  in  the  25 mg  avapritinib  group  experienced  Grade 2  cognitive  effects  and  none 
experienced  Grade 3  cognitive  effects,  defined  as  limiting  self-care.  No  Grade 4 
(life-threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) cognitive effects were reported.

Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
No specific risk factors or risk groups for cognitive effects have been established for avapritinib 
in the ISM patient population. The lower incidence of cognitive effects in patients receiving 
25 mg avapritinib compared with placebo in the clinical development programme suggests that 
these events are most likely due to the patients’ underlying disease and other treatments patients 
were receiving as part of their BSC. 
Preventability: 
For patients under treatment with avapritinib who experience signs and symptoms of cognitive 
effects, different managing strategies are recommended, based on the severity of the adverse 
reactions. 
Patients experiencing events of Grade 1 in severity should continue at the same or reduced dose 
or interrupt until improvement to baseline or resolution and resume at the same or reduced dose. 
If events of Grade 2 or 3 in severity occur, treatment with avapritinib should be interrupted until 
improvement to baseline, Grade 1 or complete resolution. Therapy can be resumed at the same 
dose  or  at  a  reduced  dose.  Patients  experiencing  cognitive  effects  of  Grade 4  should 
permanently discontinue treatment with avapritinib. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Data from study BLU-285-2203 indicated that avapritinib at the 25 mg dose was not associated 
with  an  increased  risk  for  developing  cognitive  effects  in  patients  with  ISM  compared  with 
placebo. The lower incidence of cognitive effects in the 25 mg avapritinib group suggests that 
these events are most likely due to the patients’ underlying disease and other treatments patients 
were receiving as part of their BSC. 
Given the efficacy observed in this target population and the potential risk of cognitive effects, 
the impact on the benefit-risk balance of avapritinib is acceptable.

SVII.3.1.6  Important Potential Risk 3: Cardiac Toxicity, Including QT Prolongation (All 
Indications) 
Potential Mechanisms: 
Inhibition of tyrosine kinases may cause cardiotoxicity by several different mechanisms [95]. 
However,  not  all  mechanisms  underlying  development  of  cardiotoxicity  have  been  fully 
elucidated and not all TKIs are predicted to exert the same level of toxicity on the heart [93, 
94]. 
Several multitarget inhibitors targeting tyrosine kinase receptors, including PDGFR, have been 
associated  with  cardiac  dysfunction  in  treated  patients,  including  sorafenib,  sunitinib  or 
imatinib [125]. 
PDGFRs are expressed in cardiomyocytes and are unregulated in response to mechanical stress 
in animal model. Inhibition of PDGFRs has been reported to play a protective role in hearts 
exposed  to  ischaemic  injury  in  the  same  animal  model  [126].  PDGFRB  is  required  for 
angiogenesis and preservation of cardiac function in the presence of stress overload [125]. 
The  mechanism  for  a  slight  increase  in  QTc  interval  seen  in  the  clinical  programme  for 
avapritinib is not understood. Based on preclinical study, there is no evidence of a preferential 
Page 71 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan

distribution of avapritinib in the heart to suggest any cardiovascular effect due to high local 
concentrations in the heart. 
QT  prolongation  of  cancer  drugs,  including  small-molecule  TKIs,  has  been  linked  to  an 
off-target  effect  of  some  of  these  therapies,  causing  abnormalities  in  cardiac  repolarisation 
resulting in QT prolongation [96].  
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:  
The non-clinical studies did not show any effects of avapritinib on the cardiovascular system. 
In clinical Study BLU-285-1101, a minor increase in QTc interval was reported at 300/400 mg 
QD dose of avapritinib in 3.9% of patients (13/335). The estimated mean change from baseline 
in QTcF was 6.55 ms (90% CI: 1.80 to 11.29) at the observed steady state geometric mean Cmax 
of 899 ng/mL. These increases were not clinically relevant and no effect on heart rate or cardiac 
conduction (PR, QRS, and RR intervals) was observed. 
The potential for QT prolongation was assessed in the context of the lower 25 mg QD dose of 
avapritinib for the treatment of ISM. As no clinically relevant effect on QTc was observed with 
avapritinib when administered at a dose of 300 or 400 mg QD, no clinically relevant effect is 
anticipated when avapritinib is administered at the 12- to 16-times lower dose of 25 mg QD in 
patients with ISM (12.8-fold lower geometric mean Cmax at the 25 mg QD dose [70.2 ng/mL]). 
Cardiac toxicity seen mostly with multitarget TKIs ranged from asymptomatic QT prolongation 
to reduction  in left ventricular ejection fraction,  symptomatic  congestive  heart  failure,  acute 
coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. Hypertension and sudden death have also been 
associated  with  treatment  with  these  agents  [93-95].  The  relevance  of  these  findings  to 
avapritinib remains unknown. 
The potential for QT prolongation is considered a class effect of small-molecule TKIs despite 
potential  differences  between  individual  agents.  While  dasatinib,  vandetanib,  sorafenib, 
nilotinib, or sunitinib showed QT prolongation frequently (> 5% of patients), based on the large 
systematic  review  of  commonly  used  cancer  drugs  to  determine  the  incidence  of 
QT prolongation and clinically relevant arrhythmias [96], QT prolongation was infrequent or 
absent with afatinib, crizotinib, ceritinib, dovitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, lenvatinib, nintedanib, 
pazopanib, and ponatinib. However, when present, QT prolongation had only rarely clinically 
relevant consequences, defined as arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [96].
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials 
GIST and AdvSM 
Frequency 
In the avapritinib clinical trials (GIST and AdvSM; all doses, N = 803), 39 patients (4.9%) 
experienced  AEs  within  the  Standardised  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA)  Query  (SMQ)  Torsade  de  pointes/QT  prolongation  (refer  to  distribution  of 
events per indication in Table 11). 
In the GIST patient group (all doses; N = 610), 25 patients (4.1%) experienced torsade de 
pointes/QT prolongation events (Table 11). The most common AE was electrocardiogram 
QT prolonged (2.6%). 
In the AdvSM patient group (all doses; N = 193), 14 patients (7.3%) experienced torsade de 
pointes/QT  prolongation  events  (Table 11).  Similar  to  the  GIST  population,  the  most 
common AE was electrocardiogram QT prolonged (3.6%).

The ability of avapritinib to prolong the QT interval was assessed in 27 patients that were 
administered  avapritinib  at  doses  of  300 mg  and  400 mg  QD  in  Study  BLU-285-1101 
(Cardiac Safety Report, Appendix 16.1.13; BLU-285-1101 CSR). The results showed that 
avapritinib had a small effect on the QTc interval at steady-state plasma concentrations. At 
steady state (Day 15), the mean ΔQTcF was 7.0 ms (90% CI: 2.84, 11.14) at the time point 
before dosing, and above 5 ms at all time points after dosing, except at 4 hours after dosing 
(4.6 ms; 90% CI: 0.50, 8.65). The largest mean ΔQTcF was observed at 1 hour and 8 hours 
after  dosing:  9.9  and  9.5 ms,  respectively  (90%  CIs:  5.72,  14.03  and  5.30,  13.62, 
respectively). No patient had a QTcF > 450 ms. In the concentration-QTc analysis of data, a 
linear  model  with  an  intercept  provided  the  best  fit  to  the  observed  QTcF  data  and  was, 
therefore,  used  to  establish  the  relationship between plasma concentrations  of  avapritinib 
and  ΔQTcF.  The  concentration-QTc  analysis  confirmed  that  avapritinib  at  doses  of 
300/400 mg QD resulted in a small increase in QTcF of 6.55 ms (90% CI: 1.80 to 11.29) at 
the observed steady state geometric mean Cmax of 899 ng/mL with a shallow slope of the 
concentration-QTc relationship. A QT effect (ΔQTcF) exceeding 20 ms can be excluded at 
avapritinib  plasma  concentrations  up  to  1,645 ng/mL.  No  effect  on  heart  rate  or  cardiac 
conduction (PR, RR, and QRS intervals) was observed.

Based  on 
in 
Study BLU-285-1303 (data cut-off 09 March 2020), the frequency of patients who reported 
QT prolongation/ventricular arrhythmia events was the same in each of the treatment arms 
(3%). Almost all of these events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and non-serious. There 
was only 1 serious AE reported (ventricular arrhythmia) which occurred in the regorafenib

arm. Based on the data  presented, there is no  evidence that avapritinib is associated with 
events of QT prolongation or ventricular arrhythmias. 
ISM  
In Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203 (avapritinib 25 mg, N = 141; placebo, N = 71), 3 patients 
(2.1%) in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the placebo group experienced 
events within the SMQ Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation. The reported events included 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged (2 patients in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 1 patient in 
the placebo group) and syncope (2 patients in the 25 mg avapritinib group) (Table 12). 
In  the  ISM  patient  group  (all  doses;  N=246),  8 (3.3%)  of  all  avapritinib-treated  patients 
experienced events within the SMQ Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation. The most common 
event was electrocardiogram QT prolonged in 5 patients (2.0%) (Table 12).

Severity 
GIST and AdvSM 
The majority of the reported events were non-serious and only  1% of patients in the overall 
safety  population  (GIST  and  AdvSM;  all  doses;  N = 803)  experienced  serious 
QT prolongation/ventricular  arrhythmia  AEs.  These  included  syncope  and  ventricular 
tachycardia (1 patient each in both GIST and AdvSM patient groups). 
Page 74 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Approximately half of the AEs were Grade 1 in severity, resolved, and were assessed as not 
related to avapritinib. All but 4 events were non-serious (see above) and none of the serious 
events were assessed as related to avapritinib. 
ISM 
None  of  the  reported  events  within  the  SMQ  Torsade  de  pointes/QT  prolongation  in  the 
overall safety population (ISM; all doses; N = 246) were serious. 
In Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203 (avapritinib 25 mg, N = 141; placebo, N = 71), 1 patient 
each in the 25 mg avapritinib group had QTcF > 480 msec and > 500 msec compared to no 
patients in the placebo group. 
An increased QTcF > 60 msec from baseline was reported in 3 (2.1%) patients (all female) 
in the 25 mg avapritinib group and no patients in the placebo group. QTcF was > 500 msec 
in only 1 patient and was not associated with any relevant AEs. In the remaining 2 patients, 
QTcF did not increase beyond 470 msec, which is considered to be within the upper normal 
range in female patients and therefore not clinically meaningful. 
In Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203 (avapritinib 25 mg, N = 141; placebo, N = 71), 1 patient 
in the avapritinib 25 mg group with a medical history of intermittent dizziness experienced 
a Grade 3 syncope assessed as not related to avapritinib. The event was not associated with 
QT prolongation at the time of the occurrence. The patient continued treatment with no new 
episodes reported. Syncope, Grade 1 in severity, was not associated with QT prolongation 
in the other patient in the avapritinib 25 mg group either. It is important to note that patients 
with ISM frequently suffer from MC mediator-related symptoms that include syncope. 
Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes 
Not yet established for avapritinib in any patient population (i.e., GIST, AdvSM, and ISM). 
QT  prolongation  has  been  linked  to  an  increased  risk  of  life-threatening  ventricular 
arrhythmia or events of sudden cardiac death [96]. Moreover, a modest QTc prolongation 
was shown to be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, stroke and all-cause 
mortality in variety of patient population [127, 128]. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
The impact of clinically relevant QT prolongation effects may be significant. In general, the 
impact  of  QT  prolongation  on  patients  depends  on  patients’  risk  factors  and  clinical 
consequences of such prolongation, which may be life-threatening or fatal. 
Post-Authorisation Experience (Data Lock Point of 08 July 2022) 
A comprehensive analysis of data collected during the post-marketing experience in patients 
with GIST and AdvSM does not indicate a change in the characterisation of the risk. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Patients with a prior history of cardiac disease are in general at higher risk of cardiac damage 
associated with TKIs [95]. 
Patients  with  underlying  ECG  or  cardiac  abnormalities,  including  patients  with  a  prolonged 
QTc, defined as QTcF of > 480 ms, with a history of prolonged QT syndrome or torsade de 
pointes or patients with a family history of prolonged QT syndrome may be at higher risk of 
effects on QT interval and were, therefore, excluded from the clinical trials with avapritinib but 
are expected in clinical practice within the target population of avapritinib. 
Page 75 
 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Concomitant treatment with drugs with a known potential to prolong QT interval such as azole 
antifungals, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and others may increase the risk. 
Additionally, elderly patients or patients with electrolyte imbalance are at higher risk of QTc 
prolongation [129]. 
Preventability: 
Patients  with  GIST  and  AdvSM  at-risk  of  QT  prolongation  (e.g.,  patients  with  electrolyte 
imbalance)  should  avoid  concomitant  treatment  with  medication  with  a  known  potential  to 
prolong QT interval (e.g., azole antifungals, fluoroquinolones, macrolides).Patients with GIST 
and AdvSM with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities should be closely monitored for any signs 
of QT prolongation during therapy with avapritinib. 
Treatment with 25 mg avapritinib was not associated with an increased risk of QT prolongation 
and no clinically relevant effect is anticipated when avapritinib is administered in patients with 
ISM. 
In patients with ISM, QT interval assessments by ECG should be considered, in particular in 
patients  with  concurrent  factors  that  could  prolong  QT  (e.g.,  age,  pre-existing  heart  rhythm 
disorders, etc.). 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Prolonged QT interval can lead to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac 
death  in  patients  with  predisposing  factors,  including  concomitant  use  of  medication  with 
known potential for QT prolongation. In light of currently available non-clinical and clinical 
data related to potential for QT prolongation and anticipated benefits of avapritinib in the target 
population, the impact on avapritinib is acceptable. 
Public Health Impact: 
Not applicable. 
SVII.3.1.7  Important Potential Risk 4: Embryofoetal Toxicity (All Indications) 
Potential Mechanisms: 
The embryofoetal toxicity of avapritinib is a consequence of its mechanism of action causing 
inhibition of wild-type KIT and PDGFRA activity.  
Loss  of  function  studies  in  mice  demonstrated  that  KIT  activity  is  required  for  proper 
development  of  the  red  blood  cell  lineage,  as  well  as  reproductive  and  melanocyte  function 
[130-132], thus inhibition of KIT could cause disturbances of the embryogenesis process. 
Similarly, inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptor PDGFRA was shown to result in birth defects, 
including facial clefting, severe spina bifida occulta, cardiac defects, omphalocele, renal and 
urogenital anomalies, and vertebral and rib fusion abnormalities [133]. 
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:  
Data  from  the  rodent  embryofoetal  development  studies  showed  that  avapritinib  has 
embryotoxic effects (refer to PART II: Module SII). These results are further supported by the 
post-marketing  data for  other  TKI agents  such as  imatinib in pregnant women showing  that 
maternal  exposure  during  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  can  lead  to  foetal  development 
complications  and spontaneous  abortion [92, 103]. No data on  the use of avapritinib during 
pregnancy are available.

Blueprint Medicines 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Clinical Trials 
GIST, AdvSM, and ISM 
Frequency 
Not yet established in any patient population (i.e., GIST, AdvSM, and ISM). 
Pregnant women were excluded from the clinical development programme and no events of 
pregnancy occurred during the avapritinib clinical trials. 
Post-marketing  reports  of  use  of  other  approved  TKI  agents,  such  as  imatinib,  during 
pregnancy, showed that the apparent rate of malformations following exposure to imatinib 
in  the  first  trimester  is  11%  [92,  103].  No  malformations  were  observed  in  the  liveborn 
infants when in utero exposure to imatinib took place during the second and/or third trimester 
of pregnancy [92, 103]. 
Severity 
In  non-clinical  studies  (refer  to  PART  II:  Module  SII),  avapritinib  was  teratogenic  and 
embryotoxic in rats at doses 2.4 times greater than the human exposure at a dose of 400 mg. 
Exposure  to  other  TKI  agents  during  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  led  to  spontaneous 
foetal  death  and  malformations,  including  exomphalos,  skeletal  malformation  including 
hemivertebrae and scoliosis, meningocele, kidney agenesis, hypospadias, and to premature 
death of the newborns [92, 103].  
Reversibility 
None 
Long-Term Outcomes 
Not yet established in any patient population (i.e., GIST, AdvSM, and ISM). 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Embryofoetal  toxicity  is  a  significant  complication  of  pregnancy  with  marked  impact  on 
both the mother and the foetus/child [92, 103]. 
In TKI-exposed pregnancies which completed to term, severe malformations were seen in 
the newborns, requiring medical care, surgical intervention and in some cases, culminating 
in premature death [92, 103]. 
Post-Authorisation Experience (Data Lock Point of 08 July 2022) 
No case reports of embryofoetal toxicity were received from the post-marketing experience 
with avapritinib. 
Post-marketing  reports  of  use  of  other  approved  TKI  agents,  such  as  imatinib,  during 
pregnancy, showed that the apparent rate of malformations following exposure to imatinib 
in  the  first  trimester  is  11%  [92,  103].  No  malformations  were  observed  in  the  liveborn 
infants when in utero exposure to imatinib took place during the second and/or third trimester 
of pregnancy [92, 103]. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
No specific risk factors or risk groups, other than exposure in pregnant women during the first 
trimester of pregnancy, have yet been identified. 
Page 77 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Preventability: 
All women of child-bearing potential treated with avapritinib, or men treated with avapritinib 
who have female partners of child-bearing potential, must use effective contraception methods 
during treatment and for at least 6 weeks for females and 2 weeks for males after the last dose 
of avapritinib.  
Adherence to these recommendations should limit the cases of avapritinib exposure in pregnant 
women and thus prevent any potential malformations that foetal exposure might cause. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
If  pregnancy  were  to  occur  while  receiving  treatment  with  avapritinib,  therapy  should  be 
withheld unless the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risk to the foetus. 
Even though the nature and severity of embryofoetal toxicity events cannot be anticipated based 
on the currently available data, occurrence of such events would have a significant impact on 
individual  patients.  Routine  risk  minimisation  measures  should  suffice  for  informing  the 
patients in this respect. 
Public Health Impact:

SVII.3.2  Presentation of the Missing Information 
SVII.3.2.1  Missing Information 1: Use in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment (All 
Indications) 
Evidence Source: 
Following a single oral dose of ~310 mg (~100 μCi) [14C]-avapritinib, faecal excretion was the 
predominant route of elimination of drug-related material (70.3%) and excretion in urine was 
the  secondary  route  of  elimination  (17.9%).  Unchanged  avapritinib  represented  11.0%  and 
0.23% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, respectively. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis, avapritinib exposures were similar among 
53 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within the ULN and AST above the 
ULN or total bilirubin above 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), 6 subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin of above 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST), and 284 subjects with 
normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within the ULN). 
In the completed category 3 PASS BLU-285-0107, investigating the effect of severe hepatic 
impairment (score of 10 to 15 on the Child-Pugh scale) on the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib 
following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg avapritinib in 8 subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment and 8 matched control subjects with normal hepatic function, the unbound 
concentrations of avapritinib were higher in patients with severe hepatic impairment compared 
to healthy matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Anticipated Risk/Consequence of the Missing Information: 
Analyses of data from a small set number of patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
demonstrated that exposure levels in this subpopulation were similar to those in patients with 
normal hepatic function. As such, no avapritinib dose adjustments are recommended in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
However, given that hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for avapritinib and based 
on the results of the completed category 3 PASS BLU-285-0107, severe hepatic impairment 
may  result  in  alteration  of  plasma  avapritinib  concentrations.  Following  results  of  the 
Page 78

BLU-285-0107  study,  dose  modification  recommendations  are  proposed  in  the  product 
information  (i.e., modified  starting  dose  of  avapritinib  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment) to result in comparable avapritinib unbound concentrations in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. The safety profile and potential 
long-term effects of avapritinib use in patients with severe hepatic impairment require further 
characterisation. 
SVII.3.2.2  Missing  Information 2:  Drug-Drug  Interaction  with  CYP3A  Substrates  (All 
Indications) 
Evidence Source: 
In  vitro  studies  demonstrated  that  avapritinib  is  a  direct  inhibitor  of  CYP3A  and  a 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. Therefore, avapritinib may have the potential to increase 
plasma  concentrations  of  co-administered  medicinal  products  that  are  substrates  of  CYP3A 
(refer to PART II: Module SII). 
The pharmacokinetics of avapritinib in patients using avapritinib concomitantly with CYP3A 
substrates has not yet been established. 
Anticipated Risk/Consequence of the Missing Information: 
The  concomitant  use  of  avapritinib  with  CYP3A  substrates  (especially  those  with  narrow 
therapeutic  index)  may  result  in  alteration  of  their  plasma  concentrations  that  cannot  be 
predicted based on available data.

Primary Objective: 
  To describe types, severity, and rates of AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation 
or decreased dosing of avapritinib, AEs of special interest, and deaths. 
Secondary Objective: 
  To evaluate efficacy in terms of disease response to treatment, PFS, and overall survival, as

Study Design: 
This is a multinational, open-label, observational PASS that will evaluate the long-term safety 
and efficacy of avapritinib in first-line or following  4 months of imatinib treatment at least 
50 patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutated GIST. 
Study Population: 
Patients will be included from multiple sites worldwide. Three patient populations are planned 
to be enrolled:  
  Patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutated GIST who are scheduled to receive avapritinib 
in the first line (or have received imatinib for  4 months). 
  Patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutated GIST who are already receiving treatment with 
avapritinib (in the first-line or following ≤ 4 months of imatinib treatment). 
  Patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutated GIST who previously received treatment with 
avapritinib in the first line or following ≤ 4 months of imatinib treatment and have 
discontinued treatment. 
In addition to  evaluating  safety  and efficacy of first-line avapritinib treatment, patients  who 
were initially treated with imatinib for ≤ 4 months are also being included in this study to allow 
for  practical,  real-world,  clinical  experience  with  use  of  avapritinib  in  the  PDGFRA 
D842V-mutated GIST population setting and increase the feasibility of study completion in this 
ultra-rare patient population.

PART VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary  of  Risk  Management  Plan  for  AYVAKYT 
(avapritinib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for AYVAKYT. The RMP details important risks 
of AYVAKYT, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
AYVAKYT’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
AYVAKYT’s summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how AYVAKYT should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for AYVAKYT should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current ones  will be  included  in  updates of  AYVAKYT’s 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used for 
AYVAKYT  is  authorised  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or 
metastatic  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours  (GIST)  harbouring  the  PDGFRA  D842V  mutation,  as 
monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  aggressive  systemic  mastocytosis  (ASM), 
systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) or mast cell leukaemia 
(MCL)  after  at  least  one  systemic  therapy,  and  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  indolent 
systemic mastocytosis (ISM) (see SmPC for the full indications). It contains avapritinib as the active 
substance administered via oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of AYVAKYT’s benefits can be found in AYVAKYT’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to 
Minimise or Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of AYVAKYT, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about AYVAKYT’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  AYVAKYT  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  AYVAKYT  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of AYVAKYT. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term 
use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of Important Risks 
Identified Risk: Intracranial Haemorrhage (GIST and AdvSM) 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
This  risk  is  based  on  the  events  of  intracranial 
haemorrhage  (subdural  haematoma,  haemorrhage 
intracranial,  and  cerebral  haemorrhage)  observed  in 
the  clinical 
subjects  exposed 
development  programme,  even  though  the  causality 
evaluation of the events was confounded by alternative 
aetiologies or other risk factors. 
to  avapritinib 
in 
The non-clinical data from the avapritinib development 
programme showed the development of choroid plexus 
oedema in dogs with exposure margins of 4.7, 1.0, and 
0.4 times the human exposure at the 25 mg, 200 mg, 
and 300 mg clinical doses, respectively, as well as brain 
haemorrhage  in  dogs  with  exposure  margins  of  9.0, 
1.8, and 0.8 times the human exposure at the 25 mg,

Identified Risk: Intracranial Haemorrhage (GIST and AdvSM) 
Risk factors and risk groups 
200 mg,  and  300 mg  clinical  doses  of  avapritinib, 
respectively. 
In  addition,  intracranial  haemorrhage  was  associated 
with use of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such 
as  dasatinib  or  imatinib  (Mustafa  Ali  et  al.  2015), 
including  their  use  in  patients  with  GIST  (Feki  et  al. 
2015, Theodotou et al. 2016). 
Lastly,  a  majority  of  AdvSM  patients  with  intracranial 
haemorrhage had severe thrombocytopenia, preceding 
or at the time of the event. 
Intracranial haemorrhage occurs in 7% of patients with 
cancer, and subdural haematoma has been estimated 
to account for 26% of intracranial haemorrhage found 
at autopsy in this population of patients (Reichman et 
al. 2012). 
Intracranial haemorrhage accounts for nearly one half 
of all cerebrovascular events in cancer patients, but the 
risk  factors  vary  between types  of  cancer (Navi  et  al. 
2010).  Intracranial  haemorrhage 
in 
haematological malignancies or in the presence of brain 
metastases. However, brain metastases are extremely 
rare  in  GIST  (Naoe  et  al.  2011)  and  only  16  cases of 
brain metastases in patients with GIST were reported 
in the literature until 2014 (Sato et al. 2014). 
is  common 
Events  of  subdural  haematoma  in  patients  with  GIST 
treated  with  imatinib  were  reported  in  the  literature 
(Feki et al. 2015, Theodotou et al. 2016) in the absence 
of  other  obvious  causes  such  as  head  trauma,  brain 
thrombocytopenia  or  anticoagulation 
metastases, 
which represent the most common general risk factors 
for such events, and the suspected cause was imatinib-
related platelet dysfunction. It has been estimated that 
the rate of imatinib-related intracranial haemorrhage in 
the absence of other obvious causes may be between 
1.9 and 5.7% (Theodotou et al. 2016). 
Thrombocytopenia  is  a  known  risk  factor  for  internal 
haemorrhage,  including  intracranial  haemorrhage.  In 
patients  with  GIST,  thrombocytopenia  adverse  events 
(AEs) were observed at a low frequency (18 patients; 
3.0%).  Grade 1  thrombocytopenia  was  reported  in 
16 patients,  and  Grade 2  and  Grade 3  in  1 patient 
each.  However,  thrombocytopenia  adverse  events 
(AEs) were reported in more than a third of the patients 
with AdvSM (77 patients; 39.9%) and in more than half 
of  these  patients  the  thrombocytopenia  AEs  were 
≥Grade 3 in severity (43 of 77 patients; 56%).

the  12 patients  with  AdvSM  with 
intracranial 
haemorrhage  had  severe  thrombocytopenia  with 
platelet  counts  below  50 × 109/L,  and  2 patients  had 
mild  thrombocytopenia  (platelet  counts  between  less 
than lower limit of normal and 75 × 109/L) at the time 
of the event. 
As  severe  thrombocytopenia  is  a  known  complication 
associated with AdvSM, due to bone marrow infiltration 
by  MCs,  this  likely  explains  the  higher  frequency  of 
intracranial haemorrhage seen in patients with AdvSM 
compared  with  patients  with  GIST  treated  with 
avapritinib.  
In  addition  to  severe  thrombocytopenia  prior  to  or at 
the time of  the  intracranial  haemorrhage,  a review of 
case reports of patients with intracranial haemorrhage 
events identified several other potential risk factors for 
such events including use of concomitant anti-platelet 
or  anti-thrombotic  therapy  any  time  from  the  date  of 
first dose of study drug to the date of last dose of study

Risk  mitigation  strategies  were  implemented  for  all 
AdvSM  patients  to  minimise  the  risk  for  intracranial 
haemorrhage.  These  measures  included  exclusion  of 
patients with a platelet count < 50 × 109/L at baseline, 
monitoring of platelet count at every treatment cycle, 
detailed  guidance  on  dose  modification,  and  defining 
the  starting  dose  of  avapritinib  to  be  200 mg  QD. 
Additionally,  to  mitigate  against  a  second  bleed, 
protocols  were  amended  such  that  patients  who 
experienced  an  intracranial  haemorrhage  of  any 
toxicity  grade  permanently  discontinued  avapritinib 
treatment. With such risk minimisation measures, the 
current intracranial haemorrhage incidence is 2.5% in 
patients  with  AdvSM  who  did  not  have  pre-existing 
severe thrombocytopenia and were treated at a starting 
dose of 200 mg QD.

Identified Risk: Cognitive Effects (GIST and AdvSM) 
Risk factors and risk groups 
increased frequency in subjects exposed to avapritinib 
in  the  clinical  development  programme.  In  addition, 
cognitive  effects  have  been  identified  in  association 
with  other  authorised  TKIs  such  as  larotrectinib 
(Vitrakvi  SmPC,  2019)  and  lorlatinib  (Lorviqua  SmPC, 
2019). 
Several  risk  factors  and  risk  groups  prone  to  develop 
cognitive  effects  have  been  identified  based  on 
quantitative and qualitative analysis of available data. 
These  include  increased  age,  medical  history  of 
cognitive effects, together with polypharmacy and use 
of  central  nervous  system  medications,  increased 
avapritinib dosage and other concurrent pathologies or 
disease progression. 
Analyses  of  patients  in  the  overall  safety  population 
(N=803) showed that the incidence of cognitive effects 
was  slightly  higher 
in  patients  aged  ≥65 years 
compared  with  patients  aged  < 65 years  (42.4%  vs 
38.1%).  This  difference  is  not  unexpected  because 
cognitive  issues  are  known  to  increase  with  age 
(Harada et al. 2013). Furthermore, this is in accordance 
with  other  studies  that  found  similar  correlation 
between  the  age  of  the  patient  and  development  of 
cognitive effects while undergoing anti-cancer therapy 
(Ahles et al. 2010).  
There  appeared  to  be  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of 
cognitive effects in female compared to male patients 
(44.9 vs. 37.2%) and in white compared to non-white 
patients (41.4% vs. 36.8%). 
The incidence of events of cognitive effects was higher 
in patients from North America compared with patients 
from Europe or Australia and Asia (51.5% vs 31.2% and 
31.9%,  respectively).  This  difference  appears  to  be 
driven  by  a  higher  incidence  of  events  of  memory 
impairment in North American patients compared with 
patients from the above regions (31.1% vs 10.7% and 
14.2%). The cause of this observation is not clear.  
The incidence of cognitive effects was also found to be 
higher in patients with prior regorafenib use compared 
with  patients  with  no  regorafenib  use  in  the  GIST 
population. 
Other variables that did not appear to show a significant 
impact  on  the  incidence  of  cognitive  effects  included 
prior number of TKI therapies and total duration of prior 
TKI therapy. 
A  multivariable  logistic  regression  analysis  performed 
for cognitive effects of any grade showed that the odds 
of experiencing a cognitive effect were increased by a 
multiplier of  167%  if  a  patient  had  medical  history  of 
cognitive effects. This is in accordance with publications 
Page 99 
 
Avapritinib Risk Management Plan 
Blueprint Medicines 
Identified Risk: Cognitive Effects (GIST and AdvSM) 
indicating  that  the  level  of  cognitive  reserve  prior  to 
treatment  plays  a  role  in  development  of  cognitive 
effects during anti-cancer therapy (Ahles et al. 2010). 
This  refers  to  the  innate  and  developed  cognitive 
capacity,  which  is  influenced  by  various  factors, 
including genetics, education, occupational attainment, 
and lifestyle. Results of one longitudinal study showed 
that  patients  who  had  lower  pre-treatment  cognitive 
reserve  performed  worse  on  measures  of  Processing 
Speed  compared  with  patients  not  exposed  to 
chemotherapy and healthy controls (Ahles et al. 2010). 
As  such,  patients  with  higher  baseline  cognitive 
performance may have more cushion against cognitive 
detriments  than  individuals  with  a  lower  baseline 
cognitive performance.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Cognitive  effects  were  reported  at  a  low  frequency  in 
patients  receiving  avapritinib  in  patients  with  ISM  in 
Part 2 of study BLU-285-2203, and the frequency was 
slightly lower in the 25 mg avapritinib group compared 
with  the  placebo  group.  In  this  study,  treatment  with 
25 mg  avapritinib  in  patients  with  ISM  was  not 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  developing 
cognitive effect events. 
However,  cognitive  effects  represent  a known  risk  for 
avapritinib in patients with GIST and AdvSM and have 
been observed in these patient populations treated with 
avapritinib  at  higher  doses,  despite  that  the  causality 
of the events was confounded by alternative aetiologies 
or other risk factors.

No  specific  risk  factors  or  risk  groups  for  cognitive 
effects have been established for avapritinib in the ISM 
patient  population.  The  lower  incidence  of  cognitive 
effects 
receiving  25 mg  avapritinib 
compared  with  placebo  in  the  clinical  development 
programme suggests that these events are most likely 
due  to  the  patients’  underlying  disease  and  other 
treatments patients were receiving as part of their best 
supportive care.

Potential Risk: Cardiac Toxicity, Including QT Prolongation (All Indications) 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
The  non-clinical  studies  did  not  show  any  effects  of 
avapritinib  on  the  cardiovascular  system.  In  clinical 
Study BLU-285-1101, a minor increase in QTc interval 
was reported at 300/400 mg QD dose of avapritinib in 
3.9%  of  patients  (13/335).  The  estimated  mean 
change  from  baseline  in  QTcF  was  6.55 ms  (90%  CI: 
1.80 to 11.29) at the observed steady state geometric 
mean  maximum  plasma  concentration  of  899 ng/mL. 
These  increases  were  not  clinically  relevant  and  no 
effect on heart rate or cardiac conduction (PR, QRS, and 
RR intervals) was observed. 
The  potential  for  QT  prolongation  was  applied  to  the 
lower 25 mg QD dose of avapritinib for the treatment 
of  ISM.  As  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  QTc  was 
observed with avapritinib when administered at a dose 
of  300  or  400 mg  QD,  no  clinically  relevant  effect  is 
anticipated  when  avapritinib  is  administered  at  the 
12- to  16-times  lower  dose  of  25 mg  QD  in  patients

avapritinib remains unknown.

Potential Risk: Cardiac Toxicity, Including QT Prolongation (All Indications) 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The potential for QT prolongation is considered a class 
effect  of  small  molecule  TKIs  despite  potential 
differences between individual agents. While dasatinib, 
vandetanib, sorafenib, nilotinib, or sunitinib showed QT 
prolongation  frequently  (> 5%  of  patients),  based  on 
the large systematic review of commonly used cancer 
drugs  to  determine  the  incidence  of  QT  prolongation 
and  clinically  relevant  arrhythmias  (Porta-Sanchez, 
2017), QT prolongation was infrequent or absent with 
afatinib,  crizotinib,  ceritinib,  dovitinib, 
imatinib, 
lenvatinib,  nintedanib,  pazopanib,  and 
lapatinib, 
ponatinib.  However,  when  present,  QT  prolongation 
had  only  rarely  clinically  relevant  consequences, 
defined  as  arrhythmias  and  sudden  cardiac  death 
(Porta-Sanchez, 2017). 
Patients  with  a  prior  history  of  cardiac  disease  are  in 
general  at  higher  risk  of  cardiac  damage  associated 
with TKIs (Lee and Kim 2018). 
Patients  with  underlying  electrocardiogram  or  cardiac 
abnormalities, including patients with a prolonged QTc, 
defined  as  QTcF  of  > 480 ms,  with  a  history  of 
prolonged  QT  syndrome  or  torsade  de  pointes  or 
patients  with  a  family  history  of  prolonged  QT 
syndrome  may  be  at  higher  risk  of  effects  on  QT 
interval and were, therefore, excluded from the clinical 
trials  with  avapritinib  but  are  expected  in  clinical 
practice within the target population of avapritinib. 
Concomitant  treatment  with  drugs  with  a  known 
potential  to  prolong  QT  interval  such  as  azole 
antifungals,  fluoroquinolones,  macrolides  and  others 
may increase the risk. 
Additionally,  elderly  patients  or  patients  with 
electrolyte  imbalance  are  at  higher  risk  of  QTc 
prolongation (Kloth et al. 2015).

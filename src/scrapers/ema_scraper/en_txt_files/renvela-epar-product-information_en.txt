4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. 
Renvela is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) not on dialysis with serum phosphorus ≥ 1.78 mmol/l. 
Renvela should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium 
supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone 
disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Starting dose 
The recommended starting dose of sevelamer carbonate is 2.4 g or 4.8 g per day based on clinical needs and 
serum phosphorus level.  Renvela must be taken three times per day with meals. 
Serum phosphorus level in patients 
1.78 – 2.42 mmol/l (5.5 – 7.5 mg/dl) 
> 2.42 mmol/l (> 7.5 mg/dl) 
Total daily dose of sevelamer carbonate to be 
taken over 3 meals per day 
2.4 g* 
4.8 g* 
*Plus subsequent titrating, see section “Titration and maintenance”  
For patients previously on phosphate binders (sevelamer hydrochloride or calcium based), Renvela should be 
given on a gram for gram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. 
Titration and maintenance 
Serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate titrated by 0.8 g three 
times per day (2.4 g/day) increments every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached, 
with regular monitoring thereafter. 
Patients taking sevelamer carbonate should adhere to their prescribed diets. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In clinical practice, treatment will be continuous based on the need to control serum phosphorus levels and 
the daily dose is expected to be an average of approximately 6 g per day. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly population. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Renvela in children below the age of 6 years                           or in children with a BSA below 
0.75 m2 have not been established. Not data are available. 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Renvela  in  children  over  6  year  of  age  and  a  BSA  >0.75  m2  have  been 
established. Current available data are described in section 5.1. 
For paediatric patients the oral suspension should be administered, as tablet formulations are not 
appropriate for this population. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Tablets should be swallowed intact and should not be crushed, chewed, or broken into pieces prior to 
administration. Renvela should be taken with food and not on an empty stomach. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Hypophosphataemia  
Bowel obstruction.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in adult patients with chronic 
kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus < 1.78 mmol/l.  Therefore it is currently not 
recommended for use in these patients. 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in patients with the following 
disorders: 
• 
• 
• 
dysphagia 
swallowing disorders 
severe gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, retention of 
gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion 
• 
active inflammatory bowel disease 
•  major gastrointestinal tract surgery 
Treatment of these patients with Renvela should only be initiated after careful benefit/risk assessment. If the 
therapy is initiated, patients suffering from these disorders should be monitored.  Renvela treatment should 
be reevaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus 
In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment 
with sevelamer hydrochloride (capsules/tablets), which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer 
carbonate. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored 
carefully while being treated with Renvela. The treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop 
severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms.

Fat-soluble vitamins and folate deficiency 
Patients with CKD may develop low levels of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, depending on dietary 
intake and the severity of their disease. It cannot be excluded that sevelamer carbonate can bind fat-soluble 
vitamins contained in ingested food. In patients not taking supplemental vitamins but on sevelamer, serum 
vitamin A, D, E and K status should be assessed regularly. It is recommended that vitamin supplements be 
given if necessary. It is recommended that CKD patients not on dialysis are given vitamin D supplements 
(approximately 400 IU of native vitamin D daily) which can be part of a multivitamin preparation to be taken 
apart from their dose of sevelamer carbonate. In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis additional 
monitoring of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid is recommended, since vitamin A, D, E and K levels were 
not measured in a clinical study in these patients. 
There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term sevelamer 
carbonate treatment. In patients not taking supplemental folic acid but on sevelamer, folate level should be 
assessed regularly. 
Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia 
Patients with CKD may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Sevelamer carbonate does not contain 
any calcium. Serum calcium levels should therefore be monitored at regular intervals and elemental calcium 
should be given as a supplement if required.  
Metabolic acidosis 
Patients with CKD are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis. As part of good clinical practice, 
monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore recommended. 
Peritonitis 
Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to dialysis modality. Peritonitis is 
a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and in a clinical trial with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, a greater number of peritonitis cases were reported in the sevelamer group than in the control 
group. Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the correct use of appropriate 
aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with 
peritonitis. 
Swallowing and choking difficulties 
Uncommon reports of difficulty swallowing the Renvela tablet have been reported.  Many of these cases 
involved patients with co-morbid conditions including swallowing disorders or oesophageal abnormalities. 
Proper swallowing ability should be carefully monitored in patients with co-morbid conditions.  The use of 
sevelamer carbonate powder in patients with a history of difficulty swallowing should be considered. 
Hypothyroidism 
Closer monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer carbonate and 
levothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hyperparathyroidism 
Sevelamer carbonate is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. 
Inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders  
Cases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including serious 
complications such as haemorrhage, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis and colonic/caecal mass) 
associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported (see section 4.8). Inflammatory 
disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Sevelamer carbonate treatment should be re-
evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms.

Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dialysis 
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. 
Ciprofloxacin 
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-
administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, sevelamer carbonate 
should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. 
Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients 
Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant 
patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (e.g., graft 
rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood 
concentrations of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of 
combination and after its withdrawal.  
Levothyroxine 
Very rare cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients co-administered with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, and levothyroxine. Closer 
monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving 
sevelamer carbonate and levothyroxine. 
Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products 
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal 
products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, possible reduction 
in absorption cannot be excluded. The anti-arrhythmic medical product should be taken at least one hour 
before or three hours after Renvela, and blood monitoring can be considered. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in 
patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer carbonate. Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing PPI to patients concomitantly treated with Renvela. The phosphate serum level 
should be monitored and the Renvela dosage adjusted consequently. 
Bioavailability 
Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically 
significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before 
or three hours after sevelamer carbonate, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 
Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sevelamer in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown some reproductive toxicity when sevelamer was administered to rats at high doses (see section 5.3). 
Sevelamer has also been shown to reduce the absorption of several vitamins including folic acid (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. Sevelamer carbonate should only be given to 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the 
mother and the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sevelamer/metabolites are excreted in human milk. The non-absorbed nature of 
sevelamer indicates that excretion of sevelamer in breast milk is unlikely.  A decision on whether to 
continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with sevelamer carbonate should be 
made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of sevelamer carbonate 
therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown that 
sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose 2 times the 
maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently occurring (≥ 5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal disorders 
system organ class. Most of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of sevelamer (as either carbonate and hydrochloride salts) has been investigated in numerous 
clinical trials involving a total of 969 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of 4 to 50 weeks 
(724 patients treated with sevelamer hydrochloride and 245 with sevelamer carbonate), 97 peritoneal dialysis 
patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks (all treated with sevelamer hydrochloride) and 128 patients with 
CKD not on dialysis with treatment duration of 8 to 12 weeks (79 patients treatment with sevelamer 
hydrochloride and 49 with sevelamer carbonate). 
Adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials or that were spontaneously reported from post-
marketing experience are listed by frequency in the table below.  The reporting rate is classified as very 
common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Paediatric population 
In general, the safety profile for children and adolescents (6 to 18 years of age) is similar to the safety profile 
for adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been given to 
normal healthy volunteers in doses of up to 14 grams per day for eight days with no adverse reactions. In 
CKD patients, the maximum average daily dose studied was 14.4 grams of sevelamer carbonate in a single 
daily dose. 
The symptoms observed in case of overdose are similar to adverse reactions listed in section 4.8, including 
mainly constipation and other known gastrointestinal disorders. 
Appropriate symptomatic treatment should be provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and 
hyperphosphataemia. ATC code: V03A E02. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Renvela contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and 
calcium. Sevelamer contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone which 
become protonated in the stomach. These protonated amines bind negatively charged ions such as dietary 
phosphate in the intestine.  
Pharmacodynamic effect 
By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer lowers the 
phosphorus concentration in the serum. Regular monitoring of serum phosphorus levels is always necessary 
during phosphate binder administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In two randomised, cross over clinical trials, sevelamer carbonate in both tablet and powder formulations 
when administered three times per day has been shown to be therapeutically equivalent to sevelamer 
hydrochloride and therefore effective in controlling serum phosphorus in CKD patients on haemodialysis. 
The first study demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times per day was equivalent to 
sevelamer hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 79 haemodialysis patients treated over two 
randomised 8 week treatment periods (mean serum phosphorus time-weighted averages were 
1.5 ± 0.3 mmol/l for both sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride). The second study 
demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate powder dosed three times per day was equivalent to sevelamer 
hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 31 hyperphosphataemic (defined as serum phosphorus 
levels ≥ 1.78 mmol/l) haemodialysis patients over two randomised 4 week treatment periods (mean serum 
phosphorus time-weighted averages were 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/l for sevelamer carbonate powder and 1.7 ± 
0.4 mmol/l for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets).  
In the clinical trials in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and clinically 
significant effect on iPTH. In a 12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH 
reductions were seen compared with patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the iPTH levels. 
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile acid 
binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In clinical trials 
of sevelamer, both the mean total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol declined by 15-39%. The decrease in 
cholesterol has been observed after 2 weeks of treatment and is maintained with long-term treatment. 
Triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and albumin levels did not change following sevelamer treatment. 
Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, 
E and K. 
Sevelamer does not contain calcium and decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to 
patients using calcium based phosphate binders alone. The effects of sevelamer on phosphorus and calcium 
were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year follow-up. This information was obtained 
from studies in which sevelamer hydrochloride was used. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of sevelamer carbonate in hyperphosphatemic paediatric patients with CKD was 
evaluated in a multicenter study with a 2-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed dose period (FDP) 
followed by a 6-month, single-arm, open-label, dose titration period (DTP). A total of 101 patients (6 to 18 
years old with a BSA range of 0.8 m2 to 2.4 m2) were randomised in the study. Forty-nine (49) patients 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received sevelamer carbonate and 51 received placebo during the 2 week FDP. Thereafter all patients 
received sevelamer carbonate for the 26-week DTP. The study met its primary endpoint, meaning Sevelamer 
carbonate reduced serum phosphorus by an LS mean difference of 0.90 mg/dL compared to placebo, and 
secondary efficacy endpoints. In paediatric patients with hyperphosphatemia secondary to CKD, sevelamer 
carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus levels compared to placebo during a 2-week FDP. The 
treatment response was maintained in the paediatric patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-
month open-label DTP. 27% of paediatric patients reached their age appropriate serum phosphorus level at 
end of treatment. These figures were 23% and 15% in the subgroup of patients on hemodialysis and 
peritoneal dialysis, respectively. The treatment response during the 2-week FDP was not affected by BSA, in 
contrast however, no treatment response was observed in paediatric patients with qualifying phosphorus 
levels <7.0 mg/dL. Most of adverse events reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate 
were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer 
carbonate during the study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out with sevelamer carbonate. Sevelamer hydrochloride, 
which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract, as confirmed by an absorption study in healthy volunteers. 
In a clinical trial of one year, no evidence of accumulation of sevelamer was seen. However the potential 
absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment (> one year) cannot be totally 
excluded. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data with sevelamer reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity.  
Carcinogenicity studies with oral sevelamer hydrochloride were conducted in mice (doses of up to 
9 g/kg/day) and rats (0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day). There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional 
cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial 
dose of 14.4 g). There was no increased incidence of tumours observed in mice (human equivalent dose 
3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). 
In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a 
statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer 
hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. 
In rats and dogs, sevelamer reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K (coagulation factors), and 
folic acid. 
Deficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in foetuses of female rats dosed with 
sevelamer at intermediate and high doses (human equivalent dose less than the maximum clinical trial dose 
of 14.4 g). The effects may be secondary to vitamin D depletion. 
In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase 
of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical 
trial dose). 
Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study 
in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated 
for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 2 times 
the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. 
Renvela is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) not on dialysis with serum phosphorus ≥ 1.78 mmol/l. 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients (>6 years of age and a body 
surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease. 
Renvela should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium 
supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone 
disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration

For patients previously on phosphate binders (sevelamer hydrochloride or calcium based), Renvela should be 
given on a gram for gram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. 
Titration and maintenance 
*Adults 
For adult patients, serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate titrated 
by 0.8 g three times per day (2.4 g/day) increments every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus 
level is reached, with regular monitoring thereafter. 
In clinical practice, treatment will be continuous based on the need to control serum phosphorus levels and 
the daily adult dose is expected to be an average of approximately 6 g per day. 
**Children and adolescents (>6 years of age and a BSA of >0.75m2) 
For paediatric patients, serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate 
titrated in increments based on patient’s BSA, three times per day every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum 
phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring thereafter.

Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly population. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Renvela in children below the age of 6 years or in children with a BSA below 0.75 
m2 have not been established. No data are available. 
For paediatric patients with a <1.2 BSA (m2), the oral suspension should be administered, as tablet 
formulations were not tested in this population and therefore are not appropriate for this population. 
Method of administration: 
Oral use. 
Each sachet of 0.8 g of powder is to be dispersed in 30 mL of water prior to administration (see section 6.6).

4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Hypophosphataemia  
Bowel obstruction.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in adult patients with chronic 
kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus < 1.78 mmol/l. Therefore it is currently not 
recommended for use in these patients. 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in patients with the following 
disorders: 
• 
• 
• 
dysphagia 
swallowing disorders 
severe gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, retention of 
gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion 
• 
active inflammatory bowel disease 
•  major gastrointestinal tract surgery 
Treatment of these patients with Renvela should only be initiated after careful benefit/risk assessment. If the 
therapy is initiated, patients suffering from these disorders should be monitored.  Renvela treatment should 
be reevaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus 
In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment 
with sevelamer hydrochloride (capsules/tablets), which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer 
carbonate. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored 
carefully while being treated with Renvela. The treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop 
severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Fat-soluble vitamins and folate deficiency 
Patients with CKD may develop low levels of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, depending on dietary 
intake and the severity of their disease. It cannot be excluded that sevelamer carbonate can bind fat-soluble 
vitamins contained in ingested food. In patients not taking supplemental vitamins but on sevelamer, serum 
vitamin A, D, E and K status should be assessed regularly. It is recommended that vitamin supplements be 
given if necessary. It is recommended that CKD patients not on dialysis are given vitamin D supplements 
(approximately 400 IU of native vitamin D daily) which can be part of a multivitamin preparation to be taken 
apart from their dose of sevelamer carbonate. In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis additional 
monitoring of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid is recommended, since vitamin A, D, E and K levels were 
not measured in a clinical study in these patients. 
There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term sevelamer 
carbonate treatment. In patients not taking supplemental folic acid but on sevelamer, folate level should be 
assessed regularly. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia 
Patients with CKD may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Sevelamer carbonate does not contain 
any calcium. Serum calcium levels should therefore be monitored at regular intervals and elemental calcium 
should be given as a supplement if required.  
Metabolic acidosis 
Patients with CKD are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis. As part of good clinical practice, 
monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore recommended. 
Peritonitis 
Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to dialysis modality. Peritonitis is 
a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and in a clinical trial with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, a greater number of peritonitis cases were reported in the sevelamer group than in the control 
group. Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the correct use of appropriate 
aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with 
peritonitis. 
Hypothyroidism 
Closer monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer carbonate and 
levothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hyperparathyroidism 
Sevelamer carbonate is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. 
Inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders  
Cases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including serious 
complications such as haemorrhage, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis and colonic/caecal mass) 
associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported (see section 4.8). Inflammatory 
disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Sevelamer carbonate treatment should be re-
evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dialysis 
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. 
Ciprofloxacin 
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-
administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, sevelamer carbonate 
should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. 
Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients 
Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant 
patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (e.g., graft 
rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood 
concentrations of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of 
combination and after its withdrawal.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Levothyroxine 
Very rare cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients co-administered with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, and levothyroxine. Closer 
monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving 
sevelamer carbonate and levothyroxine. 
Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products 
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal 
products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, possible reduction 
in absorption cannot be excluded. The anti-arrhythmic medicinal product should be taken at least one hour 
before or three hours after Renvela and blood monitoring can be considered. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in 
patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer carbonate. Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing PPI to patients concomitantly treated with Renvela. The phosphate serum level 
should be monitored and the Renvela dosage adjusted consequently. 
Bioavailability 
Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering  any  medicinal  product  where  a  reduction  in  the  bioavailability  could  have  a  clinically 
significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before 
or three hours after sevelamer carbonate, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 
Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sevelamer in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown some reproductive toxicity when sevelamer was administered to rats at high doses (see section 5.3). 
Sevelamer has also been shown to reduce the absorption of several vitamins including folic acid (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. Sevelamer carbonate should only be given to 
pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the 
mother and the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sevelamer/metabolites are excreted in human milk. The non-absorbed nature of 
sevelamer indicates that excretion of sevelamer in breast milk is unlikely.  A decision on whether to 
continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with sevelamer carbonate should be 
made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of sevelamer carbonate 
therapy to the woman.  
Fertility 
There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown that 
sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose 2 times the 
maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently occurring (≥ 5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal disorders 
system organ class. Most of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of sevelamer (as either carbonate and hydrochloride salts) has been investigated in numerous 
clinical trials involving a total of 969 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of 4 to 50 weeks 
(724 patients treated with sevelamer hydrochloride and 245 with sevelamer carbonate), 97 peritoneal dialysis 
patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks (all treated with sevelamer hydrochloride) and 128 patients with 
CKD not on dialysis with treatment duration of 8 to 12 weeks (79 patients treatment with sevelamer 
hydrochloride and 49 with sevelamer carbonate). 
Adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials or that were spontaneously reported from post-
marketing experience are listed by frequency in the table below. The reporting rate is classified as very 
common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

In general, the safety profile for children and adolescents (6 to 18 years of age) is similar to the safety profile 
for adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been given to 
normal healthy volunteers in doses of up to 14 grams per day for eight days with no adverse reactions. In 
CKD patients, the maximum average daily dose studied was 14.4 grams of sevelamer carbonate in a single 
daily dose. 
The symptoms observed in case of overdose are similar to adverse reactions listed in section 4.8, including 
mainly constipation and other known gastrointestinal disorders. 
Appropriate symptomatic treatment should be provided. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and 
hyperphosphataemia. ATC code: V03A E02. 
Mechanism of action 
Renvela contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and 
calcium. Sevelamer contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone which 
become protonated in the stomach. These protonated amines bind negatively charged ions such as dietary 
phosphate in the intestine.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer lowers the 
phosphorus concentration in the serum. Regular monitoring of serum phosphorus levels is always necessary 
during phosphate binder administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In two randomised, cross over clinical trials, sevelamer carbonate has been shown to be therapeutically 
equivalent to sevelamer hydrochloride and therefore effective in controlling serum phosphorus in CKD 
patients on haemodialysis.  These also demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate in both tablet and powder 
formulations are therapeutically equivalent to sevelamer hydrochloride. 
The first study demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times per day was equivalent to 
sevelamer hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 79 haemodialysis patients treated over two 
randomised 8 week treatment periods (mean serum phosphorus time-weighted averages were 
1.5 ± 0.3 mmol/l for both sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride). The second study 
demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate powder dosed three times per day was equivalent to sevelamer 
hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 31 hyperphosphataemic (defined as serum phosphorus 
levels ≥ 1.78 mmol/l) haemodialysis patients over two randomised 4 week treatment periods (mean serum 
phosphorus time-weighted averages were 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/l for sevelamer carbonate powder and 1.7 ± 
0.4 mmol/l for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets). 
In the clinical trials in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and clinically 
significant effect on iPTH. In the 12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH 
reductions were seen compared with patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the iPTH levels. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile acid 
binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In clinical trials 
of sevelamer, both the mean total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol declined by 15-39%. The decrease in 
cholesterol has been observed after 2 weeks of treatment and is maintained with long-term treatment. 
Triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and albumin levels did not change following sevelamer treatment. 
Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, 
E and K. 
Sevelamer does not contain calcium and decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to 
patients using calcium based phosphate binders alone. The effects of sevelamer on phosphorus and calcium 
were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year follow-up. This information was obtained 
from studies in which sevelamer hydrochloride was used. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of sevelamer carbonate in hyperphosphatemic paediatric patients with CKD was 
evaluated in a multicenter study with a 2-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed dose period (FDP) 
followed by a 6-month, single-arm, open-label, dose titration period (DTP). A total of 101 patients (6 to 18 
years old with a BSA range of 0.8 m2  to 2.4 m2) were randomised in the study. Forty-nine (49) patients 
received sevelamer carbonate and 51 received placebo during the 2 week FDP. Thereafter all patients 
received sevelamer carbonate for the 26-week DTP. The study met its primary endpoint, meaning Sevelamer 
carbonate reduced serum phosphorus by an LS mean difference of  0.90 mg/dL compared to placebo, and 
secondary efficacy endpoints. In paediatric patients with hyperphosphatemia secondary to CKD, sevelamer 
carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus levels compared to placebo during a 2-week FDP. The 
treatment response was maintained in the paediatric patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-
month open-label DTP. 27% of paediatric patients reached their age appropriate serum phosphorus level at 
end of treatment. These figures were 23% and 15% in the subgroup of patients on hemodialysis and 
peritoneal dialysis, respectively. The treatment response during the 2-week FDP was not affected by BSA, in 
contrast however, no treatment response was observed in paediatric patients with qualifying phosphorus 
levels <7.0 mg/dL. Most of adverse events reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate 
were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer 
carbonate during the study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out with sevelamer carbonate. Sevelamer hydrochloride, 
which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract, as confirmed by an absorption study in healthy volunteers. 
In a clinical trial of one year, no evidence of accumulation of sevelamer was seen. However the potential 
absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment (> one year) cannot be totally 
excluded. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data with sevelamer reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity.  
Carcinogenicity studies with oral sevelamer hydrochloride were conducted in mice (doses of up to 
9 g/kg/day) and rats (0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day). There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional 
cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial 
dose of 14.4 g). There was no increased incidence of tumours observed in mice (human equivalent dose 
3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a 
statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer 
hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. 
In rats and dogs, sevelamer reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K (coagulation factors), and 
folic acid. 
Deficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in foetuses of female rats dosed with 
sevelamer at intermediate and high doses (human equivalent dose less than the maximum clinical trial dose 
of 14.4 g). The effects may be secondary to vitamin D depletion. 
In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase 
of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical 
trial dose). 
Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study 
in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated 
for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 2 times 
the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. 
Renvela is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) not on dialysis with serum phosphorus ≥ 1.78 mmol/l. 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients (>6 years of age and a body 
surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease. 
Renvela should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium 
supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone 
disease. 
4.2      Posology and method of administration

For patients previously on phosphate binders (sevelamer hydrochloride or calcium based), Renvela should be 
given on a gram for gram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. 
Titration and maintenance 
*Adults 
For adult patients, serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate titrated 
by 0.8 g three times per day (2.4 g/day) increments every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus 
level is reached, with regular monitoring thereafter. 
In clinical practice, treatment will be continuous based on the need to control serum phosphorus levels and 
the daily adult dose is expected to be an average of approximately 6 g per day. 
**Children and adolescents (>6 years of age and a BSA of >0.75m2) 
For paediatric patients, serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate 
titrated in increments based on patient’s BSA, three times per day every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum 
phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring thereafter.

Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly population. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Renvela in children below the age of 6 years or in children with a BSA below 0.75 
m2 have not been established. No data are available  
For paediatric patients with a <1.2 BSA (m2), the oral suspension should be administered, as tablet 
formulations were not tested in this population and therefore are not appropriate for this population.   
Method of administration: 
Oral use. 
Each sachet of 1.6 g of powder is to be dispersed in 40 mL of water prior to administration (see section 6.6). 
The suspension should be ingested within 30 minutes after being prepared. Renvela should be taken with

4.3      Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Hypophosphataemia  
Bowel obstruction.  
4.4      Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in adult patients with chronic 
kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus < 1.78 mmol/l.  Therefore it is currently not 
recommended for use in these patients. 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in patients with the following 
disorders: 
• 
• 
• 
dysphagia 
swallowing disorders 
severe gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, retention of 
gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion 
• 
active inflammatory bowel disease 
•  major gastrointestinal tract surgery 
Treatment of these patients with Renvela should only be initiated after careful benefit/risk assessment. If the 
therapy is initiated, patients suffering from these disorders should be monitored.  Renvela treatment should 
be reevaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus 
In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment 
with sevelamer hydrochloride (capsules/tablets), which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer 
carbonate. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored 
carefully while being treated with Renvela. The treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop 
severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Fat-soluble vitamins and folate deficiency 
Patients with CKD may develop low levels of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, depending on dietary 
intake and the severity of their disease. It cannot be excluded that sevelamer carbonate can bind fat-soluble 
vitamins contained in ingested food. In patients not taking supplemental vitamins but on sevelamer, serum 
vitamin A, D, E and K status should be assessed regularly. It is recommended that vitamin supplements be 
given if necessary. It is recommended that CKD patients not on dialysis are given vitamin D supplements 
(approximately 400 IU of native vitamin D daily) which can be part of a multivitamin preparation to be taken 
apart from their dose of sevelamer carbonate. In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis additional 
monitoring of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid is recommended, since vitamin A, D, E and K levels were 
not measured in a clinical study in these patients. 
There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term sevelamer 
carbonate treatment. In patients not taking supplemental folic acid but on sevelamer, folate level should be 
assessed regularly. 
Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia 
Patients with CKD may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Sevelamer carbonate does not contain 
any calcium. Serum calcium levels should therefore be monitored at regular intervals and elemental calcium 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be given as a supplement if required.  
Metabolic acidosis 
Patients with CKD are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis. As part of good clinical practice, 
monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore recommended. 
Peritonitis 
Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to dialysis modality. Peritonitis is 
a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and in a clinical trial with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, a greater number of peritonitis cases were reported in the sevelamer group than in the control 
group. Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the correct use of appropriate 
aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with 
peritonitis. 
Hypothyroidism 
Closer monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer carbonate and 
levothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hyperparathyroidism 
Sevelamer carbonate is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25 - dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. 
Inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders  
Cases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including serious 
complications such as haemorrhage, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis and colonic/caecal mass) 
associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported (see section 4.8). Inflammatory 
disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Sevelamer carbonate treatment should be re-
evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms.  
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dialysis 
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. 
Ciprofloxacin 
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-
administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, sevelamer carbonate 
should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. 
Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients 
Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant 
patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (e.g., graft 
rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood 
concentrations of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of 
combination and after its withdrawal.  
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Levothyroxine 
Very rare cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients co-administered with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, and levothyroxine. Closer 
monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving 
sevelamer carbonate and levothyroxine. 
Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products 
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal 
products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, possible reduction 
in absorption cannot be excluded. The anti-arrhythmic medicinal product should be taken at least one hour 
before or three hours after Renvela and blood monitoring can be considered. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in 
patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer carbonate. Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing PPI to patients concomitantly treated with Renvela. The phosphate serum level 
should be monitored and the Renvela dosage adjusted consequently. 
Bioavailability 
Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering  any  medicinal  product  where  a  reduction  in  the  bioavailability  could  have  a  clinically 
significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before 
or three hours after sevelamer carbonate, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 
Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sevelamer in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown some reproductive toxicity when sevelamer was administered to rats at high doses (see section 5.3). 
Sevelamer has also been shown to reduce the absorption of several vitamins including folic acid (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. Sevelamer carbonate should only be given to 
pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the 
mother and the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sevelamer/metabolites are excreted in human milk. The non-absorbed nature of 
sevelamer indicates that excretion of sevelamer in breast milk is unlikely.  A decision on whether to 
continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with sevelamer carbonate should be 
made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of sevelamer 
carbonatetherapy to the woman.  
Fertility 
There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown that 
sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose 2 times the 
maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8      Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently occurring (≥ 5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal disorders 
system organ class. Most of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of sevelamer (as either carbonate and hydrochloride salts) has been investigated in numerous 
clinical trials involving a total of 969 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of 4 to 50 weeks 
(724 patients treated with sevelamer hydrochloride and 245 with sevelamer carbonate), 97 peritoneal dialysis 
patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks (all treated with sevelamer hydrochloride) and 128 patients with 
CKD not on dialysis with treatment duration of 8 to 12 weeks (79 patients treatment with sevelamer 
hydrochloride and 49 with sevelamer carbonate). 
Adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials or that were spontaneously reported from post-
marketing experience are listed by frequency in the table below. The reporting rate is classified as very 
common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

4.9     Overdose 
Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been given to 
normal healthy volunteers in doses of up to 14 grams per day for eight days with no adverse reactions. In 
CKD patients, the maximum average daily dose studied was 14.4 grams of sevelamer carbonate in a single 
daily dose. 
The symptoms observed in case of overdose are similar to adverse reactions listed in section 4.8, including 
mainly constipation and other known gastrointestinal disorders. 
Appropriate symptomatic treatment should be provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and 
hyperphosphataemia. ATC code: V03A E02. 
Mechanism of action 
Renvela contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and 
calcium. Sevelamer contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone which 
become protonated in the stomach. These protonated amines bind negatively charged ions such as dietary 
phosphate in the intestine.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer lowers the 
phosphorus concentration in the serum. Regular monitoring of serum phosphorus levels is always necessary 
during phosphate binder administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In two randomised, cross over clinical trials, sevelamer carbonate has been shown to be therapeutically 
equivalent to sevelamer hydrochloride and therefore effective in controlling serum phosphorus in CKD 
patients on haemodialysis.  These also demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate in both tablet and powder 
formulations are therapeutically equivalent to sevelamer hydrochloride. 
The first study demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times per day was equivalent to 
sevelamer hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 79 haemodialysis patients treated over two 
randomised 8 week treatment periods (mean serum phosphorus time-weighted averages were 
1.5 ± 0.3 mmol/l for both sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride). The second study 
demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate powder dosed three times per day was equivalent to sevelamer 
hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 31 hyperphosphataemic (defined as serum phosphorus 
levels ≥ 1.78 mmol/l) haemodialysis patients over two randomised 4 week treatment periods (mean serum 
phosphorus time-weighted averages were 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/l for sevelamer carbonate powder and 1.7 ± 
0.4 mmol/l for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets). 
In the clinical trials in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and clinically 
significant effect on  iPTH. In the 12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar 
iPTH reductions were seen compared with patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the iPTH levels. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile acid 
binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In clinical trials 
of sevelamer, both the mean total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol declined by 15-39%. The decrease in 
cholesterol has been observed after 2 weeks of treatment and is maintained with long-term treatment. 
Triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and albumin levels did not change following sevelamer treatment. 
Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, 
E and K. 
Sevelamer does not contain calcium and decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to 
patients using calcium based phosphate binders alone. The effects of sevelamer on phosphorus and calcium 
were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year follow-up. This information was obtained 
from studies in which sevelamer hydrochloride was used. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of sevelamer carbonate in hyperphosphatemic paediatric patients with CKD was 
evaluated in a multicenter study with a 2-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed dose period (FDP) 
followed by a 6-month, single-arm, open-label, dose titration period (DTP). A total of 101 patients (6 to 18 
years old with a BSA range of 0.8 m2 to 2.4 m2) were randomised in the study. Forty-nine (49) patients 
received sevelamer carbonate and 51 received placebo during the 2 week FDP. Thereafter all patients 
received sevelamer carbonate for the 26-week DTP. The study met its primary endpoint, meaning Sevelamer 
carbonate reduced serum phosphorus by an LS mean difference of 0.90 mg/dL compared to placebo, and 
secondary efficacy endpoints. In paediatric patients with hyperphosphatemia secondary to CKD, sevelamer 
carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus levels compared to placebo during a 2-week FDP. The 
treatment response was maintained in the paediatric patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-
month open-label DTP. 27% of paediatric patients reached their age appropriate serum phosphorus level at 
end of treatment. These figures were 23% and 15% in the subgroup of patients on hemodialysis and 
peritoneal dialysis, respectively. The treatment response during the 2-week FDP was not affected by BSA, in 
contrast however, no treatment response was observed in paediatric patients with qualifying phosphorus 
levels <7.0 mg/dL. Most of adverse events reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate 
were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer 
carbonate during the study. 
5.2       Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out with sevelamer carbonate. Sevelamer hydrochloride, 
which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract, as confirmed by an absorption study in healthy volunteers. 
In a clinical trial of one year, no evidence of accumulation of sevelamer was seen. However the potential 
absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment (> one year) cannot be totally 
excluded. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data with sevelamer reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity.  
Carcinogenicity studies with oral sevelamer hydrochloride were conducted in mice (doses of up to 
9 g/kg/day) and rats (0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day). There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional 
cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial 
dose of 14.4 g). There was no increased incidence of tumours observed in mice (human equivalent dose 
3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a 
statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer 
hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. 
In rats and dogs, sevelamer reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K (coagulation factors), and 
folic acid. 
Deficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in foetuses of female rats dosed with 
sevelamer at intermediate and high doses (human equivalent dose less than the maximum clinical trial dose 
of 14.4 g). The effects may be secondary to vitamin D depletion. 
In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase 
of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical 
trial dose). 
Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study 
in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated 
for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 2 times 
the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. 
Renvela is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) not on dialysis with serum phosphorus ≥ 1.78 mmol/l. 
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients (>6 years of age and a body 
surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease. 
Renvela should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium 
supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone 
disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology

For patients previously on phosphate binders (sevelamer hydrochloride or calcium based), Renvela should be 
given on a gram for gram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. 
Titration and maintenance 
*Adults 
For adult patients, serum phosphorus must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate titrated by 0.8 
g three times per day (2.4 g/day) increments every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is 
reached, with regular monitoring thereafter. 
In clinical practice, treatment will be continuous based on the need to control serum phosphorus levels and 
the daily adult dose is expected to be an average of approximately 6 g per day. 
**Children and adolescents (>6 years of age and a BSA of >0.75m2) 
For paediatric patients, serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate 
titrated in increments based on patient’s BSA, three times per day every 2-4 weeks until an acceptable serum 
phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring thereafter.

Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly population. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Renvela in children below the age of 6 years or in children with a BSA below 0.75 
m2 have not been established. No data are available. 
For paediatric patients with a <1.2 BSA (m2), the oral suspension should be administered, as tablet 
formulations were not tested in this population and therefore are not appropriate for this population.    
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Each sachet of 2.4 g of powder is to be dispersed in 60 mL of water prior to administration (see section 6.6). 
The suspension should be ingested within 30 minutes after being prepared. Renvela should be taken with food 
and not on an empty stomach. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As an alternative to water, the powder may be pre-mixed with a small amount of beverage or food (e.g. 100 
grams/120 ml) and consumed within 30 minutes. Do not heat Renvela powder (e.g. microwave) or add to 
heated foods or liquids. 
If a dose of 0.4 g is to be administered, please use the dedicated 0.8 g powder presentation with dosing spoon. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Hypophosphataemia  
Bowel obstruction.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in adult patients with chronic 
kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus < 1.78 mmol/l.  Therefore it is currently not 
recommended for use in these patients. 
The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in patients with the following 
disorders: 
• 
• 
• 
dysphagia 
swallowing disorders 
severe gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, retention of 
gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion 
• 
active inflammatory bowel disease 
•  major gastrointestinal tract surgery 
Treatment of these patients with Renvela should only be initiated after careful benefit/risk assessment. If the 
therapy is initiated, patients suffering from these disorders should be monitored.  Renvela treatment should 
be reevaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus 
In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment 
with sevelamer hydrochloride (capsules/tablets), which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer 
carbonate. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored 
carefully while being treated with Renvela. The treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop 
severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Fat-soluble vitamins and folate deficiency 
Patients with CKD may develop low levels of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, depending on dietary 
intake and the severity of their disease. It cannot be excluded that sevelamer carbonate can bind fat-soluble 
vitamins contained in ingested food. In patients not taking supplemental vitamins but on sevelamer, serum 
vitamin A, D, E and K status should be assessed regularly. It is recommended that vitamin supplements be 
given if necessary. It is recommended that CKD patients not on dialysis are given vitamin D supplements 
(approximately 400 IU of native vitamin D daily) which can be part of a multivitamin preparation to be taken 
apart from their dose of sevelamer carbonate. In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis additional 
monitoring of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid is recommended, since vitamin A, D, E and K levels were 
not measured in a clinical study in these patients. 
There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term sevelamer 
carbonate treatment. In patients not taking supplemental folic acid but on sevelamer, folate level should be 
assessed regularly. 
Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia 
Patients with CKD may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Sevelamer carbonate does not contain 
any calcium. Serum calcium levels should therefore be monitored at regular intervals and elemental calcium 
should be given as a supplement if required.  
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolic acidosis 
Patients with CKD are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis. As part of good clinical practice, 
monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore recommended. 
Peritonitis 
Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to dialysis modality. Peritonitis is 
a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and in a clinical trial with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, a greater number of peritonitis cases were reported in the sevelamer group than in the control 
group. Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the correct use of appropriate 
aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with 
peritonitis. 
Hypothyroidism 
Closer monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer carbonate and 
levothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hyperparathyroidism 
Sevelamer carbonate is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. 
Inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders  
Cases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including serious 
complications such as haemorrhage, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis and colonic/caecal mass) 
associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported (see section 4.8). Inflammatory 
disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Sevelamer carbonate treatment should be re-
evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dialysis 
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. 
Ciprofloxacin 
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-
administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, sevelamer carbonate 
should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. 
Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients 
Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant 
patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (e.g., graft 
rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood 
concentrations of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of 
combination and after its withdrawal.  
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Levothyroxine  
Very rare cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients co-administered with sevelamer 
hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, and levothyroxine. Closer 
monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving 
sevelamer carbonate and levothyroxine. 
Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products 
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal 
products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, possible reduction 
in absorption cannot be excluded. The anti-arrhythmic medical product should be taken at least one hour 
before or three hours after Renvela and blood monitoring can be considered. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in 
patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer carbonate. Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing PPI to patients concomitantly treated with Renvela. The phosphate serum level 
should be monitored and the Renvela dosage adjusted consequently. 
Bioavailability 
Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering  any  medicinal  product  where  a  reduction  in  the  bioavailability  could  have  a  clinically 
significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before 
or three hours after sevelamer carbonate, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 
Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety 
as sevelamer carbonate, had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sevelamer in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown some reproductive toxicity when sevelamer was administered to rats at high doses (see section 5.3). 
Sevelamer has also been shown to reduce the absorption of several vitamins including folic acid (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. Sevelamer carbonate should only be given to 
pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the 
mother and the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sevelamer/metabolites are excreted in human milk. The non-absorbed nature of 
sevelamer indicates that excretion of sevelamer in breast milk is unlikely.  A decision on whether to 
continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with sevelamer carbonate should be 
made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of sevelamer carbonate 
therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown that 
sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose 2 times the 
maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8       Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently occurring (≥ 5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal disorders 
system organ class. Most of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of sevelamer (as either carbonate and hydrochloride salts) has been investigated in numerous 
clinical trials involving a total of 969 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of 4 to 50 weeks 
(724 patients treated with sevelamer hydrochloride and 245 with sevelamer carbonate), 97 peritoneal dialysis 
patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks (all treated with sevelamer hydrochloride) and 128 patients with 
CKD not on dialysis with treatment duration of 8 to 12 weeks (79 patients treatment with sevelamer 
hydrochloride and 49 with sevelamer carbonate). 
Adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials or that were spontaneously reported from post-
marketing experience are listed by frequency in the table below. The reporting rate is classified as very 
common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

4.9      Overdose 
Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been given to 
normal healthy volunteers in doses of up to 14 grams per day for eight days with no adverse reactions. In 
CKD patients, the maximum average daily dose studied was 14.4 grams of sevelamer carbonate in a single 
daily dose. 
The symptoms observed in case of overdose are similar to adverse reactions listed in section 4.8, including 
mainly constipation and other known gastrointestinal disorders. 
Appropriate symptomatic treatment should be provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and 
hyperphosphataemia.  ATC code: V03A E02. 
Mechanism of action 
Renvela contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and 
calcium. Sevelamer contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone which 
become protonated in the stomach. These protonated amines bind negatively charged ions such as dietary 
phosphate in the intestine.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer lowers the 
phosphorus concentration in the serum. Regular monitoring of serum phosphorus levels is always necessary 
during phosphate binder administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In two randomised, cross over clinical trials, sevelamer carbonate has been shown to be therapeutically 
equivalent to sevelamer hydrochloride and therefore effective in controlling serum phosphorus in CKD 
patients on haemodialysis.  These also demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate in both tablet and powder 
formulations are therapeutically equivalent to sevelamer hydrochloride. 
The first study demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times per day was equivalent to 
sevelamer hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 79 haemodialysis patients treated over two 
randomised 8 week treatment periods (mean serum phosphorus time-weighted averages were 
1.5 ± 0.3 mmol/l for both sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride). The second study 
demonstrated that sevelamer carbonate powder dosed three times per day was equivalent to sevelamer 
hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day in 31 hyperphosphataemic (defined as serum phosphorus 
levels ≥ 1.78 mmol/l) haemodialysis patients over two randomised 4 week treatment periods (mean serum 
phosphorus time-weighted averages were 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/l for sevelamer carbonate powder and 
1.7 ± 0.4 mmol/l for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets). 
In the clinical trials in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and clinically 
significant effect on iPTH. In a 12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH 
reductions were seen compared with patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism sevelamer carbonate should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic 
approach, which could include calcium as supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues 
to lower the iPTH levels. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile acid 
binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In clinical trials 
of sevelamer, both the mean total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol declined by 15-39%. The decrease in 
cholesterol has been observed after 2 weeks of treatment and is maintained with long-term treatment. 
Triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and albumin levels did not change following sevelamer treatment. 
Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, 
E and K. 
Sevelamer does not contain calcium and decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to 
patients using calcium based phosphate binders alone. The effects of sevelamer on phosphorus and calcium 
were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year follow-up. This information was obtained 
from studies in which sevelamer hydrochloride was used. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of sevelamer carbonate in hyperphosphatemic paediatric patients with CKD was 
evaluated in a multicenter study with a 2-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed dose period (FDP) 
followed by a 6-month, single-arm, open-label, dose titration period (DTP). A total of 101 patients (6 to 18 
years old with a BSA range of 0.8 m2 to 2.4 m2) were randomised in the study. Forty-nine (49) patients 
received sevelamer carbonate and 51 received placebo during the 2 week FDP. Thereafter all patients 
received sevelamer carbonate for the 26-week DTP. The study met its primary endpoint, meaning Sevelamer 
carbonate reduced serum phosphorus by an LS mean difference of 0.90 mg/dL compared to placebo, and 
secondary efficacy endpoints. In paediatric patients with hyperphosphatemia secondary to CKD, sevelamer 
carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus levels compared to placebo during a 2-week FDP. The 
treatment response was maintained in the paediatric patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-
month open-label DTP. 27% of paediatric patients reached their age appropriate serum phosphorus level at 
end of treatment. These figures were 23% and 15% in the subgroup of patients on hemodialysis and 
peritoneal dialysis, respectively. The treatment response during the 2-week FDP was not affected by BSA, in 
contrast however, no treatment response was observed in paediatric patients with qualifying phosphorus 
levels <7.0 mg/dL. Most of adverse events reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate 
were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer 
carbonate during the study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out with sevelamer carbonate. Sevelamer hydrochloride, 
which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract, as confirmed by an absorption study in healthy volunteers. 
In a clinical trial of one year, no evidence of accumulation of sevelamer was seen. However the potential 
absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment (> one year) cannot be totally 
excluded.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data with sevelamer reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity.  
Carcinogenicity studies with oral sevelamer hydrochloride were conducted in mice (doses of up to 
9 g/kg/day) and rats (0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day). There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional 
cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial 
dose of 14.4 g). There was no increased incidence of tumours observed in mice (human equivalent dose 
3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a 
statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer 
hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. 
In rats and dogs, sevelamer reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K (coagulation factors), and 
folic acid. 
Deficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in foetuses of female rats dosed with 
sevelamer at intermediate and high doses (human equivalent dose less than the maximum clinical trial dose 
of 14.4 g). The effects may be secondary to vitamin D depletion. 
In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase 
of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical 
trial dose). 
Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study 
in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated 
for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 2 times 
the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative BSA).

Renvela 800 mg film-coated tablets 
sevelamer carbonate 
Read  all  of  this  leaflet  carefully  before  you  start  taking  this  medicine  because  it  contains  important 
information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
- 
-  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if 
If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
- 
their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to you doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet.  See section 4.

4. Possible side effects 
5. How to store Renvela 
6. Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Renvela is and what it is used for 
Renvela contains sevelamer carbonate as the active substance. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive 
tract and so reduces serum phosphorus levels in the blood. 
This medicine is used to control hyperphosphataemia (high blood phosphate levels) in: 
• 
adult  patients  on  dialysis  (a  blood  clearance  technique).  It  can  be  used  in  patients  undergoing 
haemodialysis (using a blood filtration machine) or peritoneal dialysis (where fluid is pumped into the 
abdomen and an internal body membrane filters the blood); 
patients  with  chronic  (long-term)  kidney  disease  who  are  not  on  dialysis  and  have  a  serum  (blood) 
phosphorus level equal to or above 1.78 mmol/l. 
• 
This medicine should be used with other treatments such as calcium supplements and vitamin D to prevent 
the development of bone disease. 
Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard deposits in your body called calcification. These 
deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. 
Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Renvela 
Do not take Renvela if: 
• 
you  are allergic  to  the  active  substance  or  to  any  of  the  other  ingredients  of  this  medicine  (listed  in 
section 6). 
you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you) 
you have bowel obstruction  
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Renvela if any of the following applies to you: 
• swallowing problems. Your doctor can rather prescribe Renvela powder for oral suspension 
• problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
• being sick frequently 
• active inflammation of the bowel 
• have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor while taking Renvela: 
• 
if  you  experience  severe  abdominal  pain,  stomach  or  intestine  disorders,  or  blood  in  the  stool 
(gastrointestinal  bleeding).  These  symptoms  can  be  due  to  serious  inflammatory  bowel  disease 
caused  by  sevelamer  crystals  deposit  in  your  bowel.  Contact  your  doctor  who  will  decide  on 
continuing the treatment or not. 
Additional treatments 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
•  develop  low  or  high  levels  of  calcium  in  your  blood.  Since  this  medicine  does  not  contain  calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
•  have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of 
vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your 
blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as 
necessary. 
•  have disturbed level of bicarbonate in your blood and increased acidity in the blood and other body 
tissue. Your doctor should monitor the level of bicarbonate in your blood. 
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis. 
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You should tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, 
abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  
Children 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 6 years) have not been studied. Therefore this medicine 
is not recommended for use in children below the age of 6 years. 
Other medicines and Renvela 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
•  Renvela should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). 
•  If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor 
when taking Renvela. 
•  The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used 
to suppress the immune system) may be reduced by Renvela. Your doctor will advise you if you are 
taking these medicines. 
•  Thyroid hormone deficiency may uncommonly be observed in certain people taking levothyroxine 
(used to treat low thyroid hormone levels) and Renvela. Therefore your doctor may monitor the levels 
of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood more closely. 
• Medicines treating heartburn and reflux from your stomach or oesophagus, such as omeprazole, 
pantoprazole, or lansoprazole, known as “proton pump inhibitors”, may reduce the efficacy of 
Renvela.  Your doctor may monitor the phosphate level in your blood. 
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renvela and other medicines on a regular basis. 
In some cases where Renvela should be taken at the same time as another medicine. Your doctor may advise 
you  to  take  this  medicine  1 hour  before  or  3 hours  after  Renvela  intake.  Your  doctor  may  also  consider 
monitoring the levels of that medicine in your blood. 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  
The potential risk of Renvela during human pregnancy is unknown. Talk to your doctor who will decide if 
you can continue the treatment with Renvela. 
It is unknown whether Renvela is excreted in breast milk and may affect your baby. Talk to your doctor who 
will decide if you can breastfeed your baby or not, and if it is necessary to stop Renvela treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Renvela is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Renvela 
You  must  take  Renvela  as  prescribed  by  your  doctor.  They  will  base  the  dose  on  your  serum  phosphorus 
level.  
The recommended starting dose of Renvela tablets for adults and elderly is one to two tablets of 800 mg with 
each meal, 3 times a day. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Take Renvela after your meal or with food. 
The tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces. 
Initially, your doctor will check the levels of phosphorus in your blood every 2-4 weeks and may adjust the 
dose of Renvela when necessary to reach an adequate phosphate level.  
Follow the diet prescribed by your doctor. 
If you take more Renvela than you should 
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Renvela 
If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the usual time 
with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Renvela 
Taking  your  Renvela  treatment  is  important  to  maintain  an  appropriate  phosphate  level  in  your  blood. 
Stopping  Renvela  would  lead  to  important  consequences  such  as  calcification  in  the  blood  vessels.  If  you 
consider stopping your Renvela treatment, contact your doctor or pharmacist first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1.  What Renvela is and what it is used for 
Renvela contains sevelamer carbonate as the active substance. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive 
tract and so reduces serum phosphorus levels in the blood. 
This medicine is used to control hyperphosphataemia (high blood phosphate levels) in: 
• 
adult  patients  on  dialysis  (a  blood  clearance  technique).  It  can  be  used  in  patients  undergoing 
haemodialysis (using a blood filtration machine) or peritoneal dialysis (where fluid is pumped into the 
abdomen and an internal body membrane filters the blood); 
adult  patients  with  chronic  (long-term)  kidney  disease  who  are  not  on  dialysis  and  have  a  serum 
(blood) phosphorus level equal to or above 1.78 mmol/l. 
paediatric  patients  with  chronic  (long-term)  kidney  disease  above  the  age  of  6  and  above  a  certain 
height and weight (used to calculate body surface area by your physician). 
• 
• 
This medicine should be used with other treatments such as calcium supplements and vitamin D to prevent 
the development of bone disease. 
Increased  levels  of  serum  phosphorus  can  lead  to  hard  deposits  in  your  body  called  calcification.  These 
deposits  can  stiffen  your  blood  vessels  and  make  it  harder  for  blood  to  be  pumped  around  the  body. 
Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Renvela 
Do not take Renvela if: 
• 
you  are allergic  to  the  active  substance  or  to  any  of  the  other  ingredients  of  this  medicine  (listed  in 
section 6). 
you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you) 
you have bowel obstruction  
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to you doctor before taking Renvela if any of the following applies to you: 
• problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
• being sick frequently 
• active inflammation of the bowel 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel 
Talk to your doctor while taking Renvela: 
• 
if  you  experience  severe  abdominal  pain,  stomach  or  intestine  disorders,  or  blood  in  the  stool 
(gastrointestinal  bleeding).  These  symptoms  can  be  due  to  serious  inflammatory  bowel  disease 
caused  by  sevelamer  crystals  deposit  in  your  bowel.  Contact  your  doctor  who  will  decide  on 
continuing the treatment or not. 
Additional treatments 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
•  develop  low  or  high  levels  of  calcium  in  your  blood.  Since  this  medicine  does  not  contain  calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
•  have  a  low  amount  of  vitamin  D  in  your  blood.  Therefore,  your  doctor  may  monitor  the  levels  of 
vitamin  D  in  your  blood  and  prescribe  additional  vitamin  D  as  necessary.  If  you  do  not  take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your 
blood  and  therefore  your  doctor  may  monitor  these  levels  and  prescribe  supplemental  vitamins  as 
necessary.  
•  have disturbed level of bicarbonate in your blood and increased acidity in the blood and other body 
tissue. Your doctor should monitor the level of bicarbonate in your blood. 
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis. 
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You should tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, 
abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  
Children 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of   6 years) have not been studied. Therefore this 
medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 6 years. 
Other medicines and Renvela 
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
•  Renvela should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). 
•  If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor 
when taking Renvela. 
•  The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used 
to suppress the immune system) may be reduced by Renvela. Your doctor will advise you if you are 
taking these medicines. 
•  Thyroid hormone deficiency may uncommonly be observed in certain people taking levothyroxine 
(used to treat low thyroid hormone levels) and Renvela. Therefore your doctor may monitor the levels 
of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood more closely.  
•  Medicines treating heartburn and reflux from your stomach or oesophagus, such as omeprazole, 
pantoprazole, or lansoprazole, known as “proton pump inhibitors”, may reduce the efficacy of 
Renvela. Your doctor may monitor the phosphate level in your blood. 
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renvela and other medicines on a regular basis. 
In some cases where Renvela should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may advise 
you  to  take  this  medicine  1 hour  before  or  3 hours  after  Renvela  intake.  Your  doctor  may  also  consider 
monitoring the levels of that medicine in your blood.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor  for  advice  before  taking  this  medicine.  The  potential  risk  of  Renvela  during  human  pregnancy  is 
unknown. Talk to your doctor who will decide if you can continue the treatment with Renvela. 
It is unknown whether Renvela is excreted in breast milk and may affect your baby. Talk to your doctor who 
will decide if you can breastfeed your baby or not, and if it is necessary to stop Renvela treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Renvela is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
Excipients

3. 
How to take Renvela 
You  must  take  Renvela  as  prescribed  by  your  doctor.  They  will  base  the  dose  on  your  serum  phosphorus 
level.  
For a 0.8 g dose, the powder for oral suspension should be dispersed in 30 mL of water per sachet. Drink 
within 30 minutes of being prepared. It is important to drink all of the liquid and it may be necessary to rinse 
the glass with water and drink this as well to ensure that all of the powder is swallowed. 
Instead of water, the powder may be pre-mixed with a small amount of cold beverage (about 120 ml or half a 
glass)  or  food  (about  100  grams)  and  consumed  within  30  minutes.  Do  not  heat  Renvela  powder  (e.g. 
microwave) or add to hot foods or liquids. 
The recommended starting dose of this medicine for adults and elderly is 2.4-4.8g per day equally divided 
over three meals. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. The exact starting dose 
and regimen will be determined by your doctor. 
Take Renvela after your meal or with food. 
(Instructions for presentation with dosing spoon) 
For 0.4 g doses, the powder in the sachet may be divided. In this case the 0.4 g dose of Renvela powder must 
be measured using the dosing spoon provided in the carton. 
Always use the dosing spoon provided in the carton. 
(Instructions for presentation WITHOUT dosing spoon) 
If  a  dose  of  0.4  g  is  to  be  administered,  please  use  the  dedicated  0.8  g  powder  presentation  with  dosing 
spoon. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The recommended starting dose of Renvela for children is based on their height and weight (used to 
calculate  body  surface  area  by  your  physician).  For children, the powder is preferred, as tablets are not 
appropriate in this population. This medicine  should  not  be  given  on  an  empty  stomach  and should  be 
taken  with  meals  or  snacks. The exact starting dose and regimen will be determined by your doctor. 
For doses of less than 0.8 g, the powder in the sachet may be divided. The 0.4 g dose of Renvela powder 
must be measured  using  the dosing spoon provided in the carton.  
Preparation using a  dosing spoon 
76

within 30 minutes of being prepared. It is important to drink all of the liquid to ensure that 
all of the powder is swallowed.  
o  Close the sachet by folding over twice. 
o  The remaining powder may be used within 24 hours for the next dose.  
Discard sachets of powder that have been opened for more than 24 hours. 
Initially, your doctor will check the levels of phosphorus in your blood every 2-4 weeks and may adjust the 
dose of Renvela when necessary to reach an adequate phosphate level. 
Follow the diet prescribed by your doctor. 
If you take more Renvela than you should 
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Renvela 
If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the usual time 
with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Renvela 
Taking  your  Renvela  treatment  is  important  to  maintain  an  appropriate  phosphate  level  in  your  blood. 
Stopping Renvela would lead to important consequences such as calcification in the blood vessels.  If you 
consider stopping your Renvela treatment, contact your doctor or pharmacist first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

3. 
How to take Renvela 
You  must  take  Renvela  as  prescribed  by  your  doctor.  They  will  base  the  dose  on  your  serum  phosphorus 
level.  
For a 1.6 g dose, the powder for oral suspension should be dispersed in 40 mL of water per sachet. Drink 
within 30 minutes of being prepared. It is important to drink all of the liquid and it may be necessary to rinse 
the glass with water and drink this as well to ensure that all of the powder is swallowed. 
Instead of water, the powder may be pre-mixed with a small amount of cold beverage (about 120 ml or half a 
glass)  or  food  (about  100  grams)  and  consumed  within  30  minutes.  Do  not  heat  Renvela  powder  (e.g. 
microwave) or add to hot foods or liquids. 
The recommended starting dose of this medicine for adults and elderly is 2.4-4.8g per day equally divided 
over three meals. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. The exact starting dose 
and regimen will be determined by your doctor. 
Take Renvela after your meal or with food. 
If a dose of 0.4 g is to be administered, please use the dedicated 0.8 g powder presentation with dosing 
spoon. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The  recommended  starting  dose  of  Renvela  for  children  is  based  on  their  height  and  weight  (used  to 
calculate  body  surface  area  by  your  physician).  For children, the powder is preferred, as tablets are not 
appropriate in this population.  This medicine  should  not  be  given  on  an  empty  stomach  and should  be 
taken  with  meals  or  snacks. The exact starting dose and regimen will be determined by your doctor. 
Initially, your doctor will check the levels of phosphorus in your blood every 2-4 weeks and may adjust the 
dose of Renvela when necessary to reach an adequate phosphate level. 
Follow the diet prescribed by your doctor. 
If you take more Renvela than you should 
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Renvela 
If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the usual time 
with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you stop taking Renvela 
Taking  your  Renvela  treatment  is  important  to  maintain  an  appropriate  phosphate  level  in  your  blood. 
Stopping Renvela would lead to important consequences such as calcification in the blood vessels.  If you 
consider stopping your Renvela treatment, contact your doctor or pharmacist first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

6. Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Renvela is and what it is used for 
Renvela contains sevelamer carbonate as the active substance. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive 
tract and so reduces serum phosphorus levels in the blood. 
This medicine is used to control hyperphosphataemia (high blood phosphate levels) in: 
• 
adult  patients  on  dialysis  (a  blood  clearance  technique).  It  can  be  used  in  patients  undergoing 
haemodialysis (using a blood filtration machine) or peritoneal dialysis (where fluid is pumped into the 
abdomen and an internal body membrane filters the blood); 
adult  patients  with  chronic  (long-term)  kidney  disease  who  are  not  on  dialysis  and  have  a  serum 
(blood) phosphorus level equal to or above 1.78 mmol/l. 
paediatric  patients  with  chronic  (long-term)  kidney  disease  above  the  age  of  6  and  above  a  certain 
• 
height and weight (used to calculate body surface area by your physician). 
• 
This medicine should be used with other treatments such as calcium supplements and vitamin D to prevent 
the development of bone disease. 
Increased  levels  of  serum  phosphorus  can  lead  to  hard  deposits  in  your  body  called  calcification.  These 
deposits  can  stiffen  your  blood  vessels  and  make  it  harder  for  blood  to  be  pumped  around  the  body. 
Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Renvela 
Do not take Renvela if: 
• 
you  are allergic  to  the  active  substance  or  to  any  of  the  other  ingredients  of  this  medicine  (listed  in 
section 6). 
you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you) 
you have bowel obstruction  
• 
• 
Warnings and Precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Renvela if any of the following applies to you: 
• problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
• being sick frequently 
• active inflammation of the bowel 
88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel 
Talk to your doctor while taking Renvela: 
• 
if  you  experience  severe  abdominal  pain,  stomach  or  intestine  disorders,  or  blood  in  the  stool 
(gastrointestinal  bleeding).  These  symptoms  can  be  due  to  serious  inflammatory  bowel  disease 
caused  by  sevelamer  crystals  deposit  in  your  bowel.  Contact  your  doctor  who  will  decide  on 
continuing the treatment or not. 
Additional treatments 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
•  develop  low  or  high  levels  of  calcium  in  your  blood.  Since  this  medicine  does  not  contain  calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
•  have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of 
vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your 
blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as 
necessary. 
•  have disturbed level of bicarbonate in your blood and increased acidity in the blood and other body 
tissue. Your doctor should monitor the level of bicarbonate in your blood. 
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis. 
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You should tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, 
abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  
Children 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 6 years) have not been studied. Therefore this medicine 
is not recommended for use in children below the age of 6 years. 
Other medicines and Renvela 
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
•  Renvela should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). 
•  If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor 
when taking Renvela. 
•  The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used 
to suppress the immune system) may be reduced by Renvela. Your doctor will advise you if you are 
taking these medicines. 
•  Thyroid hormone deficiency may uncommonly be observed in certain people taking levothyroxine 
(used to treat low thyroid hormone levels) and Renvela. Therefore your doctor may monitor the levels 
of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood more closely.  
• Medicines treating heartburn and reflux from your stomach or oesophagus, such as omeprazole, 
pantoprazole, or lansoprazole, known as “proton pump inhibitors”, may reduce the efficacy of 
Renvela.  Your doctor may monitor the phosphate level in your blood. 
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renvela and other medicines on a regular basis. 
In some cases where Renvela should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may advise 
you  to  take  this  medicine  1 hour  before  or  3 hours  after  Renvela  intake.  Your  doctor  may  also  consider 
monitoring the levels of that medicine in your blood.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor  for  advice  before  taking  this  medicine.  The  potential  risk  of  Renvela  during  human  pregnancy  is 
unknown. Talk to your doctor who will decide if you can continue the treatment with Renvela. 
It is unknown whether Renvela is excreted in breast milk and may affect your baby. Talk to your doctor who 
will decide if you can breastfeed your baby or not, and if it is necessary to stop Renvela treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Renvela is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines.

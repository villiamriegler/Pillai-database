On 25 September 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the 
medicinal product PREZISTA, 75/150/300/600 mg film-coated tablets. The marketing authorisation 
holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International N.V. They may request a re-
examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing 
of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion.

treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body 
weight.” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

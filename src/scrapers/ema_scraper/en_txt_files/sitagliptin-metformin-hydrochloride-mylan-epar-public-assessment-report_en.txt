2.1.  Introduction 
The application for marketing authorisation of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 50 mg/850 mg and 
50 mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets is submitted under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended 
(i.e. a generic MA application). The reference product is Janumet, film-coated tablet, 50 mg/850 mg and 50

mg/1000 mg marketed by Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., that was first approved in the European Union on 
16 July 2008 via the centralised procedure (EU/1/08/455). 
The active substances of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan are sitagliptin and metformin 
hydrochloride, two oral blood glucose-lowering drugs used in combination in the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of 
blood glucose, which prevalence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is 
due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin insensitivity 
as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual pancreatic beta-cell failure. In type 
2 diabetes mellitus, the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. Over time, high 
blood sugar levels can increase the risk for serious complications, including serious damage to the heart, 
blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves.  
Sitagliptin is an active, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4 inhibitor) 
that has been approved for the therapy of type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin 100 mg daily was well tolerated and 
provided effective and sustained improvement in HbA1c, FPG and PPG levels. Sitagliptin prolongs the activity 
of proteins that increase the release of insulin after blood sugar rises, such as after a meal. Sitagliptin 
metabolizes the naturally occurring incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) resulting in enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion from 
the pancreas and decreased hepatic glucose production.  
Metformin is the most commonly prescribed therapy for patients with T2DM. It has a good safety profile and 
is associated with low cost. Metformin is high efficiency in reducing fasting and postprandial blood glucose 
and lowering glycosylated hemoglobin in patients. The hypoglycemic effect of metformin is closely related to 
its capabilities in suppression of hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and promotion 
of β-cell functions and insulin sensitivity. Metformin increases insulin release and cell viability at the presence 
of glucose or free fatty acids. In addition, it also decreases lipogenesis in the liver, muscles, and fat, inhibits 
lipolysis in fat and increases glucose utilization and GLP-1 secretion.  
The indications applied for Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan are the same as those for the reference 
product Janumet:  
For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin 
alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.  
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple 
combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their 
maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan is indicated as triple combination therapy with a 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of 
metformin and a PPARγ agonist.  
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple 
combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients 
when stable dose of insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

of sitagliptin free base and 1000 mg of metformin hydrochloride. 
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous colloidal silica, croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl 
sulphate, povidone and sodium stearyl fumarate; 
Film-coating: polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol, talc, titanium dioxide (E171), red iron oxide (E172), yellow iron 
oxide (E172) (50/850 only) and black iron oxide (E172) (50/1000 only).     
The product is available in PVC/PE/PVDC/Alu blisters and HDPE bottles with white opaque polypropylene 
screw cap with aluminium induction sealing liner wad as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance – Sitagliptin Monohydrate 
General information 
The documentation on the active substance is presented using an active substance master file (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The chemical name of sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is 7-((3R)-3-amino-1-oxo-4-(2, 4, 5-
trifluorophenyl) butyl]-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-3-(trifluoro methyl)-1, 2, 4-triazolo (4, 3-a] pyrazine 
hydrochloride monohydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C16H15F6N5O.HCl.H2O It has a molecular 
mass of 461.79 g/mol (salt/hydrate form) or 407.32 (free base) and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/27581/2022 
Page 12/37 
 
 
 
 
The chemical structure of sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate was confirmed by a combination of UV 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The presence of the 
hydrated form was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was used to 
characterise the crystalline form. 
Sitagliptin  hydrochloride  monohydrate  is  a  white  to  off-white  slightly  hygroscopic  crystalline  powder,  freely 
soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. It contains a single chiral centre which is introduced 
selectively in the synthetic process. Enantiopurity is determined by a chiral HPLC method in the active substance 
specification.  
Polymorphism was investigated extensively, and many different hydrated and solvated forms were identified. 
The commercial crystallisation conditions for isolation of the active substance ensure that the monohydrate is 
formed routinely. It was also demonstrated in stability studies that this form is stable during storage.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is synthesized convergently in 6 main stages using two well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The crystallisation conditions in 
the last stage ensure the correct solvate and polymorphic form is produced routinely. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. The assessment and control of potentially mutagenic impurities was not adequately 
documented in the initial submission. In addition, the risk of mutagenic impurities from the starting materials 
had not been explained, resulting in a major objection. In response, the applicant provided a clear 
explanation of the hazard assessments conducted, as well as the risk assessment of the starting materials. 
The control strategy was further justified. The revised risk assessment and control strategy for mutagenic 
impurities is in line with ICH M7. 
The active substance is packaged in a single polyethylene (PE) bag, twisted and tied with a plastic fastener. 
The PE bag is inserted in a triple laminated aluminium bag and sealed. These bags are further packed in 
HDPE drums. The primary contact material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification shown in Table 1 includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), 
identity (IR, HPLC), identity of chloride (Ph. Eur.), polymorphic form (XRPD), water content (KF), sulphated 
ash (Ph. Eur.), hydrochloride content (potentiometry), enantiomer content (chiral HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
Limits for impurities have been set in line with ICH Q3A. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. No 
test for microbiological quality is needed as batch data demonstrates that levels are routinely below 
pharmacopoeial limits for non-sterile active substances. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data from 3 production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Samples were tested for appearance, identification by XRPD, water content, content of (S)-isomer, 
related substances, assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability 
indicating. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed and all remained within 
specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The active substance is 
photostable. 
The active substance was also exposed to stressed conditions. In aqueous acid or base, degradation occurs. 
However, sitagliptin is stable to heat and oxidation. In the solid state, the active substance is stable with 
respect to heat and humidity.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed container at or 
below 25°C. 
2.2.3.  Active substance – Metformin Hydrochloride 
General information 
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride is 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride corresponding to the

polyethylene bags, placed in either cardboard box or fiber drum or polyethylene drum. 
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate and 
metformin hydrochloride as active substances in a fixed dose combination. Two strengths are proposed to be 
authorised:  
•  50 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets are pink, capsule shaped, biconvex, bevelled edge tablet, 
debossed with ‘M’ on one side of the tablet and ‘SM5’ on the other side.  
•  50 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets are peach to brown, capsule shaped, biconvex, bevelled edge 
tablet, debossed with ‘M’ on one side of the tablet and ‘SM7’ on the other side.  
The two strengths can be sufficiently differentiated by colour and debossing. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic product that is essentially similar and 
bioequivalent to the reference product, Janumet. The generic product was developed containing the same 
two strengths as the reference product. Metformin hydrochloride is used in both products. However, in the 
generic product, sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is used instead of sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate 
used in the reference product which is acceptable according to Directive 2001/83/EC. Different salts of an 
Assessment report

active substance are considered to be the same active substance, if they not differ significantly in properties 
with regard to safety and efficacy (see section 2.4.1 for clinical justification). The majority of the excipients 
are the same in both products. However, the generic product additionally includes croscarmellose sodium and 
colloidal silica in the core tablet and iron oxide yellow is used in the film-coating of 50 mg/850 mg strength 
instead of iron oxide black. Compatibility of each excipient with both active substances was demonstrated. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
Physicochemical properties of both active substances have been sufficiently discussed in the dossier with 
respect to particle size distribution, bulk and tapped density, compressibility index and Hausner ratio and 
solubility. Both active substances are freely soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range and 
both exhibit polymorphism. Stability of polymorphic form during manufacturing and storage of finished 
product was demonstrated for both active substances.  
A quality target product profile (QTPP) was established for the generic product focussing on essential 
similarity with the reference product and pharmacopoeial requirements. Based on risk assessments, the 
attributes of the finished product most likely to be impacted by formulation development were identified as 
content uniformity, impurities and dissolution. These were defined as the critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Both active substances exhibit poor flow properties. Several prototype formulations were developed to 
investigate the impact of different excipient contents and process parameters on the identified CQAs. 
Metformin hydrochloride is the main constituent of the tablets. The selection of the manufacturing process is 
described adequately. The process parameters of the intermediate stages were optimised to ensure the CQAs 
are achieved. The developed process has been shown to be suitable to handle the active substance properties 
and produce tablets of acceptable content uniformity. Impurity content of the generic and reference products 
were shown to be sufficiently similar. 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated in clinical studies under both fed and fasted conditions. In addition, 
comparative in vitro dissolution studies in 3 dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) were performed between 
test and reference products. Less than 85% of the active substances had been released after 15 minutes and 
so f2 values were calculated to demonstrate similarity of dissolution profiles in line with the requirements of 
the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). The f2 values were found to 
be greater than 50 in all the media studied. Therefore dissolution profiles can be considered similar. 
Since both active substances are freely soluble, the dissolution method was developed considering the 
expected in vivo release characteristics. A suitable medium with the paddle appararus was selected, and the 
volume and paddle speed were justified. Discriminatory power was investigated with respect to meaningful 
changes in relevant process parameters. In each case, a 20-25% change in dissolution time was observed. 
Given the inherent high solubility of the active substances, the QC dissolution method and discriminatory 
power were considered adequate once the release specification has been tightened at the request of CHMP. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVDC-Alu blisters or HDPE bottles with white opaque polypropylene screw 
caps with aluminium induction sealing liner wads. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process involves wet granulation of metformin with intra-granular excipients followed by 
drying and milling; blending with sitagliptin and extra-granular excipients; compression; tabletting; 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated for 3 batches of each strength at the minimum 
scale defined in the dossier. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Critical steps of the process 
were identified and justified. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form. An acceptable validation scheme has been included in module 3.2.R which documents 
steps that will be taken to validate the process on the maximum scale defined in the dossier. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications for the 50/850 mg tablets shown in Table 6 include appropriate 
tests for this kind of dosage form including description, dimensions, identification (HPLC, UV), dissolution 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (KF), 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), presence of TiO2 and iron oxide (colour tests) and N-nitrosodimethylamine 
(NDMA, GC-MS/MS). The specifications for the 50/1000 mg tablet are the same except for the description, 
dimension, and absolute mass listed in the assay calculation. 
Related substances are limited in line with ICH Q3B. Limits for total impurities, dissolution and water content 
were tightened at the request of CHMP. The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product 
was assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
Batch analysis data from multiple batches of each strength using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, 
demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. 
Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to 
include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). The finished product contains metformin which contains 
dimethyamine as an impurity and is known to be susceptible to formation of NDMA during formulation. The 
applicant initially claimed that there was no risk of NDMA formation and provided data from multiple batches 
of finished product where NDMA was not detected. However, the analytical method was not considered 
sensitive enough and there was no discussion of an actual control strategy for prevention of NDMA formation. 
In line with what is currently requested of all MAHs for metformin-containing products, a major objection was 
raised asking for routine control of NDMA. In response, the applicant introduced a routine test for NDMA in 
the finished product specification and explained that the blister packaging used will not contain nitrocellulose. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 batches of finished product each strength stored for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in both of the primary packaging proposed for marketing. For the HDPE bottles, a 
bracketing approach was taken given that the bottles contain 30, 90 or 196 tablets. Only the extreme counts 
were tested which was considered justified in line with ICH Q1D. Samples were tested for description, assay, 
dissolution, related substances, water content and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are 
the same as for release testing and are stability indicating. No significant trends were observed for any of the 
measured parameters which all remained within specification. For the later timepoints, dissolution results met 
with the limit that was tightened during the procedure. In addition, NDMA was not detected at the later 
timepoints. 
In addition, 1 batch of each strength stored in each packaging format (including the extremes of the bottle 
count) were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. The finished product was found to be photostable irrespective of packaging format 
or strength. 
An open pot study for up to 90 days was conducted in lieu of an in-use study. All tested parameters remained 
within specification. However, it was not possible to test for NDMA since all samples had been discarded 
before the specification limit was added. Therefore, the CHMP asked the applicant to start a new open pot 
study and the applicant committed to informing the agency should any out of specification results be 
obtained (REC). However, given the provided data from long term and accelerated studies, it is not expected 
that NDMA will be formed to any appreciable amount. 
A bulk stability study was conducted on 3 batches of each strength, stored for up to 6 months under long 
term and accelerated conditions. No significant changes were observed to any of the measured parameters 
and a bulk holding time of 12 months without temperature restriction is justified. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without specific storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, the applicant provided a revised risk assessment 
and hazard assessment for potential mutagenic impurities in sitagliptin in order to address a major objection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/27581/2022

The second major objection relating to the potential presence of NDMA in the finished product was resolved 
by addition of a specification limit in line with the acceptable intake. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to measuring NDMA content in the finished product at the 
end of a second open pot study. This point is put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.7.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant is recommended to conduct a further open pot study on the finished product and 
measure the NDMA content at the end of the study and inform the agency should any out of 
specification results be obtained. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are 
required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride are two different types of antihyperglycaemic agents with 
complementary mechanisms of actions for lowering blood glucose.  
Sitagliptin is a competitive inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4), an enzyme that degrades incretin 
peptides glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent-insulinotropic peptide (GIP). 
Pharmacologically, sitagliptin has a very high selectivity for DPP-4 with concentrations of 50% inhibition 
(IC50) in the range of 13-69 Nm in rodents, dogs and humans, but with a minimal inhibition against closely 
related proteases including DPP-8/9 and a panel of unrelated enzymes and ion channels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/27581/2022 
Page 19/37 
 
 
 
Metformin is a biguanide that has been used for glycaemic control in T2DM patients since 1959 in the 
European market. Current literature suggest that metformin exerts its BG lowering effect through 
complicated mechanisms which involve reduction in hepatic glucose production through inhibition of 
gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, improvement of insulin sensitivity via potentiation of peripheral glucose 
uptake and utilization and inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  hydrochloride  is  well  known.  New  non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic  studies  have  not  been  conducted  and  it  is  considered  acceptable  for  generic  application. 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  conducted  with  sitagliptin/metformin  fixed-dose  combination  products  were  not 
identified in the literature, however, there were no pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction between the two 
components. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics studies for sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride have been 
separated. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Published  toxicity  data,  including  single  dose  toxicity,  repeat-dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity, 
reproductive and development toxicity were provided. No new specific data submitted. 
Non-clinical aspects of the Section 4.6 and 5.3 of the proposed SmPC are in line with the reference product 
and published scientific literature and considered acceptable. 
No preclinical studies have been conducted with the sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride fixed-dose combination 
to  evaluate  the  acute  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  and  reproductive  and  development  toxicity.  The 
bridging toxicological data demonstrating a lack of exacerbated toxicity when sitagliptin was co-administrated 
with  metformin  hydrochloride  in  dogs  (the  most  sensitive  toxicological  species)  are  considered  sufficient  to 
support the safety of the sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride fixed-dose combination products. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  including  PECsurfacewater  calculation  and  information  about  logKow  is 
submitted. The PEC values for both metformin hydrochloride and sitagliptin are above the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L, therefore, Phase II studies are necessary. The PNECsurfacewater for metformin has calculated by applying 
an assessment factor of 10 to the lowest NOEC from multiple chronic studies with algae, daphnids and fish. 
The PNECsurfacewater for sitagliptin has calculated by applying an assessment factor of 10 to the lowest NOEC 
from a study with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (green algae). The PECsurfacewater to PNECsurfacewater 
ratio (risk quotient) for both metformin hydrochloride and sitagliptin is below 1, and it can be concluded that 
the active substances are unlikely to represented risk for aquatic environment. 
The logKow values for both metformin hydrochloride and sitagliptin are below the action limit 4.5, no further 
PBT (Persistence, Bioaccumulation, Toxicity) assessment is deemed necessary. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The range of non-clinical data presented in the dossier is appropriate for a generic application. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. ERA is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/27581/2022

The CHMP considers that the non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. It 
is agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan was 
provided and was accepted by the CHMP. Additional non-clinical studies were not considered necessary. The 
product is considered approvable from a non-clinical viewpoint. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. To support 
the application, the Applicant has submitted four bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence studies have been 
performed with both strengths and under both fasted and fed conditions. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 in its current version is of 
particular relevance.  
Human pharmacology, efficacy and safety of metformin and sitagliptin are well known. The updated clinical 
overview on human pharmacology, efficacy and safety of metformin and sitagliptin is considered appropriate.  
In the clinical overview the Applicant has provided a justification for the use of an alternative salt 
(hydrochloride monohydrate) for sitagliptin, as a phosphate salt is used for sitagliptin in the reference 
product. The Applicant states that there are no pharmacological or toxicological objections against the use of 
this salt in the proposed indications compared to the phosphate salt and that the different salt of the active 
substance sitagliptin does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy. The 
hydrochloride salt also does not differ significantly in physico-chemical properties from the phosphate salt 
and both salts are highly soluble. The provided justification is considered acceptable. 
The clinical aspects of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are in line with the SmPC of the 
reference products with amendments presented in the annexed product information. 
GCP aspect 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the application, the Applicant has submitted four bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence studies 
have been performed with both strengths because the active substances quantitatively proportional 
composition of the different strengths is not the same. According to the information in the SmPC 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan should be given with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions associated with metformin. Therefore, bioequivalence studies have been performed under both 
fasted and fed conditions. 
Bioequivalence studies undertaken: 
1. Study No. C18136: A randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, 
crossover, oral bioequivalence study to compare Sitagliptin/Metformin Hydrochloride film - coated tablets

Statistical methods 
For pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis actual time of blood sample collection was used for estimation of 
pharmacokinetic  parameters,  which  was  computed  using  non-compartmental  model  of  Phoenix  WinNonlin 
version 8.0.for Sitagliptin and Metformin. 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin and Metformin were subjected 
to  Analysis  of  Variance  (ANOVA).  ANOVA  model  included  terms  for  Sequence,  Formulation  and  Period  and 
Subject (Sequence) as fixed effects. The sequence effect was tested using the Subject (Sequence) effect as an 
error term. 
Two one-sided test for bioequivalence and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of least squares mean between 
drug formulations were calculated, for ln-transformed data of Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin and Metformin.  
The power of a test to detect 20% difference between test and reference products were computed and reported 
for Sitagliptin and Metformin.  
Ratio of least squares means of test and reference products were computed for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin and Metformin.  
Ratio analysis was reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin and 
Metformin.  
Intra-Subject  variability  was  computed  for  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  of 
Sitagliptin and Metformin.  
Determination of sample size 
The  maximum  observed  intra-subject  variability  for  Sitagliptin  among  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters 
(Cmax) was found to be 16%. Hence, considering the CV of 16% the following estimates were considered for 
the computation of sample size: 
T/R ratio (expected between) = 90-111.1% 
Intra-Subject C.V (%) = 16% 
Significance Level = 5% 
Power = >90% 
Bioequivalence Limit=80-125.00% 
Based on the above estimate, a sample size of 34 subjects were sufficient to establish bioequivalence between 
formulations  with  adequate  power.  However,  considering  the  dropouts,  a  sample  size  of  36  subjects  were 
considered for the study.

Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence are as follows: 
Bioequivalence  of  the  test  product  (A)  with  that  of  the  reference  product  (B)  under  fasting  conditions  were 
concluded  if  the  90%  confidence  intervals  of  geometric  least  square  mean  ratio  of  the  test  and  reference 
product falls within the acceptable range of 80.00 % – 125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
of Cmax and AUC0-t for Sitagliptin and Metformin.

Statistical methods 
For pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis actual time of blood sample collection was used for estimation of 
pharmacokinetic parameters, which was computed using non-compartmental model of Phoenix WinNonlin 
version 8.0.for Sitagliptin and Metformin. 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin and Metformin were subjected 
to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA model included terms for Sequence, Formulation and Period and 
Subject (Sequence) as fixed effects. The sequence effect was tested using the Subject (Sequence) effect as 
an error term. 
Two one-sided test for bioequivalence and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of least squares mean 
between drug formulations were calculated, for ln-transformed data of Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin and 
Metformin.  
The power of a test to detect 20% difference between test and reference products were computed and 
reported for Sitagliptin and Metformin.  
Ratio of least squares means of test and reference products were computed for ln-transformed

Intra-Subject variability was computed for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of 
Sitagliptin and Metformin.  
Determination of sample size 
The maximum observed intra-subject variability for Sitagliptin among primary pharmacokinetic parameters 
(Cmax) was found to be 16%. Hence, considering the CV of 16% the following estimates were considered for 
the computation of sample size: 
T/R ratio (expected between) = 90-111.1% 
Intra-Subject C.V (%) = 16% 
Significance Level = 5% 
Power = >90% 
Bioequivalence Limit=80-125.00% 
Based on the above estimate, a sample size of 34 subjects were sufficient to establish bioequivalence 
between formulations with adequate power. However, considering the dropouts, a sample size of 36 subjects 
were considered for the study. 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence are as follows: 
Bioequivalence of the test product (A) with that of the reference product (B) under fed conditions were 
concluded if the 90% confidence intervals of geometric least square mean ratio of the test and reference 
product falls within the acceptable range of 80.00 % – 125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters of Cmax and AUC0-t for Sitagliptin and Metformin.

Pharmacokinetic conclusion 
Based on the presented four bioequivalence studies (No.C18136, No.C18137, No.SIME-1-19123 and 
No.SIME-1-19124) Sitagliptin/Metformin Hydrochloride film-coated tablets 50 mg/1000 mg and 50mg/850mg 
(Manufactured by Mylan Laboratories Limited, India) are considered bioequivalent with JANUMET 
(Sitagliptin/Metformin Hydrochloride) film-coated tablets 50 mg/1000mg and 50mg/850mg of Merck Sharp & 
Dohme. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.2.3.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Metformin and Sitagliptin are widely used and well-known active substances. The safety profile and 
tolerability of Metformin and Sitagliptin are well established.  
A justification on the use of an alternative salt (hydrochloride monohydrate) is provided. The Applicant states 
that there are no pharmacological or toxicological objections against the use of this salt in the proposed 
indications compared to the phosphate salt and that the different salt of the active substance sitagliptin does 
not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy. The hydrochloride salt also does not 
differ significantly in physico-chemical properties from the phosphate salt and both salts are highly soluble. 
The provided justification is considered acceptable. 
To support this application, the company has submitted four bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence studies 
have been performed with both strengths because the active substances quantitatively proportional 
Assessment report  
EMA/27581/2022 
Page 32/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
composition of the different strengths is not the same. According to the information in the SmPC 
Sitagliptin/Metformin should be given with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated 
with metformin. Therefore, bioequivalence studies have been performed under both fasted and fed 
conditions.  
The study designs were considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of these formulations and were 
in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as 
well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied were adequate. The test formulations of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 850 
mg/50 mg film-coated tablets and Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 1000 mg/50 mg film-coated 
tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the reference products 
JANUMET 50mg/850mg sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride and JANUMET 50mg/1000mg 
sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride.  The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the 
parameters AUC0-t and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 
80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the four formulations was demonstrated. 
Overall, the drug products tested were generally safe and well tolerated by the subjects included in this 
study. No unexpected safety signals have been reported from the submitted studies. In the bioequivalence 
studies presented by the applicant all reported adverse events were mild in severity.  
The clinical aspects of the Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the four bioequivalence studies provided (No.C18136, No.C18137, No.SIME-1-19123 and No.SIME-
1-19124) Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan film-coated tablets 50mg/1000 mg and 50mg/850mg are 
considered bioequivalent with JANUMET (sitagliptin/metformin Hydrochloride) film-coated tablets 
50mg/1000mg and 50mg/850mg. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded from a clinical viewpoint.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application for marketing authorisation of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 50 mg/850 mg and 
50 mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets. The reference product is Janumet, film-coated tablet, 50 mg/850 mg 
and 50 mg/1000 mg marketed by Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., that was first approved in the European 
Union on 16 July 2008 via the centralised procedure. 
The indications applied for Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan are the same as those for the reference 
product Janumet:

For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin 
alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.  
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple 
combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their 
maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride is indicated as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet 
and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a 
PPARγ agonist.  
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination 
therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose 
of insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substances were presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substances; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
To support the application, the Applicant has submitted four bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence studies 
have been performed with both strengths because the active substances quantitatively proportional 
composition of the different strengths is not the same. According to the information in the SmPC 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan should be given with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions associated with metformin. Therefore, bioequivalence studies have been performed under both 
fasted and fed conditions. 
The studies designs were considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of these formulations and were 
in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as 
well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied were adequate. The test formulations of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 850 
mg/50 mg film-coated tablets and Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 1000 mg/50 mg film-coated 
tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the reference products 
JANUMET 50mg/850mg sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride and JANUMET 50mg/1000mg 
sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride.  The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the 
parameters AUC0-t and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 
80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the four formulations was demonstrated.  
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. RMP version 0.2 is agreed. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can be concluded.

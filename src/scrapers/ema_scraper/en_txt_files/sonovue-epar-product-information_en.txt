CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
SonoVue is for use with ultrasound imaging to enhance the echogenicity of the blood, or of fluids in 
the urinary tract which results in an improved signal to noise ratio. 
SonoVue should only be used in patients where study without contrast enhancement is inconclusive. 
Echocardiography 
SonoVue is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in adult patients with suspected 
or established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and enhance left 
ventricular endocardial border delineation. 
Doppler of macrovasculature 
SonoVue increases the accuracy in detection or exclusion of abnormalities in cerebral arteries and 
extracranial carotid or peripheral arteries in adult patients by improving the Doppler signal to noise 
ratio. 
SonoVue increases the quality of the Doppler flow image and the duration of clinically-useful signal 
enhancement in portal vein assessment in adult patients. 
Doppler of microvasculature 
SonoVue improves display of the vascularity of liver and breast lesions during Doppler sonography in 
adult patients leading to more specific lesion characterisation. 
Ultrasonography of excretory urinary tract 
SonoVue is indicated for use in ultrasonography of the excretory tract in paediatric patients from 
newborn to 18 years to detect vesicoureteral reflux. For the limitation in the interpretation of a 
negative urosonography, see section 4.4. and 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This product should only be used by physicians experienced in diagnostic ultrasound imaging. 
Emergency equipment and personnel trained in its use must be readily available.

Posology 
Intravenous use  
The recommended doses of SonoVue in adults are: 
• 
• 
During a single examination, a second injection of the recommended dose can be made when deemed 
necessary by the physician.  
B-mode imaging of cardiac chambers, at rest or with stress: 2 mL. 
Vascular Doppler imaging: 2.4 mL. 
Elderly Patients 
The dose recommendations for intravenous administration also apply to elderly patients. 
Paediatric Patients 
The safety and efficacy of SonoVue in patients under 18 years of age has not been established for 
intravenous administration and use in echocardiography and vascular Doppler imaging.  
Intravesical use  
• 
In paediatric patients the recommended dose of SonoVue is 1 mL 
Method of administration  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6. 
Intravenous use   
SonoVue should be administered immediately after drawing into the syringe by injection into a 
peripheral vein. Every injection should be followed by a flush with 5 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection. 
Intravesical use  
After introduction of a sterile 6F-8F urinary catheter into the bladder under sterile conditions, the 
bladder is emptied of urine and then filled with saline (normal sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution) 
to approximately one third or half of its predicted total volume [(age in years + 2) x 30] mL. SonoVue 
is then administered through the urinary catheter. Administration of SonoVue is followed by 
completion of bladder filling with saline until patient has the urge to micturate or there is the first 
slight sign of back pressure to the infusion. Ultrasound imaging of the bladder and kidneys is 
performed during filling and voiding of the bladder. Immediately following the first voiding, the 
bladder may be refilled with saline for a second cycle of voiding and imaging, without the need of a 
second SonoVue administration. A low mechanical index (≤ 0.4) is recommended for imaging the 
bladder, ureters, and kidney during ultrasonography of the urinary tract with contrast. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Intravenous use of SonoVue is contraindicated in patients known to have right-to-left shunts, severe 
pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure >90 mmHg), uncontrolled systemic hypertension, 
and in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. 
SonoVue must not be used in combination with dobutamine in patients with conditions suggesting 
cardiovascular instability where dobutamine is contraindicated. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  have  been  observed  during  or  shortly  following  SonoVue 
administration  in  patients  with  no  prior  exposure  to  sulphur  hexafluoride  microbubbles  products, 
including  patients  with  prior  hypersensitivity  reaction(s)  to  macrogol,  also  known  as  polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) (see section 4.8). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SonoVue contains PEG (see section 6.1). There may be increased risk of serious reactions in patients 
with prior hypersensitivity reaction(s) to PEG.  
It  is  recommended  to  keep  all  patients  under  close  medical  supervision  during  and  for  at  least  30 
minutes  following  the  administration  of  SonoVue  to  monitor  the  risk  of  serious  hypersensitivity 
reactions (see section 4.2). 
Use caution when treating anaphylaxis with epinephrine in patients on beta blockers since response 
may be poor or promote undesired alpha-adrenergic and vagotonic effects (hypertension, bradycardia). 
Intravenous use 
Patients with unstable cardiopulmonary status 
ECG monitoring should be performed in high-risk patients as clinically indicated and a close medical 
supervision is recommended.  
Use extreme caution when considering the administration of Sonvue in patients with recent acute 
coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease, including: evolving or ongoing 
myocardial infarction, typical angina at rest within last 7 days, significant worsening of cardiac 
symptoms within last 7 days, recent coronary artery intervention or other factors suggesting clinical 
instability (for example, recent deterioration of ECG, laboratory or clinical findings), acute cardiac 
failure, Class III/IV cardiac failure, or severe rhythm disorders because in these patients allergy like 
and/or vasodilatory reactions may lead to life threatening conditions. SonoVue should only be 
administered to such patients after careful risk/benefit assessment and a closely monitoring of vital 
signs should be performed during and after administration. 
It should be emphasised that stress echocardiography not only can induce an ischaemic episode but 
also the stressors may induce predictable, dose-dependent effects on the cardiovascular system (e.g., 
increase in heart rate, blood pressure and ventricular ectopic activity for dobutamine, or decrease in 
blood pressure for adenosine and dipyridamole) as well as unpredictable, hypersensitivity reactions. 
Therefore, if SonoVue is to be used in conjunction with stress echocardiography patients must have a 
stable condition verified by absence of chest pain or ECG modification during the two preceding days. 
Moreover, ECG and blood pressure monitoring should be performed during SonoVue-enhanced 
echocardiography with a pharmacological stress (e.g. with dobutamine).  
Other concomitant diseases 
Caution is advisable when administering the product to patients with: acute endocarditis, prosthetic 
valves, acute systemic inflammation and/or sepsis, hyperactive coagulation states and/or recent 
thromboembolism, and end-stage renal or hepatic disease, as the numbers of patients with those 
conditions who were exposed to SonoVue in the clinical trials were limited. 
Interpretation of voiding urosonography with SonoVue and limitations of use 
False  negative  cases  can  occur  with  voiding  ultrasonography  with  SonoVue  and  have  not  been 
clarified (see section 5.1). 
Technical recommendation  
In animal studies, the application of echo-contrast agents revealed biological adverse reactions (e.g. 
endothelial cell injury, capillary rupture) by interaction with the ultrasound beam. Although these 
biological side effects have not been reported in humans, the use of a low mechanical index is 
recommended. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.

4.6  Pregnancy, lactation, and fertility 
Pregnancy 
No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects 
with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
section 5.3 Preclinical safety data). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
SonoVue during pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding 
It is not known if sulphur hexafluoride is excreted in human milk. However, based on its rapid 
elimination from the body via the expired air, it is considered that the breastfeeding can be resumed 
two to three hours after administration of SonoVue. 
Fertility 
No clinical data are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
SonoVue has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Adult population-Intravenous use 
The safety of SonoVue after intravenous administration was evaluated in 4653 adult patients who 
participated in 58 clinical trials. The undesirable effects reported with SonoVue after intravenous 
administration were, in general, non-serious, transient and resolved spontaneously without residual 
effects. In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions after intravenous 
administration are: headache, injection site reaction, and nausea.

** In some of the cases of hypersensitivity, in patients with underlying coronary artery disease, 
myocardial ischemia and/or myocardial infarctions were also reported. 
***Allergic acute coronary syndrome 
In very rare cases, fatal outcomes have been reported in temporal association with the use of SonoVue. 
In all these patients there was a high underlying risk for major cardiac complications, which could 
have led to the fatal outcome. 
Paediatric population-Intravesical use 
The safety of SonoVue after intravesical administration was based on evaluation of published 
literature involving use of SonoVue in over 6000 paediatric patients (age range 2 days to 18 years). No 
adverse reactions were reported. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Since there have been no cases of overdose reported to date, neither signs nor symptoms of overdose 
have been identified. In a Phase I study doses up to 52 mL of SonoVue were administered to normal 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
volunteers without serious adverse events being reported. In the event of overdose occurring, the 
patient should be observed and treated symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ultrasound contrast media 
ATC code: VO8DA05.  
Sulphur hexafluoride is an inert, innocuous gas, poorly soluble in aqueous solutions. There are 
literature reports of the use of the gas in the study of respiratory physiology and in pneumatic 
retinopexy. The addition of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to the lyophilised 
powder followed by vigorous shaking results in the production of the microbubbles of sulphur 
hexafluoride. The microbubbles have a mean diameter of about 2.5 µm, with 90% having a diameter 
less than 6 µm and 99% having a diameter less than 11 µm. Each millilitre of SonoVue contains 8 µL 
of the microbubbles.  The intensity of the reflected signal is dependent on concentration of the 
microbubbles and frequency of the ultrasound beam. The interface between the sulphur hexafluoride 
bubble and the aqueous medium acts as a reflector of the ultrasound beam thus enhancing blood 
echogenicity and increasing contrast between the blood and the surrounding tissues. 
Intravenous use 
At  the  proposed  clinical  doses  for  intravenous  administration,  SonoVue  has  been  shown  to  provide 
marked increase in signal intensity of more than 2 minutes for B-mode imaging in echocardiography 
and of 3 to 8 minutes for Doppler imaging of the macrovasculature and microvasculature.  
Intravesical use 
For ultrasonography of the excretory urinary tract in paediatric patients, after intravesical 
administration, SonoVue increases the signal intensity of fluids within the urethra, bladder, ureters, 
and renal pelvis, and facilitates the detection of reflux of fluid from the bladder into the ureters. 
The efficacy of SonoVue for detection/exclusion of vesicoureteral reflux was studied in two published 
open  label  single  centre  studies.  The  presence  or  absence  of  vesicoureteral  reflux  with  SonoVue 
ultrasound was compared to the radiographic reference standard. In one study including 183 patients 
(366 kidney-ureter units), SonoVue ultrasound was correctly positive in 89 out 103 units with reflux 
and  correctly  negative  in  226  out  of  263  units  without  reflux.  In  the  second  study  including  228 
patients  (463  kidney-ureter  units),  SonoVue  ultrasound  was  correctly  positive  in  57  out  of  71  units 
with reflux and correctly negative in 302 out of 392 units without reflux. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The total amount of sulphur hexafluoride administered in a clinical dose is extremely small, (in a 2 mL 
dose the microbubbles contain 16 µl of gas). The sulphur hexafluoride dissolves in the blood and is 
subsequently exhaled. 
After a single intravenous injection of 0.03 or 0.3 mL of SonoVue/kg (approximately 1 and 10 times 
the maximum clinical dose) to human volunteers, the sulphur hexafluoride was cleared rapidly. The 
mean terminal half-life was 12 minutes (range 2 to 33 minutes). More than 80% of the administered 
sulphur hexafluoride was recovered in exhaled air within 2 minutes after injection and almost 100% 
after 15 minutes.  
In patients with diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, the percent of dose recovered in expired air 
averaged 100% and the terminal half-life was similar to that measured in healthy volunteers. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction. Caecal lesions observed in some repeat-dose 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies with rats, but not in monkeys, are not relevant for humans under normal conditions of 
administration.  
Intravesical local tolerance for SonoVue was also assessed. A single-dose study and a repeat-dose 
study, both followed by a treatment-free period, were performed in female rats with local toxicity 
evaluated through macroscopic and histopathological examination of both kidneys, ureters, the urinary 
bladder and urethra. It did not reveal any test item-related lesions in any of the examined organs, in 
particular in the urinary bladder, in both the single-dose and the repeat-dose studies. It was therefore 
concluded that SonoVue is well tolerated in the urinary tract in the rat.

3. 
How SonoVue is given 
SonoVue is given to you by medical or healthcare professionals who are experienced in this type of 
examination.  
For ultrasound scan of heart or your blood vessels and/or tissues of the liver and breast in adults, the 
dose to be administered into a vein will be calculated for you depending on which part of your body is 
being examined. The recommended dose is 2 or 2.4 mL per patient. This dose might be repeated if 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needed up to 4.8 mL. 
For ultrasound scan of urinary tract in children the recommended dose is 1 mL per patient to be 
administered into the bladder as follows:  
After  emptying  the  bladder,  a  saline  solution  will  be  introduced  into  the  bladder  via  a  thin  tube. 
SonoVue  will then  be  administered through the thin tube  and  will  be  followed by  administration  of 
saline to continue filling the bladder. The filling and emptying of the bladder with saline solution may 
be repeated if needed.  
If you have a serious pulmonary or cardiac condition, you will be under close medical supervision 
during and for at least 30 minutes after the injection of SonoVue. 
If you are given more SonoVue than you should  
Overdose is not likely to happen since SonoVue is given by a doctor. In the case of overdose, the 
doctor will take appropriate action.

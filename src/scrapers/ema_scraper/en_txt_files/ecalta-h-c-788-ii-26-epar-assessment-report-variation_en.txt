Following the CHMP assessment of efficacy and safety data of Ecalta in neutropenic patients with 
invasive candidiasis and non-neutropenic patients with Candida spp. deep tissue infection (MEA 
014.3), the MAH applied for a an extension of indication with update of sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC . The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition the MAH has taken the opportunity of this variation to bring the Product Information in 
line with the latest QRD template (version 9). 
The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, labelling 
and Package Leaflet.

Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/297/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/297/2011 is not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ecalta contains anidulafungin as active substance. Anidulafungin, a semi-synthetic lipopeptide of the 
echinocandin class, is a non-competitive inhibitor of 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase. The latter enzyme is 
required by many pathogenic fungi for synthesis of β-linked glucan, a component of the cell wall.  
Suppression of glucan production results in osmotically fragile cells that are easily lysed. Anidulafungin 
shows activity in vitro against a number of important pathogenic organisms, including Candida and 
Aspergillus species. 
The currently approved therapeutic indication for Ecalta is: 
Treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult non-neutropenic patients.   
Ecalta has been studied primarily in patients with candidaemia and only in a limited number of patients 
with deep tissue Cancida infections or with abscess-forming disease (see section 4.4 and 5.1). 
The recommended dose of Ecalta is a single 200 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 100 mg daily 
thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based on the patient’s clinical response. In general, 
antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. 
In September 2013, following the submission of data in neutropenic subjects and in subjects with deep 
tissue candidiasis (MEA 014.3. see attachment 13), the CHMP concluded that  
Page 4/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  At that time, the data presented in neutropenic patients were considered too limited to support 
the extension of the indication to neutropenic patients, but - given the relevance to prescribers 
and patients - should be described in section 5.1 of the SmPC.    
 
The available data in non-neutropenic patients with DTI patients may be adequate to support 
adjustment of the SmPC, including the indication.  
In the initial Ecalta marketing application, as the comparator arm contained fluconazole with no activity 
against C.krusei, C.krusei infections were not evaluated.  Therefore, in the data provided for this 
variation application, patients with C.krusei included and the data collected assessed. 
In this variation application, providing additional analyses of the initial MEA 014.3 data, the MAH 
proposes to extend of the Ecalta indication and include neutropenic patients and patients with deep 
tissue infections. In addition, sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated to include information 
on efficacy and safety of anidulafungin in neutropenic patients, patients with DTIs and patients with 
infections caused by C. krusei. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
The following studies have been submitted in support of this variation:

The CHMP assessment of the individual studies is outlined in the Rapporteur’s assessment report for 
MEA 014.3 adopted by the CHMP on 19 September 2013 (Attachment 13).   
For the purpose of this extension of indication application, the MAH has pooled all available data into 
single datasets and the pooled data are discussed in this assessment report.

Endpoints and analyses 
Efficacy endpoints included global, clinical and microbiological responses and were recorded at each 
visit in the MITT population. The global response was a combination of the overall clinical and 
microbiological responses and was derived programmatically for all subjects in the pooled regional 
studies as follows: 
Overall 
Response 
Success 
Clinical 
Overall 
Microbiological 
Global 
Response

For subjects in studies A8851021 and A8851022, the global response was calculated programmatically 
from the overall clinical and microbiological responses as follows:

Any response

For the purpose of this pooled analysis, a response of “Unknown” was considered the same as a 
response of “Indeterminate”.1 A global response of failure at any visit was carried forward as failure at 
all subsequent visits, regardless of whether the response was missing or observed. 
In studies A8851021 and A8851022, responses at the follow-up visit were required only for subjects 
who did not discontinue study drug for any reason. 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in the MITT population with a successful global 
response at their EOIVT visit in each of the pooled data sets. This was reported along with the 95% 
confidence interval. Global response values that were missing or unknown/indeterminate were 
1 Note:  “Indeterminate” was used in studies A8851021 and A8851022; “missing” (microbiological response was 
missing or clinical response was missing) or “unknown” (microbiological response was present and clinical response 
was unknown) were the categories used in the regional studies.

considered as failures in this analysis. Sensitivity analyses which excluded subjects with global 
response values that were missing or unknown/indeterminate was also performed. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints included:  
 
The proportion of subjects in the MITT population with successful global responses at their EOT 
visit in each of the subgroups.  
 
The proportion of subjects in the MITT population with successful clinical and microbiological 
responses at their EOIVT and EOT visits (reported separately for each visit) in each of the 
subgroups. 
 
The proportion of subjects in the MITT population with successful global responses at their EOIVT 
and EOT visits (reported separately for each visit) by baseline pathogen in each of the subgroups. 
 
The overall proportion of subjects in the MITT population who died as well as the proportions of 
subjects in the MITT population who died by Day 14 and Day 28, respectively.  
 
The proportion of subjects in the neutropenic MITT subgroup with successful global responses at 
their EOIVT and EOT visits (reported separately for each visit) for subjects with persistent 
neutropenia and those with resolved neutropenia. 
 
The proportion of subjects in the deep tissue infection MITT subgroup with successful global 
responses at their EOIVT and EOT visits (reported separately for each visit) by baseline site of 
infection. 
The analyses of the secondary endpoints involving the clinical, microbiological and global response 
were similar to the analysis of the primary endpoint. Clinical, microbiological and global responses from 
the follow-up visits were summarized separately for the pooled regional studies and individually for 
studies A8851021 and A8851022. Since studies A8851021 and A8851022 required these responses 
only for subjects who had not discontinued study drug as versus the regional studies which did not 
have such a restriction, these responses were not pooled across the regional studies and studies 
A8851021 or A8851022. The proportions of subjects who died (overall, by Day 14 and by Day 28) 
were calculated out of the total number of MITT subjects. 
Due to the differences in design (controlled vs. open-label) and differences in populations (neutropenia 
based on absolute neutrophil count in study A8851021 vs. neutropenia based on the absolute 
neutrophil count or on investigator report in the open-label studies), the CHMP recognised the 
limitations of pooling data from the comparative and non-comparative studies.  
2.3.2.  Results 
Table 2 summarises the number of subjects enrolled by study and population type. Overall 53 
neutropenic subjects, 131 subjects with DTI and 19 subjects with C. krusei were included in the pooled 
safety analyses for ITT population (i.e. subjects who received at least 1 dose of anidulafungin). Of 
these, 46 neutropenic subjects, 129 subjects with DTI and 19 subjects with C. krusei were included in 
the pooled efficacy analyses for the MITT populations (i.e., subjects treated with at least 1 dose of 
anidulafungin and who had microbiologically confirmed Candida infection).

Because of the low number of evaluable subjects in the comparative treatment group, it is difficult to 
draw meaningful conclusions about the comparative efficacy of the 2 studied echinocandins 
caspofungin (n=3 in the mITT population in study A8851021) and anidulafungin (n=11) in neutropenic 
subjects. The response rates in the anidulafungin arms are provided in Table 6.

Comparison of the response rates generated by the comparative study A8851021 (72.7%) and the 
pooled data generated by the regional studies (51.4%):  is also difficult to interpret due to the small 
sample size. 
Due to the differences in design (controlled vs. open-label) and differences in populations 
(neutropenia based on absolute neutrophil count in study A8851021 vs. neutropenia based on the 
absolute neutrophil count or on investigator-report in the open-label studies), the CHMP noted the 
limitations of pooling data from the comparative and non-comparative studies is considered 
questionable.  
The influence of persistent neutropenia on the response rates is presented in comparison with the 
response rates in patients with resolved neutropenia:  see Table 7. Neutropenia was considered 
resolved if absolute neutrophil count was >500 cells/mm3 before the end of treatment, and persistent 
if absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for the entire treatment duration.

The CHMP agreed that the generated data have shown the contribution of granulocytes in the 
clearance of Candida infections. The reason why this data is provided only from 28 patients and not 
for all subjects is unclear, since this is a routine laboratory measurement with implications for 
therapy. The MAH explained that only for these subjects both baseline and post-baseline 
measurements for absolute neutrophil count were available. The CHMP acknowledged this explanation 
but, considering the severity of disease, the reasons why the measurements were not performed in 
the other 18 patients remains unclear. 
Deep tissue infection 
Anidulafungin provided an overall global response success rate at the EOIVT (primary endpoint) of 
79.1% (Table 8). Treatment response was higher in subjects with infection at a deep tissue site alone 
(n=108) compared to subjects with concomitant blood stream infection (n=21) : 81.5% vs. 66.7%.

The pooled data provides evidence of activity of anidulafungin, but since only 4 patients with 
neutropenia were included in the regional studies (none in the comparative study in the anidulafungin 
arm vs caspofungin that included 26 vs. 13 patients, respectively) the additional contribution of 
granulocytes in resolution of infection cannot be established. 
Candida krusei 
Studies A8851021, A8851022 and the 4 regional studies added 19 subjects with infection due to C. 
krusei to the overall database.  In the pooled analyses, the global response success rate at EOIVT 
(primary endpoint) was 14/19 = 73.7%. Nearly half of subjects identified (8/19, 42.1%) were 
considered neutropenic at baseline.  The global response success rate in these 8 subjects at the EOIVT 
(primary endpoint) was 50.0%, suggesting that immune dysfunction is a significant factor in treatment 
outcome. 
C.krusei  susceptibility was comparable to other non-albicans Candida (except C.parapsilosis) based 
on the breakpoints established by EUCAST. In total 9 from 46 neutropenic patients had invasive 
candidiasis due to C.krusei (19.6%), demonstrating its relevance as pathogen in this patient group 
(Table 5). Anidulafungin demonstrates efficacy in this patient group. Again, the contribution of 
granulocytes to resolution of infection was clear: 73.7% for the total group, 50% for those with 
neutropenia. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A total of 46 neutropenic subjects (global response rate EOIVT 56.5%[42.2%, 70.8%]), 129 subjects 
with DTI (global response rate EOIVT 79.1%[72.0%, 86.1%]) and 19 subjects with C. krusei (global 
response rate EOIVT 73.7% [53.9%, 93.5%]) were included in the overall MITT population pools for 
the efficacy analyses. These results are relatively similar to those in 245 non-neutropenic patients with 
invasive candidiasis (VER002-9) that resulted in registration of anidulafungin: EOIVT 75.6% in the 
anidulafungin group and 60.2% in the fluconazole group. 
The results of the individual studies have been discussed during the post-authorisation procedure MEA 
014.3 (see attachment 13). The presented pooled data in neutropenic patients from all comparative 
and single arm studies show that anidulafungin has  high anti-candida activity regardless of immune 
status of the human host. 
Neutropenia 
From the comparative studies, providing the most relevant data, only 21 patients (15 anidulafungin vs. 
6 caspofungin) provided data on treatment response in neutropenia. Ultimately, only 11 patients in the 
anidulafungin arm contributed to overall analysis (being the MITT population). Therefore, the majority 
(n=35) of the 46 patients with invasive candidiasis and neutropenia were from regional single arm 
studies. Although Candida infection was confirmed in these patients, lack of insight in selection of 
these patients is hampering interpretation of study results from this group. The data generated in this 
group is at most supportive. This is further complicated by the fact that from 18 of these 35 subjects 
no quantitative neutrophil count was presented, but only that the investigator labelled the patient as 
neutropenic. Considering this lack of information in 18/35 patients and the fact that single arm studies 
are not to be pooled with comparative studies, the data should be interpreted with caution.  
EOIVT global response rates in the mITT population in A8851021 were 8/11 (72.7%) and 3/3 (100%) 
for anidulafungin vs. caspofungin. The interpretation of these results is limited by the small number 
due to enrolment issues, which was accepted by the CMHP. These patient numbers are even lower 
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 16/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
than those in comparative studies with micafungin (n=24) and caspofungin (n=14) in neutropenic 
patients, who did however show similar response rates: 75% and 50% respectively. 
The influence of neutropenia was demonstrated in the pooled analysis for 28 from 46 subjects that 
contributed to an analysis to differentiate the influence of persistent vs. resolved neutropenia: global 
response rates 53.8% vs. 80% respectively. 
The methodological concern about pooling data from studies with different study designs is illustrated 
by the differences in response: A8851021 success rate at EOIVT 72.7% and the pooled open-label 
non-comparative studies in 504 candidiasis cases EOIVT 51.4%, which may have been caused by 
higher APACHE II scores in the subjects from regional studies. At most it can be concluded that pooling 
data from the small comparative study and the non-comparative studies did not result in inflated 
response rates due to selection of relatively severe cases in the latter studies. Thus, possible erroneous 
inclusion of 18/35 non-neutropenic patients due to non-recorded neutrophil counts did not result in 
inflated high response rates considering the known deleterious effect of persistent neutropenia on 
outcome.  
The provided data in neutropenic patients from the comparative study is limited but the total number 
of subjects and treatment response appear relatively similar to other patient groups treated with 
anidulafungin or with other echinocandins.  
Following the CHMP discussions, additional information was made available on those patients enrolled 
in comparative studies with no details on the quantification of neutropenia were initially provided. 
Although based on the provided clinical information one could expect that the 11 patients listed are 
neutropenic to some extent, one may not conclude they fulfil the predefined criterion WBC count of ≤
500 cells/mm3 at baseline. The subanalysis for those patients with quantification and those without 
suggest a possible numerical better response at EOT and 2 weeks post treatment, but numbers are too 
small to come to any conclusion. The CHMP agreed that the limitations of these data should be 
adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
Different Candida species 
Whereas in vitro data and determination of susceptibility of Candida species mostly did not show 
differences between the echinocandins in their anti-fungal efficacy (studies by Pfaller et al.), the CHMP 
noted that some studies and animal models did find differences, especially in C.glabrata. Arendrup et 
al. (2012) recently evaluated the in vivo efficacy of the three echinocandins in an immunocompetent 
mouse model (AAC, 2012). Three clinical C. glabrata isolates with or without fks hot spot mutations  
and low, medium, and high echinocandin MICs, respectively were evaluated using three doses of each 
echinocandin. In this study - and in remarkable contrast to caspofungin and micafungin - anidulafungin 
failed to induce a>1-log reduction for any of the isolates. In general, anidulafungin was clearly the less 
active echinocandin against the C.glabrata isolates with a rank order of activity of 
micafungin>caspofungin> anidulafungin. 
In support of these observations, a similar rank order was observed by Andes et al, who investigated 
the in vivo activities of all three echinocandins against Candida spp., including C .glabrata, in a 
neutropenic murine model of disseminated candidiasis (AAC, 2008). Further support comes from a 
study by Spreghini et al, AAC, 2012, who observed that while all three drugs were often fungicidal in 
vitro, they were not able to completely eradicate the infection in this murine neutropenic model of 
Candidiasis and that the efficacy of anidulafungin in a model of C.glabrata infection appeared 
significantly reduced compared to the other echinocandins. 
The extent these in vivo murine observations may have implications for the clinical use of 
anidulafungin is unclear. Overall, the efficacy observed for patients without neutropenia and invasive 
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 17/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
infection with C.glabrata observed in the regional observational trial seems comparable to other 
species and appears is in line with response rates reported for the other echinocandins, but the 
numbers are small. 
In this context, the observed response rate for patients with C.glabrata in the pivotal Reboli trial is of 
particular interest (NEJM, 2007); In contrast to C.albicans in which the response rate and time to 
culture negativity was high and significantly better for anidulafungin compared to fluconazole (81% vs 
62%), the lowest global response rates were observed for C.glabrata with response rates of 56% for 
anidulafungin and 50% for fluconazole. 
Since C.glabrata is a major pathogen in neutropenic patients the implications of decreased 
susceptibility to anidulafungin may impact treatment outcomes and as such may have direct 
consequences for the proposed indication of use of Ecalta in neutropenic patients.  
Therefore, in order to address this concern, MAH re-analysed data from 4 regional studies (A8851011, 
A8851015, A8851016, A8851019), the anidulafungin registrational study (VER002-9), and Studies 
A8851021 and A8851022. The latter 2 were excluded from the neutropenia analysis. In these studies 
149 patients were infected with C. glabrata compared to 388 infections with C. albicans. Baseline 
characteristics were comparable. Global response rates the end of IV therapy (EOIVT), end of all 
therapy (EOT), 2 and 6 Week Follow-Up visit and the rate of all-cause mortality was more or less 
similar for C. glabrata compared to C. albicans, although response rates were numerically slightly 
lower and mortality rates slightly higher. Due to the absence of confidence intervals one cannot 
conclude non-difference between the 2 pathogens. Furthermore data need to be interpreted with care 
as they are derived from different studies and patients with different underlying conditions may have 
contributed unevenly the response to therapy.  
Interestingly, the results from the neutropenic subpopulation suggests a slightly better response to 
treatment for C. glabrata strains, although numbers are too small for final conclusions.  
Based on the expected susceptibility (EUCAST) it is to be expected that  C. glabrata infections should 
respond to anidulafungin treatment. Patients with candidemia usually have complex underlying 
conditions that may contribute to their overall response to treatment and survival and pathogenicity of 
C. albicans and C. glabrata may differ these patients. Candidemia was diagnosed in more than 80% of 
the patients.  
Despite these uncertainties, the CHMP concluded that the number of patients infected with C. glabrata 
in the different studies and the EUCAST epidemiological distribution on more than 300 observations 
provide a sufficient level of evidence to suggest that anidulafungin may have an acceptable response in 
these patients. 
Deep tissue infection 
Study A8851022 was a descriptive randomized, double-blind comparative study to evaluate efficacy 
and safety of anidulafungin (n=26) compared to caspofungin (n=13) in the treatment of patients with 
DTI. Despite efforts to improve enrolment, the planned number of patients was not attained in this 
study. On approval of the study design, it was already noted that the study was not powered to 
provide conclusive evidence of comparative efficacy and safety in this population. Despite this 
limitation, an acceptable treatment effect was observed: EOT were 20 (83.3%) of 24 subjects and 8 
(61.5%) of 13 subjects for anidulafungin vs caspofungin, respectively. This was, furthermore, 
confirmed by pooled results in a relatively large number of patients (n=105) from open-label non-
comparative studies that did include only 4 neutropenic patients.  
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 18/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The overall success rate at EOIVT in the pooled analysis (79.1%) was numerically higher than the 
success rate reported in a study of micafungin versus caspofungin (Pappas et al, 2007) in non-
candaemic patients with deep tissue candidiasis (53.4% [31/58] and 57.7% [15/26], respectively). 
In total, data on 129 patients with DTI were submitted. The available data are considered supportive 
and consistent across studies and across sites of infection. This may be reflected in the SmPC. No 
misclassification of neutropenia can influence results in these cohorts, since only 4 from 129 were 
neutropenic, with little influence on final outcome. 
C. krusei 
The CHMP agrees that, compared to other Candida spp. and other patient groups, overall treatment 
response was similar for C.krusei infections. This supports the inclusion of this pathogen in the 
indication of anidulafungin. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The evaluation of efficacy in neutropenic patients is based on a limited number of patients and very 
limited comparative data. However, based on the available data, the efficacy data from non-
neutropenic patients and the absence of any clear efficacy concerns in neutropenic patients, the 
extension of indication by not excluding neutropenic patients is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
2.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety profile of anidulafungin in the currently approved SmPC was originally determined based on 
204 subjects from the registrational Phase 3 study (ICC dataset).  For this submission the two 
comparative studies (A8851021, A8851022) and four open-label (A8851011, A8851015, A8851016, 
A8851019) studies were pooled into single datasets: neutropenic subjects (n=53, 15 subjects in Study 
A8851021 and 38 subjects in the regional studies), subjects with deep tissue candidiasis (n=131, 26 
subjects in Study A8851022 and 105 subjects in the regional studies), and subjects with infection due 
to C. krusei (n=19) who all received at least 1 dose of anidulafungin. Baseline characteristics were 
relatively similar between studies, except for higher APACHE II scores in the regional studies (more 
severely ill).

Due to the low sample sizes in Studies A8851021 and A8851022, differences with the regional studies 
as well as any potential differences in frequencies with caspofungin are not likely to be informative and 
should be interpreted with caution. No new safety data was identified. 
Adverse Events 
Most common AEs were compared between the different study populations, without major differences 
from the original data (ICC data set) from registration.

SAEs were reported in 56.6% of neutropenic subjects, 58.8% of subjects with DTI, 57.9% of subjects 
with C. krusei, and 50.0% of subjects in the ICC dataset, without showing new safety data. 
Death  
Anidulafungin treated subjects had an AE with an outcome of death in 47.2% of neutropenic subjects, 
32.1% of subjects with DTI, 42.1% of subjects with C. krusei and 23.5% of subjects in the ICC 
dataset.  Although higher than in the ICC dataset, the individual cases resulting in death in the 3 
populations were carefully reviewed and the AEs associated with the fatal outcome in the 3 populations 
were due to the patient’s underlying disease or its complications or co-morbidities. 
Discontinuation  
AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of anidulafungin in 18.9% of neutropenic subjects, 6.9% of 
subjects with DTI, and 15.8% of subjects with C. krusei, and 10.3% of subjects in the ICC dataset. The 
main causes of the discontinuations were the underlying diseases or concurrent diseases with the 
exception of 2 neutropenic subjects: hypotension and tachycardia in 1 subject and convulsion in the 
other.  The convulsion continued despite discontinuing anidulafungin. 
Comparison comparative studies vs regional studies 
There was a higher rate of AEs in the regional studies than in Studies A8851021 or A8851022.  This 
may be reflective of the fact that subjects in the regional studies appeared to be more severely ill as 
evidenced by the slightly higher mean APACHE II score and higher frequency of subjects with APACHE 
II scores >20.  Due to the low sample sizes in Studies A8851021 and A8851022, differences with the 
regional studies as well as any potential differences in frequencies with the comparator (caspofungin) 
are not likely to be informative and should be interpreted with caution.   
Comparison anidulafungin vs caspofungin 
The review of anidulafungin safety data from comparative studies (A8851021 and A8851022) 
compared to the caspofungin data within the study and compared to the safety data from the 
appropriate regional subject pools did not identify any new safety information. 
Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Associated Reactions 
These reactions are important identified risks in the RMP. A total of 24 neutropenic subjects, 48 
subjects with DTI and 11 subjects with C. krusei, reported 43, 65 and 16 potential anaphylactic 
reactions respectively.  A review of the details of each case returned by the search, confirmed that 
none of these cases actually showed events of anaphylaxis.   
A total of 12 neutropenic subjects, 23 subjects with DTI and 6 subjects with C. krusei, reported 15, 29 
and 6 potential IARs respectively.  A review of the events potentially representing symptoms of IARs 
suggests that majority of these AEs were associated with the underlying diseases or their 
complications rather than reflecting true IARs.  The remaining AEs that were likely due to 
administration of anidulafungin were mild to moderate and resolved.  A head to head comparison of 
the frequency of these events to the ICC dataset is not possible as the timing of AE occurrence was not 
captured for the ICC dataset.  For comparison, in the literature the rate of infusion related reactions for 
caspofungin was reported as 20.2%. 
Hepatobiliary events 
Heptobiliary disorders represent an important identified risk with administration of anidulafungin per 
the RMP.  The MAH is closely monitoring hepatobiliary events and as part of a post approval 
commitment is planning on conducting a post authorisation safety study (PASS) as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity for this risk (Study A8851030: A Retrospective Cohort Study of the Risk of 
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 21/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Severe Hepatic Injury in Hospitalised Patients Treated with Echinocandins for Candida Infections).The 
rate of AEs reporting Hepatobiliary disorders for the 3 populations was lower than that for the ICC 
dataset (20.8% of neutropenic subjects, 19.8% of subjects with DTI, and 15.8% of subjects with C. 
krusei, and 25.9% of subjects in the ICC dataset). No true cases of Hy’s law were reported in any of 
the 3 populations. 
Other risks 
A review of cases of convulsion and potential events of QTc prolongation/Torsades de Pointes identified 
no new safety information.   
Laboratory measurements 
A head to head comparison of haematology parameters between the ICC dataset and the pooled 
dataset was not possible due to the differences in the abnormality criteria applied at the time of the 
analysis. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No new safety information was derived from analyses in the 3 treatment groups. All AE rates are lower 
or similar to those reported in the ICC dataset. There are currently no known drug-drug interactions 
with anidulafungin, and dosage adjustment in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment is not 
required. Given the increased clinical experience of anidulafungin use (from 204 patients in the original 
submission to 840 patients evaluated in the clinical studies up to date) section 4.8 of the SmPC is 
proposed to be updated. Infusion related reactions require mentioning in the SmPC, because 
potentially infusion related AEs occurred in 17.6%-31.6% although no true cases of anaphylaxis were 
reported. Hepatobiliary disorders – present in 15.8-20.8%, predominantly increase of alkaline 
phosphatase are subject to post-approval commitments. 
Although no new safety information was obtained from subjects in different treatment groups, 
compared to the anidulafungin-treated subjects in Study A8851021, the subjects in the regional 
studies reported more SAEs (63.2% vs. 40%) and more severe AEs (60.5% vs. 46.7%) but there were 
less discontinuations due to AEs (15.8% vs. 26.7%) or temporary discontinuations due to AEs (2.6% 
vs. 6.7%).  The higher rate of SAEs in the regional studies may be reflective of the higher mean 
APACHE II score in those studies which suggests that the patient population within the regional studies 
was more severely ill.   
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the review of the available safety data, the CHMP agreed that no new safety concerns were 
noticed in the evaluated patients. 
2.4.5.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 22/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
No changes were made to the risk minimisation measures. Routine risk minimisation measures remain 
sufficient to minimise the risks of anidulafungin in the authorised indication. 
No additional risk minimisation activities are considered necessary. 
The elements for the public summary have updated to reflect the changes to the RMP. This is 
accepted.  
2.6.  Update of the Product information   
Following the assessment of the available data, the CHMP agreed to extend the indication of Ecalta and  
update the section 4.1 of the Ecalta SmPC to:  
Treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).   
As a consequence of this new indication, section 4.4 was updated to warn that the efficacy of Ecalta 
has only been evaluated in a limited number of neutropenic patients and delete the mention that 
patient with known C.krusei infection have not been studied. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been also been updated to reflect the updated efficacy and safety data in the neutropenic and non-
neutropenic with deep tissue infections patients .  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the Product Information to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD 
template which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Initially, in order to overcome possible limitations in interpretation of results due to small sample size 
in the comparative studies and subsequently provide justification of the extension of indication in 
neutropenic patients (n=46), deep tissue infections (n=108) and C.krusei infections (n=19), that 
partly overlap, the MAH pooled and submitted all available data on efficacy and safety of anidulafungin 
both from the two comparative studies and from four other single arm studies. The data were obtained 
from 2 comparative studies with caspofungin as comparator (neutropenia: 11 and 3 subjects in the 
anidulafungin and caspofungin arm; and deep tissue infection 26 and 13 subjects, respectively) and 
from 4 single arm open-label studies with 504 subjects with microbiologically confirmed invasive 
candidiasis, from whom 35 subjects with neutropenia. The data from the latter 4 studies had been 
pooled and submitted as such during the post-authorisation measure procedure (MEA 014.3), which 
was accepted since these studies were relatively similar in design. 
Following the list of questions, the MAH discussed data from 4 regional studies (A8851011, A8851015, 
A8851016, A8851019), the anidulafungin registrational study (VER002-9), and Follow-Up Measure 
Studies A8851021 and A8851022 (excluded from the neutropenia analysis). These studies included 
748 patients in the MITT population for whom 55 patients with neutropenia, subdivided as follows for 
the different species: C. albicans (N=388), C. glabrata (N=149), C. parapsilosis (N=97), C. tropicalis 
(N=95) and C. krusei (N=19).  
Benefits 
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 23/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Beneficial effects 
- 
The response rate in neutropenic patients 8/11  (72.7%) in the comparative study was similar to 
that in non-neutropenic patients (75.6%).  
- 
For invasive candidiasis similar global response rates were shown as have been reported in 
neutropenic patients for the other two compounds of the class of echinocandins:  caspofungin 
(50%) and micafungin (75%), which underlines the similarities in their class-specific shared 
mechanism of anti-fungal activity. 
- 
The total number of included neutropenic patients in the comparative trial (n=11 in the 
anidulafungin arm) was similar to those in studies with other echinocandins (n=14 in caspofungin 
study, n=24 in micafungin study) allowing a tentative comparison demonstrating similar response 
rates. 
- 
In the other non-comparative single arm studies that included 35 neutropenic patients with 
invasive candidiasis who received anidulafungin, the global response rate at end of intravenous 
treatment was 18/35 (51.4%), which supports the findings from the comparative study and is in 
line with results with other echinocandins.  
-  Overall response rate in neutropenic patients based in the updated analysis following the first 
round of questions was 31/55 (56%), which is numerically slightly lower but includes data from 
studies and with low numbers can not exclude similar responsiveness. 
-  Results in the neutropenic patients suggested a slightly better response for C. glabrata. C. glabrata 
is a frequent cause of infection in neutropenic patients, at this stage, and acknowledging the 
limitations of numbers of patients, these data are sufficient to recommend empiric use of 
anidulafungin in these patients at this stage. 
- 
The global response rate in deep tissue infections was relative similar to that in candidemia as has 
been achieved with anidulafungin, which reflects adequate tissue penetration. In comparison with 
the other echinocandins efficacy in this type of infection was at least similar (79.1% vs. 53.4% in 
micafungin and 57.7% in caspofungin). 
- 
In C.krusei infection, a fungal pathogen not susceptible to fluconazole, anidulafungin demonstrated 
similar global response rates as the overall response rate. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
- 
The submitted overall efficacy results by pooling data from studies with different study designs: 
both comparative and non-comparative studies, is not methodologically validated. Data from 
pooled single-arm studies is only considered supportive at most.  
- 
Included numbers of neutropenic patients were low, therefore comparisons of efficacy in 
neutropenic patients between comparative studies and non-comparative single arm studies and 
between the other echinocandins and anidulafungin are of limited value. 
- 
The interpretation of data was additionally compromised by the inclusion of patients without 
quantitative neutrophil count at baseline (18/35 neutropenic patients in the regional studies) for 
unknown reasons, was explained by the MAH in the response to questions. However, for 11 
patients there is still no quantification of neutropenia. This should be reflected in the SmPC (see 
SmPC assessment, Annex I). 
-  Overall 149 patients infected with C. glabrata, a pathogen frequently unsusceptible to fluconazole, 
showed more or less similar response rates to C. albicans at different follow up times although 
EMA/605066/2014  
Page 24/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
numerically response rate was slightly lower and mortality rate was slightly higher. Due to the 
absence of confidence intervals one can not conclude non-difference.  
Risks 
- 
Patients were exposed during about 14 days of anidulafungin i.v. followed by oral azoles. No new 
safety data from the 3 treatment groups was obtained. 
Unfavourable effects 
-  Hepatobiliary disorders were frequent (20%). A PASS study to further investigate hepatotoxicity in 
echinocandins is agreed (to be submitted). 
- 
Potential anaphylactic reaction appear frequently (~20%), although true cases of anaphylaxis did 
not occur. 
- 
Treatment discontinuations occurred more frequently in neutropenic patients (18.9%) than in the 
ICC data base (10.3%), although most were related to underlying illness. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
-  Due to the small numbers in the comparative studies a safety benefit of anidulafungin over 
caspofungin could not be determined. 
-  Due to different study designs (comparative vs. non-comparative studies) the data from the 
comparative studies that only included 50 patients in the safety population, cannot be compared 
with data obtained in 595 subjects from open-label single arm studies. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The proposed extension of indication to treatment of invasive candidiasis also in neutropenic patients  
is supported by data from a limited number of neutropenic patients. The premature termination of the 
comparative study due to slow enrolment has been accepted by the CHMP (see MEA 014.3 assessment 
report). Furthermore, efficacy data in neutropenic patients was supported by earlier results from single 
arm studies. The submitted study data from this limited number of patients show similar outcomes as 
have been shown in non-neutropenic patients receiving anidulafungin, and as have been recorded in 
neutropenic patients receiving other antifungal agents within the same class. Despite the limitations, it 
appears that this holds for all Candida species and for neutropenic patients who are especially prone to 
infection with C.glabrata. Based on the MAH’s responses of the questions raised, the currently 
proposed broad indication of candida treatment in all types of patients, in particular neutropenic 
patients, can be accepted. 
The evaluation of efficacy in neutropenic patients is based on a limited number of patients and very 
limited comparative data. However, based on the available data, the efficacy data from non-
neutropenic patients and the absence of any clear efficacy concerns in neutropenic patients, the 
extension of indication by not excluding neutropenic patients is acceptable. 
No new safety concerns were noticed in the evaluated patients.

4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s): 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
II 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Following the CHMP assessment of efficacy and safety data of Ecalta in neutropenic patients with 
invasive candidiasis and non-neutropenic patients with Cancida spp. deep tissue infection (MEA 014.3), 
extension of indication to include neutropenic patient for Ecalta. 
As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add a warning, 
update the safety information and reflect additional data in neutropenic patients. The Package Leaflet 
is updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the Product Information is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.

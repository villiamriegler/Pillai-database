SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety 
and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the 
benefit-risk balance of Juluca in the approved 
indication remains favourable and therefore 
recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Submission of the final report from study 200336 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 
prospective, interventional pharmacokinetic and 
safety study of DTG/ABC/3TC in pregnant women. 
The summary of objective of this PASS study is to 
investigate the use of DTG during pregnancy and 
Section 4.6. 
Pregnancy 
Dolutegravir crosses the placenta in humans. In 
pregnant women living with HIV, the median 
foetal umbilical cord concentration of 
dolutegravir was approximately 1.3-fold greater 
compared with the maternal peripheral plasma 
concentration. 
There is insufficient information on the effects of 
dolutegravir on neonates. 
Breast-feeding 
A median dolutegravir breast milk to maternal 
plasma ratio of 0.033 has been shown.

Following the finalisation of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/WS1810 concerning submission of 
EuroSIDA (category 3 PASS) study, this Type II 
worksharing variation was proposed to address the 
removal of three important risks (Dolutegravir 
Hypersensitivity reactions, Hepatobiliary reactions 
and Serious rash) from all four dolutegravir-
containing product EU-RMPs; Tivicay (dolutegravir), 
Triumeq (dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine), Dovato 
(dolutegravir/lamivudine) and Juluca 
(dolutegravir/rilpivirine) - i.e. deletion of safety 
concerns.  
In addition, the MAH took opportunity to propose a 
harmonisation of the risks across all four 
dolutegravir-containing product EU-RMPs and other 
minor updates (including study details and 
epidemiology data). 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed 
amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

dolutegravir / rilpivirine fixed dose combination 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add “completed 
suicide” to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
with frequency ”rare” in the dolutegravir (Tivicay), 
dolutegravir/ abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq) and 
dolutegravir/lamivudine (Dovato) following the 
finalisation of PSUSA procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010075/202101 (reporting 
period 17 Jan 2020 to 16 Jan 2021) based on reports 
of completed suicide from participants exposed to 
dolutegravir containing regimen in ViiV Healthcare-
sponsored clinical trials. As the changes impact all 
dolutegravir containing products, the MAH submitted 
a worksharing procedure to include 
Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (Juluca) product in 
accordance with Article 20 (worksharing procedure) 
of Commission Regulation (EC) 1234/2008. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in section 4 with a rather 
identical wording.  
The proposed wording should be as follows (identical 
with the suggested wording by the MAH regarding 
Dovato (footnote instead of brackets for the 
explanatory wording is acceptable to be in line with 
already included footnote on suicidal ideation and 
suicide attempt), Triumeq and Juluca. Nevertheless, 
the wording in section 4 for Tivicay is not exactly the 
same as for the other three products and should be 
Page 5/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therefore adapted accordingly).  
Furthermore, it could be considered to add a 
statement for patients in section of the PL that they 
should consult their doctor especially if 
neuropsychiatric side effects occur, since only under 
this condition an adequate reaction by the HCPs 
(knowledge of the adverse effects) is possible.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC of Triumeq and 
Tivicay to include elevated bilirubin levels in 
combination with increased transaminases in patients 
treated with DTG-containing regimens (data from 
EuroSIDA and 14 other clinical trials), classified as 
‘rare’ (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and labelled under 
the SOC “Hepatobiliary disorders”.  
In addition, the MAH updated the Package Leaflet of 
Triumeq and Tivicay to include increase in bilirubin 
levels as rare side effect. 
Furthermore, in line with the SmPC guideline, all 
laboratory findings related to hepatitis / acute 
hepatic failure, i.e. including ALT and AST elevations 
currently listed under the SOC “Investigations”, were 
moved to the SOC “Hepatobiliary disorders” in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC of Triumeq and Tivicay.

the safety information regarding the occurrence of 
neural tube defects with the dolutegravir -containing 
regimens based on the interim analysis from the 
Tsepamo study. This is a birth outcomes surveillance 
study being conducted in Botswana that was 
designed to evaluate adverse birth outcomes by HIV 
status and antiretroviral regimen, and to determine if 
there is an increased risk of neural tube defects 
among infants exposed to efavirenz at conception. 
This surveillance system captures all antiretroviral 
exposure including dolutegravir.  
The PL is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
Juluca and Dovato (dolutegravir-based products)

Botswana (the Tsepamo study). This is an 
observational cohort study focusing on the safety 
of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and 
was designed to evaluate adverse birth 
outcomes by HIV status and antiretroviral 
regimen.

from the study shows a small increase of neural 
tube defects; 7 cases in 3,591 deliveries

19,361 (0.11%: 95% CI 0.07%, 0.17%) women 
exposed to non-DTG regimens at the time of 
conception. 
The SmPC has been updated to include advice 
for women of childbearing potential to be 
counselled about the potential risk of NTD with 
DTG, including consideration of effective 
contraceptive measures. 
In addition, a recommendation to discuss the 
benefits and risks of continuing DTG versus 
switching to another antiretroviral regimen has 
been added in the case when a pregnancy is 
confirmed in the first trimester while on DTG.

products with narrow therapeutic windows that are 
substrates of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), 
including but not limited to fampridine (also known 
as dalfampridine).The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the products information 
have been updated to reflect the following changes: 
- 
remove the drug-drug interactions for 
products no longer authorised in the EU (boceprevir, 
dofetilide, nelfinavir) 
- 
remove the inverted triangle for additional 
monitoring for Dovato only.

dolutegravir/rilpivirine fixed dose combination

warn of concurrent administration of dolutegravir 
with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic 
windows, that are substrates of OCT-2, including 
but not limited to fampridine (also known as 
dalfampridine).  
Fampridine is a substrate of OCT2 with a narrow 
therapeutic index and could show an increased 
risk of seizures at elevated concentrations. 
While the proposed interaction has not been 
formally investigated in a drug interaction study 
for dolutegravir, the contradiction is accepted 
given the information stated in the approved 
product labelling for fampridine, and the 
understanding of dolutegravir potential to inhibit 
OCT2.

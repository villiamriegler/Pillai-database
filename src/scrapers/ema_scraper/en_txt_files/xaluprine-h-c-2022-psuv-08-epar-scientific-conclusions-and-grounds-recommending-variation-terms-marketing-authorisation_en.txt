Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Xaluprine, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
An article describing hypoglycaemia in a child treated with 6-mercaptopurine has been identified by the 
MAH. In addition, there are at least 5 other relevant articles describing hypoglycaemia in association 
with 6-mercaptopurine. A potential causal relationship of hypoglycaemia to Xaluprine is at least 
possible and therefore it is proposed to include hypoglycaemia as a warning in section 4.4 and as an 
adverse event in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Some cases of ‘photosensitivity reactions’ in association with Xaluprine have been identified. Although 
the number of cases is limited there is at least one case (positive re-challenge) with a possible causality 
with 6-mercaptopurine. Taken this together the proposal is to update the SmPC to include 
photosensitivity reaction in section 4.8.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding hypoglycaemia and photosensitivity reactions, the PRAC 
considered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the 
scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Xaluprine, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance mercaptopurine is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

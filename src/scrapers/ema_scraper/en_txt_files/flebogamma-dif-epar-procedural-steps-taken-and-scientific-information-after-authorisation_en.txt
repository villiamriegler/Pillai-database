C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
are updated in line with the EMA core SmPC guideline for 
human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous 
administration. The main changes concern the wording of 
SID and the addition of MMN and CIDP therapeutic 
indications. 
Results from study IG0601 are in accordance with efficacy 
results from other IVIGs and in line with information 
already contained in Flebogamma DIF SmPC. The safety 
results did not raise any new ADRs; the frequency and 
Page 5/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severity reflect similar patterns to those seen with other 
IVIGs.  
The table on adverse drug reactions of the SmPC for both 
strengths is revised based on all completed studies 
previously submitted. Overall, the source of the safety 
database is from clinical trials and post-authorisation safety 
studies in a total of 128 patients exposed to Flebogamma 
DIF 50 mg/ml (with a total of 1318 infusions) and in a total 
of 160 patients exposed to Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml 
(with a total of 915 infusions). The update for Flebogamma 
DIF 100 mg/ml includes also final results for study IG0601.  
The RMP is updated to add MMN and CIDP indications and 
to conform to the Guideline on GVP Module V rev.2. The list 
of safety concerns is revised to add lupus-like syndrome as 
an important potential risk to remove hereditary fructose 
intolerance and use in paediatric population under 2 years 
old from the important potential risk and the missing 
information, respectively.

Based on review of date available since granting of the 
Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP confirmed that the 
benefit-risk balance for this product remained positive. 
However, the CHMP recommended that an additional 
renewal is requested in 5 years, due to limited post-
marketing experience and the need to further monitor the 
safety profile. In addition, during this procedure, the SmPC 
has been updated to better address the potential risks 
related to presence of an excipient sorbitol (regarding use

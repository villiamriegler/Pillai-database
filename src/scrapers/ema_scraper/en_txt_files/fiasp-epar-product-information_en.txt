Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin for subcutaneous administration up to 2 minutes before the start of the 
meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the meal (see section 5.1). 
Dosing with Fiasp is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Fiasp 
given by subcutaneous injection should be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-
acting insulin given at least once a day. In a basal-bolus treatment regimen approximately 50% of this 
requirement may be provided by Fiasp and the remaining by intermediate-acting or long-acting 
insulin. 
The individual total daily insulin requirement in adults, adolescents and children may vary and is 
usually between 0.5 and 1 unit/kg/day. 
Blood glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustment are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic 
control. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. Blood glucose levels should be monitored adequately under 
these conditions. 
The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level 
of physical activity. 
Patients on basal-bolus treatment who forget a mealtime dose are advised to monitor their blood 
glucose level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Patients should resume their usual dosing schedule 
at the next meal. 
The potency of insulin analogues, including Fiasp, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of Fiasp 
corresponds to 1 international unit of human insulin or 1 unit of other fast-acting insulin analogues. 
The early onset of action must be considered when prescribing Fiasp (see section 5.1). 
Initiation 
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
The recommended starting dose in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately 50% of 
the total daily insulin dose and should be divided between the meals based on the size and composition 
of the meals. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as intermediate-
acting or long-acting insulin. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight 
can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Suggested initial dose is 4 units at one or more meals. Number of injections and subsequent titration 
will depend on the individual glycaemic target and the size and composition of the meals. 
Dose adjustment may be considered daily based on self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) on the 
previous day(s) according to Table 1.

Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) 
The safety and efficacy of Fiasp have been established in elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years. Close 
glucose monitoring is recommended and the insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis 
(see section 5.1 and 5.2). The therapeutic experience in patients ≥ 75 years of age is limited. 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. In patients with renal impairment, 
glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. In patients with hepatic 
impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Fiasp can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 1 year (see section 5.1). There is no 
clinical experience with the use of Fiasp in children below the age of 2 years. 
Fiasp is recommended to be administered prior to the meal (0-2 minutes), with the flexibility to 
administer up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about the 
meal intake. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer from other mealtime insulins and in the 
initial weeks thereafter. Converting from another mealtime insulin can be done on a unit-to-unit basis. 
Transferring a patient from another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin to Fiasp must be done under 
strict medical supervision and may result in the need for a change in dose. 
Doses and timing of concurrent intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin medicinal products or other 
concomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. 
Method of administration  
Subcutaneous injection 
Fiasp is recommended to be administered subcutaneously by injection in the abdominal wall or the 
upper arm (see section 5.2). Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to 
reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Fiasp 100 units/mL FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The pre-filled pen (FlexTouch) delivers 1–80 units in steps of 1 unit. 
FlexTouch is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instructions for use to be followed. For 
instructions on administration, see “Instructions for Use” at the end of the package leaflet. 
The pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe or 
intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If administration by infusion pump is 
necessary, a vial or a PumpCart cartridge should be used.

If administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If 
administration by infusion pump is necessary, a vial or a PumpCart cartridge should be used (see 
section 6.6). 
Fiasp 100 units/mL solution for injection in vial 
Administration with a syringe 
The vial is to be used with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale (units-100 or 
100 units/mL). 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) 
Fiasp solution for injection in vial can be used for CSII in pumps suitable for insulin infusion and will 
cover both the bolus insulin requirement (approximately 50%) and basal insulin. It can be 
administered in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer, preferably in the 
abdomen. When used with an insulin infusion pump, it should not be diluted or mixed with any other 
insulin medicinal products. 
Patients using CSII should be instructed in the use of the pump and use the correct reservoir and 
tubing for pump (see section 6.6). The infusion set (tubing and cannula) should be changed in 
accordance with the instructions in the product information supplied with the infusion set. 
Patients administering Fiasp by CSII must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have 
alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure.  
Fiasp 100 units/mL PumpCart solution for injection in cartridge 
Administration via CSII  
The cartridge (PumpCart) is only for use with an insulin infusion pump system designed to be used 
with this cartridge (see section 6.6). 
Fiasp will cover both the bolus insulin requirement (approximately 50%) and basal insulin. It can be 
administered in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer, preferably in the 
abdomen. Infusion site should be rotated within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. 
Patients using CSII should be instructed in the use of the pump and use the correct tubing for pump 
(see section 6.6). The infusion set (tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the 
instructions in the product information supplied with the infusion set. 
Patients administering Fiasp by CSII must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have 
alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure.  
The cartridge (PumpCart) is only suitable for CSII in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion. If 
administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. 
Intravenous use 
Fiasp 100 units/mL solution for injection in vial 
If necessary, Fiasp can be administered intravenously by health care professionals. 
For intravenous use, it should be used at concentrations from 0.5 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL insulin aspart 
in infusion systems – using polypropylene infusion bags. 
Fiasp must not be mixed with any other insulin or any other medicinal product except those mentioned 
in section 6.6. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 
6.6 
Monitoring of blood glucose is necessary during insulin infusion. Care should be taken to ensure that 
the insulin is injected into the infusion bag and not simply the entry port.  
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Hypoglycaemia  
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.  
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see 
sections 4.8 and 4.9).  
Patients, whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with long-standing diabetes.  
The timing of hypoglycaemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin 
formulation. Hypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an injection/infusion when compared to other 
mealtime insulins due to the earlier onset of action of Fiasp (see section 5.1).  
Since Fiasp should be administered up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal with the option to 
administer up to 20 minutes after starting the meal, the time to onset of action must be taken into 
account when prescribing to patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed 
absorption of food might be expected.  
Paediatric population  
Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is recommended if administering this medicinal product after 
the start of the last meal of the day, in order to avoid nocturnal hypoglycaemia.  
Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis  
The use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients requiring insulin, 
may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.  
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)  
Pump or infusion set malfunctions can lead to a fast onset of hyperglycaemia and ketosis. Prompt 
identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycaemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim therapy 
with subcutaneous injection may be required.  
Misuse of PumpCart  
The cartridge (PumpCart) is only for use with an insulin infusion pump system designed to be used 
with this cartridge. It must not be used with other devices not designed for the cartridge, as this may 
result in incorrect insulin dosing and subsequent hyper- or hypoglycaemia (see section 6.6).  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medicinal products may be considered.  
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal, human insulin or human 
insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may 
result in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Fiasp from another type of insulin may 
require a change in dose from that used with their usual insulin medicinal products.  
Concomitant illness  
Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s 
insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.  
Combination of pioglitazone and insulin medicinal products  
Cases of congestive heart failure have been reported when pioglitazone were used in combination with 
insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of congestive heart failure. This should 
be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of Pioglitazone and insulin medicinal products is 
considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of 
congestive heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any 
deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.  
Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification  
Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, 
reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, acute painful 
peripheral neuropathy and peripheral oedema. However, long-term glycaemic control decreases the 
risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.  
Insulin antibodies  
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin 
antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia.  
Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors  
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between this medicinal product and other insulin medicinal products.  
Patients must visually verify the units of the dose prior to administering. Therefore, the requirement 
for patients to self-administer is that they can read the dose scale. Patients, who are blind or have poor 
vision, must be instructed to always get assistance from another person who has good vision and is 
trained in administration of insulins.  
Travelling between time zones  
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice.  
Excipients  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. 
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement: 
Oral antidiabetics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids, sulphonamides and GLP-1 receptor agonist. 
The following substances may increase insulin requirement: 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy  
Fiasp can be used in pregnancy.  
Data from two randomised controlled clinical trials conducted with insulin aspart (322 + 27 exposed 
pregnancies) do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin aspart on pregnancy or on the health of the 
foetus/new born when compared to soluble human insulin.  
Intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes (type 1 diabetes, 
type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes) are recommended throughout pregnancy and when 
contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase 
subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally 
return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values.  
Breast-feeding  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the 
breast-feeding mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the dose may need to be adjusted.  
Fertility  
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human 
insulin regarding fertility.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g., driving a car or 
using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances.

trials in adults. Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention: Very common 
(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic skin manifestations reported with Fiasp (1.8% vs. 1.5% for comparator) include eczema, rash, 
rash pruritic, urticaria and dermatitis. 
With Fiasp generalised hypersensitivity reactions (manifested by generalised skin rash and facial 
oedema) was reported uncommonly (0.2% vs. 0.3% for comparator).  
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe 
hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or 
permanent impairment of brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur 
suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, 
unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, 
vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Hypoglycaemia may occur 
earlier after an injection/infusion of Fiasp compared to other mealtime insulins due to the earlier onset 
of action. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Lipodystrophy was reported at the injection/infusion 
site in patients treated with Fiasp (0.5% vs. 0.2% in comparator). Continuous rotation of the injection 
site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4).  
Injection/infusion site reactions 
Injection site reactions (including rash, redness, inflammation, pain and bruising) were reported in 
patients treated with Fiasp (1.3% vs. 1.0% in comparator). In patients using CSII (N=261): Infusion 
site reactions (including redness, inflammation, irritation, pain, bruising and itching) were reported in 
patients treated with Fiasp (10.0% vs. 8.3% in comparator). These reactions are usually mild and 
transitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment. 
Paediatric population 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety and efficacy have been investigated in a therapeutic confirmatory trial in children with type 1 
diabetes aged 2 to less than 18 years. In the trial, 519 patients were treated with Fiasp. Overall the 
frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the paediatric population do not indicate 
differences to the experience in the adult population. Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, 
lipoatrophy) at the injection site was reported more often in this trial with paediatric patients compared 
to trials in adults (see above). In the paediatric population lipodystrophy was reported with a frequency 
of 2.1% for Fiasp vs. 1.6% for NovoRapid.  
Other special populations 
Based on results from clinical trials with insulin aspart in general, the frequency, type and severity of 
adverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not 
indicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. The safety profile in very 
elderly patients (≥ 75 years) or patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment is limited. Fiasp has been administered to elderly patients for the investigation of 
pharmacokinetic properties (see section 5.2).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if a patient is dosed with more insulin than required: 
• 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or other products 
containing sugar. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries glucose-
containing products. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient is not able to treat him/herself, can be treated 
with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or 
with glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given 
intravenously if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon 
regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
order to prevent a relapse. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting 
ATC code: A10AB05. 
Mechanism of action 
Fiasp is a fast-acting insulin aspart formulation. 
The primary activity of Fiasp is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin 
aspart, the active substance in Fiasp, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. 
Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by facilitating cellular uptake of glucose into skeletal 
muscle and adipose tissue and by inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver. Insulin inhibits 
lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin aspart formulation in which the addition of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) 
results in a faster initial absorption of insulin compared to NovoRapid. 
The onset of action was 5 minutes earlier and time to maximum glucose infusion rate was 11 minutes 
earlier with Fiasp than with NovoRapid. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of Fiasp occurred 
between 1 and 3 hours after injection. The glucose-lowering effect during the first 30 minutes 
(AUCGIR, 0–30 min ) was 51 mg/kg with Fiasp and 29 mg/kg with NovoRapid (Fiasp/NovoRapid ratio: 
1.74 [1.47;2.10]95% CI). The total glucose-lowering effect and maximum (GIRmax) glucose-lowering 
effect were comparable between Fiasp and NovoRapid. Total and maximum glucose-lowering effect 
of Fiasp increase linearly with increasing dose within the therapeutic dose range. 
Fiasp has an earlier onset of action compared to NovoRapid (see section 5.2), leading to a subsequent 
increased early glucose-lowering effect. This must be considered when prescribing Fiasp. 
The duration of action was shorter for Fiasp compared to that of NovoRapid and lasted for 3–5 hours. 
The day-to-day variability within-patients in glucose-lowering effect was low for Fiasp both for early 
(AUCGIR, 0-1h, CV~26%), total (AUCGIR, 0-12h, CV~18%) and maximum glucose-lowering effect 
(GIRmax, CV~19%). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Fiasp has been studied in 2 068 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (1 143 patients) and type 2 diabetes 
(925 patients) in 3 randomised efficacy and safety trials (18–26 weeks of treatment). Furthermore, 
Fiasp has been studied in 777 paediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes in a randomised efficacy and 
safety trial (26 weeks of treatment). No children below the age of 2 years were randomised in the trial. 
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
The treatment effect of Fiasp in achieving glycaemic control was assessed when administered at 
mealtime or postmeal. Fiasp administered at mealtime was non-inferior to NovoRapid in reducing 
HbA1c, and the improvement in HbA1c was statistically significant in favour of Fiasp. Fiasp 
administered postmeal achieved similar HbA1c reduction as NovoRapid dosed at mealtime (Table 3).

E Statistically significant in favour of Fiasp mealtime 
33.3% of patients treated with mealtime Fiasp reached a target HbA1c of < 7% compared to 23.3% of 
patients treated with postmeal Fiasp and 28.2% of patients treated with mealtime NovoRapid. The 
estimated odds of achieving HbA1c < 7% were statistically significantly greater with mealtime Fiasp 
than with mealtime NovoRapid (odds ratio: 1.47 [1.02; 2.13]95% CI). No statistical significant difference 
was shown between postmeal Fiasp and mealtime NovoRapid.  
Fiasp administered at mealtime provided significantly lower 1-hour and 2-hour postmeal glucose 
increment compared to NovoRapid administrated at mealtime. Fiasp administered postmeal resulted in 
higher 1-hour postmeal glucose increment and comparable 2-hour postmeal glucose increment to 
NovoRapid dosed at mealtime (Table 3). 
Median total bolus insulin dose at trial end was similar for mealtime Fiasp, postmeal Fiasp and 
mealtime NovoRapid (change from baseline to end of trial: mealtime Fiasp: 0.33→0.39 units/kg/day; 
postmeal Fiasp: 0.35→0.39 units/kg/day; and mealtime NovoRapid: 0.36→0.38 units/kg/day). 
Changes in median total basal insulin dose from baseline to end of trial were comparable for mealtime 
Fiasp (0.41→0.39 units/kg/day), postmeal Fiasp (0.43→0.42 units/kg/day) and mealtime NovoRapid 
(0.43→0.43 units/kg/day). 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
The reduction in HbA1c from baseline to end of trial was confirmed to be non-inferior to that obtained 
with NovoRapid (Table 4).

C Statistically significant in favour of Fiasp 
Postmeal dosing has not been investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
74.8% of patients treated with Fiasp reached a target HbA1c of < 7% compared to 75.9% of patients 
treated with NovoRapid. There was no statistical significant difference between Fiasp and NovoRapid 
in the estimated odds of achieving HbA1c < 7%. 
Median total bolus insulin dose at trial end was similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid (change from 
baseline to end of trial: Fiasp: 0.21→0.49 units/kg/day and NovoRapid: 0.21→0.51 units/kg/day). 
Changes in median total basal insulin dose from baseline to end of trial were comparable for Fiasp 
(0.56→0.53 units/kg/day) and NovoRapid (0.52→0.48 units/kg/day). 
Elderly 
In the three controlled clinical trials, 192 of 1,219 (16%) Fiasp treated patients with type 1 diabetes or 
type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age and 24 of 1,219 (2%) were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall 
differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients. 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)  
A 6-week, randomised (2:1), double-blind, parallel-group, active controlled trial evaluated 
compatibility of Fiasp and NovoRapid administered via CSII system in adult patients with type 1 
diabetes. There were no microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions in either the 
Fiasp (N=25) or NovoRapid (N=12) groups. There were two patients from the Fiasp group who each 
reported two treatment-emergent infusion site reactions. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a 2-week cross-over trial, Fiasp showed a greater postmeal glucose-lowering effect after a 
standardised meal test with regard to 1-hour and 2-hour postmeal glucose response (treatment 
difference: -0.50 mmol/L [-1.07; 0.07]95% CI and -0.99 mmol/L [-1.95; -0.03]95% CI), respectively 
compared to NovoRapid in a CSII setting. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of Fiasp have been studied in a 1:1:1 randomised active controlled clinical trial 
in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, aged 1 to 18 years, for a period of 26 weeks (N=777). 
In this trial the efficacy and safety of Fiasp administered at mealtime (0–2 minutes before meal) or 
postmeal (20 minutes after meal start) and NovoRapid administered at mealtime, both used in 
combination with insulin degludec, were compared. 
Patients in the Fiasp mealtime arm included 16 children aged 2–5 years, 100 children aged 6–11 years 
and 144 adolescents aged 12–17 years. Patients in the Fiasp postmeal arm included 16 children aged 
2–5 years, 100 children aged 6–11 years and 143 adolescents aged 12–17 years. 
Fiasp administered at mealtime showed superior glycaemic control compared to NovoRapid mealtime 
with regards to change in HbA1c (ETD: -0.17% [-0.30; -0.03]95% CI). Fiasp administered postmeal 
showed non-inferior glycaemic control compared to NovoRapid mealtime (ETD: 0.13% [-0.01; 
0.26]95% CI). 
Fiasp mealtime showed a statistically significant improvement in 1– hour postmeal glucose increment 
mean over all three main meals compared to NovoRapid (measured by SMPG). For Fiasp postmeal 
this comparison favoured NovoRapid mealtime.  
No overall increased risk of severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia was observed 
compared to NovoRapid. 
The observed effects and the safety profiles were comparable between all age groups. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin aspart formulation in which the addition of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) 
results in a faster initial absorption of insulin. Insulin appeared in the circulation approximately 
4 minutes after administration (Figure 1). The onset of appearance was twice as fast (corresponding to 
5 minutes earlier), time to 50% maximum concentration was 9 minutes shorter with Fiasp compared to 
NovoRapid with four times as much insulin available during first 15 minutes and with twice as much 
insulin available during the first 30 minutes.

Figure 1 Mean insulin profile in patients with type 1 diabetes after subcutaneous injection. 
The total insulin exposure was comparable between Fiasp and NovoRapid. The mean Cmax for a dose 
of 0.2 units/kg body weight is 298 pmol/L and comparable to NovoRapid. 
Total exposure and maximum insulin concentration increases proportionally with increasing 
subcutaneous dose of Fiasp within the therapeutic dose range. 
The absolute bioavailability of insulin aspart after subcutaneous administration of Fiasp in the 
abdomen, deltoid and thigh was approximately 80%. 
After administration of Fiasp, the fast onset of appearance is maintained regardless of injection site. 
Time to maximum concentration and total insulin aspart exposure were all comparable between the 
abdomen, upper arm and the thigh. Early insulin exposure and maximum concentration were 
comparable for the abdomen and upper arm regions, but lower for the thigh. 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) 
The onset of exposure in a CSII setting (time to reach maximum concentration) was 26 minutes 
shorter with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid resulting in approximately three times as much insulin 
available during the first 30 minutes (Figure 2).

Time since bolus injection (min) 
Distribution 
Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (< 10%), similar to that seen with regular 
human insulin. 
Volume of distribution (Vd) after intravenous administration was 0.22 L/kg (e.g., 15.4 L for a 70 kg 
subject) corresponding to the extracellular fluid volume in the body. 
Biotransformation 
Degradation of insulin aspart is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are inactive. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Half-life after subcutaneous administration of Fiasp is 57 minutes and comparable to NovoRapid. 
Following intravenous administration of Fiasp, clearance was rapid (1 L/h/kg) and the elimination 
half-life was 10 minutes. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In elderly patients with type 1 diabetes Fiasp showed, an earlier onset of exposure and a higher early 
insulin exposure whilst maintaining a similar total exposure and maximum concentration compared to 
NovoRapid. 
Total insulin aspart exposure and maximum concentration following administration of Fiasp was 30% 
higher in elderly subjects compared to younger adult subjects.  
Gender  
The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of Fiasp was examined in an across-trial analysis of the 
pharmacokinetic trials. Fiasp showed a comparable earlier onset of exposure and a higher early insulin 
exposure whilst maintaining a similar total exposure and maximum concentration compared to 
NovoRapid for both females and male patients with type 1 diabetes. 
The early and maximum insulin exposure of Fiasp was comparable for female and male patients with 
type 1 diabetes. However, total insulin exposure was larger in female compared to male patients with 
type 1 diabetes. 
Obesity  
The initial absorption rate was slower with increasing BMI while the total exposure was similar across 
different BMI levels. Compared to NovoRapid, the influence of BMI on the absorption was less 
pronounced for Fiasp leading to relatively higher initial exposure. 
Race and ethnicity 
The effect of race and ethnicity (Blacks vs. Whites and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics) on the total 
insulin exposure of Fiasp was based on results from a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 
with type 1 diabetes. For Fiasp no difference in exposure was found between the racial and ethnic 
groups investigated. 
Hepatic impairment 
A single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart was performed with NovoRapid in 24 subjects 
with hepatic function ranging from normal to severely impaired. In subjects with hepatic impairment, 
absorption rate was decreased and more variable. 
Renal impairment 
A single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart was performed with NovoRapid in 18 subjects 
with renal function ranging from normal to severely impaired. No apparent effect of creatinine 
clearance values on AUC, Cmax, CL/F and Tmax of insulin aspart was found. Data were limited in 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. Patients with renal failure necessitating dialysis 
treatment were not investigated. 
Paediatric population 
In children (6–11 years) and adolescents (12–18 years) Fiasp showed, an earlier onset of exposure and 
a higher early insulin exposure whilst maintaining a similar total exposure and maximum 
concentration compared to NovoRapid. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Onset and early insulin exposure of Fiasp was similar in children and adolescents to that in adults. 
Total exposure of Fiasp was lower in children and adolescents compared to adults when dosed with 
0.2 units/kg body weight, while the maximum serum insulin aspart concentration was similar between 
age groups. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction after exposure to 
insulin aspart. In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell 
growth, insulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also 
demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to 
human insulin.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fiasp is and what it is used for 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for 
injection containing insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough 
insulin to control the level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from 
your diabetes. 
Fiasp should be injected up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to inject up to 
20 minutes after starting the meal. 
This medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 
3 to 5 hours.  
This medicine should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin 
preparations. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Fiasp 
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster 
compared to other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier 
after an injection with Fiasp.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’.  
Switching from other insulin medicinal products - Your doctor may need to advise you on your 
insulin dose.  
If your insulin treatment is being combined with pioglitazone (oral antidiabetic medicine used to 
treat type 2 diabetes) - Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get signs of heart failure such 
• 
• 
• 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling caused by fluid 
retention (oedema). 
Eye disorder - Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder such as diabetic retinopathy.  
Pain due to nerve damage - If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve 
related pain, this is usually temporary. 
Swelling around your joints - When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep 
more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is 
usually only short-lasting. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between insulin products. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substance that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’.  
Some conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: 
• 
• 
if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
When using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is 
recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’). Tell your doctor if 
you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents  
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  
Other medicines and Fiasp 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change.  
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
• 
sulphonamide antibiotics, (used to treat infections)  
• 
anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
• 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure or angina) 
• 
salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)  
• 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
• 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for some heart problems or high blood 
• 
pressure)  
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  
• 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation)  
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  
thyroid hormones (for thyroid problems)  
growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency)  
glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ for inflammation)  
sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline for asthma)  
thiazides (for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention))  
Octreotide and lanreotide - used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  
Fiasp with alcohol  
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. The amount of insulin you need 
usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. Careful 
control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is 
particularly important for the health of your baby. After you have had your baby your insulin 
requirements will likely return to how much you needed before your pregnancy. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines  
Having low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood 
sugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to 
yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  
• 
• 
you often get low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Fiasp 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen 
without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch pre-filled 
pen.  
The pre-filled pen can provide a dose of 1–80 units in one injection in steps of 1 unit.  
When to use Fiasp 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin.  
Adults: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to 
inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the possibility 
to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about how the 
child will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. 
This medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 
3 to 5 hours.  
Fiasp dose 
Dose for type 1 and type 2 diabetes  
Your doctor will decide together with you:  
• 
• 
how much Fiasp you will need at each meal 
when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose.  
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in 
diet may alter your need for insulin.  
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  
Dose adjustment for type 2 diabetes 
The daily dose should be based on your blood sugar level at mealtimes and bedtime from the previous 
day. 
• 
Before breakfast - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before lunch the 
previous day. 
Before lunch - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before dinner the 
previous day. 
Before dinner - dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime blood sugar level the previous 
day.

Use in elderly patients (65 years or older)  
This medicine can be used in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose.  
If you have kidney or liver problems  
If you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose.  
Injecting Fiasp 
This medicine is only suitable for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection).  
Before you use Fiasp for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled 
pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Where to inject 
• 
• 
• 
The best places to inject are the front of your waist (abdomen) or upper arms. 
Do not inject into a vein or muscle.  
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
changes under the skin (see section 4).  
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
• 
if the pen is damaged or if it has not been stored correctly (see section 5 ‘How to store Fiasp’).  
if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed instructions on how to use your FlexTouch pen are provided on the other side of this leaflet.  
If you use more Fiasp than you should  
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 
4 under ‘Low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Fiasp 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
Three simple steps that may help to avoid low or high blood sugar are:  
Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your pen or it gets damaged. 
• 
Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  
• 
Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under ‘What to do if you get 
• 
low blood sugar’. 
If you stop using Fiasp 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too 
much acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See 
advice in ‘Low blood sugar’ below. 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic shock) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Fiasp (how often this occurs is not known), stop using this medicine and contact 
emergency medical service straight away. 
Signs of a serious allergic reaction may include:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  
you start being sick (vomiting)  
you experience difficulty in breathing  
you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy.  
Allergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon 
and may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement 
in a few weeks. 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (these are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in 100 
people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous 
amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject 
into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes.  
Other side effects include: 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
Reaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs 
may include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually 
disappear after a few days. 
Skin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may 
occur. 
General effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) 
• 
Low blood sugar may happen if you:  
Drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  
Warning signs of low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly:  
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat; cool pale skin, feeling sick; feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused; 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight.  
What to do if you get low blood sugar  
• 
If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15–20 g of fast-acting 
carbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits 
(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case).  
It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15–20 minutes and re-treat if 
your blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. 
Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. 
Then carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  
Let them know that if you pass out, they must:  
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side to avoid choking 
get medical help straight away  
not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it.  
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or 
long-lasting. It may even cause death. 
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  
you have been given an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  
Talk to your doctor if:  
• 
• 
• 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)  
• 
High blood sugar may happen if you:  
Eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually:  
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Flushed skin; dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth; fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more 
often; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite; feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting).  
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death.  
What to do if you get high blood sugar  
Test your blood sugar level.  
• 
Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. 
• 
Test your urine for ketones.  
• 
If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  
• 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

Check the name and strength on the label of your pen, to make sure that it contains Fiasp 
100 units/mL. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take 
a wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
Pull off the pen cap. 
Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. 
Look through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen.

Make sure to attach the needle correctly. 
Push the needle straight onto the pen.  
Turn until it is on tight. 
• 
• 
  D 
The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove both caps. If you forget to remove both caps, 
you will not inject any insulin. 
• 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection, to 
safely remove the needle from the pen. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  E 
• 
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may 
accidentally prick or injure yourself with the needle. 
A drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the insulin 
flow. 
Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready for your injection. 
  F 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. 
This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate 
dosing. 
  Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
2 Check the insulin flow 
Always check the insulin flow before you start. 
This helps you to ensure that you get your full insulin dose. 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. Make sure the dose counter shows 2. 
• 
• 
  A 
2 units 
selected 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. 
• 
  B 
• 
Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  C 
A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. 
If no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle 
and repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. 
  Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure 
that the insulin is flowing properly. 
If no drop appears, no insulin will be injected, even though the dose counter may move. This 
may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
  Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to high blood sugar level. 
3 Select your dose 
Make sure the dose counter shows 0 before you start. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need, as directed by your doctor or nurse. 
If you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards to the correct 
dose. 
The pen can dial up to a maximum of 80 units. 
• 
• 
  A 
Examples 
5 units 
selected 
24 units 
selected 
The dose selector changes the number of units. Only the dose counter and dose pointer will 
show how many units you select per dose. 
You can select up to 80 units per dose. When your pen contains less than 80 units, the dose 
counter stops at the number of units left. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected 
before injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks to set the dose. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood 
sugar level may get too high or too low.  
Do not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
The dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of 
units left. 
4 Inject your dose 
• 
• 
  A 
• 
• 
  B 
• 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. 
Do not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection. 
Press and hold down the dose button. Watch as the dose counter returns to 0. The 0 must 
line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a click. 
Continue pressing the dose button while keeping the needle in your skin. 
Count slowly to 6 while keeping the dose button pressed. 
If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of insulin coming from the needle tip. If 
so, the full dose will not be delivered, and you should increase the frequency of checking your 
blood sugar level. 
  C  Count slowly: 
• 
Remove the needle from your skin. You can then release the dose button 
If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly on the skin for a few minutes to stop the 
bleeding. Do not rub the area. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  D 
You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect 
your dose. 
  Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. Hold the dose button 
down until the dose counter shows 0. If the dose counter does not return to 0, the full dose has 
not been delivered, which may lead to high blood sugar level.  
How to identify a blocked or damaged needle?  
• 
If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, you may 
have used a blocked or damaged needle.  
In this case - you have not received any medicine - even though the dose counter has moved 
from the original dose that you have set.  
• 
How to handle a blocked needle? 
Remove the needle as described in section 5 and repeat all steps starting with section 1: Prepare your 
pen with a new needle. Make sure you select the full dose you need.  
Never touch the dose counter when you inject.  
This can interrupt the injection. 
5 After your injection 
Always dispose of the needle after each injection  
This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate 
dosing. If the needle is blocked, you will not inject any insulin. 
Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without touching the needle or 
the outer cap. 
• 
  A 
• 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on. 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it as instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
• 
authorities. 
  B 
• 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the insulin from light. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  C 
When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, 
pharmacist or local authorities. 
  Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may prick or injure yourself 
with the needle. 
  Always remove the needle from your pen after each injection and store your pen without the 
needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked 
needles and inaccurate dosing. 
6 How much insulin is left? 
• 
The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
  A 
Approx. 
how much 
insulin is 
left 
To see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: 
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. 
If it shows 80, at least 80 units are left in your pen. 
If it shows less than 80, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. 
• 
  B 
Example 
Dose 
counter 
stopped: 
16 units 
left 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. 
If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two 
pens. 
  Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. 
If in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too 
little or too much insulin, which can lead to high or low blood sugar levels. 
Further important information 
Always keep your pen with you. 
Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you, in case of loss or damage.

Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to them. 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle 
injury and cross-infection. 
Caring for your pen 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can 
lead to high or low blood sugar levels. 
Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. 
Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. 
Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a 
moistened cloth. 
Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. 
If you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the insulin flow before you 
inject. 
Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. 
Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fiasp is and what it is used for 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for 
injection containing insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough 
insulin to control the level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from 
your diabetes.  
Fiasp should be injected up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to inject up to 
20 minutes after starting the meal. 
This medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 
3 to 5 hours. 
This medicine should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin 
preparations. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Fiasp 
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster 
compared to other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier 
after an injection with Fiasp.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’.  
Switching from other insulin medicinal products – Your doctor may need to advise you on your 
insulin dose  
If your insulin treatment is being combined with pioglitazone (oral antidiabetic medicine used to 
treat type 2 diabetes) - Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get signs of heart failure such 
• 
• 
• 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling caused by fluid 
retention (oedema). 
Eye disorder - Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder such as diabetic retinopathy.  
Pain due to nerve damage - If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve 
related pain, this is usually temporary. 
Swelling around your joints - When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep 
more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is 
usually only short-lasting. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between insulin products. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substance that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’.  
Some conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: 
• 
• 
if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
When using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is 
recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’). Tell your doctor if 
you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents  
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  
Other medicines and Fiasp 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change.  
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
• 
sulphonamides antibiotics (used to treat infections)  
• 
anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
• 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure or angina) 
• 
salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)  
• 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
• 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for some heart problems or high blood 
• 
pressure)  
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  
• 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation)  
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  
thyroid hormones (for thyroid problems) 
growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency)  
glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ - for inflammation)  
sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline - for asthma)  
thiazides (for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention)).  
Octreotide and lanreotide - used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  
Fiasp with alcohol  
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. The amount of insulin you need 
usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. Careful 
control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is 
particularly important for the health of your baby. After you have had your baby your insulin 
requirements will likely return to how much you needed before your pregnancy. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines  
Having low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood 
sugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to 
yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  
• 
• 
you often get low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that  is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Fiasp 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this 
insulin medicinal product without any help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained 
to use the pen.  
When to use Fiasp 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin.  
Adults: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to 
inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. 
Children: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the possibility 
to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about how the 
child will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 
3 to 5 hours.  
Fiasp dose 
Dose for type 1 and type 2 diabetes  
Your doctor will decide together with you:  
• 
• 
how much Fiasp you will need at each meal 
when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose.  
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in 
diet may alter your need for insulin.  
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  
Dose adjustment for type 2 diabetes 
The daily dose should be based on your blood sugar level at mealtimes and bedtime from the previous 
day. 
• 
Before breakfast - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before lunch the 
previous day. 
Before lunch - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before dinner the 
previous day. 
Before dinner - dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime blood sugar level the previous 
day.

If you have kidney or liver problems  
If you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose.  
Injecting Fiasp 
This medicine is only suitable for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) from a Novo 
Nordisk reusable insulin pen. 
Before you use Fiasp for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Where to inject  
• 
• 
• 
The best places to inject are the front of your waist (abdomen) or upper arms. 
Do not inject into a vein or muscle.  
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
changes under the skin (see section 4).  
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
if the cartridge or the reusable pen you are using is damaged. Take it back to your supplier. See 
your reusable pen manual for further instructions. 
if the cartridge has not been stored correctly (see section 5 ‘How to store Fiasp’). 
if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  
• 
• 
How to inject Fiasp 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Read the manual that comes with your reusable pen. 
Check the name and strength on the label of the cartridge (Penfill) to make sure it is Fiasp. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
Needles must not be shared. 
If you use more Fiasp than you should  
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 
4 under ‘Low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Fiasp 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
Three simple steps that may to help avoid low or high blood sugar are:  
• 
• 
• 
Always keep spare cartridges of Fiasp.  
Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  
Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under ‘What to do if you get 
low blood sugar’. 
If you stop using Fiasp 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too 
much acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See 
advice in ‘Low blood sugar’ below. 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic shock) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Fiasp (how often this occurs is not known), stop using this medicine and contact 
emergency medical service straight away.  
Signs of a serious allergic reaction may include:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  
you start being sick (vomiting)  
you experience difficulty in breathing  
you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy.  
Allergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon 
and may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement 
in a few weeks. 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (these are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in 100 
people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous 
amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject 
into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes.  
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other side effects include:  
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
Reaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs 
may include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually 
disappear after a few days. 
Skin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may 
occur. 
General effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) 
• 
Low blood sugar may happen if you:  
Drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  
Warning signs of low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly:  
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat; cool pale skin; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused; 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight.  
What to do if you get low blood sugar  
• 
If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15–20 g of fast-acting 
carbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits 
(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case).  
It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15–20 minutes and re-treat if 
your blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. 
Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. 
Then carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  
Let them know that if you pass out, they must:  
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side to avoid choking 
get medical help straight away  
not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it.  
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or 
long-lasting. It may even cause death.  
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  
you have been given an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  
Talk to your doctor if:  
• 
• 
• 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)  
• 
High blood sugar may happen if you:  
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin.  
Warning signs of high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually:  
Flushed skin; dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth; fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more 
often; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite;feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death.  
What to do if you get high blood sugar  
Test your blood sugar level.  
• 
Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. 
• 
Test your urine for ketones.  
• 
If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  
•

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fiasp is and what it is used for 
Fiasp is a mealtime insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for 
injection containing insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough 
insulin to control the level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from 
your diabetes.  
Fiasp should be injected up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to inject up to 
20 minutes after starting the meal. 
This medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 
3 to 5 hours. 
This medicine should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin 
preparations. 
This medicine can also be used for continuous infusion in a pump system. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Fiasp 
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster 
compared to other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier 
after an injection with Fiasp.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’.  
Switching from other insulin medicinal products – Your doctor may need to advise you on your 
insulin dose  
• 
• 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with pioglitazone (oral antidiabetic medicine used to 
treat type 2 diabetes) - Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get signs of heart failure such 
as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling caused by fluid 
retention (oedema). 
Eye disorder - Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder such as diabetic retinopathy. 
Pain due to nerve damage - If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve 
related pain, this is usually temporary. 
Swelling around your joints - When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep 
more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is 
usually only short-lasting. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between insulin products. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substance that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Some conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: 
• 
• 
if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
When using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is 
recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’). Tell your doctor if 
you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents  
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Fiasp 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change.  
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
• 
sulphonamides antibiotics (used to treat infections)  
• 
anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
• 
beta-blockers (used to treat  high blood pressure or angina) 
• 
salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)  
• 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
• 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for some heart problems or high blood 
• 
pressure)  
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  
• 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation)  
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  
thyroid hormones (for thyroid problems)  
growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency)  
glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ - for inflammation)  
sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline - for asthma)  
thiazides (for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention)).  
Octreotide and lanreotide - used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  
Fiasp with alcohol  
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. The amount of insulin you need 
usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. Careful 
control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is 
particularly important for the health of your baby. After you have had your baby your insulin 
requirements will likely return to how much you needed before your pregnancy. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines  
Having low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood 
sugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to 
yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  
• 
• 
you often get low blood sugar  
you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar.  
Important information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

Dose for type 1 and type 2 diabetes  
Your doctor will decide together with you:  
• 
• 
how much Fiasp you will need at each meal 
when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose.  
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in 
diet may alter your need for insulin.  
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  
Dose adjustment for type 2 diabetes 
The daily dose should be based on your blood sugar level at mealtimes and bedtime from the previous 
day. 
• 
Before breakfast - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before lunch the 
previous day. 
Before lunch - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before dinner the 
previous day. 
Before dinner - dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime blood sugar level the previous 
day.

If you have kidney or liver problems  
If you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose.  
Injecting Fiasp 
This medicine is for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) or for continuous infusion in 
pumps. Administration in a pump will require a comprehensive instruction by your healthcare 
professional.  
Where to inject  
• 
• 
• 
The best places to inject are the front of your waist (abdomen) or upper arms. 
Do not inject into a vein or muscle.  
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
changes under the skin (see section 4).  
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
if the protective cap on the vial is loose or missing. The vial contains a protective plastic cap in 
order to obtain a tamper-proof container. If the vial is not in perfect condition when you get it, 
return the vial to your supplier. 
if the vial has not been stored correctly (see section 5 ‘How to store Fiasp’).  
if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  
• 
• 
How to inject Fiasp 
Before you use Fiasp for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it.  
Check the name and strength on the label of the vial to make sure it is Fiasp.

Always use a new needle and syringe for each injection to prevent contamination. Needles and 
syringes must not be shared. 
Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. 
Inject the air into the vial. 
Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull 
the needle out of the vial. Push the air out of the syringe and check that the dose is correct. 
Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse. 
Throw away the needle after each injection. 
For use in an infusion pump system  
Follow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of Fiasp in a pump. 
Before using Fiasp in the pump system, you must have received a comprehensive instruction in the use 
and information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, high or low blood sugar or failure of 
the pump system. If you use Fiasp from a vial in an infusion pump system it can be used for a 
maximum of 6 days. 
Filling the pump 
• 
• 
Fiasp should never be diluted or mixed with any other insulin.  
Before inserting the needle, use soap and water to clean your hands and the skin where the 
needle is inserted to avoid any infection at the infusion site.  
When you fill a new reservoir, do not leave large air bubbles in either the syringe or the tubing.  
Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set.  
• 
• 
To get the benefit of insulin infusion and to detect possible malfunction of the insulin pump, it is 
recommended that you measure your blood sugar level regularly.  
What to do if the pump system fails  
You should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under 
the skin (for example, a pen injector or syringes) in case the pump system fails. 
If you use more Fiasp than you should  
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 
4 under ‘Low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Fiasp 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
Three simple steps that may help to avoid low or high blood sugar are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Fiasp. 
Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  
Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under ‘What to do if you get 
low blood sugar’. 
If you stop using Fiasp 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too 
much acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See 
advice in ‘Low blood sugar’ below.  
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic shock) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Fiasp (how often this occurs is not known), stop using this medicine and contact 
emergency medical service straight away.  
Signs of a serious allergic reaction may include:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  
you start being sick (vomiting)  
you experience difficulty in breathing  
you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy.  
Allergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon 
and may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement 
in a few weeks. 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (these are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in 100 
people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous 
amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject 
into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes.  
Other side effects include:  
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
Reaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs 
may include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually 
disappear after a few days.  
Skin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may 
occur.  
General effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) 
• 
Low blood sugar may happen if you:  
Drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  
Warning signs of low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly:  
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat; cool pale skin; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused; 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight.  
What to do if you get low blood sugar  
• 
If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15–20 g of fast-acting 
carbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits 
(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case).  
It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15–20 minutes and re–treat if 
your blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. 
Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. 
Then carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  
• 
• 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  
Let them know that if you pass out, they must:  
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side to avoid choking 
get medical help straight away  
not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it.  
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or 
long-lasting. It may even cause death.  
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  
you have been given an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  
Talk to your doctor if:  
• 
• 
• 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) High blood sugar may happen if you:  
• 
Eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin.  
Warning signs of high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually:  
Flushed skin; dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth; fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more 
often; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite; feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting).  
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death.  
What to do if you get high blood sugar  
Test your blood sugar level.  
• 
Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. 
• 
Test your urine for ketones.  
• 
If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  
•

About PumpCart 
The PumpCart cartridge is used in an insulin pump designed to be used with this cartridge: 
• 
It covers your total daily insulin needs – both your all-day (basal) and mealtime (bolus) insulin 
needs. 
Before you use a PumpCart cartridge in the pump, your doctor or nurse must have given you 
detailed instructions.  
• 
All-day (basal) insulin needs: 
When you use Fiasp in a pump, your insulin will be constantly delivered into your body. 
• 
• 
• 
This covers your need for insulin throughout the day. 
Before you set or change the all-day (basal) rate, carefully read the pump manual (user guide).  
If you stop the pump, be aware that the insulin effect will gradually decline over 3 to 5 hours 
Mealtime (bolus) insulin needs:

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) – If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster 
compared to other fast-acting insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier 
after an administration with Fiasp.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) – If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4 ‘Possible side effects’.  
Switching from other insulin medicinal products – Your doctor may need to advise you on your 
insulin dose  
If your insulin treatment is being combined with pioglitazone (oral antidiabetic medicine used to 
treat type 2 diabetes) - Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get signs of heart failure such 
as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling caused by fluid 
retention (oedema). 
Eye disorder – Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder such as diabetic retinopathy.  
Pain due to nerve damage – If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve 
related pain, this is usually temporary. 
Swelling around your joints – When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep 
more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is 
usually only short-lasting. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between insulin products. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substance that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose.

If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’.  
Some conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: 
• 
• 
if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
When using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is 
recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. 
Fiasp PumpCart is only for use with the following insulin infusion pump systems: the Accu-Chek 
Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps. It must not be used with other pumps, as this may give you a 
wrong dose of your insulin and can lead to high or low blood sugar.  
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Fiasp’). Tell your doctor if 
you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents  
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Fiasp 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level – this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change.  
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
• 
sulphonamides antibiotics (used to treat infections)  
• 
anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
• 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure or angina)  
• 
salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever  
• 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
• 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for some heart problems or high blood 
• 
pressure)  
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation)  
oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  
thyroid hormones (for thyroid problems) 
growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency)  
glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ – for inflammation)  
sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline – for asthma)  
thiazides (for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention)).  
Octreotide and lanreotide – used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  
Fiasp with alcohol  
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. The amount of insulin you need 
usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. Careful 
control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is 
particularly important for the health of your baby. After you have had your baby your insulin 
requirements will likely return to how much you needed before your pregnancy. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines  
Having low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood 
sugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to yourself 
or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  
• 
• 
you often get low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

How to use Fiasp 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the screen of the pump, do not use this pump 
without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pump.  
Dose and when to use Fiasp  
Always use your insulin and adjust your all-day (basal) and mealtime (bolus) doses exactly as your 
doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
• 
Adjust your mealtime (bolus) insulin based on your blood sugar measurement and food intake. 
Adults 
Fiasp mealtime doses should be taken right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to 
take up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. 
Children 
Fiasp mealtime doses should be taken right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the 
possibility to take up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about 
how the child will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. 
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in 
diet may alter your need for insulin.  
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  
Use in elderly patients (65 years or older)  
This medicine can be used in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose.  
If you have kidney or liver problems  
If you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose.  
Injecting Fiasp 
This medicine is only suitable for injection under the skin (subcutaneous). Only use a pump that is 
designed to be used with this cartridge.  
• 
Before you use the PumpCart cartridge in the pump, your doctor or nurse must have given you 
detailed instructions. 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
• 
Where to inject  
• 
Normally you will inject your insulin in the front of your waist (abdomen). However, if your 
doctor recommends it, you may use your upper arm.  
Do not inject into a vein or muscle. 
When you change the infusion set (tubing and needle), be sure to change where you insert the 
needle. This may reduce the risk of developing changes under the skin (see section 4 ‘Possible 
side effects’).  
Do not use Fiasp 
• 
if the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge you are using is dropped, damaged or 
crushed. Take it back to your supplier. 
if the cartridge has not been stored correctly (see section 5 ‘How to store Fiasp’). 
if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  
Detailed instructions on how to use your PumpCart are provided on the other side of this leaflet.  
How to inject Fiasp 
• 
• 
Read and follow the pump manual (user guide) that comes with your insulin pump. 
Make sure to use an infusion set (tubing and needle) suitable for your insulin pump. 
89 
• 
• 
• 
• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Check the name and strength on the label of the cartridge (PumpCart) to make sure it is Fiasp. 
Infusion set (tubing and needle) and the PumpCart cartridge must not be shared. 
Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set. 
What to do if the pump system fails  
You should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under 
the skin (for example, a pen injector or syringes) in case the pump system fails. 
If you use more Fiasp than you should  
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 4 
under ‘Low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Fiasp 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
Three simple steps that may help to avoid low or high blood sugar are:  
• 
• 
• 
Always keep spare cartridges of Fiasp.  
Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  
Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under ‘What to do if you get 
low blood sugar’. 
If you stop using Fiasp 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too 
much acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 
under ‘High blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you have 
symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See advice 
in ‘Low blood sugar’ below. 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic shock) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Fiasp (how often this occurs is not known), stop using this medicine and contact 
emergency medical service straight away.  
Signs of a serious allergic reaction may include:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  
you start being sick (vomiting)  
you experience difficulty breathing  
you experience rapid heartbeat or feel dizzy.  
Allergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon 
and may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement 
in a few weeks. 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (these are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in 100 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous 
amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject 
into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes.  
Other side effects include:  
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
Reaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs 
may include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually 
disappear after a few days. 
Skin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may 
occur. 
General effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) 
• 
Low blood sugar may happen if you:  
Drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  
Warning signs of low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly:  
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat; cool pale skin; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused; 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight.  
What to do if you get low blood sugar  
• 
If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15–20 g of fast-acting 
carbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits 
(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case) and adjust insulin delivery or 
stop your pump.  
It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15–20 minutes and re-treat if 
your blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. 
Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. 
Then carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  
Let them know that if you pass out, they must:  
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side to avoid choking 
get medical help straight away  
not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it.  
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or 
long-lasting. It may even cause death.  
Talk to your doctor if:  
• 
• 
• 
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  
you have been given an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)  
• 
High blood sugar may happen if you:  
Eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin.  
Warning signs of high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually:  
Flushed skin; dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth; fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more 
often; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite; feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death.  
What to do if you get high blood sugar  
Test your blood sugar level.  
• 
Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. 
• 
Test your urine for ketones.  
• 
If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  
•

effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

cartridge, such as the Accu-Chek Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps. 
• 
• 
Do not use with other devices not designed for the PumpCart cartridge. 
This is because it may result in incorrect insulin dosing and lead to high blood sugar 
(hyperglycaemia) or low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
Please read these instructions carefully before using your PumpCart cartridge.  
Please also read the pump manual (user guide) that comes with your insulin pump.  
The PumpCart cartridge is ready for use directly in the pump.  
The PumpCart cartridge contains 1.6 mL insulin aspart solution, equivalent to 160 units.  
Never mix with any other medicinal products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion. Pemetrexed Hospira 100 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg Powder for Concentrate for Solution for 
Infusion has the same active substance and the same excipients in comparable amounts to the 
centrally approved reference medicinal product Alimta (EU/1/04/290/001-002). After reconstitution, 
each vial contains 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. 
The claimed indication for Pemetrexed Hospira is: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Pemetrexed  Hospira  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  chemotherapy 
naïve patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Pemetrexed Hospira in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous 
cell histology. 
Pemetrexed Hospira is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients 
whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Pemetrexed Hospira is indicated as monotherapy for the second-line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
As monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin, the recommended dose of pemetrexed is 500 
mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the 
first day of each 21-day cycle. 
Pemetrexed Hospira must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to use. After reconstitution, each 
strength of the proposed product contains 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. 
About the product 
Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial 
folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
Mode of action 
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of 
thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate 
carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is

rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate 
synthetase.  
The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 
Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to 
a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular 
half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 
mg/vial, 500 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial of pemetrexed (as disodium salt hemipentahydrate) as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are mannitol, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.  
The product is available in clear, type I glass vials with rubber stoppers as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure.  
The chemical name of pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate is 
N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic 
acid disodium salt hemipentahydrate  and it has the following structure and properties: 
Molecular formula: C19H21N5Na2O6.[H2O]2.5   -   Relative molecular mass: 516.4 gmol-1 
The active substance is a white to off-white hygroscopic crystalline solid, freely soluble in water but 
practically insoluble in organic solvents. It has one chiral centre which originates in one of the starting 
materials and which is tested in the active substance by specific optical rotation and chiral HPLC. 
Two hydrate form of pemetrexed disodium are known. The heptahydrate has a Ph. Eur. monograph 
whilst the hemipentahydrate used in this product is routinely produced by the given manufacturing 
processes. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is sourced from one supplier using two manufacturing sites (one of them is 
Assessment report  
EMA/700366/2015 
Page 7/18 
 
  
  
 
 
involved in intermediate manufacture). 
Pemetrexed is synthesized in seven stages using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. Staring materials were re-defined during the procedure as a 
result of major objections, thus ensuring that steps critical to the quality of the active substance are 
controlled. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. Potentially genotoxic impurities were demonstrated not to 
be detected in the active substance and are thus not routinely tested for. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is packaged in a polyethylene bag, filled with nitrogen and heat sealed which 
complies with Ph. Eur. requirements and Commission Regulation No. 1183/2012. The polyethylene 
bag is then placed into a secondary polyethylene bag, which is also heat sealed. This bag is inserted 
into an aluminium foil bag and heat sealed. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC, UV, sodium test 
(USP), colour, clarity and pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), enantomeric purity (HPLC),  related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP), specific 
optical rotation (USP), chloride (USP), sulfate (USP), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and total aerobic 
microbial count (Ph. Eur.).   
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the 
reference standards has been provided. 
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of active substance were provided. The results 
were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance stored in packaging simulating 
the proposed commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5±3 ºC) and 6 
months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Samples were tested for appearance, identity, clarity and colour of solution, specific optical 
rotation and optical isomer, impurities, water content, bacterial endotoxins and microbial limits. In 
addition, supportive stability data was provided on additional seven batches of active substance for up 
to 24 months under long term conditions and on five additional batches, for up to 36 months at -20 ºC 
(a further long term condition). Forced degradation studies show the active substance is sensitive to 
oxidation. Active substance from this source has a re-test period of 24 months when stored at -20 ºC 
and 12 months when stored at 5±3 ºC in the original packaging.

2.2.1.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of development was to produce a finished product bioequivalent to the reference medicinal 
product Alimta which is a lyophilised powder containing only the active substance, mannitol, and pH 
adjusting agents HCl or NaOH. An additional 1 g/vial presentation was also developed to facilitate 
administration of Pemetrexed for Injection in patients exceeding a body surface area (BSA) of 1 m2. 
The active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, and reconstitution instructions are the 
same as that of the reference product Alimta marketed by Eli Lilly. The proposed finished product uses 
a different hydrate form to the reference medicinal product, but since it is fully solubilised during 
formulation, this has no impact. It is however more unstable and thus needs to be stored under 
controlled conditions. The excipients used are the same as for the reference medicinal product and are 
well known pharmaceutical ingredients whose quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in section 2.2.1 above. An over-fill of vials is used in order to ensure the 
claimed amount can be withdrawn from vials following reconstitution. The reconstitution method is 
adequately described in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
Since the finished product is administered as an aqueous intravenous solution in the same 
concentration as Alimta, the excipients are qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent, and the active 
substance is freely soluble in aqueous media, no bioequivalence study is required. 
The active substance is unstable to oxygen. Thus, all manufacture is carried out under a nitrogen 
atmosphere. In addition to purging, the pH is controlled during the compounding process and the 
formulation temperature is maintained below 25°C. 
Terminal sterilisation by heat or radiation was demonstrated to be unsuitable due to instability of the 
finished product. Thus, the finished product is manufactured by sterile filtration followed by aseptic 
processing. Lyophilisation development activities determined cycle parameters which allowed the 
frozen sample matrix to be satisfactorily freeze-dried below the critical temperature. 
The primary packaging is clear, colourless type I glass vials with bromobutyl rubber stoppers. The 
vials are sealed with aluminium crimp caps with a flip-off cap. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: compounding and pre-filtration; sterile 
filtration and filling; lyophilisation; stoppering and further packaging. The process is considered to be 
a non-standard manufacturing process. The in-process controls (pH, assay of solution during 
compounding, bioburden, filter integrity test during filtration, filter integrity test during nitrogen 
filtration and fill weight control during filling process) are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three production scale 
batches of each strength. Hold time study results support the proposed holding times. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description of cake, reconstitution time, description of solution, colour and pH of solution 
(Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), identification (UV, HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Assessment report

Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. 
Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards of 
active substance and impurities has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of 100 mg/vial presentation, three 
pilot scale batches of the 500 mg/vial strength, and three production scale batches of the 1000 
mg/vial presentation confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for  three pilot scale batches of the 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial strength  
stored under long term conditions for up to 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. Stability data were 
also provided for  three production scale batches of 1g/vial strength  stored under long term 
conditions for up to 6 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The batches are representative to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Vials were stored in 
both upright and inverted positions. Samples were tested according to the release specifications 
except for pH, related substances and water content (wider limits at shelf-life). Shelf-life limit were 
considered appropriate except for the shelf-life limit for total impurities. The applicant agreed to 
consider further tightening of the shelf-life limit for total impurities when stability study is completed. 
The analytical procedures used are the same as for release and are stability indicating.  
Stress studies were performed by storing the drug product under freezer conditions (-20°C±5°C) for 
1 month. Results showed that the freeze-thaw conditions had no impact on the stability of the drug 
product. 
Stress testing was also demonstrated during the method validation by degrading a reconstituted (25 
mg/mL) finished product sample. Portions of the reconstituted product were stressed with acid, base, 
heat, oxidation (H2O2) and light. The data demonstrated that the product is susceptible to 
degradation by harsh heat, oxidation, basic, acidic and light conditions. 
An extractable study was performed on the bromobutyl rubber closure. Results demonstrated 
compatibility of the closures for freeze-dried powders and aqueous solution. 
A reconstitution study was conducted using one batch of the 100 mg/vial, which when reconstituted 
with 0.9% Sodium Chloride has the same strength (25 mg/mL) as the 500 mg/vial and 1 g/vial 
presentations thus is also representative of the 500 mg/vial and 1 g/vial presentations. The key 
attributes that were monitored were pH, description of solution, assay, related substances and 
particulate matter. The results of the experiments demonstrated that the finished product when 
reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection is stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature 
(25°C exposed to normal room light) or refrigerated (5°C ± 3°C protected from light). Studies were 
performed to demonstrate compatibility with polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin lined infusion bags. 
Each study was performed at two concentrations 5 mg/mL and 14 mg/mL, to support the dosage 
range for patients with Body Surface Areas between 1.0 m2 and 2.7 m2. The results from both studies 
were acceptable and support the label claim regarding stability of the subject finished product when 
co-mixed with intravenous solutions as prescribed in the SmPC. The studies also demonstrated that 
the proposed finished product is comparable to the reference medicinal product when diluted in the 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection and stored for 24 hours at either room temperature or refrigerated 
conditions.

A transport study was performed in which the effects of temperature cycling were investigated to 
determine the effect of transportation on the stability of the proposed finished product. This study 
demonstrated that the proposed finished product is stable when subjected to freezing, thawing and 
temperatures of up to 40°C/75%RH during transportation over a 12 day period. All results obtained 
are within the proposed specification.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life is 3 years with no special storage condition. The 
shelf-life is acceptable and included in the SmPC. The following statement is also included in the SmPC 
“Chemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of Pemetrexed Hospira 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours after 
reconstitution of the original vial when stored below 25°C. From a microbiological point of view, the 
product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions 
prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C 
to 8°C.” 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Staring materials were re-defined during the procedure 
as a result of major objections, thus ensuring that steps critical to the quality of the active substance 
are controlled. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issues related to finished 
product shelf-life limit for total impurities that have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.3.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.4.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The shelf-life limit should be tightened for total impurities within the specifications of the medicinal 
product when the stability study is completed. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
Assessment report

profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.   
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Pemetrexed Hospira manufactured by Hospira is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all pemetrexed containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of pemetrexed are well known. No 
non-clinical data are submitted with this application. Published literature has been reviewed and is 
considered of suitable quality.  
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing pemetrexed.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of pemetrexed based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Exemption  
Pemetrexed Hospira has the same active substance, indications, route of administration, dosage form 
and posology as Alimta.  
Alimta is available in two presentations in the European market: 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial of 
pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium). 
The proposed presentations of Pemetrexed Hospira are: 100 mg/vial, 500 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial. 
The composition of Pemetrexed Hospira 100 mg and 500 mg vial and Alimta 100 mg and 500 mg vial 
are similar. A quantitative composition comparison of the applied and the reference product is 
provided below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/700366/2015 
Page 12/18 
 
  
  
 
The qualitative composition of the new presentation, 1000 mg/vial, is comparable to the composition 
of the 100 mg and 500 mg vials. 
Both products are intended for intravenous use and must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to 
use. After reconstitution each presentation of both the proposed product and the originator product 
contains 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. 
Biowaiver 
No bioequivalence studies have been submitted. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), 
bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the product is to be administered as an aqueous 
IV solution containing the same active drug substance in the same concentration as the currently 
authorised product. Pemetrexed solution is intended for IV use and contains the same active drug 
substance in a concentration (25 mg/mL) similar to the concentration of 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial 
presentations of Alimta and therefore, no bioequivalence studies are required. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pemetrexed Hospira, 100 mg and 500 mg, powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, has the 
same active substance and the same excipients in comparable amounts as the reference medicinal 
product, Alimta. Furthermore, Pemetrexed Hospira has the same indications, posology, 
pharmaceutical form, route of administration and strength after reconstitution as Alimta.

Although a new presentation of 1000 mg is introduced by the Applicant compared to the reference 
product, the application is still considered to be a generic application as the reconstituted product has 
the same concentration as the reference product regardless of the presentation. Therefore, the 
introduction of the 1000 mg presentation is considered acceptable. 
There are no concerns with Pemetrexed Hospira from a clinical efficacy point of view. 
No new studies have been conducted and none are required under the provisions of the Note for 
Guidance on the investigation of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev. 
1): “Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an 
aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved 
product”.   
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Pemetrexed Hospira and justifications that 
the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of 
the reference product was provided and is deemed acceptable and sufficiently up-to-date. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical/bioequivalence studies were not 
considered necessary. The CHMP considers that there are no objections to approval of Pemetrexed 
Hospira 100 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion from a clinical 
point of view. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.0 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment 
report.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and CHMP.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.0 with the following content:

Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
The 1000 mg strength does not exist for the reference originator Alimta. Therefore, PRAC and CHMP 
estimate that, even if not listed as a specific risk in the RMP of Pemetrexed Hospira, the risk of 
medication error should be under specific surveillance by the MAH. Should a significant increase in the 
frequency of reported medication errors be detected, the MAH should report this as a signal. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures. 
Risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication(s).

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The reference product Alimta is indicated for  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients 
with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose 
disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or

metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. However, the applicant 
provided a clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature 
which was considered sufficient. 
Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the 
Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1) since the product 
is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the 
same concentration as the currently authorised product 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product Alimta can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation

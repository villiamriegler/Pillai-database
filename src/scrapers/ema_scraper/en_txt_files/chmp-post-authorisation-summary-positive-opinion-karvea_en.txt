Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Karvea  
irbesartan 
On 27 June 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Karvea. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Sanofi-Aventis 
Groupe. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the 
European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new contraindication as follows: 
"Do not co-administer Karvea with aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with 
moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2).” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full contraindications for Karvea will be as follows2: 
"Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Do not co-administer Karvea with aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes 
or with moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 
ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).” 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

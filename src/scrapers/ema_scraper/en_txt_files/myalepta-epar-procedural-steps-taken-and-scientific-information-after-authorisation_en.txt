SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Myalepta in the approved indication remains favourable, 
but recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
There are three ongoing post-marketing studies (SOBs) 
which can provide additional information to better 
characterise the safety profile of metreleptin and have an 
impact on the benefit-risk balance of Myalepta. Therefore, 
a second renewal is required.

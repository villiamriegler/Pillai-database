Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for icosapent ethyl, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on pharyngeal swelling from the literature, including in 2 cases a close 
temporal relationship and a positive re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between 
icosapent ethyl and pharyngeal swelling is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the 
product information of products containing icosapent ethyl should be amended accordingly.
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for icosapent ethyl the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing icosapent ethyl is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

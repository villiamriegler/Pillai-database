Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ciltacabtagene autoleucel, the 
scientific conclusions of the PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on leak from bags of CARVYKTI after thawing from clinical trial(s) and 
spontaneous reports including in a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers that a causal 
relationship between ciltacabtagene autoleucel and product handling issues is at least a reasonable 
possibility. As well, even though further investigation is warranted in regards to the case of T-Cell 
Malignancy, the mention of such case has been considered acceptable as intermediary action in the 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
ciltacabtagene autoleucel should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ciltacabtagene autoleucel the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ciltacabtagene autoleucel is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Summary of the risk management plan for ELZONRIS (tagraxofusp) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ELZONRIS. The RMP details 
important risks of ELZONRIS, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about ELZONRIS's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ELZONRIS’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ELZONRIS should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for ELZONRIS should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
ELZONRIS's RMP. 
The medicine and what it is used for
I. 
ELZONRIS is authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with blastic 
plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) (see SmPC for the full indication). 
ELZONRIS is a diphtheria toxin- interleukin-3 (IL-3) fusion protein produced by 
recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. ELZONRIS is composed of the catalytic 
and transmembrane domains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin fused via a Met-His linker 
to IL-3 as the active substance and it is as an intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of ELZONRIS’s benefits can be found in 
ELZONRIS EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage. Elzonris EPAR. 
II.
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of ELZONRIS, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about ELZONRIS's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of ELZONRIS, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken 
as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ELZONRIS is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of ELZONRIS are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of ELZONRIS. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of important risks 
Table II.B. 1: Important identified risk - Capillary leak syndrome 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Overall 18% (32/176) of patients treated with ELZONRIS monotherapy at 
≤12 µg/kg/day experienced CLS, with a similar incidence among BPDCN patients 
(20% [18/89]). Most CLS events were Grade 2 in intensity. CLS was Grade 3 and 
Grade 4 in intensity for 6 and 2 patients, respectively. For 3 patients with BPDCN, 
CLS was Grade 5 (i.e., had a fatal outcome). Of the 27 patients for whom CLS was not 
fatal or did not lead to ELZONRIS discontinuation, only 1 patient experienced a 
recurrence of CLS when retreated with ELZONRIS. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Symptoms of CLS include hypoalbuminemia, weight increase, oedema and 
hypotension

Table II.B. 2: Important potential risk - Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) among BPDCN 
patients were liver transaminase elevations. 
Among BPDCN patients, 66% (59/89) experienced ALT increased and 53 (60%) 
experienced AST increased. For 30 patients, ALT increased and/or AST increased 
were Grade 3 in intensity; 2 Grade 4 cases were reported. Most cases of ALT increased 
and AST increased were transient, resolving within a cycle. Furthermore, most cases 
were non-serious, with 2 BPDCN patients experiencing serious ALT increased and/or 
AST increased. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients presenting with underlying elevated liver enzymes can be susceptible to further 
liver function abnormalities if not managed adequately.

Table II.B. 3: Important potential Risk - Choroid Plexus Lesions 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Inflammation and necrosis of epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus were observed 
across some animal studies, and particularly at high doses in studies MPI-2231-002 and 
MPI-2231-007. This observation was consistent with previous nonclinical toxicity studies 
preceding the first-in-human investigator-sponsored clinical trial. Importantly, there was 
no documented evidence suggestive of choroid plexitis on neuroimaging in any of the 
Nervous system disorder serious treatment related cases. Additionally, there were no 
serious nor severe adverse reactions suggestive of idiopathic raised intracranial pressures 
in the 176 patients who received ELZONRIS at ≤12 µg/kg/day. A toxicity biomarker 
related to ELZONRIS for the development of choroid plexus lesions has not been 
identified. Changes in the choroid plexus may be of relevance to humans. No 
neurological events occurred on study 0114 in BPDCN patients that are considered 
related to choroid plexus deposits.

Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 
Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
Short study name: Post-authorisation (safety and efficacy study conducted via a) Registry of 
ELZONRIS (tagraxofusp). 
Purpose of the study: A non-interventional category 2 PASS with study aims to assess the 
clinical outcomes (primarily the rate of Complete response after 3 months +/- 1 month) and 
incidence of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) in patients actively treated for BPDCN in routine 
practice compared to clinical studies. Secondary objectives will include: Rate bridge to stem cell 
transplant (SCT), Progression-free survival, Overall survival, Best Overall Response, Duration of 
Response, , Dose interruptions and/or the administration of intravenous albumin supplementation 
in patients presenting with a diagnosis or symptoms of CLS (i.e. hypoalbuminemia, oedema, 
weight gain and/or hypotension), Incidence and severity ofAdverse Events of Special Interest, 
Describe available safety data of tagaxofusp monotherapy in patients with significant 
cardiovascular history, hepatic impairment and/or renal impairment, and Evaluate number of 
doses/cycles administered. Choroid plexitis will be included as an adverse event of special 
interest. 
II.C.2  Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
Study short name: Immunohistochemistry staining of brain tissue samples from Study MPI 
2231 007. 
Purpose of the study: A category 3 post-authorisation non-clinical study on Blood Brain Barrier 
(BBB) models will be conducted in order to determine a potential toxicity biomarker to further 
investigate the risk of 'choroid plexus lesions'. As described in SVII.1.2, the risk and impact of 
choroid plexus lesions (including choroid plexitis) identified in non-clinical studies has not been 
fully characterized nor quantified. Although there were no serious cases of raised intracranial 
pressure with unaccounted etiology, cases where neuroimaging was performed may not have 
specifically included review of choroid plexus morphology/pathology. A nonclinical approach is 
proposed for a greater understanding of potential mechanisms of the choroid plexus findings 
from the tagraxofusp cynomologus monkey toxicology studies. This nonclinical study will 
explore the ability of tagraxofusp to cross the BBB as a means of investigating the development 
of choroid plexitis observed in some animals. Data obtained may provide insight into potential 
biomarkers of this toxicity or additional information on potential mechanisms. Until that time, 
all ICSRs will be collected as assessed in accordance with routine PV activities.

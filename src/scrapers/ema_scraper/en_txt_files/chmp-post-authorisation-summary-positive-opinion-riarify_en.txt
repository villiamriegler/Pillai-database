Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Riarify 
beclometasone dipropionate / formoterol fumarate dihydrate / glycopyrronium 
On 28 February 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Riarify. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2  
“Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a 
long-acting beta2-agonist or a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see 
section 5.1)”. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

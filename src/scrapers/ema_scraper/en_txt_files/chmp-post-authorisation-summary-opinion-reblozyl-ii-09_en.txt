Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Reblozyl 
luspatercept 
On 26 January 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Reblozyl. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication to include treatment of anaemia associated with 
non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassaemia. 
For information, the full indications will be as follows:2  
Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due 
to very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, 
who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy (see 
section 5.1). 
Reblozyl is indicated in adults for the treatment of anaemia associated with transfusion-
dependent and non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1).  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

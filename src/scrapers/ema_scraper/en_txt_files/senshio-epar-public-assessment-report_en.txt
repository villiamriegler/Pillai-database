2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Background on vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) 
Estrogen  deficiency  affects  numerous  tissues  in  postmenopausal  women,  including  musculoskeletal, 
vascular and urogenital systems (Archer, 2010).  
The  vaginal  wall  has  estrogen  receptors,  mainly  in  the  basal  layers  of  the  epithelium,  but  also  in 
stromal  cells  and  smooth  muscle  fibers.  Estrogen  affects  the  epithelium,  connective  tissue,  and 
vaginal  wall  elasticity.  Premenopausal  estrogen  concentrations  are  associated  with  a  thickened  and 
mature vaginal mucosa, with increased vaginal blood flow, lubrication, and mechanical sensitivity.  
Estrogen stimulation also helps produce glycogen in the vaginal epithelial cells, which is metabolized 
by  lactobacilli  to  produce  lactic  acid.  This  lactic  acid  maintains  an  acidic  environment  that  keeps 
vaginal pH levels low (normal range 3.5 to 4.5), which is part of the body’s natural defence against 
bacterial vaginal and urinary tract infections.  
The decline in estrogen in postmenopausal women results in a decrease in vaginal lubrication, which 
is  an  early  hallmark  of  VVA.  Other  symptoms  of  VVA  include  burning,  dyspareunia  (vaginal  pain 
associated  with  sexual  activity),  loss  of  vaginal  secretions,  leukorrhea,  vulvar  pruritus,  a  feeling  of 
pressure  and  bleeding  (particularly  associated  with  sexual  activity).  VVA  is  also  associated  with 
urinary  symptoms  including  urethral  discomfort,  frequency,  hematuria,  urinary  tract  infection, 
dysuria,  and  stress  incontinence  (MacBride  et.  al.,  2010).  Over  time  these  symptoms,  especially 
dyspareunia, can lead to female sexual dysfunction and subsequent emotional distress. 
Despite  the  impact  of  VVA  on  women’s  health,  this  condition  is  underdiagnosed  and  undertreated, 
with only an estimated 20-25% of symptomatic women seeking medical treatment (Archer, 2010).  
Treatment Options of VVA 
Treatment  goals  for  VVA  include  alleviating  symptoms,  reversing  or  minimizing  the  physiologic 
changes, and improving quality of life for the patient. There are: 
-  Non-hormonal  treatments:  A  number  of  over-the-counter  (OTC)  vaginal  moisturizer  and  lubricant 
products  are  considered  first-line  non-hormonal  treatments  for  vaginal  dryness.  This  option  can  be 
appropriate  for  women  concerned  about  hormone  use,  those  with  minimal  physiologic  changes  or 
symptoms, or those who are not candidates for estrogen treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 9/116 
 
  
  
- Hormonal treatments: Local, low-dose estrogen preparations to be applied vaginally are considered 
first-line  pharmacologic  treatment  (Royal  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynaecologists  Guideline 
Menopause and Hormone Replacement). The guideline further states: “There is no evidence that local 
vaginal oestrogen treatment is associated with significant risks”. These preparations include: Vagifem 
10  mg  (estradiol  tablets  for  vaginal  application),  Estring  (estradiol  in  vaginal  ring)  and  Synapause 
(estriol ovules for vaginal application).  
However,  for  older  women  with  VVA  who  prefer  oral  agents  to  vaginal  products,  that  no  longer 
complain  of  vasomotor  symptoms  or  who  wish  to  avoid  estrogen,  treatment  options  have  become 
limited (Bachmann et. al., 2010). For the indication of ‘vulvar and vaginal atrophy’ several estrogen-
containing  products  are  registered  in  Europe,  but  all  these  products  are  indicated  for  local  vaginal 
application.  Also,  due  to  labelling  changes  following  the  Women’s  Health  Initiative  2002  study, 
treatment  recommendations  on  systemic  estrogen  therapy  limit  its  use  to  the  lowest  effective  dose 
for  the  shortest  duration,  and  primarily  for  use  in  women  with  moderate  to  severe  vasomotor 
symptoms.  
The  development  of  an  effective  oral  non-estrogen  based  therapy  for  VVA  could  therefore  be  of 
benefit in these patients.  
About the product 
The indication claimed by the applicant at initial submission was: “Treatment of vulvar and vaginal 
atrophy (VVA) in post-menopausal women (see section 5.1).” 
This was revised to the current indication, which is: “Treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic 
vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy  (VVA)  in  post-menopausal  women  who  are  not  candidates  for  local 
vaginal oestrogen therapy (see section 5.1)”. 
The proposed posology is: “The recommended dose is one 60 mg tablet once daily with food taken at 
the same time each day.” 
The  claimed  mechanism  of  action,  as  stated  in 5.1 of  the  SmPC  is:  “Ospemifene’s  biological  actions 
are  mediated  through  the  binding  of  Ospemifene  and  its  major  metabolite  to  oestrogen  receptors. 
The  relative  contribution  of  the  metabolite  to  the  pharmacological  effect  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately  40%.  This  binding  results  in  activation  of  some  oestrogenic  pathways  (agonism)  and 
blockade  of  other  oestrogenic  pathways  (antagonism).  The  biological  activity  profile  in  humans  is 
predominantly due to the parent compound. 
Nonclinical findings show that Ospemifene and its major metabolite have an oestrogen like effect in 
the  vagina  increasing  the  cellular  maturation  and  mucification  of  the  vaginal  epithelium.  In  the 
mammary  gland,  they  have  a  predominantly  oestrogen  antagonist  effect.  In  bone,  Ospemifene  has 
agonist-like  activity.  In  the  uterus  Ospemifene  and  its  major  metabolite  have  weak  partial 
agonist/antagonist effects. These non-clinical findings are consistent with findings from clinical trials, 
in  which  Ospemifene  demonstrated  benefits  on  vaginal  physiology  without  apparent  oestrogen-like 
effects on breast tissue (see 5.1 Clinical safety).” 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Legal basis 
The  application  was  a  full,  stand-alone  application  in  accordance  with  Directive  2001/83/EC  Article 
8(3) as amended for the approval of a new active substance through the centralised procedure. 
Scientific Advice 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 10/116 
 
  
  
 
No  CHMP  scientific  advice  relating  to  the  Ospemifene  development  programme  has  been  received. 
However, several member states have given scientific advice prior to the submission of the marketing 
authorisation application. 
In  2012,  Germany  and  UK  gave  scientific  advice  prior  to  the  pre-submission  meetings  -  namely 
about  the  daily  dose  of  the  medicinal  product,  its  endometrial  safety  and  overall  safety  profile. 
During the meeting with BfArM (Germany), a specific concern was raised regarding the lack of active 
comparator in the pivotal studies conducted. The absence of comparison to standard therapy (local 
estrogens) was addressed in the assessment of this application. 
Development programme 
In  the  EU,  no  regulatory  guidance  had  been  developed  -  at  the  time  of  this  report  -  on  the 
investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy.  The  “Guideline  on  Clinical 
Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Hormone  Replacement  Therapy  of  Oestrogen  Deficiency 
Symptoms  in  Postmenopausal  Women”  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97)  does  not  specifically  address 
requirements for vaginal atrophy.  
The  requirements  as  laid  down  in  the  FDA  guidance  for  industry  “Estrogen  and  Estrogen/Progestin 
Drug  Products  to  Treat  Vasomotor  Symptoms  and  Vulvar  and  Vaginal  Atrophy  Symptoms  – 
Recommendations  for  Clinical  Evaluation”  have  been  previously  accepted  in  the  EU  during  the 
authorisation  of  other  products  for  vaginal  atrophy.  The  development  programme  for  Ospemifene 
followed the above mentioned FDA guidance. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 60 mg of 
ospemifene as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: pregelatinized starch, mannitol (E421), povidone (E1201), sodium starch 
glycolate Type A, microcrystalline cellulose (E460), colloidal silicon dioxide (E551), magnesium 
stearate (E578), hypromellose (E464), lactose monohydrate, titanium dioxide (E171), polyethylene 
glycol (E1521), and triacetin (E1518), as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in PVC/PVDC aluminium blisters, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of the active substance ospemifene is Z-2-[4-(4-chloro-1,2-diphenylbut-1-enyl) 
phenoxy]ethanol, corresponding to the molecular formula C24H23O2Cl and has a relative molecular 
mass of 378.9. It has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 11/116 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, 
infrared  spectroscopy,  1H-  and  13C-NMR  spectroscopy  and  X-ray,  all  of  which  support  the  chemical 
structure.  
Ospemifene appears as a white to almost white, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is insoluble in 
water,  soluble  in  ethanol and  propanol,  very  slightly  soluble  in  isopropanol.  The  partition  coefficient 
was found 4.43 and the pKa was calculated 14.26. 
The molecule has two geometrical isomeric forms. The active substance ospemifene is the Z-isomer. 
Polymorphism was not observed. 
Manufacture 
The information on the active substance was provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  in  four  chemical  synthetic  steps.  The  material  is  then  dried, 
micronised and packaged. The manufacture of the Z-isomer is achieved by appropriately selected and 
controlled reaction conditions. The proposed starting and raw materials used in the synthesis and the 
intermediates are well-defined and controlled by suitable methods and specifications.  The synthesis 
has been described in sufficient detail and critical process parameters, yields and in-process controls 
(IPCs)  have  been  reported  and  are  considered  satisfactory.  The  characterisation  of  the  active 
substance  and  its  impurities  is  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities (including genotoxic) and degradation products have been 
characterised  and  toxicologically  qualified  as  appropriate.  The  battery  of  genotoxicity  studies 
performed has shown that ospemifene itself does not possess a genotoxic potential. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  material  which  complies  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and 
EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  (visual), 
identity (IR, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), specific 
surface  area  (Ph.Eur.),  residual  solvents  (GC),  loss  on  drying  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy  metals  (Ph.  Eur.), 
sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  limits  (Ph.  Eur.).  The  specification  limits  regarding  the 
potential genotoxic impurities have been set and justified in line with ICH guideline M7. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  six  full  scale  batches  from  the  proposed  manufacturer  -  three  of  them 
micronized  at  a  different  site-  were  provided.  In  addition  another  three  batches  manufactured  by  a 
different manufacturer and two smaller batches used in clinical/ toxicological studies have also been 
provided.  Furthermore  historical  data  from  older  batches  were  presented  too.  All  the  presented 
results complied with the specifications valid at the time of testing confirming that the manufacturing 
process  is  sufficiently  robust  and  produces  active  substance  of  consistent  quality.  Since  the 
specification has been revised during the evaluation it is recommended to update batch analysis data 
with results from at least three new commercial scale batches tested to the revised specification.

Stability 
Stability  data  on  four  commercial  and  three  smaller  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the 
proposed  manufacturer  stored in  the  intended  commercial  package  for  up  to  60 months  under  long 
term  conditions  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  three  commercial  and  two  smaller  scale  batches  for  six 
months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were 
provided.  Additional  data  on  eight  pilot  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  a  different 
manufacturer  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package for  60 months  under  long  term  conditions 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH and, five pilot  scale batches for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: assay, impurities and loss on drying. The analytical methods 
used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  were  stability  indicating  as  shown  by  forced  degradation 
studies. 
Throughout  the  stability  program  all  results  were  within  the  set  specification  limits.  The  amount  of 
impurities did not increase during the storage under ICH long-term or accelerated conditions, and the 
results  of  the  chromatographic  analyses  showed  no  formation  of  degradation  products.  From  these 
results, it was also concluded that the particle size distribution remains stable during storage.  
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch  and  results 
suggest that ospemifene is not very sensitive to light. 
Results  on  stress  conditions  in  sample  solutions  under  acidic,  basic  and  oxidizing  conditions  as  well 
under direct daylight were also provided. The main degradation products detected vary depending on 
the degradation conditions. 
Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions for ospemifene 
are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  aim  of  the  formulation  development  was  to  develop  an  immediate  release  film-coated  tablet 
containing 60 mg of ospemifene as active substance.  
According to the Biopharmaceuticals Classification System (BCS), ospemifene is classified as a Class 
II  substance  (low  solubility  –  high  permeability).  The  excipients  selected  are  commonly  used 
Pharmacopoeial  grade  excipients  for  the  proposed  pharmaceutical  formulation.  The  rationale  for 
the  selection  of  excipients  in  the  commercial  formulation  was  presented  and  is  considered 
satisfactory. The capsule formulation used in early development was replaced by the proposed tablet 
formulation for phase III clinical studies once the dose and strength were selected. 
In  order  to  limit  the  commercial  batches  variability  only  one  manufacturing  site  is  proposed.  The 
investigation of the differences in the performance of clinical batches resulted in identifying steps of 
the  manufacturing  process  and  material  attributes  that  critically  affect  the  performance  of  the 
product.  The  investigations  have  resulted  in  establishing  suitable  IPCs  and  specifications  for  the 
active  substance  and  the  finished  product.  Ospemifene  is  a  BCS  Class  II  compound  and  once 
dissolved in the small intestine ospemifene is absorbed rapidly, suggesting that the extent and rate of 
the  active  substance  dissolution  in  the  small  intestine  will  control  bioavailability.  Hence  absorption, 
once in solution, is assumed to be not rate limiting (based upon Caco-2 cell permeation data). Given 
ospemifene’s  extremely  low  aqueous  solubility  its  saturation  solubility  in  fasted  state  intestinal 
conditions is very low. Therefore particle size and specific surface area are critical quality attributes. 
The  investigation  of  alternative  dissolution  methods  and  attempts  to  establish  an  in  vitro  in  vivo 
relationship  (IVIVR)  have  resulted  in  a  greater  understanding  of  the  factors  controlling  the  bio-

relevant  behaviour  of  the  tablets  as  discussed  above.  However  the  methodological  approximations 
made  do  not  allow  the  use  of  the  IVIVR  to  raw  conclusions  on  the  limits  for  PS  and  SSA  which  are 
therefore set in a more conservative way from the clinically investigated batches. 
Two  complimentary  quality  control  dissolution  tests  will  be  utilised  for  routine  release  of  the 
productand,  in  combination  with  other  release  parameters,  will  serve  to  assess  product  quality  of 
commercial batches. The choice of the methods has been adequately justified.  The first method has 
been found to be discriminating and capable of detecting changes to the manufacturing process that 
may occur during normal production. Known non-bioequivalent batches observed during development 
can  be  distinguished  using  this  method.  The  second  method  is  proposed  to  ensure  the  complete 
release  of  ospemifene  from  the  tablet  matrix  by  virtue  of  the  specification.  Both  methods  are 
intended to be used for batch release and stability testing of the product.  
The manufacturing process has been optimised especially with regard to the identified critical step. It 
is  considered  that  the  proposed  IPC  controls  ensure  that  the  manufacture  and  the  quality  of  the 
Senshio  tablets  are  under  sufficient  control.  However  as  an  additional  reassurance  the  applicant  is 
recommended to introduce a further IPC of the granulate particle size in order to better characterise 
and control this intermediate. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PVDC  -  Aluminium.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product 
Senshio  film-coated  tablets  are  manufactured  via  a  standard  wet  granulation  process  for  solid,  oral 
dosage  forms.  The  manufacturing  process  comprises  wet  granulation,  drying,  milling,  blending, 
compression and coating.  The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. Critical 
steps have been identified and appropriate in-process controls are put in place to ensure consistent 
quality of  the  product.   Successful  process  validation results  have  been provided  for  three  full  scale 
batches.  In  conclusion  it  is  considered  that  the  manufacture  is  sufficiently  robust  to  provide 
assurance  that  the  process  produces  the  finished  product  Senshio  film-coated  tablets  of  consistent 
quality, complying with the designated specification. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for: 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances (HPLC),  uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.- HPLC) and microbiological quality (Ph Eur).  
Batch analysis results of three full scale validation batches were provided. In addition batch analysis 
results  were  provided  for  one  pivotal  clinical  batch,  two  registration  batches  and  for  other  earlier 
clinical batches. All results complied with the specifications valid at the time of testing confirming the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification.  Since  the  finished  product  specification  has  been  revised  during  the  evaluation  it  is 
recommended  to  update  batch  analysis  data  with  results  from  at  least  three  new  commercial  scale 
batches tested to the revised specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability  data  on  three  full  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for 
nine months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  These  batches  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Stability  data  on 
another  three  smaller  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for up  to 
60 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for six months  under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
were  provided.  These  batches  were  packed  either  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing 
or in an alternative one not applied for.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  water  content,  assay,  related  substances,  dissolution  and 
microbiological  purity.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  All  results  complied 
with the specification at the time of testing. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. Results confirmed the product is stable when exposed to light. 
Stress  studies  under  temperature,  acid  hydrolysis,  base  hydrolysis,  light,  oxidation  and  heat  were 
conducted. The typical degradation products for each specific storage condition were identified and it 
is concluded that the related substances method is sufficiently stability-indicating. 
Based  on  the  presented  data  and  extrapolations,  the  proposed  shelf  life  at  the  proposed  storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC is supported. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  active  substance  and  the  finished  product  are 
controlled  by  adequate  specifications.  Since  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product 
specifications  have  been  revised  during  the  evaluation  it  is  recommended  to  update  batch  analysis 
data  with  results  from  at  least  three  new  commercial  scale  batches  of  both  active  substance  and 
finished  product  tested  to  the  revised  specification  (see  2.2.6.  Recommendations  for  future  quality 
development).  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacture  of  batches  of  Senshio  tablets  of 
consistent  quality  is  under  control.  Nevertheless,  as  an  additional  reassurance  the  applicant  is 
recommended  to  introduce  within  an  agreed  timeframe  a  further  IPC  for  a  finished  product 
intermediate (see 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development). In addition a satisfactory 
quality  control  methodology  is  now  in  place  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  commercial  product.    The 
results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality 
characteristics,  and  these in  turn  lead  to the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory 
and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical  performance of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and are controlled in a satisfactory  way. 
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- the applicant is recommended  to update active substance batch analysis data with results from at 
least three new commercial scale batches tested to the proposed specification. 
- the applicant is recommended  to update finished product batch analysis data with results from at 
least three new commercial scale batches tested to the proposed specification. 
-  the  applicant  is  recommended    to  investigate  the  possibility  to  test  the  particle  size  of  the  final 
granulate applying a three-point particle size specification as objective characterization and control of 
the final granulate. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were performed in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics  
In vitro receptor binding 
The estimated Ospemifene IC50 for ERα was 476 nM and for ERβ 513 nM; Ki values were 380 and 
410  nM  respectively.  The  binding  of  Ospemifene  appears  similar  to  that  of  Toremifene  and 
Tamoxifen. The competitive binding to ERα and ERβ of the three metabolites 4-hydroxyOspemifene 
(M-1),  4’-hydroxyOspemifene  (M-2)  and  4-hydroxy-,  side  chain  carboxylic  acid Ospemifene  (M-10) 
is at least as high, or possibly even higher than that of the parent compound. 
Ospemifene  is  a  Z-isomer  and  the  E-isomer  is  present  as  impurity  in  the  drug.  The  human  plasma 
Cmax  of  Ospemifene  is  about  2  µM,  roughly  4  times  the  estimated  IC50  values.  However,  the 
unbound fraction is not more than 1-2%, so if corrected for protein binding the IC50 for the ER is far 
above  the  human  Cmax.  Plasma  protein  binding  in  the  toxicological  species  was  also  high  (refer  to 
the  Pharmacokinetic  section):  protein  binding  was  97.0-97.4%  in  rat  plasma  and  99.0-99.6%  in 
monkey  plasma.  The  ex  vivo  plasma  protein  binding  of  total  radioactivity  was  lower in  both  species 
than  for  Ospemifene,  indicating  that  the  metabolites  have  a  lower  plasma  protein  binding  than 
Ospemifene. Based on similar serum protein binding and lower systemic concentrations in humans, in 
humans  the  contribution  of  the  metabolite  to  the  overall  effect  is  lower  than  that  of  the  parent 
compound.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 16/116 
 
  
  
 
However, for the laboratory species the situation is different. If it is assumed  that for these species 
serum protein binding of M-1 and parent compound is similar (actual values were not measured). in 
Particularly  in  rats  and  monkeys,  based  on  the  similar  or  higher  systemic  exposure  and  similar  or 
higher affinity for the receptor, the contribution of M-1 to the pharmacodynamic effect may be similar 
or  even  higher than  that  of  the  parent  compound -  and  thus  a  larger part of  the  pharmacodynamic 
effect in these species is due to the pharmacological action of metabolite M-1, compared to humans. 
The potency of M-1 regarding effects on rat vaginal and uterine tissue, however, was largely similar 
to that of the parent compound.  
In vitro receptor selectivity 
Based  on  limited  competitive  binding  data  it  was  considered  possible  that  both  the  progesterone 
receptor  and  the  androgen  receptor  contribute  to  effects  of  Ospemifene,  and  that  the  progesterone 
receptor contributes to effects of metabolites M-1 and M-2. 
In vitro receptor activation 
In  two  human  cell  systems,  estrogen-sensitive  human  breast  cancer  cells  (MCF-7)  and  human 
Ishikawa  endometrial  carcinoma  cells,  both  stably  transfected  with  reporter  construct  estrogen 
response  element  –  luciferase  (ERE-Luc),  Ospemifene  and  its  metabolites  M-1  and  M-2  showed 
generally  no  estrogenic  effects,  but  inhibited  transcription  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  17β-
estradiol.  The  antiestrogenic  effect  of  the  two  metabolites  was  seen  at  lower  concentrations 
compared to that of Ospemifene, the parent compound. 
In vivo primary pharmacodynamic effect 
After  oral  administration,  Ospemifene  dose-dependently  increased  the  thickness  of  the  vaginal 
epithelium  of  ovariectomised  (OVX)  rats  and  relative  organ  weight  of  the  vagina.  However,  the 
histological effect on the vaginal epithelium was different compared to that of 17β-estradiol and 17α-
ethinylestradiol.  The  estrogenic  action  of  Ospemifene  was  weaker  than  that  of  17β-estradiol  and 
more pronounced compared to that of Raloxifene.  
The  metabolites  M-1  and  M-2  appear  to  be  active  metabolites,  with  the  potency  of  M-1  being 
approximately  similar  to  that  of  Ospemifene,  while  the  potency  of  M-2  was  somewhat  lower.  Their 
relative  contributions  to  the  effects  of  Ospemifene  in  the  OVX  rat  vagina  cannot  be  accurately 
defined. The histological effect of both metabolites, if administered separately, was similar to that of 
Ospemifene. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In  vitro  receptor  binding  of  Ospemifene  was  tested  in  a  panel  of  23  receptors.  Ospemifene  showed 
IC50  >  1  µM  for  most  of  these  receptors,  except  for  the  histamine  H2  receptor  (IC50  =  0.56  µM). 
This result does not preclude secondary pharmacodynamic effects on the tested receptors. The tested 
receptor  screen  was  limited  to  receptors  found  in  nervous  tissue,  and  receptor  binding  of  the 
pharmacodynamically  active  metabolites  of  Ospemifene  was  not  tested.  However,  considering  the 
clinical documentation submitted within the scope of this application, CHMP didn’t find it necessary to 
provide more studies on this issue. 
Effect of Ospemifene and Metabolites (and other SERMs) on the Uterus 
Effects  on  the  uterus  were  investigated  in  three  different  rat  models:  the  immature,  the 
ovariectomised, and the intact adult rat model.  
In the immature rat model three oral daily doses of Ospemifene - or of its metabolites M-1, M-2 and 
M-3  -  increased  relative  uterine  weight  and  endometrial  epithelial  cell  thickness.  The  effects  of 
Ospemifene and metabolites were less than those of 17β estradiol and similar to those of Raloxifene. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 17/116 
 
  
  
If  combined  with17β  estradiol,  M-1  showed  some  anti-estrogenic  action.  Oral  administration  of 
Lasofoxifene showed similar effects as Ospemifene, but at lower doses, and also some antiestrogenic 
activity.  
Ovariectomised rats treated orally for periods up to 6 months with Ospemifene showed a dose related 
increase  of  relative  uterus  weight.  Metabolites  M-1  and  M-2  exerted  similar  effects  as  the  parent 
compound.  No  other  metabolites  were  tested.  The  effects  of  Ospemifene  were  similar  to  those  of 
Raloxifene  and  Droloxifene.  All  these  effects  were  lower  than  those  of  17α-ethinylestradiol  (oral)  or 
17β-estradiol (subcutaneous). Ospemifene decreased serum FSH and LH in ovariectomised rats to a 
similar degree as droloxifene and raloxifene but less than 17β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol. The 
ratio  LH/FSH  was  not  clearly  affected  by  Ospemifene,  droloxifene  or  raloxifene,  but  decreased  by 
17α-ethinylestradiol.  
In adult intact rats, oral treatment with Ospemifene for 3 months reduced the relative uterine weight, 
thus behaving as a partial estrogen receptor antagonist. Raloxifene produced comparable data. 
Effects on bone formation and resorption 
Effects  on  several  parameters  of  bone 
turnover,  bone  mass  density,  bone  strength, 
histomorphometry  were  investigated  in  in  ovariectomised  rats  in  a  series  of  studies,  with 
administration periods ranging from 4 weeks up to 12 months. In a 12 month bone study effects of 1, 
5 and 25 mg/kg/day Ospemifene (oral gavage) on bone and bone turnover markers were examined 
in  ovariectomised  (OVX)  rats.  The  results  from  these  studies  were  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the 
effects  on  body  weight,  which  interacted  with  effects  on  bone  parameters:  OVX  rats  gain  weight 
faster  than  sham-controls,  which  results  in  stronger  bones  due  to  higher  body  weight  load.  The 
decrease  of  body  weight  gain  caused  by  Ospemifene  treatment,  consistent  with  growth  inhibition 
caused  by  estrogenic  substances,  results  in  weaker  bones.  Nevertheless  it  was  established  that 
Ospemifene  decreased  ovariectomy-induced  trabecular  bone  loss.  Cortical  bone  was  much  less 
affected  by  ovariectomy  and  subsequently  Ospemifene  effects  were  not  as  clear  as  in  trabecular 
bone.  In  proximal  femur  neck,  labeled  surface  and  mineralizing  surface  (%  of  bone  surface)  were 
increased  by  ovariectomy  and  dose-dependently  decreased  by  Ospemifene,  indicating  a  diminished 
bone formation rate in Ospemifene treated rats.  
Plasma levels of Ospemifene and M-1 after one year of treatment showed that exposure to the major 
metabolite  M-1  exceeded  that  of  the  parent  compound  to  a  large  extent.  Therefore,  the  observed 
treatment  effect  could  have  been  for  a  large  part  due  to  the  activity  of  the  metabolite.  The  results 
from  the  shorter  lasting  studies  confirmed  the  effects  found  in  the  12  month  study  -  Ospemifene 
treatment  can  reduce  the  effect  of  ovariectomy  on  bone  density  and  morphometry.  However, 
treatment should start not too long after ovariectomy. If the period between ovariectomy and start of 
treatment became 4 weeks or longer, no clear treatment effect was observed. 
Effects on mammary gland and mammary tumour development 
Ospemifene showed anti-estrogenic effects in most studies using two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 
cells and in ZR-75-1 cells, at concentrations in the range of 1 – 10 μM. Its metabolites M-1 and M-2 
showed  similar  action,  but  already  at  lower  concentrations.  The  anti-estrogenic  potency  of 
Ospemifene in these studies was lower than that of Raloxifene.  
In an ex vivo study Ospemifene did not stimulate cell proliferation in human mammary gland primary 
tissue cultures. At 10 – 100 nM slight anti-proliferative activity - similar to that of Raloxifene but less 
than Tamoxifen - was observed. 
The effect of Ospemifene on BrdU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) labeling, prolactin immunoreactivity and 
mammary  gland  lobular  structures  was  evaluated  in  a  series  of  ovariectomised  rat  studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 18/116 
 
  
  
Ospemifene  and  other  SERMs  showed  no  estrogenic  action  in  the  mammary  gland  of  OVX  rats, 
whereas estradiol increased these markers. 
In  a  mouse  tumour  model  -  with  tumour  induction  by  dimethylbenzanthracene  and  tumour  growth 
promotion  by  medroxyprogesterone  acetate  -  Ospemifene  prevented  the  development  of  mammary 
tumours,  compared  to  negative  control.  The  mammary  tumours  in  the  control  mice  had  a  low 
expression of ERα and no (detectable) expression of ERβ. 
In  an  ovariectomised  nude  mouse  human  MCF-7  tumor  model,  at  1-50  mg/kg/day  p.o.  Ospemifene 
effects consisted of very limited inhibition of tumour growth in the presence of estradiol, no effect if 
estradiol was removed and tumours were small and slight inhibition of tumour shrinkage if estradiol 
was removed but tumours were large. So, although tumour growth was not promoted in presence or 
absence  of  estradiol,  regression  of  tumours  in  the  absence  of  estradiol  was  slightly  inhibited.  The 
biological significance of the observed small differences is uncertain. 
The effect of Ospemifene on Dimethylbenzoanthrasene-induced (DMBA-induced) mammary cancer in 
rats  was  studied.  Ospemifene  treatment  showed  non-dose  dependent  antitumor  activity  at  dose 
levels  ranging  from  3  to  30  mg/kg,  administered  for  4  weeks  or  longer.  It  was  not  investigated 
whether  the  DMBA  induced  tumours  contained  ER  or  were  dependent  on  estrogenic  compounds  for 
their  growth.  So  no  conclusion  is  possible  whether  the  apparent  tumour  inhibiting  potential  of 
Ospemifene was due to its anti-estrogenic properties. 
The  results  of  these  studies  were  also  consistent  with  the  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  (refer  to 
Toxicology section), showing lower incidences of mammary tumours. 
Effect on vascular wall 
The  effect  of  Ospemifene  on  vascular  wall  was  studied in  vitro  using  freshly isolated  rat  endothelial 
cells from the aorta and a human vascular smooth muscle cell line. At 10 µM Ospemifene had a slight 
growth inhibitory effect in rat endothelial cells and a slight stimulatory effect in the human  vascular 
smooth muscle cells. These small effects at a very high concentration were not considered relevant. 
Effects on vasomotor symptoms 
In  a  rat  model  for  hot  flushes,  oral  doses  of  1  –  100  mg/kg/day  Ospemifene  dose  dependently 
reduced  the  magnitude  of  hot  flushes  –  however,  these  effects  were  less  effective  than  those 
observed with 0.3 mg/kg/day of 17α-ethinylestradiol. 
Effects on Cholesterol levels 
Ospemifene  treatment  consistently  decreased  cholesterol  levels  in  pharmacodynamic  studies  in  rats 
as well as in repeated dose toxicity studies using mouse, dog and monkey models.  
Effects on urodynamics in ovariectomised rats 
In  an  ovariectomised  rat  model  of  postmenopausal  urodynamic  problems,  no  clear  effect  of  an  oral 
Ospemifene dose of 30 mg/kg/day was observed.  
Immunological effects in vitro 
In  two  in  vitro  studies  on  oxidative  burst  of  human  leukocytes  in  whole  blood  and  on  TNF-α 
production  by  LPS  induced  monocytes,  Ospemifene  showed  little  to  no  effect  on  immunological 
function.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Central Nervous System 
Six studies were done to investigate effects on the central nervous function. Only a few effects were 
seen,  in  two  of  these  studies,  at  high  doses.  These  were  considered  not  to  be  of  biological 
significance.  The  general  toxicity  studies  don’t  reveal  evidence  of  CNS  toxicity  (refer  to  Toxicology 
section).  
Cardiovascular and Respiratory System 
Effects  of  Ospemifene  and  its  metabolite  M-1  at  concentrations  of  0.3,  1,  3,  or  30  μM  on  HERG-1 
delayed rectifier currents were shown in transfected HEK 293 cells stably expressing this K+-channel 
(GLP study). Ospemifene and its metabolite M-1 exerted significant inhibitory effects on the relative 
tail current amplitude. In two GLP in vivo cardiovascular studies in dogs and monkeys, no effect was 
found on cardiovascular parameters at single oral doses up to 100 mg/kg in dogs and 1000 mg/kg in 
monkeys.  Further  cardiovascular  measurements  were  done  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies 
(revealing no evidence of cardiovascular safety issues). 
In  the  dog  model,  effects  on  blood  gasses  and  electrolytes,  respiratory  functions  and  locomotor 
activity were also investigated - no effects were observed with Ospemifene.  
Other safety pharmacology studies 
Single doses of 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg Ospemifene did not affect intestinal motility in NMRI mice 
(SC route), skeletal muscle tone in NMRI mice (oral route) or kidney function in SD rats (SC route). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicokinetics  have  mainly  been  studied  in  female  mice,  rats  and 
Cynomolgus monkeys, although other animal species and males have been used.

The  solubility  of  Ospemifene  in  water  is  poor  and  a  maximum  concentration  of  0.4  µg/mL  could  be 
dissolved.  The  studies  investigating  if  Ospemifene  and  M-1  are  substrates  for  P-glycoprotein  and 
BCRP  were  performed  with  an  added  concentration of  1  µM.  Free  concentrations  of  Ospemifene  and 
M-1 were 100 nM and 20.5 nM, respectively. Studies to investgate whether Ospemifene and M-1 are 
substrates  for  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3  were  also  performed  with  an  added  concentration  of  1  µM  - 
free concentration of Ospemifene was 384 nM while free concentration of M-1 was 697 nM.  
While the in vitro permeability of Ospemifene was high, the absorption in monkey was low (F of 11% 
for  the  radioactivity)  and  in  rat  moderate  (F  is  49%  for  total  radioactivity).  After  absorption, 
Ospemifene is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism in the non-clinical species, as indicated by a 
low oral bioavailability in rat and monkey (both ~3%). In humans, the absorption is higher and the 
first-pass  metabolism  is  lower.  A  dose  of  2000  mg/kg  to  the  non-clinical  species  results  in  a 
comparable AUC to humans dosed with 1 mg/kg.  
Distribution 
Ospemifene  is  rapidly  eliminated  from  the  systemic  circulation  in  rats  (t½  is  ~1  h).  In  addition, 
Ospemifene exhibited a low volume of distribution (0.3 L/kg) in rat studies, indicating distribution in 
total  body  fluids,  while  M-1  exhibits  a  moderate  volume  of  distribution  (3.8  L/kg),  indicating  a  high 
binding to peripheral tissues. The clearance of Ospemifene and M-1 was moderate to high, which is in 
line  with  the  estimated  rapid  elimination  half-lives.  For  monkey,  no  kinetic  parameters  other  than

AUC and Cmax were determined for Ospemifene and M-1. The kinetic data in the non-clinical species 
indicate that Ospemifene is subject to entero-hepatic recirculation. 
In mice and dog, exposure to M-1 is less abundant than to Ospemifene, with metabolic ratios based 
on  AUC  values  ranging  from  ~0.2  to  0.8  in  mice  and  ~0.02  in  dog;  in  monkeys,  metabolic  ratios 
ranged from 0.9 to 2.0 and in female rats, the metabolic ratio ranged from 0.7 to 2.5 - and tended to 
decrease with increasing dose.  
M-2  was  detected  in  mice  and  rats  in  much  lower  amounts  (metabolic  ratios  between  ~0.02  and 
0.07).  The  major  non-clinical  species  were  rat  and  monkey,  which  had  similar  metabolic  ratios 
compared to  humans.  In  general,  in  all  non-clinical  species  and  over the   investigated dose  ranges, 
systemic  exposure  to  Ospemifene  -  as  well  as  metabolites  M-1  and  M-2  -  increases  in  a  less  than 
dose  proportional  manner.  The  level  of  less  than  dose  proportionately  is  greater  following  multiple 
dosing and at higher doses. In some instances at high doses, exposure to Ospemifene and M-1 even 
decreases with increasing dose. 
In humans, the plasma protein binding of Ospemifene was 98.6 to >99% and of M-1 was 98.3%. The 
plasma  protein  binding  of  Ospemifene  was  also  high  in  animal  models,  and  the  free  fraction  varied 
considerably between species (2.7-3% in rat and 0.4-1% in monkey). Considerable differences were 
also seen between the plasma protein binding of Ospemifene in non-clinical species and humans. This 
led  CHMP  to  make  a  Recommendation  for  further  investigation  of  the  high-protein  binding  of  the 
compounds, the potential considerable difference in free fraction between species, and the relevance 
of the active metabolite M-1 (and M-2) – the Applicant has agreed to do so post-authorisation (refer 
to Conclusions on Non-Clinical aspects). 
Based on radioactivity, the blood-to-serum ratio at 5 and 10 minutes after IV administration was 0.96 
in rat and 0.49 in monkey, indicating that Ospemifene does not specifically distribute to erythrocytes. 
After  8h  post  dose,  the  blood-to-serum  ratio  in  rats  was  up  to  five-fold  greater,  indicating  that  the 
blood-to-serum ratio is considerable higher for the metabolites. In humans, the ratio of AUC0-∞ for 
total  radioactivity  in  whole  blood  to  serum  ranged  between  0.57  and  0.83  for  individual  subjects. 
Seeing  as  the  blood-to-serum  ratio  for  total  radioactivity  in  rat  and  monkey  was  provided,  but  not 
specifically for Ospemifene and M-1, CHMP made a Recommendation for the company to provide the 
blood-to-plasma ratio for Ospemifene (in monkey and rat) and the blood-to-plasma ratio for M-1 (in 
rat, monkey and human) – the Applicant has commited to do submit these data. 
A radioactivity half-life of 60 hours was observed in a rat study with [14C]-radiolabeled Ospemifene. 
In  a  previous  rat  distribution  study  with  the  [3H]-radiolabel,  a  radioactivity  half-life  of  48-70  hours 
was  seen  (thus  comparable  to  the  [14C]-radiolabel).  In  the  [14C]-radiolabeled  study,  no  Ospemifene 
half-life  was  determined  -  but  half-life  was  1-13  hours  in  the  previous  rat  distribution  study.  In 
humans,  the  radioactivity  half-life  was  99  hours  and  for  Ospemifene  25  hours.  The  half-life  of 
radioactivity and Ospemifene is shorter in rat than in humans. Based on the 24 hour distribution data 
and  the  calculated  half-lives,  it  can  be  expected  that  accumulation  could  occur  in  humans  in  the 
following organs following repeated dosing: adrenal gland, haderian gland, spleen, liver, skin, female 
reproductive  organ  (ovary,  oviduct,  clitoral  gland),  cervical  lymph  node,  kidney,  fat,  bone  marrow, 
and lung.  
Metabolism 
After absorption, Ospemifene is extensively metabolised. M-1 is the major observed metabolite and is 
pharmacologically  active.  In  rats,  monkeys  and  humans,  respectively  84%,  75%  and  79%  of  the 
total  radioactivity  was  identified.  The  formation  of  M-1  was  higher  in  monkey  compared  to  rat  and 
humans.  M-2,  M-4  and  M-8  were  human  specific  plasma  metabolites,  although  in  minor  quantities. 
Metabolite  M-10  was  present  in  plasma  from  monkey  and  humans,  but  not  in  plasma  from  rat.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 21/116 
 
  
  
formation  of  M-3  is  higher  in  the  non-clinical  species  compared  to  humans.  No  glucuronide 
metabolites  were  observed  in  plasma  from  all  species.  Overall,  these  results  indicate  that  some 
interspecies  differences  occur  in  metabolite  profile,  but  that  the  major  human  metabolite  (M-1)  is 
present in the non-clinical species. A total of around 6% of the total radioactivity AUC in humans is 
present as human specific plasma metabolite. 
M-9  is  detected  as  a  M-1  hydroxide,  M-11  as  a  metabolite  hydroxylated  at  the  side  chain  of 
Ospemifene  and  M-12  as  a  hydroxy  metabolite  of  M-11  only  in  in  vitro  studies.  Since  the  chemical 
structure of M-6 was not identified, M-6 will be described as dihydroxy Ospemifene, but is most likely 
3,4-dihydroxy Ospemifene (combination of the hydroxide reaction of M-1 and M-4).  
Figure 1: Proposed metabolic pathway of Ospemifene in non-clinical species and humans 
CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of Ospemifene – however, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 
and 2C19 are also contribute to a lesser extent. CYP3A4 was identified as the major CYP involved in 
the formation of M-1 and M-2 and their transformation to other metabolites.

Based  on  the in  vitro  CYP  induction  studies in  human  cryopreserved  hepatocytes,  it is not  expected 
that Ospemifene or M-1 will lead to CYP induction at clinically relevant systemic concentrations (1.0 
µM for Ospemifene and 259 nM for M-1). However, it was unknown if Ospemifene could lead to CYP 
induction  in  the  intestine,  since  the  maximal  intestinal  concentration  (63  µM)  is  higher  than  the 
concentrations  investigated  (1-20  µM).  Therefore,  CHMP made  a  Recommendation  for  the  Applicant 
to  investigate  the  CYP  induction  potential  of  Ospemifene  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations  and 
exclude  potential  induction  potential  of  CYP3A4  in  the  intestine  –  this  information  can  be  provided 
post-authorisation.  
Several  drug-drug  interactions  studies  were  performed  by  the  Applicant.  No  clinically  significant 
interactions  due to  a  reduced  plasma  protein  binding  of  warfarin  are  expected.  At  clinically  relevant 
maximal organ concentrations (50 × Cmax,unbound = 50 × 0.014 × 0.785 = 0.55 µg/mL), Ospemifene 
is  not  a  CYP  inhibitor.  However,  at  the  maximal  intestinal  concentration  (0.1  ×  dose/250  mL  = 
24 µg/mL) Ospemifene could be an inhibitor of 2C9 (IC50 of 3.8 µg/mL) in the intestine. Ospemifene 
was not a CYP inducer at  clinically relevant organ concentrations (50 × Cmax,unbound = 50 × 0.014 × 
0.785  =  0.55  µg/mL).  The  induction  potential  of  Ospemifene  was  not  investigated  at  clinically 
relevant intestinal concentrations (0.1 × dose/250 mL = 24 µg/mL). Weak induction was observed at 
7.6 µg/mL for CYP3A4, indicating that Ospemifene could lead to a CYP3A4 induction in the intestine. 
At clinically relevant maximal organ concentrations (50 × Cmax,unbound = 50 × 0.017 × 0.10 = 0.085 
µg/mL),  M-1  was  not  a  CYP  inhibitor.  At  clinically  relevant  maximal  organ  concentrations  (50  × 
Cmax,unbound = 50 × 1 × 0.03 µg/mL = 1.5 µg/mL), M-2 was not a CYP inhibitor. 
Additionally,  Ospemifene  and  M-1  are  glucuronidated  to  pharmacologically  inactive  metabolites  by 
UGTs – meaning that drugs that inhibit the CYPs and UGTs involved in the metabolism of Ospemifene 
could  have  a  potential  effect  on  the  efficacy  of  this  product.  Since  there  is  a  possibility  that  in 
humans  Ospemifene  and  M-1  are  glucuronidated  in  the  liver  and  deconjugated  in  the  intestine  (as 
was  observed  in  the  non-clinical  species),  CHMP  made  a  Recommendation  for  the  Applicant  to 
provide information that this is unlikely to occur or provide information on the UGTs involved in the 
glucuronidation of Ospemifene and M-1 (refer to Conclusions on Non-Clinical aspects).  
Ospemifene is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant 
systemic  concentrations.  However,  the  investigated  Ospemifene  concentrations  are  lower  than  the 
maximum intestinal concentration (63 µM), and higher concentrations could not be investigated due 
to solubility problems. The Applicant performed a clinical DDI study with ketoconazole, as an example 
of  a  potent  inhibitor of  CYP3A4  and  a  moderate  inhibitor  of  P-glycoprotein.  An  increase  in  Cmax  and 
AUC of 40% was observed for Ospemifene when concomitantly administered with ketoconazole. It is 
therefore unlikely that Ospemifene is a substrate for P-glycoprotein to a clinically relevant extent. It 
remains  unknown  if  Ospemifene  is  a  substrate  for  BCRP.  However,  due  to  lack  of  availability  of 
specific  BCRP  inhibitors,  is  not  feasible  to  perform  a  DDI  study.  Therefore,  at  CHMP’s  request,  the 
Applicant  added  in  section  5.2  of  the  SmPC  an  quote  about  the  uncertainties  around  intestinal 
transport via BCRP and that one should be careful with concomitant use with a BCRP inhibitor. 
Ospemifene  and  M-1  were  inhibitors  of  OCT1,  and  M-1  also  of  OATP1B1  (contrary  to  Ospemifene 
which  did  not  inhibit  OATP1B1).  On  the  other  hand,  Ospemifene  and  M-1  weren’t  inhibitors  of  P-
glycoprotein,  BCRP,  OATP1B3,  OAT1,  OAT3  and  OCT2  in  the  in  vitro  inhibition  studies.  A  statement 
on  potential  interactions  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Currently  the  clinical  consequences  of 
inhibition  of  these  transporters  are  unknown.  To  collect  more  data  on  potential  inhibition  of 
transporters,  CHMP  made  a  Recommendation  for  the  Applicant  to  provide  BSEP  transporter  studies 
post-marketing (refer to Conclusions on Non-Clinical aspects).

Excretion 
Excretion  via  faeces  (either  via  bile  or  via  direct  secretion  into  the  intestine)  was  determined  to  be 
the  major  route  of  elimination,  while  excretion  via  urine  is  a  minor  route  in  the  non-clinical  species 
and in humans. Furthermore, the intestinal flora is most likely involved in the deconjugation of the M-
1 and M-2 conjugates back to M-1 and M-2, followed by enterohepatic circulation. 
Isomer interconversion 
As  mentioned  previously,  Ospemifene  is  a  Z-isomer  and  the  E-isomer  is  present  as  impurity  in  the 
drug  formulation  (refer  to  Pharmacology  section).  No  conversion  was  observed  in  the  in  vitro 
metabolite  identification  studies,  and  no  studies  regarding  this  issue  were  performed  in  non-clinical 
species.  Even  though  it  is  unlikely  that  significant  conversion  of  the  Z-isomer  to  the  E-isomer  will 
occur in humans, CHMP has made a Recommendation for the Applicant to provide information on the 
absence of the conversion (refer also to Clinical section of the report on this issue). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The acute toxicity of Ospemifene is low; no hamsters, minipigs or rats died at single oral doses of 
1000,  500  or  2000  mg/kg,  respectively  -  and  no  drug-related  effects  were  seen.  Non-GLP  pilot 
toxicity  studies  with  Ospemifene  were  performed  in  mice,  rats,  hamsters,  dogs  and  monkeys. 
Ospemifene showed a high tolerability in all animals. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  a  4-week  study  in  rats,  Ospemifene  showed  comparable  effects  as  Toremifene  and  4-hydroxy-
Toremifene,  but  at  higher  doses.  Uterus  atrophy,  decreased  ovary  weight,  corpora  lutea  and 
endometrial glands, hypertrophy of luminal epithelium, and increased cystic follicles were all related 
to  the  SERM-like  hormonal  activity  of  Ospemifene.  Kidney  weight  was  increased,  but  no 
nephrotoxicity was shown. 
In  mice,  Ospemifene  was  well  tolerated  up  to  2000  mg/kg  for  13  weeks  (4  –  8  times  human 
exposure). At low or medium doses, oral administration of Ospemifene showed ovarian cysts, uterus 
cystic dilatation of endometrial glands, reduction of pituitary gland and uterus weight in females and 
cellular hypertrophy, increased cytoplasmic vacuolation in testis and prostate gland atrophy in males 
(at  high  doses).  These  effects  were  probably  related  to  the  hormonal  activity  of  Ospemifene. 
Increased  liver  weight  and  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  was  shown  in  males  and  females  and  were 
probably caused by metabolic adaptation.  
In rats, Ospemifene was well tolerated up to 2000 mg/kg for 13 weeks (3 times human exposure for 
parent compound, 8 times human exposure for M1-metabolite), and up to 300 mg/kg for 26 weeks - 
although  food  intake  and  body  weight  decreased  at  all  doses.  At  0.5  –3  mg/kg  ovarian  and  uterus 
weight  decreased,  but  increased  at  ≥30  mg/kg.  At  low  doses  in  females,  the  following  were 
observed: ovarian cysts and black foci; squamous cell metaplasia of uterus; large follicles; decrease 
of  luteal  and  endometrial  glands;  hypertrophy  of  luminal  epithelium;  increase  of  LH,  FSH  and 
estradiol and metestrus or abnormal diestrus. At high doses, endometrial hyperplasia was shown. In 
males,  prostate  weight  decreased  and  prostate  atrophy  was  shown  at  low  doses.  At  ≥32  mg/kg 
seminal  vesicle  atrophy  occurred.  These  changes  in  reproductive  organs  were  likely  due  to 
disturbances  induced  in  the  normal  hormonal  cycles  and  hormone  levels  in  fertile  animals.  Total 
cholesterol levels were reduced dose-responsively down to maximally 42% of control. At ≥50 mg/kg, 
males showed higher relative adrenal (up to 100%) and liver weights (up to 48%), possibly related 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 24/116 
 
  
  
to  metabolic  adaptation.  The  NOAEL  after  26  weeks  was  300  mg/kg/day,  but  the  NOEL  was  <0.5 
mg/kg/day. Because the toxicity of Ospemifene is principally caused by its pharmacodynamic activity, 
it is difficult to determine a clear safety margin. 
Low  exposure  in  animals  when  compared  to  humans  was  the  main  issue  in  all  pivotal  nonclinical 
studies,  especially  in  non-human  primates.  Nevertheless,  drug-related  hepatic  changes  in  the  39-
week  oral  toxicity  study  in  female  monkeys  are  seen.  Liver  changes  were  not  only  observed  in 
rodents  (where  they  could  be  an  expected  species-specific  estrogenic  effect)  but  also  in  monkeys. 
Based on the available data, it could not be excluded that the enzyme changes seen in monkeys are 
relevant  for  humans.  However,  because  no  liver  toxicity  was  seen  in  the  histopathological 
examination of the monkeys, and the lack of any clinical signs regarding increase of ALT in humans, 
it was concluded that this is unlikely to represent a safety concern for humans. 
In  dogs,  increased  alkaline  phosphatase,  increases  in  uterine  (associated  with  thickening  of  the 
uterus  and  cervix)  and  liver  weights  (up  to  by  164%  or  51%,  respectively),  decrease  in  ovarian 
weight  (up  to  -45%)  and  cystic  uterine  endometrial  hyperplasia  were  seen  in  all  treated  animals. 
Ovarian  antral  follicles  were  absent  in  all  treated  animals  and  corpora  lutea  were  missing. 
Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed at 200 mg/kg. NOEL was <80 mg/kg/day and 
NOAEL  was  500  mg/kg/day  (2.6  times  human  exposure).  However,  dogs  were  not  suitable  for  the 
non-rodent  chronic  toxicity  species  as  only  minor  amounts  of  the  major  human  metabolite  M-1  is 
formed. 
In  female  monkeys,  Ospemifene  caused  increased  liver  weight  and  ALT  level,  while  serum  sex 
hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG)  levels  were  significantly  suppressed  at  all  treatments.  Estradiol, 
FSH,  progesterone,  ovarian  and  uterine  weights,  and  ovarian,  follicular  and  paraovarian  cysts 
increased.  There  were  no  fresh  corpora  luteae.  Endometrial  hyperplasia  was  seen  in  the  uterus. 
Decidual  reaction  in  endocervix  and  uterus,  inflammatory  cell  foci,  glandular  vacuolation  and 
glandular  atrophy  in  mammary  glands  were  seen  at  low  doses  after  39  weeks.  At  higher  doses, 
cervical  squamous  metaplasia,  glycogen  storage  in  liver,  increased  creatinine  and  fresh  corpora 
luteae,  and  epithelial  atrophy  of  the  vagina  occurred.  Most  of  the  findings  are  considered  to  be 
exaggerated  pharmacological  effects  of  a  compound  from  the  SERM  class.  Drug-related  changes  in 
ALT  levels  and  elevated  hepatic  glycogen  storage  may  be  also  related  to  an  estrogen  agonistic 
hepatic activity of the study drug. The NOEL was considered <15 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 150 
mg/kg/day (ca. 0.6 times human exposure). As mentioned before, since the toxicity of Ospemifene is 
mainly derived from its pharmacodynamic activity, it is difficult to determine a clear safety margin. 
Major human metabolites M-1 and M-2 are  formed by the mouse, rat and the cynomolgus monkey. 
Systemic  exposure  to  Ospemifene  and  its  major  metabolites  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies 
mostly covered or exceeded exposures achieved in patients following administration of a therapeutic 
dose  of  60  mg.  Thus,  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  potential  toxicity  of  Ospemifene  and  its 
metabolites was assessed adequately in relevant species. 
Genotoxicity 
The battery of genotoxicity studies performed showed that Ospemifene does not possess a genotoxic 
potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
In male mice, an unexpected in-life finding - swelling of the urogenital and/or abdominal areas - was 
recorded  in  animals  given  Ospemifene,  the  onset  of  which  occurred  in  week  3  of  dosing  (2-year 
carcinogenicity study). All dose levels (100 – 1500 mg/kg) caused severe abdominal organ herniation 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 25/116 
 
  
  
into the scrotal sac, which led to several early deaths in all male groups. The severity of the adverse 
effect led to cessation of dosing of surviving males in week 14. It should be remarked that this was 
not observed in the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study with the same mouse strain and comparable 
doses  (50  –  2000  mg/kg).  A  study  was  performed  to  investigate the  age-dependence  of  the  effect, 
however an explanation for the difference between the 13-week study and the oncogenicity study in 
male mice was not found. These effects were probably caused by the hormonal actions of SERMs on 
developing  immature  mouse  hormone-sensitive  tissues.  Similar  hormonal  developmental  adverse 
effects  in  the  urogenital  area  have  also  been  observed  before  with,  for  example,  Tamoxifen  and 
estrogens.  Because  Ospemifene  is  not  indicated  for  male  humans,  CHMP  considered that  no  further 
studies were necessary on this issue. 
At  100,  400  or  1500  mg/kg/day  for  2  years,  in  female  mice  there  was  statistical  significant 
occurrence  of  adrenal  subcapsular  cell  adenoma,  adrenal  cortical  tumor,  liver  hepatocellular  tumor, 
ovary  adenoma/carcinoma,  ovary  sex  cord/stromal  tumor  and  pituitary  adenoma/carcinoma.  The 
exposures were 2.1-, 4.0- and 4.7-fold compared to the intended human exposure. 
In male and female rats at 10, 50 and 300 mg/kg/day in the 2-year carcinogenicity study, there was 
a  statistical  significant  occurrence  of  liver  hepatocellular  tumors  and  thymus  epithelial  tumors.  The 
majority  of  the  other  changes  reported  for  the  study  (including  adrenal  and  kidney  changes)  were 
considered  to  be  adaptive  physiological  changes,  or  changes  associated  with  reduced  body  weight 
gain. Type of tumors and their incidences were comparable to those seen in the oncogenicity studies 
with  other  SERMs.  The  marked  increase  in  thymic  tumors  at  all  dose  levels  has  not  been  reported 
during other SERM oncogenicity studies. This effect was probably also due to the antiestrogenic effect 
of the study drug in this target tissue, which could have been attenuated by the physiological thymic 
involution (atrophy) process induced by estrogens starting during puberty. The Applicant provided a 
plausible model for forming of thymomas in Wister rats and presented the following arguments: 
• estrogen modulates thymic development and age-related involution, 
• estrogen has an atrophic effect and reduces thymic cellularity, 
•  in  an  animal  model  of  human  thymoma  (BUF/Mna  rats)  inhibition  of  the  oestrogen  activity  in 
young  (pre-pubertal)  animals  can  promote  thymoma  development  indicating  that  anti-oestrogenic 
activity can promote thymic tumor development, 
•  Ospemifene  treatment  increased  the  incidences  of  thymoma,  incidences  of  thymic  atrophy 
appeared reduced. 
Thymomas  have  not  been  seen  with  other  SERMs.  Much  epithelial  hyperplasia  in  Fischer  rats  was 
caused  by  Raloxifene,  but  no  extra  (respective  to  control)  epithelial  hyperplasia  was  seen  in  Wistar 
rats  by  Ospemifene.  However,  Wistar  rats  are  much  more  sensitive  to  thymomas  then  Fischer  rats. 
With  regards  to  malignant  tumors,  there  were  only  2  at  the  high  dose  (1.2  times  intended  human 
exposure based on AUC).  There was  no increase in  the incidence of thymoma in the 2-year mouse. 
There  were  no  serious  treatment-related  lesions  of  the  thymus  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies 
with  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  has  added  thymic  epithelial  tumours  as  an 
Important  Potential  Risk  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  and  will  address  this  issue  in  their  Post-
authorisation safety study (Annex II condition). 
A  different  balance  of  estrogenic/anti-estrogenic  effects  between  Raloxifene  and  Ospemifene  in 
different  species  and/or  organs  is  conceivable,  if  not  probable.  Although  the  suggested  mechanism 
has not been proven yet, a risk for the intended target patients is not very likely. 
Compared  to  human  exposure  at  the  clinical  dose,  the  exposure  to  Ospemifene  in  rats  at  week  52 
was  0.3-,  1.0-  and  1.2-fold.  Exposure  to  the  metabolite  M-1  was  3.9-,  8.2-  and  10.2-fold,  and

exposure  to  M2  was  0.7  fold  for  50  mg/kg  and  0.95  for  300  mg/kg  compared  to  human  exposure. 
Because  of  the  SERM-like/estrogenic  nature  of  the  findings  in  rodents,  it  is  unlikely  that  they  are 
relevant for clinical use in postmenopausal women. 
Ospemifene did not induce DNA adduct formation in the rat liver. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No fertility studies were performed – this was agreed to by CHMP, as Ospemifene is only indicated for 
post-menopausal women.  
Ospemifene  did  not  induce  malformations  in  offspring  of  rats  and  rabbits.  However,  the  exposures 
were far below the intended human exposure. Already a low dose of 0.25 mg/kg caused some dead 
animals,  dystocia,  and  vaginal  bleeding  in  dams.  At  0.05  and  0.25  mg/kg  an  increased  post-
implantation loss, an increased number of dead pups at birth and an increased incidence of postnatal 
loss of pups between days 0 - 4 were observed. The F1 generation showed no clinical signs, and no 
effects on mating performance and fertility were observed.  
The  reproductive  toxicity  may  be  partly  explained  by  the  observed  severe  reduction  in  body  weight 
gain,  but  probably  the  hormonal  properties  of  Ospemifene  were  involved  in  causing  the  inability  to 
normal  delivery.  All  doses  tested  are  far  below  the  intended  human  exposure,  thus  Ospemifene 
should not be used during pregnancy – it should be kept in mind, however, that Ospemifene is only 
indicated for post-menopausal women. 
Other toxicity studies 
Ospemifene is not expected to be phototoxic.

As  a  result  of  the  above  results,  the  available  data  do  not  allow  to  conclude  definitively  on  the 
potential risk of Ospemifene to the environment. 
Regarding  the  endocrine  disrupting  mode  of  action,  neither  of  the  chronic  fish  studies  shows  any 
effect  up  to  the  solubility  limit.  Because  of  this,  a  full  fish  life  cycle  test  does  not  need  to  be 
performed.  
Ospemifene  is  persistent  and  toxic  (Toxic  to  reproduction  Cat.  2).  However,  Ospemifene  does  not 
meet  the  B-criterion  and  is  therefore  not  PBT,  nor  vPvB.  A  PBT  assessment  of  M1  could  not  be 
performed since experimental data were lacking, however, the CHMP’s opinion is that the B criterion 
would not be met for M1 - further PBT assessment was therefore considered not necessary.  
Risk to groundwater, sediment and sewage treatment plants seem negligible. 
Risk  assessment  for  the  soil  compartment  was  initiated,  however,  the  submitted  toxicity  study  with 
plants  (OECD  208)  is  considered  invalid  as  it  does  not  fulfil  the  test  guideline  requirements  with 
respect to the number of concentrations tested. A range finding was missing and the concentrations 
selected as dose-response were too few and spaced too closely together; which did not allow for dose 
response  modelling.  In  addition,  several  statistically  significant  effects  were  observed  that  were  all 
disregarded  as  'not  biologically  significant'.  A  well-established  NOEC  for  plants  cannot  be  derived 
from this test. The CHMP has made a Recommendtion for the Applicant to repeat the OECD 208 test 
and  to  conduct  the  study  according  to  the  guideline  –  the  company  has  committed  to  do  so  and 
provide  the  results  post-authorisation  (refer  to  the  Conclusion  on  Non-Clinical  aspects).  A  test  with 
three species (1 monocotyledon, 2 dicotyledons) is acceptable.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The  provided  non-clinical  data  at  receptor  level  were  rather  limited.  However  a  large  number  of  in 
vivo studies was provided, confirming that the overall in vivo pharmacodynamic profile of Ospemifene 
and  its  major  metabolite(s)  results  in  a  pattern  similar  to  that  of  known  SERMs.  Based  on  the 
receptor  affinity  and  activation  studies,  the  pharmacokinetic  data in  the  non-clinical  in  vivo  studies, 
and studies in which the  major metabolite was tested separately, the pharmacodynamic effect after 
Ospemifene  administration  can  be  concluded  to  be  due  to  at  least  the  combination  of  the  parent 
compound  and  the  major  metabolite.  Other  metabolites  may  contribute  to  a  lower  extent,  due  to 
lower  exposure.  Overall,  after  administration  of  Ospemifene,  the  effects  in  vaginal  tissue  are 
estrogen-like  (although  the  histological  characteristics  are  different  from  those  of  a  pure  estrogen), 
effects  in  bone  tissue  resemble  those  of  estrogens  (mediation  by  estrogen  receptor  not  shown),  in 
mammary  tissues  the  effects  were  mainly  anti-estrogenic  and  in  uterine  tissue  partly  agonistic  and 
partly antagonistic. In a hERG assay Ospemifene was clearly positive, but no effects on QT interval or 
other  cardiovascular  parameters  were  found  in  dog  and  monkey  studies  (this  will  be  further 
addressed in section 2.4 - Clinical aspects).  
Pharmacokinetics 
Regarding  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Ospemifene,  the  concerns  identified  were  difficulties  in  solubility 
of the product in in vitro studies, stability of the Z-isomer of Ospemifene, the lack of information on 
plasma protein binding of the metabolites, comparison of the blood-to-serum ratio of Ospemifene and 
M-1  in  animals  and  humans,  missing  information  on  CYP  induction  and  inhibition,  and  effects  on 
transporters and UGTs. However, the Applicant has, following CHMP Recommendations, commited to 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 29/116 
 
  
  
 
investigate these issues post-authorisation (please refer to the section “Conclusion on the non-clinical 
aspects” for a detailed list of Recommendations to be fulfilled.) 
Toxicology 
Toxicological  studies  showed  mainly  the  expected  effects  due  to  the  pharmacodynamic  action  of  a 
SERM. Clear safety margins on the toxicity of Ospemifene are difficult to establish, because nearly all 
toxicity  is  related  to  the  pharmacodynamics  of  the  substance.  Risks  for  induction  of  tumours  or 
hyperplasia  in  thymus,  uterus  and  ovaries  in  postmenopausal  women  are considered  small,  but  are 
identified as potential risks in the RMP. In order to better define the potential risks of thymic tumour 
and  endometrial  hyperplasia,  the  Applicant  will  assess  these  potential  risks  in  a  planned  post 
approval safety study (Annex II condition). CHMP also made a Recommendation for the Applicant to 
repeat  the  OECD  208  test  and  to  conduct  the  study  according  to  the  guideline  (please  refer  to  the 
section “Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects”).  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The marketing authorization for Senshio can be granted from a non-clinical point of view. 
However,  to  provide  further  clarity  on  some  issues  of  concern,  the  CHMP  considered  the  following 
Recommendations to be useful: 
Pharmacokinetics 
1.  The  in  vitro plasma protein  binding  data  of  M-1  in  the  non-clinical  species  will  be  provided  post-
authorisation  for  interspecies  comparison  between  non-clinical  species  and  humans.  However  the 
protocol should be adapted; the Applicant is requested to investigate a concentration range, e.g. 50 
to 200 ng/mL for M1. 
2.  The  blood-to-plasma  ratio  data  for  ospemifene  in  monkey  and  rat  and  the  blood-to-plasma  ratio 
for M-1 in rat, monkey and human will be provided post-authorisation. However the protocol should 
be adapted; the Applicant is requested to investigate a concentration range, e.g. 500 to 1200 ng/mL 
for ospemifene and 50 to 200 ng/mL for M1. 
3.  The  Applicant  is  requested  to  investigate  the  CYP  induction  potential  of  ospemifene  at  clinically 
relevant  intestinal  concentrations  to  exclude  potential  CYP3A4  induction  in  the  intestine.  No  CYP 
induction is expected for ospemifene and M-1 at clinically relevant systemic concentrations.  
4.  The Applicant will provide BSEP transporter studies post-marketing.  
5.  It  is  possible  that  ospemifene  and  M-1  are  glucuronidated  in  the  liver  and  deconjugated  in  the 
intestine  in  patients  (as  was  observed  in  the  non-clinical  species).  The  Applicant  is  requested  to 
provide information that this is unlikely to occur or provide information on the UGTs involved in the 
glucuronidation of ospemifene and M-1. 
6.  The Applicant committed to evaluate the inhibition potential of ospemifene and M-1 with regards 
to the UGT enzymes. 
7.  The  Applicant  committed  to  evaluate  the  binding  of  ospemifene  SHBG  and  other  plasma 
circulating proteins in humans. 
8.   The Applicant committed to evaluate and the conversion of the Z-enantiomer of ospemifene to its 
E-enantiomer post marketing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 30/116 
 
  
  
 
9.  The  Applicant  committed  to  evaluate  the  metabolism  and  excretion  of  ospemifene  and  its 
metabolites  using  the  commercial  ospemifene  60  mg  under  fed  conditions  in  a  post-authorization 
study. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
10.  The applicant is requested to repeat the OECD 208 test as the submitted study as it did not fulfil 
the  test  guideline  requirements  with  respect  to  the  number  of  concentrations  tested  and  several 
statistically significant effects that were observed were disregarded as 'not biologically significant'.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Overview of subjects in clinical development programme 
Figure 2 provides an overview on the number of subjects who have been included in clinical trials. In 
the phase 2 and 3 studies, a total of 1,892 postmenopausal subjects, with and without a uterus, were 
exposed to at least one dose of Ospemifene. Of the 1,892 subjects in the phase 2 and 3 trials, 1546 
(approximately 80%) received the 60 mg or higher dose. Among Ospemifene treated subjects, 1370 
had at least 12 weeks exposure, 659 had a least 6 months exposure and 409 subjects had at least 1 
year of exposure, with a maximum exposure of 89 weeks.

Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
During  the  development  of  Ospemifene  several  analytical  methods  were  used  for  the  analysis  of 
Ospemifene, 4-hydroxy Ospemifene (M1) and 4´-hydroxyOspemifene (M2) in human serum, protein 
free supernatant and urine. In the early studies, solid phase extraction followed by high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with post column photo activation and fluorescence detection was used 
for  the  analysis  of  Ospemifene  (and  metabolites)  in  serum.  In  the  more  recent  studies,  LC-MS/MS 
methods  were  used  for  the  analysis  of  Ospemifene  in  serum  and  urine.  Four  different  laboratories 
were  involved  in  the  analysis.  The  analytical  methods  used  in the  PK  studies were  considered to  be 
sufficiently validated and validation reports were provided.

In  the  human  ADME  study  15-50206  a  tritium  labelled  form  of  Ospemifene was  used.  In  this  study 
tritium exchange has been observed.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters and statistics 
The PK parameters of Ospemifene and its metabolites were evaluated in individual studies using non-
compartmental methods. Standard PK parameters were determined and standard statistical analyses 
were carried out. In most studies the pharmacokinetics were summarized with descriptive statistics. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models have been used for comparison of two treatments. 
Absorption  
Absorption and bioavailability 
Ospemifene is a lipophilic drug that has a poor aqueous solubility (<0.4µg/ml). The permeability tests 
with Caco-2 cell monolayers indicated that Ospemifene can be classified as having a high absorption 
potential.  Ospemifene  appears  to  be  slowly  absorbed  by  oral  route  with  t max  reached  3  to  4  hours 
after  administration  under  fed  conditions.  The  onset  of  absorption  is  rapid,  with  measurable  levels 
observed 0.5 to 1 hour post dose. However, the extent of absorption and the absolute bioavailability 
could not be estimated. The Ospemifene Cmax is approximately 800ng/ml and AUC0-τ 5500 ng•hr/mL, 
after  once  daily  repeat  doses  of  60  mg  Ospemifene  in  the  fed  state.  The  main  pharmacokinetic 
parameters of Ospemifene are summarised in table 5.

A  significant  food  effect  was  observed  for  Ospemifene.  Both  the  low-  and  high-fat  breakfasts 
produced  statistically  significant  increases  in  Cmax  and  exposure  of  Ospemifene  and  its  active 
metabolite M-1, when compared to the fasted group. In addition, the variability of the bioavailability 
is also reduced. Food did not affect t max. The Cmax and AUC0-72 h values of Ospemifene were 2.3 and 
1.9  fold  higher  when  concomitant  administration  of  a  low  fat  meal  was  compared  to  fasted 
conditions,  respectively.  The  Cmax  and  AUC0-72  h  values  of  4-hydoxy-Ospemifene  were  both  1.6  fold 
higher under fed conditions. High fat food intake enhances AUC and Cmax by  approximately 3.6 fold 
and 2.8 fold respectively. 
The Applicant did not establish the absolute bioavailability of Ospemifene but this has been reflected 
in the SmPC.

Bioequivalence 
The  Applicant  evaluated  the  suitability  of  a  capsule  formulation  and  two  different  tablets,  in  six 
bioequivalence  studies.  Bioequivalence  was  shown  for  the  Ospemifene  tablets  by  two  DP 
manufacturers  including  the  current  commercial  manufacturer,  Penn  Pharma.  For  the  other  tablet, 
bioequivalence  was  not  shown.  All  pivotal  studies  used  tablets  that  had  been  shown  to  be 
bioequivalent. 
Distribution 
In studies 15-50921, 15-50820 and 15-5092, it was shown that Ospemifene is highly (>99%) bound 
to  serum  proteins  in  healthy  postmenopausal  women,  and  similar  results  were  observed in  patients 
with  renal  and  hepatic  dysfunction.  In  the  ADME  study  15-50206  with  tritium  labeled  Ospemifene, 
the plasma protein binding of total radioactivity was approximately 94%. Binding of Ospemifene and 
4-hydroxy-Ospemifene  was  slightly  higher  than  for  total  radioactivity,  with  mean  values  of 
approximately  98%.  The  binding  of  Ospemifene  to  SHBG  has  not  been  evaluated  –  however,  the 
CHMP  made  a  Recommendation  for  the  Applicant  to  evaluate  this  post-authorisation.  A  minimal 
distribution into red blood cells was shown.  
Despite being extensively bound to serum protein (>99 %), Ospemifene appears to distribute widely 
to  the  extra-vascular  compartment.  Following  oral  administration,  the  mean  apparent  volume  of 
distribution based on terminal phase is 448 L. 
The Applicant has conducted a QWBA study in rats using stable [14C]-Ospemifene. Based on the 24 
hour distribution data found in this pre-clinical study and the calculated half-lives, it can be expected 
that  Ospemifene  accumulation  could  occur  in  humans  in  the  following  organs  following  repeated 
dosing: adrenal gland, haderian gland, spleen, liver, skin, female reproductive organ (ovary, oviduct, 
clitoral  gland),  cervical  lymph  node,  kidney,  fat,  bone  marrow,  and  lung  (refer  to  Non-Clinical 
section). 
Metabolism and elimination 
The apparent elimination half-life of Ospemifene was 25-30 hours. The total clearance by oral route 
(CL/F) is estimated at approximately 10 L/h. At plasma level, Ospemifene is the predominant entity. 
In  the  ADME  studies  it  was  shown  that  Ospemifene  was  mainly  excreted  in  the  faeces  (75%)  after 
oral  administration,  and  approximately  7%  of  the  Ospemifene  radioactivity  was  found  in  urine.  The 
amount  of  unchanged  Ospemifene  that  was  excreted  into  the  faeces  was  39%  of  the  administered 
dose,  and  less  than  0.2%  of  the  Ospemifene  dose  is  excreted  unchanged  in  urine.  In  the  renal 
impairment  study,  hardly  any  Ospemifene  could  be  detected  in  the  urine  samples.  Approximately 
40% of the total radioactivity in plasma could be identified as Ospemifene or one of the metabolites. 
In  vitro  experiments  with  human  liver  microsomes  indicated  that  Ospemifene  primarily  undergoes 
metabolism  by  CYP2C9,  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C19  enzymes.  A  total  of  7  possible  metabolites  were 
detected in  humans  (refer  to  figure  1 in  the  Non-Clinical  section  of  the  report).  The  most  abundant 
metabolite  in  plasma,  representing  ~25%  of  Ospemifene  exposure,  was  M-1  (4-hydroxy 
Ospemifene).  M-2  (4'-hydroxy  Ospemifene),  M-3  (Ospemifene  carboxylic  acid),  M-4  (3-hydroxy 
Ospemifene),  M-8  (4-hydroxy-O-desalkyl  Ospemifene)  and  M-10  (4-hydroxy  Ospemifene  carboxylic 
acid)  were  also  detected  in  plasma.  Their  radioactive  components in  plasma  each  represented  <7% 
of  Ospemifene  exposure.  Glucuroridation  is  considered  a  minor  metabolic  pathway  in  humans.  The 
amounts of Ospemifene and M-1 glucuronides excreted in urine and in faeces are small and represent 
<1% and <5% of the dose administered. 
Ospemifene was not a significant P-gp substrate at clinically relevant systemc concentrations.

Based on the large interaction observed with fluconazole (mainly CYP2C9 inhibitor, weak inhibitor of 
CYP3A4)  and  the  small  effect  of  ketoconazole  (strong  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4),  CYP2C9  should  be 
considered as the major enzyme and CYP3A4 as a minor enzyme.  
The metabolites M1 and M2 are pharmacological active and contribute to the pharmacological effect 
of  Ospemifene  for  approximately  40%.  Therefore  the  biological  activity  of  Ospemifene  (effects  and 
most  adverse  effects)  can  be  attributed  to  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  parent  compound  and  the 
metabolites M1 and M2. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality  
Under  fed  conditions,  an  almost  dose-proportional  increase  of  Cmax  and  AUC0-τ  in  the  dose  range of 
60mg to 240 mg was observed. Following oral administration of Ospemifene under the fasted state, 
Cmax  and  AUC0-t  increased  in  a  less  than  dose-proportional  manner  over  this  dose  range  of  25  to 
200mg  Ospemifene,  due  to  the  low  solubility  of  Ospemifene.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  Ospemifene 
over time do not appear to change. Once daily administration resulted in a 2.1 fold accumulation of 
Ospemifene in serum with an effective half-life of 25 hours. 
Inter-conversion  
The Applicant did not evaluate if the Ospemifene Z-enantiomer can be converted to its E-enantiomer 
in vivo – however, as previously mentioned, the Applicant commited to evaluate the inter-conversion 
of the Z to the E-enantiomer post-marketing. 
Variability 
The  intersubject  variability  of  the  AUC  and  Cmax  was  35%  and  26%  under  fed  conditions  and 
approximately 50% and 52% under fasting conditions and, respectively. The intra-subject variability 
of  the  AUC  and  Cmax  under  fasting  conditions  was  approximately  23%  and  43%,  respectively.  The 
intra-subject variability has not been tested under fed conditions. No individualization of dose or drug 
monitoring is needed. 
Target population 
The Applicant conducted one population PK/PD study to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  Ospemifene  in  the  target  population  under  fed  (analysis  1)  and  fasting 
conditions  (analysis  2).  In  analysis  1,  a  total  of  7503  PK  blood  samples  from  the  8  studies  were 
analysed,  using  standard  population  PK  methods.  The  Applicant  selected  a  two-compartment  model 
with  first-order  absorption  for  the  Population  PK  analysis.  Age,  race,  manufacturing  sites  (Penn 
Pharmaceuticals [Penn] or Manufacturer B) body weight, BMI, ALB, ALT, BILI, CREAT and CLcr were 
tested as a covariate on PK parameters of CL/F.  
The  population  PK  model  appeared  to  predict  the  exposure  to  Ospemifene  in  the  clinical  studies 
properly.  Based  on this  model,  it  was  concluded that  none of  the  tested  covariates  seemed to  have 
any clinically relevant effect on Ospemifene PK. 
Special populations 
In patients with severe renal impairment, the Ospemifene exposure was increased by approximately 
20%,  when  compared  to  healthy  matched  subjects.  The  exposure  to  the  major  metabolites  4-
hydroxy  Ospemifene  and  4´-hydroxy  Ospemifene  increased  by  20%  and  16%,  respectively.  No 
studies were conducted in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency. Based on these data, 
the  Applicant  has  added  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  that  no  dose  adjustment  is  needed  in  patients 
with, moderate or severe renal impairment – this was agreed on by CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 38/116 
 
  
  
Hepatic impairment studies showed that the exposure of Ospemifene was approximately 30% higher, 
and  the  exposure  of  the  main  metabolite  4-hydroxy  Ospemifene  was  approximately  70%  higher  in 
patients  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment,  when  compared  to  healthy  matched  controls. 
Therefore,  no  dosage  adjustment  was  considered  necessary  for  patients  with  mild  to  moderate 
hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  grade  A  or  B).  The  effect  of  severe  hepatic  impairment  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  Ospemifene  has  not  been  studied.  Therefore,  the  use  of  the  drug  in  this 
subgroup of patients should not be recommended. 
The  Applicant  investigated  the  influence  of  age,  weight  and  race  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
Ospemifene, and none of these covariates seemed to affect the Ospemifene pharmacokinetics. In the 
population  PK  study  it  was  found  that  body  weight  was  not  a  significant  covariate  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  Ospemifene  although  it  was  considered  a  possible  statistically  significant 
covariate on  the  apparent  distribution  volume  of  central  compartment  (V2/F).  Based  on these  data, 
no dose recommendations for obese and underweighted patients were considered required. 
Ospemifene  is  not  indicated  in  children  and  adolescents  as  no  PK  data  are  available  in  these  sub-
groups. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential for drug interactions was evaluated in thirteen in vitro studies and six in vivo studies. 
As  was  previously  mentioned,  Ospemifene  is  primarily  metabolised  by  CYP3A4,  CYP2C9  and 
CYP2C19. 
When  Ospemifene  was  co-administered  with  the  strong  CYP2C9  and  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor 
fluconazole, a 2.7 fold increase in exposure was observed. Therefore, fluconazole should not be used 
concomitantly  with  Ospemifene  –  this  was  reflected  in  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC.  This  increase  was 
considered to be due to the inhibition of CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent inhibition of CYP3A involved in 
Ospemifene metabolism and seemed to suggest that co-administration of Ospemifene with drugs that 
inhibit  both  CYP3A  and  CYP2C9  activity  would  be  expected  to  increase  the  drug  exposure  of 
Ospemifene significantly and should be avoided.  
A  mild  increase  of  40%  of  the  Ospemifene  exposure  was  observed  when  Ospemifene  was  co-
administered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. 
The absorption and metabolism of Ospemifene is not affected to a clinically significant degree (17% 
increase of AUC) by co-administration of oral omeprazole, a drug that increases gastric pH and is a 
CYP2C19 inhibitor. 
When  Ospemifene  was  co-administered  with  the  potent  CYP3A4/CYP2C9  inducer  rifampicin,  the 
exposure to Ospemifene decreases by 60% - however, this is not expected to be of clinical relevance. 
Co-administration  of  Ospemifene  with  drugs  that  induce  CYP3A4  or  CYP2C9  activity  would  be 
expected to decrease significantly the drug exposure of Ospemifene, which may decrease the clinical 
effect. 
In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  Ospemifene  inhibited  activities  associated  with  CYP2B6,  CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6, in this order of decreasing potency. Generally, M-1 was a somewhat 
more  potent  inhibitor  than  its  parent  compound  Ospemifene.  The  CYP  induction  potential  of 
Ospemifene was also investigated: at 20 μM (7.6 µg/mL), Ospemifene produced a weak induction of 
CYP2B6-  and  CYP3A4  mediated  activities.  The  peak serum  concentration  in  postmenopausal  women 
after  repeated  daily  administration  of  60  mg  Ospemifene  does  not  exceed  3  μM  or11367  ng/mL, 
peaking  at  approximately  1050  ng/mL.  This  concentration  is  clearly  lower  than  the  concentrations 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 39/116 
 
  
  
inhibiting  the  enzyme-specific  reactions  above.  Therefore,  Ospemifene  was  considered  unlikely  to 
inhibit the metabolism of co-administered drugs metabolised by the hepatic CYP enzymes.  
Ospemifene is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein at a concentration of 10 µM (3.8 µg/mL). No other 
transporter studies were performed with Ospemifene. 
Ospemifene treatment did not affect the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6 and 3A4 activity when evaluated 
using S-warfarin as a CYP2C9 probe substrate, omeprazole as a sensitive CYP2C19 and 3A4 substrate 
and  bupropion  as  sensitive  CYP2B6  substrate,  which  was  consistent  with  the  findings  in  pre-clinical 
studies. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ospemifene (FC-1271a) is an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist/antagonist, commonly referred to as a 
selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that belongs to the substituted triphenyl chloroethane 
class  of  SERM  compounds.  Its  biological  actions  are  mediated  through  binding  to  ERs.  This  binding 
results  in  activation  of  estrogenic  pathways  in  some  tissues  (agonism)  and  blockade  of  estrogenic 
pathways in others (antagonism). The major target organs of the effects of SERMs include mammary 
gland, bone, vagina and uterus. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In addition to the dose-finding study 15-50717 and three Phase III studies (15-50310, 15-50717 and 
15-50310) described in the clinical efficacy section, pharmacodynamic parameters were investigated 
in the following five studies: 
•  15-50842: Thorough QTc study in healthy males and females. 
•  15-06003:  Safety,  tolerability  and  pharmacodynamics  during  repeated  oral  administration  of 
Ospemifene (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/daily) in healthy postmenopausal women. 
•  15-06001:  Effect  of  raloxifene  (60  mg/daily)  and  Ospemifene  (30,  60  and  90  mg/daily)  on 
markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women. 
•  15-06002:  Effect  of  Ospemifene  (30,  60  and  90  mg/daily)  on  bone,  vascular  endothelium, 
lipid metabolism and endometrium in postmenopausal women. 
•  15-50615:  Efficacy  and  safety  of  Ospemifene  in  treatment  of  hot  flashes  in  postmenopausal 
women. 
Effects on the vaginal epithelium 
Findings  on  vaginal  epithelium  are  provided  from  secondary  endpoints  of  the  PD  studies  15-06001 
and 15-06002, as well as from the clinical studies (15-50310, 15-50821 and 15-50718). 
•  Study  15-06003  was  a  repeat-dose  study  in  healthy  postmenopausal  women  evaluating  25, 
50, 100 and 200 mg doses of Ospemifene administered once daily for 12 weeks. There were 10 
subjects  per  dose  level,  8  on  active  drug  and  2  on  placebo.  The  estrogen-like  effect  on  the 
vaginal epithelium was estimated by karyopyknosis index, assessing parabasal cell layer (index

1),  intermediate  cell  layer  (index  2)  and  superficial cell  layer  (index  3).  All  Ospemifene  doses 
differed  significantly  from  placebo  for  the  indices  1  (parabasal  cells)  and  3  (superficial  cells), 
see table 6 below.

•  Study  15-06001  compared  Ospemifene  (30,  60  and  90  mg)  with  raloxifene  (60  mg).  This  12 
week study was conducted in 119 postmenopausal women. In cervical smears, all Ospemifene 
groups  demonstrated  an  estrogenic  effect  on  the  mucous  membranes,  as  reflected  by  the 
percentage  shift  in  Karyopyknosis  Index  (Table  7  below).  Dose  response  could  be  observed 
with  increasing  Ospemifene  dose,  although  this  did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  In 
contrast, the raloxifene group had no effect on the index.

Study 15-06001 
•  Study  15-06002  was  conducted  in  160  post-menopausal  women.  Ospemifene  had  an 
estrogen-like  effect  on  vaginal  epithelium,  as  reflected  by  the  changes  in  the  percentage  of 
cells in the parabasal (Index 1), intermediate (Index 2) and superficial (Index 3) layers (Table 
8  below).  The  difference  between  Ospemifene  and  placebo  was  statistically  significant  in  all 
indices, except for the 30 mg dose in Index 3 (p = 0.097).

Study 15-06002 
Effects on the endometrium 
• 
• 
In study 15-06001 the mean change from Week 12 compared to Baseline was for 30 mg 0.33 
mm, 60 mg 0.43 mm, 90 mg 0.52 mm and raloxifene -0.09 mm. Endometrial biopsies showed 
atrophy in the majority of subjects (83.3% to 95.7% of 12 week samples).  
In study 15-06002 the mean change from Week 12 compared to Baseline was for 30 mg 0.65 
mm,  60  mg  0.52  mm,  90  mg  0.39  mm  and  placebo  -0.04  mm.  Increases  in  the  number  of 
proliferative  changes  were  observed  in  all  Ospemifene  groups.  For  more  details  on  the 
endometrium see the section on Clinical Safety. 
•  No  firm  conclusions  could  be  drawn  on  study  15-06003,  as  the  number  of  women  in  each 
group was small (n=8), and the range was wide. However, a weak dose-dependent estrogenic 
effect was seen on endometrial histology at the 50 mg dose an estrogen effect in one subject, 
and at the 100 and 200 mg doses in two subjects. 
Hormonal assessment 
• 
In  study  15-06002  serum  FSH,  LH,  E2  and  IGF-1  were  measured  at  Screening,  Week  12  and 
Weeks  14-16  in  the  Ospemifene  30  mg,  60  mg  and  90  mg  groups.  The  LH  and  FSH 
concentrations  were  decreased  in  a  dose-related  manner  by  Ospemifene  treatment:  30  mg  -
6.5 IU/l, 60 mg -9.1 IU/l, 90 mg -12.7 IU/l and placebo -1.6 IU/l. Also a dose-related decrease 
was observed in IGF-1 concentrations. Ospemifene treatment did not affect E2 concentrations. 
•  Similarly, in study 15-06001 (60 mg raloxifene and 30 mg, 60 mg and 90 mg Ospemifene) a 
dose-dependent effect was observed for FSH and SHBG. FSH decreased significantly more with 
an  Ospemifene  dose  of  90  mg  than  other  dose  levels  or  raloxifene  60  mg.  SHBG  increased 
significantly more on all three Ospemifene dose levels compared with raloxifene. 
• 
In study 15-06003 investigating 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg Ospemifene, a decrease 
in FSH and LH levels was observed for the 100 and 200 mg/day dose. Ospemifene had no clear 
effect  on  E2  levels  at  the  60  mg  dose,  but  at  high  doses  (200  mg)  estradiol  levels  could 
increase - though it should be remarked that the number of subjects evaluated was very small.

QTc prolongation 
Study  15-50824  was  a  Phase  1  study  designed  to  determine  the  ECG  effects  of  Ospemifene  in 
approximately  200  healthy  male  and  female  subjects,  between  18  and  45  years  of  age.  The  total 
treatment duration was 7 days, and subjects were randomized to receive placebo daily, Ospemifene 
60  mg/day  (the  proposed  therapeutic  dose),  Ospemifene  240  mg/day  (supra-therapeutic  dose),  or 
moxifloxacin  (as  a  positive  control).  The  time-averaged  QTcI  placebo-corrected  mean  changes  from 
baseline for the Ospemifene 60 mg and 240 mg groups were -2.7 and -3.5 ms, respectively (Figure 
3).  Neither  of  the  2  Ospemifene  dose  groups  demonstrated  an  upper  bound  that  approached  or 
exceeded 10 ms. The data did not raise a signal for any QTc-prolonging effect of Ospemifene, nor on 
other ECG parameters, including heart rate, PR or QRS interval. Assay sensitivity was reached in that 
the  placebo-  corrected  QTcI  mean  change  from  baseline  values  for  moxifloxacin  was  +5.4  ms 
(expected 5-10 ms).

Analysis Population 
Effects on bone 
The  effect  of  Ospemifene  activity  on  bone  was  assessed  with  markers  of  bone  formation  and 
reabsorption.  The  pharmacodynamic  studies  (1506001,  1506002  and  1506003)  suggested  an 
agonistic effect on bone.  
In  study  1506001,  Ospemifene  60  and  90  mg  had  in  some  parameters  slightly  better  values  when 
compared  to  raloxifene  60  mg,  but  the  only  significant  difference  was  in  the  concentrations  of  the 
procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) - favouring 90 mg/day Ospemifene. These potential 
beneficial effects of Ospemifene have not been further investigated in clinical Phase 3 studies for an 
indication of osteoporosis. 
Effect on vasomotor symptoms 
A  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  study  15-50615  was  conducted  in  post-menopausal  women  with 
vasomotor symptoms. A total of 198 postmenopausal subjects, aged 40 to 70, with a minimum of 7 
hot  flushes  (moderate,  severe  or  very  severe)  per  day  or  50  per  week,  were  randomized.  For  the 
primary  efficacy  variable  of  change  in  frequency  of  moderate,  severe  and  very  severe  vasomotor

symptoms from Baseline to Week 6, the median decrease was significantly greater (p = 0.004) in the 
Placebo  group  [-27;  CI  -32  to  -17;  Mean  (SD)  -32.8  (51.9)]  compared  to  the  Ospemifene  group  (-
14;  CI  -21  to  -5;  Mean  (SD)  -  10.1  (60.0)].  Also,  for  the  primary  efficacy  variable  of  change  in 
severity  of  moderate,  severe  and  very  severe  vasomotor  symptoms  from  Baseline  to  Week  6,  the 
median decrease was significantly greater in the Placebo group (p = 0.005) [-69; CI -85 to -51, Mean 
(SD)  -93.6  (164.9)]  compared  to  the  Ospemifene  group  [-43;  CI  -64  to  -12;  Mean  (SD)  -20.4 
(214.4)].  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  was  not  considered  to  be  efficacious  in  reducing  the  frequency  or 
severity  of  vasomotor  symptoms  in  post-menopausal  women.  Refer  also  to  section  “Clinical  Safety” 
for the incidence of hot flushes in the Phase III trials. 
Effect on coagulation factors 
In  study  15-06002,  the  following  coagulation/fibrinolysis  parameters  were  assessed:  Fibrinogen, 
F1+2,  TAT,  D-Dimer,  tPA,  Plasminogen  Activator  Inhibitor  (PAI-1).  Ospemifene  demonstrated  a 
lowering  effect  on  fibrinogen  and  PAI-1  and  no  effect  on  other  markers  of  coagulation/fibrinolysis 
F1+2,  TAT,  D-dimer  and  tPA.  The  slight  differences  noted  among  the  list  of  hemostatic  variables 
could not be used to predict the risk of VTE during use of Ospemifene as none of these are validated 
surrogate endpoints for the clinical endpoint of VTE. 
Effect on lipids 
In  study  15-06003,  Ospemifene  treatment  demonstrated  a  decrease  in  serum  LDL  variables  and  an 
increase  in  the  HDL/LDL  ratio  -  representing  a  beneficial  effect  on  lipid  metabolism.  Ospemifene 
reduced serum LH and FSH with the greatest effect at 100 and 200 mg doses at week 12. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The PK/PD analyses from the pooled data from three Phase 3 studies (15-50310, 15-50821 and 15-
50718) did not suggest any meaningful associations between the drug exposures (AUCss or Cmax,ss) 
of Ospemifene and measures of efficacy indices (percent change of parabasal cells at week 12 from 
the baseline, percent change of superficial cells at week 12 from the baseline, change of vaginal pH 
at week 12 from the baseline, and severity of Most Bothersome Symptom [MBS, vaginal dryness or 
vaginal pain associated with sexual activity]) in the exposure range obtained in these studies.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  the  early  studies,  Ospemifene  and  metabolite  concentrations  in  serum  were  determined  using 
HPLC  methods  with  fluorescence  detection;  in  the  more  recent  studies  LC-MS/MS  methods  were 
used.  Because  all  methods  were  sufficiently  validated  and  the  results  of  the  different  studies  were 
more  or  less  comparable,  the  use  of  different  methods  over  time  was  considered  acceptable  by 
CHMP.  No  cross-validation  of  the  different  analytical  methods  used  in  the  PK  development  program 
was carried out. The Applicant developed a PK-population model that included “analytical method” as 
a covariate. Based on the presented population PK data (single dose and multiple dose data), it could 
be  concluded  that  the  analytical  methods  used  in  the  different  studies  did  not  appear  to  have  a 
significant  impact  on  the  pharmacokinetic  results.  Therefore,  CHMP  considered  the  lack  of  cross-
validation of the different analytical methods used in the PK development program could be accepted. 
Due to its intrinsic properties (very low solubility and lipophylic nature), the absorption of Ospemifene 
is  highly  variable  and  dependent  on  food  intake.  The  bioavailability  of  Ospemifene  and  its  major 
metabolite  4-hydroxy-Ospemifene  increases  when  Ospemifene  is  administered  concomitantly  with 
food  -  a  light  meal  enhances  the  BA  of  Ospemifene  slightly  (approximately  10  to  20%),  whereas  a 
high fat meal enhances it in a much more marked  manner (approximately 100%).  In addition, the 
variability  of  the  bioavailability  is  also  reduced  when  Ospemifene  is  administered  with  food. 
Ospemifene  displays  almost  dose-proportional  pharmacokinetics  under  fed  conditions,  in  the  dose 
range  of  60  to  240  mg.  Under  the  fasted  state  Ospemifene  pharmacokinetics  are  less  than  dose-
proportional, indicating that the absorption of Ospemifene is limited due its low solubility. 
In the SmPC the Applicant recommends to take Ospemifene with food – this advice was supported by 
the  submitted  food  effect  studies,  where  administration  with  food  led  to  statistically  significantly 
higher  bioavailability  of  Ospemifene,  and  also  lower  inter-subject  variability  in  drug  exposure  (like 
mentioned  previously).  As  there  were  considerable  differences  between  concomitant  administration 
with a light meal or a high fat meal, it is recommended to take Ospemifene at the same time of the 
day, to keep the nature of food as stable as possible during daily use. The instructions for use are in 
alignment  with  the  instructions  implemented  in  the  pivotal  studies,  and  thus  reflect  the 
administration conditions under which Ospemifene has demonstrated clinical efficacy.  
The Ospemifene Cmax is approximately 800ng/ml and AUC0-τ  5500 ng•hr/mL, after once daily repeat 
doses  of  60  mg  Ospemifene  in  the  fed  state.  Tmax  can  be  found  approximately  3  hours  after 
administration.  Following  attainment  of  the  Cmax  the  concentration  seemed  to  decline  in  a  biphasic 
manner, with multiple peaks apparent and a terminal t1/2  of 25-30 hours. This could be an indication 
of  enterohepatic  cycling  of  Ospemifene.  After  administration  of  multiple  doses  of  Ospemifene  a  2.1 
fold accumulation was observed, which was in line with the observed long half life. 
The  Applicant  conducted  most  bioequivalence  studies  under  fasted  conditions,  which  was  not 
considered  the  most  appropriate  design  for  Ospemifene,  as  its  administration  is  recommended  to 
take place under fed conditions. However, CHMP considered there was no need to repeat the pivotal 
bioequivalence  study  -  which  was  also  conducted  under  fasting  conditions  -  as  the  Applicant  still 
showed bioequivalence despite of the high variability. 
No  investigation  of  the  absolute  BA  of  Ospemifene  was  performed.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the 
lack  of  such  investigation  was  justified  by  the  availability  of  sufficient  data  showing  that  the 
bioavailability of Ospemifene is already complete under fed conditions. Such statement could not be 
endorsed  as  the  relative  bioavailability  under  fed  versus  fasting  conditions  suggests  strongly  that 
solubility is a limiting step in the absorption of the drug. Besides, the outcome of the mass-balance 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 45/116 
 
  
  
study did not lead to any reliable estimation of absolute bioavailability or the absorbed fraction of the 
drug.  However,  as  the  Applicant  reflected  the  lack  of  information  on  the  absolute  BA  in  the  SmPC, 
CHMP did not considered necessary to further pursue this issue. 
Ospemifene is highly (>99%) bound to serum proteins in healthy postmenopausal women and similar 
results  were  also  observed  in  patients  with  renal  dysfunction  and  hepatic  dysfunction.  In  the  ADME 
study,  the  plasma  protein  binding  of  total  radioactivity  was  approximately  94%  and  the  binding  of 
Ospemifene  and  4-hydroxy-Ospemifene  was  approximately  98%.  The  difference  could  possibly  be 
partly explained by the observed tritium exchange in the ADME study.  
The human ADME study 15-50206 was conducted to clarify the extent of radioactivity in plasma and 
excreta.  Although  an  unstable  tritium  label  was  used  the  results  were  probably  likely,  seeing  as 
preclinical studies that were conducted in rats showed that the distribution, metabolism and excretion 
of radioactivity was comparable between stable [14C ]Ospemifene and [3H]Ospemifene. Therefore, it 
could  be  concluded  that  the  [3H]-exchange  in  the  previous  studies  has  probably  not  affected  the 
ADME characterisation of the elimination and metabolism of Ospemifene. 
Only  40%  of  the  radioactivity  could  be  identified  as  Ospemifene  or  one  of  the  metabolites.  In  the 
ADME  studies  it  was  shown  that  after  oral  administration  Ospemifene  was  mainly  excreted  in  the 
faeces (75%), and approximately 7% of the Ospemifene radioactivity was found in urine. Most of the 
Ospemifene  found  in  the  faeces  probably  represents  unabsorbed  Ospemifene.  There  were  no 
adequate  investigations  (direct  comparison  of  BA  under  different  food  status)  with  the  commercial 
formulation.  However,  the  CHMP  made  a  Recommendation  for  the  Applicant  to  evaluate  in  a  post-
authorisation  study  the  metabolism  and  excretion  of  Ospemifene  and  its  metabolites  using  the 
commercial  Ospemifene  60  mg  under  fed  conditions;  the  content  of  the  meal  to  be  coadministered 
with Ospemifene should be representative for the proposed food intake conditions in the SmPC. 
The  binding  of  Ospemifene  to  SHBG  (or  other  plasma  circulating  proteins)  was  not  investigated, 
although  phase  1  and  phase  2  studies  suggested  that  Ospemifene  induces  the  synthesis  of  SHBG. 
Therefore,  time  dependant  PK  of  Ospemifene  could  not  be  excluded.  Considering  that  the  drug  is 
intended  for  long-term  use,  its  main  PKs  features  should  be  clearly  drawn  –  so,  in  order  to  better 
characterize the PKs of Ospemifene, and following the CHMP Recommendation mentioned previously, 
the Applicant will investigate the binding potential to SHBG and other main circulating proteins (HSA 
and AAG).  
The  consequences  of  genetic  polymorphism  on  the  PK  of  Ospemifene  have  not  been  evaluated  in 
clinical  studies.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  interaction  study  with  fluconazole,  the  exposure  to 
Ospemifene  is  expected  to  be  higher  in  patients  that  are  poor  CYP2C9  metabolisers.  Therefore,  a 
warning  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  that  Ospemifene  should  be  avoided  in  patients  who  are 
known  or  suspected  to  be  CYP2C9  poor  metabolisers  (based  on  genotyping  or  previous 
history/experience  with  other  CYP2C9  substrates).  For  these  patients,  it  can  be  expected  that  the 
impact of an interaction with a CYP3A4 inhibitor would be larger.  
Most  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted  in  healthy  postmenopausal  women; 
however,  the  pharmacokinetics  in  women  with  vaginal  atrophy  is  not  expected  to  be  different. 
Furthermore,  a  population  pharmacokinetic  study  was  conducted 
to  characterise 
the 
pharmacokinetics in the postmenopausal women. Based on this study it can be concluded that none 
of  the  tested  covariates  (age,  race,  manufacturing  sites  (Penn  Pharmaceuticals  [Penn]  or 
Manufacturer  B)  body  weight,  BMI,  ALB,  ALT,  BILI,  CREAT  and  CLcr)  seemed  to  have  any  clinically 
relevant effect on Ospemifene PK. However, the ability to assess the test all covariates appropriately 
is limited as some subgroups were rather small (e.g. only 21 women >75years and 12 Asian women 
were included). 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015

A  slightly  higher  exposure  to  Ospemifene  and  the  M1  and  M2  metabolite  was  observed  in  patients 
with severe renal impairment when  compared to healthy matched subjects – however, this was not 
expected to have any clinical consequences. 
Although  Ospemifene  is  primarily  metabolised  by  the  liver,  the  two  hepatic  impairment  studies 
showed  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Ospemifene  are  only  slightly  affected  by  mild  and  moderate 
hepatic impairment  when compared  to  healthy  matched  controls.  In  patients with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment,  the  exposure  of  Ospemifene  and  M1  was  approximately  30%  and  70%  higher, 
respectively. This higher exposure was not thought to be clinically relevant. 
Concomitant  administration  of  fluconazole  resulted  in  a  possibly  relevant  2.7  fold  increase  of  the 
Ospemifene  exposure  and  inhibition  of  the  formation  of  the  active  metabolite  M1  (M1  Cmax  was 
delayed and decreased by 35%) – therefore, it was expected the PD effect of this interaction would 
be less pronounced than predicted based on PK data of the parent only. 
The  potential  of  Ospemifene  to inhibit  and  induce  CYP  enzymes  has  been  evaluated  mainly in  vitro. 
Based  on  these  in  vitro  data  it  was  considered  unlikely  that  Ospemifene  will  affect  hepatic  CYP 
metabolism. Weak induction of CYP2B6- and CYP3A4 mediated activities was observed - this could be 
relevant  for  the  gastrointestinal  CYP  metabolism.  In  in  vitro  CYP3A4  assays  it  was  shown  that 
Ospemifene does not affect the metabolism of midazolam or testosterone. 
In  clinical  studies  Ospemifene  treatment  did  not  affect  the  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2B6  and  3A4 
activity  when  evaluated  using  S-warfarin  as  a  CYP2C9  probe  substrate,  omeprazole  as  a  sensitive 
CYP2C19 and 3A4 substrate and bupropion as sensitive CYP2B6 substrate.  
Omeprazole  was  not  accepted  as  a  probe  drug to investigate the  interaction  with  CYP3A4, although 
the  conversion  of  omeprazole  to  omeprazole  sulfone  is  exclusively  mediated  by  CYP3A4  and 
underestimation  of  Ospemifene  induction  potential  cannot  be  excluded.  The  Applicant  is  going  to 
conduct  an  additional  drug-drug  interaction  study  (PAS)  with  midazolam,  which  is  considered  an 
acceptable CYP 3A4 substrate. This study is reflected in the RMP. 
The  in  vitro  transporter  studies  that  were  submitted  to  were  not  acceptable  (for  details  see  Non-
Clinical part of the AR). 
The  Applicant  will  evaluate  the  inhibition  potential  of  Ospemifene  and  M-1  with  regards  to  the  UGT 
enzymes post-marketing. If in vitro data indicate potential UGT inhibition, clinically relevance should 
be investigated.  
Based  on  the  absorption  characteristics  and  the  lipophilic  nature  of  Ospemifene,  it  can  be  expected 
that  drugs  that  are  used  to  decrease  fat  absorption  like  orlistat  (anti-obesity  drug)  can  affect  the 
absorption.  The  possibility  of  a  potential  drug–drug  interaction  between  Ospemifene  and  orlistat 
cannot be ruled out and so a warning regarding this interaction was added in the SmPC. 
The mechanisms of action of aromatase inhibitors and Tamoxifen may prevent concomitant use with 
Ospemifene and therefore a contraindication and warning were also included in the SmPC. 
Finally,  as  mentioned  in  the  Non-Clinical  section,  the  company  will  follow  a  CHMP  Recommendation 
and evaluate the conversion of the Z-enantiomer of Ospemifene to its E-enantiomer post approval. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In contrast to the SERM raloxifene, an estrogen effect was observed on the vaginal epithelium for all 
Ospemifene groups in study 15-06001 (30, 60 and 90 mg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 47/116 
 
  
  
 
In study 15-06002 a statistically significant improvement in vaginal epithelium compared to placebo 
was observed for the 60 mg and 90 mg groups, where an increase in superficial cells and a decrease 
in parabasal cells was seen; the 30 mg group did not reach statistical significance for an increase in 
superficial cells. These data were in support of the chosen dose of 60 mg Ospemifene, although the 
difference in effect between the 30 mg and 60 mg dose was not very large. 
Hormonal  assessment  noted  a  dose-dependent  decrease  in  LH  and  FSH  concentrations,  which 
demonstrated  an  estrogen-like  effect  on  the  hypothalamic-hypophysis  axis.  Also,  a  dose-dependent 
increase was observed on SHBG levels. E2 concentrations were not affected at the 60 mg dose, but 
at high dose (200 mg) estradiol levels may increase. 
The  two  pharmacodynamic  studies  –  studies  15-06001  and  15-06002  -  showed  an  increase  in  the 
endometrium thickness – 0.33 to 0.65 mm. Although a dose-dependent effect was observed in study 
15-06001 (30, 60, 90 mg), this was not the case for study 15-06002 (30, 60, 90 mg). In addition, in 
study  15-06002  increases  in  the  number  of  proliferative  changes  were  observed  in  all  Ospemifene 
groups  compared  to  placebo.  No  cystic  structures  were  observed,  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  SERM 
Lasofoxifene (EPAR Fablyn). 
The pharmacodynamic studies (15-06001, 15-06002 and 15-06003) suggested an agonistic effect on 
bone, though these potential beneficial effects have not been investigated in clinical Phase 3 studies 
for an indication osteoporosis. 
Study 15-50824 was designed to determine the ECG effects of Ospemifene. The data did not show a 
signal  for  any  QTc-prolonging  effect  of  Ospemifene,  which  is  in  contrast  with  Toremifene  (SmPC 
Toremifene). 
Ospemifene  was  studied  in  15-50615  in  post-menopausal  women  with  vasomotor  symptoms. 
Ospemifene  60  mg/day  was  not  efficacious  in  reducing  the  frequency  or  severity  of  vasomotor 
symptoms in post-menopausal women. 
The slight differences noted among the list of hemostatic variables could not  be used to predict the 
risk  of  VTE  during  use  of  Ospemifene,  as  none  of  these  are  validated  surrogate  endpoints  for  the 
clinical  endpoints  of  VTE.  However,  the  Applicant  committed  to  conduct  a  PASS-study  that  follows 
thromboembolic  events  to  determine  the  actual  thromboembolic  risk  of  Ospemifene  60  mg/daily 
(Annex II condition). 
The PK/PD analyses from the pooled data from three Phase III studies (15-50310, 15-50821 and 15-
50718) did not suggest any meaningful associations between the drug exposures (AUCss or Cmax,ss) 
of Ospemifene and measures of efficacy indices (percent change of parabasal cells, percent change of 
superficial  cells,  change  of  vaginal  pH,  and  severity  of  Most  Bothersome  Symptom  in  the  exposure 
range obtained in these studies.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In general, CHMP considers the pharmacokinetics of Ospemifene in postmenopausal women to have 
been sufficiently characterised.  
There  were  some  minor deficiencies  noted,  for  which  the  Applicant  committed  to  conduct  additional 
post-authorisation  studies  (refer  to  sections  to  the  Conclusions  on  Non-Clinical  aspects  for  further 
details).  For  all  these  studies  an  adequate  study  protocol  synopsis  was  submitted  and  only  for  one 
study some changes to the protocol were recommended by CHMP and agreed with by the Applicant.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The  extensive  clinical  programme  included  several  well-conducted  pharmacodynamic  studies  to 
assess primary and secondary pharmacology. The pharmacodynamics profile is expected for a SERM 
with agonistic and antagonistic estrogenic effects depending on the tissue. 
Ospemifene did not result in QTc prolongation, in contrast to the SERM Toremifene (Fareston SmPC). 
Further, in contrast to the SERM lasofoxifene (EPAR Fablyn) no cystic changes were observed in the 
endometrium, which is a favourable finding. 
The  data  of  studies  15-06001  and  15-06002,  showing  that  the  estrogen  effect  on  the  vaginal 
epithelium  was  more  pronounced  in  the  60  and  90  mg  group  (in  comparison  with  30  mg)  are  in 
support of the chosen dose of 60 mg Ospemifene - although the difference in effect between the 30 
mg and 60 mg dose was not very large. 
It is important to remark, however, that as endometrial safety is an issue of concern, the Applicant 
commited  to  undertake  a  post-authorisation  safety  study  that  will  address  this  matter  (Annex  II 
condition).  Endometrial  safety  will  be  addressed  in  further  detail  on  the  section  regarding  Clinical 
Safety. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
In support of the efficacy of Ospemifene for the treatment of VVA, four double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical studies were submitted (Tables 9.1 and 9.2): 
•  One Phase 2, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study to 
assess the minimum effective dose of Ospemifene on objective measures of VVA: Study 15-
50717 
•  Three Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center 
studies: 
−  Two 12-week studies: Studies 15-50310 and 15-50821  
−  One 52-week study: Study 15-50718

2.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Modified ITT population analyses 
An additional ‘Modified ITT’ population was defined in order to analyze the efficacy data for the pivotal 
studies including  only  subjects  who  met  the inclusion  criteria  for  percent  superficial  cells,  vaginal pH, 
and  MBS.  The  Modified  ITT population  included  ITT subjects  who  had  ≤5% superficial  cells  in  the 
maturation index of the vaginal smear at Baseline (defined as the last value taken prior to or on Study 
Day  1),  a  vaginal  pH >5.0  at  Baseline,  and  moderate  or  severe  vaginal  dryness  or  vaginal  pain 
associated  with  sexual  activity  at  Randomization  that  was  designated  as  the  most  bothersome  VVA 
symptom (Study 15-50821, Dryness Stratum and Dyspareunia Stratum, respectively), or at least one 
moderate  or  severe  symptom  of  VVA  that  was  designated  as  most  bothersome  at  Randomization 
(Study 15-50310). Overall, mITT results were similar to that seen with ITT population. 
Gender, Race, Age  
Change  from  Baseline  to  Week 12  in  the  primary  endpoints  of  the  four  Phase 2  and  Phase 3  clinical 
studies of Ospemifene in VVA was analyzed by subgroups. 
The  subgroups  were  age  (<65 years,  ≥65 years),  race  (white,  black,  other),  uterine  status  (intact 
uterus, Yes/No), prior history of vaginal birth (Yes/No), and previous HRT use (within 6 months prior to 
first dose of study drug, Yes/No).  
Overall,  in  the  subgroup  analyses  of  the  effect  of  age,  race,  vaginal  birth  or previous  HRT  use,  there 
were no significant differences in the efficacy of Ospemifene among categories within subgroups for the 
endpoints of percentage of parabasal cells, percentage of superficial cells, vaginal pH or severity of the 
most bothersome VVA symptom of vaginal dryness and vaginal pain associated with sexual activity.  
Uterus status  
Uterine status (subjects with and without an intact uterus) was chosen as a subgroup because it was 
unknown whether uterine secretions contribute significantly to the efficacy response to Ospemifene. 
Study population in study 15-50310 was stratified by uterine status. 
In  pooled  analyses  of  clinical  trials,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  an  intact  uterus  (55.7%  to  90.9%) 
across  treatment  groups,  with  the  exception  of  the  Ospemifene  30  mg/day  group  in  which  50%  of 
subjects  had  an  intact  uterus,  and  50%  did  not.  Overall,  the  efficacy  of  Ospemifene  on  the  four 
primary endpoints was not significantly different among uterine status categories.  
None of the subgroup analyses showed any findings of relevance that were different from the findings 
of the primary analyses in the overall study populations. 
Lubricant effect analysis 
The  clinical  studies  investigated  the  effect  of  lubricant  use  on  efficacy  outcomes,  as  secondary 
endpoints in studies 15-50310 and 15-50821.  
Studies  15-50310  and  15-50821  collected  lubricant  use  data  differently;  subjects  in  Study  15-50310 
recorded lubricant applications per week in a weekly diary with checkboxes of “None”, “1-2 times”, and 
“3 or  more  times”,  whereas  subjects  in  Study  15-50821  recorded  whether  or  not  lubricant  was  used 
each day in a daily diary. 
There  was  a  trend  toward  a  lower  percentage  of  women  reporting  lubricant  use  in  the  Ospemifene 
60 mg/day group compared to placebo. The percentage of women who reported vaginal lubricant use 
decreased  slightly  more  in  the  60  mg  Ospemifene  group  as  compared  with  placebo  after  3  weeks  of 
treatment and over the 12 week study duration.

2.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-
analysis) 
Change in Maturation Index of Vaginal Epithelium: Parabasal cells 
In  each  study,  the  changes  from  Baseline  to  Week  12/LOCF  in  the  percentage  of  parabasal  cells  in 
the  Ospemifene  30  mg/day  and  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  groups  were  significantly  different  from 
placebo, indicating greater improvement at Week 12 in the percentage of parabasal cells for subjects 
in the Ospemifene 30 mg/day, and 60 mg/day groups (Figure 4).

Change in Maturation Index of Vaginal Epithelium: Superficial cells 
In  each  study,  the  changes  from  Baseline  to  Week 12/LOCF  in  the  percentage  of  superficial  cells  in 
the  Ospemifene  30  mg/day  and  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  groups  were  significantly  different  from 
placebo, indicating greater improvement at Week 12 in the percentage of superficial cells for subjects 
in the Ospemifene 30 mg/day, and 60 mg/day groups (Figure 5).

Change in Vaginal pH 
The  changes  from  Baseline  to  Week  12/LOCF  in  vaginal  pH  in  the  Ospemifene  30  mg/day  and 
Ospemifene  60  mg/day  groups  were  significantly  different  from  placebo,  indicating  greater 
improvement at Week 12 in vaginal pH for subjects in both Ospemifene groups. In pooled analyses, 
there  was  statistically  significant  improvement  in  pH  in  the  60  mg/day  group  compared  to  the  30 
mg/day group (Figure 6).

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Four  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  efficacy  of 
Ospemifene  for  the  treatment  of  VVA,  one  Phase  2  (Study  15-50717)  and  three  Phase  3  studies 
(studies 15-50310, 15-50821 and 15-50718).  
From  the  three  main  studies,  studies  15-50310  and  15-50821  were  considered  the  most  important 
for efficacy. For the double-blind long-term (52 weeks) study 15-50718, the main objective was long-
term safety, however also long-term efficacy data were collected.  
Conducting  placebo-controlled  studies  for  the  indication  VVA  are  in  line  with  the  FDA  Guidance 
document ‘Estrogen and Estrogen/Progestin Drug Products to Treat Vasomotor Symptoms and Vulvar 
and  Vaginal  Atrophy  Symptoms’.  This  was  acceptable  since  at  the  time  of  Opinion  there  was  no 
guideline in the EU, and FDA requirements have been accepted previously for products for vulvar and 
vaginal  atrophy. Ospemifene  was  not  registered in Europe  at  the time  of  this  report,  and  for  a  new 
molecular  entity  two  placebo-controlled  phase  3  clinical  trials  are  recommended  to  establish  safety 
and efficacy - according to the FDA Guidance document. These requirements were fulfilled. 
Lack of comparator group 
No active-comparator group (meaning alternative VVA- treatment group) was included in any phase 
2/3  studies.  So,  in  response  to  Day  120  LOQ  and  Day  180  LoOI,  the  Applicant  provided  an  indirect 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 65/116 
 
  
  
 
 
comparison  between  Ospemifene  and  local  estrogens  (a.o.  Vagifem  10  µg,  vaginal  estradiol 
preparations).  
Dose-finding study 
The  dose-finding  study  15-50717  studying  5  mg/day,  15  mg/day  and  30  mg/day  Ospemifene  was 
performed ‘a posteriori’. Although this could be accepted, it would have been more logical to perform 
this study before the Phase 3 studies 15-50310, 15-50821 and 15-50781. 
Inclusion – and exclusion criteria 
Overall,  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  acceptable,  and  in  accordance  with  the  FDA 
Guidance  document  for  studies  15-50310  and  15-50821.  For  studies  15-50717  and  15-50718, 
however, the enrolment criteria did not include the parameter “most bothersome symptom of VVA”. 
This parameter should have been included to be in line with the claimed indication. 
Co-primary endpoints 
The four co-primary efficacy endpoints for studies 15-50310 and 15-50821 were in accordance with 
the FDA Guidance document. 
However,  in  studies  15-50717  and  15-50718,  the  co-primary  endpoint  “mean  change  from  baseline 
to Week 12 in the moderate to severe symptom that has been identified by the patients as being the 
MBS to her” was not included. It would have been preferred to include this co-primary endpoint also 
in  the  European  study  15-50718,  as  there  were  no data  at  the  time  of  the  report on  the  change  in 
MBS  in  the  European  population.  However,  a  recent  international  survey  (Nappi  and  Kokot-Kierepa 
2010)  has  shown  that  subjects  from  various  European  countries  are  not  essentially  different  from 
those in the USA or Canada with regard to issues related to vaginal atrophy. Therefore, the effect of 
Ospemifene on MBS in European patients was very likely to be comparable to that seen in subjects of 
the studies performed in the USA. 
Secondary endpoints 
A subject was considered a responder if all the following criteria were met: 
1) Maturation value increased by at least 10 from Baseline (Screening); 
2) Vaginal pH decreased by at least 0.5 from Baseline (Screening); 
3) MBS improved (decreased in severity) by at least 1 point from Baseline (Randomization). 
As requested in the Day 120 LOQ, the clinical relevance of this responder definition was discussed by 
the Applicant.  
-  A  change  in  1-point  improvement  (0=None,  1=Mild,  2=Moderate,  3=Severe)  was  chosen  as 
clinically  relevant,  as  it  is  perceived  by  the  patient  as  an  improvement,  which  was  considered 
acceptable.  
-  The  change  in  pH  of  0.5  and  improvement in  the  maturation  value  by  10  were  selected during 
discussions  with  the  FDA  based  on  a  change  that  is  unlikely  to  be  due  to  chance  alone,  which 
was also considered acceptable.  
Further, the other secondary endpoints could be used in support of the co-primary endpoints. 
Non-hormonal lubricant as needed 
The  use  of  lubricant  in  both  groups  could  make  it  more  difficult  to  reach  statistical  significant 
difference in MBS. In contrast, the European study 15-50718 was performed in accordance with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 66/116 
 
  
  
 
 
initial  study  design,  i.e.  without  lubricant  use  in  the  screening  period  and  the  first  12  weeks  of  the 
study. 
Statistical methods and sample size 
In  general,  the  statistical  methods  used  were  adequately  described  and  considered  acceptable.  To 
replace missing values for the efficacy analyses, the LOCF approach was used.  
Number of centers 
The number of centers in study 15-50821 was considered high in relation to the number of subjects 
included. There were a lot of centers with a low number of subjects. This necessitated pooling centers 
into  clusters.  The  pooling  was  performed  prior  to  breaking  the  blinding  and  was  based  on 
geographical location. This was considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-finding study 15-50717 
Both  the  15  mg/day  and  30  mg/day  dose  showed  statistical  significance  for  the  primary  efficacy 
variables, i.e. percentage of parabasal cells, percentage of superficial cells and vaginal pH, compared 
to placebo. The 5 mg/dose was not statistically significantly different from placebo, and thus could be 
considered  ineffective.  The  FDA  Guidance  document  recommends  that  studies  identify  the  lowest 
effective  dose  by  including  an  ineffective  dose  as  one  of  the  doses  evaluated  -  this  was  thereby 
fulfilled. Based on these results, the Applicant’s choice to include 30 mg/day as the lowest dose in the 
phase III study 15-50310, in addition to a higher dose of 60 mg/day, could be supported. 
Demographics, gynaecological history and baseline characteristics  
No clinically relevant differences were observed in the demographic characteristic (see also Table 15 
in the following section regarding Clinical Safety), gynaecological history and baseline characteristics 
between treatment groups in the four placebo-controlled studies, nor between the two strata in study 
15-50821. 
Co-primary efficacy analyses 
In  study  15-50310,  both  30  mg/day  and  60  mg/day  showed  statistical  superiority  compared  to 
placebo  in  the  ITT  population  for  the  co-primary  endpoints  percentage  parabasal  cells,  percentage 
superficial  cells,  vaginal  pH  and  MBS  vaginal  dryness.  For  the  MBS  vaginal  pain  associated  with 
sexual  activity,  only  the  higher  dose  of  60  mg/day  Ospemifene  showed  superiority.A  dose-response 
effect was seen with the largest difference for the 60 mg/day Ospemifene dose compared to placebo. 
The PP population showed similar results.

Also  study  15-50821  showed  for  60  mg/day  statistical  significance  for  percentage  parabasal  cells, 
percentage  superficial  cells  and  vaginal  pH  for  both  the  Dryness  Stratum  and  the  Dyspareunia 
Stratum.  In  line  with  study  15-50310,  for  the  MBS  vaginal  pain  associated  with  sexual  activity 
statistical  significant  superiority  was  also  shown  compared  to  placeboAlthough  statistical  significant 
superiority  was  not  met  for  the  MBS  vaginal  dryness,  a  trend  was  observed  in  favour  of  Ospemifene 
compared  to  placebo.  In  response  to  the  Day  120  LoQ,  the  Applicant  adequately  justified  that  the 
improvement  over  placebo  noted  for  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  could  be  considered  clinically 
relevant,  and  that  the  degree  of  improvement  observed  with  Ospemifene  versus  placebo  was 
comparable to that observed with Vagifem 10 µg versus placebo. 
Further,  the  Applicant  performed  an  additional  descriptive  analysis  on  the  primary  endpoint  outcome 
based on the medical literature (Ettinger et al, 2008) and discussions with leading European clinicians 
The proportion of subjects with clinically relevant MBS outcomes (vaginal dryness and dyspareunia) at 
Week  12  (see  Table  15  below)  supported  that  suggested  that  not  only  more  patients  report  benefit 
with  Ospemifene  compared  to  placebo,  but  also  the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  was  greater  for 
Ospemifene.

•  The  change  from  baseline  to  Week  4  was  supportive  of  the  co-primary  endpoints.  An  effect  was 
already observed at Week 4. In studies 15-50310 and 15-50821, a statistical significant difference 
was  reached  for  percentage  parabasal  cells,  percentage  superficial  cells  and  vaginal  pH  The 
change  in  MBS  did  show  a  trend  in  favour  of  the  Ospemifene  groups,  though  it  was  not 
statistically significant in both studies at Week 4. 
• 
In  the  secondary  endpoint  FSFI  a  difference  was  seen  in  pain  with  a  better  score  in  the 
Ospemifene  group  compared  to  placebo,  which  is  in  line  with  the  difference  observed  in  the  co-
primary  endpoint  MBS  vaginal  pain  associated  with  sexual  activity  at  Week  12.  However,  the 
difference was only small. 
Long-term effect 
After  52  weeks  in  study  15-50718,  a  statistically  significant  effect  was  maintained  in  vaginal  pH, 
percentage of parabasal cells and percentage of superficial cells - however, MBS was not included in 
this study.  
Pooled data of four placebo-controlled efficacy studies 
The  pooled  data  showed  a  similar  effect  to  the  one  observed  in  the  pivotal  efficacy  study  used  for 
registration  of  Vagifem  10  for  the  indication  ‘vaginal  atrophy’  in  terms  of  improvement  in  parabasal 
cells, superficial cells and vaginal pH.

In addition, in response to the D120 LoQ the Applicant identified another relevant study with Vagifem 
10  µg  (Bachmann  et  al.,  2008).The  data  show  that  the  efficacy  of  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  is 
comparable to Vagifem 10 µg (refer to figures 7 to 9).

The published efficacy and safety data were not of the same quality for vaginally applied oestriol and 
promestriene, as for Vagifem 10 µg, but the Applicant compared the available published data to the 
Ospemifene data. CHMP considered the degree of improvement of Ospemifene versus placebo to be 
comparable  to  the  degree  of  improvement  versus  placebo  observed  for  vaginally  applied 
promestriene and oestriol (refer to Figures 10 and 11).

2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The placebo-controlled studies had a good design and were conducted according to the FDA Guidance 
document.  
Although the 30 mg/day dose also showed superiority for vaginal pH, percentage of superficial cells 
and  percentage  of  parabasal  cells  compared  to  placebo  in  study  15-50310,  the  effect  of  the  60 
mg/day dose was 1.4-fold larger for the change in superficial and parabasal cells and 1.5-fold larger 
for the change in vaginal pH. Moreover, when looking at the percentage of responders (defined as 1) 
Maturation  value  increased  by  at  least  10  from  Baseline;  2)  Vaginal  pH  decreased  by  at  least  0.5 
from Baseline; 3) MBS improved by at least 1 point from Baseline), the responder-rate was higher for 
60 mg Ospemifene (33.7%) compared to 30 mg Ospemifene (20.6%). 
For  the  MBS  vaginal  pain  associated  with  sexual  activity,  statistical  significant  superiority  was  also 
demonstrated for Ospemifene 60 mg/day, compared to placebo. In contrast, although a strong trend 
was  observed  for  the  MBS  vaginal  dryness,  no  statistical  significant  superiority  was  reached.  It 
should,  however,  be  taken  into  account  that  in  both  15-50310  and  15-50821  studies  the  use  of  a 
lubricant  was  allowed  as  needed,  which  could  make  it  more  difficult  to  establish  a  statistically 
significant  difference  compared  with  placebo  with  regard  to  MBS  vaginal  dryness.  The  efficacy  of 
Ospemifene 60 mg/day was supported by the responder analysis, where significant larger proportion 
of responders was observed in both pivotal trials in the Ospemifene 60 mg/day group versus placebo. 
Also,  in  trial  15-50821,  both  in  the  vaginal  dryness  stratum  (33.8%  for  Ospemifene  and  7.1%  for 
placebo)  and  as  in  the  vaginal  pain  associated  with  sexual  activity  stratum  (42.9%  for  Ospemifene 
and 4.6% for placebo), a significant higher proportion of responders was identified in the Ospemifene 
group versus placebo.  
Considering  that  a  direct comparison  between  a  systemic  and  local  administration  of  estrogens  was 
not  included  in  the  clinical  development,  the  Applicant  provided  indirect  comparison  data  of 
Ospemifene  vs  local  estrogens  treatment  referring  to  two  publications  on  the  use  of  Vagifem  10  µg 
versus placebo (Simon et al 2008 and Bachmann et al 2008). Based on the Applicant’s analysis of the 
data,  the  degree  of  improvement  observed  with  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  versus  placebo  was 
considered  comparable  to  the  degree  of  improvement  of  Vagifem  10  µg,  oestriol  (vaginally  applied 
0.005%  oestriol  gel,  0.03  mg  oestriol,  0.2  mg  oestriol)  and  promestriene  (10  mg  vaginal  capsule 
administered daily) versus placebo. It was sufficiently demonstrated that the efficacy of Ospemifene 
versus placebo is comparable to the efficacy of local estrogens versus placebo. 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  effect  of  age,  race,  vaginal  route  of  birth,  or  previous  HRT  use,  did  not 
show significant differences in the efficacy of Ospemifene among categories within subgroups for the 
endpoints  of  percentage  of  parabasal  cells,  percentage  of  superficial  cells,  vaginal  pH  or  severity  of 
the  most  bothersome  VVA  symptom  of  vaginal  dryness  and  vaginal  pain  associated  with  sexual 
activity. Therefore, no subgroup could be identified in which the benefit/risks is likely to be different 
than that of local estrogens. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  assessment  of  Ospemifene  was  based  on  30  studies,  which  included  21  Phase  1 
studies and 9 Phase 2/3 studies.

Patient exposure 
2471  study  participants  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Ospemifene.  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  clinical 
studies  included  1583  subjects  with  signs  and  symptoms  of  VVA,  as  well  as  309  postmenopausal 
female  volunteers  with  or  without  vasomotor  symptoms  associated  with  menopause.  Treatment 
ranged  from  six  weeks  to  64  weeks  in  duration  and  evaluated  doses  of  Ospemifene  varying  from  5 
mg/day  to  90  mg/day.  Four  placebo-controlled  Phase  2/3  studies  included  the  intended  patient 
population with signs and symptoms of VVA (Table 16).

Considering  only  the  double  blind  placebo  controlled  (DBPC)  phase  2/3  studies,  1242  subjects 
received 60 mg/day Ospemifene with a median duration of exposure to Ospemifene 60 mg of 86 (1, 
395) days. The duration of most of these studies was minimum 12 weeks. Of the Ospemifene 60 mg 
subjects,  384  subjects  had  at  least  24  weeks  of  exposure,  353  subjects  had  at  least  48  weeks  of 
exposure, and 191 subjects had at least 52 weeks of exposure. 
Data regarding long-term safety of Ospemifene 60 mg was considered limited, as only 384 subjects 
were  given  Ospemifene 60  mg  for  more  than  6  months  and  191  subjects  for  more  than  12  months 
(DBPC phase 2/3 studies).  
Participants  were  all  post-menopausal  women.  The majority  of  subjects  were 55  to  64  years of  age 
(57%  Ospemifene  and  59%  placebo),  with  the  median  age  in  the  overall  groups  being  59.0  years. 
The proportion of black or African American women and percentage of subjects from other ethnicity 
was low compared to white subjects (with 93% Ospemifene subjects and 91% placebo subjects being 
white). 
A  total  of  396  subjects  participating  in  the  DBPC  phase  2/3  studies  had  a  BMI  ≥30  kg/m2, 
representing  14.92%  of  the  study  population.  There  was  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of  obese

subjects  in  the  placebo  group:  16.8%  compared  to  13.85%  in  the  Ospemifene  group  but  overall 
height, weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were similar across all groups.  
Table 17 includes detailed data on subject demographics from Phase 2/3 studies with Ospemifene:

Adverse events 
A  total  of  1291/1892  subjects  (68.2%)  in  the  all  Phase  2/3  grouping  reported  at  least  1  TEAE 
compared with 1118/1696 (65.9%) in the DBPC group and 518/958 subjects (54.1%) in the placebo 
group  (Table  18).  This  difference  between  groups  might  have  been  in  part  due  to  the  greater 
duration of exposure for the Ospemifene-treated subjects.

Table 18: Overview of Adverse Events: Phase 2/3 Studies 
A breakdown of TEAEs by dose is provided in Table 19. 
Table  19:  Overview  of  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events:  Double-blind,  Phase  2/3, 
Placebo-Controlled Studies by Dose 
The  most  common  treatment-related  (drug-related)  TEAEs  (Table  20)  reported  by  patients  that 
participated  in  all  of  the  DBPC  Phase  2/3  studies  and  who  received  Ospemifene  were:  hot  flushes 
(7.5% for Ospemifene and 2.6% for placebo); vaginal discharge (3.7% for Ospemifene and 0.3% for 
placebo); and headache (3.1% for Ospemifene and 2.4% for placebo). 
There was no clear dose-related increase in TEAEs for any of the most common TEAEs considered to 
be  related  to  treatment,  with  similar  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  for  Ospemifene 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015

≤15 mg/day,  30 mg/day,  60 mg/day,  and  90 mg/day.  There  was  no  increase  in  ADRs  between  the 
30 mg and 60 mg Ospemifeme groups (similar proportions of subjects reporting ADRs). However, as 
the  population  size  was  imbalanced  in  the  different  treatment  groups,  no  firm  conclusions  could  be 
drawn regarding the relation between ADR incidence and the administered dose.  
Table 20: Summary of Number (%) of Treatment-Related Adverse Events in ≥1% of All 
Ospemifene-treated Subjects: Phase 2/3 Studies 
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) 
For  the  TEAE  of  UTI,  higher  percentages  of  subjects  experienced  this  TEAE  from  4  weeks  to  <12 
weeks  (46/1800  subjects  [2.6%]  and  19/925  subjects  [2.1%],  respectively)  and  from  12  weeks  to 
<26  weeks  (30/1370  subjects  [2.2%]  and  11/568  subjects  [1.9%],  respectively)  than  during  the 
preceding duration intervals. This was likely associated with the urine dipstick testing being done at 4 
weeks and 12 weeks. When all infective events relating to infections of the urinary tract were taken 
into  account,  there  are  no  differences  over  time  with  placebo  and  DBPC  Phase  2/3  Ospemifene 
groups. 
Vulvovaginal signs and symptoms 
In  the  DBPC  study  grouping,  5.4%  of  60  mg  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  experienced  a  TEAE  of 
vulvovaginal infection and 2.6% of placebo subjects. None of these AEs led to discontinuation in the 
Ospemifene- treatment group.  
Vaginal discharge was consistently higher in the Ospemifene group compared to the placebo group: 
3.8%  60  mg  Ospemifene,  3.7% 30  mg  Ospemifene  and  0.3%  placebo.  The  Applicant  indicated  that 
the  recording  of  the  event  of  vaginal  or  genital  discharge  did  not  appear  to  differentiate  between 
physiological  and  pathological  discharge.  Further,  the  Applicant  indicated  that  it  could  be  expected 
that  if  Ospemifene  increases  the  number  of  superficial  cells  and  reduces  the  number  of  parabasal 
cells, the vaginal epithelium could return to a state more akin to the early-menopausal cellular state 
and a physiological vaginal discharge might occur.

Serious adverse events 
Thirty-nine (2.3%) patients in the DBPC group experienced a serious adverse event compared to 17 
(1.8%) in the placebo group, representing an exposure corrected rate of 57 SAEs/1000 women years 
exposure on Ospemifene and 62.3 SAEs/1000 women years exposure on placebo. 
In  response  to  D120  LoQ,  the  Applicant  provided  a  list  and  description  of  SAEs  that  occurred  with 
Ospemifene  60  mg  during  the  DBPC  clinical  programme:  in  total,  with  Ospemifene  60  mg,  32 
subjects (2.6%) experienced 41 SAEs of them 7 were considered by the sponsor as drug related. In 
the  placebo  group,  17  subjects  (1.8%)  experienced  33  SAEs,  from  which  1  was  considered  drug 
related. 
The  AEs  in  the  Ospemifene  group  were  CVA,  endometrial  hyperplasia,  ovarian  cyst,  DVT  (two 
subjects), global amnesia and nausea. The incidences of CVA, DVT and endometrial hyperplasia were 
not higher than the expected background incidence. A registration file was, however, considered too 
limited  to  reliably  estimate  the  incidence  of  these  rare  events.  As  an  increased  risk  of 
thromboembolic events is a class effect of SERMs, a potential increased risk cannot be excluded. The 
risk of VTE and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer is separately discussed below in AEs of interest. 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during the drug development program for Ospemifene. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Two of the Major Objections raised during the course of this procedure regarded clinical concerns on 
endometrial  safety  and  possility  of  increased  risk  of  VTE  events  –  these  will  be  addressed  in  the 
present section. Both concerns were addressed specifically by the Applicant and the overall answers 
were considered adequate by CHMP. 
Endometrial thickness 
Subjects  that  had  uterine  or  vaginal  prolapse  (Grade  2  or  higher)  or  had  clinically  significant 
abnormal gynaecological findings - other than VVA - were excluded. In addition, patients with uterine 
bleeding  of  unknown  origin,  uterine  polyps  were  also  excluded  due  to  the  weak  oestrogen 
agonist/antagonist effect of Ospemifene on the endometrium. Patients with symptomatic and/or large 
uterine fibroids (estimated size >3 cm) were likewise excluded. 
Uterine safety was monitored by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) at baseline, during treatment and at 
the end of study to evaluate endometrial thickness. In addition, endometrial biopsies at baseline and 
end-of-study  to  evaluate  endometrial  histology  were  carried  out,  as  well  as  during  treatment  as 
needed  for  subjects  with  findings  of  endometrial  thickness  ≥4  mm  or  for  symptoms  of  vaginal 
bleeding. Whenever possible, histopathology of all endometrial polyps was determined per regulatory 
guidelines, and central expert review of polyp histopathology was performed. 
An increase from Baseline to 12 weeks was observed for the mean change in the Ospemifene group 
(0.474±1.4292  mm);  little  change  was  observed  for  the  placebo  group  (0.040±1.1500  mm).  Mean 
changes were similar across all doses of Ospemifene, with the exception of ≤15 mg/day, in which no 
mean change from baseline was observed (0.000±0.6281 mm). At 6 months, the mean change from 
baseline in the Ospemifene group was 0.568±1.6434 mm; little change was observed for the placebo 
group  (0.045±1.2625  mm)  for  this  interval.  Mean  changes  were  similar  in  the  Ospemifene  60 
mg/day  group  (0.561±1.6092  mm)  and  the  Ospemifene  30  mg/day  group  (0.620±1.9000  mm).  At 
12  months,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  Ospemifene  group  was  0.800±1.6893  mm;  little

change was observed in the placebo group (0.069±1.2290 mm) for this interval. Mean changes were 
0.814±1.5405  mm  in  the  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  group  and  0.696±2.5628  mm  in  the  30  mg/day 
group.  Also,  at  last  observation,  incidences  of  subjects  with  endometrial  thickness  ≥5  mm  and  ≥  8 
mm were higher in Ospemifene 60 mg group compared to placebo group.

In addition to endometrial thickness, endometrial histology was evaluated and findings were reported 
at  baseline,  12  weeks,  and  12  months  for  biopsy  findings  and  at  12  months  for  the  incidence  of 
endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. 
At 12 months, 317 biopsies were available for evaluation. There were no occurrences of endometrial 
hyperplasia  or  carcinoma  in  any  subject  who  received  Ospemifene  or  placebo.  One  subject  treated 
with  Ospemifene  60  mg  daily  did  have  an  endometrial  biopsy  result  of  simple  hyperplasia  without 
atypia.  This  result  occurred  approximately  3  months  after  the  subject’s  last  dose  of  study  drug  and 
was recorded as an  SAE of endometrial hyperplasia. This equates to an incidence of 0.32% with an 
upper  bound  for  the  95%  CI  of  1.74%.  In  addition,  two  Ospemifene  60  mg  subjects  had  active 
proliferation at Week 52. 
At  12  months,  in  the  Ospemifene  group,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  endometrial  biopsy  findings 
that were classified as “tissue insufficient for diagnosis” (16.2%) or “atrophic” (76.3%). Additionally, 
classifications  of  “inactive”  occurred  in  3.4%  of  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  and  1.2%  of  placebo 
subjects,  and  classifications  of  “weakly  proliferative”  occurred  in  2.6%  of  Ospemifene-treated 
subjects  and  no  placebo  subjects.  There  was  one  subject  with  a  diagnosis  of  “active  proliferative” 
(0.3%)  and  one  subject  with  a  diagnosis  of  “proliferative  pattern,  disordered  type”  (0.3%),  both 
treated with Ospemifene 60 mg/day. 
In  conclusion,  the  requirements  for  assessment  of  endometrial  safety  (risk  of  endometrial 
hyperplasia/cancer)  as  laid  down  in  the  guideline  ‘Clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  product  for 
hormone  replacement  therapy  of  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  in  postmenopausal  women 
(EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1)’  have  been  fulfilled  for  Ospemifene.  Only  1  endometrial  biopsy  with 
simple  hyperplasia  without  atypia  (approximately  3  months  after  the  subject’s  last  dose  of  study 
drug) was observed out of 317 biopsies at 12 months on Ospemifene 60 mg. This single case of case 
of hyperplasia without atypia equates to an incidence of 0.3% with an upper 95% confidence limit of 
1.7%,  which  is  statistically  less  than  2%  after  one  year  of  treatment  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1, 
October  2005).  This  showed  that  there  was  no  increase  in  frequency  of  hyperplasia  in  the  clinical 
programme of Ospemifene. No cases of endometrial cancer were observed. Moreover, in contrast to 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 79/116 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
some  other  SERMs,  no  cystic  changes  in  the  endometrium  were  reported  in  the  Ospemifene  clinical 
programme. An increase in endometrial thickness was observed with a mean of 0.81±1.54 mm over 
12 months. This increase is also noted with other SERMS, such as lasofoxifene 0.5 mg, for which the 
mean thickness increased from 0.61 - 1.44 mm (EPAR Fablyn). The data of Ospemifene did not signal 
a  concern  that  the  use  of  Ospemifene  may  adversely  affect  endometrial  safety.  However,  it  will  be 
important to follow endometrial safety issues in the proposed PASS-study (Annex II condition). 
Vaginal bleeding and spotting 
A total of 22 subjects with an intact uterus in the double-blind, Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled studies 
experienced  a  vaginal  bleeding  and  spotting-related  TEAE:  17  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  (1.5%) 
and  five  placebo  subjects  (0.9%).  The  information  was  collected  by  direct  questioning  either  by 
telephone or during the clinical visit. This approach is considered the most conservative way to collect 
incidence  of  an  adverse  event.  All  episodes  of  bleeding  resolved  without  further  action  and  without 
sequelae. The incidences in the Ospemifene and placebo groups were low and comparable. 
In the phase 2/3 trials, 9 women without a uterus reported vaginal bleeding. In none of the cases a 
potential  cause  of  the  bleeding  was  reported,  except  for  one  woman  who  had  a  gynaecological 
examination on the previous day, which may have caused bleeding. Some of these women had also 
reported  bleeding  in  relation  with  coitus.  The  data  did  not  suggest  that  Ospemifene  use  is  causally 
related to vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women without a uterus. 
Uterine polyps 
Uterine  polyp  related  TEAEs  were  found  in  5/1140  Ospemifene  subjects  (0.4%)  and  1/570  placebo 
subject (0.2%) with an intact uterus. All of these subjects discontinued the study due to the uterine 
polyp  TEAE  per  protocol.  Of  all  findings,  only  one  event  was  felt  to  represent  a  true  polyp  (in  the 
placebo group). 
Breast safety 
Women with a suspicion of malignancy on mammography or a family history of breast cancer of two 
close  relatives  were  excluded  from  clinical  trials.  Mammogram  and  breast  palpation  findings  were 
reported for the DBPC studies in which they were performed.  
There  were  two  cases  of  breast  cancer  reported  in  placebo  subjects  (one  breast  cancer,  one 
carcinoma  in  situ)  in  approximately  300  patient  years  on  placebo.  In  comparison,  there  were  no 
cases  of  breast  cancer  in  the  60  mg/day  Ospemifene  group  with  805  patient  years  of  exposure.  It 
should  be  noted  that  the  duration  of  exposure  to  Ospemifene  in  the  DBPC  phase  2/3  studies  was 
considered too short and the number of treated subjects is too limited with regard to delay of breast 
malignancy  emergence.  Also,  the  limited  safety  information  on  patients  with  a  pre-existing 
malignancy  (due  to  women  with  a  suspicion  of  malignancy  on  mammography  or  a  family  history  of 
breast cancer of two close relativesbeing excluded from the pivotal trials), led to incorporation of the 
following  contra-indication:  “Patients  with  known  or  suspected  breast  cancer  or  undergoing  active 
treatment (including adjuvant therapy) for breast cancer.” 
Vasomotor-related TEAEs 
178  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  (11.2%)  and  43  placebo  subjects  (5.0%)  had  vasomotor-related 
TEAEs  in  the  DBPC  study  population.  The  percentages  of  the  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  with 
vasomotor-related  TEAEs  were  similar  for  the  ≤15  mg/day,  30  mg/day,  and  60  mg/day  groups 
(around  11%)  and  smaller  for  the  90  mg/day  group  (7.5%).  19  Ospemifene  treated  subjects 
discontinued  the  study  due  to  the  vasomotor-related  TEAE  (1.3%),  whereas  three  placebo  subjects 
(0.3%) discontinued the study due to the vasomotor-related TEAE.

In the Ospemifene 60 mg grouping population, hot flushes were the most common reported AE, were 
more severe and more subjects had new experiences of hot flushes compared to the placebo group. 
In  addition,  hot  flushes  were  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  (1%  and 
0.3% of discontinued subjects in Ospemifene 60 mg group and placebo group, respectively). 
The  incidence  of  hyperhydrosis  was  low  and  only  marginally  higher  in  the  Ospemifene  groups 
compared  to  placebo.  No  increase  in  the  incidence  of  hot  flush  or  hyperhydrosis  was  observed  with 
increasing  doses  of  Ospemifene  up  to  60 mg,  neither  for  raw  incidences  nor  after  adjustment  for 
exposure. The 15 mg and 90 mg groups were small and, therefore, considered with caution.

Cervical safety 
Cervical  Pap  smear  was  performed  at  the  screening  visit,  at  week  52  or  if  the  subject  discontinues 
after  the  week  12  visit.  Subjects  with  abnormal  finding  at  screening  were  excluded.  Samples  were 
analysed at a central laboratory and classified according to Bethesda 2001 system for the studies 15-
50310,  15-50310X,  1550718  and  15-50721.  Of  note,  Study  15-50718  and  Study  15-50310X  were 
the only studies that included Pap smear assessments at 12 months. 
DBPC phase 2/3 studies that used Bethesda criteria at 12 months showed that nearly all subjects in 
the Ospemifene group and the placebo group continued to have Pap smear classified as negative for 
intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (96.8% and 95.5%, respectively). Diagnoses of ASC-US occurred 
in  9/401  subjects  (2.2%)  in  the  Ospemifene  group;  none  of  these  subjects  had  a  diagnosis  of 
negative  for  intraepithelial  lesion  or  malignancy  at  baseline.  Diagnoses  of  ASC-US  occurred  in  2/88 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  Additionally,  1/401  subject  (0.2%)  had  a  diagnosis  of  ASC-H  and 
1/401 subject (0.2%) had a diagnosis of LSIL in the Ospemifene group. 
Of note, Ospemifene’s mode of action suggests an estrogen-like effect in the vagina (increasing the 
cellular  maturation  and  mucification  of  vaginal  epithelium).  In  response  to  the  D120  LoQ,  the 
Applicant  reviewed  the  issue  of  a  possible  link  between  oestrogen  exposure  and  development  of 
cervical cancer. The current general opinion is that the occurrence of cervical cancer is closely linked 
to  HPV  infection.  Oestrogens  are  implicated  in  the  progression  to  cervical  cancer  in  infected 
individuals,  but  also  are  suggested to  be protective,  though  evidence  is  certainly  not  that  robust  as 
shown for endometrial and ovarian cancer. However, it was agreed with the Applicant that there was 
no evidence to suggest that oestrogen alone, without the presence of a HPV infection, is a risk factor 
for cervical cancer.

- probably related to study drug. In the opinion of 
the sponsor, while study drug may have 
contributed to the subject’s developing a DVT, 
the relative immobilization from the 8-hour car

played a significant role in the pathogenesis of 
the event.

Placebo 
In  addition  to  AE  observed  in  DBPC  study  results,  two  cardiovascular/cerebrocascular  AEs  were 
reported from 2 subjects from the extension study 15-503 12 (open label uncontrolled study):  
I) One subject from Ospemifene 60 mg group had an acute myocardial infarction. She had a previous 
MI and a significant past history of CVD.  
II)  One  subject from  Ospemifene  60  mg  had  a hemorrhagic stroke/CVA  following  completion  of 12-
week parent study 15-50310  
Of  note,  one  transient  cerebral  ischemic  attack  (TIA)  was  reported  from  subject  in  phase  1  study 
(single dose, 60 mg Ospemifene).  
In the placebo group, only one case of ischemic stroke was reported.  
There were no deaths due to stroke. 
In  addition,  before  randomization,  subjects  in  phase  2/3  clinical  studies  were  screened  for  Factor  V 
Leiden  (FVL)  and  excluded  in  case  of  positive  findings.  In  response  to  the  D120  LoQ,  the  Applicant 
sufficiently  explained  that  based  on  the  estimates  of  the  incidence  of  VTE  (<1/1000  patient  years) 
and  proportion  of  subjects  who  tested  positive  for  FVL  during  screening  for  the  Ospemifene  trials 
(3.2%),  it  is  anticipated  that  despite  the  increased  risk  of  VTE  in  FVL  carriers,  few  or  no  additional 
VTE cases would have been observed if FVL carriers were included in phase 2/3 trials. It is therefore 
not  expected  that  the  currently  provided  risk  estimation  for  VTE  would  have  changed  relevantly  if 
these 128 patients were included in the trials.

Estrogen receptor modulators are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE, see 
table  below),  an  increased  risk  for  Ospemifene  can  therefore  not  be  excluded.  The  possibility  that 
SERMS also increase risk of ATE (including cerebrovascular events) is less clear; up to now no clear 
increased risk is noted for other approved SERMs (raloxifene, bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene). 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
Relative  risk  versus  placebo  in  registration  dossiers  (13,000  –  20,000  patient  years  of 
exposure): 
- Lasofoxifene (Fablyn): 
2.13 (95% CI 1.34, 3.39; p=0.0010) 
- Bazedoxifene (Conbriza): 
1.9 
- Raloxifene (Evista):   
2.13 (95% CI 1.21, 3.75) 
Arterial  thromboembolism 
Relative risk versus placebo in registration dossiers: 
Overall  incidence  of  cerebrovascular  adverse  events  of  myocardial  infarction  did  not  show  a 
statistically significant increased risk. 
Pelvic Organ Prolapse 
In  the  double-blind,  Phase  2/3,  placebo-controlled  studies,  a  total  of  3  subjects  reported  a  pelvic 
organ prolapse-related TEAE: 2 in the 60 mg Ospemifene-group (0.2%) and 1 in the placebo group 
(0.1%). None of the pelvic organ prolapse TEAEs led to discontinuation. 
Mood and depression 
Incidence of mood and depression related AEs was similar between 60 mg Ospemifene treated group 
and  placebo  group.  No  special  safety  concern  regarding  mood  or  depression  was  raised  from  the 
DBPC phase 2/3 studies with Ospemifene.  
Sexual functions 
Sexual  function-related  TEAEs  were  reported  in  0.2%  of  60  mg  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  and 
0.4%  of  placebo  subjects.  Of  the  Ospemifene-treated  subjects,  three subjects  (0.9%)  were  treated 
with 30 mg/day and three subjects (0.2%) were treated with 60 mg/day. One subject in the placebo 
group (0.1%) discontinued the study due to the TEAE (libido decreased). 
Vertebral and other fractures 
In  the  double-blind,  Phase  2/3,  placebo-controlled  studies,  the  percentage  of  subjects  experiencing 
vertebral  or  other  fracture-related  TEAEs  was  similar  between  Ospemifene-treated  and  placebo 
subjects.  32  subjects  reported  a  vertebral-  or  other  fracture-related  TEAE:  18  Ospemifene-treated 
subjects (1.1%) and 14 placebo subjects (1.5%). Of the Ospemifene-treated subjects with vertebral- 
or other fracture-related TEAEs, 2 subjects (0.6%) were treated with 30 mg/day, 15 subjects (1.2%) 
with  60  mg/day,  and  1  subject  (2.5%)  with  90  mg/day.  No  subjects  discontinued  the  study  due  to 
vertebral or other fracture related TEAEs.  
Laboratory findings 
Coagulation parameters: 15-50718 and 15-50310X were the only studies that included assessment of 
coagulation  parameters  at  12  months  in  the  double-blind,  Phase  2/3,  placebo-controlled  study 
grouping.  In  addition,  coagulation  parameter  assessments  were  performed  in  the  Study  15-50312 
(open label) at 12 and 15 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 84/116 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following coagulation parameters were evaluated at Baseline and different time points: Activated 
partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT),  Fibrinogen,  Antithrombin  antigen,  Protein  C  Antigen,  Protein  S 
Antigen (free). Of note, study 15-50718 did not include assessments of protein S Ag (free).  
Pooled  results  from  the  DBPC  phase  2/3  studies  showed,  overall,  in  Ospemifene-treated  subjects 
minor  changes  for  coagulation  parameters  -  and  not  notably  different  from  changes  observed  for 
placebo subjects from Baseline to 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months.  However, the most relevant 
coagulation parameters to assess VTE risk were not studied (i.e activated protein C resistance test, d-
dimer, F&+2, factor VIII). Although the selection of the evaluated coagulation parameters was in line 
with the FDA Guidance for Industry (Guidance for industry: oestrogen and oestrogen/progestin drug 
products 
to 
treat  vasomotor  symptoms  and  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy  symptoms  – 
recommendations for clinical evaluation. January 2003), the CHMP Guideline (clinical investigation of 
steroid  contraceptives  in  women,  EMEA/CPMP/EWP/519/98  Rev  1)  of  July  2005,  recommends  to 
evaluate  additional  biological  variables  possibly  related  to  VTE  risk  and  evaluation  of  these 
parameters was not taken into account in Ospemifene clinical program. 
The  clinical  chemistry  change  tables  and  haematology  change  tables did  not suggest  any  consistent 
or  disturbing  finding  in  any  variable  measured.  However,  none  of  the  haemostatic  variables  are 
validated surrogate endpoint for the clinical endpoint of VTE. 
Lipids:  In  the  DBPC  phase  2/3  studies,  lipid-related TEAEs  were  observed  in  27 Ospemifene-treated 
subjects (1.6%). Among them, 6 (1.7%) received 30 mg Ospemifene and 21 (1.7%) received 60 mg 
Ospemifene. Also, 2 placebo subjects (2.3%) reported lipid-TEAE.  
The most common lipid-related TEAEs in the Ospemifene-treated subjects were hypercholesterolemia 
and  hyperlipidemia.  Two Ospemifene-treated  subjects  (0.1%)  and  one  placebo  subject  (0.1%) 
discontinued due to lipid-related TEAE (hyperlipidemia).  
Table 25: Lipid-related Adverse Events: DBPC phase 2/3 Studies 
Of interest, unlike exogenous estrogen, the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia did not increase but was 
the same or lower in the Ospemifene group compared to the placebo group.  
Also,  in  this  generally  normolipidemic  population,  LDL-cholesterol  decreased  from  baseline  to 
termination in a dose-dependent manner, with the decrease for Ospemifene 60 mg/day at 12 months 
being  -6.96±18.081%,  compared  to  -2.13±18.427%  for  placebo.  At  12  months,  mean  HDL 
cholesterol  increased  by  2.28±14.951%  in  the  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  group  compared  with  -
1.91±12.687% for placebo. At 12 months, the changes from baseline in mean triglyceride levels were 
lower  in  the  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  group  when  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (13.30±36.115% 
and 17.63±37.753%, respectively). 
Study  15-06002  was  a  randomized,  double  blind  placebo  controlled  study  designed  to  compare 
Ospemifene with placebo, with a special consideration of effects on bone, vascular endothelium, lipid

metabolism and endometrium. In this study, lipids (serum Lp(a), triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, 
HDL, HDL2 cholesterol and LDL-BDC), samples were drawn at screening visit, at 12 weeks and at 14-
16  weeks  (for  LDL-BDC  additionally  at  4  weeks).  In  this  study,  Ospemifene  tended  to  decrease  the 
levels  of  total  cholesterol  and  LDL,  and  also  LDL-BDC.  Ospemifene  also  increased  HDL  levels,  but 
HDL2  fraction  did  not  seem  to  contribute  to  this  increase.  After  treatment  period,  total  cholesterol, 
LDL,  LDL-BDC  and  HDL  started  to  return  to  the  pre-treatment  levels,  further  suggesting  that  the 
changes in lipids were caused by the active treatment. Ospemifene had no effect on Lp(a) levels and 
a clinically insignificant increase in triglyceride levels was observed with the highest 90 mg dose level. 
Overall,  from  the  DBPC  phase  2/3  studies,  incidence  of  lipid-related  TEAE  was  comparable  between 
Ospemifene 60 mg group and placebo group; at 12 months, changes from baseline showed a trend to 
a  decrease  in  LDL-  cholesterol  in  subjects  receiving  Ospemifene  60  mg,  and  changes  in  TG  levels 
were  comparable  to  those  in  placebo  group.  Results  from  the  study  15-06002  were  consistent  with 
these findings. Altogether, the data suggest that Ospemifene has estrogen-like effect on lipid profile. 
Blood chemistry parameters: 
In studies 15-50310 and 15-50821 chemistry parameters were evaluated at Screening and at the end 
of  the  12-week  treatment  period/discontinuation.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in 
mean chemistry values between Baseline and 12 weeks in any treatment group in studies 15-50310 
(table 26) and 15-50821 (table 27).

Hematology: The mean values at termination for each hematology parameter were within the normal 
range  for  the  Ospemifene  and  placebo  groups.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  from 
baseline to termination in the mean value of any of  the hematology parameters for the Ospemifene 
and placebo groups. 
Urinalysis: There were no trends or clinically meaningful differences among treatment groups for any 
urinalysis  parameters.  Although  slight  changes  were  observed  from  Baseline  to  termination  for 
specific gravity and pH, they were minor. Mean values at termination were within normal ranges and 
not clinically significant. 
Glucose  metabolism:  In  the  double-blind,  Phase  2/3,  placebo-controlled  studies,  minor  changes  in 
fasting glucose were observed for the Ospemifene group from baseline to all post-baseline time points 
(mean change from baseline to 12 weeks was 0.02±1.074 mmol/L, mean change from baseline to 6 
months  was  -0.01±0.670  mmol/L,  and  mean  change  from  baseline  to  12  months  was  0.05±0.590 
mmol/L). There were no notable trends across the different doses of Ospemifene.  
Vital Signs 
Blood  pressure  and  pulse:  From  DBPC  phase  2/3  studies,  no  notable  changes  from  baseline  to 
termination  were  observed  for  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  in  subjects  treated  with 
Ospemifene  and  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (minor  mean  decrease  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood 
pressure in both Ospemifene and placebo groups). 
There  was  no  consistent  trend  for  change  in  mean  pulse  rate  across  all  doses  of  Ospemifene  in  the 
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 studies. 
Weight: There was a minor increase in weight in both the Ospemifene and placebo groups, with the 
increase  in  the  placebo  group  being  higher  than  that  in  the  Ospemifene  group.  The  percentage  of 
subjects  experiencing  weight-related  changes  reported  as  TEAEs  was  similar  between  Ospemifene-
treated and placebo subjects.

Safety in special populations 
Age:  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  64.0%  in  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  <65  years  and  73.2%  in 
Ospemifene-treated subjects ≥65 years; 55.0% in placebo subjects <65 years and 50.0% in placebo 
subjects  ≥65  years.  In  response  to  the  D120  LoQ,  the  Applicant  provided  a  summary  of  ADRs 
observed in subjects < 65 years, from 65 – 74 years, from 74 to 85 years and over 85 years, and for 
each  of  the  mentioned  age  sub-groups  a  summary  of  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  and  SAEs 
observed. Although the proportion of elderly subjects may be regarded as relatively small, the data 
did not show any special safety concerns with Ospemifene treatment for VVA in women over the age 
of 65 years. 
Race:  The  incidence  of  any  TEAE  in  the  all  Ospemifene  group  was  similar  across  the  three  racial 
groups, with a slightly higher incidence in Black Ospemifene-treated subjects (66.0% White subjects, 
69.2%  Black  subjects,  and  57.4%  other  subjects).  Hot  flush  was  a  TEAE  reported  in  higher 
percentage  of  white  Ospemifene  treated  subjects  (9%)  compared  to  black  Ospemifene  treated 
subjects  (3.1%)  and  other  subjects  (2.1%).  However,  limited  safety  data  is available  from  subjects 
other than white.  
Uterine status: included as a subgroup because it would potentially be possible to assess for uterine 
prolapse,  which  has  been  observed  with  other  SERMs.  Also,  depending  on  the  source  of  increased 
lubrication, complaints of vaginal discharge could have differed in subjects with and without a uterus. 
Results  showed  that  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  was  similar  in  Ospemifene-treated 
subjects  with  and  without  an  intact  uterus  (66.8%  and  64.2%).  Also,  there  were  no  notable 
differences between subjects with and without an intact uterus for the incidence of SAEs.  
Prior  vaginal  birth:  included  as  a  subgroup  because  subjects  with  a  prior  vaginal  birth  could 
potentially have been more prone to pelvic organ prolapse issues. Results showed that percentage of 
subjects  with  TEAEs  was  similar  in  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  with  and  without  a  prior  vaginal 
birth. Also, the incidence of vaginal discharge in subjects with and without a prior vaginal birth was 
higher in Ospemifene (4.5% and 4.9%, respectively) than in placebo (0.3% and 0.8%, respectively). 
Previous  HRT:  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  was  similar  in  Ospemifene-treated 
subjects with and without previous HRT use; the incidence of TEAEs was also similar in Ospemifene 
compared with placebo for subjects with and without previous HRT use. Higher incidence of hot flush 
was  observed  for  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  with  previous  HRT  use  (12.3%)  compared  to  those 
without  previous  HRT  use  (7.6%).  In  subjects  with  and  without  previous  HRT  use,  the  incidence  of 
hot  flush  was  higher  in  Ospemifene  (12.3%  and  7.6%,  respectively)  than  in  placebo  (3.8%  and 
3.2%, respectively). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
From the clinical program phase 2/3, AEs related to drug-drug interactions had not been mentioned. 
The  Applicant  was  therefore  requested  to  clarify  whether  such  AEs  occurred  or  not  in  Ospemifene 
clinical studies.  
- The CYP3A/CYP2C9/CYP2C19 inhibitor fluconazole increased the AUC of Ospemifene by 174% (90% 
CI 147% to 203%). 
-  The  CYP3A/CYP2C9  inducer  rifampicin  decreased  the  AUC  of  Ospemifene  by  58%  (90%CI  53%  to 
63%: Study 15-50716). 
- The CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole increased the AUC of Ospemifene by 17%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 88/116 
 
  
  
- Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased AUC0-inf of Ospemifene by 
42% (90%CI 27% to 60%). 
-  Ospemifene  did  not  affect  the  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and  CYP2B6  activity  when  evaluated  using  S-
warfarin as a  CYP2C9 probe substrate, omeprazole as a sensitive CYP2C19 substrate and bupropion 
as sensitive CYP2B6 substrate. 
The  interactions  with  rifampicin,  omeprazole  and  ketoconazole  were  not  expected  to  be  of  clinical 
relevance when taking into account that no meaningful associations between drug exposures (AUCss 
or  Cmax,ss)  of  Ospemifene  and  the  efficacy  PD  parameters  were  detected  in  the  population  PK/PD 
study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase  2/3,  placebo-controlled  studies:  119/1696  subjects  (7.0%)  in  the  all  Ospemifene  group  and 
36/958  subjects  (3.8%)  of  the  placebo  group;  the  percentage  of  subjects  that  discontinued  due  to 
TEAEs was slightly higher in the all Ospemifene group compared with the placebo group. There was 
no  dose-related  increase  in  TEAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation;  the  incidences  were  6.5%,  5.4%, 
7.6%,  and  2.5%  for  the Ospemifene  ≤15  mg/day,  30  mg/day,  60  mg/day,  and  90  mg/day  groups, 
respectively. 
The  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  all  Ospemifene  group  were  hot  flush 
(16/1696 subjects [0.9%]), headache (10/1696 subjects [0.6%]), nausea (7/1696 subjects [0.4%]), 
muscle spasms (7/1696 subjects [0.4%]), and vaginal discharge (6/1696 subjects [0.4%]). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  patient  exposure  was  considered  adequate.  2471  study  participants  have  received  at  least  one 
dose  of  Ospemifene,  which  fulfils  the  requirement of  at  least  1500  participants  in  the  guideline  ICH 
Topic  E  1  Population  Exposure:  The  Extent  of  Population  Exposure  to  Assess  Clinical  Safety 
(CPMP/ICH/375/95). The median (min, max) duration of exposure to Ospemifene 60 mg was 86 days 
with  a  maximum  duration  in  most  DBPC  studies  of  12 weeks.  191  subjects  received  60  mg 
Ospemifene for more than 52 weeks. Only studies 15-50310X and 15-50718 included subjects for up 
to 52 weeks. According to the guideline CPMP/ICH/375/95 a number of 300-600 participants for long-
term safety is required. However, long-term safety data was limited for an indication for which long-
term treatment may likely be prescribed – therefore, on CHMP’s request, the Applicant has included a 
statement at the beginning of section 4.4 that a yearly appraisal should be conducted of the benefits 
and risks for the individual patient. 
In  the  Clinical  package  submitted  by  the  Applicant,  there  was  no  active-comparator  group 
(alternative VVA treatment group) included in any phase 2/3 studies. In response to the D120 LoQ, 
the  Applicant  provided  an  indirect  comparison  of  Ospemifene  to  local  estrogens,  with  regard  to  the 
benefit-risk ratio. 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  present  in  demographics  between  the  placebo  group  and  the 
Ospemifene groups. In the Ospemifene groups, the percentage of women with an intact uterus  was 
slightly higher compared to the placebo group. This could be explained by the long-term safety study 
50718 in which only women with an intact uterus participated, as the randomization of this study was 
1:6  for  placebo:  Ospemifene,  respectively.  Proportion  of  obese  subject  (BMI≥30  kg/m2)  in  each 
group is unknown.

Dose-response relationship 
No clear dose-response relationship was observed in TEAEs. The 90 mg dose had the lowest reporting 
of TEAEs (37.5%). It should however be noted that the number of subjects treated with 90 mg/day 
was  too  small  to  draw  firm  conclusions.  Between  the  30  and  60  mg  dose/day  no  differences  were 
observed in % of subjects with TEAEs, severity or causality of TEAEs. Similarly, the number of related 
TEAEs was similar for 30 mg/day and 60 mg/day, 31.5% and 30.4%, respectively. 
The number of subjects who discontinued the study due to a TEAE was only slightly higher for the 60 
mg dose compared to the 30 mg dose, 7.6% vs. 5.4%, respectively. 
Serious adverse events 
The exposure corrected rate for serious adverse events was similar for the Ospemifene and placebo 
group,  57  SAEs/1000  women  years  exposure  and  62.3  SAEs/1000  women  years  exposure, 
respectively.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Endometrial safety 
The  requirements  for  endometrial  safety  as  laid  down  in  the  guideline  ‘Clinical  investigation  of 
medicinal  product  for  hormone  replacement  therapy  of  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  in 
postmenopausal  women  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1)’  were  fulfilled.  For  long-term  endometrial 
safety  363  participants  have  been  studied  in  the  indication  VVA,  which  was  considered  acceptable. 
The  submitted  data  of  Ospemifene  did  not  signal  a  concern  that  the  use  of  Ospemifene  may 
adversely affect endometrial safety – however, these concern will be addressed in the proposed PASS 
study (Annex II condition). 
Endometrial thickness 
A  small  mean  increase  was  observed;  0.814  mm  ±1.5405  mm  over  12  months.  However,  this  has 
also been seen with other SERMS, such as lasofoxifene. In comparison, the mean thickness increase 
with  0.5  mg  lasofoxifene  ranged  from  0.61  -  1.44  mm  (EPAR  Fablyn).  Also,  in  contrast  to 
lasofoxifene, Ospemifene does not result in cystic changes. 
There  was  no  difference  in  the  rate  of  vaginal  bleeding  for  Ospemifene  compared  with  placebo. 
Additionally, the bleeding incidence was very low (2.2% for Ospemifene 60 mg vs. 2.6% for placebo). 
Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that  Ospemifene  60  mg  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  unnecessary 
gynaecological procedures resulting from vaginal bleeding or spotting.  
Endometrial histology findings 
-  At  baseline  the  majority  were  as  expected  for  this  population,  i.e.  “atrophic”  and  “insufficient  for 
diagnosis”.  In  the  Ospemifene  group  more  patients  were  seen  with  proliferative  endometrium  at 
Week 12 and 12 months. 
-  One  case  of  simple  hyperplasia  without  atypia  was  observed  after  12  months  of  treatment  in 
Ospemifene 60 mg group that occurred approximately 3 months after the subject’s last dose of study 
drug.  The  EU  criteria  were  met  with  1  case  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  out  of  317  biopsies  at  12 
months  on  60  mg  Ospemifene  with  an  upper  95%  confidence  limit  of  1.7%,  which  should  be 
statistically  less  than  2%  after  one  year  of  treatment  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1,  October  2005), 
showing  that  there  is  no  increase  in  frequency  of  hyperplasia  and  endometrial  cancer  in  the  clinical 
programme  of  Ospemifene.  Although  the  data  provided  did  not  raise  a  concern  that  Ospemifene 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 90/116 
 
  
  
 
adversely  affects  endometrial  safety,  it  is  important  to  follow  endometrial  safety  issues  in  the 
proposed PASS-study.  
Cervical safety 
Nearly  all  subjects  in  the  Ospemifene  group  and  the  placebo  group  continued  to  have  Pap  smear 
classified as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (96.8% and 95.5%, respectively). 
Uterine polyps 
The small number of polyps seen on TVU had a similar frequency between placebo and Ospemifene 
treatment. 
Vaginal discharge 
Vaginal discharge was consistently higher in the Ospemifene group compared to the placebo group: 
3.8%  60  mg  Ospemifene,  3.7%  30  mg  Ospemifene  and  0.3%  placebo.  However,  the  Applicant 
indicated  that  the  recording  of  the  event  did  not  appear  to  differentiate  between  physiological  and 
pathological  discharge  and  that  it  might  physiological  vaginal  discharge  might  be  expected  to  occur 
seeing as Ospemifene increases the number of superficial cells and reduces the number of parabasal 
cells. 
Vaginal bleeding 
For subjects with an intact uterus, the rate of vaginal bleeding per 1000 patient-years is 21.7 (95% 
CI  10.4,  39.9)  for  Ospemifene  60  mg  and  26.3  (95%  CI  8.6,  61.5)  for  placebo.  Outcomes  were  all 
non-malignant  and  included  atrophic,  inactive  or  tissue  insufficient  for  diagnosis  and  one  polyp  and 
fibroidone  case  each.  Additionally,  the  incidence  was  very  low.  Therefore  it  is  not  expected  that 
Ospemifene 60 mg will lead to an increase in unnecessary gynaecological procedures resulting from 
vaginal bleeding or spotting. 
Breast safety 
In  the  Non-Clinical  studies,  an  antagonistic  effect  of  Ospemifene  was  observed  on  breast  tissue. 
Despite  this  antagonistic  effect,  women  with  a  suspicion  of  a  malignancy  on  mammography  or  a 
family history of breast cancer of two close relatives were excluded from the clinical trials. The results 
of  obtained  seemed  to  be  in  support  of  an  anti-oestrogenic  effect  on  breast  tissue:  there  were  two 
cases  of  breast  cancer  reported  in  placebo  subjects  (one  breast  cancer,  one  carcinoma  in  situ)  in 
approximately  300  patient  years  on  placebo,  while  there  were  no  cases  of  breast  cancer  in  the  60 
mg/day Ospemifene group with 805 patient years of exposure. This seemed to suggest that the risk 
of  breast  cancer  in  post-menopausal  women  is  unlikely  to  be  increased  after  limited  exposure 
duration to Ospemifene 60 mg.  
Even though the available safety data did not reveal a special safety concern, a contra-indication was 
incorporated  into  the  SmPC  due  to  the  limited  safety  information  on  patients  with  a  pre-existing 
malignancy:  “Patients  with  known  or  suspected  breast  cancer  or  undergoing  active  treatment 
(including adjuvant therapy) for breast cancer.” 
Vasomotor symptoms 
For Ospemifene the incidence of hot flushes is about 2-fold higher in the Ospemifene group (11.2%) 
compared  to  placebo  (5.0%).  However,  the  discontinuation  due  to  vasomotor-related  AEs  was  low 
(1.3%).  In  comparison,  in  the  Phase  2/3  clinical  programme  for  Lasofoxifene  for  the  treatment  of 
osteoporosis  in  postmenopausal  women,  the  incidence  of  hot  flushes  was  also  2-fold  higher,  i.e. 
14.6% in the 0.5 mg/day Lasofoxifene and 6.4% in the placebo group (EPAR Fablyn).  
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 91/116 
 
  
  
 
 
Cerebrovascular events and Deep Venous Thrombosis 
The data in the registration file of Ospemifene did not show an increased risk of VTE (3.65 per 1000 
patient  years  for  Ospemifene  60  mg  (95%  CI:  0.44-13.19)  vs.  3.66  per  1000  patient  years  for 
placebo (95% CI: 0.09–20.41)) or ATE (1.83 per 1000 patient years for Ospemifene 60 mg (95% CI: 
0.05-10.17) vs. 3.66 per 1000 patient years (95% CI: 0.09-20.41)).  
However,  SERMs  are  known  to  increase  the  risk  of  VTE,  and  due  to  the  limitations  of  a  registration 
dossier,  the  exact  incidence  could  not  be  reliable  estimated,  as  is  shown  by  the  wide  confidence 
limits. Similar uncertainties were present for a possible increased risk of ATE. However, the possibility 
that  SERMS  also  increase  risk  of  ATE  (including  cerebrovascular  events)  is  less  clear;  up  to  now  no 
clear increased risk is noted for other approved SERMs (Raloxifene, Bazedoxifene, Lasofoxifene). 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  was  slightly  higher  for  the  Ospemifene  group.  The  reason  for 
continuation varied with the most frequent hot flush (0.9%), nausea (0.4%), muscle spasms (0.4%) 
and  vaginal  discharge  (0.4%).  However,  the  frequency  of  these  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  is 
considered low. 
Women over 65 years 
A higher incidence of AE (not specifically the drug-related) was observed in women over 65 years 
compared to women below 65 years.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Ospemifene was considered acceptable. No increase in risk was observed 
in breast cancer. The data on VTE and cerebrovascular events provided from the clinical studies did 
not show a statistically significant increase in this risk versus placebo. However due to the limitations 
of a registration dossier, the incidence of such rare events cannot be reliably estimated, as is shown 
by the wide confidence limits. Thus, an uncertainty remains with regard to VTE and possibly ATE risk. 
An  increased  risk  of  VTE  is  a  SERM  class  effect,  although  variable  rates  have  been  reported  for  the 
separate components - Ospemifene may therefore also have an increased risk of VTE. The possibility 
that  SERMS  also  increase  risk  of  ATE  (including  cerebrovascular  events)  is  less  clear;  up  to  now  no 
clear  increased  risk  is  noted  in  the  registration  dossiers  of  approved  SERMs  (Raloxifene, 
Bazedoxifene, Lasofoxifene).  
The  long-term  Ospemifene’s  effect  on  endometrium  is  unknown,  although  the  requirements  as  laid 
down in the guideline ‘Clinical investigation of medicinal product for hormone replacement therapy of 
oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  in  postmenopausal  women  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1)’  were 
fulfilled. The CHMP is of the opinion that the endometrial data obtained do not give rise to a concern 
on endometrial safety. 
Due  to  the  above  uncertainties,  the  CHMP  proposed  to  include  a  statement  at  the  beginning  of 
section 4.4 that Ospemifene treatment should be yearly evaluated. A post-authorisation safety study 
to further investigate VTE, cerebrovascular events, endometrial cancer, increase in uterine diagnostic 
procedures and long-term safety is endorsed by the CHMP (Annex II condition). 
Refer to the section on the Risk Management plan for further details on the measures CHMP 
considered necessary to address issues related to clinical safety.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system. 
Provided  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  System  Master  File  fully  complies  with  the  new  legal 
requirements as set out in the Commission Implementing Regulation, the CHMP considered that the 
Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant was acceptable. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  0.4,  the  PRAC  considers  by 
consensus that the risk management system for ospemifene (Senshio) in the treatment of moderate 
to  severe  symptomatic  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy  (VVA)  in  post-menopausal  women  who  are  not 
candidates  for  local  vaginal  oestrogen  therapy  could  be  acceptable  if  the  applicant  implements  the 
changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.  
The  CHMP  endorsed  this  advice  with  one  change.  This  change  was  the  inclusion  of  ‘off-label  use’  as 
an  important  potential  risk.  The  justification  for  this  change  is  that  the  proposed  indication  for 
prescribing has been changed from a wider, to a more restricted target patient population. However, 
it  may  be  that  prescribing  still  occurs  to  a  wider  patient  population.  This  will  be  monitored  in  the 
imposed PASS. 
The Applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and CHMP.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.0 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Senshio  60  mg  film-coated  tablets  contain  the  active  substance  Ospemifene  (also  known  as  FC-
1271a),  which  is  a  minor metabolite  from  Toremifene.  Ospemifene  is  a  Selective  Estrogen  Receptor 
Modulator  (SERM).  Like  other  SERMs,  Ospemifene  acts  as  an  agonist  or  antagonist  on  the  estrogen 
receptor  in  different  tissues.  The  claimed  revised  indication  is:  “Treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
symptomatic  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy  (VVA)  in  post-menopausal  women  who  are  not  candidates 
for local vaginal oestrogen therapy (see section 5.1).” 
The proposed posology is 60 mg tablet once daily with food. 
Vaginal  low-dose  estrogen  preparations  are  currently  considered  first-line  pharmacologic  treatment 
for  the  treatment  of  VVA  (Royal  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynaecologists  Guideline  Menopause 
and Hormone Replacement). Approved estrogen preparations in Europe are: 
-  Vagifem  10  microgram  (estradiol  tablets  for  vaginal  application)  approved  by  decentralised 
procedure  (UK/H/2176/001)  and  Estring  (estradiol-containing  vaginal  ring)  approved  by  mutual 
recognition procedure; 
- Synapause (estriol ovules/cream for vaginal application) nationally registered. 
In  Europe  no  guidance  document  exists  for  VVA,  though  the  requirements  as  laid  down  in  the  FDA 
guidance for industry ‘Estrogen and Estrogen/Progestin Drug Products to Treat Vasomotor Symptoms 
and  Vulvar  and  Vaginal  Atrophy  Symptoms  –  Recommendations  for  Clinical  Evaluation’  have  been 
previously accepted in the EU during the authorisation of other products for vaginal atrophy, such as 
Vagifem 10 µg. 
Beneficial effects 
In  the  clinical  programme,  statistical  significant  superiority  compared  to  placebo  was  demonstrated 
for change in vaginal pH, percentage of superficial cells and parabasal cells for 60 mg/day in pivotal 
studies 15-50310 and 15-50821. Also for 60 mg/day for the MBS “vaginal pain associated with sexual 
activity” superiority was shown, whereas the 30 mg/day dose did not show a statistically significant 
difference compared to placebo in study 15-50310. Despite the use of non-hormonal lubricant, which 
could be applied by women as needed (making it more difficult to show superiority) in both studies, a 
statistically  significant  difference  versus  placebo  was  shown  for  the  MBS  “vaginal  dryness”  in  study 
15-50310, whereas a trend in favour of 60 mg/day was observed in study 15-50821. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints were used to assess clinical relevance further: 
• 
following criteria were met: 1) Maturation value increased by at least 10 from Baseline; 2) Vaginal pH 
A  clear  difference  was  noted  in  the  responder  rate.  A  subject  was  a  responder  if  all  the 
decreased by at least 0.5 from Baseline; 3) MBS improved by at least 1 point from Baseline. In study 
15-50310  the  responder  rate  was  3.4%  for  placebo,  20.6%  for  30  mg/day  Ospemifene  and  33.7% 
for  60  mg/day  Ospemifene,  and  in  study  15-50821  5.5%  for  placebo  and  39.7%  for  60  mg/day 
Ospemifene.

In  the  validated  Female  Sexual  Function  Index  questionnaire,  a  difference  was  seen  in  pain 
primary endpoint MBS vaginal pain associated with sexual activity at Week 12. 
Long-term effect 
Also  after  52  weeks  in  the  double-blind  study  15-50718  a  statistically  significant  effect  was 
maintained in vaginal pH, percentage of parabasal cells and percentage of superficial cells. The most 
bothersome symptom (MBS) was not included as endpoint.  
Extrapolation of data 
It  would  have  been  preferred  to  include  MBS  also  in  the  dose-finding  study  15-50717  and  in  the 
European  study  15-50718,  as  there  are  currently  no  data  on  the  change  in  MBS  in  the  European 
population. However, a recent international survey (Nappi and Kokot-Kierepa 2010) has shown that 
subjects  from  various  European  countries  are  not  essentially  different  from  those  in  the  USA  or 
Canada  with  regard  to  issues  related  to  vaginal  atrophy.  Indeed,  the  effects  of  treatment  for  VVA 
indicated  no  clear  regional  geographic  differences  in  the  way  women  in  North  America  and  Europe 
experience  the  effects  of  VVA  therapy.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  Ospemifene  on  MBS  in  European 
patients is very likely to be comparable to that seen in subjects of the studies performed in the USA. 
Clinical relevance of observed treatment effect 
An  additional  descriptive  analysis  was  performed  on  the  primary  endpoint  outcome  based  on  the 
medical literature (Ettinger et al, 2008) and discussions with leading European clinicians. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  clinically  relevant  MBS  outcomes  (vaginal dryness  and  dyspareunia) 
at  Week  12  supported  that  the  difference  between  Ospemifene  and  placebo  is  more  pronounced  in 
the  “substantial  improvement”  and  “relief”  categories,  therefore  suggesting  that  not  only  more 
patients report benefit with Ospemifene compared to placebo, but also the magnitude of the benefit 
was greater for Ospemifene than with placebo. 
Further,  in  trial  15-50821 both in  the  vaginal  dryness  stratum  (33.8%  for Ospemifene  vs.  7.1%  for 
placebo)  as  in  the  vaginal  pain  stratum  (42.9%  for  Ospemifene  vs.  4.6%  for  placebo)  a  significant 
higher proportion of responders was identified in the Ospemifene group versus placebo. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Comparison to local vaginally applied therapy 
No  active-comparator  group  (alternative  VVA-  treatment  group)  was  included  in  any  phase  2/3 
studies.  In  the  FDA  guidance  document  no  active  control  is  required.  Similarly,  placebo-controlled 
studies were conducted for Vagifem 10 µg (Simon et al 2008, Bachmann et al 2008) and oestriol gel 
(Cano et al., 2012), and no active control was requested. In response to the D120 LoQ, the Applicant 
provided  indirect  comparison  of  Ospemifene  and  local  estrogens.  In  the  literature  search  all 
publications  on  local  estrogens  were  included.  Two  relevant  publications  for  efficacy  were  identified 
on Vagifem 10 µg (Simon et al 2008 and Bachmann et al 2008). Based on the Applicant’s analysis, 
the  degree of  improvement  in  women  with  moderate  to  severe  symptoms  of  VVA  over  placebo  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015 
Page 105/116 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
comparable  with  that  noted  in  public  literature  for  Vagifem  10  µg.  In  addition,  in  response  to  the 
D180  LoOI,  the  Applicant  adequately  discussed  the  data  on  vaginally  applied  oestriol  (0.005% 
oestriol  gel,  0.03  mg  oestriol,  0.2  mg  oestriol  tablets)  and  promestriene  (10  mg  vaginal  capsule 
administered daily) in comparison to Ospemifene. The degree of improvement of Ospemifene versus 
placebo  was  also  comparable  to  the  degree  of  improvement  versus  placebo  observed  for  vaginally 
applied promestriene and oestriol.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
2471  study  participants  have  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Ospemifene.  For  long-term  safety  353 
subjects  had  ≥48  weeks  of  exposure  and  191  subjects  had  ≥52  weeks  of  exposure,  which  is 
acceptable  according  to  the  guideline  CPMP/ICH/375/95.  No  clear  dose-response  relationship  was 
observed, as between the 30 and 60 mg/day doses no differences were observed in % subjects with 
drug-related  TEAEs,  and  severity  or  causality  of  TEAEs.  However,  due  to  known  side  effects  of 
approved  SERMs  for  other  indications,  special  focus  is  given  to  possible  adverse  effects  on  the 
endometrium, thromboembolism, vaginal bleeding, breast safety and vasomotor symptoms. 
Endometrial thickness 
An  increase  in  endometrial  thickness  was  observed  with  Ospemifene;  0.81±1.54  mm  over  12 
months. This has also been seen with other SERMS, such as Lasofoxifene. In comparison, the mean 
thickness increase with 0.5 mg Lasofoxifene ranged from 0.61 - 1.44 mm (EPAR Fablyn). However, in 
contrast to Lasofoxifene, no cystic changes of the endometrium were observed. 
Endometrial histology 
The  EU  criteria  laid  down  in  the  CHMP  NfG  on  hormonal  replacement  therapy  regarding  the 
investigation  of  endometrial  safety  were  met:  only  1  endometrial  biopsy  with  simple  hyperplasia 
without  atypia  (approximately  3  months  after  the  subject’s  last  dose  of  study  drug)  out  of  317 
biopsies  was  observed  at  12  months  on  60  mg  Ospemifene.  This  equates  to  an  incidence  of  0.3% 
with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.7%, which should be statistically less than 2% after one year 
of  treatment  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1,  October  2005).  No  cases  of  endometrial  cancer  were 
observed.  
Cerebrovascular events and Venous Thromboembolism 
SERMs  are  known  to  increase  the  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE).  No  increased  risk  was 
observed for VTE in the clinical programme: 3.65 per 1000 patient years for Ospemifene 60 mg (95% 
CI:  0.44-13.19)  vs.  3.66  per  1000  patient  years  for  placebo  (95%  CI:  0.09–20.41).  Similarly,  no 
increased risk was observed for cerebrovascular events: 1.83 per 1000 patient years for Ospemifene 
60 mg (95% CI: 0.05-10.17) vs. 3.66 per 1000 patient years (95% CI: 0.09-20.41). These data do 
not indicate a specific concern, but the confidence limits are wide, as a registration file is too limited 
to  reliably  estimate  the  incidence  of  these  rare  events.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  indicated  a 
commitment  to  study  VTE  and  cerebrovascular  events  in  a  post-authorisation  safety  study,  as 
proposed in the RMP (Annex II condition). 
Vaginal bleeding 
Vaginal  bleeding  incidence  was  comparable  versus  placebo:  Ospemifene  group  (1.5%)  vs.  placebo 
(0.9%). Outcomes of subsequent endometrial biopsies (required per protocol in case of bleeding and 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015

also  recommended  in  clinical  practice,  see  SmPC  recommendations)  were  all  non-malignant  and 
included atrophic, inactive or tissue insufficient for diagnosis and one polyp and fibroidone case each. 
Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that  Ospemifene  60  mg  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  unnecessary 
gynaecological procedures resulting from vaginal bleeding or spotting. 
Breast safety 
The  results  of  the  clinical  trial  seem  to  be  in  support  of  an  anti-oestrogenic  effect  on  breast  tissue. 
There were two cases of breast cancer reported in placebo subjects (based on an exposure of about 
300 patient years), whereas no cases of breast cancer were observed in the 60 mg/day group (based 
on  exposure  of  805  patient  years).  However,  patients  with  a  suspicion  of  a  malignancy  on 
mammography or a family history of breast cancer were excluded from the clinical trials, so data in 
patients with a prior history of breast cancer are therefore still limited. 
Vasomotor symptoms 
In  total  178  Ospemifene-treated  subjects  (11.2%)  and  43  placebo  subjects  (5.0%)  reported  hot 
flushes,  indicating  that  in  Ospemifene-treated  women  the  incidence  of  hot  flushes  is  about  2-fold 
higher  in  the  Ospemifene  group  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  discontinuation  due  to 
vasomotor-related  AEs  was  low,  1.3%  (19  Ospemifene-treated  women)  versus  0.3%  (3  placebo-
treated women). 
Vulvovaginal symptoms 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  vulvovaginal  adverse  events  was  higher  in  Ospemifene 
60 mg compared to placebo, 5.4% vs. 2.6%, respectively.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
VTE and ATE (CVA) risk 
SERMs  are  known  to  increase  the  risk  of  VTE,  up  to  doubling  the  rate.  Due  to  the  limitations  of  a 
registration dossier, the exact incidence of this event could not be reliably estimated, as was shown 
by  the  wide  confidence  limits.  Similar  uncertainties  are  present  for  a  possible  increased  risk  of 
cerebrovascular  events.  However,  the  possibility  that  SERMS  also  increase  risk  of  cerebrovascular 
events  is  less  clear;  up  to  the  time  of  this  report,  no  clear  increased  risk  was  noted  with  approved 
SERMs  (Raloxifene,  Bazedoxifene,  Lasofoxifene).  The  uncertainty  with  regard  to  the  possibility  of 
increased VTE risk is of concern – therefore, this will be further investigated in a PASS study (Annex 
II condition). 
Long term safety data 
Long-term  safety  data  was  limited  to  15  months  of  treatment.  Due  to  the  limitation  in  long-term 
safety  data,  and  since  VVA  is  more  or  less  considered  a  chronic  indication,  CHMP  decided  that  a 
yearly  individual  re-evaludation  of  the  need  for  and  risk  of  continuing  therapy  is  performed.This 
recommendation has therefore been reflected in the SmPC. 
Endometrial safety 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  endometrial  safety  evaluations  (endometrial  thickness  increase, 
endometrial histology and uterine polyps) did not raise a major concern. However, long-term safety 
data  after  12  months  is  limited.  To  address  this  uncertainty  on  endometrial  safety,  the  Applicant 
proposes to also follow endometrial safety issues in the proposed PASS-study (Annex II condition).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
For the indication of ‘vulvar and vaginal atrophy’ several estrogen-containing products are registered 
in  Europe.  All  these  products  are  indicated  for  local  vaginal  application:  Vagifem  10  microgram, 
Synapause  (estriol  ovules)  and  Estring  (estradiol  in  vaginal  ring).  Both  estradiol  (oral,  patch)  and 
oestriol  (oral)  are  also  approved  for  systemic  treatment  of  hormone  suppletion  therapy,  but  these 
products  are  not  first  line  in  the  indication  of  VVA  as  these  should  always  be  combined  with  a 
progestagen to protect the endometrium. 
Ospemifene can be taken orally, which can be considered an advantage, as it would be the first oral 
product for VVA and might increase the medication choice for women in the indication of ‘vulvar and 
vaginal atrophy’. 
Superiority versus placebo has been shown for objective endpoints including vaginal pH, percentage 
of  superficial  cells  and  parabasal  cells  when  compared  to  placebo.  Also  for  the  most  bothersome 
symptom  (MBS)  “vaginal  pain  associated  with  sexual  activity”  superiority  has  been  shown.  For  MBS 
“vaginal  dryness”  superiority  was  shown  in  one  pivotal  trial,  whereas  in  the  other  trial  statistical 
significance was not reached. 
These  results  on  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  are  further  supported  by  a  significant  larger 
proportion  of  responders  in  the  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  group  versus  placebo:  in  study  15-50310 
33.7%  for  Ospemifene  vs.  3.4%  for  placebo  and  in  study  15-50821  in  the  “vaginal  pain  associated 
with sexual activity stratum” 42.9% for Ospemifene vs. 4.6% for placebo.  
The  criteria  applied  in  the  responder  definition  (1.Maturation  Value  increased  by  at  least  10  from 
Baseline; 2.Vaginal pH decreased by at least 0.5 from baseline; 3.MBS improved by at least 1 point 
from  baseline),  were  considered  adequately  justified  in  terms  of  clinical  relevance.  Although  the  30 
mg/day dose showed superiority compared to placebo in the co-primary endpoints (except for the co-
primary endpoint MBS), the effect was more pronounced in the 60 mg/day dose. When looking at the 
responder  rate,  the  difference  became  more  apparent  with  20.6%  responders  for  30  mg/day 
Ospemifene  and  33.7%  for  60  mg/day  Ospemifene.  The  60  mg/day  dose  could  therefore  be 
supported.  Moreover,  indirect  comparison  showed  that  the  degree  of  improvement  observed  with 
Ospemifene  versus  placebo  was  comparable  to  that  observed  with  Vagifem  10  µg,  vaginally  applied 
oestriol and promestriene versus placebo. 
In  addition,  the  safety  profile  for  the  30  mg/day  and  60  mg/day  dose  appeared  to  be  comparable, 
and no clear dose-response relationship in ADR incidence was observed for these two doses, which is 
also in support of the acceptance of the 60 mg/day dose. 
The  safety  profile  was  in  line  with  what  can  be  expected  for  a  SERM.  As  to  effects  on  the 
endometrium,  a  slight  increase  in  endometrium  thickness  was  noted,  which  is  not  a  reason  for 
concern. However, endometrial safety will be followed up in the proposed PASS study. No indication 
of  an  increased  risk  in  endometrium  hyperplasia  and  cancer  was  noted.  Furthermore,  in  contrast  to 
Lasofoxifene,  no  cystic  changes  are  observed  in  the  endometrium,  and  no  additional  educational 
efforts are needed to inform pathologists on the endometrial pattern in users of this product. 
The  incidence  of  vaginal  bleeding  was  comparable  to  placebo,  and  treatment  with  Ospemifene  is 
therefore unlikely to result in an increase in additional gynaecological procedures.

In the clinical programme no increased risk was observed for VTE and cerebrovascular events (CVA) 
compared to placebo. However, a registration file is too limited to reliably estimate the VTE and CVA 
risk.  Therefore  the  risk  of  VTE  and  CVA  for  Ospemifene  could  not  be  reliably  estimated.  For  other 
SERMs  up  to  now  no  clear  increased  risk  has  been  noted  for  CVA  (Raloxifene,  Bazedoxifene, 
Lasofoxifene).  A  possibly  increased  risk  for  CVA  is  therefore  unlikely.  However,  an  increased  risk  of 
VTE was observed with other SERMs, and therefore considered a class effect, although variable rates 
have  been  reported  for  the  separate  components.  Ospemifene  may  possibly  also  have  an  increased 
risk of VTE. Even though the VTE risk of local estrogens is also unknown, this risk is expected to be 
low due to the low systemic exposure. Taking this into account, the Senshio’s indication was modified 
to  “Treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  symptomatic  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy  (VVA)  in  post-
menopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy (see section 5.1)”. 
SERMs are also known to increase the incidence of hot flushes. This is a disadvantage in comparison 
to  the  local  treatment  of  VVA  with  estrogen  preparations.  During  use  of  Ospemifene,  a  2-fold 
increase in hot flushes was observed compared to placebo. However, the discontinuation rate (1.3% 
versus 0.3% in the placebo groups) due to hot flushes was low, suggesting that this adverse event is 
not of concern. 
The  safety  data  obtained  did  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  of  breast  cancer,  and  non-clinical  data 
suggested predominantly an antagonistic effect on breast tissue. However, patients with a suspicion 
of  a  malignancy  on  mammography  or  a  family  history  of  breast  cancer  were  excluded  from  the 
clinical trials. As data in patients with a prior history or undergoing active treatment of breast cancer 
was therefore limited, CHMP considered these patients should be contra-indicated – this was reflected 
in the SmPC of the product. 
Long-term  safety  data  were  limited  to  15  months  of  treatment.  In  total,  384  subjects  were  given 
Ospemifene 60 mg for more than 6 months and 191 subjects for more than 12 months. There is also 
no  information  on  the  long-term  safety  with  local,  vaginal  treatment  of  VVA,  but  due  to  the  low 
systemic estrogen exposure the long-term safety profile is considered benign. Even so, risks as noted 
with systemic HRT cannot be excluded, and therefore similar warnings on VTE and ATE are included 
in the SmPCs of local estradiol products. 
Due to these limitations on safety data, the Applicant will conduct a post-authorisation safety study 
(Annex II condition) to investigate venous thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular events, increase 
in  uterine  diagnostic  procedures,  endometrial  cancer,  patients  with  pre-existing  gynaecological 
pathology  other  than  signs  of  vaginal  atrophy,  and  patients  with  malignancy  on  mammography  or 
any  other  kind  of  malignancy  within  10  years  (excluding  basal  cell  carcinoma).  This  study  is 
considered mandatory to determine the incidence of these adverse events, as the safety data in the 
registration data was too limited to reliably estimate the risk. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Regarding  the  clinical  efficacy  of  Ospemifene,  the  degree  of  improvement  over  placebo  in  the  co-
primary  endpoints  was  sufficiently  substantiated  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  comparable  with  that 
noted in public literature for Vagifem 10 µg, vaginally applied oestriol and promestriene.  
Endometrium  safety  data,  assessed  according  to  the  recommendations  of  the  NfG  for  hormone 
replacement  therapies  EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1.,  showed  no  increased  incidence  of  endometrial 
hyperplasia/cancer. An increased risk for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer was also not observed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/78875/2015

approved SERMs, except for Tamoxifen, which is actually an anti-estrogen. These data did not signal 
a concern that the use of Ospemifene may adversely affect endometrial safety. 
The  data  in  the  registration  file  of  Ospemifene  did  not  show  an  increased  risk  of  VTE  or  ATE. 
However,  a  registration  file  is  too  small  to  reliably  estimate  the  incidence  of  such  rare  adverse 
events, as is shown by the wide confidence limits. For other SERMs up to now no clear increased risk 
has  been  noted  for  CVA.  A  possibly  increased  risk  for  CVA  is  therefore  unlikely.  However,  an 
increased  risk  of  VTE  is  observed  with  other  SERMs,  and  therefore  considered  a  class  effect  - 
although  variable rates  have  been  reported  for  the separate  components. Ospemifene  may  possibly 
also lead to an increased risk of VTE, similar to systemic HRT with oral oestrogens. Although the VTE 
risk of local estrogens is also unknown, it is expected to be low due to the low systemic exposure.  
Taking this into account the CHMP therefore proposed to use Senshio treatment for women who are 
not candidates for local vaginal estrogen therapy, i.e. a second-line indication. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
With respect to the clinical efficacy: 
•  The  degree  of  improvement  in  women  with  moderate  to  severe  symptoms  of  VVA  over  placebo 
was  sufficiently  substantiated  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  comparable  with  that  noted  in  public 
literature  for  Vagifem  10  mcg  estradiol,  and  vaginally  applied  oestriol  and  promestriene,  though 
the published data of the latter two products was of lower quality.  
•  Sufficient  documentation  was  provided  that  VVA  can  be  a  clinically  important  condition  with 
painful  physical  symptoms  in  some  women  having  a  significant  impact  on  their  lives  and  their 
relationships with their partners. A reduction in QoL is reported, linked both to the direct impact of 
the  symptoms  of  VVA  and  the  associated  loss  of  sexual  function.  For  women  with  moderate  to 
severe symptoms of VVA medical treatment is accepted, in line with the women who participated 
in the pivotal trials for Ospemifene.  
•  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  is  an  oral  product  for  VVA  with  comparable  efficacy  as  vaginally 
administered  estrogens,  which  increases  the  treatment  choices  for  women  in  the  indication  of 
VVA.  When  the  woman  is  dissatisfied  with  vaginal  therapy  due  to  inconvenience,  messiness,  or 
partner exposure, there are currently no alternatives available. 
With respect to clinical safety: 
•  The number of drug-related SAEs in the DBPC trials was 7 for Ospemifene 60 mg/day (N=1242) 
and 1 for placebo (N=958). This is considered low, given the size of the study population. Further, 
the  treatment  exposure  for  the  Ospemifene  60  mg/day  group  was  about  2-fold  higher  with  548 
years for Ospemifene 60 mg/day and 273 years for placebo. The 7 SAEs in the Ospemifene group 
were CVA, endometrial hyperplasia, ovarian cyst, VTE (two subjects), global amnesia and nausea. 
The  incidences  of  CVA,  VTE  and  endometrial  hyperplasia  are  not  higher  than  the  expected 
background incidence. 
•  No  increased  risk  of  venous  and  arterial  thromboembolism  versus  placebo  was  observed  in  the 
clinical  programme.  However,  the  registration  dossier  is  too  limited  to  reliably  estimate  the 
incidence  of  this  rare  adverse  event.  Since  VTE  is  a  class  effect  of  SERMs,  the  risk  cannot  be 
completely excluded for Ospemifene. In comparison, also for Vagifem 10 µg an increased risk for 
VTE cannot be completely excluded. 
•  Endometrium  safety,  assessed  according  to  the  recommendations  of  the  NfG  for  hormone 
replacement therapies EMEA/CHMP/021/97 Rev. 1., showed no increased incidence of endometrial

hyperplasia/cancer.  Only  1  endometrial  biopsy  with  simple  hyperplasia  without  atypia out  of  317 
biopsies  was  observed  at  12  months  on  60  mg  Ospemifene  approximately  3  months  after  the 
subject’s  last  dose  of  study  drug.  This  equates  to  an  incidence  of  0.3%  with  an  upper  95% 
confidence  limit  of  1.7%,  which  should  be  statistically  less  than  2%  after  one  year  of  treatment 
(EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1,  October  2005).  Ospemifene  resulted  in  a  slight  mean  increase  in 
endometrial  thickness  from  2.1  mm  to  2.9  mm,  without  any  cystic  changes.  These  data  did  not 
signal a concern that the use of Ospemifene may adversely affect endometrial safety. 
Taking into account the above considerations, the following proposal was made: 
Ospemifene  60  mg/day  would  be  the  first  oral  product  for  VVA  with  comparable  efficacy  as  shown 
with  vaginal  administration  of  estrogens,  which  could  increase  the  treatment  choices  for  women  in 
the indication of VVA. SERMs are known to increase the risk of VTE, similar to systemic HRT with oral 
oestrogens.  Ospemifene  may  therefore  also  have  an  increased  risk  of  VTE,  although  so  far  this  has 
not been reported. Although the VTE risk of local estrogens is also unknown, and cannot be excluded, 
but this risk is expected to be low due to the low systemic exposure.  
The  CHMP  therefore  proposed  to  use  Senshio  treatment  only  as  2nd  line  treatment  for  women  who 
are  not  candidates  for  local  vaginal  estrogen  therapy.  The  following  change  in  wording  of  the 
indication was proposed: 
“Senshio  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  symptomatic  vulvar  and  vaginal 
atrophy (VVA) in post-menopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal estrogen therapy 
(see section 5.1). 
Since  VVA  is  more  or  less  considered  a  chronic  indication,  CHMP  recommended  that  a  yearly 
individual  re-evaluation  of  the  need  for  and  risk  of continuing  therapy  is  performed.  A  statement  at 
the  beginning  of  section  4.4  of  Senshio  SmPC  reflects  this  recommendation  and  is  in  line  with  the 
SmPCs of the vaginally applied estrogens. 
“For the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, Senshio should only be initiated for symptoms that 
adversely  affect  quality  of  life.  In  all  cases,  a  careful  appraisal  of  the  risks  and  benefits  should  be 
undertaken  at  least  annually  taking  into  consideration  other  menopausal  symptoms,  effects  on 
uterine  and  breast  tissues,  thromboembolic  and  cerebrovascular  risks.  Senshio  should  only  be 
continued as long as the benefit outweighs the risk.”

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Senshio in the “treatment of moderate to severe 
symptomatic vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) in post-menopausal women who are not candidates 
for local vaginal oestrogen therapy (see section 5.1)” 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

cardiac safety) and clinically significant differences (in the cardiac safety). 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Senshio. The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Considering the target population and taking into account all the clinical data, we consider the benefit-
risk  ratio  of  Senshio  in  the  initially  proposed  broad  indication  as  well  as  in  the  revised  second  line 
indication  (treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  symptomatic  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy  (VVA)  in  post-
menopausal  women  who  are  not  candidates  for  local  vaginal  estrogen  therapy)  negative  for  the 
following reasons: 
1  -  The  efficacy  of  ospemifene  is  limited.    Significant  superiority  of  ospemifene  vs.  placebo  was 
demonstrated with respect to objective signs of vulvovaginal atrophy such as vaginal pH or maturation 
of  the  vaginal  epithelium.  However,  the  results  were  less  convincing  with  respect  to  subjective 
symptoms  which  are  the  primary  reason  for  treatment  of  vulvovaginal  atrophy  in  postmenopausal 
women. In addition, it is noted that the frequency of vasomotor symptoms is doubled with ospemifene, 
compared  to  placebo  (ospemifene  11.2%,  placebo  5.0%)  which  is  considered  as  particularly 
unfavourable in the target population of postmenopausal patients. 
2  -  Regarding  the  risks,  there  are  concerns  with  respect  to  VTE  and  stroke.  VTE  is  a  known  adverse 
event of other SERMs such as raloxifene or bazedoxifene. As expected, the currently available data on 
ospemifene in this respect are too sparse so that definite conclusions in this respect are currently not 
possible. Nevertheless, it appears very likely that ospemifene is also associated with an increased risk 
of  VTE  which  can  only  be  detected  post-marketing.  In  addition,  SERMs  are  possibly  also  associated 
with a risk of stroke which might also apply to ospemifene. 
Although  proliferative  effects  on  mammary  gland  tissue  appear  unlikely  according  to  non-clinical 
results,  the  effect  of  ospemifene  on  ovaries  has  not  been  systematically  studied  and  based  on  non-
clinical  data  available,  estrogenic  action  of  ospemifene  towards  the  ovaries  appears  likely.  Since 
estrogens  appear  to  be  associated  with  ovarian  cancer  also  in  humans,  the  relevance  for  humans  of 
these animal findings cannot be disregarded. In addition, an increase in mean endometrial thickeness 
(0.81mm ±1.54) from baseline was observed with Senshio 60 mg tablets and a proliferative effect on 
endometrium  with  Senshio  long-term  treatment  cannot  be  excluded.  Of  note,  the  proposed  Product 
Information does not mention any limited treatment duration.  
Therefore, the concerns with respect to a possibly increased risk of serious adverse reactions such as 
VTE  and  stroke,  the  endometrial  changes  and  the  uncertain  relevance  of  ovary  tumour  findings  in 
animals  as  well  as  the  increase  in  hot  flushes  associated  with  ospemifene  outweigh  the  obviously 
rather  small  benefit  in  the  treatment  of  a  non-serious  condition  such  as  vaginal  pain  for  which 
established  treatment  options  of  topical  estrogens  are  available.  The  restriction  to  patients  “who  are 
not  candidates  for  local  vaginal  estrogen  therapy”,  does  not  change  our  view  as  it  is  considered 
somewhat artificial and off-label use is very likely in a larger population of postmenopausal women 
Overall, for these reasons, we consider that the benefit/risk ratio is negative for Senshio.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Posaconazole is a broad spectrum triazole antifungal indicated in the systemic treatment of pathogenic 
yeasts  and  moulds  and  is  currently  available  as  an  oral  suspension  (Noxafil).  The  oral  suspension  is 
administered  3-4  times  daily  and  must  be  taken  with  food  (preferably  a  high  fat  meal)  to  ensure 
adequate systemic exposure.  
The  applicant  has  sought  to  maximise  systemic  absorption  and  reduce  the  food  effect  by  developing 
an  acid  resistant  tablet  (gastro  resistant  tablet).  The  product  incorporates  a  pH  sensitive  polymer 
(hypromellose  acetate  succinate)  which  limits  dissolution  in  the  stomach,  thereby  maximising 
dissolution and absorption in the small intestine. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product is presented as new gastro resistant tablets containing 100 mg of posaconazole as active 
substance. 
Other ingredients are: hypromellose acetate succinate, cellulose microcrystalline, hyprolose, silica 
dental type, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol, titanium 
dioxide (E171), talc, iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The product is available in a PVC/ polychlorotrifluoroethylene laminate blister with push-through 
aluminium lidding. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used in the proposed gastro resistant tablets, pocasonazole, is the same active 
substance as that approved for the currently authorised oral solution.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the development was to obtain a solid tablet of a size that was easy to swallow and that 
provided sufficient solubility of the active substance in the intestinal environment to enhance 
bioavailability and reduce the food effect and absorption variability observed with the authorised oral 
suspension. 
The new pharmaceutical form is manufactured with the currently approved active substance which is 
also used for the other already authorised oral solution.

All the chosen excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with 
Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  focus  of  the    commercial  formulation  development  was  to  develop  a  formulation  that  met  the 
proposed  Quality  Target  Product  Profile  (QTPP)  exhibited  the  desired  in-vitro,  in-vivo  performance, 
showed  good  stability  and  was  easy  to  process.  Early  formulation  design  focussed  on  the  prior 
knowledge  gained  from  development  of  an  oral  suspension  and  established  that  the  tablet  should 
deliver low solubility in the stomach (low pH) and high solubility in the small intestine (neutral pH). A 
delayed  release  gastro-resistant  film-coated  tablet,  which  comprises  a  solid  dispersion  of  the  active 
substance  in  Hypromellose  Acetate  Succinate  (HPMCAS)  was  developed.     HPMCAS  is  a  pH  sensitive 
polymer  stabiliser excipient which  was  selected  to  form  a  solid  dispersion  using  a  hot  melt extrusion 
(HME)  method.  The  pH  sensitive  solubility  of  the  HPMCAS  limits  posaconazole  release  at  low  pH 
(pH<4).  At  neutral  pH  (pH6.8),  the  high  solubility  of  HPMCAS  allows  posaconazole  to  be  released. 
Three prototype formulations were developed to optimise the excipient quantities and compared to a 
capsule containing only the extrudate (no excipients).  
The applicant has utilised a Quality by Design approach to finished product development, which has 
been generally adequately conducted. Manufacturing process development used Design of 
Experiments to establish Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs) for manufacturing process parameters. 
The development data provided adequately support the proposed reduced in process testing of tablet 
crushing strength and tablet weight during compression (critical step). 
The primary packaging consists in a PVC/Aclar laminate blister with push-through aluminium lidding. 
The finished product manufacturer tests the primary packaging for identification (IR), visual 
examination and overall thickness. Acceptance criteria was presented and considered acceptable. A 
declaration was also provided showing that the materials in the primary packaging are compliant with 
Directive 2002/72/EC and Directive 94/62/EEC. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 6 main steps: premix and blending, hot melt extrusion, milling, 
blending and lubrication, compression and film coating. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
The applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated through development using Quality by design (QbD) 
principles, that the manufacturing process is adequately controlled within the PARs specified. The 
proposed in process controls for tablet crushing strength and tablet weight are therefore considered 
appropriate and are satisfactorily underpinned by risk assessment 
The manufacturing process is generally well described and process validation will be conducted on the 
first three commercial scale batches of the finished product. An acceptable validation protocol has 
been provided.

Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC) 
and uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis results are provided for a seven batches (development and commercial scale) 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three batches of finished product representative for the commercial scale stored 
under long term conditions for 12  months at 25ºC / 60% RH, for up 12 months under intermediate 
conditions at  30oC/75%RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), and dissolution 
(HPLC). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Additional data were also provided for 
moisture content and polymorphic form. 
In addition, photostability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B using one batch and 
data provided. The samples were analysed for description, assay, impurities, moisture content and 
dissolution. No significant changes were observed thus demonstrating the proposed container closure 
system adequately protects the tablets from light. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of this new pharmaceutical form Noxafil 100 
mg gastro-resistant tablets has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried 
out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This application is supported by the non-clinical safety program conducted for the currently marketed 
POS oral suspension. No additional pharmacology or toxicology studies were conducted in support of 
the POS solid oral tablet. A pharmacokinetic (PK) study in non-human primates (NHP) was conducted 
with various oral and intravenous (I.V) formulations and data from this study was used to bridge the 
solid oral tablet formulation to the current marketed oral suspension. The proposed final clinical 
formulation was not used in this NHP study, however pH-sensitive polymer (hypromellose acetate 
succinate, HPMCAS was used in this NHP study. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Not applicable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A pharmacokinetic (PK) study in non-human primates (NHP) was conducted with various oral and 
intravenous (I.V) formulations and data from this study was used to bridge the solid oral tablet 
formulation to the current marketed oral suspension (Tablet A, Tablet B and capsule). The proposed 
final clinical formulation was not used in this NHP study, however pH-sensitive polymer (hypromellose 
acetate succinate, HPMCAS was used in this NHP study. 
Male Cynomolgus monkeys were given single oral (60 mg) or I.V doses of either 0.4 ml/kg (1 mg/kg 
dose) and 2 ml/kg (5 mg/kg dose). Blood samples were taken pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 
24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-dose. The various formulations can be seen in the Table below.

a: Suspension = Marketed product 
b: Capsule (semi-solid) = Blue gelatin capsule (size 0) containing posaconazole plus benzyl alcohol,Cremophor EL, and Pluronic F68. 
c: Capsule (HPMCAS LF) = Blue gelatin capsule (size 0) containing posaconazole and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate 
(HPMCAS) type LF, solid dispersion, spraydried. 
d: Capsule (HPMCAS MF) = Blue gelatin capsule (size 0) containing posaconazole and HPMCAS type MF,solid dispersion, spraydried. 
The over-all conclusion of this study was that following a single 60 mg posaconazole oral 
administration, all three prototype capsule formulations (i.e. those formations that used HPMCAS-MF 
polymer) increased posaconazole exposure when compared to an oral suspension indicating an 
increase in oral bioavailability. The formulation containing the HPMCAS-MF polymer form displayed the 
greatest increase (~7-fold) in exposure. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Not applicable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The recommended dose of the oral suspension formulation is 200 mg (5 ml) four times a day for the 
treatment of refractory invasive fungal infections and 200 mg (5 ml) three times a day for the 
prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections. For the tablet formulation of posaconazole, there is a 
recommended loading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day on the first day, then 300 
mg (three 100 mg tablets) once a day thereafter. An assessment of the risk was performed for the 
oral suspension and no significant risk to the environment related to the use of posaconazole was 
anticipated. 
The Phase I screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) indicates that further 
evaluation of posaconazole is not warranted due to a log Kow < 4.5.  
Based on the outcome of the Phase I environmental assessment, the predicted environmental 
concentration in surface water (PECSURFACEWATER) for the active ingredient, posaconazole was 4 
μg/L, indicating that posaconazole may represent a risk to the environment following its prescribed 
usage in patients. Therefore a Phase II-Tier A environmental effects assessment and concomitant risk 
assessment was required.  
The outcome of the Phase II Tier A Assessment comparing the Predicted No Effect Concentration 
(PNEC) and PEC ratios conclude that posaconazole does not present a risk to surface water, ground 
water, micro-organisms or to sediment-dwelling organisms. Posaconazole will not bioconcentrate and 
is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment due to normal patient use. Thus, no 
Assessment report

further action was necessary in this case and no special precautionary or safety measures need to be 
taken for the storage, labelling, administration, and disposal of posaconazole. 
A risk assessment for sediment dwelling organisms was conducted and calculated to be 0.01. Since 
this value is less than 1, posaconazole was considered unlikely to represent a risk to sediment 
dwelling organisms. 
In response to questions, the applicant provided further information on the environmental risk of the 
proposed product. 
The applicant has conducted a risk assessment for sediment dwelling organisms which includes a 
refinement of the Fpen based on published epidemiological data. A refined Fpen of 0.031% was used. 
This estimate was considered to be the upper limit of the population potentially exposed because it 
assumes all patients with the above-mentioned diseases will take posaconazole. The resulting PECSW 
was 0.12 μg/L. 
A PNEC for sediment (PNECSED) of 0.76 mg/kg 760 (μg/kg) was calculated. The PEC for sediment 
(PECSED) was calculated using the refined Fpen of 0.031%, the highest soil Koc value for 
posaconazole, and a refined PECSW of 0.0011 μg/L, estimated using SimpleTreat 3.1. For this 
assessment, PECSED was conservatively estimated to be 8.06 μg/kg (0.0081 mg/kg). The PEC/PNEC 
for sediment was determined by comparing the PECSED to the PNEC based on the midge test 
(PNECSED). The ratio calculated by the Applicant was: 
760 μg/kg 
8.06 μg/kg = 0.01 
The applicant stated that since this ratio is less than 1, posaconazole was considered unlikely to 
represent a risk to sediment dwelling organisms.  
However, a PEC sediment of 963 µg/kg (dry sediment) by Simple Treat has also been calculated. The 
value is based on a lower vapour pressure (no votalization) for injection applications. Nevertheless, no 
risk for sediment is expected although the risk quotient is slightly above 1 (1.3) because the tested 
concentration in the sediment organism test (76 mg/kg mean measured) was far above the water 
solubility and no effect was observed. 
The half-life of the parent posaconazole in two river sediments was calculated to be 20.4 and 21.1 
days. The half-lives of the two major transformation products in in two river sediments were 
calculated to be 38 and 106.7 (metabolite M2) and 358.1 and 108.1 (M3). The Applicant states that 
the metabolites (M2 and M3) could not be named according to chemical nomenclature as their 
definitive structures are unknown.  
However, different half-lives for the fate of the major transformation products (elucidated structure) of 
posaconazole in water/sediment systems have been calculated. Nevertheless, all three transformation 
products show persistence in sediment with half-lives >120d. Posaconazole is therefore classified as 
being persistent. The identified three transformation products can be included in the summary of the 
main study results with the DT50 values as follows: 
M1 (cannot be named): stable in sediment, persistent 
M2 (cannot be named): 215.9 d (DE recalculated, SFO), persistent 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014

M3 (cannot be named): 358.1 d, persistent 
The Applicant has also provided the bioconcentration test report (Wildlife International, Ltd., 
Posaconazole: A bioconcentration test with the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), Final report, 16-Oct-
2012 which was cited in the environmental risk assessment. The results of the submitted 
bioconcentration test report were considered plausible although the validation criteria for the study 
failed. The test concentrations in the test chambers varied more than ± 20%. The applicant stated 
that the variability in analytical results was due to the initial impacts of aeration of test solutions. 
Aeration during the study was considered necessary to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations to 
keep the large number of fish alive which were required for tissue sampling during the course of the 
test.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Relevant pharmacokinetics data came from the following 5 studies in healthy volunteers and one 
patient study: 
Three  clinical  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  relative  and  absolute 
bioavailability of posaconazole administered as different tablets and dosage forms and/or the effect of 
food on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole. (P04975, P07691, P07783) 
In addition, a food effect study was carried out in the clock stop period with tablet D (study P112). 
Study P04975 
Study P04975 was an open-label, partially randomized, 4-way crossover, 100-mg single-dose, 2-part 
study, in 16 patients designed to characterize posaconazole pharmacokinetics for a new capsule and 2 
new prototypical tablet formulations (tablet A and B) relative to the marketed oral suspension 
(Noxafil) in 16 healthy volunteers under fasting and fed conditions.

Posaconazole PK parameters after single dose administration of different posaconazole 
formulations in fed versus fasted state 
  Exposures  for  the  posaconazole  tablet  (Tablet  A  and  B)  and  capsule  formulations  were  not 
markedly affected by food. (Consistent with historic data, a high-fat meal increased the mean 
peak  and  total  exposures  2.5-  to  3-fold  when  posaconazole  was  administered  as  an  oral 
suspension.)  
  Under both fasted and fed conditions, both posaconazole tablet formulations (tablets A and B) 
and the capsule formulation showed similar peak and total exposures.  
  Under fasted conditions, the tablet formulations (tablets A and B) and capsule formulation had 
less  intersubject  variability  in  peak  and  total  exposures  than  the  posaconazole  oral 
suspension.

This six-sequence, randomized, open label, three-period, single site, single-dose study compared 
three formulations of posaconazole (tablet D, tablet C and oral suspension) in healthy subjects (18 to 
65 years old) male and female subjects with a BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m2.  
The study was designed to assess the relative bioavailability between the posaconazole tablet D with 
posaconazole tablet C (both 100mg, fasted), and posaconazole tablet D fasted with posaconazole oral

  Following a single dose administration of posaconazole 100 mg in the fasted state in healthy 
adults, the AUCs and Cmax of posaconazole tablet D were slightly lower compared to the AUCs 
and Cmax of posaconazole tablet C (10% and 14% lower respectively for AUC and Cmax);  
  The differences in AUC and Cmax between the tablet formulation D and the oral solution are 
not clinically relevant.  
  Following a single dose administration of posaconazole 100 mg in the fasted state for 
posaconazole tablet D and after a high fat meal for posaconazole oral suspension 100mg in 
healthy adults, the AUC and Cmax were considered to be similar between treatments. 
Study P07783 (Part 1) 
This study was an open label, two-part, single and multiple-dose study in healthy volunteer subjects. 
Part 1 of the study was designed to estimate the absolute bioavailability of the FMI 
(posaconazole tablet D yellow) compared to an investigational posaconazole intravenous (IV)

formulations. 
Part 2 of the study was designed to estimate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of posaconazole 
tablet D following 8 days of daily administration of 300 mg and is described later.  
Mean AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ for the posaconazole tablet (tablet D) (22722 and 23647 hr*ng/mL, 
respectively) were approximately 2-fold smaller compared to the posaconazole IV solution (42905 and 
44380 hr*ng/mL, respectively). The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) following the 
posaconazole tablet administration was approximately 7- fold lower than Cmax after posaconazole IV 
solution administration. Cmax was reached at a median of 5 hours for the tablet and at the end of 
infusion (0.5 hours) for the IV solution. The variability in Cmax and AUCs was consistently higher 
following posaconazole tablet administration (CV 38% to 48%, respectively) than following 
posaconazole IV solution administration (CV 19% to 32%, respectively). 
The mean elimination half-life was similar (between 28 and 29 hours) for the two formulations. The 
(apparent) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were both approximately twice as high for 
the posaconazole tablet than for the posaconazole IV solution.

administration, in a cross-over design. The wash-out between successive dose administrations was at 
least one week. A total of 18 healthy male and female adult volunteers between 18 and 65 years 
(inclusive), BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive), were enrolled. Blood samples for PK evaluation 
were collected pre-dose (0 hour) and up to 72 hours post dose on Day 1. 
Results of this study show that when a single dose of 300 mg posaconazole Tablet D is taken with a 
high fat meal, posaconazole exposure in terms of AUC0-last and Cmax increased 51% and 16%, 
respectively. 
Multidose studies with oral formulations 
Study P05637 (tablet C) 
This study was a randomized (3:1), third-party blind, placebo-controlled, single and rising multiple-
dose study, designed to determine the multiple dose (primary objective) and single dose (secondary 
objective) pharmacokinetics of posaconazole for a new solid oral tablet formulation in healthy 
subjects. Tablet C was used in this study.  
This healthy volunteer study (n= 24, from 18- 65 years of age) was performed to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of posaconazole tablets and to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability. In addition, the effect of a twice daily (BID) loading dose and BID 
multiple dosing on the pharmacokinetics and safety was investigated.  
A total of 24 subjects were to be randomized to one of two cohorts of 12 subjects each (9 active and 3 
placebo) to receive single and multiple doses of posaconazole oral tablet.  
For Cohort 1 (n= 12), on Day 1, subjects received a single 200 mg dose of posaconazole or placebo. 
On Day 6, subjects received a 200 mg BID dose of posaconazole or placebo in the morning and

evening. On Days 7 through 14, subjects received a 200 mg once daily (QD) dose of posaconazole or 
placebo. On Days 15 through 22, subjects received 200 mg BID doses of posaconazole or placebo in 
the morning and evening. 
For Cohort 2, on Day 1 subjects received a single 400 mg dose of posaconazole or placebo in the 
morning. On Day 6, subjects received a 400 mg BID dose of posaconazole or placebo in the morning 
and evening. On Days 7 through 14, subjects received a 400 mg QD dose of posaconazole or placebo. 
Cohort 2 did not contain the BID doses on Days 15 through 22 that were administered in Cohort 1. PK 
modelling data suggested that safe exposure limits would be exceeded at 400 mg BID. 
Pharmacokinetic Results (Single Dose) 
Table 3 Mean (%CV) of Posaconazole PK Parameter Following Single Oral Tablet 
Administration of Posaconazole 200 mg or 400 mg 
Following single oral administration of posaconazole tablet, the exposure increased in a dose-related 
manner. Based on log-transformed data, the dose-normalized Cmax and AUC for posaconazole 400 
mg were 83% and 91% of that observed with the 200 mg dose). 
Pharmacokinetic Results (Multiple Doses) 
Following multiple oral administration of posaconazole tablet (200 mg QD, 200 mg BID, and 400 mg 
QD) for 8 days, the exposure among treatment groups increased in a dose-related manner. Based on 
log-transformed data, the dose-normalized Cmax and AUC for posaconazole 400 mg were 76% and 
81% of that observed with the 200 mg dose. The accumulation ratios upon multiple doses were 3.14, 
4.75 and 3.16 for 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD doses, respectively. The variability in 
exposure for 400 mg dose appeared to be relatively higher (CV% of 54% for AUC). The steady state 
appeared to be achieved by Day 13.

Pharmacokinetic interaction study 
Study P07764 
This was a randomized, open-label, single center, five-way crossover, single dose healthy volunteer 
study requested by the FDA to investigate whether differences in absorption of posaconazole tablets 
were observed by increasing gastric pH and by changing the gastric and intestinal motility through 
pharmacological intervention with 4 drugs:  
In this study Tablet D green was used. Twenty-one (21) subjects were enrolled and 20 subjects 
completed the study, with 1 subject withdrawing consent prematurely. 
Antacid: A single 400 mg (100 mg x 4) dose of posaconazole tablets was dosed immediately after 
administration of 20 ml of Mylanta Ultimate Strength liquid under fasted condition. 
Ranitidine: The H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine (Zantac tablets) was dosed at 150 mg BID orally on 
Day 1. A single 400 mg dose of posaconazole tablet was administered one hour after administration of 
the first ranitidine dose under a fasted condition.  
Esomeprazole: The proton-pump inhibitor esomeprazole (Nexium) was dosed as 40 mg once in the 
morning QAM x 5 days (Days -4 to 1). Then on the fifth day (Day 1) esomeprazole was administered 
with a single 400 mg dose of posaconazole tablet under fasted condition.

Metoclopramide: The prokinetic agent metoclopramide (Reglan) was dosed at the highest 
recommended dose, 15 mg orally four times daily, during two days, starting on Day -1. On Day -1, 
metoclopramide doses were to be taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before meals and at 
bedtime. In the morning of Day 1 metoclopramide was to be administered together with a single 400 
mg dose of posaconazole tablet under fasted condition.

In conclusion, there is no clinically meaningful effect of gastric pH or gastric motility on the 
pharmacokinetics of posaconazole after co-administration of posaconazole with each of these drugs 
affecting the gastric pH or gastric motility. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Not applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The aim of the development programme was to produce a formulation that would improve exposure 
and avoid the requirement for multiple dosing taken with a high fat meal, which was recognised to 
pose problems in the target population. The proposed new tablet formulation is designed to inhibit the 
release of the active ingredient until the drug reaches the small intestine, where the entire dose of 
solubilised posaconazole is to be released triggered by the higher pH, aiming to maximize systemic 
absorption. During the development of the acid resistant pH-sensitive tablet formulation of 
posaconazole, several prototype formulations were tested (tablets A, B, C, capsule). The tablet 
formulations differed in their excipients, but the ratio of the solid dispersion composition of HPMCAS 
was held constant in all tablets (and the capsule). Dissolution showed similar release characteristics 
for all tablets with complete dissolution of the posaconazole tablets within 60 minutes, using two- 
stage dissolution with pH change from 2 to 6.8 at 30 minutes, mimicking conditions of use with a 
transit from highly acidic to less acidic environment in the GI tract. Tablet D (yellow) was chosen as 
the FMI. D yellow and D green differ in the colour coating only and can be considered equivalent. 
Study P07691 demonstrated that tablet D, when given fasted, has a similar overall exposure when 
compared with the currently marketed posaconazole oral suspension administered after a high fat

meal, when both are given at a dose of 100mg. It is noteworthy that the approved dose for the oral 
suspension as prophylaxis 200mg, given 3 times daily, while the proposed dose for the tablet 
formulation in this indication is 300mg once daily.  Following the CHMP discussion, a study 
investigating the food effect of tablet D was performed during the clock stop period and demonstrated 
that a food effect is observed with tablet D, but is considerably less than with the oral suspension. 
After a high fat meal, AUC is increased by 50% with the tablet compared to the fasting state. The 
effect on Cmax is small (16% increase).  
A single dose study comparing tablet D to a non- approved intravenous solution (currently under 
evaluation in another line extension procedure) demonstrated an absolute bioavailability of around 
50% in the fasting state. Variability for AUC and Cmax was higher with the tablet formulation, 
indicating that absorption factors contribute to CV%. As expected apparent clearance and Vz were 
twice as high for the tablet. T1/2 was around 28h for both formulations after a single dose. 
Of note, these single-dose studies were performed with a posaconazole dose of 100mg. The dose 
proposed for marketing is 300mg (3 tablets of 100 mg), making this the preferred choice of dose for 
comparative bioavailability studies for a drug with linear PK. 
Multiple dose studies were conducted with tablets C and D. Steady state was reached on Day 6- 8 of 
multiple dosing. There is relevant accumulation with multiple dosing, which is higher than expected, 
with an accumulation ratio of around 3. Half- life after 400mg QD multiple dosing was 26 h, as seen 
after single dose administration. Exposure increased approximately linearly between doses of 100mg 
and 400 mg with tablets D and C.  Dose linearity of doses up to 800mg had previously been 
demonstrated for the oral suspension. Relevant interactions with drugs affecting stomach pH and 
emptying were not observed. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The goal of the development programme was to produce a formulation with a reduced food effect and 
increased absorption.   
With  the  results  of  study  P112,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  food  effect  of  tablet  D  was  relevantly 
reduced  when  compared  to  the  oral  suspension,  but  not  entirely  abolished.  Exposure  increases  by 
about  50%  with  a  high  fat  meal  with the  tablet  compared to 3-  4  fold  with the  oral  suspension.  The 
effect on Cmax is small for the tablet formulation. The effect of lighter meals on AUC is unknown. 
At  a  single  dose  of  100mg,  tablet  D  given  when  fasted  produces  similar  exposures  as  100mg  oral 
suspension when given in the fed state.  
Tablet  D  (fasted)  was  shown  to  have  an  absolute  bioavailability  of  around  50%  compared  to  an 
investigational  intravenous  solution,  which  is  currently  under  regulatory  review  in  a  parallel  line 
extension procedure.  
Inter-study  comparisons  showed  that  after  single  doses  with  the  tablet  formulations,  there  is  an 
approximately linear increase of exposure up to a dose of 400mg.  
The half- life for the 4 tablets A- D was similar, ranging from around 26- 29 hours, resulting from an  
apparent  clearance  of  around  11-  15  L/h  and  a  high  volume  of  distribution.  Exposures  ranged  from 
around 1140- 8400 hr.ng/mL and were lowest for tablet D.  
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 28/75 
 
  
  
There is significant accumulation (accumulation factor around 3) which is greater than expected. This 
may at least in part be due to differences in food intake. Steady state is reached by Day 6-8. Apparent 
clearance  decreases  and  half-life  is  longer  with  multiple  dosing,  and  AUC  and  Cmax  increase.  These 
effects  are  not  fully  explained,  but  posaconazole  may  inhibit  its  own  metabolism,  thereby  reducing 
clearance over time. In addition, changes in food intake over time may increase exposure. This effect 
would be expected to be less pronounced with the tablet formulation and absent with an intravenous 
formulation. 
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  posaconazole  tablets  have  been  sufficiently  characterised,  although 
the reason for the extent of accumulation seen is not fully clarified. 
2.5.  Bridging strategy, pharmacokinetics in target population and clinical 
efficacy 
2.5.1.  Bridging Strategy 
This clinical program for the posaconazole tablet has been designed to demonstrate comparable 
exposure and safety for the posaconazole tablet among the same patient populations for which the 
posaconazole oral suspension has already been approved. The primary intent of the pivotal clinical 
study in patients (P05615) was to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess the safety 
of the posaconazole tablet in neutropenic subjects (AML and MDS) and in subjects who had undergone 
a HSCT and were under treatment for GVHD.  
The MAH states that a clear dose-response relationship has been identified with higher exposures 
associated with a higher likelihood of clinical response. In general, efficacy for prophylaxis appeared to 
be greater in posaconazole-treated subjects than in control subjects when posaconazole exposures 
were in the second or higher quartiles. This effect was seen not only in the pivotal Phase 3 prophylaxis 
studies (P 01899 and C/I98- 316) but also in patients with aspergillosis enrolled in the refractory IFI 
study (P00041)  
Posaconazole Oral Suspension Exposure Response Analysis In Key Clinical Treatment and 
Prophylaxis Trials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 29/75 
 
  
  
The plasma concentrations achieved in the 2 prior prophylaxis trials with posaconazole oral suspension 
at the approved clinical dose have been used by the MAH as a predictor of overall prophylaxis efficacy, 
and  these  2  studies  provide  the  basis  for  the  target  therapeutic  exposure  in  the  bridging  study.  In 
study  P01899,  the  mean  posaconazole  plasma  concentration  following  posaconazole  oral  suspension 
was  583  ng/mL,  with  90%  of  patients  attaining  posaconazole  average  plasma  levels  (Cavg)  greater 
than  or  equal  to  228  ng/mL.  In  study  C/I98-316,  the  mean  posaconazole  plasma  concentration 
following  posaconazole  oral  suspension  was  1130  ng/mL  with  90%  attaining  posaconazole  plasma 
Cavg greater than or equal to 322 ng/mL. 
Furthermore,  a  key  fungal  pathogen  that  is  targeted  with  antifungal  prophylaxis  and  antifungal 
treatment is Aspergillus. Based on in vitro data, the posaconazole minimum inhibitory concentration of 
90%  of  isolates  (MIC90)  for  Aspergillus  species  isolated  from  clinical  infections  is  0.5  ug/mL  (500 
ng/mL). 
Hence, the exposure target for selecting a dose for the posaconazole tablet in the pivotal posaconazole 
tablet patient study (P05615) was a steady -state Cavg range between 500 ng/mL to 2500 ng/mL for 
90%  of  subjects.  This  exposure  range  was  selected  based  upon  the  exposure  response  relationship 
noted with posaconazole oral suspension in the prophylaxis of IFI setting (C/I98 -316 and P01899) as 
well as the studies that were conducted in the refractory IFI setting (P00041). It was expected that a 
greater  proportion  of  subjects  would  attain  Cavg  greater  than  or  equal  to  500  ng/mL  with  the 
posaconazole tablet than with the oral suspension, as issues regarding limited absorption due to poor 
food intake were considered no longer relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 30/75 
 
  
  
 
 
 
With regards to the upper exposure limit, the protocol P05615 specified that the upper limit exposure 
Cavg threshold for posaconazole tablet Phase 1B portion of the study was to be 3750 ng/mL. A similar 
study for the posaconazole IV solution (study P05520) specified an upper limit exposure Cavg 
threshold for the posaconazole IV study to be 3650 ng/mL. The maximum desired exposure target 
was related to safety based upon prior clinical and preclinical events with posaconazole. The 
development program for posaconazole tablet sought to maintain exposures within the upper limit of 
exposures achieved with previous posaconazole formulations. The highest posaconazole steady-state 
exposures in prophylaxis studies were noted in subjects with Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) 
receiving posaconazole prophylaxis (99th percentile of exposure: 3260 ng/mL). Posaconazole 
exposures in healthy volunteers receiving posaconazole oral suspension have been shown to be 2-fold 
to 3-fold higher than those found in patients and include exposures up to approximately 5960 ng/mL. 
Within this range of exposures, no dose-limiting safety events have been identified in either patients 
or healthy volunteers enrolled in posaconazole oral suspension clinical trials. In animals, preclinical 
findings of a possible association of an effect on steroidogenesis with high posaconazole exposure 
have been noted similar to that reported with other azoles. This effect has been observed in animals 
at an AUC of approximately 130,000 hr.ng/mL (Cavg of 5,400 ng/mL) with a no-effect level 
preclinically with AUC <90,000 hr•ng/mL (Cavg 3,750 ng/mL). Exposure was targeted to be within the 
range of posaconazole exposures previously studied and considered to be safe and effective in the 
prophylactic setting. The exposure target is based upon the range of exposures achieved, as well as 
the exposure-response relationship found in earlier controlled studies of posaconazole oral suspension.

• 
The exposure target range for the use of posaconazole tablets in patients in the prophylaxis 
setting was set as below:  
Cavg at steady-state levels ≥500 ng/mL or AUC ≥12,000 hr•ng/mL in at least 90% of subjects 
(per PK evaluable dosing cohort).  
•  Mean Cavg steady-state level ≤2,500 ng/mL or AUC ≤59,000 hr•ng/mL (per serial PK-
evaluable dosing cohort)  
•  No subject with a mean steady-state plasma concentration >3,750 ng/mL or with a steady-
state AUC >90,000 hr•ng/mL (per serial PK-evaluable dosing cohort) 
Cavg was the exposure parameter used in studies with posaconazole oral suspension and therefore 
this was the major bridging PK parameter. In addition to the Cavg as the major bridging parameter, 
the Cmin is taken into account and evaluated against the Cavg requirements. 
PK and exposure in target population: Main study (P05615) 
This  single  pivotal  Phase  1b/3  study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics,  safety,  and 
tolerability  of  multiple  dose  administration  of  posaconazole  tablet  in  patients  receiving  prophylaxis. 
Study  P05615  was  a  single-arm,  open-label,  multicentre,  global  study  of  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
safety of posaconazole tablet used as prophylaxis in 230 adult subjects at high risk for IFIs. 
Further details on the study design are given in section “Clinical efficacy” . 
The primary objective of this study was the characterization the PK profile of posaconazole tablets in a 
representative subject population.  
Treatment administered 
Tablets were taken without regard to food. Planned treatment duration was up to 28 days, minimum 
duration 8 days 
Population and sampling 
Part 1 enrolled neutropenic subjects undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS) with a minimum duration of therapy of 8 days and a maximum 
duration of 28 days. 
Part 1A: 200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg QD thereafter 
Part 1B: 300 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 300 mg QD thereafter 
The dose selection and decision to proceed to Part 2 were based on the posaconazole tablet exposure 
levels achieved and the safety observed among the Part 1 subjects.  
Part 2 enrolled two patient populations. Neutropenic subjects undergoing chemotherapy for AML or 
MDS and subjects who were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
Patients received a dose of 300mg posaconazole per day (after a loading dose of 2x 300mg on day 1). 
Sampling Part 1: 
Assessment report

Page 32/75 
 
  
  
 
 
  Serial PK sampling on Day 1 and Day 8 at pre-dose, approximately 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours 
post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8 in all patients  
 
Trough levels on Day 2, Day 3, Day 8, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28 (or EoT) in all patients 
Sampling Part 2: Sparse PK sampling (trough, Cmin) in all subjects 
  Serial PK sampling on Day 1 and Day 8 in a subset of ca. 30 HSCT patients  
The primary PK parameter of interest was the plasma posaconazole exposures at steady state (Cavg). 
The desired exposure targets at steady state needed to be met in Part 1 to allow for dose selection for 
Part 2.  
A dose was to be selected for Part 2 based on the following criteria in the serial PK-evaluable cohort: 
•  Cavg at steady-state levels ≥500 ng/mL or AUC ≥12,000 hr·ng/mL in at least 90% of subjects 
(per PK evaluable dosing cohort). 
•  Mean Cavg steady-state level ≤2,500 ng/mL or AUC ≤59,000 hr·ng/mL (per serial PK-
evaluable dosing cohort)  
•  No subject with a mean steady-state plasma concentration >3,750 ng/mL or with a steady-
state AUC >90,000 hr·ng/mL (per serial PK-evaluable dosing cohort) 
In addition, Cmin values were to be evaluated similar to the Cavg. 
PK Results 
A total of 230 subjects were treated, 20 subjects treated with posaconazole tablet 200 mg (Part 1A), 
and 210 subjects treated with posaconazole tablet 300 mg (Part 1B, n=34; Part 2, n=176). The study 
treated 110 (48%) subjects with AML (new diagnosis), 20 (9%) subjects with AML (first relapse), 9 
(4%) subjects with MDS, and 91 (40%) subjects with HSCT, as the primary diseases at study entry. 
200 mg (Part 1A), Serial PK evaluable cohort 
The predefined targets for dose selection for Part 2 were not achieved with the 200 mg dose.  Six (6) 
of 18 subjects (33%) attained Cmin between 200 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, and 12 of 18 (67%) attained 
Cmin between 500 ng/mL and 2500 ng/mL.

300 mg (Part 1b and Part 2), Serial PK evaluable cohort 
45  of  50  (90%)  subjects  attained  Cavg  between  500  ng/mL  and  2500  ng/mL,  and  5  of  50  (10%) 
subjects attained Cavg between 2500 ng/mL and 3750 ng/mL. No subject's Cavg fell below 500 ng/mL 
or exceeded 3750 ng/mL.  
The arithmetic mean Cavg at steady state was 1580 ng/mL and individual Cavg values ranged from 
510 ng/mL to 3450 ng/mL. Overall, the pre-defined exposure targets required for dose selection were 
achieved at the 300 mg dose level.The variability in exposure (AUC) was approximately 40%.

Individual Observed Posaconazole Cavg in Serial PK Evaluable Subjects Following 200 mg 
or 300 mg Multiple Dosing of Posaconazole Tablet 
In  Part  1  subjects,  a  strong  correlation  was  found  between  the  observed  Cavg  values  and  observed 
average  Cmin  values  (R2=0.92).  Using  the  serial  PK  data  from  both  Parts  1  and  2,  the  following 
formula  was  developed  to  predict  steady-state  Cavg  (predicted  Cavg,  pCavg)  using  observed  Cavg 
and trough values (Cmin) on Day 8:   
Predicted Cavg (pCavg) = 228 + 1.02 • Avg_Cmin. 
Using this linear regression model the pCavg could be derived from the observed average Cmin values 
obtained  at  steady  state  in  the  Cmin  PK-evaluable  cohort.  The  average  Cmin  was  calculated  as  the 
average of observed trough plasma values at steady state on Days 8, 14, 21 and Day 28/EOT: 
Predicted Cavg (pCavg) Evaluation 
Among 205 Cmin PK-evaluable subjects receiving 200 mg or 300 mg QD, the mean pCavg levels for 
200 mg and 300 mg (1010 ng/mL and 1970 ng/mL) in the Cmin PK-evaluable cohort were higher than 
the observed Cavg values on Day 8 in the serial PK-evaluable subjects (981 ng/mL and 1580 ng/mL).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Composite pharmacokinetic analysis 
The composite PK analysis included the 5 healthy volunteer studies (P04975, P05637, P07764, 
P07691, P07783) presented above and 1 patient study (P05615). The healthy volunteer studies 
included doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg for single dose data, and 200 mg and 400 mg for 
multiple dose (steady state) data. The patient study P05615 was analysed separately, with doses of 
200 and 300 mg administered QD (following BID dosing on day 1). 
The objective of this composite PK analysis is to evaluate the factors that affect single and multiple 
dose posaconazole pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and to estimate intra-and inter individual 
variability. Additionally, factors affecting posaconazole PK in patients were evaluated. 
All individual PK parameters were dose normalized to 100 mg and natural log transformed and 
evaluated in a linear mixed effects model including fixed effects of dose (since posaconazole PK is 
slightly less than proportional for doses higher than 300 mg), formulation, race, and gender, a random 
effect of subject within study, and covariates of age and weight. 
Population PK (popPK) model 
The primary objectives of the analysis were 
o  To develop a population PK model of posaconazole tablet using data in healthy volunteers and 
patients and quantify the variability of posaconazole exposure  
o  To perform covariate analysis to identify the demographic and clinical factors that might affect 
the exposure of posaconazole 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 38/75 
 
  
  
 
 
o  To conduct simulations to estimate the mean Cavg and Cmin and the percent of population 
with exposures above 500 ng/mL. 
This population PK analysis includes the data from the 5 healthy volunteer studies (P04975, P05637, 
P07764, P07783 and P07764) and 1 patient study (P05615). Only data from healthy volunteers and 
patients who were treated with posaconazole tablet were included. Data from all tablet formulations 
were used (tablet A, B, C, and D) with posaconazole tablet D as the final formulation. 
In total, 335 subjects (104 healthy volunteers and 231 patients (1 patient had one pre-dose sample 
and was thus not included in the PK analyses in the study) and 5756 observations were available for 
the analysis. 
Results 
The data were best described by a 1-compartmental model with a sequential zero first order 
absorption and a first order disposition from the central compartment. Model was parameterized in 
terms of clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V).The inter-individual variability was assumed log 
normal and inter-occasion variability on the absorption and bioavailability parameters was 
incorporated. Data were log transformed for fitting purposes. The residual variability was described by 
two parameters, one for the (clinical) phase 1 and one for the (clinical) phase 2/3 data. 
Covariate analysis showed 5 statistically significant covariates, 1 continuous (weight on F1) and 4 
categorical (Regimen on Clearance, food on KA (absorption rate constant), formulation and 
subpopulation on F1 (bioavailability) 
Model qualification showed that the model was adequate and robust and could be used for simulation 
purposes and calculation of the relevant exposure parameters (AUCô, Cavg, Cmin). Although the 
Cmax was underpredicted (more pronounced at single dose compared to multiple dose), the prediction 
of AUC0-T and Cmin was good with in most cases a slight overprediction. The model best describes the 
PK of posaconazole in the patient population. 
A food effect study has been recently conducted with the posaconazole 300 mg Tablet D after the 
initial submission. Hence, the original existing model has been updated by including the food effect 
data of P112.  
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 39/75 
 
  
  
Although food is now identified as a significant covariate on bioavailability in this updated popPK 
model, the table above shows that the estimates of all the other model parameters are quite similar in 
the updated popPK model relative to the original popPK model.  
The MAH concluded that  
  Posaconazole tablet pharmacokinetics can be modelled adequately with a 1- compartmental 
pharmacokinetic model with sequential zero/first order absorption. 
  Moderate variability was estimated for bioavailability (24 and 21% respectively for between 
and within subject variability) and clearance (38%).  
  Variability for the rate of absorption (Ka) was relatively high as there was limited data to 
support precise assessment of this parameter. 
Model predicted exposures for posaconazole tablet formulation 
The popPK model was developed from the available data on the tablet formulation. This open one 
compartmental population PK model with sequential zero/first order absorption model was 
subsequently used to simulate patient PK profiles and then model estimated AUC and Cmin were 
compared against observed values in order to evaluate the performance of the model for the target 
patient population. As indicated by the boxplot, the final PK model is able to simulate patient PK 
parameters comparable to the observed ones.

Boxplot comparing observed and simulated PK parameters in patients 
The population PK model developed for posaconazole tablet was used to simulate the 
pharmacokinetics of posaconazole in subjects at high risk for IFI and to assess the percentage of 
population with steady-state exposures above 500 ng/mL and 3750 ng/mL for 2 important 
parameters, Cavg and Cmin. In addition to 300 mg, alternate dose levels of 200 mg and 250 mg QD 
dosing (with BID dosing on Day 1) were simulated.

As there is no appreciable reduction in the proportion of subjects with very high exposures between 
the 250- and 300-mg dose and the known variability of posaconazole exposure would likely conceal 
any minor pharmacokinetic differences between these 2 doses, the MAH maintains that the 300-mg 
dose is the appropriate dose for consideration in both the prophylactic setting and as salvage therapy 
for refractory IFI.

Comparisons of exposures after single doses of the oral suspension and the tablet 
formulation 
In response to questions, the following comparisons were provided. For the single dose data, the 
observed concentration time profile for posaconazole tablet on Day 1, following 300 mg BID dose, is 
shown and compared with the observed concentration time profile for the posaconazole oral 
suspension on Day 3, following dosing as 200 mg QID (i.e., after 2 days of 200 mg QID dosing). This 
latter profile was selected because this is the best reflection of an early concentration-time profile with 
posaconazole oral suspension in patients at hand.

Additional Simulations to Evaluate Weight-based Dosing in Allogeneic HSCT Patients 
Further simulations with the population PK model, developed for posaconazole tablet have been 
conducted in order to evaluate if a subgroup of patients may benefit from a lower dose (200 mg) of 
posaconazole tablet. As it was agreed that exposure differences between 250 and 300 mg were 
generally small, only the lower dose of 200 mg was further evaluated.  
The simulation dataset included 1000 acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome 
(AML/MDS) subjects and 1000 HSCT subjects and the significant covariate (weight) identified during 
model development was included in the dataset. Three cut-off weights were chosen at the low end of 
the weight distribution, i.e. 50, 60 and 70 kg, representing approximately 5, 18 and 40% of the 
subjects included in the pivotal prophylaxis study of the posaconazole tablet (P05615). The 
simulations evaluated a 300 mg BID loading dose on Day 1 followed by 300 mg QD, and a 200 mg 
BID loading dose on Day 1 followed by 200 mg QD.  
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 46/75 
 
  
  
 
 
 
It is noted that the simulations are based on limited exposure data, in particular in the weight group 
≤50 kg, and therefore the simulated exposures in this weight group are considered less reliable.  
Further Simulations of the Effect of Food 
Results of the food effect study with the final market image (FMI) of posaconazole tablet show that 
when a single dose of 300 mg of posaconazole tablet is administered with a high fat meal, 
posaconazole exposure (AUC(0-last)) increased 51%, as compared to the exposure of a single dose of 
300 mg posaconazole tablet taken in a fasted state. When these data were included in the population 
PK model, the model describes a 56% increase in bioavailability when posaconazole tablets are taken 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 47/75 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
with a high fat meal, which is in concordance with the food effect that was observed in PN112. The 
estimated food effect is based on administration with a high fat meal which represents a worst case 
extreme of the potential food effect in patients receiving posaconazole as prophylaxis. It is likely that 
the food effect for lighter meals (i.e., lower fat) will be less than the ~50% effect observed. This effect 
is noteworthy because lighter meals are more typical for the patient population for whom this drug is 
indicated. By way of example, with posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg), AUC was increased by 2.6 
to 3-fold with a low fat meal and 4-fold with a high fat meal. 
It is not possible to simulate patient exposures with the population PK model under different food 
intake conditions, because the food status of patients included in P05615 is unknown. In fact the 
Applicant considers that it is likely that the range of exposures seen in P05615 actually captured the 
food effect in the target patient population, with exposures of AML/MDS patients and HSCT patients 
reflecting the lower and the higher end of the food effect, respectively. In study P05615, a ~30% 
higher plasma exposure of posaconazole was observed in HSCT patients as compared to neutropenic 
AML/MDS patients. Differences in plasma exposure between HSCT patients and the sicker, neutropenic 
AML/MDS patients may be related to their ability to take their dose with food (i.e., AML/MDS patients 
recently rendered neutropenic from cytotoxic chemotherapy also routinely suffer from severe nausea 
and anorexia, thereby limiting their food intake). Notably, the food effect largely falls within the 
moderate variability of posaconazole exposure in P05615 (CV% of approximately 40% in patients). 
However, in order to address this question to some extent, significant assumptions with regard to food 
intake in the clinical trial P05615 were applied to population PK to facilitate further simulations. The 
population PK model was used to simulate the exposure (Cavg) of a typical HSCT patient weighing 50, 
60, or 70 kg, receiving a 200 or 300 mg daily dose under different assumed food conditions. For the 
exposure estimation under different food scenarios, 2 significant assumptions were made. The first 
assumption was that during patient study P05615, each patient had taken posaconazole tablets with a 
high fat meal, and now for the simulation, the tablets are taken fasted (reducing the exposure with a 
factor representing a food effect of 1/1.56 (0.64) from the population PK model). The same was done 
for the exposure estimation for the second assumption of a fed condition, wherein it was assumed that 
each patient was dosed fasted during patient study P05615, and now for the simulation the tablets are 
taken with a high fat meal (increasing the exposure with a factor representing a food effect of 1.56 
from the population PK model).  
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 48/75 
 
  
  
 
Of  note,  in  Table  1.4,  the  “1”  value  represents  simulated  exposures  when  posaconazole  tablet  was 
taken without regard to food (the actual food intake status in patient study P05615). 
This table shows that, a HSCT patient weighing 50 kg, who now receives a dose of 200 or 300 mg with 
a high fat meal (assuming that he had fasted during study P05615), would obtain a Cavg of 2710 or 
4064 ng/mL, respectively. As expected, for a patient weighing 60 or 70 kg, exposures with the same 
food intake condition/assumptions are lower. On the other hand, if a HSCT patient weighing 70 kg 
now receives a daily dose of 200 or 300 mg under fasting condition (assuming he had taken high fat 
meals during study P05615), the Cavg would be 786 or 1181 ng/mL, respectively. As expected, for a 
patient weighing 50 or 60 kg, exposures under the same food intake condition/assumptions are 
higher. 
Applicability of data from the prophylaxis population to the treatment population 
While a relatively lower dose of posaconazole oral suspension was used in the pivotal prophylaxis trials 
(600 mg/day) compared to the treatment dosing (800 mg/day), overlapping exposures have been 
seen in patients with these two treatment regimens.

suspension (including the 2 trials in prophylaxis [P01899, C/I98-316] and 1 trial in treatment of IFI 
[P00041]) and the more recent posaconazole tablet study in prophylaxis (P05615).

2.5.2.  Main study (P05615) 
Pharmacokinetics and safety of solid oral posaconazole (SCH 56592) in subjects at high 
risk for invasive fungal infections. 
Methods 
This was a two-part, sequential, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, global study of the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole tablet when used as prophylaxis in adult subjects at high 
risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The study was conducted between 2009 and 2012. Patients 
were enrolled in 42 study centres in 15 countries:  
The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 
posaconazole tablet in a representative subject population. The secondary objectives of this study 
were (1) to evaluate the safety and gastrointestinal tolerability of posaconazole tablet in a 
representative subject population, and (2) to evaluate the steady-state posaconazole exposure in a 
representative population given posaconazole tablet. 
The study consisted of sequential parts 1A, 1B and 2.  
Part 1 enrolled neutropenic subjects undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 
or myelodysplasia (MDS). The treatment duration was to be up to 28 days, with a minimum duration 
of therapy of 8 days and a maximum duration of 28 days. Two different dosing groups were evaluated 
in Part 1. 
Part 1A: 200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg QD thereafter 
Part 1B: 300 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 300 mg QD thereafter 
The dose selection and decision to proceed to Part 2 were based on the posaconazole tablet exposure 
levels achieved and the safety observed among the Part 1 subjects.  
Part  2  enrolled  two  patient  populations.  Neutropenic  subjects  undergoing  chemotherapy  for  AML  or 
MDS and subjects who were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
Study Participants 
Eligible children were to be aged ≥ 18 years weighing more than 34kg with Anticipated (likely to 
develop within 3 days to 5 days) or documented prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 
[ANC] <500/mm3 [0.5 x 109/L]) at baseline and likely to last for at least 7 days due to standard 
intensive induction chemotherapy. 
The targeted sample size was 210 subjects. The determination of sample size was based upon the 
targeted number of subjects for evaluation of PK and safety as well as the anticipated discontinuation 
rate. 
The posaconazole plasma concentration-time data was determined by a validated liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 51/75 
 
  
  
 
In the study, there were a total of 230 treated subjects, 20 subjects were treated with posaconazole 
tablet 200 mg (Part 1A), and 210 subjects were treated with posaconazole tablet 300 mg (Part 1B, 
n=34; Part 2, n=176).  
A total of 237 subjects were screened for eligibility. 27 subjects who were screened but not enrolled 
(22 subjects) (i.e., screen failures) or enrolled but not treated (5 subjects). Failure to meet protocol 
eligibility criteria was the primary reason for which subjects were not enrolled 
Outcomes  
Clinical failure during the exposure was the secondary efficacy endpoint collected. There was no 
adjudication or review of IFI diagnosis. The reported IFI diagnosis was based upon investigator 
judgment. 
In the 200 mg Cohort, IFIs (proven or probable as determined by the investigator) were reported for 
2 subjects (10%) treated with posaconazole. Both subjects with an IFI in the 200-mg dosing cohort 
(Part 1A) died as a result of the infection within the protocol-defined follow up period of 65 days. The 
Cmin values for these patients  were reportedly 261ng/ml and 162ng/ml Cavg was not reported. 
There were no further deaths in the 200 mg Cohort. 
In the 300 mg Cohort, there was 1 subject (<1%) treated with posaconazole with a reported IFI 
(proven or probable as determined by the investigator). This subject was diagnosed with a fungal 
infection of the pleura (with abnormal radiograph on Day 8). Culture results reported the isolation of 
Candida glabrata. The subject's posaconazole concentration at the time of diagnosis of the infection 
was 2530 ng/mL. 
There were 9 additional subjects in the 300 mg Cohort identified by the investigator with a "possible" 
IFI. Abnormal radiographic findings were reported for all subjects with a diagnosis of a “possible” IFI; 
no mycological evidence of infection was identified in these subjects. In all cases, the investigator 
reported the presence of possible IFI for the analysis of clinical failure. 
The incidence of AEs associated with discontinuation of study drug was 18% for subjects in the 300-
mg dosing cohort. Early treatment discontinuation due to a possible IFI occurred with six (3%) out of 
the 18 subjects. Eighteen (9%) of the treated subjects were not alive at Day 65, the majority of which 
occurred in Part 2 of the study. Note there were two additional 300 mg subjects that had reported 
deaths after the Day 65 window (>70 days). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on bridging strategy, pharmacokinetics and exposure in 
patients and clinical efficacy 
Bridging strategy 
The PK/PD relationship for azoles in general and for posaconazole in particular has been studied in a 
murine model for candidiasis and a rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. For Candida, the 
PK/PD parameter most closely related with outcome in a murine model was shown to be AUC24/MIC. 
The Cmax/MIC ratio was also shown to be relevant. In clinical studies plasma concentration rather 
than AUC/MIC ratios have been used in an attempt to correlate exposure and response and Cavg is 
used as the bridging parameter. The plasma concentration curve for posaconazole at steady state is 
relatively flat due to the long half- life, and Cavg and AUC can be used interchangeably. Cavg is

derived by dividing AUCtau/tau.    
Scientific advice had been obtained from CHMP for the development of an intravenous solution of 
posaconazole. A development programme focusing on PK and exposure similarity between the 
approved formulation of posaconazole (oral suspension) and the proposed new formulation was 
agreed in principle.  
Exposure- response analysis from the pivotal trials for the oral suspension had indicated an 
association between lower plasma concentrations and clinical failure. The lower boundary (Cavg > 500 
ng/mL) for the pivotal tablet study (P05615) was selected based on the results of the exposure/ 
response analyses from studies with the oral suspension. While a exposure- response relationship 
seems plausible, and is supported by some in vitro data, clinical data are sparse. A clear target is 
difficult to establish. There is no identified exposure level separating clinical response from failure. In 
the pivotal prophylaxis trials mean Cavg were 583 ng/mL with 90% of patients attaining posaconazole 
average plasma levels (Cavg) ≥228 ng/mL (study P01899) and 1130 ng/mL with 90% attaining 
posaconazole plasma Cavg greater than or equal to 322 ng/mL (study C/I98-316). In the treatment 
trial, clinical results were best for patients in the 4th quartile, which had a steady-state Cavg mean of 
1250 ng/mL.  
It is agreed that the outcome in the upper exposure quartiles is better than in the lowers quartiles in 
the treatment study P00041. Due to the low number of events in the prophylaxis trials, such a trend is 
more difficult to detect. For this reason data were reviewed by using a composite endpoint as 
proposed by the FDA, which provided support for the 500ng/ml lower boundary. This method certainly 
increases the event rate, however by including mortality it does at the same time introduce further 
uncertainty in the evaluation, as this population has a relatively high mortality unrelated to fungal 
infections and their treatment.  
For the pivotal study with the tablet formulation, a target range of Cavg between 500- 2500 ng/ml 
was aimed for in 90% of subjects, as discussed in the CHMP scientific advice.  Considering all the data 
presented, and acknowledging the inherent difficulties, it seems reasonable to accept the proposed 
500ng/ml threshold as the lower boundary for both treatment and prophylaxis indication. 
The rationale for the upper boundary of the 500- 2500ng/ml target range targeted for 90% of the 
population was not well explained. While around half of the healthy volunteers had exposures around 
2500 ng/ml or greater, less than 5 % of patients had such exposures. The absolute upper boundary 
(Cavg < 3,750 ng/mL) was selected based on preclinical toxicology findings, specifically considering a 
possible effect of posaconazole on steroidogenesis, although the NOEL (Cavg 975ng/ml) for such an 
effect in monkeys is seen within the therapeutic range in humans and seems hence difficult to justify. 
Less than 7.5% of the healthy volunteers had exposures around 3750 ng/ml or greater, and such 
exposures had not been observed in any patient trials with the oral suspension.   
PK and exposure – study P05615 
This single arm Phase 1/III study aimed to establish the PK profile of the posaconazole tablet 
formulation and to provide bridging data to the oral suspension. Posaconazole tablets were given 
without regard to food in this study and food intake was not recorded.  Two dose levels, 200mg and 
300mg, were investigated using two different tablet formulations (C and D). 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014

Dense  sampling  was  performed  in  all  patients  in  part  1  and  a  subset  of  part  2  patients.  Sparse 
sampling (Cmin) was performed in the remaining subjects in Part 2. 
Data from dense (serial) sampling are available from 68 patients, of which n=17 were HSCT patients 
receiving a dose of 300mg and 51 patients with AML or MDS who received doses of 200mg (n=18) or 
300mg (n= 33). The 2 groups were analysed separately as in studies with posaconazole oral 
suspension, exposure was shown to be higher in patients with HSCT.  
At the 200mg dose level, investigated only for the group with the expected lower exposure 
(AML/MDS), PK target criteria were not met. At a dose of 300mg, 90% of AML/ MDS patients were 
within the target range of 500- 2500nm/ml, the remaining 10% had exposures > 2500 but < 
3750ng/ml, meeting the predefined criteria.  
There was a strong correlation between Cmin and Cavg in part 1 of the study. In part 2, sparse 
sampling (Cmin) only was performed, and Cavg was predicted based on this correlation (pCavg). The 
Cmin evaluable cohort included 205 patients. Here, predicted mean Cavg levels for 200 mg and 300 
mg (1010 ng/mL and 1970 ng/mL) were higher than in the group of serial PK-evaluable subjects 
(1970 ng/mL vs. 1580 ng/mL in the ). This may in part be due to an overestimation of Cavg in the 
upper exposure range and in part reflect a real difference between the populations as the underlying 
conditions differ.  
The lower limit exposure criteria were met; however the upper bound was exceeded. At a dose level of 
300mg, > 99% of had plasma concentrations of Cavg > 500ng/ml. However, 15% of patients had 
exposures > 2500 ng/ml, and 4% exceeded the upper threshold of 3750ng/ml. As expected from data 
with the oral suspension, HSCT patients had higher exposures on average an exceeded the target 
range more frequently.  
The MAH developed a population PK model, which was used to simulate 1000 HSCT and AML patients 
each, taking the identified relevant covariate of weight into account. The modelled data are in line with 
the study results. The upper end of the targeted range is exceeded in a relevant proportion of 
subjects. Patients after HSCT patients and or those weighing <72.5 kg are more likely to exceed the 
target exposure range. 
As the upper exposure target was exceeded with the 300mg dose, additional modelling was requested 
to evaluate doses < 300mg. These simulations indicate that the 200mg dose would indeed be 
expected to result in lower than targeted exposures in 8% of patients overall, while this number is 
reduced to 3.3% with 250mg and to 1% with the 300mg dose. The aim of the development program 
was the increase exposure and efficacy, which is justified by the high morbidity and mortality of IFI 
when they occur. The figures indicate that from an efficacy perspective, a dose of 300mg may be 
preferable, as may be expected.  It should however be remembered that the target exposure is 
derived from a limited dataset and the chosen cut-off of 500ng/ml is not a clear margin separating 
success from failure.  
Simulation results presented with the responses show that there is indeed a relatively small difference 
between patients achieving exposures > 3750 ng/ml between the 250mg and 300mg dose overall. 
The dose of 300mg may be the most appropriate dose at least for a proportion of patients. Apart from 
the underlying disease, weight has also been identified as a relevant covariate and a weight cut-off for 
a lower dose may decrease the number of patients with high exposures with relevantly affecting the 
lower margin.  Further simulations requested explored if this dose should be applicable to the whole 
target population. Those simulations suggested that a lower dose of 200mg in HSCT patients < 60 or 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 54/75 
 
  
  
70kg would lead to a lower proportion of patients exceeding the upper target range, although the 
difference is comparatively small. Separating the posology by weight alone would have been 
practicable; however, separating the dose in addition by weight seems less appropriate, in particular 
as it is not clear how other immunosuppressed patients not falling in either category should be treated 
(where posaconazole is used as a treatment, the target population includes all patients with an IFI). 
An added complicating factor is the observed food effect for the tablet formulation. In the pivotal 
study posaconazole tablets were given without regard food, yet the food effect study submitted with 
the responses indicates a 50% increase in AUC with a high fat meal. The effect may be less in clinical 
practice, where the majority of the target population may not take high fat meals, but it is not known 
how lighter meals may have affected exposure. The applicant’s position was that the effect of food is 
largely captured in the range of exposures seen due to the differences in food intake between the 
populations, which is likely correct to some extent. Additional simulations, covering the more extreme 
ends of the food related exposure spectrum were provided, showing that the risk of underexposure is 
below that seen with the presently approved formulation. A wording pointing out that exposure is 
increased by food intake is added to the SmPC.  
Applicability of data from the prophylaxis population to the treatment population 
While there are some uncertainties about the exposure targets in general, it is accepted in principle 
that the exposure targets set for the prophylaxis indication may be applied to the treatment indication 
based on the available data. However, several factors may lead to differences in exposure between 
prophylaxis and treatment populations: e.g. patients with rIFI may require different doses to achieve 
similar exposures due to reduced absorption due to the acute infection or PK parameters affecting 
exposure (such as Vd, CL) may be altered in acute infection. There may also be differences in 
concomitant medication. The currently approved dose for the oral suspension for the treatment rIFI is 
800mg/ day, while the approved dose for prophylaxis is 600mg/day. Despite the different doses, there 
is overlap in the resulting exposure between study 041 (treatment of IFI) when compared to 316 
(prophylaxis of IFI), which might suggest higher doses may be needed in the treatment population 
than in the prophylaxis indication to achieve similar exposures.  When dose normalised exposures are 
compared, it appears that there is little difference between mean exposure in the treatment study, 
which included patients with AML/MDS and HSCT (and others), and study P01899 (AML/MDS only), 
while mean exposure is lower than in trial 316 (HSCT only). The relative proportion of patients with 
HSCT or AML/MDS in study P00041 will have affected the overall result, and separate evaluation of 
these subgroups would contribute to the understanding of the comparative exposure.  
The main difference between the exposure not only in these subpopulations, but also between the 
treatment and the prophylaxis population, is considered to lie in the different ability to comply with 
dietary requirement, which is plausible. It is agreed that the reduced food effect seen with the tablet 
formulation can be expected to reduce the differences between the groups and provides support for 
the view that the same dose may be appropriate for both. The applicant provided data to suggest that 
the pathophysiological changes during infection are not likely to lead to relevant difference in exposure 
in the treatment population.  
Clinical efficacy 
This open, non-comparative study was not designed as a clinical efficacy study, but aimed to 
investigate the PK of the proposed tablet formulation of posaconazole in the target population for the 
prophylaxis indication and to provide additional safety data. The study population included patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 55/75 
 
  
  
with AML/MDS and HSCT with the aim to enrol patients representative of the target population for 
antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. A tabulated comparison of the baseline demographics 
between P05615 and the trials with the oral suspension indicated that the populations appear similar, 
and while some of the baseline covariates of possible relevance to exposure data were not evenly 
distributed between the studies (gender, race) as may be expected, these factors were not 
consistently shown to be relevant in the composite PK analysis.  
A PK target range of Cavg was set for study part 1, based on the results from previous trials with the 
oral suspension as a surrogate for the clinical outcome and PK results have been discussed earlier.  
The study design including lack of a control group and short study duration may be acceptable with 
regards to the primary endpoint, but limits safety data evaluation. The criteria for diagnosis of an IFI 
were not clearly presented and not adjudicated. 
The reported rate of breakthrough fungal infections was low. In the 200mg dose group, 2 of 20 
patients were clinical failures, and 1 failure occurred in the 300 mg dose group. Nine patients were 
identified to have possible infections; in 6 of these cases posaconazole was discontinued.  Of the 8 
cases which suspected or proven IFI for which plasma concentration values were available, 4 were 
below the exposure target of 500ng/ml, and 4 above. Available data are too limited to draw 
conclusions. 
In the pivotal prophylaxis trials in HSCT patients (C/I98-316), the reported IFI rate at 16 weeks was 
5% (16/301 subjects) with an average duration study drug of 84 days. The incidence of IFI in the 
pivotal trial in AML/MDS with posaconazole oral suspension (P01899) was 7/304 (2%); the average 
duration of treatment for subjects in this study was 22 days, but follow up was longer than in P05615.  
In summary, the reported incidence of IFI in this trial was low and appeared in line with earlier 
prophylaxis trials with the oral suspension, however treatment duration and follow up was shorter 
than in previous trials. As expected, no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on bridging strategy, pharmacokinetics and exposure 
in patients and the clinical efficacy 
The generated data suggest an exposure/response relationship, and such a relationship is biologically 
plausible. The lower boundary of 500ng/ml is an acceptable lower exposure target based on the 
limited data available. It does however not represent a cut-off clearly separating success from failure. 
The acceptability of the upper exposure target depends on the observed safety. 
Simulation results suggest that a dose of 300mg may be the most appropriate dose for the majority of 
patients. A lower dose of 200mg could reduce the proportion of HSCT patients <60kg exceeding the 
target range of Cavg. In view of the relatively small difference, the lack of confirmed safety problems 
from the available database so far, and the practical difficulties separating subpopulations explained 
earlier it seems preferable to apply the 300mg dose to the whole target population.   
The omission of recording the food effect in the pivotal study remains a flaw in the development 
programme of the tablet formulation, and the CHMP recommends that further information should be 
obtained in the on-going trial.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
A total of 334 subjects treated with posaconazole tablet were enrolled in clinical studies to support the 
registration of posaconazole tablet. This included 104 healthy volunteer subjects, who were enrolled in 
five Phase 1, single and multiple dose studies and 230 patients, who received a daily dose of either 
200mg or 300mg. Safety data were collected for all randomized subjects who took at least one dose 
of posaconazole or placebo to posaconazole. 
Safety data in healthy volunteers as summarised by the MAH are presented below: 
Of the 31 healthy volunteers who received multiple daily doses of posaconazole tablets of 200 mg, 
300 mg, or 400 mg following a BID loading dose on Day 1, 4 subjects (13%) discontinued treatment 
due to an AE that was considered possibly or probably related to study drug. The most common 
reported TEAEs after multiple dosing were hepatic enzyme increased (23%, all considered mild or 
moderate), diarrhoea (19%), and nausea (13%) which were all considered treatment related. There 
were no deaths or SAEs in any of the studies of healthy. The safety profile of posaconazole tablets in 
healthy volunteers was similar to the safety profile of posaconazole oral suspension in healthy 
volunteers. 
The overview focuses on the data from the 210 patients who received the proposed dose of 300mg/ 
day, for further data on the 200mg dose group (n=20) please see the Clinical assessment report.  
Patient exposure 
In the 300 mg cohort (n= 210), the mean and median duration of therapy was 23 and 28 days.

Adverse events 
In the 300mg cohort, nearly all subjects (99%) experienced at least one TEAE, the most common 
TEAEs (≥ 20% of subjects) included diarrhoea (29%), pyrexia (28%), nausea (27%), hypokalaemia 
(22%), and febrile neutropenia (20%). 40% experienced a treatment-related TEAE, the most common 
(>5% incidence) were nausea (11%) and diarrhoea (8%).  
In comparison, in the two randomized, comparative prophylaxis studies (P01899 and C/I98-316) of 
posaconazole oral suspension that enrolled a similar population to that enrolled in P05615, the most 
frequently reported TEAEs were fever (posaconazole: 45%, FLU: 47%), diarrhoea (posaconazole: 
42%, FLU: 39%), and nausea (posaconazole: 38%, FLU: 37%). The most common treatment-related 
TEAEs were nausea (posaconazole: 7%, FLU: 8%), diarrhoea (posaconazole: 5%, FLU: 4%), and 
vomiting (posaconazole: 4%, FLU: 5%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The most common AEs leading to death were from "infections and infestations", reported in 8 subjects 
(including sepsis and septic shock), and there were 2 subjects with reported renal failure as an AE 
leading to death. All of the AEs leading to death in the 20 subjects were reported as unlikely related to 
study drug. 
SAEs were reported for 69 (33%) of the 300 mg cohort. The most common SAE terms reported (≥4 
subjects) were 11 subjects with febrile neutropenia (5%), 5 subjects with sepsis (2%), and 4 subjects 
with diarrhoea (2%). SAEs considered related to posaconazole were reported for 6 (3%) patients. 
There were 2 (1%) subjects with treatment related SAEs of increased blood creatinine and drug 
reaction (suspected DDI with cyclosporine), 2 (1%) SAEs of abnormal liver function tests, 1 (<1%) 
subject with hepatotoxicity, and 1 (<1%) subject with renal failure. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs associated with discontinuation of study drug was 18% for subjects in the 300 
mg Cohort. There were 6 (3%) subjects with treatment failure that resulted in early treatment 
discontinuation. AEs considered related to posaconazole were reported in 11 (5%). The most common 
AEs (≥3 subjects) that led to discontinuation of study drug were nausea (2%), fungal infection (1%), 
and liver function test abnormal (1%).

Adverse events of special interest 
Hepatic Adverse Events 
Liver function test abnormality or hepatic enzyme increase were reported for 9 (4%) subjects treated 
as a part of the 300 mg Cohort. Seven (3%) of the subjects with liver function test abnormality or 
hepatic enzyme increase were classified by the investigator as having a related TEAE. Three of these 7 
(1%) subjects with a related TEAE of liver function test abnormality were discontinued from study.  
In addition to the 9 subjects with abnormal liver function tests or enzymes, hepatic TEAEs were 
reported by 10 (5%) subjects. This included 1 subject with hepatotoxicity TEAEs reported in both SOC 
categories. Four (4) (2%) subjects experienced severe or life-threatening hepatic TEAEs. Two met 
study criteria for Hy’s Law. Three of the subjects described above  were considered to have hepatic 
TEAEs possibly related to study drug, this included I case meeting Hy’s law criteria, one case of 
abnormal liver function test, and one case of “cytolytic” hepatitis, classed as severe. 
Cardiovascular events including ECG abnormalities 
In the 300 mg Cohort of P05615, cardiovascular TEAEs were reported by 11 (5%) subjects.  Three 
subjects had a cardiovascular TEAE that were judged to be related to study therapy. This included 2 
subjects with QTc prolongation >500, which was though the be study drug related, was associated 
with bradycardia and led to discontinuation in one case. Posaconazole trough concentration peaked at 
811 ng/mL on Day 3.Two cardiovascular events were reported as SAEs and led to drug discontinuation 
and death, but both of these were considered unlikely related to study drug.

Gastrointestinal events 
In the 300 mg Cohort of P05615, the most commonly reported gastrointestinal AEs included diarrhoea 
(29%), nausea (27%), vomiting (13%), abdominal pain (11%), and constipation (10%). A total of 54 
(26%) subjects experienced gastrointestinal AEs considered related to study drug. Of these, the most 
commonly reported events were nausea (11%) and diarrhoea (8%). Ten (10) (5%) subjects reported 
gastrointestinal AEs that led to study drug discontinuation. The most commonly reported 
gastrointestinal AEs that led to study drug discontinuation were nausea (2%) and diarrhoea (1%). 
There was one gastrointestinal AE (neutropenic colitis) that led to death. This event was not 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
For ALK-P, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, the majority of subjects' baseline values were Grade 0. For 
ALK-P and total bilirubin, the majority of subjects' values remained at Grade 0 throughout the study of 
the 300 mg Cohort. The largest shifts were three grade shifts, from Grade 0 to Grade 3 in 1 subject 
for ALK-P and 4 (2%) subjects for total bilirubin. For ALT, the majority of subjects' values either 
remained at Grade 0 (84 [40%] subjects) or had a minor shift of 1 grade (59 [28%] subjects from 
Grade 0 to Grade 1). For AST, the majority of subjects' values either remained at Grade 0 (110 [52%] 
subjects) or had a minor shift of 1 grade (61 [29%] subjects from Grade 0 to Grade 1). The largest 
shifts that occurred for ALT and AST were four grade shifts, from Grade 0 to Grade 4 in 1 subject for 
ALT or AST. 
There were 2 subjects, Subject No. 2/000179 and 50/000072, in the 300 mg Cohort of P05615 that 
met the protocol pre-specified criteria for significant hepatic effect consistent with Hy's law (ALT

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The posaconazole interactions seen with posaconazole oral suspension are also expected to occur with 
the posaconazole tablet. As has been shown with other azole antifungals, posaconazole is an inhibitor 
of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations and, thus, possesses the 
potential for drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In vivo, 
posaconazole does not significantly inhibit other human CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2E1, 
CYP2C8/9 and CYP2D6. posaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its 
Assessment report

concentrations are unlikely to be altered by inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP450 enzymes. 
posaconazole is metabolized via UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Phase 2 enzymes); therefore, inhibitors 
or inducers of this clearance system may affect posaconazole’s plasma concentrations. Posaconazole is 
a substrate and inhibitor of the transporter P glycoprotein (PgP), so inhibitors or inducers of the PgP 
system may affect posaconazole 's.

Subjects with high exposure versus low exposure 
These analyses were focused on the proposed 300-mg dose in an effort to eliminate any bias of the 
actual dosage administered (200 mg vs. 300 mg) on the safety assessment. Furthermore, in an effort 
to eliminate any effect of the predicted Cavg (pCavg) calculation on the exposure variable, the 
analyses were performed by classifying subjects based upon the actual observed steady state Cmin 
(trough) values rather than predicted Cavg.

In the Cmin > 3,750 ng/mL subgroup (Table 14-6 and Table 14-8), there were four adverse events 
that occurred in more than 1 subject; they were events of Hypertension (3 subjects), Alanine 
Aminotransferase Increased (AST; 2 subjects), Aspartate Aminotransferase Increased (ALT; 2 
subjects), and Blood Alkaline Phosphatase Increased (3 subjects). Most of these events were not 
related to study therapy (often due to extenuating circumstances) and/or resolved with continued 
posaconazole treatment; see the comment section of Table 14-9 for additional information regarding 
these AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience with Noxafil gastro resistant tablets. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The adverse event profile of posaconazole has been established for the oral suspension. Common 
adverse events include gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea and vomiting), abnormal liver function 
tests, electrolyte abnormalities and hypersensitivity reactions (rash). Hepatotoxicity is usually 
reversible, but rare cases of fatal hepatotoxicity have been reported. QT prolongation is known to 
occur and is a class effect of azoles.   
The pattern of the most common treatment-related AEs observed in this study was similar to the AEs 
seen with the oral suspension. The proportion of deaths, SAEs and of patients who had to be 
discontinued from treatment due to AEs was lower than in studies with the oral suspension in cross 
study comparisons. However, while exposure levels were higher with the tablet, overall treatment 
duration and hence cumulative exposure and follow- up was lower than in the studies with the oral 
suspension. There were also fewer patients with baseline laboratory abnormalities enrolled in this 
study. 
SAEs with at least a possible relationship to treatment were reported in 6 cases in the 300mg group, 
of which there were 2 cases of renal failure and 2 cases of abnormal liver function test. 
Hepatotoxic effects or abnormal lever function tests were reported from 18 patients, in 9 cases these 
were considered to be drug related. In 5 of these patients treatment was discontinued, and 2 met the 
criteria for Hy’s law. Posaconazole plasma concentrations were reported to be < 2500 ng/ml for all of 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014

the patients considered to have treatment related hepatic events, including those meeting Hy’s law’s 
criteria. Two patients with hepatic AE (of mild- moderate severity) considered unrelated had 
posaconazole plasma concentrations of around 3400ng/ml.  
QT prolongation led to drug discontinuation in one case. 
A positive association between exposure and overall treatment related AEs was not observed. The 
number of cases is however too small to draw firm conclusions. A slightly higher incidence of AEs was 
in fact observed in the first (lowest) quartile. This observation may be an indication that patients with 
lower exposure are those who are more unwell, leading not only to decreased absorption but also 
making them more likely to develop adverse events. There was no clear relationship between 
exposure and the most relevant adverse events, including abnormal liver function tests, although it 
does appear that compared to the oral suspension, hepatic adverse events were overall somewhat 
more common.  As a limiting factor, it must be stressed that in this population, attributing a specific 
adverse event to a specific treatment is very challenging indeed.  
The frequency of adverse events in patients with exposures above and below 2500mg/ml and above 
and below 3750ng/ml was compared in the 300mg dose group. Comparisons were based Cmin rather 
than Cavg. There was no clear increase in overall numbers of adverse events in those with exposures 
> 2500ng/ml. Hypomagnesaemia and abnormal liver function tests were more frequently observed 
with higher exposure, but there was no reported increase in grade 3 and 4 changes from baseline for 
the laboratory abnormalities. 
There were only 6 patients with Cmin> 3750ng/ml. Of these, 4 experienced treatment related AEs, 
three of which were severe and one of which lead to treatment discontinuation (for hypertension). 
There was 1 subject with moderately increased LFTs, judged to be treatment related but treatment 
was continued. In 2 other cases increased LFTs were considered unrelated (LFTs improved during 
continued treatment with posaconazole in one case, in the second case LFTs were elevated on Day 1 
of treatment.) 
Analysis of exposure by quartile and comparison of high (>2500ng/ml) versus low (< 2500ng/ml) 
exposure did not show an exposure related increase in overall AEs. There may be a higher number of 
patients with abnormal liver function tests and hypomagnesaemia, however an increase in higher 
grade laboratory abnormalities was not reported. The study results therefore do not show an 
unacceptable increase of overall or specific adverse events with higher exposures. However, the 
numbers of patients with high exposures (> 2500ng/ml) is small (n= 25), and the observed results 
have to be interpreted with caution. Most of the common adverse events seen with posaconazole can 
be monitored in clinical practice. Clear recommendations for monitoring and management of adverse 
events are included in the SmPC.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The lack of a control group and shorter duration of treatment makes the interpretation of the adverse 
events difficult. Based on the data presented, it appears that patients with higher exposures did not 
experience more or more serious adverse events than those with lower exposures. The number of 
patients with high exposures is however low.  
The majority of adverse events observed with posaconazole can be further monitored.

The safety database particularly where high exposures are concerned is currently small. The applicant 
was asked to suggest measures to collect further data to increase the safety database and generate 
further exposure-response data. At present, there is an on-going study PN069 aiming to recruit 600 
patients (50% of which will received posaconazole in tablet and or IV form) and investigating the 
efficacy and safety of posaconazole in the treatment of IFI. The study is expected to generate relevant 
additional safety data.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The RMP is 
acceptable. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 10, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for Noxafil in the treatment and prophylaxis of fungal 
infections (as detailed in section 4.1 of SmPC) is acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan: 
•  Safety concerns 
The MAH identifies the following safety concerns 
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 66/75 
 
  
  
Table 1: Summary of safety concerns 
With the introduction of a new formulation, the possibility of medication errors due to 
substitution between the different formulations, which could result in under-dosage or over-
dosage, has been identified as an important potential risk.   
The PRAC Rapporteur agrees that the safety concerns listed by the MAH are appropriate. 
•  Pharmacovigilance plans 
With the exception of medication error as described above, review of the posaconazole tablet data 
indicated no new safety concerns arising with this new formulation. The planned pharmacovigilance 
actions will remain the same as currently in place for the posaconazole oral suspension. 
There are no additional pharmacovigilance activities proposed for posaconazole.  
The PRAC Rapporteur, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that routine 
pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC Rapporteur also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness 
of the risk minimisation measures 
•  Risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC Rapporteur considered that important safety concerns for posaconazole, including the 
newly-identified risk of medication error, can be efficiently minimised through routine risk 
minimisation measures. 
The summary table provided in the RMP includes not only risk minimisation measures but also refers 
to pharmacovigilance. This should be corrected in the next version of the RMP.

The PRAC Rapporteur, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that the 
proposed risk minimisation measures remains sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indications.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
In addition, it was noted that the on-going study PN069 is referred to in the RMP.  Having agreed that 
additional exposure-related safety data will be collected part of the on-going study PN069, the CHMP 
noted that the RMP will be updated accordingly at the next opportunity and part of the on-going line 
extension to IV procedure.   
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The proposed gastro-resistant tablet formulation has improved absorption when compared to the 
currently approved oral suspension in a population of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
Compared to the oral suspension, the effect of food on absorption is significantly reduced, which is a 
distinct advantage in the target population, a proportion of which will not be able to comply with food 
intake requirements of the oral suspension. 
When given as a single daily dose of 300 mg without regard for food, mean posaconazole exposure 
from the tablet is expected to exceed a Cavg of 500 ng/ml, which is considered to be associated with 
higher rates of clinical success in the treatment and prophylaxis of IFI.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No controlled, adequately powered clinical efficacy trial was conducted with the new formulation. The 
development  programme  was  based  on  an  observed  exposure-response  relationship  in  clinical  trials 
with  the  oral  suspension  and  relies  on  limited  data  due  to  low  case  numbers.  The  chosen  efficacy-
related exposure target of more than 500 ng/ml is not a clear cut-off separating failure from success. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Posaconazole  has  an  established  adverse  effect  profile  which  includes  gastrointestinal  side  effects 
(diarrhoea and vomiting), abnormal liver function tests, electrolyte abnormalities and QT prolongation. 
These effects are seen with both the oral suspension and the tablet.  
Assessment report  
EMA/159150/2014 
Page 72/75 
 
  
  
The  study  data  and  model  derived  simulated  data  indicate  that  a  relevant  proportion  of  patients  will 
exceed plasma concentrations of 2500 ng/ml and also the upper target limit of 3750 ng/ml. There are 
limited safety data for these exposure levels, as they were seen to a lesser extent - or not at all - in 
the studies with the oral suspension. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  review  of  the  safety  data  did  not  show  any  unexpected  adverse  events  compared  to  previous 
studies with the oral posaconazole suspension. However, the value of new safety data generated with 
the  tablet  formulation  in  supporting  this  application  is  limited  by  the  lack  of  a  control  group.  The 
company provided data to demonstrate that patients with higher exposures do not experience more or 
more  severe  adverse  events  than  those  with  lower  exposures,  however  less  than  50  patients  were 
observed with exposures > 2500 ng/ml and only 6 with > 3750 ng/ml. Confounding causality factors 
for adverse events in the target population contributes to difficulties in data interpretation. 
PK  and  safety  data  stem  from  patients  with  AML  and  MDS  or  those  after  HSCT  who  received 
posaconazole for prophylaxis. No data were generated for patients with other underlying diseases and 
active fungal infections.  
It has been established that the gastro-resistant tablet does have a food effect (50% increase in AUC 
with  a  high  fat  meal).  This  was  not  taken  into  consideration  in  the  pivotal  trial,  where  posaconazole 
was administered without regard for food. This may affect the generalizability of the trial data.  
Balance 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the evidence provided, the benefit risk balance for the proposed dose of 300 mg is 
considered positive for Noxafil gastro-resistant tablets.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The proposed daily dose of 300 mg is appropriate in a large proportion of patients, but due to the high 
PK variability some patients may experience unnecessarily high exposures. Extensive explorations and 
simulations for dose adjustments have been provided. It was hypothesised that a lower dose of 
200mg could reduce the proportion of HSCT patients <60 kg exceeding the target range of Cavg. 
Nevertheless, in view of the relatively small difference, the lack of confirmed safety problems from the 
available database so far, and the practical difficulties separating subpopulations explained earlier it 
seems preferable to recommend the 300 mg dose to the whole target population.   
The omission of recording the food effect in the pivotal study remains a flaw in the development 
programme of the tablet formulation, and the CHMP recommended that further information on food 
intake as well as plasma concentrations over time and when possible plasma concentrations at the 
time of adverse events should be obtained in the on-going PN069 trial.  
Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that the improved absorption and higher exposure provided by 
the proposed gastro- resistant tablet, with the implied beneficial effect for efficacy, outweighed the 
risk of higher exposure in a proportion of patients. This conclusion takes into account that further 
Assessment report

efficacy and in particular safety data are generated in the on-going clinical trial in the treatment of IFI 
with posaconazole.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Noxafil 100 mg gastro-resistant tablet in the treatment of the 
following fungal infections in adults (see section 5.1): 
- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole 
or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are 
intolerant of amphotericin B; 
- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole or 
in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; 
- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or 
fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
Refractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days 
of prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. 
Noxafil is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients: 
- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high 
risk of developing invasive fungal infections; 
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose 
immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing 
invasive fungal infections.

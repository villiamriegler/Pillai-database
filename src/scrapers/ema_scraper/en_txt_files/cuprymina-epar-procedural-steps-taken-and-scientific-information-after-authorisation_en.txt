SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II and PL 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Cuprymina in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
PL section 1 should be revised in line with the SPC section 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Cuprymina in the approved indication remains favourable, 
but recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
The very limited exposure to Cuprymina (cumulative total 
sales of 152 vials in the EU) is considered to be grounds for 
requiring an additional five-year renewal.  This would 
enable the generation of further data which would provide 
assurance that any risks for this product have been 
detected and adequately characterised in the post-
marketing setting.

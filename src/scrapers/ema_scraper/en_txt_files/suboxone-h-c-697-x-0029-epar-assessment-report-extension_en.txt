sublingual tablets.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Suboxone is a fixed combination product consisting of buprenorphine and naloxone formulated as a 
sublingual tablet. It is approved for the substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a 
framework of medical, social and psychological treatment. Treatment is intended for use in adults and 
adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be treated for addiction. 
In accordance with the approved posology, up to a maximum of 24 mg buprenorphine can be dosed 
daily. As Suboxone is currently only available as 8/2 mg and 2/0.5 mg sublingual tablets, higher dose 
levels require multiple tablets. This line extension application introduce new dosage strengths; 12/3 
mg and 16/4 mg, which aimed to minimise the number of tablets a patient would require for dosing. 
During the evaluation, the Applicant has withdrawn the 12/3 mg tablet as the study comparing this 
dose with the equimolar combination of currently marketed tablets did not demonstrate 
bioequivalence.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as 16mg/4 mg immediate release sublingual tablets containing a 
fixed dose combination (4:1 weight ratio) of buprenorphine (as hydrochloride) and naloxone (as 
hydrochloride dihydrate) as active substances.   
Assessment report  
EMA/774165/2015  
Page 6/21 
 
 
 
 
This strength is introduced as a line extension to the already marketed Suboxone 2mg/0.5mg and 
8mg/2mg sublingual tablets. 
Other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, mannitol, maize starch, povidone K 30, citric acid 
anhydrous, sodium citrate, magnesium stearate, acesulfame potassium and natural lemon and lime 
flavour. 
The product is available in Paper/Aluminium/Nylon/Aluminium/PVC blister packs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substances used for the manufacture of the new strength are the same as those used for 
the already-authorised presentations. Minor changes were made to the active substance section as 
part of this line extension but these are administrative in nature and do not impact the quality of the 
finished product. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Suboxone 16mg/4mg sublingual tablets were developed with the aim of producing a formulation 
delivering an equivalent sublingual dose of buprenorphine as the existing buprenorphine sublingual 
tablets, but with a reduced potential for intravenous abuse. Since the combination of naloxone, an 
opiate antagonist, with buprenorphine an opiate partial agonist is an established strategy for reducing 
potential of IV misuse, a fixed dose combination was pursued. 
Two strengths of Suboxone, namely Suboxone 2 mg / 0.5 mg and 8 mg / 2 mg sublingual tablets, are 
currently authorised in Europe. The posology scheme of these tablets supports dosing up to 24 mg 
buprenorphine daily. These dose levels currently require the administration of multiple tablets. In order 
to reduce the number of tablets a patient would require to take daily and thus increase convenience 
and compliance, two additional strengths, Suboxone 12 mg / 3 mg and Suboxone  
16 mg / 4 mg tablets, have been developed and were initially presented in this line extension 
application. 
Specifically, the quality target product profile (QTPP) was for sublingual immediate release tablets 
containing 12 mg buprenorphine / 3 mg naloxone and16 mg buprenorphine / 4 mg naloxone, 
differentiated from the other strengths by shape and/or tablet size and embossing, bioequivalent to 
the already EU authorised Suboxone strengths, containing the same excipients, packaged in child 
resistant blisters and stable for at least 36 months under ICH long-term storage conditions 
(25°C/60%RH and 30°C/75%RH). 
The new tablet strengths contain the same excipients as the current formulations of Suboxone, 
sublingual tablets registered in Europe (EU/1/359/001-4). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The in vitro dissolution profiles of the two new strengths were compared with the previously-approved 
strengths using the registered dissolution test method. As more than 85 % is released within 15 
minutes, the dissolution profiles are deemed to be similar (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 rev. 1.). 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that is used for marketing. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been satisfactorily demonstrated.

The primary packaging is blister packs Paper/Aluminium/Nylon/Aluminium/PVC. The material complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
As mentioned under pharmaceutical development section, the manufacture of Suboxone 16 mg/4 mg 
tablets was based on the registered manufacturing process of the already approved Suboxone 2 
mg/0.5 mg and 8 mg/2 mg tablets. 
In general, the manufacturing process consists of three main steps: wet granulation, tabletting and 
packing. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, identification of buprenorphine and naloxone (HPLC, TLC), buprenorphine content (HPLC), 
buprenorphine content uniformity (HPLC), buprenorphine related impurities (HPLC), naloxone content 
(HPLC), naloxone content uniformity (HPLC), naloxone related impurities (HPLC),  water content (Karl 
Fischer), mean tablet weight (gravimetric), dissolution of buprenorphine, dissolution of naloxone, 
disintegration time and microbiological quality  (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results are provided for four commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, 
through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of each of the proposed tablet strength stored under 
long term conditions for up to 24 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Supporting stability data from tablets used for clinical studies packed in foil without a child resistant 
closure stored for up to 25 months at 30 °C / 65% RH and 9 months at 40 °C / 75% RH were also 
presented. 
Further supporting stability data on three batches each of the already registered strengths, Suboxone 
2 mg/0.5 mg and 8 mg/2 mg, stored at 30 ºC / 65% RH for up to 24 months were also provided. 
Samples were tested for appearance, identification of buprenorphine and naloxone, buprenorphine 
content, buprenorphine related impurities, naloxone content, naloxone related impurities, mean tablet 
weight, dissolution of buprenorphine, dissolution of naloxone, disintegration time, water content and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No out of specification results or trends were observed for any of the measured parameters at any of 
the conditions tested. Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 3 years as stated in the SmPC 
is acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted with this line extension application.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The introduction of the additional strength is not expected to significantly increase the use of Suboxone 
in the treatment of opioid addiction. Consequently, the Environmental Risk Assessment does not need 
to be updated.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
NA 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed in support of this application. This was considered 
acceptable as the route of administration and the pharmaceutical form remain unchanged.  The higher 
strength sublingual tablets are within the maximum daily dose and the posology recommendations are 
not affected.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
To support this application, the MAH conducted 2 bioequivalence studies of the new dosage strengths. 
However, only one study is discussed below to support the new strength 16/4mg Suboxone. 
Study RB-UK-12-0007 evaluated bioequivalence of the newly proposed 12/3mg tablet with the 
equivalent dose obtained with a combination of the current marketed product.  
The application for the 12/3mg strength was withdrawn by the MAH during the evaluation and results 
of study RB-UK-12-0007 will not be discussed further in this report.  
Study RB-UK-12-0008 evaluated 2 formulations of the 16/4 mg dosage strength, one hexagonal and 
one circular. Marketing authorisation was sought for the circular formulation only.  
No further studies related to bioavailability or efficacy were submitted and none were required. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study RB-UK-12-0008 
Methods 
This was a randomised, single dose, open label, cross over study in healthy volunteers, using the 
currently marketed Suboxone 8/2 mg tablets as a reference. Treatment periods were separated by a 
washout period of at least 14 days. 
All study treatments were administered under the tongue until they dissolved.   
Blood (plasma) pharmacokinetic characteristics were assessed after each dose of study medication. 
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at the following times: 0 h (predose), 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 
0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h post dose. 
Study populations 
The study was conducted in opioid-naive and/or nondependent healthy volunteers under a naltrexone 
block in order to improve the tolerability of the study drugs.  
The study enrolled healthy Caucasian adult subjects.  44 of them were male and 4 female and all were 
non-smokers. The mean age was 34.3 years (range 18-55 years) and the BMI range was 19.7-29.9 
kg/m².

Pharmacokinetics variables 
Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf were calculated for the actives and metabolites, respectively.  
In addition, AUC0-72h was calculated for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. 
Analytical methods 
Plasma concentrations for the actives and metabolites were determined using a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Maximum storage time for samples was  
90 resp. 87 days. All samples were analysed within the 404 days demonstrated long-term storage 
stability in human plasma containing tripotassium EDTA at -20 °C.  
3088 original human plasma samples, containing tripotassium EDTA were analysed. To demonstrate 
reproducible quantitation of incurred subject samples, approximately 10% of the study samples were 
re-assayed. Incurred sample repeats were considered acceptable if the original and re-assay values 
from two-thirds of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of  
≤ 20%. The results of the incurred sample repeats met the acceptance criteria. 
Statistical analysis 
Comparison of the natural log-transformed PK parameters Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf, for the actives 
and metabolites, and AUC0-72h, for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, across treatments was 
performed using a mixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and Schuirmann’s two 1-sided t-
tests procedure. The ANOVA model included sequence, treatment,  
and period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. The ratios of the 
geometric means (A/B) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported after back exponentiation. 
An analysis following the CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence was also performed. 
In this analysis, fixed subject within sequence effect was used in the ANOVA models and other aspects 
and result presentation were kept similar. Subjects with paired data for a particular parameter (ie, 
from both treatment periods) were included in this analysis. 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated if the 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios (test/reference) for 
Cmax, AUClast, AUCinf, and AUC0-72h were entirely contained within the predefined no-difference interval 
of 80% to 125%.

Of the 48 subjects who were randomized, 45 subjects completed all treatments and were included in 
the PK population. Three subjects failed to complete all 144-hour PK assessments and were excluded 
from PK analyses. 
Mean buprenorphine concentrations over time are presented on linear scale in Figure 1 below.  
In Treatment A, Treatment B, and Treatment C, the mean buprenorphine concentrations rose to a 
peak between 1.00 and 1.25 hours and declined bi-exponentially through 144-hours post dose. 
Of the 45 subjects in the PK population, 39 subjects receiving Treatment A, 40 subjects receiving 
Treatment B, and 38 subjects receiving Treatment C had quantifiable buprenorphine plasma 
concentrations throughout the 144-hour observation period. 
The statistical analysis of the buprenorphine PK parameters is presented in the Table 1 below.  
No difference in buprenorphine AUCinf, AUClast, AUC0 72h, and Cmax was observed when comparing 
both test treatments (Treatment A and Treatment B) to the reference treatment (Treatment C) since 
all the 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios were contained within the predefined equivalence 
limits of 80% to 125%.

Mean naloxone concentrations over time are presented on linear and semi-logarithmic scales in the 
Figure 2 below. For Treatment A, Treatment B, and Treatment C, mean naloxone concentrations rose 
to a peak at approximately 0.75 hours and declined thereafter. Of the 45 subjects in the PK population, 
42 subjects receiving Treatment A, 44 subjects receiving Treatment B, and 41 subjects receiving 
Treatment C had quantifiable naloxone plasma concentrations 12 hours post dose. By 24 hours post 
dose, the majority of subjects receiving all treatments had naloxone plasma concentrations that were 
BLQ.

No difference was observed in naloxone AUC last and Cmax comparing Treatment B (test) to 
Treatment C (reference) since the 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for these parameters were 
contained within the predefined equivalence limits of 80% to 125%. 
However, the 90% CI of the geometric LS mean ratio for naloxone AUCinf comparing Treatment B to 
Treatment C was partially contained with these limits. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The purpose of this application was to introduce additional dosage strengths of Suboxone, whilst 
maintaining the current posology of up to 24 mg buprenorphine daily. In order to justify this 
application, the new dosage strengths were expected to demonstrate bioequivalence to an equivalent 
dose obtained with a combination of the current marketed product.  
The concept of conducting a single dose BE study under fasting conditions was acceptable and in 
accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1/Corr**).  
Elimination of buprenorphine is bi-or tri-exponential, and has a mean half-life from plasma of about 33 
hours. The elimination half-life of the dealkylated metabolite norbuprenorphine with weak µ-agonist 
intrinsic activity is even longer (40-50 hours). Therefore, the chosen wash-out period of 14 days was 
long enough to cover the minimally required five elimination half-lives in order to avoid carry-over.  
Tmax was expected at about 1.5 hours, based on data obtained for already approved SL tablets. Eight 
samples were taken within the first two hours post-administration in order to allow an accurate 
calculation of Tmax.

The bioanalytical method for determination of buprenorphine and naloxone plasma concentrations was 
adequately validated. Standard statistical methods and acceptance criteria for bioequivalence were 
applied. 
Following oral administration, naloxone is barely detectable in plasma due to high first pass 
metabolism. Following sublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, naloxone plasma 
concentrations are low. No systemic pharmacological activity of naloxone is expected or desired.  
Equally, norbuprenorphine was shown not to exert marked pharmacodynamic effects after 
administration of SL buprenorphine formulations. In line with the provisions of the Bioequivalence 
Guideline, the decision upon bioequivalence between the two dosage forms will mainly focus upon the 
results for the parent compound buprenorphine. 
In line with Bioequivalence Guideline provisions, the 90% CIs for the primary PK parameters AUCt and 
Cmax were required to comply with the 80-125% acceptance criteria. Bioequivalence for AUClast and 
Cmax was demonstrated. The fact that the upper limit of the acceptance range was exceeded for 
AUCinf of naloxone (116.22; 90% CI 105.20 – 128.40) does not compromise the conclusion of 
bioequivalence between the newly developed 16/4 mg SL tablets and the established 2 x 8/2 mg SL 
tablets. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the results of the submitted bioequivalence study, the new 16/4mg SL tablet formulation 
(circular) is considered bioequivalent with the combination of two 8/2 mg SL tablets.  
Clinical safety 
Safety data were collected from the PK data package submitted in support of this application.  
The studies were performed under a naltrexone block to reduce opiate-related adverse events (AEs). 
Patient exposure 
A total of 98 subjects participated in the studies.  
Safety was assessed by monitoring of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiograms. 
Adverse events 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10% incidence in all subjects) by system organ class were 
typical for the opioid therapy and included nervous system disorders (such as headache, somnolence, 
and dizziness) and gastrointestinal disorders (such as nausea and vomiting). 
There were no trends in vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, or oral 
examinations that were considered clinically significant. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths or Serious Adverse Events in the studies.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data do not indicate any new or unexpected toxicities or safety concerns for the newly 
developed tablet formulations. No changes to the safety information for Suboxone are considered 
necessary. 
The CHMP noted that addition of new high dose strength increases the risk of respiratory 
depression/arrest in case of medication errors, paediatric intoxication, misuse and abuse. Furthermore, 
the high dose strength could increase the misuse of high doses of buprenorphine.  
The MAH provided an overview of current risk minimisation measures which have been assessed to be 
adequate. Consequently, no further updates to the RMP were deemed necessary.   
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall frequency of TEAEs does not point to a general difference in the safety profile between the 
newly developed and the currently marketed sublingual tablets. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the MAH fulfils the legislative 
requirements. 
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 11 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 11 with the following content:

2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The 
line extension to add Suboxone 16/4mg strengths using the same route of administration and 
pharmaceutical form has identified no additional safety issues and therefore the MAH defers to the 
existing consultation report. No further user testing was deemed necessary. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
The Suboxone Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) states that up to a maximum of 24 mg 
buprenorphine can be dosed daily. As Suboxone is currently only available as 8/2 mg and 2/0.5 mg 
sublingual tablets, the higher dose levels currently require multiple tablets. Availability of the newly 
developed Suboxone 16/4 mg dose is expected to facilitate treatment by minimising the number of 
tablets patients would require for dosing. 
Risks 
The addition of new high dose strength 16/4 mg increases the risk of respiratory depression/arrest in 
case of medication errors, paediatric intoxication, misuse and abuse. Furthermore, the high dose 
strength could increase the misuse of high doses of buprenorphine. However, the current risk 
minimisation measures remain sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit-risk balance of the newly developed 16/4 mg sublingual tablet is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and bioequivalence, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Suboxone 16/4mg as substitution treatment for opioid drug 
dependence, within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

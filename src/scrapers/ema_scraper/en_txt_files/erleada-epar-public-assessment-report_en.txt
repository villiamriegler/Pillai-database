2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Apalutamide is intended for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 10/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite castrate levels 
of testosterone while on treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa), or 
following bilateral orchiectomy. This disease was previously known as hormone-refractory prostate cancer until 
research demonstrated that the majority of these resistant cancers overexpress the AR and may remain 
sensitive to more potent hormonal agents than those approved at the time (e,g., first generation antiandrogens 
such as flutamide or bicalutamide) [Chen et al, 2004]. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom), it is estimated that NM-CRPC represents 7% of all 
prostate cancer cases based on a patient flow model. The model predicts that the 5-year prevalence will increase 
in the future from 89,810 patients in 2016 to 110,290 patients in 2026. 
In the United States (US), the incidence of NM-CRPC has been estimated to be 50,000 to 60,000 men per year, 
with a 34% annual rate of progression to metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), with rapidly rising PSA [ie, a PSA doubling 
time (PSADT) of ≤10 months] conferring greater risk. Of NM-CRPC patients, 33% developed bone metastasis 
within 2 years. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer represents a spectrum of disease with risk for development 
of metastases, particularly for those patients with a PSADT ≤10 months.  It is also defined by a castration level 
of serum testosterone (ie, <50 ng/dL), rising PSA, and no evidence of metastatic disease.  
Men with a PSADT of ≤10 months are at the highest risk for developing imminent metastatic disease and prostate 
cancer-specific death. Androgen-receptor signaling remains active even with castration levels of serum 
testosterone. Molecular profiling studies of CRPC commonly show increased AR gene expression. This 
underscores the emerging view that current androgen-depletion strategies are incomplete, and that residual 
androgen contributes to sustained AR activity and disease progression. 
For patients with PSADT nearing 10 months and whose PSA kinetics are accelerating, the window of opportunity 
to prevent metastases is small and could be missed. Moreover, current treatment guidelines do not offer 
recommendations for PSA testing. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Currently, patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who have rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels 
despite definitive and salvage local therapy are frequently treated with either medical or surgical castration 
therapy, aimed at blocking AR signalling. Patients initially benefit from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) but 
the disease eventually progresses after approximately 12 to 48 months. Resistance to ADT is largely driven by 
reactivation of AR signalling through persistent adrenal androgen production, up-regulation of intratumoural 
testosterone production, modification of the biologic characteristics of ARs, and steroidogenic parallel pathways. 
Although high-risk non-metastatic CRPC (i.e., for patients with a short PSA doubling time) is a disease state, 
current treatment options are limited. Per a provisional opinion from the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO), second-line hormonal therapy (e.g., antiandrogens, cytochrome P450 [CYP] 17 inhibitors) may be 
considered in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC at high risk for metastatic disease (based on a short PSA 
doubling time or rapid velocity), but otherwise this treatment is not suggested [Virgo et al, 2017]. Similarly, the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends first-generation antiandrogens (e.g., 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 11/139 
  
  
bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide), second-generation novel hormonal therapies (enzalutamide, abiraterone), 
ketoconazole, corticosteroids or diethylstilbestrol as second-line hormonal therapies [NCCN, 2017]. The 
European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines advise ADT and watchful waiting [Parker et al, 2015]. 
About the product 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the lack of maturity of long-term variables 
including Overall Survival and the absence of a beneficial effect on Quality of Life that cannot substantiate the 
claim that apalutamide addresses to a significant extent an unmet medical need and that it is of major public 
health interest. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 60 mg of apalutamide as the active 
substance.

6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of apalutamide is 4-[7-[6-cyano-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl]-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5, 
7-diazaspiro[3.4]octan-5-yl]-2-fluoro-N-methylbenzamide, corresponding to the molecular formula 
C 21H15F4N5O2S. It has a relative molecular mass 477.43 g/mol and has the structure shown in Figure 1.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 12/139 
 
 
 
  
  
Figure 1. Chemical structure of apalutamide. 
Apalutamide appears as white to slightly yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble 
in aqueous media over a wide range of pH values. Its pKa was determined to be 9.7 (acidic carboxamide 
moiety) and its partition coefficient (Log P) is 2.89 (pH 7.0). 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic methods (UV, 
IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectrometry), elemental analysis, DSC and TGA. Apalutamide is sufficiently 
characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated. 
Apalutamide is an achiral molecule. It exhibits polymorphism, with Form B being the thermodynamically most 
stable form of apalutamide under the relevant crystallization and storage conditions of the active substance. 
The active substance synthesis process was designed to consistently deliver Form B. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Apalutamide is manufactured through a five step synthesis reaction and purification process. The choice of the 
starting materials (SMs) is in line with previous CHMP Scientific Advice and the justification for all three was 
provided in accordance to ICH Q11. They were therefore considered acceptable and are controlled by 
appropriate specifications. 
The intermediates are controlled by appropriate specifications. The applicant has performed a criticality 
assessment of quality attributes. It was done in order to determine the critical quality attributes (CQA). All CQAs 
have been selected and justified taking into account the quality target product profile (QTPP). Critical steps and 
process parameters have been identified and for all critical process parameters (CPPs), proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) were established.  Overall the control strategy is satisfactory and ensures the consistent quality 
of the final active substance. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance 
with the relevant ICH guidelines. Detailed information on the origin, fate, and control of the actual synthesis and 
carryover impurities was provided. Carry-over studies of potential impurities coming from starting material to 
the final active substance were conducted. Taking into consideration the above, the conclusion is that the 
manufacturing process is capable to remove these impurities. Solvents which are used in the last step of the 
synthesis, are controlled in the active substance specification.  
The mutagenicity assessment showed that two impurities belong to the ICH M7 class 3. For both impurities it has 
been shown that they are satisfactorily controlled. 
Two solvents are known carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds, but based on purging factor considerations 
under the applicable process conditions they are not expected to occur in the final active substance at levels 
above their acceptable limits, and therefore do not require specific control actions.

Two different synthetic routes were used during process development: synthesis method 1 and synthesis 
method 2. The synthesis method 1 was not a commercially viable route; therefore synthesis method 2 was 
developed. Three different versions of synthesis method 2 were developed. The commercial route of 
apalutamide active substance is clearly defined. Differences between the different versions of synthesis 
methods were discussed and justified. 
Apalutamide active substance is packaged in double, antistatic, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, which 
are closed appropriately with a twist-tie or equivalent. The bags are placed in a closed container (plastic drum, 
fiber drum, or equivalent). The container closure system intended for commercial packaging of the active 
substance complies with the current European guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials 
CPMP/QWP/4359/03, including Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on Plastic Materials and Articles Intended to Come 
into Contact with Food. The packaging material is controlled by acceptable in house specification. The suitability 
of this container closure system is demonstrated by the active substance stability data. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specifications  reproduced  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification (IR), assay (UHPLC-DAD), chromatographic purity (UHPLC-DAD), residual solvents (GC-FID) and 
sulphated ash (USP). 
The specifications for release and stability testing of the active substance have been established in accordance 
with ICH Q6A. The justifications for the selection of the specification parameters, the selection of the test 
methods and the setting of the acceptance criteria are based on relevant development data, pharmacopoeial 
standards, test results from representative active substances batches generated with the proposed test 
methods and results from long-term and accelerated stability studies. Additionally, a reasonable range of 
expected analytical and manufacturing variability is considered, taking into account the limited amount of data 
available to date. The proposed levels for the impurities are considered adequate and have been qualified by 
relevant toxicological studies. 
Rationale for the absence of particle size specification was considered justified. 
A risk assessment for the potential presence of elemental impurities in the active substance was conducted in 
accordance with the ICH Q3D, taking into account potential contributions from manufacturing equipment, 
container closure system (primary packaging), processing water and elements intentionally added during the 
synthesis process. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment and the results of three representative 
commercial scale apalutamide batches it was shown that all elements are well below 30% of the ICH Q3D option 
1, and therefore no testing for elemental impurities has been included in the active substance specification. 
Based on the available development data and the general nature of the synthetic process employed the routine 
microbial purity testing of the active substance is considered not necessary and therefore no test for microbial 
purity is included in the specification. 
The  analytical  methods  used  for  the  control  of  the  active  substance  are  adequately  described  and 
non-pharmacopoeial methods have been validated. Information regarding the reference standards used in the 
analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch results were presented for 13 batches manufactured during the course of development, by the proposed 
commercial process. All batches meet the proposed commercial specifications. Results for batches

manufactured by the other processes were also presented. In all cases, the batches comply with the 
specification proposed at the time of release. 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH and 30 °C / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines. 
In addition, long term stability data for up to 24 months on another three production scale batches 
manufactured at the synthesis development site using a previous synthesis method, which however is 
representative for the final commercial method, were also presented. 
As the available long term stability data on commercial batches does not cover the proposed re-test period at the 
time of approval, the applicant commits to continue the stability studies post-approval for the active substances 
batches under long-term storage conditions 25 °C/60% RH and 30 °C/75% RH, in accordance to the protocols 
presented in 3.2.S.7.1. 
The following parameters were tested in stability studies: appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, water 
content and solid state. Microbiological purity was tested at the beginning of long term study and once a year at 
25°C/60%RH and, once a year at 30°C/75%RH. The test methods used for stability testing are the same as the 
proposed commercial test methods. The following test methods: water content by Karl Fischer, solid state by 
XRD, and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12) are only used for the stability studies. Method description and 
validation reports for the water content method and method description report for the solid state method are 
provided. The test results for all batches, in all storage conditions and time points comply with the proposed 
specifications and no significant stability related changes or trends have been observed for any of the tested 
parameters. The polymorphic form of the apalutamide active substance is maintained during storage. 
Photostability was investigated according to ICH Q1B. Both protected and unprotected samples were stable 
when exposed to light. Nevertheless, the applicant wishes to apply the storage condition “store in original 
package to protect from light” as a precaution measure. As there is no impact to the end user of the finished 
product neither to the pharmaceutical distribution chain, no objection is raised and the proposed storage 
condition is accepted. 
Forced degradation studies on the active substance in solution under stress conditions of thermal acidic, thermal 
alkaline, thermal oxidative, neutral, dry heat, humid heat, and metal ions were performed. Results from the 
forced degradation studies including assay and chromatographic purity results and mass balance calculations in 
the form of table were presented. The active substance was found stable under neutral conditions and when 
exposed to metal ions. Apalutamide is prone to minor degradation under strong acidic and thermal conditions 
and unstable under alkaline and strong oxidative conditions. The primary degradation process of the active 
substance was described and the stability indicating nature of the UHPLC method for related substance and 
assay was shown. 
Based on the available stability data a retest period of 30 months is accepted. The storage labelling should state 
“Store in original package” to protect from light. The active substance does not require any special temperature 
storage conditions.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Erleada is an immediate release, oblong shaped, greenish film-coated tablet of 16.7 mm length, debossed with 
“AR 60” on one side. Each film-coated tablet contains 60 mg of apalutamide. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) for Erleada was defined as an immediate-release, oral, film-coated 
tablet, containing minimum 60 mg of apalutamide for dosing a maximum of 4 tablets a day, enabling a daily 
dose of 240 mg; the finished product must have a sufficiently low level of impurities and microbial burden, with 
a shelf life of minimum 24 months when packaged in blisters or bottles and stored at room temperature. 
Based on the low aqueous solubility observed across the studied pH range, and high intestinal permeability, the 
active substance is a class 2 compound according to the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) for the 
maximum dose of 240 mg per intake as per the SmPC. The low solubility of active substance (AS) in aqueous 
media was the main challenge of formulation development. In order to improve the bioavailability of this BCS 
Class 2 substance in Erleada, development focused on increasing the active substance’s aqueous solubility and 
dissolution rate. 
Development work started with a different pharmaceutical form and strength. Further investigations were made 
towards a more stable formulation of higher dosage strength. To manage the low aqueous solubility of 
apalutamide, enabling technologies were explored. Selected formulations of film-coated tablets were optimised. 
Several human bioavailability studies were performed to compare pharmacokinetic parameters.  
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The excipients 
are well known, conventional excipients for use in film-coated tablets. The active substance compatibility with 
the excipient used for the intermediate as studied and demonstrated under conditions relevant for the 
manufacturing of the intermediate. Compatibility with other excipients was demonstrated within stability studies 
of the finished product. 
Ensuring and maintaining the solid state of the intermediate is important for the bioavailability of the product. 
Therefore, the solid state of the intermediate has been monitored extensively at release and during stability 
studies of the intermediate and of the finished product throughout development. The solid state of apalutamide 
in the intermediate was characterised on representative batches manufactured by the development site as well 
as the commercial site. Different techniques, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy 
(IR), modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) and 
near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), were used. Data was also collected during storage at 25 °C/60% RH, 
30 °C/75% RH, and 40 °C/75% RH when packaged in the proposed container closure system (low-density 
polyethylene bag in an aluminum laminated bag). All available data show that the intermediate is stable during 
storage of the intermediate and during the manufacture and storage of the finished product in the proposed 
container closure system.  
It has been demonstrated that the particle size distribution of the active substance does not impact the 
manufacturability, quality, or performance of the finished product and that the particle size range studied of the 
intermediate does not have an impact on the in vivo performance of the finished product.  
The development of the dissolution method was described sufficiently and was subject of Scientific Advice given 
by CHMP. The proposed dissolution method has been optimised for the following parameters: medium pH, type 
of surfactant and its concentration in the medium and the paddle rotation speed. The developed dissolution 
method has demonstrated to be able to provide discriminating capabilities towards certain material attributes 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 16/139 
  
  
and process parameters and storage. Considering the provided information, the CHMP agreed that the proposed 
dissolution method is suitable for the routine quality control of Erleada finished product. 
The manufacturing process development was based on science-based criticality analysis approach that was 
performed to determine the manufacturing process steps and parameters that could influence quality attributes 
of finished product. This approach assigns criticality based on process parameter and material attribute impact 
on the finished product Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). The CQAs are derived from the QTPP and patient 
impact (safety, efficacy, and therapy compliance). A comprehensive criticality analysis was conducted to 
determine an appropriate control strategy for the drug product CQAs. Based on the development knowledge and 
using quality risk management tools as described in ICH Guideline Q9, the drug product manufacturing process 
was systematically evaluated to determine which process parameters and material attributes can potentially 
impact the CQAs of the finished product. The criticality of the process parameters and material attributes were 
assigned based on their impact on the finished product CQAs within potential operating ranges. The identified 
critical process parameters (CPPs), critical material attributes of active substances or excipients (CMAs), and 
critical attributes of finished product intermediates (CINT) were evaluated against the risk of CQA failure. Based 
on the outcome of this evaluation, a risk-based control strategy was proposed. 
Process parameters and their proven acceptable ranges were selected based on identified risks. The ranges were 
developed and studied at both pilot and commercial scaled batches. Successful transfer from development sites 
to commercial manufacturing sites, as well scale-up from pilot to commercial batch sizes were performed. The 
only difference between the commercial tablets and the tablets used in the primary stability studies and pivotal 
clinical phase 3 trial is a debossment. In order to demonstrate equivalency in the quality and performance of the 
clinical phase 3 batches with the primary stability and commercial site batches, an in vivo and an in vitro 
comparison have been performed. 
The finished product is packaged in bottle or blisters. The blisters are made of opaque polyvinyl chloride- 
polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PVC-PCTFE) foil blister with an aluminium (Alu) push-through foil. The bottles are 
white, opaque, 160-mL high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant polypropylene (PP) 
closure and induction seal liner containing silica gel desiccant (6 g silicon dioxide in total).  
The selected container closure systems for the finished product as well as for the intermediate (LDPE in Alu 
laminated Bag) comply with the relevant Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on Plastic Materials and Articles Intended 
to Come into Contact with Food and European guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials 
(CPMP/QWP/4359/03). 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Erleada film coated tablets manufacturing process of the finished product is a multistep process comprising 
preparation of intermediate, pre-blending, granulation, post granulation blending and lubrication, film-coating 
and packaging.  
The critical controls for the finished product manufacturing process have been determined using a science-based 
criticality analysis approach. The approach assigned criticality based on process parameter and material 
attribute impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs). Assessment of the criticality of process parameters 
identified two critical steps. Although no impact of the manufacturing process parameters on the CQAs of the 
finished product has been observed within the studied ranges, the process parameters related to the 
manufacture of the intermediate are designated as CPPs as they can affect stability and dissolution. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018

The manufacturing process contains one drug product intermediate for which the specification was provided and 
justified. NIR test methods will be used to determine water content and solid state of the active substance in the 
intermediate. A stability study of the intermediate demonstrated that no changes in appearance, assay, 
degradation products, water content, solid state by XRD is observed over a period of 12 months. Stability data 
of two bulk film-coated batches have also been submitted. These data support the proposed 12 months hold 
time for bulk film-coated tablets packaged in a closed low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag in a heat-sealed 
aluminium (Alu) laminated bag placed in a closed container (plastic drum, fibre drum or equivalent). 
The manufacturing process has been validated on three batches of film coated tablets at commercial scale. The 
intermediate manufacturing process was also validated in three consecutive validation batches for the intended 
commercial batch sizes. All validation data generated met the acceptance criteria and confirm that the process 
is well controlled and that product of consistent quality is manufactured. 
Product specification 
The finished product release  and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and acceptance criteria for 
this product type; description (appearance and tablet dimension, visual and measurement, respectively), 
identification (UHPLC, UV), assay (UHPLC), chromatographic purity (UHPLC), uniformity of dosage forms 
(UHPLC), dissolution, water content (Karl-Fischer, NIR), solid state (NIR) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The specifications for release and stability testing have been established in accordance with ICH Q6A. 
The justifications are based on relevant development data, pharmacopoeial standards, test results from 
representative finished product batches generated with the proposed test methods and results from long-term 
and accelerated stability studies. Additionally, when setting the specifications, a reasonable range of accepted 
analytical and manufacturing variability was also factored in, taking into account the limited amount of data 
available to date. 
Characterization, mutagenicity, and toxicological qualification information for the specified degradation product 
and synthesis impurity  has been presented. No other actual degradation products have been observed at or 
above the ICH Q3B reporting threshold of 0.1% (maximum daily dose of apalutamide is 240 mg) during release 
or long-term stability testing of the finished product packaged in the proposed container closure system. No 
potential degradation products have been observed at or above the ICH Q3B identification threshold of 0.2% 
during accelerated stability studies (40 °C/75% RH) or confirmatory photostability studies. Therefore, in 
alignment with ICH Q3B and ICH M7, no additional toxicological qualifications and mutagenic assessments are 
required. 
A test for solid state by NIR spectroscopy is included in the finished product specification. The limit proposed for 
this parameter, at release and shelf-life, is supported by the batch analysis results and by the stability data. 
NIR spectroscopy is also used to determine water content in the finished product. Changes outside of the 
approved scope (solid state and water content) of the NIR procedures are subject to variation application. 
A risk-based assessment was conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D, taking into account any potential 
contributions from the active substance, excipients, manufacturing equipment and container closure system 
into the finished product. Based on this assessment, testing of the finished product for elemental impurities is 
not necessary as the levels of elemental impurities from various sources are not expected to exceed the 
permitted daily exposure 30% threshold levels.

The finished product is released on the market following traditional final product release testing. The procedures 
for analytical methods used were provided. The non-compendial analytical methods were validated according to 
current ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on five commercial scale batches have been provided. All product batches were produced 
from active substance manufactured with the proposed synthesis method. All batches met the proposed 
commercial specification. In addition batch data from numerous batches manufactured during development has 
been presented and all results met the specification at the time of release. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from six batches manufactured at the commercial finished product sites packaged in both the 
proposed closure systems (bottles and blisters) and stored at long term (25 °C / 60 %RH), intermediate 
(30 °C / 75 %RH) and accelerated (40 °C / 75 %RH) conditions. Three of these batches are the primary stability 
batches that were made using active substance manufactured at the synthesis development site; the other 3 
batches are full commercial scale batches that were made using active substance manufactured at the 
commercial site by the final commercial synthesis process.  
Stability data for the primary stability batches packaged in bottles and blisters up to 24 months at long-term and 
intermediate conditions and for six months at accelerated conditions are available. 
Stability data for the full commercial scale batches, up to 12 months in HDPE bottles and blisters, under long 
term and intermediate conditions and up to six months under accelerated conditions are available. 
It is noted that storage conditions 30 °C / 75 %RH are not according to ICH guideline conditions, however, since 
the long- term (25 °C / 60 %RH) and accelerate studies (40 °C / 75 %RH) were performed according to ICH 
conditions and the product does not show any instability, this slight deviation is no cause of concern. The 
stability studies will be continued post-approval for product batches under long-term storage conditions 
(25 °C / 60 % RH and 30 °C/75% RH), in accordance to the protocols presented in 3.2.P.8.1. 
The stability batches were tested for appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, dissolution, water content, 
solid state and microbiological purity. The test methods used for stability testing were the same as the proposed 
methods for release specification, except for one additional test of solid state by XRD. The method description 
and validation report for the XRD method is provided. The analytical methods were shown to be stability 
indicating by testing products subjected to forced degradation studies. The results met the specifications and no 
substantial stability related changes or trends were observed during storage of the product at the different 
storage conditions.  
The same six stability batches were studied under stress conditions at 50 °C through 3 months of storage. A 
slight  increase  in  one  specified  degradation  product  and  total  degradation  products  was  observed  at  stress 
conditions. However, all the specified, unspecified, and total degradation products were within specifications. 
Moreover, to challenge the solid state stability of the finished product, an open dish stability study under 
stressed conditions (high temperature and humidity) was performed. All data available to date confirm that the 
solid state of the finished product is very stable, when packaged in the proposed container closure system and 
stored at long-term storage conditions. Although open dish studies have demonstrated that the water content of 
the finished product has no impact towards the solid state under long term storage conditions, a moisture 
protective container closure system is part of the control strategy to prevent water uptake by the finished 
product during storage and additionally ensures that the product will meet the proposed chromatographic 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018

purity, dissolution, and solid-state finished product specifications throughout shelf life. Therefore, the 
applicant’s proposal to maintain the storage condition of “Store in original package in order to protect from 
moisture” (SmPC 6.4) is acceptable. 
In addition, since a hold time for the intermediate has been established, two pilot finished product batches were 
manufactured at the development sites using aged intermediate batches and have been placed on stability 
under ICH recommended storage conditions (i.e., end-to-end stability). The intermediate batches, packaged in 
its commercial container closure system, had been stored for 12 months at 30 °C/75% RH before being 
processed into finished product. The packaging of the batches were the same as intented for marketing (HDPE 
bottle and PVC-PCTFE/Alu blister). Stability data from the two pilot finished product batches produced from 
intermediate previously stored for 12 months (end-to-end stability) met the specifications upon storage under 
long-term and accelerated conditions. It is therefore justified in line with the requirements defined in the 
Guideline EMA/CHMP/QWP/24074/2015) to calculate the expiry date of the finished product from the date that 
the intermediate is mixed with the tablet excipients. 
An in-use stability study has been performed that simulates the daily use of the product by the patient. In-use 
stability data on finished product in HDPE bottles at the initial time of the primary stability batches was 
presented. After opening and closing during the 30-day in use period, results for all tested parameters: 
appearance, water content, solid state, solid state by XRD and NIR, assay, chromatographic purity and 
dissolution meet the proposed commercial shelf-life specification. Furthermore the applicant commits to conduct 
in-use stability study at the end of shelf life of these batches according to the protocol presented in 3.2.P.8.1. 
The currently available stability data indicate that the finished product remains stable for 6 weeks at 
25 °C /60% RH and 30 °C / 75 % RH during the in-use studies at the initial time point when stored in the 
proposed commercial packaging. Considering the demonstrated stability profile of the product, it is not 
considered necessary to specify an in-use shelf-life for the finished product in HDPE bottles in the SmPC. 
A photo-stability study has been conducted according to ICH Q1B on the three commercial scale stability 
batches. The product is not considered as sensitive to light and no special storage condition is warranted with 
regard to protection from light. 
Based on the overall stability data presented the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and the storage condition “Store 
in original package in order to protect from moisture” (SmPC 6.3 and 6.4) is accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical program was consistent with the proposed indication (non-metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer), route of administration (oral) and dosing regimen (240 mg/day). The nonclinical development 
program adhered to the requirements of the ICH S9 guideline on Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer 
Pharmaceuticals. The nonclinical safety package included chronic toxicity and male fertility assessment. For 
nonclinical safety pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicology evaluations, the rat was chosen as the rodent 
species and the Beagle dog was chosen as the non-rodent species based, in part, on the similarities in the in vitro 
and in vivo metabolic profile between these species and human. Species selection for pharmacodynamic and 
safety evaluations was further supported by pharmacological/toxicological effects on androgen-dependent 
reproductive organs of adult male animals. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant has conducted primary pharmacodynamic studies to demonstrate binding and inhibitory 
properties of apalutamide against the AR, selectivity versus other nuclear HRs, mechanism of action in prostate 
cancer cells, and the pharmacodynamic and antitumor effects of the molecule in animal models. 
Apalutamide was shown to bind directly to the AR in competition binding studies in LNCaP/AR(cs) cells with an 
affinity of 16 nM. However, absolute binding affinities of apalutamide for the androgen receptors of rat, mouse 
and dog were not determined. The homology of amino acids sequence of ligand binding domain of the protein 
among species supports binding affinity of apalutamide to AR could be similar across species. The Applicant 
claims that determination of relative AR binding across species is not expected to have an impact in the 
interpretation of preclinical or clinical findings, which is endorsed based on studies in vivo. 
Apalutamide is shown to be selective for AR versus other nuclear HRs and does not have agonist activity in the 
absence of androgen.  
It has been demonstrated that apalutamide impairs nuclear translocation of the AR in LNCaP/AR(cs) cells, 
inhibits AR binding to the enhancer regions of AR-dependent genes (PSA and TMPRSS2) and antagonizes 
androgen-mediated induction or repression of mRNA expression levels of 13 AR-regulated transcripts 
(TMPRSS2, PSA, CaMK2N1, AMIGO2, PLD1,NOV, BDNF, STEAP4, ORM1, SLUG, HPGD, FKBP and NCAPD3). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 21/139 
 
 
  
  
Clinically relevant effects mediated by induction or repression of AR-regulated transcripts were characterized in 
in vivo pharmacology and toxicology studies. 
In in vitro studies, apalutamide was found to be more potent than the first-generation AR inhibitor, 
bicalutamide, and was found not to have agonist activity observed for bicalutamide. Apalutamide was also found 
to be comparable to enzalutamide (in in vitro studies. 
Apalutamide at ≥10 mg/kg showed dose-responsive antitumor activity in castrated mice bearing LNCaP/AR(cs) 
xenografts tumors. The efficacy of apalutamide was also compared to bicalutamide and enzalutamide. While the 
effect of bicalutamide in this model was largely restricted to growth inhibition rather than tumor regression, 
apalutamide and enzalutamide, at the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day), caused tumor regressions greater than 
50%. However, at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, apalutamide demonstrated superior efficacy versus enzalutamide as 
measured by the fraction of animals exhibiting more than 50% reduction in tumor volume. Greater efficacy was 
observed for apalutamide despite lower exposures of apalutamide relative to enzalutamide at this dose.  
Mutations in the ligand-binding domain of AR have been described in 10% to 20% of patients who have 
progressed on the first-generation antiandrogen therapies as flutamide and bicalutamide (e.g., L701H, W741C, 
H874L, T877A) and have also been associated with resistance to next-generation AR-directed therapies such as 
enzalutamide and apalutamide (AR F877L and AR T878A). Additionally, different studies have shown ARF876L 
mutation converts AR antagonists to agonists. Clinical relevance of mutation associated to enzalutamide and 
apalutamide resistance (ARF877L) has been assessed in clinical trials and results suggest that ARF877L 
mutation is very less prevalent in NM-CRPC setting and expected to have minimal clinical impact to apalutamide 
treatment. 
Four metabolites of apalutamide identified in preclinical species (metabolite M1, JNJ-56142047 [M2], 
JNJ-56142060 [M3] and JNJ-56142021 [M4]) were assessed for their on-target effects against the AR. 
Metabolites M1, M2 and M4 were approximately 30-fold less potent against AR than apalutamide. Metabolite M3 
was the most potent AR inhibitor, but was still 3-fold less potent than apalutamide. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed to assess the potential of apalutamide to interact with 
different receptors, channels and transporters. Apalutamide and metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have been 
shown to be inhibitors of the GABAA-gated chloride channel at clinically relevant concentrations (IC50 of 3.0 and 
3.2 μM, respectively). Additionally, in a tissue-based functional assay for the GABAA receptor, an apalutamide 
IC50 of 0.88 μM was determined. Other minor metabolites including M1, JNJ-56142047 (M2), and 
JNJ-56142021 (M4) were considered inactive with respect to off-target GABAA effects. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Seizures/convulsions have been observed at high apalutamide doses in general toxicology studies in dogs (≥ 25 
mg/kg/day) and mice (≥ 175 mg/kg/day) and are considered to be mediated by off-target inhibition of GABAA 
currents. The NOAEL determined in these studies for convulsions were 10 mg/kg/day in dogs and 100 
mg/kg/day in mice, which represent low safety margins (2.2 and 1.3 for apalutamide and the metabolite M3, 
respectively, based on Cmax values) to discard the risk of seizures in patients. In fact, seizures have been also 
observed in patients treated with apalutamide and enzalutamide and the effect is described in the SmPC. 
Next to seizures, other CNS-related clinical signs were noted after repeated doses in dogs (e.g. tremors, wobbly 
gait, ataxia) at non-tolerated doses (≥25 mg/kg/day). The NOAEL (10 mg/kg/day) for CNS effects determined in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 22/139 
  
  
the 13-and 39-week repeat-dose toxicology studies in dogs provides a safety margin of 4.3 for apalutamide and 
1.5 for the metabolite M3, or 6.5 and 2.4 considering the difference in protein binding between species and 
based on AUC values. No test article-related CNS effects were observed in a full functional observation battery 
(FOB) assessment or in the 26-week toxicity study in male and female rats at doses (up to 150 mg/kg) 
exceeding the apalutamide clinical exposure level approximately 5-fold (or 8.5 -fold considering the difference 
in protein binding between species). The systemic levels of JNJ-56142060 (M3) were not determined in the FOB 
study, but toxicokinetic data from the 26 week toxicity studies indicate that exposure level to M3 in rats 
receiving 150 mg/kg of apalutamide is much lower than level reached in human treated with 240 mg/day (0.2 
fold). Thus, the M3 exposure in animals (rats and dogs) at the NOAEL for CNS effects compared to the clinical 
exposure is considered to be low to disregard the risk of developing CNS effects in patients. However, as the 
incidence of tremor, gait disturbance, and ataxia was low and similar between the treatment arms (placebo and 
apalutamide) in the Phase 3 clinical Study ARN-509-003, additional non-clinical studies are not required. 
On the other hand, cognitive and memory impairment have been associated to hormonal deprivation, but no 
evidence of impairment has been found in nonclinical and clinical trials with apalutamide. 
Noteworthy, the inhibition of the 5-HT2B receptor-ligand interactions was 25% at a concentration of 10 μM. 
Activation of 5-HT2B receptor agonists has been associated with the valvular heart disease (Rothman RB et al., 
Circulation, 2000). Rothman RB et al. has concluded that medications with serotonergic activity and their active 
metabolites should be screened for agonist activity at 5-HT2B receptors and that clinicians should consider 
suspending their use of medications with significant activity at 5-HT2B receptors (Rothman RB et al., Circulation. 
2000, Rothman RB and Baumann MH, Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2009).  The risk for valvular heart disease risk due 
to 5-HT2B binding activity of apalutamide and its metabolite is considered low based on the binding affinity of 
apalutamide to 5-HT2B receptor is considered low and the concentration 10 μM was 19-fold higher than the free 
steady-state efficacious plasma exposure in man at a dose of 240 mg per day, pivotal toxicology studies in rats 
and dogs revealed no signs of apalutamide or its major metabolite M3 treatment related cardiac pathologies and 
the histopathologic examinations of the heart valves revealed no valvulopathies and the incidence of valvular 
heart disease observed in clinical Study ARN-509-003 was lower in the apalutamide arm than in placebo. 
Apalutamide and M3 inhibited the hERG current at concentration that exceeded clinical exposure by 7 fold. But 
they did not prolong action potential in canine Purkinje fiber assay at concentrations around 50 times the 
anticipated unbound Cmax plasma exposure of apalutamide and metabolite M3 in men with CRPC treated with 
apalutamide at 240 mg/day. Apalutamide at 3 and 10 µM, but not at 30 μM, induced a statistically significant 
(P<0.05) reduction in APA at a 2s BCL (Mean; 0.5 and -1.7 mV, respectively) and the shape (slope) of the 
apalutamide curve differs quite remarkably from those of vehicle control and metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3). 
These changes are not supported by the other parameters that characterize the action potential as inhibition of 
the Na+ or the Ca2+ channels and changes in the heart rate and PQ interval in telemetry study in dogs, and 
therefore are considered biologically insignificant. The changes of the slope of the apalutamide curve are 
clarified by the biological variability of the cell content within Purkinje fibre. 
Apalutamide was also evaluated for possible cardiovascular effects following single oral administration in 
conscious telemetered dogs. Following administration of apalutamide at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, correlation 
between apalutamide and prolonged QT interval were observed 2 hours post dose. This finding is considered 
coincidental due to the inter-individual variation within the group and individual pre-dose variations and thus, no 
clinically relevant.  
A dedicated respiratory safety pharmacology study in rats did not reveal any concerns following a single-dose 
administration of apalutamide.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical pharmacodynamic interaction studies were not conducted with apalutamide. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical studies of the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and its M3 and M4 metabolites were conducted after 
both single- and repeat-dosing in CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs. 
The oral formulation used in most of the PK/TK evaluations of apalutamide was a nonaqueous lipid-based 
solution of apalutamide. It is the same formulation as the apalutamide drug product used in the in vivo 
pharmacodynamic studies and in the early clinical studies (ie, softgel capsules, 30 mg). The Marketing 
Authorisation Application (MAA) is for 60mg immediate –release oral film-coated tablet. Pharmacokinetic 
profiles of both formulations have not been directly compared in non-clinical species, but in the dog formulation 
study, a formulation prototype of the currently marketed tablet had an relative bioavailability (Frel) of 117% 
compared to the soft gel capsule. Since most toxicities found in animals were observed at doses that provide low 
safety margins to disregard the effects in patients, minimal increment in bioavailability of the drug with the new 
formulation does not alter the relevance of the safety data provided. Moreover, the tablet and capsule 
formulations were demonstrated to be bioequivalent in a human relative bioavailability study. 
In mice, rats, and dogs, apalutamide is a low clearance molecule (0.5 to 1.3 mL/min/kg) with a moderate 
volume of distribution (2.1 to 2.8 L/kg). Oral bioavailability of the lipid-based emulsion was high in the mouse 
(93% at 3 mg/kg) and approximately 100% in the dog (at 10 mg/kg). It was not assessed in the rat. 
Following single dose, apalutamide, M3 and M4 displayed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a wide range 
of doses in mice and rats including and above the therapeutic range. In dogs, systemic exposure for apalutamide 
increased slightly more than dose-proportional over the entire dose range (5-40 mg/kg), systemic exposure of 
M3 was slightly less than dose-proportional between 2.5 and 10 mg/kg and slightly more than dose-proportional 
between 10 and 20 mg/kg and systemic exposure of M4 was more than dose-proportional between 2.5 and 5 
mg/kg and dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg/kg. At lower doses of repeat administration in rats, 
exposure to apalutamide was generally dose-proportional, but at higher doses exposure to apalutamide did not 
increase or was less than dose-proportional, whereas metabolite exposure continued to rise and was often 
greater than dose-proportional. Clinical exposure of apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide were 
approximately dose proportional over the apalutamide dose range of 30 to 480 mg per day (0.125 to 2 times the 
recommended dosage). 
Exposure (both Cmax and AUC) was lower after repeat administration than after single dosing in mice but 
accumulation of apalutamide, M3 and M4 was evident in rats and dogs after repeat doses. In dogs, 
concentrations were similar on Days 28, 91, 182, and 273 indicating that steady-state had been achieved by 
Day 28. 
M3 and M4 peak plasma concentration were delayed in mice (24-48 hours) and dogs (21-72 hours) compared to 
apalutamide peak plasma concentrations (2-8 hours). However, maximum plasma concentrations of 
apalutamide, M3 and M4 were achieved between 8 and 12 hours postdose in rats. 
Metabolites to parent ratios increased with dose in rats, they were not dose dependent after single 
administration in dogs and they decreased with increasing doses after longer exposure in dogs. 
The pharmacokinetics appear to be comparable between male and female mice and dogs. However, exposure of 
apalutamide was higher in females than in male rats and differences in exposure increased after repeat dose, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 24/139 
  
  
whereas M3 levels were higher in males than in female rats. The effect of sex on exposure is not relevant 
because apalutamide is only indicated in men.  
Apalutamide was widely distributed throughout with maximal concentrations in most tissues 4 to 12 hours 
postdose. Radioactivity was greatest in abdominal and brown fat, liver, kidney cortex and medulla, adrenal 
cortex, pancreas, and Harderian gland and lowest in the lens of the eye, brain and bone surface. A small amount 
of residual radioactivity was retained in the skin 504 hours postdose. Binding of drug-related material to melanin 
is unlikely because radioactivity levels in pigmented tissues were comparable to the nonpigmented skin and 
there was no retention of radioactivity in the uveal tract. Concentrations of apalutamide, M3 and M4 were 
approximately dose proportional in brain. Concentrations of apalutamide and M3 in plasma were dose 
proportional in mice and greater than dose-proportional in dogs. Apalutamide and M3 brain-to-plasma ratios 
were lower in mice (31.5-43.9% for apalutamide and 47.0-50.6% for M3 at 24 hours postdose) and rats (76 % 
for apalutamide and 53% for M3) than in dogs (~1 for apalutamide and 1.1-1.4 for M3). 
The free fractions of apalutamide and M3 in plasma samples were, respectively, 8.2% and 9.4% in mouse, 7.2% 
and 8.6% in rat, 6.3% and 8.2% in dog, 11.4% and 13.2% in rabbit, and 4.2% and 5.1% in human at 
concentration over a test range of 0.1 to 30 μg/mL. 
The blood distribution of apalutamide was similar as M3 for all species, with the majority of the compounds 
bound to plasma proteins (0.50 to 0.685), but also a considerable fraction distributed to blood cells (0.285 to 
0.424). 
Apalutamide is extensively metabolized in rats, dogs and humans. Apalutamide represented only 1% to 3% of 
the dose in urine, and 2% to 8% in feces. The metabolic pathways for apalutamide are comparable between rat, 
dog, and human. 
Metabolites were formed directly from apalutamide by several reaction types: oxidation, oxidative desulfuration, 
nitrile hydrolysis, cysteine-glycine condensation, cysteine condensation, amide hydrolysis, and 
ring-opening/hydrolysis.  
In human, JNJ-56142060 (M3) and JNJ-56142021 (M4) are considered major (41%) and minor (2.7%) human 
plasma metabolites. JNJ-56142060 (M3) (41%) is also found in rats (<10%) and dogs (51%), supporting the 
relevance of these species for the preclinical safety program of apalutamide. Adequate coverage of human 
exposure for M3 was established in the dog but not in the rat toxicology studies.  
In rat and human, M3 is derived directly from parent drug (N-demethylation), however in dog, M6 
(N-(hydroxymethyl)benzamide), an oxidation product of parent drug, was the precursor to M3. 
The formation of M3 (amide) is mediated predominantly by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, and the 
conversion of M3 to M4 (carboxylic acid) is most likely catalyzed by carboxylesterases. 
In humans the urinary pathway is the major route of excretion of apalutamide (64.2%). However, apalutamide 
is mainly eliminated in faeces in rats (58.2%) and excretion of apalutamide in dogs is divided equally between 
urine and feces.  
M4 accounted for the majority of excreted radioactivity in urine (rat, dog, and human), faeces (rat and dog), and 
rat bile, thus N-demethylation of the N-methylbenzamide moiety to an amide (M3), followed by amide 
hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid (M4) and direct amide hydrolysis of the N-methylbenzamide moiety to M4 are the 
principal metabolic clearance pathways of parent drug. The formation of M20 (amide) by N-demethylation of 
M19 (ring opening/hydrolysis product of apalutamide) is an important metabolic clearance pathway in dogs and 
humans. M20 is more abundant in urine than all other excreted metabolites (except M4). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 25/139 
  
  
The similarities in the in vitro and in vivo metabolic profile between rats, dogs and men support the adequacy of 
these species for toxicological assessment of apalutamide. 
In vitro studies showed that apalutamide and M3 are moderate to strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers (SmPC 
section 4.5). 
Apalutamide and M3 are moderate inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, and weak inhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
and CYP3A4. In humans, apalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, a weak inducer of CYP2C9 
and it did not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to the CYP2C8 substrate. 
Apalutamide and M3 were substrates for P-gp/multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1), but not for BCRP, OATP1B1, and 
OATP1B3. Both compounds are inhibitors of P-gp/MDR1 and BCRP, OCT2, OAT3 and MATE-1 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. Interactions with other transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and MATE-2K) are not 
clinically relevant. Apalutamide and M3 did not inhibit OAT1. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The MTD of apalutamide following a single oral dose administration in male animals exceeded the highest single 
dose tested, i.e. > 2,000 mg/kg in male rats and > 40 mg/kg in male dogs. The MTD of apalutamide following 
single oral dose administration was 100 mg/kg in male and female mice. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of apalutamide after repeated oral administration was studied in pivotal toxicology studies with 
dosing up to 26 weeks in male rats and 39 weeks in male dogs.

The selection of species and duration of the studies are appropriate for the proposed indication. Recovery 
periods were included in the 13-weeks male rat study (30 days), 13-weeks male dog study (2 months) and 26 
weeks female rats study (2 months) and are recommended, but missing, in pivotal toxicity studies, namely the 
26 weeks in male rats and 39 weeks in dogs. The adequacy of including recovery periods in pivotal toxicity 
studies is supported by the detection of effects such as bile duct/oval cell hyperplasia in dogs in the longer 
studies and because non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer may include earlier stage prostate 
cancer and patient populations outside the scope of the ICH S9. However, considering apalutamide-related 
findings were reported to partially or fully recover in 13-weeks male rat and dog studies and the 3Rs 
(Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) principle, additional studies to assess the reversibility of finding in 
longer toxicity studies are not required. In addition, the Applicant should perform long term carcinogenicity 
studies, which may be useful to assess the clinical relevance of hyperplasias observed in dogs (see RMP). 
In repeat-dose studies, test article-related mortality was observed after repeated dosing at ≥ 250 mg/kg/day in 
rats, at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day in male dogs and at 20 mg/kg/day in female dogs. At MTD levels after repeated dosing 
in rats and dogs, at which no test article-related mortality was observed, animal-to-human exposure ratios 
based on AUC were 5.7 and 3.0, respectively. 
Lower body weight gain and food consumption were reported for male rats and dogs at most dose levels and for 
female dogs above the MTD. A higher body weight gain was observed in female rats. Weight decrease and 
decreased apatite were also observed in humans after treatment with apalutamide. 
Apalutamide affected the male reproductive system (atrophy of secondary sex glands; degeneration of 
seminiferous tubules and hyperplasia/hypertrophy of interstitial (Leydig) cells), mammary glands (alteration of 
the male mammary gland to a female tubuloalveolar morphology), pituitary gland (increases in the weights and 
hypertrophy in the pars distalis), adrenal glands (increments in the weights and cortical hypertrophy), and 
thymus (increases in the weights), at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day in rats and/or at ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day in dogs. Plasma 
exposure levels of apalutamide at these doses were slightly below (male dog) or around (male rat) the 
apalutamide exposure in individuals with CRPC. These changes were partially to fully reversible. In the 26-week 
repeat-dose toxicology study in male rats, changes in the rat testis progressed to benign interstitial (Leydig) cell 
adenomas.  
Serum cholesterol was dose-relatedly increased in rat studies (up to 3-fold) and to a lesser extent in dogs (up 
to 1.7-fold). Increases in cholesterol have been reported for other anti-androgenic drugs as enzalutamide. 
Increased white blood cells, especially lymphocytes and a decrease in red cell mass were consistently observed 
in rat studies. Fibrinogen was increased in rats in longer studies (≥3 months) at ≥25 mg/kg. Increases in serum 
total protein, albumin, globulin, urea nitrogen, creatinine, triglycerides, HDL, LDL and glucose were observed in 
rat studies at ≥25 mg/kg. Other changes in hematology (e.g. increase or decrease in APTT and PT in male or 
female rats, respectively) and serum parameters (e.g. increases in GGT, calcium, phosphate and ALT) were not 
observed consistently throughout the studies and mostly observed at high doses (150 mg/kg) in shorter-term 
repeat-dose studies (≤28 days).  
Another target organ of toxicity after prolonged treatment with apalutamide is the liver, as evidenced by 
dose-dependent increased liver weights and/or reversible hepatocellular hypertrophy in rats and bile duct/oval 
cell hyperplasia in the male dog observed after 39 weeks of dosing. Recovery of the bile duct/oval cell 
hyperplasia in the male dog was not assessed. Increases inALP in rats and dogs were shown to be fully 
reversible. Increases in ALP and ALT have also been associated with other anti-androgenic drugs. 
Rat thyroid alterations (organ weight increase, follicular hypertrophy or follicular hyperplasia or both) were 
observed in the 28-day study in males and the 26-week study in females.

Page 32/139 
  
  
Other findings observed in some of the repeat-dose studies in rat and dog (decreases in salivary gland weights 
in 28-day male rat study; increased heart and kidney weights in 26-week female rat study; and decreased 
kidney weights in 39-week male dog study) were often not confirmed in longer-term toxicology studies at similar 
doses levels and/or not accompanied by histopathological changes.  
The toxicity profile of apalutamide was generally consistent across studies with more target organs in rats 
relative to dogs. 
Genotoxicity 
Apalutamide and its major metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) were tested in three standard assays for 
genotoxicity: an in vitro Ames test, an in vitro chromosome aberration test in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats. The results of all these studies were negative. 
Apalutamide and metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation 
(Ames) assay and were not genotoxic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test or the in vivo rat 
micronucleus assay. Apalutamide was not genotoxic in the in vivo rat Comet assay. The inactive metabolite 
JNJ-56142021 (M4) did not induce mutations in the Ames assay and was weakly positive in the in vitro 
chromosome aberration test. Since apalutamide tested negative in two in vivo studies (rat micronucleus assay 
and rat Comet assay) with adequate exposure to JNJ-56142021 (M4) in plasma and liver, JNJ-56142021 (M4) is 
considered non-genotoxic in vivo. 
Carcinogenicity 
According to the ICH S9 guideline, carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for 
therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. It is noted that in the SAWP/CHMP scientific 
advice (EMEA/H/SA/2344/1/2012/SME/III) carcinogenicity studies as well as repeat-dose toxicity studies longer 
than 3 months were not required, but pending the results of the Phase III studies. The company has conducted 
6 and 9 month toxicity studies in rats and dogs, respectively, but no carcinogenicity studies. Clinical studies 
seem to indicate that the product might provide a clinical benefit on NM-CRPC patients with high risk of 
developing metastasis and the ICH S1A states that in cases where the therapeutic agent is successful and life is 
significantly prolonged, there may be later concerns regarding secondary cancers. In addition, considering the 
observed hypertrophic effects caused by apalutamide in the repeat-dose toxicity studies, even though the 
compound is not genotoxic, carcinogenic studies should be conducted. The Applicant has planned a nonclinical 
carcinogenicity program with apalutamide. The final report of a 2-year carcinogenicity study in the rat will be 
available by the third quarter of 2021 and the final report of a 6-month carcinogenicity study in the transgenic 
Tg.rasH2 mouse will be available by the third quarter of 2020 (see RMP). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Considering the indication and patient population, prostate cancer in males, a full reproduction toxicity 
programme is not warranted. Only a male fertility study in rats was performed. This showed a decrease in 
epididymal sperm concentration and motility and in copulation rates along with reduced weights of the 
secondary sex glands and epididymis at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day (0.85 fold the human exposure based on AUC), and a 
lower fertility rate and a reduced potential for generating viable offspring at 150 mg/kg/day (5.7 times the 
human exposure based on AUC). Therefore, based on animal studies, effects on male fertility cannot be 
discarded. Effects on fertility in male rats were reversible after 8 weeks from the last apalutamide 
administration.

Toxicokinetic data 
Animal-to-human exposure ratios (Cmax and AUC) for apalutamide and metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) were 
calculated based on animal exposures at the NOAEL and MTD in the 26-week male rat and 39-week male dog 
toxicology study relative to human reference exposures from a Phase 1b QT/QTc study. 
Table 3. Apalutamide and JNJ-56142060 (M3) exposure in male animals (26-week rat and 39-week 
dog) at the NOAEL and MTD relevant to humans 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were submitted. 
Other toxicity studies 
Apalutamide and M3 did not demonstrate phototoxicity in the in vitro Neutral Red uptake assay. 
According to the drug product and drug substance specifications, impurities JNJ-56142047 and JNJ-64464920 
should be qualified. JNJ-56142047 is considered toxicologically qualified because it is the M2 metabolite of 
apalutamide and JNJ-64464920 is toxicologically qualified on a repeat-dose toxicology study in rats at a 
concentration ~4 fold the highest concentration administered to human. The genotoxic potential of 
JNJ-64464920 was assessed by two (Q)SAR methodologies, DEREK and Leadscope, and no structure alerts were 
detected. Thus, JNJ-64464920 is considered no genotoxic and no further testing is required. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A complete environmental risk assessment has been performed for apalutamide and no adverse environmental 
effects are anticipated as a consequence of the use of apalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer as 
indicated in the SmPC. 
It is noted the PECsw refinement of the applicant is considered not acceptable. The active ingredient is excreted 
by approximately 88% (De Vries, 2015) and cannot be distributed evenly over 70 days. A PECsw refinement in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 34/139 
 
  
  
phase II tier B is possible taking into account the distribution in the sewage treatment plant with the simple treat 
model and the complete excretion of the active ingredient. This would result in a PECsw refined of 0.985 µg/L, 
in contrast to 0.014 µg/L by the applicant. The PECsw refined value based on simple treat model does not alter 
the conclusions of apalutamide ERA. 
A precautionary statement of the potential environmental risks and clear instructions aimed at minimising the 
quantity discharged into the environment and appropriate mitigation measures is included in the SmPC and PIL.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Apalutamide is an orally administered AR inhibitor that is a potent and selective antagonist of the AR without 
significant agonist properties. Apalutamide antagonizes AR signalling through inhibition of AR nuclear 
translocation and DNA binding to androgen response elements. Gene transcription of the androgen-responsive 
genes, PSA and TMPRSS2, is inhibited by apalutamide, resulting in concentration-dependent reduction of these 
protein levels in vitro. Apalutamide reduces proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells and 
increases apoptosis and necrosis in castrated mice bearing LNCaP/AR(cs) xenografts tumors.  
Information on the affinity of apalutamide to AR in the species employed for the assessment of the product 
would be welcomed post-authorization.  
The prominent human plasma metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) was also shown to bind directly to the AR, but was 
3-fold less potent than apalutamide. Other minor metabolites including M1, JNJ- 56142047 (M2), and 
JNJ-56142021 (M4) were considered inactive with respect to on-target AR effects. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed in vitro to assess the potential of apalutamide to inhibit 
receptors and transporters. Apalutamide and metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have been shown to be inhibitors 
of the GABAA-gated chloride channel at clinically relevant concentrations. This interaction may be the 
mechanism for the convulsions observed in general toxicology studies in dogs and mice. Seizures have been also 
observed in patients treated with apalutamide and enzalutamide and the effect is described in the SmPC. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 36/139 
 
 
  
  
Next to seizures, other CNS-related clinical signs were noted after repeated doses in dogs (e.g. tremors, wobbly 
gait, ataxia) at non-tolerated doses. However, no test article-related CNS effects were observed in a FOB 
assessment or in the 26-week toxicity study in females rats. The M3 exposure in animals (rats and dogs) at the 
NOAEL for CNS effects compared to the clinical exposure is considered low to discard the risk of developing CNS 
effects in patients. In the Phase 3 clinical Study ARN-509-003, the incidence of tremor, gait disturbance, and 
ataxia was low and similar between the treatment arms. 
Noteworthy, the inhibition of the 5-HT2B receptor-ligand interactions was 25% and activation of 5-HT2B 
receptor agonists has been associated with the valvular heart disease. Based on the totality of nonclinical in vitro 
and in vivo data and supported by clinical observations, the risk for valvular heart disease risk due to 5-HT2B 
binding activity of apalutamide and its metabolite is considered low. 
For cardiac safety pharmacology, apalutamide and M3 inhibited the hERG current at concentration higher than 
the anticipated highest free concentration in humans and they did not prolong action potential repolarization in 
isolated canine Purkinje fibbers at concentrations around 50 times higher than the anticipated unbound Cmax 
plasma exposure of apalutamide and metabolite M3 in men with CRPC treated with apalutamide at 240 mg/day. 
Apalutamide at 3 and 10 µM, but not at 30 μM, induced a statistically significant reduction in APA at a 2s BCL 
(Mean; 0.5 and -1.7 mV, respectively) and the shape (slope) of the apalutamide curve differs quite remarkably 
from those of vehicle control and metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3). These changes are not supported by the other 
parameters that characterize the action potential and therefore are considered biologically insignificant. The 
changes of the slope of the apalutamide curve are clarified by the biological variability of the cell content within 
Purkinje fibre.  
Single oral administration of apalutamide in conscious telemetered dogs was correlated to prolonged QT 
interval. This finding is considered coincidental due to the inter-individual variation within the group and 
individual pre-dose variations and thus, no clinically relevant.  
In safety pharmacology studies apalutamide had no relevant effects on respiratory systems at clinically relevant 
exposures at 240 mg. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed.  
The oral formulation used in most of the PK/TK evaluations of apalutamide is a lipid emulsion which is the same 
formulation as the apalutamide drug product used in the in vivo pharmacodynamic studies and in the early 
clinical studies. However, a more stable formulation of higher dosage strength and comparable bioavailability 
was developed. Pharmacokinetic profiles of both formulation have not been directly compared in non-clinical 
species, but in the dog formulation study, a formulation prototype of the currently marketed tablet had an 
relative bioavailability (Frel) of 117% compared to the soft gel capsule. Since most toxicities found in animals 
were observed at doses that provide low safety margins to disregard the effects in patients, minimal increment 
in bioavailability of the drug with the new formulation does not alter the relevance of the safety data provided. 
Moreover, the tablet and capsule formulations were demonstrated to be bioequivalent in a human relative 
bioavailability study. 
Pharmacokinetic data support the adequacy of rats and dogs for toxicological assessment of apalutamide, 
despite adequate coverage of human exposure for M3 was established in the dog but not in the rat toxicology 
studies.  
Regarding mechanisms for drug-drug pharmacokinetic interactions, apalutamide is a substrate of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP2C8 and metabolite N-desmethyl apalutamide is formed by these enzymes. Apalutamide 
and its N-desmethyl metabolite are moderate to strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers, are moderate inhibitors 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 37/139 
  
  
of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, and weak inhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. In humans, Apalutamide  is a 
strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, a weak inducer of CYP2C9 and it did not cause clinically meaningful 
changes in exposure to the CYP2C8 substrate. Apalutamide and its main metabolite M3 do not affect CYP1A2 and 
CYP2D6 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. 
Apalutamide and M3 were substrates for P-gp/multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1), but not for BCRP, OATP1B1, and 
OATP1B3. Both compounds are inhibitors of P-gp/MDR1 and BCRP, OCT2, OAT3 and MATE-1 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. Interactions with other transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and MATE-2K) are not 
clinically relevant. Apalutamide and M3 did not inhibit OAT1. 
The general toxicology studies were conducted in rats up to 26 weeks and dogs up 39 weeks. The selection of 
species and duration of the studies are appropriate for the proposed indication. Recovery periods were included 
in the 13-weeks male rat study (30 days), 13-weeks male dog study (2 months) and 26 weeks female rats study 
(2 months) and are recommended, but missing, in pivotal toxicity studies, namely the 26 weeks in male rats and 
39 weeks in dogs. The adequacy of including recovery periods in pivotal toxicity studies is supported by the 
detection of effects such as bile duct/oval cell hyperplasia in dogs only in the longer studies and because 
non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer may include earlier stage prostate cancer and patient 
populations outside the scope of the ICH S9. However, considering apalutamide-related findings were reported 
to partially or fully recover in 13-weeks male rat and dog studies and the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and 
Refinement) principle, additional studies to assess the reversibility of finding in longer toxicity studies are not 
required. In addition, the Applicant should perform long term carcinogenicity studies, which may be useful to 
assess the clinical relevance of hyperplasias found in dogs. 
Most toxicities affected the reproductive system, mammary glands, pituitary gland, adrenal glands, thymus, 
white blood cells, red cell mass, platelets, and serum cholesterol. All findings were at least partly reversible 
within 30 or 60 days. Plasma exposure levels of apalutamide at which these findings were observed were slightly 
below (male dog) or around (male rat) the apalutamide exposure in individuals with CRPC. 
Additionally, hepatocellular and thyroid hypertrophy were observed in rats, and bile duct/oval cell hyperplasia 
was observed in the 39-week male dog study with concomitant increases in serum ALP. ALP increases (also in 
rats) were shown to be fully reversible, but recovery of the bile duct/oval cell hyperplasia was not assessed.  
The in vitro and in vivo test were negative and apalutamide was considered no genotoxic.   
According to the ICH S9 guideline, carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for 
therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. However, However, clinical studies seem to 
indicate that the product might increase significantly the overall survival on NM-CRPC patients with high risk of 
developing metastasis and the ICH S1A states that in cases where the therapeutic agent is successful and life is 
significantly prolonged, there may be later concerns regarding secondary cancers. In addition, considering the 
observed hypertrophic effects caused by apalutamide in the repeat-dose toxicity studies, even though the 
compound is not genotoxic, carcinogenic studies should be conducted. The Applicant has planned a nonclinical 
carcinogenicity program with apalutamide. The final report of a 2-year carcinogenicity study in the rat will be 
available by the third quarter of 2021 and the final report of a 6-month carcinogenicity study in the transgenic 
Tg.rasH2 mouse will be available by the third quarter of 2020. The Applicant is requested for a letter of 
commitment to carry out carcinogenicity studies on the proposed date. 
Reprotoxicity studies indicate apalutamide may impair fertility in males. 
No evidences of phototoxicity has been found.

Regarding the non-clinical part of the RMP, taking into account the current version of the guideline on good 
pharmacovigilance practices, it is expected that drug-drug interactions could be manageable in the clinic without 
negatively impacting the overall benefit-risk of apalutamide. Consequently, only “seizures” is a safety concern 
relevant to humans. 
Based on the environmental risk assessment, no adverse environmental effects are anticipated as a 
consequence of the use of apalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer as indicated in the SmPC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The single dose clinical pharmacology program was performed in healthy male volunteers, whereas the multiple 
dose studies were done in prostate cancer patients.  
At steady state, mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC values for apalutamide were 6 µg/mL (28%) and 100 µg.h/mL 
(32%), respectively.  
One of the two main plasma metabolites, N-desmethyl apalutamide (JNJ-56142060), has approximately 
one-third the potency of apalutamide (the parent compound) and has a higher plasma AUC (AUC 
metabolite/parent drug ratio for N-desmethyl apalutamide following repeat-dose administration was about 1.3 
(21%)) and lower protein binding than apalutamide itself (96% versus 95%), and is thus expected to contribute 
substantially to drug effect (about 28% to 32% of the clinical activity of apalutamide). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 41/139 
 
 
  
  
Absorption 
Oral absorption of apalutamide is fast with Cmax 3-5 hours post dose for tablets. Absorption of apalutamide is 
high based oral bioavailability study 006 (after dose normalization to 240 mg, Fabs=1.1 and ranged from 1.08 
to 1.13 between subjects).  
The in vitro permeability of MDV3100 is high (Papp A-to-B of 42.3×10-6 cm/s), and in the mass balance study, 
64.6% of the dose was recovered in urine and 22.8% of the dose as metabolites in faeces, indicating a high 
extent of absorption. Together with low aqueous solubility (0.001 g/100 mL or 2.5 mg/250 mL), apalutamide 
can be considered a BCS class II substance. 
Drug transporter studies indicated that apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide are substrates of P-gp but 
not substrates of BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. 
BIOEQUIVALENCE 
Two different formulations (softgel capsules and tablets) have been used over the course of clinical development 
of apalutamide. Apalutamide is supplied as film coated tablet. Early clinical pharmacology and clinical studies 
used liquid-filled soft gelatin capsules containing a non-aqueous lipid-based solution of apalutamide. 
The final selected tablet formulation had comparable bioavailability relative to the capsule formulation based on 
AUC∞ but resulted in slightly lower Cmax after single dose administration (N=15), with GMR (90% CI) of 
107.20% (94.46-121.67%) and 90.10% (79.15-102.56%), respectively (Study 1011). 
Table 5. Effect of Treatment on the Comparative Bioavailability of Apalutamide Under Fasted 
Conditions (Study 1011) 
Following repeat dose administrations in subjects with mCRPC (n=4), the tablet versus capsule GMRs were 
92.05% for Cmax (90% CI: 66.66-127.12%) and 94.30% for AUC0-24 (90% CI: 82.19-108.20%) (Substudy 
1010). The GMR for Cmax was consistent with that derived from the bioequivalence simulation analysis.  
The formulations are not strictly bioequivalent according to the criteria outlined in the Bioequivalence guideline. 
As mentioned in the scientific advice, these criteria have, however, been set with generic applications in mind, 
where the generic product is approved solely on bioequivalence data and therefore must be shown to be 
essentially similar to the originator. For a change of formulation during the development of an originator 
product, other considerations may be taken into account. The pivotal study was conducted with both 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 42/139 
 
  
  
formulations and an assessment about the effect on efficacy and safety has been conducted. Highlighting that 
apparently less diarrhea and nauseas events have been observed with tablets Differences on Cmax of 
approximately 10% are initially acceptable. This differences could have certain impact on studies where food 
effect or DDI effects are being studies. A specific substudy on food effect was conducted with tablets in study 
1011, which is reassuring. Although certain impact on DDI studies cannot be fully ruled out, the impact is not 
expected to be meaningful  
Note: The following studies were conducted using a 30-mg softgel capsule: the absolute bioavailability/mass 
balance study (Study 006) and the drug-drug interaction study on effect of strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 on 
apalutamide (Study 1012). All ongoing subjects receiving capsules in Studies 001 (the first-in-man Phase 1/2 
study), 1008 (the PK study in Japanese subjects with mCRPC), Study 1010 (DDI study on effect of apalutamide 
on abiraterone and prednisone), and the Phase 3 SPARTAN (Study 003) were switched to tablets. Studies 1018 
(Hepatic impairment), 1019 (QT prolongation), 1020 (DDI study on Effect of apalutamide on other drug), and 
1021 (Japanese) were conducted using the tablet formulation only.  
To support the manufacturing and control strategies of the proposed commercial tablet formulation, 2 additional 
relative bioavailability studies were conducted. The effect of CQAs of the intermediate on the bioavailability of 
the tablet formulation was investigated in Study 1015. The bioavailability of the tablet formulation produced 
from 2 different manufacturing sites was assessed in Study 1017. Results of those studies showed that 
formulations were bioequivalent according to the criteria outlined in the Bioequivalence guideline. 
Food-effect 
Two substudies to investigate food effect were conducted; one with capsules (substudy 1001) and other with 
tablets (substudy 1011). As only tablets formulation will be commercialized, main attention is paid to substudy 
1011. 
Food effect substudy in study 1011 has a parallel-group design with apparently similar demographic and 
baseline characteristics between arms. Considering the long half-life of apalutamide the parallel-group design is 
acceptable. This food effect study conducted in healthy subjects under fasting conditions and with a high-fat 
meal indicated that Cmax was decreased by 16% (83.95; 90% CI: 74.90, 94.11) while AUC remained 
unchanged (94.08; 90% CI: 83.75, 105.70). Median tmax was delayed about 2 hours with food (from 3 hours 
to 5 hours). The decrease in Cmax was not considered clinically relevant. Additionally, apalutamide was 
administered without regard to food in pivotal study.

 Distribution 
Mean V/F in the single dose study in healthy male subjects ranged between 250 and 296 L. Based on the 
population PK analysis the Vss was estimated to be 276 L in subjects with CRPC after oral multiple dose 
administration. Overall, the volume of distribution of apalutamide was greater than the volume of total body 
water, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution.  
In vitro data show high protein binding of both apalutamide (96%) and major plasma metabolite (N-desmethyl 
metabolite 95%). Main bound is to serum albumin with no concentration dependency. This needs to be 
considered when discussing the effects of drug-drug interactions or impaired organ function on active moiety 
(apalutamide+ N-desmethyl metabolite).  
The mean blood-to-plasma ratios of total 14C-radioactivity ranged from 0.91 to 0.98, indicating equal 
distribution of total 14C-radioactivity between plasma and red blood cells (Study 006).

In the mass-balance study after a single dose of apalutamide, in parallel to parent drug (45% of total 
radioactivity AUC) two major plasma metabolites were identified, N-desmethyl metabolite (44% of total AUC) 
and inactive carboxylic acid metabolite (3% of total AUC). As apalutamide and the two metabolites together 
constituted more than 90% of total radioactivity AUC, and no unidentified metabolites were found, it seems 
unlikely that there would be other quantitatively or pharmacologically/toxicologically important plasma 
metabolites.  
In vitro studies indicate that apalutamide is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4 
to form N-desmethyl apalutamide. N-desmethyl apalutamide is further metabolized to the inactive carboxylic 
acid metabolite, JNJ-56142021, by carboxylesterase. The importance of CYP2C8, and to a lower extent CYP3A4, 
was verified in vivo in interaction studies with the CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (68% increase in apalutamide 
AUC, 15.2% decrease in N-desmethyl apalutamide and 102% increase in inactive carboxylic acid metabolite 
AUC) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazol (1% increase in apalutamide AUC, 12% increase in N-desmethyl 
apalutamide and 44% increase in inactive carboxylic acid metabolite AUC). Based on a PBPK model the 
contribution of CYP2C8 seems to decrease over time from 58% at single-dose to 40% at steady state whereas 
the contribution of CYP3A4 seems to increase from 13% at single-dose to 37% at steady state. However, this 
PBPK model can only be considered as an exploratory model. Thus, firm conclusion from it should not be reached 
and results should be interpreted with caution. In general, the metabolism of apalutamide and its active 
metabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, is sufficiently characterized.

The potential impact of CYP2C8 polymorphism on apalutamide pharmacokinetic have been discussed by the 
applicant. Genetic polymorphism is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on PK of apalutamide 
and N-desmethyl apalutamide. However, particular attention was suggested to interaction with CYP3A4 
inhibitors in CYP2C8 poor metabolisers. However, after this issue was properly disused by the applicant, it was 
accepted that the interaction of apalutamide with CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2C8 poor metabolisers is expected to 
be similar as in other genotypes. 
Elimination 
Apalutamide is mainly hepatically eliminated, and renal excretion of unchanged drug is low (1.2% of dose). 
Apalutamide showed an oral clearance of 1.31 L/h after single dosing, increasing to 2.04 L/h at steady state as 
results of auto-induction. Mean terminal half-life in patients at steady state is 3 days. With daily administration, 
apalutamide accumulates approximately 5-fold.  
The metabolites of apalutamide are excreted mainly in urine, and the most abundant metabolites in urine are M4 
(31% of dose) followed by M20 (approximately 7% of dose). No relevant biliary excretion seems to occur. The 
recovery in the mass balance study (89%) was somewhat low, but acceptable in view of the long half-life and the 
long sampling period in the study (up to 70 days post-dose), and more than 80% of the recovered radioactivity 
was identified. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following single and repeat once daily dosing, apalutamide exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased in a 
dose-proportional manner across the dose range of 30 to 480 mg. Following multiple dose administration of 
240-, 300-, 390-, and 480-mg apalutamide, N-desmethyl apalutamide Cmax and AUC also increased with 
increasing dose. Statistical analysis of dose proportionality of N-desmethyl apalutamide PK was not performed 
due to the limited amount of data. 
An increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) was observed with repeat dosing, likely due to induction of 
apalutamide’s own metabolism. Apalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4. With a once daily dosing regimen, 
apalutamide steady state was achieved after 4 weeks (Study 001) and the mean accumulation ratio was 
approximately 5-fold based AUC (Study 1019). The metabolism of N-desmethyl apalutamide was not 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 46/139 
 
  
  
time-dependent. The mean EHL for apalutamide in subjects with CRPC was about 78.7 hours (approximately 3 
days) at steady-state, indicating that accumulation was less than expected based on the mean t1/2 of 183 hours 
after single-dose. The Applicant was asked to discuss the implications of accumulation after multiple dosing on 
possible higher incidence of adverse events that could arise with this enhanced exposure. After applicant’s 
deeply discussion, this issue was considered resolved since most subjects were already at steady state 
concentration levels when they suffer from the TEAE and the higher frequency of TEAEs with continued dosing 
was not observed. 
Intra-and inter-individual variability 
PK of apalutamide is characterized by low to moderate intrasubject and intersubject variability (<30%). In the 
population PK analysis, the intersubject variability for N-desmethyl apalutamide was estimated to be low 
(19.7%, 19.7%, and 19.6% for AUC0-24,ss, Cmin, and Cmax, respectively). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
All clinical studies were conducted in adult male subjects only. Single-dose studies were conducted in healthy 
male subjects because the effect of androgen blockade after single-dose administration was limited in duration. 
However, multiple-dose studies only enrolled subjects with prostate cancer as prolonged androgen suppression 
in healthy subjects was not recommended. Using single and repeat dose data, the population PK analysis 
identified that healthy subjects had a 27% higher relative bioavailability compared to subjects with CRPC, 
resulting in proportionally higher AUC0-24,ss of apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide. It should be noted 
that when health status is evaluated as a covariate GMR resulted in 1.42 (90%CI: 1.36, 1.49) for apalutamide 
and 1.29 (90% CI: 1.25, 1.33) for N-desmethyl apalutamide. The potential impact of this differences observed 
on PK between healthy subjects and cancer patients on extrapolation the results of studies conducted on healthy 
patients to cancer patients, specially study on hepatic impairment and on DDI with strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 
inhibitors was requested to be discussed. It was accepted that in the PK analysis other confounded factors could 
have impact on results, while data obtained at single dose under controlled conditions seems to be in line 
between healthy subjects and patients. Thus, this issue was considered resolved. 
Data from the following 7 clinical studies were pooled for the population PK analysis: 001, 1008 (Japanese), 
1011 (bioequivalence among different formulations), 1018 (hepatic impairment), 1019 (QT prolongation), 1021 
(Japanese), and 003 [SPARTAN] (pivotal).

discernible impact on the pharmacokinetic parameters of apalutamide and JNJ-56142060. Consequently, 
apalutamide dose adjustment based on these covariates is not warranted. 
Figure 4.Forest plot for the covariate evaluation for Apalutamide (upper panel) and JNJ-56142060 
(lower panel), using Dataset C. 
In the final model all parameters were estimated with acceptable precision with a RSE <35.2% for the fixed 
effects and RSE<30% for the random effects. The residual error was 22.6% for apalutamide and 14.9% for 
JNJ-56142060. The goodness-of-fit plots of the final model for apalutamide and JNJ-56142060 against the 
population model prediction and individual model prediction seems to show a normal random scatter around the 
identity line. However, a slight over prediction trend seems to be observed with low concentrations, especially 
CHMP assessment report

for apalutamide. The distribution of conditional weighted residuals and normalized prediction distribution errors 
(NPDE), as a function of the population predictions and time, supported adequacy of the model, although the 
same slight trend to over prediction with low concentrations is observed in those plots. The prediction corrected 
VPC shows that the final model described well the time course of both apalutamide and JNJ-56142060 plasma 
concentrations following single and multiple dose administrations, although the variability predicted during the 
first weeks since the first dose at single dose is higher than the observed one. The general trend in the data can 
be considered well captured by the population PK model. 
Special populations 
No clinically relevant effects of renal function [patients with mild (n=453) and moderate (n=132) renal 
impairment or renal normal function (n=372)], hepatic function [patients with mild hepatic impairment (n=118) 
or hepatic normal function (n=974)] , race [White (n=761), Black (n=71), Asian non-Japanese (n=58), 
Japanese (n=58), other (n=11)] or age (range: 18-94 years), TB, AST, ALT, ALP, TP, eGFR, CYP3A4-inducing 
and CYP2C8-inhibiting co-medication on apalutamide or N-desmethyl apalutamide clearances were observed in 
the population PK model.  
The following covariates, health status, weight and serum albumin concentration, were statistically associated 
with apalutamide or JNJ-56142060 exposure. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the effect of body weight and 
serum albumin concentration on the apalutamide or JNJ-56142060 pharmacokinetic parameters is low (<25%). 
Health status has been discussed above (PK in target population). 
A single dose clinical study was performed in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, showing no 
clinically relevant effects of hepatic function on apalutamide pharmacokinetics [AUC∞ GMRs; 90% CI for 
apalutamide of mild vs normal: 94.59% (76.06, 117.64) and moderate vs normal 113.35% (81.70, 157.26), 
AUC∞ GMRs; 90% CI for N-desmethyl apalutamide of mild vs normal: 96.28% (83.79, 110.62) and moderate 
vs normal 81.15% (65.00, 101.32)]. No dose adjustments are proposed in the SmPC for these groups. In the 
mild hepatic impairment group, 7 subjects out of 8 have normal levels of serum albumin, serum bilirubin and 
prothrombin time. In the moderate group, 4 out of 8 patients have normal levels of serum albumin, serum 
bilirubin and prothrombin time. Median Child-Plug Score in mild group is 5 and 7.5 in moderate group. It should 
be noted that even when differences on patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment in comparison with 
patients with normal hepatic function do not seem to be relevant at single dose, their relevance at steady state 
cannot be fully ruled out due to the time-dependent PK exhibit by apalutamide. Additionally, safety data on 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment are limited to a single dose study (only 2 patients with hepatic 
impairment were included in the pivotal study). For all the above, no dose adjustments recommendations are 
accepted for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment based on results at singe dose. However, a 
Phase I, single dose, clinical PK study in healthy non-cancer subjects with normal hepatic function and 
non-cancer subjects with severe hepatic impairment is required (see RMP). Meanwhile further information is not 
available on patients with severe impairment, apalutamide is not recommended in this population (see SmPC).

No data is available in patients with severe renal impairment. Administration with caution was recommended in 
this population in the SmPC, considering the low renal excretion of apalutamide and the fact that this 
recommendation is in line with enzalutamide. 
Elderly population is considered properly represented in those studies. Age of studied population is in line with 
age on patients with the study disease. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of other substances on apalutamide:  
Medicines that inhibit CYP2C8 
In a drug-drug interaction study, the Cmax of apalutamide decreased by 21% while AUC increased by 68% 
following co-administration of apalutamide 240 mg single dose with gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 inhibitor). As 
the active metabolite decreased (15.2% in AUC), the effect on active moiety (apalutamide+ N-desmethyl 
apalutamide) was substantially smaller (44.5% increase in AUC). Due to time-dependent pharmacokinetic of 
apalutamide, data on steady state are relevant. Simulations using a PBPK model suggest that gemfibrozil may 
increase the steady-state Cmax and AUC of apalutamide by 32% and 44%, respectively. For the active moieties 
(sum of unbound apalutamide plus the potency-adjusted unbound active metabolite), the steady-state Cmax and 
AUC may increase by 19% and 23%, respectively.

Current recommendations with strong, moderate and mild CYP2C8 inhibitor seem to be reasonable:  
“No initial dose adjustment is necessary when Erleada is co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., 
gemfibrozil, clopidogrel) however, consider reducing the Erleada dose based on tolerability (see section 4.2). 
Mild or moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8 are not expected to affect the exposure of apalutamide”. 
Medicines that inhibit CYP3A4 
In a drug-drug interaction study, the Cmax of apalutamide decreased by 22% while AUC was similar following 
co-administration of Erleada as a 240 mg single dose with itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). The effect on 
active moiety (apalutamide+ N-desmethyl apalutamide) was substantially smaller (4% increase in AUC). Due to 
time-dependent pharmacokinetic of apalutamide, data on steady state are relevant. Simulations using a PBPK 
model suggest that ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) may increase the steady-state Cmax and AUC of 
apalutamide by 38% and 51%, respectively. For the active moieties, the steady-state Cmax and AUC may 
increase by 23% and 28%, respectively.

Current recommendations with strong, moderate and mild CYP3A4 inhibitor seem to be reasonable: 
“No initial dose adjustment is necessary when Erleada is co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e.g., 
ketoconazole, ritonavir) however, consider reducing the Erleada dose based on tolerability (see section 4.2). 
Mild or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are not expected to affect the exposure of apalutamide”. 
Medicines that induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 
The effects of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide have not been evaluated in 
vivo. Simulations using a PBPK suggested that rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) may 
decrease the steady-state Cmax and AUC0-24 of apalutamide by 25% and 34%, respectively. For the active 
moieties, the steady-state Cmax and AUC0-24 may decrease by 15% and 19%, respectively. As mentioned 
above, data of PBPK model for steady-state are reassuring but this PBPK model has several limitations that 
preclude reaching firm conclusion from it (see above). The applicant justifies that a drug interaction study to 
evaluate the effects of rifampicin on steady-state PK of apalutamide was deemed infeasible due to safety and 
ethical concerns as it would require prolonged administration (>28 days) of rifampicin to cancer patients to 
reach new steady state of apalutamide given its long half-life. However, a similar DDI study was conducted for 
enzalutamide resulting in a 37% decrease of AUC. This results seems to be in line with simulation results. 
However, it should be noted that half-life of apalutamida is shorter than enzalutamide. The applicant provided a 
reasonable justification on the infeasibility of conducting an in vivo DDI study on effect of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 
inducers on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide.  
Other medicines 
As apalutamide is not ionizable under relevant physiological pH conditions, acid lowering agents are not 
expected to affect the solubility and bioavailability of apalutamide.  
In vitro, apalutamide and its N-desmethyl metabolite are substrates for P-gp. However, as apalutamide is 
completely absorbed after oral administration, P-gp is not expected to limit the absorption of apalutamide. 
Inhibition or induction of P-gp is not expected to change the PK of apalutamide in a clinically relevant manner. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018

Effects of apalutamide on other substances:  
In vitro studies showed that apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide are most active as CYP3A4 inducers, are 
moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8, and weak inhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. The induction of CYP3A4 suggested that apalutamide might induce other CYP isozymes and drug 
transporters (eg, CYP2C family and MDR1/P-gp) via activation of pregnane X receptor. In vitro data also 
indicated that apalutamide might be a clinically relevant inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Apalutamide and 
N-desmethyl apalutamide are shown to inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. However, the potential to affect 
substrates of these transporters is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
The significance of these in vitro findings was evaluated in a clinical “cocktail” drug-drug interaction study that 
included drug probes for CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2C8 
(pioglitazone), P-gp (fexofenadine), and BCRP/ OATP1B1 (rosuvastatin) (Study 1020).  
The results of this study suggest that apalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and a weak 
inducer of CYP2C9, P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1. A 92% decrease in the AUC of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), an 
85% decrease in the AUC of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), a 46% decrease in the AUC of S-warfarin 
(CYP2C9 substrate), a 30% decrease in the AUC of fexofenadine (P-gp substrate) and a 41% decrease in the 
AUC of rosuvastatin (BCRP/OATP1B1 substrate) was observed. Apalutamide did not cause clinically meaningful 
changes in exposure of piglitiazone (CYP2C8 substrate). 
Table 13. Results of cocktail study (1020) 
Induction of CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, P-gp and BCRP by apalutamide suggests that UDP-glucuronosyl 
transferase (UGT) may also be induced via activation of the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR), although it 
should be noted that induction of CYP2C9, P-gp, BCRP was weak. 
CHMP assessment report

An additional clinical study was conducted to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction between apalutamide 
and abiraterone-prednisone to determine the safety of the combination, and to evaluate in a descriptive manner 
the efficacy in subjects with mCRPC (Study 1010). The goal of this study was to provide dosing 
recommendations for abiraterone-prednisone in another Phase 3 study when combined with apalutamide (Study 
3001) and results are included herein to support drug interaction with prednisone and further support 
characterization of steady-state PK with capsules and tablets. In this study, the Cmax and AUC from time 0 to 
12 hours (AUC0-12) of prednisone decreased by 51% and 61%, respectively, and for prednisolone decreased by 
26% and 42%, respectively, following coadministration with apalutamide in combination with abiraterone 
acetate. Apalutamide did not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to abiraterone, the Cmax and AUC 
from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) of abiraterone decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In SPARTAN (Study 003), apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide exposures, measured as the AUC0-24, 
were 115 μg.h/mL (range: 19.8-291 μg.h/mL) and 152 μg.h/mL (range: 44.1-299 μg.h/mL), respectively. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Several plasma assays for apalutamide drug with and without a combination of metabolites were used to 
determine concentrations in samples from clinical studies.  
In general, the pre-study validations of the analytical methods are satisfactory. 
These analytical methods have been described below. 
Measurement of Parent Drug and Metabolites (N-desmethyl apalutamide and JNJ-56142021) in Plasma 
Five assays for unchanged apalutamide and metabolites were validated at various stages of the compound 
development. 
Analytical method xxxxxx36 
The above assay was adapted to include the measure metabolite N-desmethyl apalutamide. This adapted 
method consisted of the same sample preparation, chromatography, and mass spectrometry conditions. 
Besides the addition of the metabolite, another major difference was the increase of the upper limit of 
quantification for apalutamide from 20 to 25 μg/mL.  
These 2 methods were used within a single clinical study (Study 001). At the request of the sponsor, a cross 
validation of the method was conducted by analyzing a set of QC samples provided by another analytical lab at 
three unknown concentration levels (n=6). The provided QCs were analyzed against freshly prepared calibration 
standards and QCs. Cross validation QC comparison demonstrated acceptable results for externally prepared 
ARN-509 and ARN000308 QC samples. 
Analytical method xxxxxx27 
In 2013,, an assay was validated for the quantification of apalutamide, N-desmethyl apalutamide, and 
JNJ-56142021 (ARN000066 or M4). This method was only used in support of the human mass balance study, 
Study 006. 
Analytical method xxxxxx09 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 55/139 
  
  
A new assay was developed for the determination of apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide in human 
plasma in 2014. This method was optimized from the previous method xxxxxx27 (optimization of processing 
and chromatography, removal of JNJ-56142021 quantitation) for support of the majority of clinical studies, 
including the SPARTAN study. 
Analytical method 
In 2 single-dose studies that involved a 60-mg dose (Studies 1015 and 1017), the concentrations of 
apalutamide in the later portion of the concentration-time profiles were lower than the LLOQ (0.025 μg/mL) of 
method xxxxxx09. To improve characterization of the terminal half-life for those studies, the quantification limit 
of the assay was lowered to 0.005 μg/mL for both analytes. 
In the studies 1015 and 1017 in which the 2 methods (xxxxxx09 and xxxxxx59) were used, a cross-validation 
for apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide with study samples was performed to demonstrate that both 
methods have equal performance (see below). 
Study 1015 
A cross validation between xxxxx32 and xxxxxx11 was done on a selection of 29 samples for JNJ-56021927 and 
30 samples for JNJ-56142060, which already were analyzed applying xxxxxx32. 
The cross-validation for apalutamide complied with the acceptance criteria as 29 samples out of 29 samples 
(100.0%) and for N-desmethyl apalutamide as 28 samples out of 30 samples (93.3%) were within the 
acceptance criteria (±20%). 
Study 1017 
A cross validation between xxxxxx32 and xxxxxx11 was done on a selection of 30 samples for JNJ-56021927 
and 30 samples for JNJ-56142060, which already were analyzed applying xxxxxx32. 
The cross-validation for apalutamide complied with the acceptance criteria as 30 samples out of 30 samples 
(100.0%) and for N-desmethyl apalutamide as 29 samples out of 30 samples (96.7%) were within the 
acceptance criteria (±20%)  
Sponsor Reference No.: BA10849 
The objective of the study was to cross-validate the JNJ-56021927 and JNJ-56142060 assay in human EDTA 
plasma between laboratories  
Since the determination of apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide were performed at three different 
analytical sites a cross-validation between all the three analytical sites were performed using QC samples 
(CVQC). 
Cross-Validation 
CVQC samples were prepared  in human EDTA plasma at three levels (Low, Medium and High) and were divided 
in 18 separate polypropylene tubes, containing at least 1 mL of quality control sample each. After preparation, 
the CVQCs were organized into three sets, each consisting of 6 aliquots of CVQC low, 6 aliquots of CVQC medium 
and 6 aliquots of CVQC high. These samples were analyzed in house. After confirmation that the CVQC samples 
were analyzed successfully, aliquots were also sent to external laboratories 
The cross-validation samples were successfully analysed between three laboratories. 
Other analytical methods 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018

In the clinical studies, other analytical methods have been validated and used to determine the concentration of 
different analytes. 
These methods were used to determine the following analytes:  
4ß-hydroxycholesterol , Prednisone and Prednisolone , Itraconazole and 2-Hydroxyitraconazole, Gemfibrozil, 
Midazolam and 1-Hydroxymidazolam, S-Warfarin and 7-Hydroxy-S-Warfarin, Omeprazole, Omeprazole 
Sulfone, and 5-Hydroxyomeprazole, Abiraterone and abiraterone acetate ), Fexofenadine (Validation Report 
P1365) Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone, Rosuvastatin and N-Desmethylrosuvastatin. 
In general, the pre-study validations of the analytical methods are satisfactory.  
In-Study Validation 
In-study validation was conducted for the individual studies, and validation data are submitted and included in 
the respective bioanalytical study summaries. 
In general, the in-study validation shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs. The QCs used are 
representative of the calibration range for all analytes. 
For all analytes, the maximum storage period between collection and analysis was no longer that the current 
validated storage period at -70 ºC.  
In general, the analysis of study samples is acceptable and the re-analysis of the study samples was well 
justified and handled. Dilution samples were necessary in some samples (dilution integrity for different factor 
were validated). 
Incurred Samples Re-assay (ISR) was evaluated by additional analyses on a selection of samples plasma for 
apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide and the others analytes. The results demonstrated reproducibility as 
of the incurred sample repeats met the acceptance criteria (±20%). 
Chromatograms of calibrators, QCs, and subject samples (and corresponding sample sequences) from at least 
20% of the subject samples analyzed are included. 
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
Several models have been used to support this application: 
•  Bioequivalence Trial Simulation of Apalutamide Tablets versus Capsules Following Single and Repeat 
Dose Administrations 
The individual concentration-versus-time plots describe the individual subject data well. Shrinkage of residual 
error seems acceptable, although is high in several individual parameters for Dataset B and C. [Shrinkage of 
individual parameters was 2.8–10.8% for Dataset A, 0.27–49% for Dataset B, and 4.15–73.5% for Dataset C. 
Shrinkage of residual errors was 8.0–11.1% for all Datasets]. All structural model parameters were estimated 
with adequate precision based on relative standard error (RSE). Fluctuations in the lowess line near the region 
where intensive sampling occurred are observed in the CWRES vs. TIME and CWRES vs. PRED plots for Dataset 
C. According to the applicant, this phenomenon may be attributed to the disparities in sample size and sampling 
scheme between studies in Dataset C. The applicant provided standard Goodness of Fit for apalutamide PK from 
Dataset C by study to justified this fact. VPC plots show that the model seems to be suitable to describe the time 
course of apalutamide concentrations and its variability, although data for Dataset C seems to be quite limited. 
Overall, each of these plots, with some limitations for plots from Dataset C, shows good concordance between 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 57/139 
  
  
model prediction intervals and the data. VPC was not created for the concentration vs. time profiles from the 
ARN-509-001 study in Dataset C because of the small number of subjects (n=3).  
The applicant provided a reasonable justification for using different population PK model for the bioequivalence 
trials simulation between capsules and tables and for the population PK model submitted as final population PK 
model including data of pivotal study.   
•  Apalutamide mechanistic model of absorption in function of clinically relevant specifications and 
Physiology Based Dissolution Method in Two-Phase SGFsp-FaSSIF for 60-mg JNJ-56021927-AAA Oral 
Film-Coated Immediate Release Tablets 
Population Pharmacokinetics Model 
In the final model all parameters were estimated with acceptable precision with a RSE <35.2% for the fixed 
effects and RSE<30% for the random effects. The residual error was 22.6% for apalutamide and 14.9% for 
JNJ-56142060. Overall, the goodness-of-fit plots of the final model for apalutamide and JNJ-56142060 against 
the population model prediction and individual model prediction seems to show a normal random scatter around 
the identity line. However, a slight over prediction trend seems to be observed with low concentrations, 
especially for apalutamide. The distribution of conditional weighted residuals and normalized prediction 
distribution errors (NPDE), as a function of the population predictions and time, supported adequacy of the 
model, although the same slight trend to over prediction with low concentrations is observed in those plots. The 
prediction corrected VPC shows that the final model described well the time course of both apalutamide and 
JNJ-56142060 plasma concentrations following single and multiple dose administrations, although the 
variability predicted during the first weeks since the first dose at single dose is higher than the observed one. 
The general trend in the data can be considered well captured by the population PK model. 
In Dataset C, Run003, the shrinkage of IIV on CLt and F was 19% and 8%, respectively, while the shrinkage of 
IIV on the other parameters ranged from 42% to 74.4%. This suggest that graphical evaluation of the 
parameter vs potential covariate plots should be examined with great caution using Dataset C. Therefore, the 
applicant conducted the graphical evaluation of the covariate-parameter relationships with Dataset A. The 
covariate analysis was conducted using Dataset C. 
• 
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Simulations of JNJ-56021927 and 
inhibitors/inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in Human Subjects 
Apalutamide is mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Considered that apalutamide is a CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C8 inducer, and a CYP2C8 inhibitor, this might have impact on its metabolism. Therefore, over time the 
contribution of the different CYPs in the clearance of apalutamide might change.  
It should be noted that in the guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interaction, the PBPK models are not 
mentioned for induction. Qualification of PBPK model for inductions should be further investigated. Therefore, 
the results of this population PBPK model, where induction has been included, has be considered only as 
supporting data and information of this PBPK was not reflected in the SmPC . 
Additionally, the following limitation in relation with this PBPK model should be taken into account: 
-  Comparability between simulated and observed apalutamide and active metabolite (JNJ-56142060) oral 
PK parameters at 120 mg and 240 mg dose q.d. (capsules) is limited to observed data of 3 subject of 
study ARN-509-001. 
-  Simulation of PK profile after single oral administration of 240 mg apalutamide is conducted with 
capsules in healthy male subjects. It should be noted that differences of 10% in Cmax were observed

when capsules and tables formulations were compared. Healthy status was included in the final 
population PK as covariate with impact on PK. Therefore, these points could have certain impact on drug 
drug interaction results. 
Additionally, the following points were reasonably justified by the applicant: 
- 
The selection of study ARN-509-006 and 56021927PCR1012 for comparison of observed results versus 
simulation PK of apalutamide after single dose as well as the selection of ARN-509-001 and 
56021927PCR1020 for after multiple oral administration. 
-  Use of different elimination parameters for apalutamide and JNJ-56142060 in the PBPK with 
inhibitors/inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 and in the PBPK with OCT2, MATE and OAT3 transporter 
substrates. 
-  Several apalutamide parameters used for simulations were based on individual studies instead of 
parameters estimated by the Population PK. However, as prediction of the AUC and Cmax ratio after 
co-administration with some drug is acceptable, this issue is not further pursued. 
•  A physiology based pharmacokinetic approach to assess potential transporter mediated drug-drug 
interactions with JNJ-56021927 (apalutamide) as perpetrator in human subjects 
It should be noted that in the guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interaction, the PBPK models are not 
mentioned for inhibition of transport proteins. Qualification of PBPK model for inhibition of transport proteins 
should be further investigated. Therefore, the results of this population PBPK model should be considered only 
as supporting data and information of this PBPK was not reflected in the SmPC. 
Additionally, the following limitation in relation with this PBPK model should be taken into account: 
-  Comparability between simulated and observed apalutamide and active metabolite (JNJ-56142060) oral 
PK parameters at 240 mg dose q.d. (capsules) is limited to observed data of 3 subject of study 
ARN-509-001. 
-  Simulation of PK profile after single oral administration of 240 mg apalutamide is conducted with 
capsules in healthy male subjects. It should be noted that differences of 10% in Cmax were observed 
when capsules and tables formulations were compared. Healthy status was included in the final 
population PK as covariate with impact on PK. Therefore, these points could have certain impact on drug 
interaction results. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
N/A 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Apalutamide is an orally administered AR inhibitor that binds directly to the ligand –binding domain of the AR. 
Apalutamide prevents AR nuclear translocation, inhibits DNA binding, and impedes AR-mediated transcription, 
a mechanism that is distinct from the first generation anti-androgen, bicalutamide. Apalutamide (IC50=16 nM) 
binds AR with 7- to 10-fold greater affinity than bicalutamide (median IC50=160 nM) and competes for the same 
binding site in the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 59/139 
  
  
Four metabolites of apalutamide identified in preclinical species ( M1, JNJ-56142047 [M2], N-desmethyl 
apalutamide [JNJ-56142060 or M3], and JNJ-56142021 [M4]) were assessed for their on-target effects against 
the AR in a cell-based assay that monitors ligand induced DNA binding. 
N-desmethyl apalutamide was the most potent AR antagonist, but was still 3-fold less potent than apalutamide. 
Based on potency and relative clinical exposure, N-desmethyl apalutamide was considered to contribute to the 
clinical activity of apalutamide and was evaluated in the clinical studies. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Dose Selection 
The anti-tumor effect of apalutamide was demonstrated in murine tumor models of CRPC in which 
dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition was observed over the dose range of 1, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day for 
28 days. In mice, there was no difference in anti-tumor effect with increase in dose from 30 to 100 mg/kg, 
indicating that the maximum therapeutic response was achieved at 30 mg/kg/day. The mean apalutamide 
concentration at 24 hours postdose in mice at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day was 3.9 and 6.1 μg/mL, respectively. In 
SPARTAN (Study 003), the mean Cmin of apalutamide at the dose of 240 mg once daily in subjects with 
NM-CRPC was 4.24 μg/mL, which was within the range that produced maximum tumor regressions in the murine 
tumor models. 
The AR binding was assessed using FDHT-PET/CT imaging in 12 subjects with CRPC received doses of 
apalutamide ranging from 30 to 300 mg per day (Study 001 substudy). A decrease in FDHT uptake from baseline 
was observed as a function of steady-state apalutamide exposure with the relationship described using an 
inhibitory Emax model as a function of Cmin. The estimated maximum decrease in FDHT uptake was about 71% 
(RSE=30%) and the apalutamide concentration resulting in EC50 was 1.2 μg/mL (RSE=123%). Based on 
apalutamide steady-state Cmin and variability (CV%=27), Monte Carlo simulation suggested that 
approximately 100%, 100%, 99%, and 28% of subjects are predicted to exceed EC50, EC60, EC70, and EC80, 
respectively, at the dose of 240 mg once daily. Hence, data support that the 240 mg once daily dose used in the 
Phase 3 study provided adequate inhibition of the AR signaling pathway. 
The safety and tolerability of apalutamide was established at doses up to 480 mg per day (N=3) with no DLTs, 
which provides additional safety margin for the 240 mg once daily dose. 
Apalutamide 240 mg once daily was selected as the appropriate dose for the treatment of patients with 
NM-CRPC. The 240 mg once daily dose was evaluated in the Phase 3 study based on the safety and tolerability 
observed in the first-in-human study up to 480 mg, evaluation of PSA responses across the dose range, and a 
12-week PSA response rate of 89% for subjects with NM-CRPC at the 240 mg dose. Inhibition of FDHT uptake, 
nearly plateaued in the majority of subjects at exposure observed following administration of 240 mg. The 
observed clinical exposure at 240 mg was well within the concentration required for maximum tumor regression 
in mouse xenograft models. There was no significant exposure-to-MFS relationship when analyzed by quartiles 
of exposure, suggesting variability of exposure including dose interruptions and dose reductions with the 240 
mg dose did not significantly impact efficacy. A higher percentage of subjects (11%) in the apalutamide arm had 
a dose reduction due to an AE compared with the placebo arm (3%). The relationship between exposure and the 
incidence of adverse drug reactions was strongest with skin rash and weight decrease. The dose reduction as 
currently implemented in the Phase 3 clinical study by reducing apalutamide dose to 180 mg once daily, or 120 
mg once daily per study protocol, is appropriate for subjects who experience an AE. The totality of the data 
including the exposure-response analysis based support the clinical dose of 240 mg once daily. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 60/139 
  
  
Dose selection of 240 mg with potential reduction based on safety and tolerability has been properly justified for 
patients with NM-CRPC based on evaluation of the effect of apalutamide exposure on biomarkers, safety and 
efficacy data. The tactics of dose reduction were properly clarified by the applicant. 
Cardiac Electrophysiology 
The effect of apalutamide 240 mg once daily on the QTc interval was evaluated in 45 subjects with CRPC in a 
dedicated QT study. At steady state, the largest ΔQTcF was 12.4 msec and the upper bound of its associated 
90% CI was 16.0 msec. Across all timepoints the ΔQTcF and upper bounds of their associated 90% CIs were 
below the threshold of 20 msec. 
PK/PD analysis showed a concentration-dependent increase in ΔQTcF and predicted a prolongation of 13.81 
msec at the mean Cmax of 5.95 μg/mL at steady state with an upper bound of 2-sided 90% CI of 17.85 msec. 
Overall, no large difference (ie, greater than 20 msec) was observed between the mean ΔQT interval change 
from baseline in subjects with CRPC treated with apalutamide 240 mg once daily. However, it should be taken 
into account that upper bound of the 95% one-side CI of QTc prolongation effect is higher than 10 ms. This does 
not imply that the drug is pro-arrhythmic. However, further electrocardiographic follow up in late phase studies 
is recommended. According to ICH guideline E14 –question and answers (EMA/CHMP/ICH/310133/2008), 
question 9, when QT study resulted in a positive finding (the 95% one-side CI of QTc prolongation effect > 10 
ms) at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation <20 ms, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is 
recommended in further clinical trials. Although intensive monitoring has not been conducted in the pivoltal 
study, 100 patients were analyses on QT prolongation, none patient reported QTc interval >480 or QTc interval 
increases from baseline >30 were observed. Two patients reported ventricular tachycardia event and 13 
patients reported syncope event.  
Exposure-Efficacy Analysis 
In SPARTAN (Study 003), apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide exposures, measured as the AUC0-24, 
were 115 μg.h/mL (range: 19.8-291 μg.h/mL) and 152 μg.h/mL (range: 44.1-299 μg.h/mL), respectively. 
The exposure levels achieved at apalutamide 240 mg once daily have been proven to be efficacious in extending 
the MFS in subjects with NM-CRPC. No statistically significant exposure-MFS relationship was found for 
apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide when evaluated by quartiles of exposure. 
Exposure-Safety Analysis 
Including the placebo group, incidence of fatigue, fall, skin rash, weight decrease, and arthralgia, at any grade, 
had a positive and statistically significant relationship with apalutamide exposure. The magnitude of the 
association varied across the different AEs and was strongest with skin rash and weight decrease. Consequently, 
within the exposure range observed in apalutamide-treated subjects, ie, after excluding the treatment 
difference with placebo, the exposure-response relationship was only statistically significant for skin rash and 
weight decrease. 
Although some of the predicted decreases in incidence were small, dose reduction, as currently implemented in 
the Phase 3 clinical study, will likely improve apalutamide tolerability in subjects who develop toxicity after 
apalutamide treatment starts at 240 mg/day.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No dose adjustments recommendations are accepted for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
based on results at singe dose. However, a Phase I, single dose, clinical PK study in healthy non-cancer subjects 
with normal hepatic function and non-cancer subjects with severe hepatic impairment is required (see RMP). 
Meanwhile further information is not available on patients with severe impairment, apalutamide is not 
recommended in this population (see SmPC). 
In 1020 study thyroid-stimulating hormone increases exceeding the upper limit of normal were observed in 48% 
of subjects during study drug treatment (thyroid hormone levels usually remained within normal limits). The 
applicant justified this increases TSH due to induction of UGT. Enzalutamide was also an inducer of UGT. 
However, the impact of enzalutamide on THS hormone was not notified. Apparently, these differences may be 
due to the lack of TSH or related thyroid function test for enzalutamide and systemic monitoring of serum TSH 
for apalutamide.  
The following recommendations were included in the SmPC: 
Concomitant use of Erleada with medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., darunavir, 
felodipine, midazolam, simvastatin), CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam, omeprazole), or CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin, 
phenytoin) can result in lower exposure to these medications. Substitution for these medications is 
recommended when possible or evaluate for loss of efficacy if medication is continued. If given with warfarin, 
monitor INR during Erleada treatment. 
Concomitant use of Erleada with medications that are substrates of P-gp (e.g., colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, 
digoxin), BCRP or OATP1B1 (e.g, lapatinib, methotrexate, rosuvastatin, repaglinide) can result in lower 
exposure of these medications. Use caution if substrates of P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 must be co-administered 
with Erleada and evaluate for loss of efficacy if medication is continued. 
Concomitant administration of Erleada with medications that are substrates of UGT (e.g., levothyroxine, valproic 
acid) can result in lower exposure to these medications. Use caution if substrates of UGT must be 
co-administered with Erleada and evaluate for loss of efficacy. 
In vitro, apalutamide is an inhibitor and inducer of CYP2B6. However, according to the applicant’s justification 
there was limited usage of CYP2B6 substrates (eg, efavirenz, bupropion, methadone, cyclophosphamide) in 
subjects with NM-CRPC according to the current database for the SPARTAN study. Efavirenz and bupropion were 
excluded per protocol. Methadone was permitted in SPARTAN, but there was no record of methadone usage thus 
far. Cyclophosphamide was commonly used in the treatment of certain malignancies including lymphomas and 
breast cancer, but its use for treatment of subjects with prostate cancer would be rare. Given the lack of CYP2B6 
substrates that are likely to be used in the target population, further in vivo drug-drug interaction assessment 
with CYP2B6 probe substrates was not considered to be required. Even considering this fact, conduction of an in 
vivo study with a probe substrate of CYP2B6 is recommended. In any case, it was clearly reflected in the SmPC 
that the potential of apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide as an inhibitor and inducer of CYP2B6 has not 
been study in vivo. A recommendation of caution with substrates of CYP2B6 (including examples) was included 
in the SmPC.  
Apalutamide is an inhibitor of the renal transporters OCT2, MATEs, and OAT3 in vitro. The potential of 
apalutamide to affect substrates of these renal transporters was assessed using PBPK modeling. Simulations 
suggest that apalutamide does not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to metformin (OCT2/MATEs 
substrate) and benzylpenicillin (OAT3 substrate). However, it should be kept in mind that in the guideline on the 
Investigation of Drug Interaction, the PBPK models are not mentioned for inhibition of transport proteins. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 62/139 
  
  
Qualification of PBPK model for inhibition of transport proteins was not sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the 
results of this population PBPK model were considered only as supportive data and information on this PBPK was 
not reflected in the SmPC. 
After an additional review of all information available on QT prolongation from all studies conducted risk of 
potential QT prolongation in patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease cannot be fully ruled out. 
Therefore, QT prolongation study in this population would be interesting. A Post Authorisation Safety Study 
(PASS) could be useful to better characterize the risks of use in the subgroup of population of patients with 
clinically significant cardiovascular disease. A prospective and interventional cohort study would ideally be the 
best way to evaluate the incidence of cardiovascular events and analyse follow-up of cardiovascular functions 
among patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, we have some concerns regarding the feasibility of this 
type of study at this stage, more precisely, in relation to the availability of sufficient sample size and length of 
follow-up to adequately address this. Thus, a feasibility assessment report of this study will be submitted. This 
observational study in NM-CRPC patients on ADT with clinically significant cardiovascular conditions was 
included in the RMP. 
With current available data on QT prolongation, information currently reflected in the SmPC is considered 
acceptable (see SmPC 4.4 and 4.5). 
The results from the Exposure-Efficacy Analysis support that 240 mg once daily dose of apalutamide provides 
efficacious exposure in the majority of subjects with similar efficacy across the exposure range. 
The tactics of dose reduction were properly substantiated.

Subjects were to start administration of study drug within 4 days after randomization. Apalutamide 240 mg (8 
x 30 mg softgel capsules then 4 x 60 mg tablets [Amendment 6)]) or matching placebo was to be taken orally 
once daily with or without food. With the softgel capsules only, subjects could switch to a twice daily dosing 
regimen (4 tables each period) if gastrointestinal issues arose with the once daily schedule. If an 
apalutamide/placebo dose was missed, it was to be omitted and not made up. For the purposes of this study, a 
treatment cycle consisted of 4 weeks (28 days). 
The dose and frequency of administration of the GnRH analogue as ADT was to follow the prescribing information 
in the respective label. Choice of GnRH analogue or dose could be adjusted if clinically indicated to achieve and 
maintain castrate concentrations of testosterone (<50 ng/dL). 
Intrasubject dose interruptions and/or reductions were permitted provided that study discontinuation criteria 
had not been met. 
CHMP assessment report

Subjects received apalutamide or placebo at a dose of 240 mg given orally, daily until development of 
metastasis or other reason for treatment discontinuation with concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Metastasis-free survival (MFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to first evidence of 
BICR-confirmed radiographically detectable bone or soft tissue distant metastasis or date of death due to any 
cause (whichever occurs earlier) + 1 day.  
Any patient without metastasis or death was censored on the date of the last RECIST 1.1 assessment. If the 
patient has no tumor assessment after the baseline visit they will be censored at the date of randomization +1 
day. 
Secondary endpoints 
OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause +1 day (i.e., 
date of death or censoring– date of randomization + 1). Any patient not known to have died at the time of 
analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. 
Time to metastasis (TTM), was defined as the time from randomization to first evidence of BICR-confirmed 
radiographically detectable bone or soft tissue distant metastasis + 1 day. Patients without metastasis were 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 66/139 
  
  
censored on the date of the last tumor assessment (or, if no tumor assessment was performed after the baseline 
visit, at the date of randomization + 1 day). 
Progression-free survival (PFS), was to be assessed and defined as the time from randomization to first 
documentation of BICR-confirmed radiographic progressive disease or death due to any cause (whichever 
occurs first) + 1 day. Progressive disease (PD) was based on RECIST v1.1, and further defined as follows: 
- 
For patients with at least one measurable lesion, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum 
of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Furthermore, the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression. 
- 
For patients with only non-measurable disease observed on CT or MRI scans, unequivocal progression 
(representative of overall disease status change) or the appearance of one or more new lesions was 
considered progression. For new bone lesions detected on bone scans, a second imaging modality (e.g., 
CT or MRI) was required to confirm progression. 
Progression-free survival data for patients without loco-regional disease was censored on the date of the last 
tumor assessment (or, if no tumor assessment was performed after the baseline visit, at the date of 
randomization + 1 day). Additional censoring rules could vary according to whether the analysis is performed for 
US or ex-US regulatory purposes. 
Time to symptomatic progression was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of documentation 
in the CRF of any of the following (whichever occurs earlier) + 1 day: 
-  Development of a skeletal-related event (SRE): pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or need 
for surgical intervention or radiation therapy to the bone. 
- 
Pain progression or worsening of disease-related symptoms requiring initiation of a new systemic 
anti-cancer therapy. 
-  Development of clinically significant symptoms due to loco-regional tumor progression requiring 
surgical intervention or radiation therapy. 
Adverse event, concomitant medication, or survival follow-up CRFs might also be the source of these findings. 
Time to symptomatic progression for patients who did not experience any of the events described above were 
censored on the date on which they were last known to be event-free. 
Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was defined as the time from randomization to documentation of a 
new cytotoxic chemotherapy being administered to the patient + 1 day. 
Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy for patients who do not start a cytotoxic chemotherapy were 
censored on the date of last contact. 
Other exploratory endpoints included Second Progression-free Survival (PFS2), PSA response and time to PSA 
progression and Health-related quality of life and cancer-specific symptoms using FACT-P and EQ-5D.  
Blood and plasma samples were collected at multiple time points and archived FFPE tumor blocks or tumor slides 
could be analyzed for development of the F876L mutation and for high risk features (FFPE tumor blocks or tumor 
slides) and associations could be made with clinical endpoints as follows: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 67/139 
  
  
F876L mutation and other DNA mutations from cfDNA in plasma collected at Day 1 of Cycles 1, 11, 17, 25, 37, 
and End-of-Treatment Visit. 
AR splice variants or other RNA anomalies in cfRNA in blood collected at Day 1 of Cycles 1 11, and 
End-of-Treatment Visit. 
Global mRNA expression levels in FFPE tumor blocks or tumor slides to identify expression levels of ‘high-risk’ 
classifier genes. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy analysis was event-driven and was to take place when approximately 372 MFS events had 
occurred. The study was designed with 90% power to detect a 30% reduction in the risk of developing 
metastases (HR = 0.70) for subjects receiving apalutamide, with a 2-sided α of 0.05. Based on an assumed 
median MFS of 25 months in the placebo arm, this treatment effect represents an increase in the median MFS 
of approximately 11 months (from 25 months to 36 months). Assuming an accrual period of 24 months (with 
75% of the patients accrued in the second year), approximately 1,200 subjects were needed. 
The study was also designed with 85% power to detect a 25% reduction (HR = 0.75) in the risk of death for 
subjects receiving apalutamide, based on an assumed median OS of 49 months in the placebo arm. This 
treatment effect represents an increase in the median OS of approximately 16 months (from 49 to 65 months). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either ARN-509 or placebo. The randomization was stratified by 
PSADT (≤ 6 months vs. > 6 months), Bone-sparing agent use (Yes vs. No), Loco-regional disease (N0 vs. N1). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ARN-509 compared to placebo in patients with 
high risk NM-CRPC as measured by metastasis-free survival (MFS), based on blinded independent central review 
(BICR) of tumor assessments. If the primary efficacy endpoint of MFS is significant, the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints, TTM, PFS, time to symptomatic progression, OS, and time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
were to be tested in that order according to the pre-specified hierarchical testing. While this is the final analysis 
for time to metastasis and progression free survival, it is the first interim analysis for the other endpoints and 
were to be tested with pre-specified O’Brian-Fleming alpha spending that provides strong control of family-wise 
type I error rate at 0.05 (2-sided). 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, incorporating the randomization stratification factors 
as documented on the IVRS, unless otherwise specified. Time-to-event endpoints will be summarized using the 
Kaplan-Meier method 3 and displayed graphically where appropriate. Median event times and 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval for each median will be provided. Cox proportional-hazard models, including the 
stratification factors at baseline, will be used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval 
(CI). Response endpoints (eg, PSA response rate) will be summarized using descriptive statistics for categorical 
data by treatment group. The relative risk (treatment:control) will be reported along with the associated 2-tailed 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 68/139 
  
  
95% CIs. The two treatment groups will be compared using the stratified Mantel-Haenszel test; Fisher’s exact 
test may be used if the expected counts in some cells are small. 
Full Analysis (Intent-to-Treat) Population: All eligible patients who are randomized into the study, with 
study drug assignments designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether patients receive 
study drug or receive a different drug from that to which they were randomized to will be included in the 
analyses of all efficacy and clinical benefit endpoints and patient characteristics. 
Safety Analysis Population: All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug, with treatment 
assignments designated according to actual study treatment received will be the primary population for 
evaluating safety and treatment compliance and administration.

Common concomitant medications, reported for ≥50% of subjects included analgesics (apalutamide: 61%; 
placebo: 57%), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (apalutamide: 55%; placebo: 50%), and lipid 
modifying agents (apalutamide: 50%; placebo: 51%). 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT population, which included 1207 randomized subjects (806 
subjects in the apalutamide arm and 401 subjects in the placebo arm). As of the clinical cut-off date (19 May 
2017), the median survival follow-up time for all subjects was 20.3 months. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis- Metastasis-Free Survival by Blinded Independent Central Review 
One hundred eighty-four (23%) subjects in the apalutamide arm and 194 (48%) subjects in the placebo arm 
were reported with distant metastases by BICR or had died (Table 21) (based on ex-US censoring rules is 
presented in Table 33).

Figure 6. Kaplan-Meier Plot of Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Metastasis-Free Survival (MFS) for 
US Regulatory; Intent-to-treat Population (Study ARN-509-003) 
Results of the analysis of MFS with radiographic assessment by the investigator are consistent with MFS results 
by BICR. Treatment with apalutamide significantly decreased the risk of metastasis or death by 75% compared 
with placebo (HR=0.251; 95% CI: 0.205, 0.308; p<0.0001). The median TTM or death was 41.2 months for the 
apalutamide arm and 14.6 months for the placebo arm. At 12 months, 86% of subjects in the apalutamide arm 
and 54% of subjects in the placebo arm were event-free; at 24 months, the event-free rate was 72% compared 
with 28%, respectively. 
Sensitivity Analysis of Metastasis-Free Survival 
In the conduct of this study, it was noted that 152 (13%) subjects were incorrectly stratified at the time of 
randomization. As a sensitivity analysis of the MFS results, a stratified analysis of MFS was performed using 
corrected stratification factors. The results of this analysis (HR=0.286; 95% CI: 0.233, 0.352; p<0.0001) were 
consistent with those of the stratified analysis. 
An MFS sensitivity analysis was performed using corrected stratification factors and ex-US censoring rules. The 
results of this analysis (HR=0.303; 95% CI: 0.249, 0.370; p<0.0001) were consistent with those of the 
stratified analysis. 
The non-stratified analysis of MFS by BICR using US censoring rules and ex-US censoring rules were provided. 
The results of these analyses (HR=0.295; 95% CI: 0.240, 0.362; p<0.0001 and HR=0.310; 95% CI: 0.256, 
0.377; p<0.0001, respectively) were consistent with the stratified analysis.

Secondary Endpoint Analyses- Time to Metastasis 
Time to metastasis (TTM) is defined as the time from randomization to BICR-confirmed radiographically 
detected bone or soft tissue distant metastasis. This was prespecified as the final analysis for TTM. 
Metastasis-free survival was statistically significant, hence, according to the pre specified hierarchical testing 
procedure, TTM is considered to be statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05. (Table 22). (data 
based on ex-US censoring rules is presented in Table 33.)

Secondary Endpoint Analyses- Progression-free Survival 
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to first BICR-confirmed radiographic 
progressive disease (distant or local/regional) or death due to any cause. This was prespecified as the final 
analysis for PFS. Time to metastasis was statistically significant, hence, according to the pre-specified 
hierarchical testing procedure, PFS is considered to be statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05.

Secondary Endpoint Analyses- Time to Symptomatic Progression 
Time to symptomatic progression is defined as the time from randomization to development of a skeletal-related 
event, pain progression or worsening of disease-related symptoms requiring initiation of a new systemic 
anti-cancer therapy, or development of clinically significant symptoms due to loco-regional tumor progression 
requiring surgical intervention or radiation therapy. This was prespecified in the hierarchical testing scheme to 
be tested for significance if MFS, TTM, and PFS were all significant. The alpha level for this test at this interim is 
0.00008 using the O’Brien-Fleming type alpha spending function to control the overall alpha at 0.05 for this 
endpoint with this interim analysis.

Secondary Endpoint Analyses- Overall Survival 
This is the first of 2 interim analyses of OS as prespecified in the protocol. Overall survival was to be tested if 
MFS, TTM, PFS, and time to symptomatic progression were all statistically significant.

The analysis did not reach the prespecified statistical significance level based on the O’Brien-Fleming efficacy 
boundary (p=0.000012). The median survival was not reached in the apalutamide arm and was 39.0 months in 
the placebo arm.

Secondary Endpoint Analyses- Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy 
Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy is defined as the time from randomization to the date of initiation 
of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer. This is the first interim analysis for time to initiation of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. A formal statistical assessment of this endpoint was to be performed if MFS, TTM, PFS, time to 
symptomatic progression, and OS were all statistically significant.

Other Efficacy Endpoints- Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Patient-reported outcome results indicated that there was no detriment to overall health-related quality of life 
with the addition of apalutamide to ADT. Similar mean changes from baseline or median time to worsening in the 
FACT-P were observed in the 2 treatment arms. For nearly all time points, no differences between apalutamide 
and placebo were observed in change from baseline across the EQ-5D index or VAS. 
However, the Applicant failed to provide the information of improvement of HRQoL in patient in the apalutamide 
arm. For use of apalutamide in these clinical settings for nonmetastatic cancer, it seems to be important 
supporting finding that should be analysed and improvement clearly showed. After requesting, the Applicant 
provided an additional information on differences in HRQoL for patients in apalutamide versus placebo arms. 
Although the Applicant claims that “There was little to no change observed around the median onset of 
hypertension, rash, and fatigue compared with baseline across the FACT-P total score and subscales. For all 
selected TEAEs, the HRQoL scores were similar throughout the TEAE period compared with baseline regardless 
of treatment arm”, the absence of proper statistical analysis providing differences between arms using 
appropriate tests gives no information for making such a conclusion. For example, in the Table E8 provided by 
the Applicant, it can be clearly seen that more selected adverse events (AEs) occur in the apalutamide arm in 
comparison with placebo. The Applicant did not performed analysis of statistical significance providing tables of 
per cent of distribution of AEs between groups. That makes the proper conclusion on statistical difference 
impossible. However, even looking on raw data, the higher prevalence of AEs in apalutamide arm can be 
mentioned. 
Furthermore, the Applicant provided the information on participants’ QoL with and without AEs for each AE and 
for each one of the 29 cycles of the study individually. There is still a lack of statistical information of overall 
changes in QoL in participants with and without AEs. The huge amount of information on different parameters of 
QoL during each one of study cycles, including answers of participants on each one of the study questions, does 
not allow to perform proper conclusion on differences between study arms. 
Other Efficacy Endpoints- PSA Response 
The PSA response rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved ≥50% decline in PSA value from 
baseline assessed by a central laboratory according to PCWG2 criteria. The PSA response was confirmed by a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 87/139 
 
  
  
central laboratory measurement taken ≥4 weeks later. A confirmed PSA response was observed in 90% of 
subjects in the apalutamide arm and 2.2% of subjects in the placebo arm (Table 21; p<0.0001); total response 
(confirmed and unconfirmed) was observed in 93% and 3.5% of subjects, respectively. Subjects treated with 
apalutamide demonstrated a 40-fold improvement in PSA response over subjects treated with placebo.

An overall updated PFS2 analysis was also conducted, based on an additional year of data collection since the 
original application with a CCO date of 17 May 2018. For the placebo arm, most subjects did receive approved 
therapies for mCRPC after their MFS event. Nonetheless, the apalutamide arm continued to be highly favored for 
PFS2, as defined by the time from randomization to progression with first subsequent anti-cancer therapy or 
death (PFS2) (HR=0.499; CI: 0.393, 0.632; p<0.0001). These results are consistent with the results from the 
initial analysis. PFS2 data continue to mature but there is no planned/required number of such events for any 
further formal analysis of this data.

Biomarkers 
Exploratory biomarker analysis was performed on blood samples collected at progression to identify markers of 
cross resistance to subsequent therapy. Because the ARV-7 splice variant of the AR is a potential mechanism of 
resistance for AR directed therapies, samples collected at the time of the first disease progression were tested 
for presence of ARV-7. ARV-7 was shown to occur in only 3 of 28 subjects (10.7%) with a progression sample 
that was tested in the apalutamide arm and 6 of 36 subjects (16.7%) with a progression sample that was tested 
in the placebo arm. In this population, duration on subsequent therapy in ARV-7 positive subjects was 
marginally shorter than ARV-7 negative subjects (24.9 months versus 28.5 months).

Further characterization of MFS 
In an exploratory multivariate analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model (with treatment in the model) was 
used to identify the following variables as the important favorable prognostic factors (p-value < 0.05) for MFS: 
PSA baseline ≤ 7.8 ng/mL; a PSADT >6 month; loco-regional disease status of N0; and Gleason Score ≤7. 
Consequently, the late progressors are defined as having all 4 of the important favourable prognostic factors. 
The early progressors are defined as having all 4 of the following conditions: PSA baseline >7.8 ng/mL; a PSADT 
≤6 months; loco-regional disease status of N1; and Gleason Score ≥8.  
Subjects not defined as early or late are referred to as medium progressors. 
The consistent significant treatment effect of apalutamide on MFS has been shown across the 3 progressor 
groups (early progressors: HR[95% CI]=0.142[0.048, 0.424] with a p-value of <0.0001; medium progressors: 
HR[95% CI]=0.304[0.248,0.374] with a p-value of <0.0001; late progressors: HR[95% CI]=0.263[0.101, 
0.685] with a p-value of 0.0033). In addition, an exploratory interaction test between treatment and progressor 
type yielded a p-value of 0.1691, indicating that there is no significant heterogenous treatment effect of 
apalutamide among the 3 progressor groups.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Two studies were presented for the analysis of efficacy: pivotal phase III study ARN-509-003 and phase II study 
ARN-509-001. There was a difference in these studies both in the definition of high risk (PSADT ≤10 months for 
ARN-509-003 study and PSADT ≤10 months or PSA value ≥8 ng/mL within 3 months prior to enrollment for 
ARN-509-001 study) and in the primary outcome (MFS for ARN-509-003 study, but MFS is only secondary 
endpoint for the study ARN-509-001). Therefore, the direct comparison/meta-analysis of these studies was 
rather impossible.

Controlled Trials 
Supportive study(ies) 
Supportive Phase II study ARN-509-001 included men with progressive advanced CRPC. Study population was 
similar to that of ARN-509-003 study. Study compared effects of three groups of participants: (1) participants 
with NM-CRPC (N=51, efficacy population N=47), (2) participants with mCRPC, not previously treated with 
ZYTIGA (N=25), and (3) participants with mCRPC previously treated with ZYTIGA (N=21). See table below 
(source: SCE provided by Applicant).  
Four of the 51 subjects with NM-CRPC in Study ARN-509-001 had bone metastasis at baseline and were 
excluded from the efficacy analysis set (Cohort 1, N=47 efficacy population). Men were in high risk of NM CRPC 
defined as a PSADT ≤10 months or PSA value ≥8 ng/mL within 3 months prior to enrolment. Participants were 
treated with 240 mg apalutamide daily.

In this study MFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until new metastatic lesions are observed on 
computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scans and/or radionuclide bone scans (according to PCWG2 
criteria slightly modified to reflect tumor evaluations performed every 16 weeks) or death occurs, whichever is 
first. Subjects were to be discontinued from treatment for documented disease progression (PSA progression 
and radiographic progression or clinical progression alone), however, a large proportion of subjects discontinued 
treatment due to signs of disease progression that did not meet the radiographic progression endpoint. 
At the time of the clinical cut-off date, 42 subjects (82%) from Cohort 1 discontinued treatment; treatment was 
ongoing for 9 (18%) subjects. The primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment were disease 
progression (13 subjects, 26%), TEAEs (9 subjects, 18%), and “other” (7 subjects, 14%); “other” reasons were 
for unconfirmed progression. The median duration of treatment was 27 months for Cohort 1. PSA responses at 
12 weeks showed treatment with apalutamide resulted in a 50% decline in PSA from baseline at Week 12 for 
89% of subjects in Cohort 1. The PSA response rate at any time during Phase 2 of the study was 94% for 
subjects in Cohort 1. The median percent change at Week 12 was -85.4% (range: -99.9, 52.2). 
Addition of supportive data from from Cohort 1 (NM-CRPC) of the Phase 2 portion of Study ARN-509-001 
population may increase the total number of patients for analysis of efficacy, however, it should be kept in mind 
that difference in the baseline characteristics and different definition of high risk is a strong indication of the 
selection bias and has an impact on the efficacy results. 
Besides definition of MFS in this supportive study and main study (ARN-509-001) was slightly different. In the 
main study MFS was defined as the time from randomization to first evidence of blinded independent central 
review-confirmed radiographically detectable bone or soft tissue distant metastasis or death due to any cause 
(whichever occurs earlier).  
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of subjects in study ARN-509-003 and the NM-CRPC 
cohort (Cohort 1) of study ARN-509-001 were mostly similar. However, subjects in study ARN-509-003, had a 
higher median age compared to subjects from Cohort 1 of study ARN-509-001 (74 years vs 71), with 26% of 
subjects 80 years of age or older compared with a median age 71 for. Additionally, subjects in study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 99/139 
 
  
  
ARN-509-003 had overall higher baseline tumor stages and were more likely to have a Gleason score >7 
compared with subjects in Cohort 1 of study ARN-509-001.  
Although results of efficacy analysis of this study seem to be supportive for the pivotal, ARN-509-003 study, the 
direct comparison and/or unification of these two studies is impossible due to different baseline characteristics 
of participants, different main objectives, different study designs and a small number of participants in the 
ARN-509-001 study. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The company has submitted an application for marketing authorisation of apalutamide, a next generation, orally 
bioavailable, androgen receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. 
Apalutamide inhibits androgen receptor (AR) nuclear translocation and binding to the androgen response 
elements, resulting in the inhibition of downstream transcription of AR-regulated genes. Apalutamide is a potent 
and selective antagonist of the AR without significant agonist properties. 
The proposed dose of apalutamide is 240 mg  taken orally once-daily.  
The current application is based on study ARN-509-003 (SPARTAN): A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Study of Apalutamide compared with placebo in subjects with high risk 
Non-Metastatic (M0) Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. Supportive evidence comes from cohort 1 of the 
Phase 2 proportion of study ARN-509-001 in which 47 subjects with NM-CRPC have available efficacy data. 
Key elements of study ARN-509-003 were discussed in several advices with the CHMP’s SAWP and discussions 
were also held with national competent authorities (DK; ES, LT; UK). The CHMP agreed with the overall 
development approach, in particular endorsing trial population, placebo as comparator, primary and secondary 
endpoints and the analysis of biomarkers. It was emphasized that even if an improvement in MFS was observed, 
it would also be needed to understand the impact of treatment on survival of these patients, and in this regard, 
secondary endpoints such as Symprog and OS would become relevant during the decision making process. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Focusing on the main study, the inclusion/exclusion criteria allowed the inclusion of patients on treatment with 
androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH agonist/antagonist or prior bilateral orchiectomy, but castration 
resistant in terms of PSA progression (M0CRPC) at high risk as defined by PSADT < 10 months. 
The definition of high-risk population seems to be the cause of treating them with apalutamide, given the high 
risk of developing metastases and eventually the potential impact on both, OS and QoL. There are no data 
whether apalutamide would be effective in a non-high risk NMCRPC. 
The primary objectives of the study are clearly defined: to assess the efficacy of apalutamide compared with 
placebo in terms of MFS. From an individual-patient perspective and reasonably, from a clinical view the use of 
this variable is understood. However, study design will identify asymptomatic metastases in most of cases and 
in this regard the clinical value of apalutamide treatment was questioned. Other variables that could depict the 
clinical relevance of a mere delay in asymptomatic metastases are considered relevant when it comes to 
assessing the benefit risk balance of the proposed therapy, i.e. time to symptomatic progression or Overall 
survival.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 100/139 
  
  
Furthermore, multiple exploratory endpoints were defined, including biomarker analysis. This is endorsed as 
resistance to androgen therapy is eventually shown in the vast majority of prostate cancer patients. Due to the 
potential impact of apalutamide on next-line therapies, which in first-line of metastatic disease can include 
first-generation endocrine therapy (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate), cross-resistance development is 
a possibility.  
The methods to analyse the primary and secondary endpoints seem, overall, acceptable. The company has 
followed the CHMP’s SA in relation to BICR assessment for the primary endpoint. 
The sample size calculations were based on the expected amount of MFS events, the total number of planned 
interim analyses and OS median. This approach is considered adequate. An expected HR of 0.70 was used for 
calculations. Of note, the study was powered to find differences in OS. 
The blind design of study, even supported, was probably risky taking into account the comparator arm and the 
PSA progression. Nevertheless, as the primary endpoint evaluated by a BICR, no major objections are raised. 
Patients were randomized to a 2 (ARN-509): 1 (placebo) ratio using three stratification factors: PSADT, 
bone-Sparing agent use and loco-regional disease. Stratification factors are also agreed, although a region 
stratum should be included. In this regard, is reassuring that the subgroups analysis on MFS did not show 
important differences according to regions.  
The phase 2 supportive study (ARN-509-001) included a cohort of patients with no metastatic disease (51 
subjects enrolled; 47 subjects included in the efficacy analysis set). In Study ARN-509-001, high risk was 
defined as a PSADT ≤10 months or PSA value ≥8 ng/mL within 3 months prior to enrolment. The primary 
efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2 portion of Study ARN-509-001 was PSA response at 12 weeks according to the 
PCWG2 criteria. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
From the 2132 patients initially screened 925 were found ineligible and in the SPARTAN trial, between 14 Oct 
2013 and 15 Dec 2016, 1207 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment with apalutamide (806 
patients) or placebo (401 patients). A total of 332 study sites in 26 countries randomized patients in this study. 
The distribution of patients according to country could be an important factor to take into account at the time of 
assessing the impact of new hormonal agents (abiraterone) after progression, and as consequence on OS.  
The data cut-off for the primary efficacy analysis was 19 May 2017. At that time 61% of subjects in the 
apalutamide arm and 30% of subjects in the placebo arm continued on study treatment. As of the 17 May 2018 
clinical cutoff (CCO), 391 (48.7%) of subjects in the apalutamide arm still remain on treatment 
The study protocol was amended eight times. Per amendment INT-6 (18-May-2015) study formulation changed 
from softgel capsules to tablets. Amendment INT-8 (15-March-2017) introduced changes in the hierarchical 
testing of secondary endpoints including re-estimation of time points for next analysis of symptomatic 
progression and other endpoints.  
A total of 117 patients (9.7%) (9.2% in the apalutamide group and 9.9% in the placebo group) had major 
protocol deviations during the study. The most common protocol deviation was related to patients not fulfilling 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, although percentages are balanced between groups and no impact on study results 
is expected, the applicant was requested to further clarify the inclusion/exclusion criteria not met. After 
clarification, no specific trends were observed among major protocol deviations for inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Regarding baseline characteristics of trial population, median age at randomization was 74 years in both study 
arms. The great majority of patients were White (66.3%), 11.6% were Asian and 5.6% of trial population were 
Black or African American. The majority of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status 0 (77.4%). The 
median PSA DT was 4.40 months (range: 0.7 to 10.0 months) across treatment groups and most patients 
(71.3%) had PSADT ≤ 6 months. 
No patient presented metastasis at diagnosis. Loco-regional disease (N1) was present in 16.4% of trial 
population according to patient distribution according to stratification factors. Some differences in the 
classification of patients according to baseline characteristics and distribution by stratification factors are noted. 
One third of the population had previously received both surgery and radiotherapy. 99.5% of trial population 
had previously received hormonal therapy, being GnRHa (96.7%) and first generation antiandrogens the most 
frequently used (73.1%). Patients received none or 1 prior lines of prostate cancer therapy (1 prior lines: 7.9% 
in apalutamide and 8.0% in placebo received other prior prostate cancer therapy). Almost all patients received 
at least 1 prior hormonal therapy (99.5%), 21.0% in placebo arm and 19.5% in apalutamide received 1 prior 
hormonal therapy and 78.8% in placebo arm and 80.0% in apalutamide received ≥ 2 prior hormonal therapy. A 
minority, 1.7% and 2.1% in apalutaminde and placebo arms respectively had previously received 
chemotherapy. Prior treatments seem to be well balance between both groups. 
More subjects needed a dose reduction and more subjects discontinued the treatment due to AE after first and 
after second dose reduction in apalutamide arm. Mean time to first dose reduction as well as time to 
discontinuation of treatment after the first dose reduction is shorter in apalutamide arm. Although the median 
time to second dose reduction and the time to discontinuation of the treatment after the second dose reduction 
are shorter in the apalutamide arm, the range of both these times is very wide showing a high dispersity of 
observed data. Therefore, it can be assumed that dose reduction and discontinuation due to AEs is related to 
apalutamide.  A statistically significant difference between placebo and apalutamide arms for discontinuation 
because of adverse events was observed. 
Results from SPARTAN trial in the efficacy target population of patients at the cut-off date of 19-May-2017 
included the main analysis planned for MFS (BIRC assessed) and the first interim analysis for time to 
symptomatic progression (1 IA planned plus 1 final analyses), OS and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy (2 IA 
planned plus 1 final analysis for both).  
With an event rate of 22.8% and 48.4% for apalutamide and placebo arms respectively, a statistically significant 
improvement in MFS was observed for apalutamide compared to placebo (HR: 0.280; 95% CI: 0.227, 0.346). 
The median MFS (95% CI) was 40.51 months (95% CI: NE, NE) in the apalutamide  group and 16.20 months 
(95% CI: 14.59, 18.40) in the placebo group (Δ 24.3 months). Even when differences have been observed 
among reduction in bone, soft tissue and visceral metastases in apalutamide arm, all of them (reduction in bone, 
soft tissue and visceral metastases) showed relevant reduction in comparison with placebo arm. Most of the MFS 
events were due to appearance of metastases and only 9 patients in the apalutamide arm and 3 patients in 
placebo arms died without evidence of metastases. K-M curves showed an early and clear increasing separation 
form first tumour assessment (4 months) onwards with MFS event-free rates consistently favouring active 
treatment at different time points: event-free rate at 12 months: 87% in the apalutamide vs 59% in the 
placebo); at 24 months: 70% vs. 33%, respectively. 
Two different analyses according to different censoring rules were submitted (US Regulatory censoring rules vs. 
ex-US Regulatory censoring rules) due to differing stratification approaches. Although the US Regulatory 
approach is considered the most conservative both show consistent results and no concerns arise. Main results 
are also supported by investigator assessment (HR: 0.251; 95% CI: 0.205, 0.308) and several sensitivity

analyses (upper limit of the 95% CI no greater than 0.310). The sensitivity analyses for secondary endpoints 
were also provided, giving similar results between analysis with both stratifications. 
MFS showed consistent results across all subgroups analysed.  
In an exploratory multivariate analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model (with treatment in the model) was 
used to identify the following variables as the important favorable prognostic factors (p-value < 0.05) for MFS: 
PSA baseline ≤ 7.8 ng/mL; a PSADT >6 month; loco-regional disease status of N0; and Gleason Score ≤7. 
However, as stratification during the randomization procedure was performed on PSADT (≤ 6 months vs. > 6 
months), bone-sparing agent use (Yes vs. No) and loco-regional disease (N0 vs. N1), these covariates are not 
eligible to be included into multivariate analysis, as their distribution between study arms should be equal. The 
applicant’s answered that the EMA regulations (2015) “Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical 
trials” suggests that “The factors that are the basis of stratification should normally be included as covariates or 
stratification variables in the primary outcome model, except where stratification was done purely for an 
administrative reason”. It is further noted that p-values for age, baseline ECOG value and number or prior 
hormonal therapies were not significant in the multivariate analysis. According to the MAA, this was because in 
predicting response, the effect of treatment with apalutamide was so strong that it was not impacted by ECOG 
status, age, or number of prior lines of therapy as predictors in the model. 
Based on above mentioned multivariate analysis results, an additional analysis was provided by the applicant in 
order to assess whether there are any difference in efficacy outcomes (MFS) in patients who progressed early vs. 
late progressors. The early progressors were defined as having all 4 of the following conditions identified by 
exploratory multivariate analysis: (PSA baseline >7.8 ng/mL; a PSADT ≤6 months; loco-regional disease status 
of N1; and Gleason Score ≥8). Late progressors are defined as having all 4 of the identified important favourable 
prognostic factors (PSA baseline ≤ 7.8 ng/mL; a PSADT >6 month; loco-regional disease status of N0; and 
Gleason Score ≤7). Consistent treatment effect of apalutamide on MFS has been shown across the 3 progressor 
groups (early progressors: HR[95% CI]=0.142[0.048, 0.424]; medium progressors: HR[95% 
CI]=0.304[0.248,0.374]; late progressors: HR[95% CI]=0.263[0.101, 0.685]). The number of subjects in the 
early (15+23) and late progressors (38+60) groups were small as compared to 
 the medium progressor group (348+723). 
Overall, secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. Treatment with apalutamide 
delayed time to metastasis (TTM) (HR: 0.271; 95% CI: 0.219, 0.335) and PFS (HR: 0.291; 95% CI: 
0.238,0.356). Consistency in both cases is not unexpected as these endpoints are closely related by definition. 
In the case of TTM only deaths events are excluded in comparison to MFS and in the case of PFS all radiological 
progressions are accounted. 
More relevant are results in terms of time to symptomatic progression, OS and time to initiation of Cytotoxic 
Chemotherapy. Data on these three secondary endpoints comes from the first IA planned.  
Despite data on time to symptomatic progression is still immature, event rate of 7.9% in apalutamide arm and 
15.7% in placebo arm, results showed a HR: 0.447; 95% CI: 0.315,0.634 that crossed the pre-specified efficacy 
boundary for significance (p=0.00008) and thus this is to be considered the final analysis. Importantly, the 
definition of this endpoint included a composite of three different events: development of skeletal-related event, 
pain progression or worsening of disease-related symptoms requiring initiation of a new systemic anti-cancer 
therapy, or development of clinically significant symptoms due to loco-regional tumor progression requiring 
surgical intervention or radiation therapy. Whereas an overall effect on the composite endpoint can be observed, 
when split by the different types of events no important differences are observed in the percentages of patients 
who experienced pain progression or worsening of disease –related symptoms only ((24/64) 37.5% in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 103/139 
  
  
apalutamide arm vs. (23/63) 36.5% in placebo arm) and it seems that differences are mainly due to 
skeletal-related events only ((15/ 64) 23.4% in apalutamide arm vs. (12/63) 19.0% in placebo arm) and more 
importantly loco-regional tumour progression only ((12/ 64) 18.8% in apalutamide arm vs. (17/63) 27% in 
placebo arm). However, the limited number of events translates small changes in absolute numbers into greater 
differences in relative numbers, reinforcing the need of more mature data on this endpoint.  
Despite, the observed p-value (0.00000356) crossed the O’Brien-Fleming (OBF)-type efficacy boundary 
(p=0.00008) for significance and thus this will be the only analysis for time to symptomatic progression, the 
number of events cannot be considered enough in order to offer robust data. The applicant clarified that no 
statistical update is planned per the SAP. However, an updated exploratory analysis than does not involve 
further statistical testing was presented. This updated exploratory analysis is overall in line with the previous 
one, although no clinical relevant differences are observed in this endpoint between apalutamide and placebo 
arms. 
OS data also still highly immature (event rate of 7.7% in apalutamide arm and 10.5% in placebo arm) did not 
cross the boundary for statistical significance (HR: 0.700, 95% CI: 0.472, 1.038) and although it appears that 
survival curves start to separate this does not allow any reliable conclusion regarding the potential benefit of 
apalutamide in the long-run. On the recommendation of the IDMC, study ARN-509-003 was unblinded and 
subjects who are randomized to placebo were given the option to receive apalutamide. Indeed, at the time of 
study unblinding, 104 subjects on the placebo arm were given the opportunity to cross over to apalutamide, 75 
subjects went on to receive apalutamide. The Applicant is planning to thoroughly investigate cross-over 
adjusted sensitivity analysis only at the time of the next formal analysis of OS (2023). At time of the May 2018 
CCO, OS data was still highly immature. OS events occurred in 19.0% (76) of subjects in the placebo arm 
patients and 15.4% (124) of subjects in the apalutamide arm. Median OS is not evaluable yet for apalutamide. 
As of 12 September 2018, overall survival (OS) events occurred in 22% (89) of subjects in the placebo arm and 
17% (140) of subjects in the apalutamide arm. The next prespecified, formal statistical inferential analysis of OS 
is expected to take place when a total of 427 deaths have been observed. The current projection for the next 
CSR, which will include the updated OS data, will be available in June 2023. 
At the time on DCO, 21.7% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 55.4% in the placebo arm received any 
subsequent systemic treatment for prostate cancer.  Study protocol, recommended treatment with AA as first 
option for subsequent therapy if available. Accordingly, 71.4% and 72.5% of patients in apalutamide and 
placebo respectively received AA. Enzalutamide was received by 11.4% and 12.6% respectively arm who 
received any subsequent therapy. 
PFS2 data (May 2017 cutoff), with 11.3% and 19.5% of events in apalutamide and placebo arms, showed an 
initial trend towards greater reduction of risk of disease progression with next line therapy or death for patients 
initially allocated to apalutamide arm compared to placebo (HR: 0.489, 95% CI: 0.361, 0.662). Updated data on 
PFS2 (May 2018 cutoff) were provided. This data seems to be in line with previous one. However, PFS2 is still 
immature, median of PFS2 in apalutamide is not evaluable yet. PFS2 events occurred in 29.9% (120) of subjects 
in the placebo arm patients and 20.1% (162) of subjects in the apalutamide arm. The Applicant commits to 
providing updated PFS2 data on an annual basis (eg, June of 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022) 
Both time to symptomatic progression and OS can provide a good picture of the real benefit introducing 
apalutamide in the treatment of non-metastatic patients. Even though, both of them could indicate positive 
outcomes, there is an important drawback in the maturity of the data, even though and importantly no 
indication of detrimental effect on survival has been observed. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 104/139 
  
  
Results in terms of Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy can provide the clinical management of 
patients once they progress and a delay in initiation of chemotherapy can be considered of relevant from a 
patient´s point of view. Results showed a numerical trend towards superiority of apalutamide treatment, 
however data is also considered too immature (event rate 5.7% vs. 11% in apalutamide and placebo arms) and 
the boundary for statistical significance was not either crossed in this IA. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints, PSA response rate (proportion of subjects who achieved ≥50% decline in 
PSA value from baseline) and time to PSA progression, supported primary efficacy results. A confirmed PSA 
response rate was observed in 89.7% of patients in apalutamide arm vs. 2.2% in placebo arm.  The majority of 
patients (83.3%) in placebo arm had experienced PSA progression at the time of the analysis whereas only 
23.8% of patients in apalutamide arm had experienced such event. Median time to PSA progression was 3.71 
months in placebo arm whereas it was not reached in apalutamide arm. A clear and early separation of time to 
PSA curves can be observed. 
QoL analyses, even if they do not appear to show a detrimental effect, they are not stressing any improvement 
either. 
Finally, data on biomarkers is limited. An analysis of ARV7 a marker of resistance to AR therapies (RNA samples 
collected at end of first study treatment) was performed. Nine out of 96 (9.4%) subjects in the apalutamide arm 
and 13 out of 104 (12.5%) subjects in placebo arm expressed ARV7 at end of first treatment. Among the subset 
of subjects who had a PFS2 event, 3 out of 28 (10.7%) subjects in the apalutamide arm and 6 out of 36 (16.7%) 
subjects in the placebo arm were ARV7 positive. A formal statistical correlation was not performed as it would 
not be meaningful. However, PFS2 was observed to be marginally shorter for ARV7-positive subjects and with 
AR anomalies than ARV7-negative subjects (24.9 months to 28.5 months) or without AR anomalies (24.9 
months to 29.7 months). However, as the number of subjects expressing ARV7 or other AR anomalies and who 
had had a PFS2 event was low, the analysis should be considered as exploratory. The Applicant is recommended 
to submit a subgroup analysis from the SPARTAN study, comparing MFS and PFS2 between subjects expressing 
AR anomalies versus those without AR anomalies.  
Despite results from the SPARTAN trial have shown an unequivocal and clinically relevant effect in terms of delay 
of appearance of metastases or death compared to placebo, it still needs to be clarified to what extent these 
findings have an impact on long-term survival of patients. OS data is still immature so as to draw any firm 
conclusion and the immaturity of data regarding other potentially relevant secondary endpoints such as time to 
symptomatic progression or time to initiation of cytotoxic therapy precludes from drawing any firm conclusion. 
Importantly, the observed effect in the overall composite endpoint of time to symptomatic progression is not 
clear enough when the result is split into the different types of events. 
Beyond the individual patient perspective, which is undoubtedly important, survival increase has not been 
shown yet in the new setting of M0 CRPC, although no detrimental effect has been observed. The clinical value 
of this strategy, i.e. moving forward a hormonal therapy similar to those already authorized in first-line of 
metastatic setting, is not totally known, even though PFS2 data seem to offer some insights. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The use of apalutamide seems to offer an important delay in the onset of metastases, which for the time being 
appears to be supported by important secondary endpoints such as PFS2. To date, the immature OS data have 
not shown a detrimental effect, which reaffirms the clinical benefit or apalutamide in this setting. Thus, the 
efficacy is considered sufficiently demonstrated. Updated data are warranted in order to further substantiate the 
benefit of this treatment.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Erleada, the MAH should submit the final clinical study report, 
including overall survival results, from study ARN-509-003 (SPARTAN) comparing the efficacy and safety of 
Apalutamide vs. placebo in subjects with high risk Non-Metastatic (M0) Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of 240 mg of apalutamide plus ADT in the treatment of men with NM-CRPC is supported primarily by 
data from Study ARN-509-003, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
apalutamide or placebo with ADT background therapy in 1,201 treated subjects (apalutamide arm: 803 
subjects; placebo arm: 398 subjects). Safety data from the pivotal Phase 3 Study ARN-509-003 were integrated 
with safety data from subjects who received 240 mg of apalutamide in 2 smaller studies which included both 
NM-CRPC and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) subjects (Phase 1/2 Study ARN-509-001 [100 subjects] and Phase 1b 
Study 56021927PCR1019 [45 subjects]).

Adverse events of grade 3 or 4 
Hypertension and skin rash were the most frequently reported Grade 3 AEs in Study ARN-509-003 (≥3% of 
subjects in either of the treatment arms). No individual Grade 4 AE was reported for ≥1% of subjects in either 
ARN-509-003 treatment arm, or in the combined apalutamide group. 
Skin rash was reported as a Grade 3 event for 42 subjects (5.2%) in the apalutamide arm and for 1 subject 
(0.3%) in the placebo arm (combined apalutamide group: 46 subjects [4.9%]). No Grade 3 events were 
reported for the AEs of special interest of seizure and hypothyroidism; Grade 3 events of fall and fracture were 
each reported for <3% of subjects in either ARN-509-003 treatment arm. No individual Grade 4 AE was reported 
for ≥1% of subjects in either ARN-509-003 treatment arm, or in the combined apalutamide group.

-  Skin rash 
Most events were of Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 events were reported for 5.2% of apalutamide-treated patients and 
0.3% of placebo-treated patients. There were no reported events of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in the safety population.

- 
Fall 
 Most falls were Grade 1-2. Falls that require hospitalization (Grade 3) were reported for 14 subjects (1.7%) in 
the apalutamide arm and 3 subjects (0.8%) in the placebo arm. Events of fall led to drug interruption for 3 
apalutamide-treated subjects (0.4%) and for 0 placebo-treated subjects. No event of fall led to dose reduction. 
One subject (0.1%) in the ARN-509-003 apalutamide arm had an event of fall which led to discontinuation of 
study drug. 
- 
Fracture 
Exposure-standardized rates (events of fracture per 100 P-Y) for Study ARN-509-003 were 10.5 in the 
apalutamide arm and 7.8 in the placebo arm. For the combined apalutamide group, the exposure-standardized 
rate (events of fracture per 100 P-Y) was 9.9. 
Most events of fracture were Grade 1 or 2. A Grade 3 event of fracture was reported for 22 apalutamide-treated 
subjects (2.7%) and 3 placebo-treated subjects (0.8%) in Study ARN-509-003. No Grade 4 event of fracture 
was reported in any of the 3 studies. Events of fracture led to drug interruption for 6 apalutamide-treated 
subjects (0.7%) and for 3 placebo-treated subjects (0.8%) in Study ARN-509-003, and for 8 subjects (0.8%) in 
the combined apalutamide group (the 2 additional subjects were from Study ARN-509-001).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018

No event of fracture led to dose reduction. One subject (0.1%) in the ARN-509-003 apalutamide arm had an 
event of fracture (rib) which led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Fractures were often preceded by fall. Subjects who had an event of fracture reported a fall within 0-7 days prior 
in the apalutamide (40%) and placebo (50%) arms 
-  Seizure 
Two subjects had an event of seizure, both in the apalutamide arm of Study ARN-509-003. One of the events 
(Grade 2) was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. The other event (Grade 1) was 
considered to be secondary to Grade 3 fall. Both events of seizure were reported as SAEs. Neither event of 
seizure had an outcome of death. As mandated by the study protocol, both events of seizure led to 
discontinuation of study drug. 
-  Hypothyroidism 
Elevation of TSH generally occurred early during treatment, with the median time to first increased TSH being 
113 days. Exposure-standardized rates (events per 100 P-Y) were 7.6 in the apalutamide arm and 2.2 in the 
placebo arm. 
Only Grade 1 and 2 events of hypothyroidism were reported; no Grade 3 or 4 events of hypothyroidism were 
reported in any of the 3 studies. No event of hypothyroidism led to drug interruption. Events of hypothyroidism 
led to dose reduction for 1 apalutamide-treated subject (0.1%) in Study ARN-509-003. One subject (0.1%) in 
the ARN-509-003 apalutamide arm had an event of hypothyroidism which led to discontinuation of study drug.  
AEs associated with hypothyroidism were reported more frequently among those subjects who were receiving 
thyroid replacement therapy at study entry. At study entry, 3.1% of subjects in the apalutamide arm and 4.3% 
of subjects in the placebo arm were receiving thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine. Fifty-eight of 778 
subjects (7.5%) in the apalutamide arm who were not on thyroid replacement therapy at study entry had a 
hypothyroidism AE on study, compared to 7 of 25 subjects (28%) who were on thyroid replacement therapy at 
study entry. As TSH is monitored at regular intervals for all subjects on study treatment, and given the 
prevalence of hypothyroidism in the elderly population, 7 of 381 subjects (1.8%) in the placebo arm who were 
not on thyroid replacement therapy at study entry, compared to 1 of 17 subjects (5.9%) who were on thyroid 
replacement therapy at study entry, also had a hypothyroidism AE. Replacement therapy was started in 5.7% of 
apalutamide-treated patients during the study period (0.8% placebo), and an increased dose was required for 
14 subjects (56%) of those already receiving such therapy at study entry (2 subjects [12%] in the placebo 
group).

Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
The PK of apalutamide in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment was evaluated using a population PK 
approach, and had no discernible impact on the PK parameters. Consequently, dose adjustment in patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment is not warranted. 
Hepatic impairment 
Results from the hepatic impairment study (Study 56021927PCR1018) showed that exposures to 
Apalutamide were not meaningfully affected by mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). 
Hence, no dosage adjustment was deemed necessary for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No 
data are available for subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).

Adverse events by baseline ECOG performance status 
Of the 948 subjects in the combined apalutamide group, 721 subjects (76%) had an ECOG score 
of 0 and 227 subjects (24%) had an ECOG score of 1. The rates of Grade 3-4 AEs (ECOG 1: 
51%; ECOG 0: 42%), SAEs (ECOG 1: 32%; ECOG 0: 23%), and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (ECOG 
1: 16%; ECOG 0: 8.9%) were higher in subjects with an ECOG score of 
1 compared to subjects with an ECOG score of 0. 
Adverse events by number of prior hormonal therapies 
Of the 943 subjects in the combined apalutamide group for whom prior hormonal therapy information was 
available, 176 subjects (19%) received 1 prior hormonal therapy and 767 subjects (81%) received 2 or more 
prior hormonal therapies. In general, the overall rates of AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were similar for the 1 and ≥2 prior hormonal therapy groups. 
Adverse events by baseline PSADT 
Baseline PSADT was collected in Studies ARN-509-003 and ARN-509-001. Of the 847 subjects in the combined 
apalutamide group for whom a baseline PSADT value was available, 235 subjects (28%) had a PSADT >6 
months and 612 subjects (72%) had a PSADT ≤6 months. In general, the overall rates of AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, 
CHMP assessment report

SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were similar for the PSADT >6 months and PSADT ≤6 
months groups. 
Adverse events by bone-sparing agent use at baseline 
In the combined apalutamide group, only 14% of subjects were using bone-sparing agents at baseline. The 
relationship between bone-sparing agent use prior to study entry and events in the grouped term of fracture is 
discussed in the AE of special interest section. 
Extrinsic factors (AEs by geographic region) 
In the combined apalutamide group, 42% subjects were from North America, 45% from Europe, and 13% from 
the Rest of  the World. The overall rates of AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were similar for subjects from North America, Europe, and Rest of World. Subjects from Europe 
had lower rates of AEs overall and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation as compared with the other 
geographic region groups. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
The percentage of subjects reported with TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in the 
apalutamide arm (11%) compared with the placebo arm (7.0%), with TEAEs in the SOC of Skin and 
Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders resulting in the highest incidence of treatment discontinuations. 
Skin rash was the most common reason for treatment discontinuation in Study ARN-509-003: 19 subjects 
(2.4%) in the apalutamide arm and 0 subjects in the placebo arm. Two subjects enrolled to Study ARN-509-001 
discontinued apalutamide therapy due to events of skin rash. 
Fatigue was the next most common TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation (1.0% apalutamide versus 0.3% 
placebo). All other TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred at a low percentage (<1%).  
Adverse events leading to dose interruption, reduction, or other modifications 
TEAES leading to dose reduction were reported for 9.6% of subjects in the apalutamide arm and 1.8% of 
subjects in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to dose reduction (reported for >1% 
of subjects in either arm) were skin rash as the grouped term (2.7% apalutamide versus 0.3% placebo) and 
fatigue (1.7% apalutamide versus 0% placebo). 
TEAEs leading to dose interruption were reported for 30% of subjects in the apalutamide arm and 18% of 
subjects in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to interruption of treatment (reported 
for >1% of subjects in either arm) were skin rash as the grouped term (6.8% apalutamide vs.1.3% placebo), 
diarrhoea (2.4% apalutamide vs. 1.3% placebo),nausea (1.5% apalutamide vs. 1.0% placebo), vomiting (1.1% 
apalutamide vs. 1.0% placebo), fatigue (2.2% apalutamide vs. 0.5% placebo), urinary tract infection (0.5 
apalutamide vs. 1.3% placebo), hematuria (1.1% apalutamide vs. 0.5% placebo), and hypertension (1.2% 
apalutamide vs. 0.8% placebo).

Post marketing experience 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The assessment of the safety profile of apalutamide in the proposed indication is based mainly on the results of 
the phase III study ARN-509-003, which encompassed 1,201 patients with NM-CRPC that were randomized to 
receive apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [n=803] or placebo plus ADT [n=398]. 
Additionally, data on other 145 patients from studies ARN-509-001 (n=100), a phase1/2 study and study 
56021927PCR1019 (n=45), a phase 1b study, have been presented. Studies ARN-509-001 and 
56021927PCR1019 included patients with both NM-CRPC and mCRPC. Apalutamide was administered at a dose 
of 240 mg once daily. 
Exposure to apalutamide could be considered sufficient to the assessment of the safety profile. Median exposure 
to apalutamide was longer than to placebo (16.92 months [range: 0.1; 42.0] vs. 11.17 months [0.1; 37.1], 
respectively), with 70% and 26% of patients receiving apalutamide for ≥12 months and ≥24 months, 
respectively (45% and 11% with placebo). As of the data cut-off (19 May 2017), 61% of patients in the 
apalutamide arm and 30% of placebo-treated patients were still on treatment. Treatment compliance of at least 
95% was reported for approximately 48% of patients in the apalutamide arm compared to 67% of patients in 
the placebo arm.  
Overall treatment discontinuations were more common in the placebo arm compared to apalutamide arm 
(70.1% vs. 39.1%, respectively), mostly due to progressive disease (52.8% placebo vs. 19.3% apalutamide). 
Dose reductions (21% apalutamide vs. 15% placebo) and dose interruptions (77% apalutamide vs. 67% 
placebo) were more frequent with apalutamide. Differences were mainly driven by dose modifications related to 
AEs. Additionally, there were dose interruptions (43.1% apalutamide vs 47.2% placebo) and dose reductions 
(9.7% vs 11.3%) due to “other” reason. According to the applicant, the majority of them (approximately 99% 
and 75%, repectively) were due to the subject inadvertenly missing or forgotting to take 1 or more doses of 
apalutamide or placebo.   
Common adverse events 
Overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar between treatment arms (96.5% apalutamide vs. 93.2% 
placebo). However, the proportion of treatment-related AEs was higher in the apalutamide arm (70.4% vs. 
54.3%). The most commonly reported AEs that remained higher in the apalutamide arm when adjusted for 
exposure (events per 100 patients-year) were fatigue (32.3% vs. 27.2%), arthralgia (14.7% vs. 8.0%) and 
weight decreased (18.3% vs. 10.5%). Other less common AEs included rash (12.0% vs. 4.6%), pruritus (5.6% 
vs. 1.5%), hypercholesterolemia (4.6% vs. 1.7%) and hypertriglyceridemia (3.4% vs. 1.0%). 
Proportion of hypertension was significantly higher in the pivotal trial (24.8%) compared to phase I and Ib trials 
(8% and 2.2%). The proportion of subjects with hypertension reported as a TEAE in the Phase 3 randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial was nearly similar in the apalutamide and placebo arms; therefore, the PT of 
hypertension is not attributable to apalutamide exposure in Study ARN-509-003. The Phase 1 and Phase 1b 
studies were conducted at a different time and enrolled a different subject population; thus, it is not possible to 
compare the frequency of reporting of the PT of hypertension. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were more frequent with apalutamide than with placebo (45.1% vs. 34.2%). Grade 3-4 AEs 
occurring in ≥1% of apalutamide treated patients and with ≥0.5% higher incidence compared to placebo were 
hypertension (14.3% vs. 11.8%), pneumonia (1.1% vs. 0.8%), rash maculo-papular (1.9% vs. 0), rash (1.2% 
vs. 0.3%), syncope (2.1% vs. 1%), fall (1.7% vs. 0.8%), weight decreased (1.1% vs. 0.3%), hyperkalaemia 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 124/139 
  
  
(1% vs. 0.3%), hyperglycemia (1% vs. 0.5%) and diarrhea (1% vs. 0.5%). When adjusted for exposure, rash, 
syncope, fall and weight decreased remained higher in the apalutamide arm. Treatment-related grade 3-4 AEs 
were also more common in patients treated with apalutamide than with placebo (14.07% vs. 4.3%, 
respectively). Hypertension (2.1% apalutamide vs. 2.0% placebo) and skin-related events (5.4% apalutamide 
vs. 0 placebo) were the most commonly reported grade 3 related TEAEs (≥1%). No grade 4 drug-related TEAEs 
with a ≥1% frequency were reported.  
The applicant has provided an adequate statistical analysis of correlation between the time to discontinuation 
and timing and incidence of TEAEs. The applicant also submitted Kaplan-Meier plot for TEAES leading to 
treatment discontinuation and censored severe (grade 3-4) TEAES.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
The proportion of patients that reported SAEs was similar between treatment arms (25.4% apalutamide vs. 
23.4% placebo). Of these, 3.9% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 1.5% in the placebo arm reported SAEs 
that were considered by the investigator as related to study drug.  
SAEs most commonly reported (≥1%) in the apalutamide arm with a higher incidence compared to placebo were 
urinary tract infection (1.2% vs. 0.8%), pneumonia (1.1% vs. 0.5%), sepsis (1.0% vs. 0) and fracture grouped 
term (3.4% vs. 0.8%).

Deaths 
In study ARN-509-003 AEs leading to death occurred in 10 (1.2%) patients in the apalutamide arm (11 subjects 
in the combined apalutamide group). The majority of deaths were related to the SOC of cardiac disorders and 
infections and infestations (3 [0.4%], each). Only one of the deaths was considered by the investigator as 
related to study drug (a myocardial infarction in a patient who had prior history of myocardial infarction). 
Adverse events of special interest (AEOSIs) 
Adverse events considered of special interest with apalutamide include skin rash grouped term, fall, fracture, 
seizure and hypothyroidism.  
Skin rash (grouped term): skin rash was the most commonly reported AEOSI, with a higher incidence in the 
apalutamide arm for all (23.8% vs. 5.5%) and grade 3-4 events (5.2% vs 0.3%). Most events (81%) resolved 
with commonly used medications (median time to resolution: 59.5 days vs. 43 days, respectively). No events of 
toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) were reported.  
Fall: events of fall were reported with apalutamide in a higher rate than with placebo (16% vs. 9.0%, 
respectively) although when adjusted for treatment duration differences between treatment arms were reduced 
(13.6% vs. 10.0%). Fourteen (1.7%) patients in the apalutamide arm required hospitalization due to grade 3 
AEs of fall.  
Fracture: 94 (12%) patients in the apalutamide arm reported events of fracture compared to 26 (6.5%) patients 
in the placebo arm. The incidence of fracture appears to be related to treatment duration, being higher after one 
year of treatment. Grade 3 events were reported in 22 (2.7%) of patients in the apalutamide arm. 
Approximately 40% of events in the apalutamide arm were preceded by a previous fall. The mechanistic 
relationship between the increased risk of fall and fracture with the study drug is not completely understood. 
Further investigations to identify risk factors correlated with these adverse events and possible preventive 
measures are needed, especially in the context of long-term exposure to the drug. 
Seizure: two (0.2%) events of seizure were reported, both during study ARN-509-003. One of the events was 
considered to be related to study drug while the other occurred in the context of a trauma after a fall. In both 
cases, apalutamide treatment was discontinued, as per protocol.  
Regarding non clinical data, apalutamide has been associated with a potential for seizure, considering the 
inhibition of GABA A receptor as the mechanism for the seizure observed in non clinical studies. Convulsions 
have also been reported in clinical trials with enzalutamide, a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor. 
Nevertheless, neurologic events could be underestimated since patients with predisposing conditions or 
concomitant medications that could lower the seizure threshold were excluded.  
Hypothyroidism: In study ARN-509-003 hypothyroidism was reported in 65 (8.1%) patients in the apalutamide 
arm compared to 8 (2.0%) patients in the placebo arm. The incidence of hypothyroidism was higher in those 
patients who were receiving thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine at study entry (7/25 [28.0%] 
apalutamide vs. 1/17 [5.9%] placebo). Enzyme induction of UGT through induction for CYP3A4 is deemed to be 
the cause for this effect. Patients with an altered pituitary-thyroid axis, such as those with hypothirodism, would 
not be able to compensate alterations in thyroxine metabolism so adjustment of exogenous hormone 
administration may be required for those on thyroid replacement hormone.

Intrinsic factors 
Regarding age, no differences were observed in the overall incidence of AEs between groups. However grade 3-4 
AEs, SAEs and discontinuation due to AEs were more common in patients older than 75 years, mainly those AEs 
considered related to study drug.  
The majority of patients included in study ARN-509-003 had normal hepatic function (723 [90%]). Only 2 
patients had moderate hepatic impairment, thus safety data in this population are limited. However, according 
to a population PK approach and a pharmacokinetic single-dose study (n=24), exposure to apalutamide and its 
metabolite N-desmethyl apalutamide does not seem to be affected by mild or moderate hepatic impairment, 
therefore no major differences in the safety profile of apalutamide would be expected in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment. Apalutamide has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
The majority of patients included in the pivotal trial were white, while only 6.6% and 11% were black or Asian, 
respectively. Of note, grade 3-4 treatment-related AEs were more frequent in black (20.8%) and Asian (18.5%) 
patients compared to white patients (12.8%). Additionally, treatment-related SAEs and AEs related to study 
drug leading to discontinuation were also more commonly reported in black patients (10.4% and 16.7%, 
respectively) compared to Asian (5.4% and 9.8%) and white (3.4% and 5.9%) patients. Nevertheless, these 
differences canot be attributed to any PT in particular and taking into account the small sample size of the 
subgroup of Black patients (n=48) it is difficult to conclude that those differences could be related to 
apalutamide treatment. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
The most common hematologic laboratory abnormality observed in both treatment arms was anaemia (70.4% 
apalutamide vs. 63.5% placebo). The proportion of patients with lymphocyte count decreased was twice as high 
in patients treated with apalutamide compared to placebo (41.4% vs. 20.6%) as well as neutrophil count 
decreased (17.4% vs. 8.4%). Most cases were grade 1 or grade 2. The most frequently reported grade 3 
hematologic laboratory abnormality was lymphocyte count decrease. Decreasing in lymphocyte and neutrophil 
count occurs during the first cycles of treatment and then remain stable. 
Cholesterol high, hiperkalemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertriglyceridemia were more frequent in patients 
treated with apalutamide.  
ECG evaluations from Study ARN-509-003 and the dedicated QT/QTc Study 56021927PCR1019 showed no 
significant effect of apalutamide on ventricular repolarisation. However, further clarifications were requested. 
After reviewing, risk of potential QT prolongation in patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease 
cannot be fully ruled out. Thus, the feasibility to conduct a PASS to characterize the risks of use in the subgroup 
of population of patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease should be discussed by the applicant 
(see RMP). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been reflected in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, apalutamide appears to be well tolerated. Fatigue (30.4%), hypertension (24.8%), skin rash (23.8%) 
and diarrhoea (20.3%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. Other adverse events of special 
interest associated to apalutamide treatment were fracture (12%), fall (15.6%), seizure (0.2%) and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 127/139 
  
  
hypothyroidism (8.1%). Skin rash as a grouped term was the main adverse event related to treatment 
discontinuations and dose modifications. 
Since the new therapy is supposed to prevent metastases in patients without symptoms of the disease, an 
important issue is considered to be a good level of safety and tolerability of the drug. 
A relatively high proportion of grade 3 TEAEs were reported with apalutamide compared to placebo. Given that 
OS data are still immature, the impact of apalutamide on OS compared to placebo remains uncertain. In this 
context, impact of apalutamide treatment on QoL plays a crucial role, moreover considering the intended long 
term use of apalutamide. However, QoL analyses do not appear to show a detrimental effect. 
All in all, the safety profile of apalutamide is considered acceptable and sufficiently characterised.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14-02-18. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of apalutamide with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers apalutamide to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the immediate labelling has been submitted by the applicant and has 
been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The product will be marketed as film-coated tablets supplied in blisters sealed in a wallet card. The company 
requested to omit printing certain of the minimum particulars on the blister foil as patients will not be able to see 
it since it will be completely sealed in an inner wallet. The inner wallet will contain all the required minimum 
particulars for the primary packaging and will be translated in all languages. 
The QRD Group agreed to print the minimum particulars on the blister foil as follows: invented name, INN, 
strength, EXP/Lot. The only particulars that would need translation on the blister foil are the INN, EXP and Lot, 
and the QRD Group agreed to have these particulars in English only.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be translated 
in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on the EMA website, but the printed materials will only 
be in English as agreed by the QRD Group.

2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Erleada (apalutamide) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Erleada is indicated for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (PSADT ≤10 months). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At the time of this MAA, there were no approved treatments for patients with NM-CRPC. Patients with NM-CRPC 
are largely asymptomatic so the burden of long-term toxicities and the potential for negative impact on quality 
of life are major considerations in the selection of therapy. First-generation antiandrogens (bicalutamide, 
nilutamide, flutamide), ketoconazole, estrogens, and corticosteroids administered in combination with ADT have 
been used in the NM-CRPC setting, with no durability of response. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy data in support of this application focus on data from trial ARN-509-003 (SPARTAN): A Multicenter, 
Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Study of Apalutamide compared with placebo in a total 
of 1207 subjects (2:1) with high risk Non-Metastatic (M0) Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer who had rapidly 
rising PSA (PSA doubling time ≤10 months). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from SPARTAN trial in the efficacy target population of patients at the cut-off date of 19 May 2017 
included the main analysis planned for MFS (BIRC assessed) and the first interim analysis for OS (2 IA planned 
plus 1 final analysis). 
With an event rate of 25.9% and 52.4% for apalutamide and placebo arms respectively, a statistically significant 
improvement in MFS was observed in favour of apalutamide (HR: 0.297; 95% CI: 0.244, 0.362). The median 
MFS (95% CI) was 40.51 months (95% CI: NE, NE) in the apalutamide group and 15.70 months (95% CI: 
14.55, NE) in the placebo group (Δ 24.81 months). These results are supported by several sensitivity analyses 
as well as by subgroups analyses. 
Most secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. Treatment with apalutamide 
delayed time to Time to metastasis (HR: 0.271; 95% CI: 0.219, 0.335) and PFS (HR:0.291; 95% CI: 
0.238,0.356) however these endpoints are closely related to the primary endpoint by definition.  
A statistically significant effect was demonstrated for time to symptomatic progression (HR: 0.447; 95%CI: 
0.315, 0.634), however the number of events is limited (event rate of 7.9% in apalutamide arm and 15.7% in 
placebo arm).  
OS data, still highly immature at the time of the first IA so as to draw any firm conclusion (event rate 7.7% and 
10.5% in apalutamide and placebo arms respectively), did not cross the boundary for statistical significance 
(HR=0.700, 95% CI: 0.472, 1.038) and although an initial separation of the survival curves is observed, no firm 
conclusion can be drawn.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 134/139 
  
  
PFS2 data (as of the 17 May 2018), with 20.1% and 29.9% of events in apalutamide and placebo arms, showed 
an initial trend towards greater reduction of risk of disease progression with next line therapy or death for 
patients initially allocated to apalutamide arm compared to placebo (HR: 0.449, 95% CI: 0.393, 0.632). 
Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy did not ether show a statistically significant effect, however a trend towards 
superiority is observed in favour of apalutamide (HR=0.435, 95% CI: 0.286, 0.661). 
Patient-reported outcome results seem to indicate maintenance of overall health related quality of life with the 
addition of apalutamide to ADT in this population of generally asymptomatic NM-CRPC subjects. Similar mean 
changes from baseline or median time to worsening in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Prostate 
(FACT-P) were observed in the 2 treatment arms. For nearly all time points, no differences between apalutamide 
and placebo were observed in change from baseline across the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main uncertainty of the present application is related to the use of a new variable (MFS) in a setting where 
no treatment is established. Despite a clear statistically significant reduction in terms of MFS was demonstrated 
in the pivotal trial, in the absence of more mature OS data it seems difficult to conclude about the long term 
relevance of such finding. 
Despite time to symptomatic progression showing a statistically significant effect, which could be relevant when 
it comes to assessing the benefit of apalutamide treatment, the data are relatively immature. 
Updated efficacy results are expected (PAES). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of apalutamide in the proposed indication is based mainly on the results of the phase III study 
ARN-509-003 (which encompassed 1,201 patients with NM-CRPC thatOv were randomized to receive 
apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [n=803] or placebo plus ADT [n=398]) and data on other 
145 patients from studies ARN-509-001 (a phase1/2 study; n=100) and study 56021927PCR1019 (a phase 1b 
study; n=45), in which apalutamide was administered at a dose of 240 mg once a day. Studies ARN-509-001 
and 56021927PCR1019 included patients with both NM-CRPC and mCRPC.  
Median exposure to apalutamide in study ARN-509-003 was 16.92 months [range: 0.1; 42.0] (compared to 
11.17 months [range: 0.1; 37.1] with placebo), with 70% and 26% of patients receiving apalutamide for ≥12 
months and ≥24 months, respectively (45% and 11% with placebo).  
In the study ARN-509-003 the most commonly reported AEs (≥ 15%; by PT) were fatigue (30.4%), 
hypertension (24.8%), diarrhoea (20.3%), nausea (18.1%), weight decreased (16.1%), arthralgia (15.9%) 
and fall (15.6%).  
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 45.1% of patients, with 14.07% being considered related to study drug by the 
investigator. The most frequent grade 3-4 AEs were hypertension (14.3%), syncope (2.1%), rash 
maculo-papular (1.9) and fall (1.7%).  
SAEs were reported in 25.4% of patients (3.9% of them were considered by the investigator as related to study 
drug). SAEs most commonly reported (≥1%) in the apalutamide arm with a higher incidence compared to 
placebo were urinary tract infection (1.2%), pneumonia (1.1%), sepsis (1.0%) and fracture grouped term 
(3.4%). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/879617/2018 
Page 135/139 
  
  
In study ARN-509-003 AEs leading to death occurred in 10 (1.2%) patients in the apalutamide arm. The 
majority of deaths were related to the SOC of cardiac disorders and infections and infestations (3 [0.4%], each). 
Only one of the deaths was considered by the investigator as related to study drug (a myocardial infarction in a 
patient who had prior history of myocardial infarction). 
Skin rash grouped term, seizure, fall, fracture and hypothyroidism are adverse events of special interest 
associated to apalutamide treatment, reported in 42% of subjects. 
Skin rash was the most frequently reported apalutamide treatment related AE, although most of the events were 
Grade 1-2.  
In the study ARN-509-003, 10.7% of patients discontinued treatment with apalutamide (compared to 6.3% with 
placebo) due to AEs. Additionally, dose reductions and dose interruptions due to AEs were required in 11.2% of 
patients (3.3% placebo) and 33.6% of patients (19.3% placebo). Skin rash was the main AEs related to 
discontinuations, dose reductions and dose interruptions. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of apalutamide could be considered well characterised. There are no important 
uncertainties about unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Apalutamide after failure to ADT has shown a statistically significant difference (25-months increase in median 
times) in terms of MFS compared to placebo in a population of non-metastatic CRPC patients who had rapidly 
rising PSA. Results in terms of OS failed to show any statistically significant result and data are still immature so 
as to firmly conclude about the potential benefit in survival.  
The fact of treating patients with apalutamide in the proposed setting implies to delay the metastatic status. This 
is the main conclusion from the SPARTAN study. To what extent this strategy could add a benefit in OS is for the 
time being unknown. However, it should be noted that no indication of detrimental effect in OS has been shown.

Additionally, PFS2 results, even immature, are pointing out to a positive result. All in all, from an efficacy point 
of view, this new treatment represents a valuable option for patients and physicians, even though more mature 
data are needed. The safety profile of apalutamide could be considered sufficiently characterised. Overall, 
apalutamide was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results from Spartan trial are considered to demonstrate a statistically significant advantage in terms of MFS for 
patients with CRPC whereas the safety profile of apalutamide is considered acceptable. Overall, the effect shown 
in delaying the appearance of metastases overcomes the uncertainties related to lack of maturity of some 
variables. Therefore, the B/R is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The impact that early introduction of apalutamide treatment may have on cross-resistance development and 
effect on subsequent treatments is an uncertainty that should be considered in future development. 
In order to investigate the long term efficacy of apalutamide in patients with non-metastatic castration resistant 
prostate cancer (NM CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease, the MAH should submit the 
final results of the SPARTAN study Post Authorisation Efficacy study (PAES). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Erleada is positive.

3.  Scientific data provided by the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder 
3.1.  Introduction 
Reyataz (atazanavir; ATV) is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively 
inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus 
preventing formation of mature virions and infection of other cells. It is indicated for the treatment 
of HIV-1 infected adults in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. Based on 
available virological and clinical data, no benefit is expected in patients with strains resistant to 
multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations).  
Reyataz is currently approved as 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg capsules of atazanavir as 
well as a 50 mg/1.5 g oral powder (oral powder containing 1.5 g of powder per levelled measuring 
spoon, equivalent to 50 mg of atazanavir expressed as free base in a multidose HPDE bottle with a 
measuring spoon) for use in adults only. The oral powder has so far not been marketed in the EU.  
As of the end of 2007, an estimated 33.2 million people worldwide – 30.8 million adults and 
2.5 million children younger than 15 years – were living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 
370,000 children under the age of 15 became infected with HIV in 2007 (Source: UNAIDS). In 
western and central Europe, an estimated 740,000 persons were living with HIV in 2006. In 2005, 
27,555 new HIV diagnoses were reported by 26 European countries, of which 1% (275) were 
children < 15 years of age and 10% (2,755) were young people aged between 15 and 24 years. 
HIV-related mortality and opportunistic and other related infections have significantly decreased in 
HIV-infected children in the era of HAART. More specifically, since the introduction of NNRTI- or PI-
containing combinations, HIV mortality in children in resource-rich countries has decreased by 70%. 
However, off-label use of ARV drugs approved for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults only, in the 
absence of appropriate paediatric formulations and dose recommendations, is not uncommon. 
Consequently, there continues to be a need for effective and tolerable therapeutic agents for use in 
the paediatric population. 
The use of PIs has been a major breakthrough in the therapy for HIV-1 infection, substantially 
reducing morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. However, the long-term use of the 
currently licensed PIs is often hampered by different factors such as poor compliance due to a high 
pill burden and/or poor palatability of oral solutions, as well as food restrictions, side effects with 
impact on the quality of life and the emergence of resistant virus that is no longer inhibited by the 
medicine used.  
Atazanavir has pharmacokinetics that allow once daily dosing in adults, which makes a paediatric 
development program desirable as adherence could be expected to improve with such a regimen in 
this population.  
This type II variation sought an extension of the indication for Reyataz hard capsules to include 
HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products.

An extension application (EMEA/H/C/494/X/58) for the addition of a sachet presentation for the oral 
powder, where each sachet contains 1.5 g oral powder equivalent to 50 mg atazanavir free base, 
for use in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients from 3 months to <6 years of age weighing 5 to <25 
kg in combination with other medicinal products was submitted in parallel. However, the CHMP in 
its D120 List of Questions concluded that this line extension was not approvable since data obtained 
from study AI424020 were considered to be inadequate to support the dose recommendations for 
ATV/RTV according to body weight bands proposed by the MAH for the powder formulation. In 
particular, there were concerns that doses may be inadequate based on the virological response 
rates (at the < 50 c/ml level) observed in treatment-naïve and treatment–experienced children. 
This was especially critical in light of the fact that the PPK analysis performed by the MAH 
suggested that, when compared to adult patients, AUC and Cmax would be higher in this population 
whereas Ctrough would be lower (especially in children of lower weight, i.e. 5-10 kg). 
On 10 August 2009, the MAH informed the CHMP on his decision to withdraw the application for a 
unit-dose sachet for the Reyataz oral powder for children 3 months of age and older up to 25 kg in 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The reason for this withdrawal was that the CHMP concern raised 
in relation to a valid dose recommendation for younger children (major objection) could not be 
adequately addressed by the dataset currently available. The MAH, nevertheless, assured the 
Committee that the withdrawal will have no impact on ongoing paediatric clinical trials involving 
Reyataz. In addition, no compassionate use programme for Reyataz oral powder in sachet is 
affected by this withdrawal. The MAH confirmed that he would further investigate and collect data 
with the use of Reyataz oral powder for children between 3 months to 6 years of age and that a PIP 
would be submitted to the PDCO for agreement. 
Therefore, even though the MAH is still encouraged to adequately develop the medicinal product in 
children younger than 6 years of age to answer a medical need, the MAH’s current choice to only 
maintain the application in children above the age of 6 within this current extension of indication for 
Reyataz capsules was supported by the CHMP. 
One single clinical study (AI424020 also referenced to as PACTG 1020-A), as well as one PKK 
modelling analysis were submitted in support of this variation. This study includes data on the 
powder and therefore on the younger children. These data are being discussed, where necessary, in 
this report even though they are not limited to the population and pharmaceutical form, for which 
an indication is sought.   
Atazanavir is authorised in the EU only with the concomitant use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic 
enhancer (“boosting”). In line with the adult MA, the MAH is not seeking an indication for 
unboosted atazanavir in the paediatric population (either using the powder in sachets or the hard 
capsules). However, data for unboosted atazanavir were obtained during the clinical study and 
some are included in this report for completeness. 
The MAH initially proposed the following changes to section 4.1 and 4.2 of the SPC, in addition to 
changes in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 (deletions are indicated by strikethrough, additions are 
indicated by underlined): 
3.1.1.  Therapeutic indications 
Reyataz capsules are indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and paediatric patients 6 
years of age and older in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/356437/2010  
Page 4/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In antiretroviral treatment experienced adult patients, the demonstration of efficacy is based on a 
study comparing REYATAZ 300 mg once daily in combination with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with 
lopinavir/ritonavir, each regimen in combination with tenofovir. Based on available virological and 
clinical data, no benefit is expected in patients with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors 
(≥ 4 PI mutations). The choice of REYATAZ in treatment experienced patients should be based on 
individual viral resistance testing and the patient’s treatment history.  
3.1.2.  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Adults: the recommended dose of REYATAZ is 300 mg once daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg once 
daily and with food. Ritonavir is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics. 
Paediatric Patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age): The dose of REYATAZ capsules for 
paediatric patients is based on body weight as shown in Table 1 and should not exceed the 
recommended adult dose. REYATAZ capsules must be taken with food. 
REYATAZ oral powder is available for paediatric patients from 3 months of age and older up to 
25 kg. (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ oral powder). For paediatric patients 
who have reached 6 years of age, switching to REYATAZ capsules is encouraged as soon as they 
are able to swallow capsules. 
Paediatric Patients (less than 3 months of age): REYATAZ has not been studied in children less than 
3 months of age and is not recommended because of the potential risk of kernicterus.

recommended that didanosine be taken 2 hours after REYATAZ with ritonavir. REYATAZ with 
ritonavir must be taken with food . 
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is needed . 
Patients with hepatic impairment: REYATAZ with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with 
hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment. REYATAZ should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment.  
Method of administration: for oral administration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. 
3.2.  Non clinical aspects 
Environmental Risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Tier B Assessment has been conducted for the initial Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA). It is agreed that Reyataz is unlikely to pose any risks to the environment.

Toxicology 
The decision to initiate a study of ATV in children was based on non-clinical findings that showed 
that ATV produces no selective developmental toxicity and no effects on reproductive function or 
fertility at exposures generally equivalent to those observed in both adult and paediatric patients. 
This was confirmed in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies previously conducted 
with ATV. These studies showed that ATV had no effect on growth, development, and reproductive 
performance of progeny in rats. In addition ATV had no effect on fertility, reproductive performance, 
gestation, parturition, and lactation of the parental generation in rats; or on embryonic and foetal 
development in rats and rabbits.  
These non-clinical findings were shown in the current clinical study (PACTG 1020-A), which studied 
the safety and efficacy of ATV or ATV/RTV in 183 paediatric patients for at least up to 48 weeks, 
and which identified no new safety signals and which found that the overall safety in paediatric 
patients was comparable to that in adults.  
Overall post-marketing authorisation non-clinical toxicity was also recently reviewed in the non-
clinical overview in the 5-year Renewal (August 2008). In addition, the MAH will conduct post-
marketing surveillance in Europe to collect additional safety information on HIV-infected children 
exposed to atazanavir in real-life settings. 
Therefore, the MAH proposed that the existing clinical data in paediatric patients, the commitment 
to conduct additional post-marketing surveillance in paediatric patients and the existing non-clinical 
toxicity data support the proposed paediatric indication and that the use of animals to conduct 
additional non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies is not warranted. 
Discussion on Toxicology 
The MAH considered additional juvenile toxicity studies as not necessary, based mainly on the 
review of reproduction toxicity studies. No adverse effect on fertility was noted in rats in spite of 
altered oestrous cycling in female, no teratogenic effect was reported in either rats or rabbits, and 
offspring development was not significantly affected in the pre-post-natal toxicity study. However, 
the justification for lack of juvenile toxicity is mainly based on the review of reproduction toxicity 
studies, which is questionable; it is unclear whether the trans-placental or milk transfer was enough 
to achieve a systemic exposure in foetuses and pups that could provide a safety margin for the 
main toxicological findings in adults.  
In addition, it should be mentioned that the main target organ in repeat-dose toxicity (rats and 
dogs) was the liver. Potential differences in PK due to different transporter, cytochrome, and 
clearance activities that could be expected in juvenile animals and/or children have not been 
discussed either. Besides, the MAH has not provided a discussion of the reduced safety margins for 
the Cmax-dependent toxicological findings taking into account that the Cmax in children is higher 
than that in adults. 
However, clinical experience exists in both adults and children. For all the above mentioned reasons, 
it is considered that the preclinical data have limited value to support the proposed indication. It is 
also noted that no major system known to develop significantly during childhood, e.g. CNS, 
reproductive system, skeletal system, was identified as target organ in toxicity studies. Overall, the 
safety of Reyataz in children should be based on the clinical observations; therefore, the lack of 
specific toxicity studies in juvenile animals is considered acceptable.

3.3.  Clinical aspects 
Clinical Pharmacology 
Population Pharmacokinetic (PPK) studies  
The dataset used for the PPK modelling was pooled from three adult studies and one paediatric 
study. The PPK analysis was performed with 3939 atazanavir concentration values from 227 HIV-
infected adult and paediatric subjects (732 and 3207 concentration values from 60 and 167 adult 
and paediatric subjects, respectively) who participated in the following 4 clinical studies: 3 adult 
studies (AI424008, AI424089, and AI424137), and 1 paediatric study (AI424020), which is 
discussed in detail in the section on clinical efficacy and safety further below. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of atazanavir has been evaluated previously in healthy and HIV infected 
subjects. Atazanavir demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics with greater than dose-proportional 
increases in AUC and Cmax values over the dose range of 200-800 mg once daily. Atazanavir has 
PK parameters that support once-daily dosing. The mean elimination half-life of atazanavir in 
healthy and HIV-infected subjects was approximately 7 hours at steady state following a dose of 
400 mg daily. Steady-state is achieved between Days 4 and 8, with an accumulation of 
approximately 2.3-fold. For this reason, only steady-state data were used in the analysis of PPK 
and dose was tested as a covariate on one or more of the PK parameters of the linear PK model to 
account for potential dose-dependent kinetics.  
Population PK studies AI424008, AI424089, AI424137 conducted in adults characterised the steady 
state PK data of atazanavir in HIV infected adult subjects using a PPK modelling approach to 
determine body weight (BWT)-based paediatric doses for the powder and capsule formulations of 
boosted (in combination with low-dose ritonavir) and unboosted atazanavir. A nonlinear mixed-
effects compartmental PPK model was developed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of 
atazanavir and to investigate the covariate effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on atazanavir PK 
parameters. Paediatric doses that produced exposures similar to those used to treat HIV-infected 
adults were determined by employing a model-based simulation approach. Similarity of paediatric 
atazanavir exposures following unboosted atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir dosing regimens with 
the corresponding target adult exposures was determined.  
The predictive performance of the final PPK model was evaluated by simulated data using the final 
model parameter estimates and conducting a posterior predictive check (PPC). The final model 
parameter estimates (θ, Ω, Σ) were assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution with mean 
vector set to the population parameter estimates and covariance matrix set to the covariance 
matrix of the estimates. The multivariate normal distribution was used as an approximate 
asymptotic posterior distribution to generate 1000 sets of population parameter values. These 
population parameters values were then used to generate 1000 simulated datasets conditioning on 
the designs, dose regimens and covariates in the observed dataset.  
For each simulated dataset as well as the observed dataset, the non-compartmental estimates 
(means and standard deviations) of C24, AUC (steady state area under concentration-time curve at 
time 0 to 24 hr), and Cmax were calculated and used as PPC statistics.  For each PPC statistic, the 
observed statistic was compared to selected percentiles (5th, median, 95th) of the 1000 simulated 
statistics.  Plots of these statistics were stratified by the 8 age groupings as defined in the 
paediatric study (Study AI424020) along with 2 additional groupings for the adult patients receiving 
label recommended atazanavir alone or in combination with ritonavir.

Model-based simulations were performed to support paediatric dosing recommendations based on a 
bridging strategy, by determining paediatric doses that resulted in steady-state exposures (C24, 
Cmax, and AUC) similar to target exposures achieved in HIV-infected adults receiving 400 mg QD 
atazanavir or 300 mg QD atazanavir + 100 mg QD ritonavir. The following decision tree was used 
to establish similarity of paediatric and adult exposures for the ritonavir boosted atazanavir 
regimen (Figure 1):

Where GM is the geometric mean; C24,adult, Cmax,adult, and AUC adult are the target ATV C24, Cmax, and 
AUC distributions in adults, determined by model-based simulation of ATV/RTV doses of 300/100 mg (based on 
the currently recommended adult dose for antiviral-treatment naïve patients); PER is the percentage of subjects 
attaining exposures (C24, Cmax and AUC) within 10th and 90th percentiles of the target adult exposures 
Based on the PK/PD analyses from studies AI424089 and AI424138 performed in ARV-naïve 
patients, the C24 GM level of ≥ 500 ng/ml (75% adult C24 GM) is predicted to be able to achieve 
good antiviral efficacy for RTV boosted ATV (300/100mg). This prediction is consistent with the 
clinical results in the AI424020 study in which 88% of ARV naïve paediatric patients treated with 
the ATV/RTV capsule formulation achieved < 400 c/ml, despite the fact that >40% of the patients 
took lower than proposed ATV doses in this dose-finding study. 
The following covariate effects were included in the final model: an age effect on Ka (the first-order 
absorption rate constant), body weight effects on V/F (apparent volume of distribution) and CL/F 
(apparent clearance), ritonavir co-medication effects on CL/F and Frel (relative bioavailability), and 
a formulation effect on Frel. These covariate effects were important determinants informing the 
BWT-based dose recommendations for paediatric patients receiving atazanavir capsules or powder 
formulation alone or in combination with ritonavir. While the atazanavir exposure similarity criteria 
as defined were dependent on whether patients are ARV-treatment naïve or experienced, the 
covariate parameter for this effect was neither influential nor included in the final model. Therefore, 
the final PPK model does not predict differences in atazanavir exposures between ARV-treatment 
naïve and experienced patients receiving a given dosing regimen.

The PPK analysis dataset included all available PK data from the 3 clinical studies in adult HIV-
infected subjects and all intensive PK data from study AI424020 that were available as of 2-March-
2007. The PPK dataset used for model development excluded approximately 7% of the available 
atazanavir concentrations determined by the FDA due to issues with bioanalytical analyses. The 
dataset used was compared to the dataset including the 7% results questioned by the FDA. The 
MAH stated that the exclusion of the FDA-identified data does not appear to be influential on the 
parameter estimation. 
Dose-Normalised Observed Cmax vs. Age at Week 1 for Paediatric Patients in Study 
AI424020 
While body weight, ritonavir co-medication and formulation were important factors affecting the 
overall extent of atazanavir exposure (e.g. AUC), the age effect was an important determinant for 
ka with increasing ka in younger patients. This effect translated into a higher Cmax with decreasing 
age as can be observed in the figure below. Note that Cmax sharply increased for paediatric 
patients less than 10 years of age.  
Figure 2: 
Dose-Normalized Observed Cmax vs. Age at Week 1 for Paediatric Patients 
in Study AI424020 
The final model predicted that younger children and infants have an increased apparent rate of 
atazanavir absorption resulting in a higher Cmax as compared to adolescents and adults. The 
model also predicted increases in V/F and CL/F with increasing body weight as one would expect in 
a pooled analysis across such a wide range of body weights (4.5 kg - 121 kg). The ritonavir co-
medication effects on CL/F and relative bioavailability predict substantially higher atazanavir 
exposures for patients receiving atazanavir in combination with ritonavir as compared to atazanavir 
alone which is consistent with previous reports of the drug-drug interaction effect between 
atazanavir and ritonavir. Finally, the model predicts an approximate 35.5% reduction in 
bioavailability for the powder formulation relative to capsules. 
The final model included ritonavir co-medication effects parameterised as simple dichotomous 
effects (presence or absence) and did not take into consideration of the actual dose of ritonavir. No 
apparent ritonavir dose trends were observed for the C0 and Frel parameters, while an apparent 
CHMP variation assessment report

Page 9/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trend between ritonavir dose and CL/F was observed. Since the ritonavir dose administered was 
based on body surface area (BSA) and there is a body weight effect on CL/F, it was unclear if the 
apparent ritonavir dose trend observed could be fully explained by the correlation between ritonavir 
dose and body weight or whether the ritonavir dose explains additional variation in CL/F that is not 
explained by body weight. 
In further investigations the ritonavir dose as administered in the paediatric study did not appear to 
explain additional variation in atazanavir exposure beyond the simple dichotomous effect. The 
ritonavir dose recommendations (80 mg for ritonavir liquid formulation and 100 mg for ritonavir 
capsule formulation) were chosen on the basis of the clinical judgment consistent with the 
atazanavir/ritonavir dose ratios studied in the paediatric study AI424020.

Conclusion by the MAH 
•  Steady-state atazanavir concentration-time profiles in adult and paediatric HIV-infected 
populations were adequately described by a C0-delinked one-compartment model with first-
order absorption. 
• 
• 
The following covariates were found to have an effect on atazanavir PK parameters: age, body 
weight, ritonavir co-medication, and formulation. Atazanavir CL/F and V/F increase with body 
weight, and CL/F is 40.9% lower in patients receiving ritonavir co-medication. The relative 
bioavailability (Frel) of atazanavir increases with ritonavir co-medication, and was 35.5% lower 
for the atazanavir powder formulation relative to the capsule formulation. 
The final PPK model does not predict differences in atazanavir exposures between ARV-
treatment naïve and experienced patients receiving a given dosing regimen. 
•  Body weight-based powder and capsule atazanavir doses were determined for HIV-infected 
paediatric patients weighing more than 10 kg, such that the exposures following these doses 
were comparable to those of atazanavir capsule doses used to treat HIV-infected adults 
Discussion on PPK model  
This report summarises a standard modelling and simulation approach based on PKK from 3 adult 
and 1 paediatric study aiming to predict paediatric doses that would produce exposures similar to 
those used to treat HIV-infected adults with atazanavir. The exposure targets in adults were 
determined by a model- based simulation of an atazanavir dose of 400mg for atazanavir alone and 
300mg/100mg for atazanavir/ritonavir combined. 
The exposure similarity criteria were that the geometric mean (GM) for C24 should lie >75% of that 
in adults and PER for C24 >75%. The selected target for ATV Ctrough is expected to provide a

satisfactory rate of virologic suppression. However, the CHMP would like to underline that similarity 
criteria were based on results from studies performed in adult naïve patients. It remains unclear 
whether the selection of acceptance criteria would also be appropriate for the use of boosted ATV in 
paediatric experienced patients. However, in accordance with its therapeutic use in adults, Reyataz 
will be mainly used in the paediatric population for naïve patients or moderately experienced 
patients. 
In the simulations of the BWT-based dosing the variability is extensive with CV% >100% for C24. 
Model estimated and observed variability in ATV PK do indeed appear to be largely consistent, as 
demonstrated by the posterior predictive check (PPC) and visual predictive check (VPC) 
assessments. The PPC results indicate that the observed %CV tends to be large (>100%) across 
the study groups but are generally comparable to the model simulated median and are contained 
within the model simulated 5th - 95th interval. In general, it is concluded that the variability based 
on simulation is consistent with the variability of the observed data. 
Atazanavir without low dose ritonavir is not authorised for the treatment of HIV infected adults in 
the EU and the MAH does not seek authorisation for it in paediatric patients. Therefore the following 
discussion focuses on use of atazanavir/ritonavir. The model predicted that age, body weight, 
presence of ritonavir and atazanavir formulation were relevant factors affecting exposure to 
atazanavir with different dosing regimens. 
PK data showed a trend towards lower atazanavir Cmin but higher Cmax and AUC in children 
compared to adults. The effect was less pronounced when atazanavir was combined with low dose 
ritonavir. The doses proposed as a result of modelling and simulation for the capsule for most 
weight brackets appear similar to adult doses within the margin set.  
The ritonavir dose recommended for co-administration with atazanavir was not optimally explored. 
However, the only availability of the 100mg capsule limits the possibility of tailoring the dose and 
the resort to the oral solution raised the issue of poor acceptability. 
Clinical efficacy 
A single study (AI 424020) was submitted in support of the application. This ongoing study with a 
planned total duration of 96 weeks (plus potential extension in South Africa) was initiated on 
16 November 2000. The report presented is the 48 week interim report of the step 1 phase of the 
study, using a database lock date of 4 February 2008. The protocol was initially developed to 
evaluate atazanavir without ritonavir and later modified to include regimens of atazanavir with low-
dose ritonavir. The protocol was revised to allow for new sites in South Africa to participate in the 
study (Protocol Version 5, dated 23 September 2003). 
The MAH states that the laws and regulatory requirements of all countries participating in this study 
were adhered to and that this study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and for US sites in accordance 
with the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50.  
Study Design 
Study AI 424020 (PACTG 1020-A) is a multicentre, open-label phase 1/2 study to determine the 
pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy results for the dose-finding in antiretroviral naïve and 
experienced paediatric subjects aged 91 days to 21 years infected with HIV. Both the unboosted

and the boosted treatment regimen were combined with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs). 
Primary Objectives 
To determine the PK profile and dosing schedule for atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir in 
combination with 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected paediatric subjects for the powder and capsule 
formulation, respectively.  
• 
To determine the safety and tolerability of atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir in combination 
with 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected paediatric subjects 
Secondary Objectives

measured by viral load response in PI treatment-experienced and naïve study subjects 
• 
To assess the development of virological resistance as measured by genotypic and phenotypic 
assays during treatment with atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir 
Study participants

second degree atrioventricular (AV) block while awake, type II second degree AV block at any 
time, complete AV block at any time, or age-adjusted heart rate < 2nd percentile) 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were assigned to treatment groups, stratified by age, atazanavir formulation 
(powder or capsule), and concomitant administration of ritonavir.  
Step 1 (dose-finding) was conducted in the US and South Africa, and consisted of 2 parts: 
Part A (groups 1- 4): atazanavir plus 2 NRTIs (excluding abacavir sulfate [ABC, Ziagen] and 
Part B (groups 5- 8): atazanavir/ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs (excluding ABC and TDF). 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF, Viread]). 
 (At the time of initial protocol development only Groups 1 - 4 were implemented. The study was 
later modified to include regimens of atazanavir with ritonavir in Groups 5 - 8.) 
Step 2 will only be open to South African subjects who are virologically responding to treatment 
when the last enrolee into either part of Step 1 (Part A or Part B) has completed 96 weeks of 
CHMP variation assessment report

treatment (end of Step 1). Step 2 will continue in South Africa until atazanavir is approved and 
readily available. The subjects who participated in Study AI424020 were enrolled at a total of 36 
sites: 34 in the US and 2 in South Africa.

The atazanavir powder (50mg/1.5g) provided 50mg per scoop. The atazanavir capsules were 
supplied as 50, 100 and 200 mg strength. Ritonavir (Norvir, Abbott Laboratories) was supplied as 
soft gelatin capsules containing 100 mg ritonavir and as an oral solution (80 mg/ml). For all 
subjects, atazanavir was administered orally QD with food. Morning dosing was recommended, but 
evening dosing was permitted after intensive PK sampling had been completed and the final dose 
level of atazanavir had been determined for the group. For subjects receiving the atazanavir 
powder formulation, the appropriate amount of powder was mixed with a small amount of 
applesauce, milk, yogurt, or baby formula. Additionally, if preferred by the study patient and/or 
treating physician, the powder could be mixed with water, but only if dosing of this water-drug 
suspension is given with a light meal.  
Atazanavir dosing was based on body surface area (BSA) calculations for each subject based upon 
height and weight measurements. Subjects automatically had dose increases based on an increase 
in body weight of ≥ 25%. Repeat 24-hour PK evaluations were done 2 weeks after initiation of a 
new atazanavir dose, in the event that further dose changes were needed at this time.

Nucleoside backbone therapy was determined on the basis of the viral genotypic and phenotypic 
resistance profile and/or the subject’s treatment history. The choice of concomitant NRTI was at the 
investigator’s discretion; NRTIs were to be used in combinations recommended in the US Guideline 
for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents. The NRTIs ABC and TDF were not permitted. Additionally, for 
subjects receiving the powder formulation of atazanavir, the use of zalcitabine (ddC) for subjects 
previously treated with didanosine (ddI) and vice versa was not allowed. Dosage and administration 
of concomitant NRTIs were to be consistent with the manufacturer’s prescribing information. 
Dose selection 
Since treatment-experienced subjects were to be enrolled in this study and in anticipation of higher 
clearance in younger subjects, the starting dose for each group was initially chosen based on the 
atazanavir 600 mg QD PK data in HIV-infected adults in AI424008. In MAH sponsored adult trials, a 
once daily 400-mg dose of atazanavir had resulted in the majority of patients having trough levels 
above the IC90 (approximately 60 ng/ml, when adjusted for human serum protein binding). The 
expected inter-patient variability for AUC values is 30% to 50%. Thus, the PACTG 1020-A team 
decided on a minimum acceptable AUC value of 15,000 ng•h/ml for the study, believing that this 
value will provide trough levels in the range of the minimum trough target of 60 ng/ml. 
In light of the previously mentioned expected variability of AUC values of up to 50%, the protocol 
team had set a population AUC target for BMS-232632 at 45,000 ng•h/ml. An AUC value of  
45,000 ng•h/ml was selected as it was thought to cover the approximately 2-fold higher rate of 
hepatic clearance observed in young children versus adults taking protease inhibitors. Further, this 
exposure (projected from PK simulations) is similar to that of 600 mg QD, well tolerated by adult 
patients in BMS AI424-008. 
PK sampling schedule  
Two (2) 24h PK profiles were carried out, the first on day 7, the 2nd in week 56. Random samples 
were performed in week 12, 24, 36 and 72. Repeat 24-hour PK evaluations were done 2 weeks 
after initiation of a new atazanavir dose. Summaries and listings for PK parameters were based on 
age group defined as: 3 months to < 6 months, ≥ 6 months to ≤ 2 years > 2 years to < 6 years, ≥ 
6 years to ≤13 years, > 13 years to ≤ 18 years and >18 years to 21 years. 
Dose modification based on PK data: 
All groups began at 310 mg/m2 of atazanavir QD; the boosted groups (groups 5-8) also received 
ritonavir 100 mg/m2 QD. All groups escalated or decreased atazanavir doses based on PK exposure 
targets (after week 1) and safety criteria (after week 4): 
Acceptance criteria part A (groups 1-4), atazanavir alone: 
• 
• 
• 
no patient out of 5 had AUC < 15,000 ng.h/ml, 
at least 4 of the 5 patients reached an AUC > 30,000 ng.h/ml, and 
at least 4 of the patients reached Cmin ≥60 ng/ml. 
Five (5) subjects were to be enrolled in each group to receive the starting dose of atazanavir in the 
appropriate formulation and with or without ritonavir.  
• 
• 
If prospectively defined dose acceptance criteria, based upon intensive PK assessments made 
at Week 1 and safety data collected through Week 4, were not met, the atazanavir starting 
dose was either decreased or increased in the same group of 5 subjects.  
If dose acceptance criteria were met, an additional 5 subjects were enrolled at the same dose 
and the regimen evaluated once more with 10 total subjects. (In addition, for safety, there

could be no life-threatening toxicities, one or fewer Grade 3 or 4 toxicities (excluding bilirubin), 
and no more than 2 subjects could have a bilirubin level > 5.1 x ULN.)  
• 
• 
If still satisfying the dose acceptance criteria after 10 subjects, the group fully enrolled at that 
dosing cohort and treatment in Step 1 continued until 96 weeks after the last subject was 
enrolled in the respective study part.  
In case adjustment was necessary, repeat pharmacokinetic studies were to be performed 14 
days after dose adjustment to confirm adequate AUC values. 
Criteria for evaluation and endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The primary PK parameters were AUC(TAU) (referred as AUC 0-24 in the protocol), and Cmin 
(trough concentration). Clearance (CL/F), elimination half-life (T-half), peak concentration (Cmax), 
and time to peak concentration (Tmax) were secondary PK parameters. Standard non-
compartmental techniques were used to assess PK parameters. Analysis population were all treated 
subjects.  Subjects had intensive, 24-hour PK sampling at Week 1, and again at Week 56 for those 
who continued on study. Intensive, 24-hour PK sampling was also to be performed 2 weeks after a 
new dose of atazanavir had been initiated. A single 1.5 ml venous blood sample was obtained for 
population PK evaluations at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 72, 96 and every 24 weeks after Week 96 until the 
end of the study. These random PK samples were to be collected at least 3 hours after dose of 
atazanavir had been taken, and the time from the last dose of study medication was to be recorded. 
Efficacy 
The main efficacy endpoints included the following virologic and immunologic parameters: 
• 
Proportion achieving a 1 log10 reduction from baseline in HIV RNA level at Week 48 (VOLS) 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with HIV RNA < 400 c/ml and < 50 c/ml at Week 48 (VR) 
Time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) at Week 48 
Log10 c/ml HIV RNA change from baseline at Week 48 
•  CD4 cell count and CD4 percent change from baseline at Week 48 
•  CD8 cell count and CD8 percent change from baseline at Week 4 
For the VR analysis, subjects with HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml (or ≥ 400 c/ml), or who discontinued prior to 
the scheduled visit were considered failures in this analysis (Non-Completer = Failure [NC = F]). 
The VR-OC analysis was similar to the VR analysis except that subjects who discontinued prior to 
the scheduled Week 48 visit were excluded from this analysis (Non-Completer = Missing [NC = M], 
“Observed Cases”). 
TLOVR defined responders at Week 48 as subjects with confirmed HIV RNA < 50 c/ml (or < 400 
c/ml) through Week 48 without intervening virologic rebound or treatment discontinuation. 
Virologic rebound was defined as confirmed on-treatment HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml (or ≥ 400 c/ml) or 
last on-treatment HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml (or ≥ 400 c/ml) followed by discontinuation. Subjects were 
considered failures in this analysis if they experienced a virologic rebound at or before Week 48, 
discontinued at or before Week 48, never responded by Week 48, or had missing HIV RNA at Week 
48 and beyond. 
Resistance Profiles 
Plasma for phenotypic and genotypic resistance was collected from all subjects during screening. 
For the resistance analysis of the Week 48 CSR, samples were collected from MAH-identified-
subjects who had a virological rebound with at least 1 on treatment HIV RNA > 2000 c/ml on or 
after the rebound, or who discontinued the study therapy with the last on-treatment HIV RNA > 
2000 c/ml.

Safety  
Safety endpoints included the frequency of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), 
deaths, discontinuation due to AEs, laboratory abnormalities, and electrocardiograms. Grade 4 
clinical or laboratory observations triggered discontinuation of atazanavir and concomitant ARV 
(including ritonavir) therapy. Analysis population was all treated subjects (SAEs and deaths used all 
enrolled subjects).  Non-serious AEs were illnesses, and any signs and symptoms that appeared or 
worsened during the course of the trial. SAEs were required to be reported based on the PACTG 
1020-A protocol definition that follows reporting requirements as defined in the current US Division 
of AIDS Serious Adverse Experience Reporting Manual. All Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities 
suspected to be an adverse drug reaction were mandated to be reported as an SAE. Therefore, 
under the protocol definition, asymptomatic Grade 3 (3.0 - 7.5 x ULN) and Grade 4 (> 7.5 x ULN) 
bilirubin elevations, were required to be reported as SAEs. 
Protocol Deviations 
Forty (40) subjects (22%) had at least 1 eligibility deviation: 24% in the atazanavir alone group 
and 20% in the atazanavir/ritonavir group. Fourteen (14) subjects (8%) had at least 1 protocol 
deviation during the treatment period. Eleven (11) subjects (6%) were receiving prohibited 
concomitant medication (antiretroviral therapies other than the regimens used in the study): 4 
subjects in the atazanavir group and 7 subjects in the atazanavir/ritonavir group. For deviations 
related to PK, sample collection times deviating ≥ 30% from nominal times were considered 
significant time deviations. 
Discussion on study design 
The primary objective of this study was to establish a paediatric dosage regimen for atazanavir 
alone and atazanavir with ritonavir. PK studies were done on Day 7 after starting treatment to 
ensure measurements at steady state. In case a change of dose was necessary, a repeat PK profile 
was performed after 2 weeks. Another 24h profile was performed at week 56 for subjects who 
received a dose within 25% of the accepted dose. 
No sample size calculation was provided, group sizes were determined by consensus decision 
between MAH and protocol group. 
The separation of the study into two parts A and B investigating different treatments in 4 age strata 
each results in 8 subgroups. Each of these subgroups includes varying proportions of treatment 
naïve and treatment experience patients. The use of two different formulations further adds to 
complexity, as the study results indicate that the 2 formulations may not bioequivalent. This makes 
the interpretation of the study results very difficult as very few patients have been investigated in 
each of the sub-groups.  
Outcomes 
In the following sections, treatment regimens are referred to as atazanavir (Groups 1 - 4) and 
atazanavir/ritonavir (Groups 5 - 8). To facilitate the description of the data throughout the text, the 
protocol-defined age categories are referred to as Infants (3 mo to ≤ 2 yrs); Children (> 2 yrs to 
≤ 13 yrs), and Adolescents (> 13 yrs to ≤ 21 yrs). Although the protocol considered Adolescents as 
> 13 yrs to 21 yrs, the subgroup tables for this report used the following categories: Adolescents 
> 13 yrs to ≤ 18 yrs and Adults > 18 yrs. 
Baseline Demographics 
Of the 183 enrolled subjects, 182 subjects (99%) were treated: 85 with atazanavir alone and 97 
with atazanavir/ritonavir. A total of 116 subjects received capsules and 66 subjects received the 
powder formulation.  Of the 182 treated patients, 81 were ART naïve (31 in the atazanavir group, 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/356437/2010  
Page 17/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50 in the atazanavir/ritonavir group) and 101 were treatment experienced (57 received atazanavir, 
47 received atazanavir/ritonavir). 
The age distribution differs between atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir group as very few subject 
< 2 years of age were enrolled in group 1 (atazanavir alone), increasing the median age of the 
atazanavir alone cohort. There are more black/mixed subjects in the atazanavir/ritonavir group, 
reflecting enrolment in South Africa in part B of the study, where no white subjects were enrolled. 
Discontinuation of treatment prior to or on the Week 24 visit was 16% overall, 16% each in both 
atazanavir (n= 14) group and the atazanavir/ritonavir group (n=16). The most common (≥ 3% 
overall) reasons were toxicity, protocol compliance issues, and request for treatment 
discontinuation. By week 48 a total of 27 (32%) of subjects had withdrawn from the atazanavir 
group. In the atazanavir/ritonavir group, there were 22 (12%) withdrawals in total. The most 
common (≥ 3% overall) reason for withdrawal after week 24 was clinical events or disease 
progression and protocol compliance issues.  
The median baseline HIV RNA plasma levels were 4.72 log10 c/ml, median baseline CD4 cell 
absolute numbers were 450 cells/mm3, and the median baseline CD4 cell percentage was 18%. 
Mean and median HIV RNA levels were similar for the atazanavir and the atazanavir/ritonavir group, 
while CD4 count was higher in the atazanavir/ritonavir group. 
Overall, the majority of treated subjects (55%) received ARV therapy prior to study entry 
(atazanavir alone 64%; atazanavir/ritonavir 48%) More subjects (54%) had prior NRTI experience 
than prior PI experience (41%) and prior non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
experience (34%). Median length of ARV treatment was 321.6 weeks, with treatment length for 
NRTI/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) (333.1 weeks) > PI (178.1 weeks) > 
NNRTI (86.4 weeks). The proportions of ARV-experienced subjects were 45% in Infants, 57% in 
Children, 59% in Adolescents, and 56% in Adults. The median time on prior ARVs was 43.7 weeks 
in Infants, 303.6 weeks in Children and 562.9 weeks in Adolescents. Naïve patients were younger 
than experienced patients and were mainly black patients, from Africa. 
Median duration of treatment was 88.1 weeks (range 0.7 to 361.1 weeks). Median time on therapy 
was 97.6 weeks (range 0.7 to 361.1 weeks) for subjects receiving atazanavir (Groups 1 - 4) and 
82.1 weeks (range 1.0 to 233.9 weeks) for subjects receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (Groups 5 - 8). 
The atazanavir/ritonavir group started later than the atazanavir group; therefore, overall exposure 
on atazanavir/ritonavir was much shorter than for the atazanavir group. 
The most common initial NRTI backbone combination therapies were 3TC+d4T (43%), 3TC+ZDV 
(20%), and d4T+ddI (20%) (Table 6.4 and Table S.4.4). All other NRTI backbone combination 
therapies were used by ≤ 4% of subjects overall. 
Pharmacokinetic results - atazanavir with ritonavir 
The initial dosing cohort of 310 mg/m2 for Group 5 and 6 met the PK criteria set forth in the 
protocol. While AUC in group 5 was comparable to adults, Cmin was lower although all patients 
exceeded the target limit of 120ng/ml. 
In contrast to the patients in Group 6, who were also 2 - 13 years of age but using the powder 
formulation, the PK from the initial dosing cohort of 310 mg/m2 for Group 7 (capsule formulation) 
did not meet the PK criteria set forth in the protocol because they were higher than allowed per 
protocol targets (median AUC > 60 µg•h/ml) and were notably higher than those that would be

observed in adults receiving atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg QD. The target dose for this 
Group was reduced to 205 mg/m2 and this dose met the protocol-specified PK criteria. 
The PK initial dosing cohort of 310 mg/m2 in Group 8 did not meet the PK criteria because they 
were higher than allowed per protocol targets (median AUC> 60 µg•h/ml). The target dose for 
Group 8 was reduced to 205 mg/m2 and this dose met the protocol-specified PK criteria. It should 
be noted that 6 of 10 subjects received a dose in excess of the currently recommended atazanavir 
adult dose of 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in ARV-experienced subjects and some subjects in this 
group had a BSA ≥ 2 m2. 
Table 4.1 shows the PK parameters in subjects who received protocol accepted ATV capsule dose 
(205 mg/m²) + RTV. 
The following figures shows the observed paediatric concentration time profiles by the weight 
groups identified in comparison to the 5th, 25th 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles of observed adult 
data.

The above graphs presenting the observed ATV concentration-time profiles for paediatric patients 
receiving the recommended RTV-boosted ATV by weight bands are reassuring since the observed 
paediatric data well fit the historical adult data and mainly fall within the 5th to 95th percentiles. 
As the PPK modelling arrived at dosing recommendations based on BWT and the study was 
performed using a BSA approach, the following comparison of % difference in dose, together with 
an assessment of the differences in exposure parameters was provided.  
Table 6 provides a comparison of BSA-based boosted capsule ATV doses given in AI424020 with 
the corresponding BW-based doses.

When comparing the proposed BW-based derived from the modelling/simulation to the BSA-based 
doses administered in the clinical study, it is noteworthy that these doses are similar except for the 
> 40 kg weight-band where the BSA-based dose is higher than the BWT-based dose. This is related 
to the fact that in the clinical study AI424020, patients were allowed to receive ATV doses higher 
than 300 mg, since ATV doses were not capped at the recommended adult dose. However, the 
proposed BWT-based doses for this application are capped at the 300 mg adult dose. 
Figures 6.1 presents comparisons of model-simulated exposures (using the final model parameter 
estimates) at the proposed BW-based dosing with the observed exposures at the protocol-accepted 
BSA-based dosing in Study AI424020 (ATV capsule doses boosted with RTV).

The observed C24 in AI424020 extend over the range of simulated exposure for summary measure 
of C24 produced by all the proposed ATV doses.  AUC and Cmax ranges from the proposed BW-
based doses extend beyond the observed values in subjects who received ATV capsules boosted 
with RTV (Group 7 and 8 in AI424020).  
But, these exposure levels have been observed in AI424020 when data from all subjects are plotted 
(Figure 6.2), including those who received unboosted ATV and ATV powder formulation with and 
without RTV.

Overall, the MAH concluded that in addition to offer clinical convenience, the proposed BWT-based 
dosing recommendations provide: 
-  adequate Cmin levels that are similar to the BSA-based doses accepted in Study AI424020 and 
are supported by PK/PD data from adult studies; 
-  AUC levels that are comparable to that in adults; and  
-  Cmax levels that are within the observed exposure range supported by clinical safety. 
Clearance Evaluation for atazanavir with ritonavir 
For atazanavir with ritonavir, the apparent oral clearance of both the powder and the capsule 
increased with age and the range of observations overlapped considerably at all ages except the 
extremes. When adjusted for by BWT or BSA, the clearance was decreased slightly with age (more 
notably with BWT) and variability was noted to be higher in younger subjects. The MAH concluded 
that the reduction in oral clearance per kg with age explains the higher per kg doses required in 
younger subjects to achieve similar AUC values.

Thirty-four (34) paediatric subjects, aged 5.6 to 21.6 years old, who received the protocol-accepted 
ATV capsule at a dose of 205 mg/m² plus RTV, provided valid dose finding PK. Figures 10.1 and 
10.2 below showed scatter plots of individual CL/F vs. age and body weight, respectively. 
As can be seen in the scatter plots above, CL/F for ATV appears to be correlated to both age and 
body weight; as expected, age and BW are themselves correlated. These observed data are 
consistent with the finding from the final population PK model that CL/F increases with body weight 
with a power coefficient to 0.6. Although AUC are largely similar between the different age groups 
CHMP variation assessment report

Page 25/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receiving the accepted ATV capsule dose, there was an apparent tendency of higher Cmax and 
lower Cmin, or greater peak-to-trough ratio, in younger children (Figure 10.3). 
Besides an apparent ATV CL/F vs. age relationship, in children who received the ATV capsule 
formulation and RTV, ATV peak-to-trough ratio appeared to be inversely correlated with age (Figure 
10.4) and body weight (Figure 10.5). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/356437/2010  
Page 26/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the final population PK model, developed based on data including both boosted and unboosted 
regimen, powder and capsule formulation, age was found to be a significant covariate on the first 
order oral absorption rate constant Ka in that younger age was associated with a higher rate of 
absorption. This model identified that the covariate effect is consistent with the higher Cmax 
observed in younger children (Figure 10.3).  
However, how younger age could result in faster decline in ATV plasma concentrations and 
consequently lower Cmin is not clear. It cannot be ruled out though that younger age and 
CHMP variation assessment report

Page 27/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corresponding lower body weight may potentially alter the plasma concentration time profile of ATV 
through pharmacokinetic processes other than the overall CL/F, such as apparent volume of 
distribution. The more pronounced peak to trough ratio seen with powder formulation may also 
reflect the effect of age because the majority of patients who took the powder formulation were 
younger than 6 years old. Note, however, in Figure 10.5 that the apparent trend in peak-to-trough 
ratio and body weight seems to level off at body weight > 30 kg. A greater peak-to-trough ratio is 
mainly observed in younger children. In patients aged 6 years and older, the scope of the proposed 
extension of indication, this concern is quite alleviated. 
Confirmatory PK observations at week 56 
At 56 weeks, a total of 20 subjects age > 2 yrs to 13 yrs of age taking a dose of powder were 
within 25% of the accepted dose of 310 mg/m2 and 11 subjects in the same age group (Group 7) 
were within 25% of 205 mg/m2 for the capsule. The PK for powder at 310 mg/m2 with ritonavir at 
Week 56 were comparable to that observed in the dose finding exercise, but for the capsule, they 
were lower and more variable. The MAH states that closer examination of the data reveals that 
three subjects taking the capsule had relatively low atazanavir exposures. Two (2) of these subjects 
with low exposures had available pre-dose concentration data which were below the limit of 
quantitation (BLQ), suggestive of poor adherence. The third subject did not a have a pre-dose value 
reported, but concentrations for this subject never exceeded 1000 ng/ml, which would be unusual 
for atazanavir with ritonavir. 
Additionally, there were 3 subjects > 13 yrs to 18 yrs of age taking a dose of capsule within 25% of 
205 mg/m2 with ritonavir at 56 weeks on study. Although the number of observations was small, 
the AUC(TAU), Cmax and Cmin values from the three subjects between from > 13 to 18 years of 
age were higher than the adults at atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 once daily. Each of the subjects 
received 400 mg of atazanavir with ritonavir. 
Pharmacokinetic results - ritonavir 
The range of ritonavir exposures overlaps across groups, with a trend toward lower exposures in 
the adolescents and adults. The MAH states that the difference in ritonavir exposure does not 
appear to produce marked differences in atazanavir exposure across these groups as AUC values 
are similar and the highest atazanavir Cmins were associated with the lowest ritonavir AUC in 
Group 8. 
Pharmacokinetics by Region and prior treatment status 
There is an apparent regional effect in the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir without ritonavir. 
Differences in exposures based on region suggest that patients in South Africa have lower 
exposures and may have higher clearance or lower bioavailability or both compared to US based 
patients. Similarly, treatment experienced patients have higher exposures compared to treatment 
naïve patients when receiving atazanavir alone. 
Both regional and prior treatment status differences are not seen to a large extend after 
atazanavir/ritonavir. In Groups 5-8 Cmin is lower for South African patients compared to US 
patients and in treatment naïve patients compared to those with treatment experience, but in all 
patients the preset criteria were met. The MAH states that as US patients are expected to have a 
higher body weight, and as clearance declines with weight, it would be expected that lower doses 
per kg would be needed as body size increases. The proportion of treatment naïve patients was 
larger in the African subjects and the MAH suggests that treatment experience assessment is likely 
to be confounded by regional assessment.

Discussion on Pharmacokinetics  
Atazanavir with ritonavir 
The addition of ritonavir to atazanavir considerably reduces the clearance of atazanavir and the 
peak to trough ratio. Generally, the PK profiles in the paediatric groups are closer to the adult PK 
parameters than for atazanavir alone. However, the ratio of ritonavir to atazanavir was not justified, 
neither the ritonavir dose of 100mg/m2 across all age groups. Data presented suggest higher 
exposure (compared to adults) for ritonavir in all groups except Group 8.  
Week 56 confirmatory PK data is difficult to adequately interpret, as compliance was unfortunately 
not collected in the study.  
The primary endpoint of the study was dose determination. However, the data presented leave 
some doubt about the appropriateness of the doses selected. Efficacy should hence be used to 
support or reject the proposed doses. A comparison of % difference in dose with the suggested 
weight based dosing and the BSA based dosing used in the clinical studies showed comparability. 
The provided data support the proposed BWT-based doses. However, the safety issue, especially 
the cardiac tolerance (see safety part), will have to be kept under close scrutiny, in view of the 
higher predicted values for Cmax and AUC compared to observed values.   
As previously underlined, when comparing atazanavir PK results for patients receiving ritonavir-
boosted atazanavir as a capsule formulation, one can observe that mean Cmax values are higher in 
younger patients (<13 years) compared to older patients (>13 years), whereas mean Cmin values 
are lower in younger patients compared to older patients. Regarding mean AUC values, a 
consistency is noted for patients in the whole age range from 6 to 13 years.

The actual number of children aged 6-18 years, i.e. the target population for this extension 
indication, and treated by RTV-boosted ATV as a capsule formulation is quite limited (16 naïve 
patients and 25 experienced patients). Therefore, post-marketing surveillance in this population will 
be key. A marked difference (around 2-fold) is observed between the rate of responders in naïve 
patients and experienced patients. In naïve patients, the rate of responders is quite satisfactory 
(around 80%); it is much less satisfactory in experienced patients (around 40%). However, it is 
acknowledged that based on PK/PD characteristics and the clinical experience gained in adults, this

ATV/RTV is not a suitable option for multi-resistance patients. The poor results obtained in 
experienced paediatric patients underline this observation.

Virologic Response-Observed Cases  
In total 133 subject were observed until at least week 48, 58 in the atazanavir alone and 75 in the 
atazanavir/ritonavir cohort. Overall, the proportion of treated subjects who achieved VR (HIV RNA 
< 400 c/ml) based on observed cases (VR-OC) was 70%, 59% in the atazanavir alone group and 
79% in the atazanavir/ritonavir group. Results for VR-OC (HIV RNA < 50 c/ml) were consistent with 
those for VR-OC (HIV RNA < 400 c/ml).  
Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) at Week 48 
The proportion of subjects who were responders for HIV RNA <400 c/ml at Week 48 based on the 
TLOVR was 54% overall, 44% in the atazanavir alone group and 63% in the atazanavir/ritonavir 
group. Based on HIV RNA< 400 c/ml, in the atazanavir alone group, 39% were classed as 
virological failures, 18 % suffered a rebound and 21% were never suppressed. In the 
atazanavir/ritonavir group, 23% were failures with 11% suffering a rebound and 11% never 
suppressed.  At Week 48, the overall mean HIV RNA decrease from baseline was -2.20 log10 c/ml 
(-1.84 log10 c/ml atazanavir, -2.46 log10 c/ml atazanavir/ritonavir) 
Immunologic response 
Treatment-naïve subjects had a median increase from baseline in CD4 cell counts of 237 cells/mm3 
and treatment-experienced subjects had a median increase from baseline in CD4 cell counts of 
127 cells/mm3.  Overall, CD8 cell counts decreased while on study therapy. The mean change from 
baseline overall at Week 48 in CD8 count was -411 cells/mm3 (atazanavir -233 cells/mm3 and 
atazanavir/ritonavir -540 cells/mm3) 
Resistance 
For the resistance analysis of the Week 48, samples were collected from MAH-identified-subjects 
who had a virologic rebound with at least 1 on-treatment HIV RNA > 2000 c/ml on or after the 
rebound, or who discontinued the study therapy with the last on-treatment HIV RNA > 2000 c/ml. 
Genotypic resistance 
Of the 81 ART naïve subjects: 
Nineteen (19) had baseline genotypic resistance profiles (10/31 in the atazanavir group and 9/50 in 
the atazanavir/ritonavir group). Among the 10 isolates from atazanavir subjects, there were no

substitutions consisting of thymidine associated mutations (TAMs), there were no baseline protease 
inhibitor (PI) substitutions or RT substitutions. In the atazanavir/ritonavir group, the single baseline 
substitutions were PI (A71V), NNRTI (K103N), and reverse transcriptase (RT) substitutions (M41L). 
Newly emergent genotypic resistance profiles were observed for 3/31 ART-naïve subjects in the 
atazanavir group (all 3 isolates had RT substitutions) and for 7/50 ART-naïve subjects in the 
atazanavir/ritonavir group. Two of the 7 isolates from the atazanavir/ritonavir subjects had RT 
substitutions; 2/7 had M184M/V, and there were no PI substitutions observed. 
Of the 101 ART-experienced subjects: 
In the atazanavir group, 53 of 54 subjects had baseline genotypes. At baseline, 25/53 had PI 
substitutions, 45/53 had RT substitutions and 25/53 had NNRTI substitutions. In the 
atazanavir/ritonavir group, 30 of the 47 subjects had baseline genotypes. Minor and major PI 
substitutions observed at baseline included L33F (7%), M46I/L (10%), A71I/V/N/T (23%), I84I/V 
(7%), N88N/D (7%), and L90M (13%); 26/30 had RT substitutions and 19/30 had NNRTI 
substitutions. 
Newly emergent genotypic resistance profiles were observed for 42/54 ARV-experienced subjects in 
the atazanavir group. Minor and major PI substitutions emerged in 15 of these 42, 13/42 had RT 
substitutions. Newly emergent genotypic resistance profiles were observed for 21/47ARV-
experienced subjects in the atazanavir/ritonavir group; 3 had PI substitutions and RT substitutions 
each. 
Phenotypic resistance 
Phenotypic cut-offs for sensitivity for PIs used in this analysis were: atazanavir > 2.2, indinavir > 
2.1, lopinavir > 9, nelfinavir > 3.6, ritonavir > 2.5, and saquinavir > 1.7. Among treatment-naïve 
subjects, 18 subjects (7/31 atazanavir and 11/50 atazanavir/ritonavir) had baseline phenotypic 
data available. There was no demonstrable phenotypic resistance to any NRTI, NNRTI or PI in the 
atazanavir/ritonavir group. In the atazanavir group, one subject had phenotypic resistance to 3TC. 
Among treatment-experienced subjects, 46/54 subjects had baseline phenotypic testing (44 were 
phenotypable) in the atazanavir group and there was demonstrable phenotypic resistance to 
multiple antiretroviral classes including atazanavir (25%) and ritonavir (23%). In 
atazanavir/ritonavir group, 28/47 subjects had phenotypic testing at baseline (25 were 
phenotypable). There was demonstrable phenotypic resistance to multiple antiretroviral classes 
including atazanavir (20%) and ritonavir (24%).  
On-study phenotypic resistance profiles although collected for ARV-naïve subjects and ARV-
experienced subjects, was only available for subjects with viral load rebounds of HIV RNA > 2000 
c/ml, on-study or at the time of discontinuation. 
In the treatment-naïve group, 4/31 (13%) subjects in the atazanavir group and 8/50 (16%) in the 
atazanavir/ritonavir group had both baseline and on study phenotypic resistance profiles. Among 
subjects in the atazanavir group, 2 out of 4 subjects tested showed the emergence of any new drug 
resistance on study (1 subject developed phenotypic resistance to atazanavir and 1 to 3TC), 
compared to 4 out of 8 in the atazanavir/ritonavir group (2 subjects had resistance emerge to 3TC 
and, and 1 subject had resistance emerge to DDI and 1 subject had resistance emerge to NFV). 
In the treatment-experienced group, 34/54 (63%) subjects in the atazanavir group (34/34 
phenotypable) and 18/47 (38%) in the atazanavir/ritonavir group (17/18 phenotypable) had both

baseline and on study phenotypic resistance profiles. Among subjects in the atazanavir group, there 
were demonstrable phenotypic resistance to multiple antiretroviral classes including 3TC (12%), 
ABC (12%), AMP (3%), D4T (9%), atazanavir (12%), ddI (21%), LPV (3%), NFV and NVP (3% 
each), ritonavir (3%), SQV (9%), TDF (12%), and ZDV (9%). In atazanavir/ritonavir group, there 
were demonstrable phenotypic resistance to multiple antiretroviral classes including 3TC and ABC 
(18% each), AMP and atazanavir (6% each), ddI (12%), LPV (12%), NFV (6%), NVP (6%), 
ritonavir (6%), SQV (6%), and ZDV (12%). 
Discussion on Efficacy 
Treatment experienced patients (55% of all included) included 41% of subjects with prior PI 
experience and the median length of ARV treatment was 5 years. Although the study was not 
primarily intended to assess efficacy the following observations are made: 
Atazanavir alone 
Overall 40% of subjects had HIV RNA <400 c/ml at week 48 and 26% were <50c/ml. Only 25% of 
adolescents had HIV RNA <400 c/ml and 16% were <50c/ml. Results for treatment experienced 
patients were 30% and 15% for HIV RNA <400 and <50 c/ml, the equivalent figures for treatment 
naïve subjects were 58 and 45%. Results seen for atazanavir alone were less favourable than those 
for atazanavir/ritonavir seen in paediatric subjects in this study. Virological response to atazanavir 
alone does also not achieve levels comparable to that seen in adults receiving atazanavir/ritonavir. 
The data presented do not support unboosted atazanavir for treatment of HIV infected subjects and 
the MAH has not requested this indication. 
Atazanavir with ritonavir 
Overall 61% of subjects had HIV RNA <400 c/ml at week 48 and 46% had <50c/ml. Of the 
97 patients included, 48% of patients were treatment naïve. Treatment naïve patients had HIV RNA 
<50 c/ml in 66% of cases. This does not compare favourably to figures from studies in adults 
where 78% of treatment naïve patients had HIV RNA <50 c/ml at week 48 (study 138 BMS, see 
SmPC Reyataz hard capsules). Treatment experienced subjects had HIV RNA < 400c/ml in 43% 
and <50c/ml in 26%. Again, this does not compare favourably to adult figures of 53% <400c/ml 
and 36% <50c/ml (study 045, see SmPC Reyataz hard capsules). Mean HIV RNA decrease from 
baseline was -2.84 log10 for treatment naïve patients and -1.95 log10 for treatment experienced 
subjects. Comparable figures for adults were -3.09 log10 for treatment naïve and -1.93 log10 for 
experienced patients. Immunological parameters were similar.  
The doses used were selected based on Day 7 PK and Day 40 safety data and not on the virological 
response. Data must be interpreted with caution, particularly in view of the small numbers of 
subjects that remain in each subgroup when results are separated between ART naïve and 
experienced patients.  
With no active control arm in this study, which is the usual situation in studies with ARTs in children, 
and with difficulties in making inter-study comparisons, it can only be stated that the response 
rates to atazanavir/ritonavir were seemingly lower than would be expected from studies with 
atazanavir/ritonavir in adults.  
The primary objective of the study was to establish a dose regimen in children. While the doses 
accepted (except for the dose for subjects from 5- <10kg) have met the MAH’s preset exposure 
criteria, demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety are used to establish that the correct dose was 
selected for each age or weight bracket. Here, however, the very small subgroups make a full 
interpretation of the data difficult.

Resistance 
On study resistance data were obtained from treatment naïve and experienced subjects who 
experienced virologic failure and had at least 2000c/ml HIV RNA. Newly emergent genotypic 
resistance profiles were observed for 10 ART-naïve subjects. As only 19 of the 81 ART naïve 
subjects had genotype profiles done at baseline, 10 out of 19 subjects tested on both occasions had 
virus with emergent genotypic resistance. Similarly, it appears from the data presented that newly 
emergent genotypic resistance profiles were observed in 63/83 viruses from ART-experienced 
subjects that were genotyped.  
Of the 12 viruses from ART naïve subjects that were phenotyped at baseline and on study, 6 had 
evidence of newly emergent phenotypic resistance while on treatment. Among the 51 viruses from 
ART-experienced patients that were phenotyped at baseline and on- study the study report states 
that there was demonstrable phenotypic resistance to multiple antiretroviral classes. However it is 
not possible to discern the numbers of viruses that demonstrated resistance to multiple classes. 
Virological failure (at < 50c/ml level) was observed in 22 of the 81 ART naïve patients and in 58 out 
of 101 ART experienced patients. It would appear that not every patient who experienced 
virological failure had newly emergent resistance. The reason for those remaining cases of 
virological failure is unclear, adherence or unpredictable exposure may have played a role.  
Clinical safety - Data from study AI424020 
Patient exposure 
Median duration of treatment was 88.1 weeks (range 0.7 to 361.1 weeks). Median time on therapy 
was 97.6 weeks (range 0.7 to 361.1 weeks) for subjects receiving ATV alone (Part A, Groups 1 - 4) 
and 82.1 weeks (range 1.0 to 233.9 weeks) for subjects receiving ATV/RTV (Part B, Groups 5 - 8). 
All Grades of Adverse Events 
The most common adverse events (AEs) were laboratory abnormalities. Among the laboratory 
abnormalities; blood bilirubin unconjugated increased (92%) was the most common. AEs of any 
grade that were not laboratory abnormalities included cough (76%), pyrexia (47%), vomiting 
(45%), rash (40%), rhinorrhoea (39%), nasal congestion (33%), diarrhoea (31%), ocular icterus 
(23%), headache (23%), skin lesion (20%), and lymphadenopathy (22%). 
Deaths 
Three subjects died during the study; these 3 deaths were considered by the investigator not to be 
related to atazanavir. The causes of death were as follows: acute respiratory distress syndrome and 
sepsis (atazanavir, age 16, death 239 days after discontinuation of study drug), congestive heart 
failure secondary to HIV cardiomyopathy (atazanavir, age 13, death 136 days after discontinuation 
of study drug), and pneumonia and renal failure (atazanavir/ritonavir, age 23 months, death while 
on study medication). 
Serious Adverse events 
Overall serious AEs (SAEs) were reported for 48% of subjects. The most common SAEs were 
laboratory abnormalities. Among the laboratory abnormalities, blood bilirubin increase (36%) was 
the most common. The most frequently reported (>10%) Grade 2-4 AEs that were not laboratory 
abnormalities were cough (21%) and pyrexia (20%).  By age group, SAEs were reported more 
often in Adolescents (63%) than in Children (44%) and Infants (34%). SAEs were reported more 
frequently (≥10% difference) in treatment-experienced subjects compared with treatment-naïve 
CHMP variation assessment report

subjects. Overall, 53% of subjects who received capsules and 39% who received powder had 
reported SAEs. 
Differences in SAE rates between the subgroups arise from the different composition of the 
subpopulations in the AI424020 study. In the report, safety data were analysed and presented by 
treatment regimen, age group, formulation, prior treatment status, and region. Higher rates of 
SAEs were observed in ART-experienced subjects compared to ART-naïve subjects (56% vs. 38%), 
and in subjects from US compared to subjects from Africa (52% vs. 40%), especially in ATV/RTV 
group (52% vs. 35%) (Table 3.1). 
On the other hand, 95% of ART-experienced subjects were from North America, indicating that 
these 2 factors were highly correlated. Higher percentages of ART-experienced subjects and US 
subjects were also observed in the capsule formulation relative to the powder and in adolescents 
relative to children. These subcategory analyses were intended to be descriptive only, as there 
were multiple baseline and on-study confounding factors within each subgroup that obscure 
comparisons. To further obfuscate the issue, the subgroups had different median time on study 
therapy, overall and by treatment. The study was not designed to single out factors that could 
cause a higher rate of SAEs and the MAH does not want to speculate based on possible random 
variation due to the amount of overlap of each of the factors. 
PR Interval Prolongation 
Based on actual ECG measurements, 44 subjects (24%) overall had asymptomatic AV block, 
26 (31%) treated with atazanavir alone and 18 (19%) treated with atazanavir/ritonavir. Two (2)of 
the 44 cases were second degree AV block (one subject had a rare Mobitz type 1 second degree AV 
block that resolved without discontinuing study medication, a second subject experienced a Mobitz 
type 1 second degree AV block during sleep, which the investigators considered a normal variant in 
healthy children and which was not graded as per protocol). Of the 44 AV blocks measured, 5 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/356437/2010  
Page 38/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects had an AV block reported as a SAE. Two subjects were discontinued from the study due to 
first degree AV block. 
Other cardiac abnormalities 
Grade 2-4 cardiac AEs were reported in 8 subjects, all of the 8 subjects received atazanavir alone 
(9%). These events were reported as AEs or SAEs by the investigator. One subject who received 
800mg atazanavir twice daily instead of once for 3 days showed QRS prolongation with 
intraventricular conduction delay, with a return to normal after interruption of the study medication. 
Cardiac Toxicity 
According to the MAH, the therapeutic margin for cardiac toxicity in the paediatric population is 
consistent with that already established in adults. AI424020 is a dose-finding study that targets 
adult AUCs reference values of 45,000 ng*h/ml, which in adults are associated to average Cmax 
values of 4,400 ng/ml, and for which safety has been established. In adults, concentration 
dependent cardiac toxicity relates to the finding of asymptomatic PR prolongation driven by Cmax. 
Asymptomatic PR prolongation was observed more frequently in AI424020 than previously reported 
in adult trials. 
This observation is expected given the higher Cmax values achieved on average in this study. Of 
note, Cmax values as high as 20,000 ng/ml (at least 3 times the adult average values) were well 
tolerated in paediatric subjects treated in this study. As Table 6.1 shows, although 32 of 182 
subjects had Cmax above 7000 ng/ml for at least 8 weeks, only 4 of them were treated with 
ATV/RTV capsules (which is the proposed mode of dosing supported by this application). 
Table 6.1 presents a summary of the subjects with the highest Cmax values (15-20 µg/ml) and the 
corresponding PR interval, confirming the tolerability of this drug in the upper bound of the 
therapeutic range in the paediatric population. 
No other concentration-safety cardiac toxicity (i.e., QTc prolongation) was observed in the 
paediatric population, consistent with adults. In a definitive ECG study in healthy adults, there was 
no concentration-dependent effect of ATV on the QTc interval (using Fridericia's correction). In 
1793 HIV-infected subjects receiving antiretroviral regimens, QTc prolongation was comparable in 
the ATV and comparator regimens. No healthy subject or HIV-infected subject treated with ATV in 
BMS studies had a QTc interval >500 msec. Consistent with the adult observations, QTc 
prolongations in the AI424020 study were infrequent, with only one subject experiencing a QTcB 
interval prolongation of 482 msec (highest QTcF 441 msec). This subject had a prolonged QTcB 
(440-446 msec) at baseline.

Intraventricular conduction delay has been reported very rarely with atazanavir therapy in adults, 
and only in the setting of known cardiac conduction abnormalities at baseline, in contrast to PR 
prolongation, which is observed more frequently. Based on the data from the AI424020 study, it is 
not anticipated that paediatric patients would be at increased risk for cardiac failure due to 
conduction delay relative to adults. Four subjects in this study had investigator-documented QRS 
widening reported in the case report form. Of those, only one (Subject AI424020-800262) actually 
had a true prolongation relative to age with a value of 0.1 sec (normal for age: up to 0.08 sec). 
This subject had a history of cardiac abnormality and core pulmonare prior to enrolment and was 
treated with ATV unboosted at a dose of 1,100 mg QD (this dose not supported in this submission). 
Hyperbilirubinemia, Jaundice, and Ocular Icterus in Overall Treated Subjects 
In this study, any lab abnormality ≥ Grade 1 was reported as an AE. As an AE, hyperbilirubinemia 
(Grade 2-4) was reported in 65% of subjects overall (55% atazanavir, 73% atazanavir/ritonavir) 
Grade 3-4 total bilirubin levels were reported in 39% of subjects overall (41% atazanavir, 
37% atazanavir/ritonavir). In addition, ocular icterus was reported in 5% of subjects, and jaundice 
was reported in 2% of subjects. Increased blood bilirubin levels/jaundice led to discontinuation of 
5 atazanavir treated subjects (6%) and 4 atazanavir/ritonavir treated subjects (4%). 
Among the subset of subjects age ≥3 months and <18 years (treatment naïve and treatment 
experienced), hyperbilirubinemia was reported as an AE (Grade 2-4) in 75% of subjects, Grade 3-4 
total bilirubin levels were reported in 38% of  those subjects overall.  
Using the reporting requirements criteria as defined in the 2004 U.S Division of AIDS (DAIDS) 
Serious Adverse Experience Reporting Manual and a uniform upper limit of normal (ULN) of  
1.2 mg/dl, the proportions of subjects in the paediatric cohort (excluding the 9 young adults age 
18- 21) with normal baseline total bilirubin and Grade 3 to 4 on-study total bilirubin were 45%, 
46%, and 44% for the overall population, atazanavir alone group, and atazanavir/ritonavir group, 
respectively. Using the DAIDS criteria, the proportions of subjects who received powder with 
normal baseline and Grade 3 to 4 on-study total bilirubin were 36%, 47%, and 32% for the overall 
population, atazanavir alone group, and atazanavir/ritonavir group, respectively.  
Discontinuation of Study Therapy Related to Adverse Events 
Discontinuations related to AEs were reported for 15% of subjects, 17 (20%) treated with 
atazanavir and 10 (10%) treated with atazanavir/ritonavir. 15 subjects (10 treated with atazanavir 
and 5 treated with (atazanavir/ritonavir) discontinued with the reason specified as ‘toxicity’. In 
addition, 12 subjects had additional information on the discontinuation page that indicated the 
reason for discontinuing could have been related to an AE. Seven (7) out of 12 were treated in the 
atazanavir group and 5 were treated in the atazanavir/ritonavir group 
Discontinuations related to cardiovascular events, including first degree heart block (n= 2), 
worsening of cardiomyopathy, QTcB interval > 470 msec, prolonged PR interval and bradycardia, 
and worsening cardiac condition (reported in 2 subjects), were reported in 3% of subjects overall 
(all received atazanavir alone). Five (5) atazanavir-treated subjects (6%) and 4 
atazanavir/ritonavir treated subjects (4%) discontinued in relation to increased bilirubin 
levels/jaundice; 3 of these discontinuations were mandated by the protocol. In addition, 3 
atazanavir-treated subjects (4%) and 0 atazanavir/ritonavir treated subjects were discontinued due 
to vomiting. Discontinuations due to other AEs were reported in 1 or 2 subjects in each group. A 
higher proportion of Adolescents (10/46, 22%) compared with Infants (3/29, 10%) and Children 
(13/98, 13%) had treatment discontinued related to AEs.

Treatment-emergent Diagnoses 
The most common treatment-emergent diagnoses (Total ≥ 10%) were otitis media acute (28%), 
tinea infection (16%), pneumonia (15%), pharyngitis (14%), acute sinusitis (13%), acarodermatitis 
(11%), and impetigo (10%) 
Discussion on Safety 
The overall number of AEs is rather higher than would be expected.  
In the atazanavir alone group, 10 (12%) subjects withdrew because of toxicity and a further 
2 requested discontinuation. In the atazanavir/ritonavir group, 5 (5%) subjects withdrew due to 
toxicity and a further 5 requested discontinuation of treatment. Discontinuations due to adverse 
events were more frequent than seen in adult studies (5%), where discontinuations increased with 
dose. 
Death occurred in 3 cases during the observed period, in 2 cases the patients were no longer on the 
study drug at the time of death. A causal link with the study medication was not considered to be 
likely.  
The safety data observed in the current paediatric study confirmed the previously observed safety 
data in adults (prolongations in PR interval and occurrence of AV block in patients treated by ATV). 
These adverse events are dose-dependent. Therefore, since children are expected to present higher 
Cmax values than adults, this adverse event will have to be kept under close scrutiny in children. 
Forty-four (44) paediatric patients (24%) presented an AV block in this study, 26 treated with ATV 
alone (31%) and 18 treated with ATV/RTV (19%). The higher percent of AV block in patients 
treated with unboosted ATV is in line with the higher total daily doses and Cmax observed in this 
group compared to RTV-boosted ATV. 
This cardiotoxicity although even observed in adults may raise some specific concerns for the 
paediatric population insofar that: 
- 
- 
children are expected to present higher Cmax values than adults 
given that cardiotoxicity management is more likely required in the adult population than in 
paediatric population, performing a cardiac monitoring (outside specialised units) may 
reveal more complex in the paediatric clinical practice than in the adult clinical practice.   
Therefore, clear message should be given as regards the precaution to be taken before and during 
the treatment by atazanavir/RTV in children. 
The SmPC was improved to better cover the cardiac toxicity of atazanavir and the specificity for the 
paediatric population. Section 4.8 of the SmPC was revised to include the adverse events of PR 
prolongation and AV block with the relative incidence observed in adults and in children. Section 
4.4 was revised to include a warning, relative to the risk of PR prolongations and AV blocks, clearly 
differentiating both populations of adults and children. The SmPC was further updated regarding 
the precaution (cardiac monitoring) to be taken before and during the treatment with 
atazanavir/RTV in paediatric patients taking into account the cardiotoxicity of the medicinal product. 
Further update on co-administration with drugs known as also prolonging the PR. 
Hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice were seen to a similar extent as observed in adult studies.

Generally, the safety profile in children and adolescents appears similar to that in adults, although 
most AEs seem to occur with higher frequencies in this paediatric study. Comparison between the 
age brackets indicate a higher frequency of SAEs in adolescents compared to children and infants.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Dose related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with REYATAZ have 
been observed in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal 
products known to induce PR prolongations. In patients with pre-existing 
conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex 
bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the 
benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
Asymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients 
than adults. Asymptomatic first- and second-degree AV block was reported in 
paediatric patients (see section 4.8). Caution should be used with medicinal 
products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric patients with 
pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or 
complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if 
the benefits exceed the risk. Cardiac monitoring is recommended based on the 
presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia). 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction 
Calcium channel blockers:  
Bepridil: Co-administration with bepridil is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Diltiazem 180 mg QD (atazanavir 400 mg QD): No significant effect on 
atazanavir concentrations was observed. There was an increase in the maximum 
PR interval compared to atazanavir alone. Co administration of diltiazem and

REYATAZ/ritonavir has not been studied. The mechanism of diltiazem/atazanavir 
interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition. An initial dose reduction of diltiazem by 50% is 
recommended, with subsequent titration as needed and ECG monitoring. 
Verapamil: Serum concentrations of verapamil may be increased by 
REYATAZ/ritonavir due to CYP3A4 inhibition. Caution should be exercised when 
verapamil is co-administered with REYATAZ/ritonavir. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Cardiac disorders: rare: oedema, palpitation 
Vascular disorders: uncommon: hypertension; 
Paediatric population: Both asymptomatic first-degree (23%) and second-degree 
(1%) atrioventricular block were reported in paediatric patients. 
4.9 Overdose 
Human experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited. Single doses up 
to 1,200 mg have been taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic 
untoward effects. At high doses that lead to high drug exposures, jaundice due 
to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia (without associated liver function 
test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8). 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Co-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg once 
daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might 
alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and 
therefore is not recommended. 
Hyperbilirubinemia 
Reversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of 
UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving 
REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with 
elevated bilirubin in patients receiving REYATAZ should be evaluated for 
alternative etiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be 
considered if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. Dose 
reduction of atazanavir is not recommended because it may result in a loss of 
therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Indinavir is also associated 
with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia due to inhibition of UGT. 
Combinations of REYATAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-

4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction 
Indinavir: indinavir is associated with indirect unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
due to inhibition of UGT. Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and indinavir is 
not recommended (see section 4.4). 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
There are no adequate data from the use of atazanavir in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have not shown evidence of selective developmental toxicity 
or effects on reproductive function and fertility (see section 5.3). REYATAZ 
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk. It is not known whether REYATAZ administered to the mother 
during pregnancy will exacerbate physiological hyperbilirubinemia and lead to 
kernicterus in neonates and infants. In the prepartum period, additional 
monitoring and alternative therapy to REYATAZ should be considered. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Laboratory abnormalities 
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving 
regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs was elevated total 
bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated indirect [unconjugated] bilirubin 
(87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin was noted in 
37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg 
once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 
53% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. Among naive patients treated with 
REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median 
duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations (see 
section 4.4). 
Two percent of patients treated with REYATAZ experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 
ALT/AST and Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. 
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in paediatric patients 
receiving REYATAZ was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN , Grade 3-4) 
which occurred in 45% of patients.

Proposed pharmacovigilance activities 
(routine and additional) 
Proposed risk minimization activities (routine and additional) 
Among 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients 
were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving 
atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were 
co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were more likely 
to have baseline hepatic transaminase elevations than those without chronic 
viral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin elevations were observed 
between these patients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of 
treatment emergent hepatitis or transaminase elevations in co-infected patients 
was comparable between REYATAZ and comparator regimens (see section 4.4). 
4.9 Overdose 
Human experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited. Single doses up 
to 1,200 mg have been taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic 
untoward effects. At high doses that lead to high drug exposures, jaundice due 
to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia (without associated liver function 
test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8). Treatment of overdose with REYATAZ should consist of general 
supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and ECG, and 
observations of the patient's clinical status. If indicated, elimination of 
unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. 
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of 
unabsorbed drug. There is no specific antidote for overdose with REYATAZ. Since 
atazanavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein bound, 
dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicinal 
product.

4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
There are no adequate data from the use of atazanavir in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have not shown evidence of selective developmental toxicity 
or effects on reproductive function and fertility 
(see section 5.3). REYATAZ should be used during pregnancy only if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk. It is not known whether REYATAZ 
administered to the mother during pregnancy will exacerbate 
physiological hyperbilirubinemia and lead to kernicterus in neonates and infants. 
In the prepartum period, additional monitoring and alternative therapy to 
REYATAZ should be considered. It is not known whether atazanavir is excreted 
in human milk. Studies in rats have demonstrated that atazanavir is excreted in 
the milk. It is therefore recommended that mothers being treated with REYATAZ 
not breast-feed their infants. As a general rule, it is recommended that HIV 
infected women not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of 
HIV. 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is needed (see section 
5.2). REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients undergoing 
haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, 
REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients undergoing hemodialysis 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Impaired renal function: in healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged 
atazanavir was approximately 7% of the administered dose. There are no 
pharmacokinetic data available for REYATAZ with ritonavir in patients with renal 
insufficiency. REYATAZ (without ritonavir) has been studied in adult patients 
with severe renal impairment (n=20), including those on haemodialysis, at 
multiple doses of 400 mg once daily. Although this study presented some 
limitations (i.e., unbound drug concentrations not studied), results suggested 
that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were decreased by 30% to 50% 
in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal 
function. The mechanism of this decrease is unknown. (See sections 4.2 
and 4.4.)

The collaborative epidemiologic D:A:D study 
(see Table 9) is collecting safety data, 
including hepatic, in HIV-infected subjects 
treated with combination antiviral therapy. 
Patients with hepatic impairment: REYATAZ with ritonavir should be used with 
caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. REYATAZ must not be used in 
patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 
and 5.2). 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients with coexisting conditions 
Atazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma 
concentrations were observed in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 
4.2 and 4.3). The safety and efficacy of REYATAZ has not been established in 
patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic 
hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an 
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of 
concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the 
relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products (see 
section 4.8). Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active 
hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during 
combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to 
standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Impaired hepatic function: atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by 
the liver. The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
atazanavir after a 300 mg dose with ritonavir have not been studied. 
Concentrations of atazanavir with or without ritonavir are expected to be

3.5.  Overall discussion and benefit-risk assessment 
Reyataz (atazanavir) is currently only indicated in HIV infected adults in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products. Atazanavir has pharmacokinetics that allow once daily dosing in 
adults, which makes a paediatric development  program desirable as adherence could be expected to 
improve with such a regimen in this population. Also, the introduction of a formulation allowing use in 
small children would be desirable.  
The clinical development of antiretrovirals in children should focus on the dose selection. Its purpose is 
not the duplication of the clinical efficacy and safety demonstration obtained in adult patients. The 
selected dose should achieve comparable exposures in children as those observed in adults. Based on 
the underlying rational that this will lead to a comparable efficacy and safety profile of the medicine, no 
further clinical data would be required to support a positive benefit risk balance in this population.  
However, during the initial evaluation, it was concluded that the dose selection of atazanavir boosted 
with ritonavir in the MAH’s claimed paediatric indication, i.e. in children above 3 months of age, was far 
from being adequately substantiated by the MAH in support of the claimed extension of indication in 
children. Indeed, both the clinical study (AI424020/PACTG1020A) and the PPK analysis that supported 
the indication suffered from critical deficiencies. As a consequence a major objection was raised by the 
CHMP. 
The followings issues have been addressed by the MAH within the submitted responses. 
The main concern was a greater peak-to-trough ratio in children as compared to adult patients. From 
the data provided by the MAH, it was confirmed that mean Cmax values were higher, whereas mean 
Cmin values were lower in younger patients compared to older patients. However, mean AUC values 
were similar for patients in the whole age range from 6 to 13 years.  Overall, it is clear that a greater 
peak-to-trough ratio was mainly observed in the youngest children and that in patients aged 6 years 
and older, this concern was quite alleviated with a significant less higher peak-to-trough ratio. 
In response to the CHMP concern the MAH has only retained the limit of 6 years of age in its revised 
claim for the paediatric extension. Nonetheless the CHMP agreed with this proposal given the limitation 
of the data in younger children. The MAH is still encouraged to adequately develop the medicine in 
younger children than 6 years of age to answer a medical need. 
Another concern raised was the absence of clinical data to substantiate the BW-based dosing 
recommended regimen, since only BSA-based doses were investigated in the clinical study. In 
responses to this concern, the MAH provided data comparing the proposed BW-based (derived from 
the modelling/simulation) to the BSA-based doses (administered in the clinical study). Based on these 
data the BW-based dosing can be accepted, all the more that it is more convenient in clinical practice.  
As expected based on the clinical experience in adults, a much better response rate is obtained in 
antiretroviral naïve than in experienced children. This further illustrates the limitations of 
atazanavir/RTV to be used in moderately experienced patients. The benefit/risk of atazanavir/RTV in 
antiretroviral experienced paediatric patients was extensively discussed. Due to the very limited 
number of antiretroviral experienced children no clinical cut off could be determined in these patients. 
The indication was granted to allow the use of this boosted PI in some ARV experienced children (e.g. 
in children having stopped their boosted PI for intolerance or poor adherence, before having 
accumulated multiple PI resistance). However, strong warnings were included to make prescribers 
aware of the limitations of the data and results in experienced patients: “Atazanavir/ritonavir is not 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/356437/2010  
Page 50/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance. While in adults no benefit can be 
expected in patients with ≥4 PI mutations, in treatment experienced children even lower numbers of PI 
mutations may be predictive of a lack of benefit.” 
It is worth noting that when focusing on the target population of the claimed indication, i.e. children 
aged 6-18 years, it only consists of 16 antiretroviral naïve patients and 25 antiretroviral experienced 
patients (please see discussion above). The indication was revised to highlight this limited amount of 
data. Even if it is acknowledged that it is not so far from the limitation of the database for other 
boosted PIs in paediatric patients, this is nevertheless very limited and requires reinforced post-
marketing surveillance in this population (through the RMP). The MAH committed to submit a protocol 
for its involvement with the PENTA foundation cohorts to follow the paediatric population. 
Based on the clinical experience gained in adults, hyperbilirubinemia represents the most salient 
aspect of the safety profile of atazanavir. As in adults, hyperbilirubinemia accounts for the most 
frequent serious adverse event observed in children. Nevertheless, it is admitted that 
hyperbilirubinemia, although frequent, is a manageable adverse event and does not give rise to serious 
safety concerns. Of note, this nevertheless may have some potential psychosocial impact in the 
adolescent population.   
In addition to that, it is important to have a particular focus to the cardiotoxicity findings in the 
paediatric study submitted.  
Forty-four (44) paediatric patients (24%) presented an AV block in this study, 26 treated with ATV 
alone (31%) and 18 treated with ATV/RTV (19%). This appears to be more frequent than in adults. 
The higher percent of AV block in patients treated with unboosted ATV was in line with the higher total 
daily doses and Cmax observed in this group compared to RTV-boosted ATV. The safety data observed 
in the current paediatric study confirmed the previously observed safety data in adults (prolongations 
in PR interval and occurrence of AV block in patients treated by ATV). These adverse events are dose-
dependent.  
This cardiotoxicity although even observed in adults may raise some specific concerns for the 
paediatric population insofar that  
-  children are expected to present higher Cmax values than adults 
-  given that cardiotoxicity management is more likely required in the adult population than in 
paediatric population, performing a cardiac monitoring (outside specialised units) may result to 
be more complex in children in clinical practice than in adults.   
Therefore, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were revised to give a clear message as regards the 
precaution to be taken before and during the treatment by atazanavir/RTV in children.

3.6.  Changes to the product information 
Summary of Product  Characteristics 
Therapeutic indications 
Section 4.1 
The indication was extended for the treatment of HIV 1 infected paediatric patients 6 years of age and 
older in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
The indication was revised to add Reyataz co-administration with low dose ritonavir. 
A sentence was included to highlight that the indication was based on very limited data available from 
children aged 6 to less than 18 years. The indication was further amended to reflect that the clinical 
cut off (number of PI mutation) was applicable only for adults since it could not be determined for 
children.  
Section 4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This section was updated and the proposed dose of Reyataz capsules for paediatric patients is based 
on body weight. This section was revised to alert that Reyataz is not recommended in paediatric 
patients less than 6 years of age due to insufficient data on pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy. 
Furthermore, Reyataz has not been studied in children less than 3 months of age and is not 
recommended especially taking into account the potential risk of kernicterus. 
Section 4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
A strong warning was include alerting that Atazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains 
harbouring multiple mutations of resistance. While in adults no benefit can be expected in patients with 
≥4 PI mutations, in treatment experienced children even lower numbers of PI mutations may be 
predictive of a lack of benefit. 
The SmPC was improved to better cover the cardiac toxicity of atazanavir and the specificity for the 
paediatric population. This section was revised to include a warning, relative to the risk of PR 
prolongations and AV blocks, clearly differentiating both populations of adults and children. This section 
was further updated regarding the precaution (cardiac monitoring) to be taken before and during the 
treatment with atazanavir/RTV in paediatric patients taking into account the cardiotoxicity of the 
medicinal product. Further update on co-administration with drugs known as also prolonging the PR. 
Section 4.8  Undesirable effects 
This section was revised to include the adverse events of PR prolongation and AV block with the 
relative incidence observed in adults and in children and elevation of total bilirubin, the most frequently 
reported laboratory abnormality in paediatric patients. 
Section 5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
A sentence was introduced to make clear that the clinical data derived from this study are inadequate 
to support the use of atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) in children below 6 years of age. 
The information on the study was further improved and a table was inserted detailing for the 25 
antiretroviral paediatric patients the response rate depending on the number of PI mutations (as made 
for adults): 0-2; 3 and >4. 
Section 5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
This section was revised and improved with pharmacokinetic data for paediatric patients. 
The PL was updated accordingly. 
Annex II was updated with the last approved version of the RMP.

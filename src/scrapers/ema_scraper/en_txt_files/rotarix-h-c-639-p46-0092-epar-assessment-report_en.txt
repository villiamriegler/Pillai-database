1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
A stand-alone submission of the final study report for the DTPa-HBV-IPV-135 study, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The DTPa-HBV-IPV-135 study is a Phase III, randomized, 
open-label, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' 
Infanrix hexa vaccine when administered to healthy infants as primary vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 
months of age, co-administered with Prevnar and Rotarix with a booster dose of GSK Biologicals’ 
Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 months of age. The study DTPa-HBV-IPV-135 was conducted in 
the United States of America. Rotarix was co-administered to all subjects at 2 & 4 months of age. This 
study evaluates the reactogenicity and safety of this co-administration.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM  
Objectives: 
Primary: Epoch 001 (Primary vaccination): 
- 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Infanrix hexa to Pediarix co-administered with ActHIB, in 
terms of antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for pertussis antigens [pertussis 
toxoid (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN)] one month after the third 
dose of the primary vaccination.  
Criteria for non-inferiority: Non-inferiority in terms of immune response to pertussis antigens 
was to be demonstrated if, for each of the three antigens, the upper limit (UL) of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) on the GMC ratio [Pedia divided by Hexa] was ≤ 1.5.  
Secondary: Epoch 001 (Primary vaccination)  
- 
To assess the immune response to Infanrix hexa, Pediarix, ActHIB, Pentacel and Engerix-B, in 
terms of seroprotection status, seropositivity status and concentrations or titers of antibodies 
to D (Diphtheria), T (Tetanus), HBs (Hepatitis B surface antigen), pertussis, poliovirus types 1, 
2 and 3 and PRP (Polyribosyl-Ribitol- Phosphate) antigens, one month after the third dose of 
the primary vaccination.  
- 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a 3-dose primary vaccination course of Infanrix 
hexa, of Pentacel coadministered with Engerix-B, and that of Pediarix co-administered with 
ActHIB, in terms of solicited local symptoms.

- 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of all study vaccines in terms of solicited general 
events, unsolicited adverse events, new-onset chronic illnesses (NOCIs; referred to as new-
onset chronic diseases (NOCDs) in the protocol) and serious adverse events.  
Methodology:  
- 
Experimental design: Phase III, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-centric, single-
country study with five parallel groups.  
o  Epoch 001: Primary, starting at Visit 1 (Day 0) and ending at safety follow up contact 
(i.e. six months following the third dose, Month 10);  
o  Epoch 002: Booster, starting at Visit 5 (Month 13-16) and ending at Visit 6 (Month 14-
17).  
- 
Control: active controls.  
- Epoch 001: Pediarix + ActHIB and Pentacel + Engerix-B;  
- Epoch 002: Infanrix + ActHIB and Pentacel. 
A total of 585 subjetcts (6-12 weeks old at the time of first vaccine) were randomised [1:1:1]:3:3 to 5 
parallel groups and received vaccinations as follows :

Vaccination schedules:  
Epoch 001  
-  Hexa Group: Subjects in this group were to receive three doses of Infanrix hexa (lot A, lot B or 
lot C as per the group allocation) co-administered with Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months of age

o  Hexa_1 Group: Subjects were to receive lot A of Infanrix hexa; 
o  Hexa_2 Group: Subjects were to receive lot B of Infanrix hexa; 
o  Hexa_3 Group: Subjects were to receive lot C of Infanrix hexa.

- 
Pedia Group: Subjects in this group were to receive three doses of Pediarix and ActHIB co-
administered with Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and Rotarix at 2 and 4 months of 
age. 
- 
Penta Group: Subjects in this group were to receive three doses of Pentacel and Engerix-B* co-
administered with Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and Rotarix at 2 and 4 months of 
age. 
*Subjects in the Penta Group who received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine from birth up to 30 days prior to study vaccination were not 
to receive Engerix-B at 4 months of age (Visit 2). 
Epoch 002 
-  Hexa Group: Subjects were to receive a booster dose of Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 
months of age. 
- 
Pedia Group: Subjects were to receive a booster dose of Infanrix and ActHIB vaccines at 15-18 
months of age. 
- 
Penta Group: Subjects were to receive a booster dose of Pentacel vaccine at 15-18 months of 
age.

RESULTS Summary: 
Safety results : Primary Total vaccinated cohort - Safety summary 
Since Rotarix was co-administered with other vaccines, the safety analysis does not relate to the 
administration of Rotarix alone. 
Any Symptom: In all three groups (Hexa, Pedia and Penta) over the primary doses, symptoms 
(solicited and/or unsolicited, local and/or general) were reported for 93.4-96.4% of subjects.  
Solicited local symptoms: Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom reported in 
67.9% of subjects in the Hexa group, in 82.0% of subjects in the Pedia group and in 79.8% of subjects 
in the Penta group.  
Pain was also the most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited local symptom reported in 4.3% of 
subjects in the Hexa group, 18.0% of subjects in the Pedia group and 11.7% of subjects in the Penta 
group.  
Solicited general symptoms: Irritability / Fussiness was the most frequently reported solicited general 
symptom in all groups, reported in 87.7% of subjects in the Hexa group, in 96.3% of subjects in the 
Pedia group and in 94.1% of subjects in the Penta group overall. Irritability / fussiness was also the 
most commonly reported grade 3 solicited general symptom, reported for 9.6% of subjects in the Hexa 
group, 18.5% of subjects in the Pedia group and 16.0% of subjects in the Penta group overall.  
Unsolicited adverse events: At least one unsolicited symptom within the 31-day post-vaccination 
period after each vaccination was reported for 57.9%, 55.7% and 49.0% of subjects in the Hexa, Pedia 
and Penta groups, respectively. The most commonly reported unsolicited symptom in the three groups 
was Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI): Hexa group: 15.4%; Pedia group: 11.9%; Penta group: 
13.3%. Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported for 6.7%, 6.2% and 3.6% of subjects in Hexa, 
Pedia and Penta groups, respectively. The most commonly reported grade 3 unsolicited symptoms 
were: Hexa group: URTI and Otitis media (1.5%); Pedia group: URTI, Conjunctivitis and Irritability 
(1.0%); Penta group: URTI (1.0%).  
Adverse events of interest: New Onset of Chronic Illness (NOCI) symptoms were reported for 7 
subjects (3.6%) in the Hexa group, 11 subjects (5.7%) in the Pedia group and 10 subjects (5.1%) in 
the Penta group. The two reported symptoms in the Hexa group were Dermatitis atopic (2.6%) 
followed by Bronchial hyperreactivity (1.0%). In the Pedia group, the symptom reported by more than 
one subject was Dermatitis atopic (3.6%). In the Penta group, the symptoms reported by more than 
one subject were Dermatitis atopic (3.6%) and Asthma (1.0%).  
Serious adverse events: Non-fatal SAEs from Dose 1 up to 6 months following priming doses were 
reported for 7 (3.6%) subjects in the Hexa group and Penta group, and 1 (0.5%) subject in the Pedia 
group. All SAE were considered recovered/resolved without sequelae at the end of the study except 
one non-causally related event of Choking in a 47-week-old female in the Hexa group which was 
considered recovered/resolved with sequelae.  
Three SAEs occurring in two subjects were considered causally related to primary vaccination by the 
investigator: An SAE of Lethargy in an 8-week-old female subject in the Hexa group which 
recovered/resolved after one day without sequelae; 2 SAEs in the same subject: one “Apparent 
lifethreatening event” and one event of Leukocytosis were observed in a 10-week-old female subject in 
the Hexa group which recovered/resolved over 1-2 days without sequelae.

No fatal SAEs were reported during the primary vaccination Epoch of the study.  
Withdrawals due to AEs /SAEs: Two subjects had adverse events leading to premature discontinuation 
during the primary vaccination period: one Hexa group subject with an SAE of Lethargy reported after 
the first vaccination; one Penta group subject with a Non-Serious Adverse Event of Seizure reported 
after the Month 2 dose.  
Overall conclusions that relate to safety : Clinically acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in the 
different vaccination groups, aligned with the very well-known profiles of the study vaccines. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The Rapporteur agrees with the conclusions of the Applicant. The safety results of this study are in line 
with the approved SmPC for Rotarix. No updates are considered necessary. 
PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

Summary of the risk management plan for MEKTOVI 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for MEKTOVI in combination with BRAFTOVI. The 
RMP  details  important  risks  of  MEKTOVI  in  combination  with  BRAFTOVI,  how  these  risks  can  be 
minimised, and how more information will be obtained about  MEKTOVI in combination with BRAFTOVI 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
The  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  for  MEKTOVI  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how MEKTOVI should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for MEKTOVI in combination with BRAFTOVI should be read in the context of 
all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  current  concerns  will  be  included  in  updates  of  the  RMP  for 
MEKTOVI. 
I. 
The Medicine and what it is used for 
MEKTOVI  in  combination  with  BRAFTOVI  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma, with BRAF V600 mutation  (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains binimetinib and encorafenib as the active substances and both are given by the oral route of 
administration. 
MEKTOVI is not authorised for use as a single agent. 
Further information about the evaluation of MEKTOVI in combination with BRAFTOVI can be found in the 
MEKTOVI  and  BRAFTOVI  EPARs,  including  a  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website, 
under the medicine’s webpage  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/mektovi 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of MEKTOVI in combination with BRAFTOVI, together with measures to minimise such 
risks and the  proposed studies  for learning more  about  MEKTOVI  in combination  with  BRAFTOVI,  are 
outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products include:  
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the packaging of the medicine; 
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The  legal  status  of  the  medicine-  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  public  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including PSUR  assessments,  so that  immediate action can be taken  and updates made  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  MEKTOVI  in  combination  with  BRAFTOVI  are  risks  that  need  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be taken safely. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of MEKTOVI in combination with BRAFTOVI. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of these medicines is possible based on available data, 
but this association has not yet been established and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of MEKTOVI as a single agent or in combination 
with BRAFTOVI that is currently missing and needs to be collected.

Summary of important risks and missing information 
Important identified risk: Left ventricular dysfunction 
Description of 
the risk title  
Evidence for 
linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Heart problems, e.g. a drop in the amount of blood pumped by the heart. 
Left ventricular dysfunction is an identified ADR for binimetinib. Left ventricular 
dysfunction  is  a  known  effect  of  MEK  inhibitors,  a  class  of  drugs  to  which 
binimetinib  belongs.  There  is  sufficient  scientific  evidence  to  suspect  a  causal 
association between binimetinib and this risk. 
Left ventricular dysfunction, defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases 
in  ejection  fraction,  can  occur  with  binimetinib.  Left  ventricular  dysfunction, 
including ejection fraction decreased, was reported in 11.9% (51/427) of patients 
in the Bini 45 P population, and was Grade 3/4 in 4.4% (19/427) of patients. It 
was the most frequent cause of dose discontinuation, which was required in 4.2% 
of patients. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Patients  with  significant  heart  problems  were  excluded  from  the  binimetinib 
clinical trials. 
Among the patients who were included in the binimetinib clinical studies, no risk 
groups or factors have been identified. LVEF shift data were assessed in patients 
with  or  without  baseline  cardiovascular  risk  factors  (defined  as  current/ex-
smoker  and/or  history  of  hypertension,  diabetes,  hyperlipidaemia  [raised 
cholesterol],  cardiac  disorders,  arteriosclerosis  [thickening  of  the  walls  of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arteries] and ischemic heart disease [coronary heart disease]) with most patients 
having baseline risk factors. These data showed no difference in the percent of 
patients LVEF shifts for patients with worst post-baseline LVEF by baseline cardiac 
risk factor category ‘yes’ or ‘no’. 
Risk 
minimisation 
measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Dose modification recommendations in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC and relevant PIL section. 
Listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC and relevant PIL section. 
Prescription  only  medicine.  Treatment  with  binimetinib  should  be  initiated  and 
supervised  under  the  responsibility  of  a  physician  experienced  in  the  use  of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None 
Important identified risk: Haemorrhage 
Description of 
the risk title 
Evidence for 
linking the risk 
to the medicine 
A large flow of blood from a damaged blood vessel 
Haemorrhage is a known class effect of MEK inhibitors. ADRs in the grouped term 
of  haemorrhage  were  reported  as  common  for  binimetinib.  There  is  sufficient 
scientific evidence to suspect a causal association between binimetinib and this 
risk. 
In  melanoma  patients  in  the  Bini  45  P  population,  Grade  3/4  haemorrhage 
occurred in 2.3% (10/427) of patients. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Specific risk groups have not been identified based on binimetinib trials. 
Patients receiving antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications in combination with 
any  other  treatment  which  may  cause  bleeding  are  at  greater  risk  of 
haemorrhage.

Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Description of 
the risk title 
Evidence for 
linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Liver problems 
There  is  sufficient  scientific  evidence  to  suspect  a  causal  association  between 
binimetinib and this risk and abnormal liver enzymes. ALT and AST increased are 
class  effects  related  to  MEK  inhibitors  and  elevation  of  liver  enzymes  is  an 
identified ADR for binimetinib. 
In melanoma patients in the Bini 45 P population, the incidence of adverse events 
reported  as  Grade  3  or  4  increases  in  liver  laboratory  tests  among  patients 
receiving binimetinib were: 2.3% (10/427) for ALT and 2.1% (9/427) for AST. 
No case fulfilling the criteria of Hy’s law was identified. 
One case of liver failure with fatal outcome was reported in a patient receiving 
binimetinib at a high dose of 60 mg BID (dose-escalation study CMEK162X2201), 
assessed as related to binimetinib.  
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
In the binimetinib clinical studies, hepatic events were reported more frequently 
in patients with liver metastasis when compared to the overall patient population. 
In the Bini 45 P, an increase of ALT >3 × ULN (a measure of hepatic toxicity) 
was reported more frequently in patients with liver metastasis when compared 
to the overall patient population and to patients with no liver metastasis (12/131 
[9.2%], 28/414 [6.8%], and 16/283 [5.7%] patients, respectively). There were 
no other remarkable differences in liver parameters according to the presence of 
baseline metastases.

Important potential risk: Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease 
Description of the 
risk title 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Inflammation inside the lungs 
Pneumonitis is a known class effect of MEK inhibitors. There may be a causal 
association of binimetinib for this potential risk. 
In  melanoma  patients  in  the  Bini  45  P  population,  pneumonitis  events  were 
reported in 1.4% (6/427) of patients; while 0.7% (3/427) of patients reported 
Grade 3/4 pneumonitis events. 
Specific risk groups have not been identified based on binimetinib trials. 
Pneumonitis  was  reported  in  3  patients  in  Study CMEK162A2301  and  was 
associated with lung metastases in 2 patients, and history of pneumonitis was 
reported in the third patient.  
Drug-induced interstitial lung disease is reported to occur with higher frequency 
in the Asian population (Peerzada 2011).

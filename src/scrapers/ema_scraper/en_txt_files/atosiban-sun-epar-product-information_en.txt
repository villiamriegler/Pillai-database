CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Atosiban is indicated to delay imminent pre-term birth in pregnant adult women with: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
regular uterine contractions of at least 30 seconds duration at a rate of ≥ 4 per 30 minutes 
a cervical dilation of 1 to 3 cm (0-3 for nulliparas) and effacement of ≥ 50% 
a gestational age from 24 until 33 completed weeks 
a normal foetal heart rate 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment with atosiban should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the 
treatment of pre-term labour. 
Atosiban is administered intravenously in three successive stages: an initial bolus dose (6.75 mg), 
performed with atosiban 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection, immediately followed by a continuous 
high dose infusion (loading infusion 300 micrograms/min) of atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for 
solution for infusion during three hours, followed by a lower dose of atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion (subsequent infusion 100 micrograms/min) up to 45 hours. The 
duration of the treatment should not exceed 48 hours. The total dose given during a full course of 
atosiban therapy should preferably not exceed 330.75 mg of atosiban. 
Intravenous therapy using the initial bolus injection should be started as soon as possible after 
diagnosis of pre-term labour. Once the bolus has been injected, proceed with the infusion (See 
Summary of Product Characteristics of Atosiban SUN 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for 
infusion). In the case of persistence of uterine contractions during treatment with atosiban, alternative 
therapy should be considered. 
The following table shows the full posology of the bolus injection followed by the infusion:

Re-treatment 
In case a re-treatment with atosiban is needed, it should also commence with a bolus injection of 
atosiban 6.75 mg/0.9 ml, solution for injection followed by infusion with atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml, 
concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Special population 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or 
kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of 
atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used 
with caution. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of atosiban in pregnant women aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use 
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Atosiban must not be used in the following conditions: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Gestational age below 24 or over 33 completed weeks 
Premature rupture of the membranes >30 weeks of gestation 
Abnormal foetal heart rate 
Antepartum uterine haemorrhage requiring immediate delivery 
Eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia requiring delivery 
Intrauterine foetal death 
Suspected intrauterine infection 
Placenta praevia 
Abruptio placenta 
Any other conditions of the mother or foetus, in which continuation of pregnancy is hazardous 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When atosiban is used in patients in whom premature rupture of membranes cannot be excluded, the 
benefits of delaying delivery should be balanced against the potential risk of chorioamnionitis. 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or 
kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used 
with caution (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
There is only limited clinical experience in the use of atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the 
gestational age group between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The 
benefit of atosiban in these subgroups is therefore uncertain. 
Re-treatment with atosiban is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with 
multiple re-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). 
In case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of 
atosiban depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. 
Monitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of 
persistent uterine contractions should be considered. 
As an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum 
bleeding therefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus 
contraction postpartum was not observed during the clinical trials. 
Multiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and 
beta-mimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, 
atosiban should be used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration 
of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
It is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro 
investigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does 
not inhibit the medicinal product metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Interaction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female 
volunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or 
labetalol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Atosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed 
weeks of gestation.  
Breast-feeding 
If during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding should 
be discontinued during treatment with atosiban, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding 
may augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. 
In atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have 
been shown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. 
Fertility 
Embryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that 
covered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Possible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in 
clinical trials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during 
the clinical trials. The observed adverse reactions were generally of a mild severity. The most 
commonly reported adverse reaction in the mother is nausea (14 %). 
For the newborn, the clinical trials did not reveal any specific adverse reactions of atosiban. The infant 
adverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and 
beta-mimetic group incidences. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 
Atosiban SUN contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) 
which is a competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, 
atosiban was shown to bind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the 
tone of the uterine musculature, resulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also 
shown to bind to the vasopressin receptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban 
did not exhibit cardiovascular effects. 
In human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dose antagonises uterine contractions and 
induces uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine 
contractions being significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence 
(≤ 4 contractions/hour) for 12 hours. 
Phase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with 
pre-term labour at 23-33 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according 
to this labelling) or β-agonist (dose-titrated). 
Primary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered 
and not requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% 
(n=201) and 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and β-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were 
undelivered and did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the 
treatment failures in CAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by 
insufficient efficacy were significantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the 
β-agonist-treated women (n=20, 5.8%). 
In the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative 
tocolytics within 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated 
women at gestational age of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample 
(n=129 patients). 
Secondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining 
undelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and 
beta-mimetic groups with regard to this parameter. 
Mean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks 
for the atosiban and β-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU) was similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and 
ventilation therapy. Mean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 
(831) grams in the β-agonist group (p=0.58).  
Fetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the β-agonist group, 
but the clinical trials were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. 
Of the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one 
re-treatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed 
weeks has not been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group 
with atosiban is not recommended (see section 4.3). 
In a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 
(5.2%) in the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the 
15 deaths in the atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, 
although in this subgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For 
women with a gestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in 
the placebo group and 1.5% in the atosiban group). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over 
12 hours), the steady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. 
The clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. 
Absorption 
In women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), 
steady state plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion 
(mean 442 ± 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). 
Following completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (tα) and 
terminal (tβ) half-life of 0.21 ± 0.01 and 1.7 ± 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was 
41.8 ± 8.2 litres/h.  
Distribution 
Mean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 ± 6.8 litres. 
Plasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free 
fraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into 
red blood cells. 
Atosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant 
women at term, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12.  
Biotransformation 
Two metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main 
9) -29)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban 
metabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH2 
concentrations in plasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion 
respectively. It is not known whether M1 accumulates in tissues.  
Elimination 
Atosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary concentration is about 50 times lower 
than that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not known. The main metabolite 
M1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-induced uterine 
contractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6).

Patients with renal or liver impairment 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or 
kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of 
atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used 
with caution (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
It is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and 
dogs) at doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during 
the three-months toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban 
subcutaneous dose not producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic 
human dose. 
No studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction 
toxicity studies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on 
mothers and fetuses. The exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the 
human fetus during intravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of 
lactation as expected from the inhibition of action of oxytocin. 
Atosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment with atosiban should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the 
treatment of pre-term labour. 
Atosiban is administered intravenously in three successive stages: an initial bolus dose (6.75 mg), 
performed with atosiban 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection, immediately followed by a continuous 
high dose infusion (loading infusion 300 micrograms/min) of atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for

Special population 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or 
kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of 
atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used 
with caution.

The safety and efficacy of atosiban in pregnant women aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use 
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Atosiban must not be used in the following conditions: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Gestational age below 24 or over 33 completed weeks 
Premature rupture of the membranes >30 weeks of gestation

Abruptio placenta 
Any other conditions of the mother or foetus, in which continuation of pregnancy is hazardous 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When atosiban is used in patients in whom premature rupture of membranes cannot be excluded, the 
benefits of delaying delivery should be balanced against the potential risk of chorioamnionitis. 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or 
kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used 
with caution (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
There is only limited clinical experience in the use of atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the 
gestational age group between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The 
benefit of atosiban in these subgroups is therefore uncertain. 
Re-treatment with atosiban is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with 
multiple re-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). 
In case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of 
atosiban depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. 
Monitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of 
persistent uterine contractions should be considered. 
As an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum 
bleeding therefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus 
contraction postpartum was not observed during the clinical trials. 
Multiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and 
beta-mimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, 
atosiban should be used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration 
of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
It is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro 
investigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does 
not inhibit the medicinal product metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Interaction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female 
volunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or 
labetalol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Atosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed 
weeks of gestation.  
Breast-feeding 
If during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding should 
be discontinued during treatment with atosiban, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding 
may augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. 
In atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have 
been shown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. 
Fertility 
Embryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that 
covered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3).

Summary of safety profile 
Possible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in 
clinical trials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during 
the clinical trials. The observed adverse reactions were generally of a mild severity. The most 
commonly reported adverse reaction in the mother is nausea (14 %). 
For the newborn, the clinical trials did not reveal any specific adverse reactions of atosiban. The infant 
adverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and 
beta-mimetic group incidences.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 
Atosiban SUN contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) 
which is a competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, 
atosiban was shown to bind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the 
tone of the uterine musculature, resulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also 
shown to bind to the vasopressin receptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban 
did not exhibit cardiovascular effects. 
In human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dose antagonises uterine contractions and 
induces uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine 
contractions being significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence 
(≤ 4 contractions/hour) for 12 hours. 
Phase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with 
pre-term labour at 23-33 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according 
to this labelling) or β-agonist (dose-titrated). 
Primary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered 
and not requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% 
(n=201) and 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and β-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were 
undelivered and did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the 
treatment failures in CAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by 
insufficient efficacy were significantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the 
β-agonist-treated women (n=20, 5.8%). 
In the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative 
tocolytics within 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated 
women at gestational age of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample 
(n=129 patients). 
Secondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining 
undelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and 
beta-mimetic groups with regard to this parameter. 
Mean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks 
for the atosiban and β-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU) was similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and 
ventilation therapy. Mean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 
(831) grams in the β-agonist group (p=0.58).  
Fetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the β-agonist group, 
but the clinical trials were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one 
re-treatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). 
As the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed 
weeks has not been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group 
with atosiban is not recommended (see section 4.3). 
In a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 
(5.2%) in the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the 
15 deaths in the atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, 
although in this subgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For 
women with a gestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in 
the placebo group and 1.5% in the atosiban group). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over 
12 hours), the steady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. 
The clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. 
Absorption 
In women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), 
steady state plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion 
(mean 442 ± 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). 
Following completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (tα) and 
terminal (tβ) half-life of 0.21 ± 0.01 and 1.7 ± 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was 
41.8 ± 8.2 litres/h.  
Distribution 
Mean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 ± 6.8 litres. 
Plasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free 
fraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into 
red blood cells. 
Atosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant 
women at term, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12.  
Biotransformation 
Two metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main 
9) -29)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban 
metabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH2 
concentrations in plasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion 
respectively. It is not known whether M1 accumulates in tissues.  
Elimination 
Atosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary concentration is about 50 times lower 
than that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not known. The main metabolite 
M1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-induced uterine 
contractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with renal or liver impairment 
There is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or 
kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of 
atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used 
with caution (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
It is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and 
dogs) at doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during 
the three-months toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban 
subcutaneous dose not producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic 
human dose. 
No studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction 
toxicity studies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on 
mothers and fetuses. The exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the 
human fetus during intravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of 
lactation as expected from the inhibition of action of oxytocin. 
Atosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests.

6.5  Nature and contents of container  
One vial of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 5 ml solution, corresponding to 37.5 mg 
atosiban. 
Colourless tubular glass vial (type I) with bromobutyl flange grey rubber stopper and sealed with 
violet flip top aluminium seal. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The vials should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
Preparation of the intravenous infusion solution: 
For intravenous infusion, following the bolus dose, atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion should be diluted in one of the following solutions: 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
- 
Ringer's lactate solution 
- 
5% w/v glucose solution. 
- 
Withdraw 10 ml solution from a 100 ml infusion bag and discard. Replace it by 10 ml atosiban 
37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 5 ml vials to obtain a concentration of 
75 mg atosiban in 100 ml. 
The reconstituted medicinal product is a clear, colourless solution without particles. 
The loading infusion is given by infusing 24 ml/hour (i.e. 18 mg/h) of the above prepared solution 
over the 3 hour period under adequate medical supervision in an obstetric unit. After three hours the 
infusion rate is reduced to 8 ml/hour. 
Prepare new 100 ml bags in the same way as described to allow the infusion to be continued. 
If an infusion bag with a different volume is used, a proportional calculation should be made for the 
preparation. 
To achieve accurate dosing, a controlled infusion device is recommended to adjust the rate of flow in 
drops/min. An intravenous microdrip chamber can provide a convenient range of infusion rates within 
the recommended dose levels for atosiban. 
If other medicinal products need to be given intravenously at the same time, the intravenous cannula 
can be shared or another site of intravenous administration can be used. This permits the continued 
independent control of the rate of infusion.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Atosiban SUN is and what it is used for 
Atosiban SUN contains atosiban. Atosiban SUN is used to delay the premature birth of your baby. 
Atosiban SUN is used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy. 
Atosiban SUN works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) weaker. It also makes the 
contractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body 
called “oxytocin” which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Atosiban SUN 
Do not use Atosiban SUN 
- 
If you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
If you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. 
If your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 
30 weeks of your pregnancy or more. 
If your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. 
If you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered 
straight away. 
If you have something called “severe pre-eclampsia” and your doctor wants your unborn baby 
to be delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, 
fluid retention and/or protein in your urine. 
If you have something called “eclampsia” which is similar to “severe pre-eclampsia” but you 
would also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered 
straight away. 
If your unborn baby has died. 
If you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). 
If your placenta is covering the birth canal.

- 
- 
- 
- 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
If your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. 
If you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue 
with your pregnancy. 
Do not use Atosiban SUN if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). 
If you have kidney or liver problems. 
If you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. 
If you are pregnant with more than one baby. 
If your contractions start again, treatment with Atosiban SUN can be repeated up to three more 
times. 
If your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. 
Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause 
bleeding. 
If you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth 
of your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung 
oedema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). 
- 
- 
- 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist 
before you are given Atosiban SUN. 
Children and adolescents 
Atosiban SUN has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Atosiban SUN 
Tell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are 
given Atosiban SUN. 
3. 
How Atosiban SUN will be given 
Atosiban SUN will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how 
much you need. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles. 
Atosiban SUN will be given into a vein (intravenously) in three stages: 
- 
- 
- 
The first injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml will be slowly injected into your vein over one minute. 
Then a continuous infusion (drip) will be given at a dose of 18 mg per hour for 3 hours. 
Then another continuous infusion (drip) at a dose of 6 mg per hour will be given for up to

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Atosiban SUN is and what it is used for 
Atosiban SUN contains atosiban. Atosiban SUN is used to delay the premature birth of your baby. 
Atosiban SUN is used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy. 
Atosiban SUN works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) weaker. It also makes the 
contractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body 
called “oxytocin” which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Atosiban SUN  
Do not use Atosiban SUN 
- 
If you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
If you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. 
If your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 
30 weeks of your pregnancy or more. 
If your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. 
If you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered 
straight away. 
If you have something called “severe pre-eclampsia” and your doctor wants your unborn baby 
to be delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, 
fluid retention and/or protein in your urine. 
If you have something called “eclampsia” which is similar to “severe pre-eclampsia” but you 
would also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered 
straight away. 
If your unborn baby has died. 
If you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus).

If your placenta is covering the birth canal. 
If your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. 
If you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue 
with your pregnancy. 
Do not use Atosiban SUN if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN 
-

- 
If you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). 
If you have kidney or liver problems. 
If you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. 
If you are pregnant with more than one baby. 
If your contractions start again, treatment with Atosiban SUN can be repeated up to three more 
times. 
If your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. 
Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause 
bleeding. 
If you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth 
of your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung 
oedema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs).

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist 
before you are given Atosiban SUN.

Other medicines and Atosiban SUN 
Tell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are 
given Atosiban SUN. 
3. 
How Atosiban SUN will be given 
Atosiban SUN will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how 
much you need. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles.

Atosiban SUN is given intravenously in three successive stages:  
- 
The initial intravenous injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml is slowly injected into a vein over one

The total duration of the treatment should be no more than 48 hours. Further treatment cycles of 
Atosiban SUN can be used should contractions recur. It is recommended that no more than three 
retreatments should be used during a pregnancy. 
Preparation of the intravenous infusion 
The intravenous infusion is prepared by diluting Atosiban SUN 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution 
for infusion in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, Ringer's lactate solution or 5% 
w/v glucose solution. This is done by removing 10 ml of solution from a 100 ml infusion bag and 
replacing it with 10 ml Atosiban SUN 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 
5 ml vials to obtain a concentration of 75 mg atosiban in 100 ml. If an infusion bag with a different 
volume is used, a proportional calculation should be made for the preparation.  
Atosiban SUN should not be mixed with other medicinal products in the infusion bag.

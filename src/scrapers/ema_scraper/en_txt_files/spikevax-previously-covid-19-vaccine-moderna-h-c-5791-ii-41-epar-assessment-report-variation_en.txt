2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020 the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then the virus has spread globally and on 30th 
January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on 
11th March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the 
outbreak.  
According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung 
injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication and dosing administration for Spikevax are: 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 6/121 
 
 
 
 
  
• 
• 
Proposed indication: Spikevax is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 to 11 years of age  
Dosing administration: Spikevax is administered as a course of 2 (two) 50 microgram 
doses. It is recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first dose (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery but underlying health 
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic 
kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are considered risk factors for 
developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ transplantation and chromosomal 
abnormalities. Pre-existing medical conditions have also been suggested as a risk factor for severe 
disease and ICU admission in children and adolescents. 
Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to COVID-19. Individuals with high 
risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to occupation include healthcare and frontline workers.  
There are currently several vaccines approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adults and elderly, but only 
one for use in children 6-11 years old. Although COVID-19 in children is mostly a mild disease severe 
cases occur rarely. The paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome in children (PIMS or MIS-C) is a 
rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 and it can result in admission to paediatric intensive 
care in up to 70% of cases. It seems to occur more often in boys than in girls and more often in young 
children than older children or adolescents.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. It 
is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 
has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) 
proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and 
transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with 
the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin converting enzyme 
2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion with the 
cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development because it 
was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune response that 
prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. After infection 
individuals remain infectious for up to two weeks and can spread the virus even if they do not show 
symptoms.  
The median incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 7/121 
 
 
 
 
  
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
Although incidence of severe COVID-19, hospitalization and mortality is lower in children than adults, 
clinical disease of all severities occurs in children, especially in those with comorbidities and risk factors. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, 
resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically 
recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to 
recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to 
eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the 
hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU.  
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test detects RNA but 
not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. The test is 
typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or sputum 
sample. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Spikevax (also referred to in this report as COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna or mRNA-1273) is a vaccine 
approved for prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is based on nucleoside-modified mRNA 
encoding for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the 
heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. The mRNA is 
encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). 
Upon delivery and uptake by body cells the mRNA is translated in the cytosol and SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein is generated by the host cell machinery. The spike protein is presented and elicits an adaptive 
humoral and cellular immune response. Neutralizing antibodies are directed against it and hence it is 
considered a relevant target antigen for vaccine development.  
Spikevax is administered intramuscularly in two 100 µg doses given 28 days apart. The vaccine is 
currently indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 12 
years of age and older. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No scientific advice on the clinical development in children or the paediatric investigation plan was given.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

With this submission interim data of children ≥6 to <12 years of age randomised in study arms 1, 2 (both 
from open-label Part 1), 8 and 9 (both from blinded Part 2) were provided. 
Vaccine effectiveness is inferred based on demonstrating non-inferiority of the neutralising antibody 
responses compared with those obtained from young adults (≥18 to <25 years of age) enrolled in the 
ongoing adult study mRNA-1273-P301 (hereafter Study P301). Immunogenicity data from the 
comparator group of young adults in study P301 are based on a data snapshot on 8th May 2021.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Participants were enrolled at approximately 75 to 100 study sites in the United States and Canada. 
Inclusion criteria: 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 10/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all the following criteria apply: 
1.  The participant is male or female, 6 months to < 12 years of age at the time of consent/assent 
(Screening Visit), who is in good general health, in the opinion of the investigator, based on review 
of medical history and screening physical examination. 
2.  If the participant has a chronic disease (e.g., asthma, diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, human 
immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), the disease should be stable, per investigator assessment, 
so that the participant can be considered eligible for inclusion. Stable diseases are those which have 
had no change in their status or in the medications required to control them in the 6 months prior to 
Screening Visit.  
Note: a change in medication for dose optimisation (e.g., insulin dose changes), change within class 
of medication, or reduction in dose are not considered signs of instability.  
3.  In the investigator’s opinion, the parent(s)/LAR(s) understand and are willing and physically able to 
comply with protocol-mandated follow-up, including all procedures, and provide written informed 
consent and participants are willing to provide assent.  
4.  The participant is 2 years or older and has a body mass index (BMI) at or above the third percentile 
according to WHO Child Growth Standards at the Screening Visit  
5.  Female participants of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Non-childbearing 
potential is defined as premenarche. 
Special inclusion criteria for female participants who have reached menarche: 
6.  Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the participant fulfils all 
of the following criteria: 
-  Has a negative pregnancy test at Screening. Pregnancy test will be performed if deemed 
appropriate by the investigator. 
-  Has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that could result in 
pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first injection (Day 1). 
-  Has agreed to continue adequate contraception or abstinence through 3 months following the 
second injection (Day 29). 
Is not currently breastfeeding. 
Adequate female contraception is defined as abstinence or consistent and correct use of a US 
FDA-approved contraceptive method in accordance with the product label 
- 
- 
Exclusion Criteria 
Participants will be excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: 
1.  Has a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 2 weeks prior to administration of IP or known 
close contact with anyone with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 within 2 
weeks prior to administration of IP. 
2.  Is acutely ill or febrile 24 hours prior to or at the Screening Visit. Fever is defined as a body 
temperature ≥38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F. Participants who meet this criterion may have visits rescheduled 
within the relevant study visit windows. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be enrolled at 
the discretion of the investigator. 
3.  Has previously been administered an investigational or approved CoV (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, 
MERS-CoV) vaccine. 
EMA/137337/2022

5.  Has a known hypersensitivity to a component of the vaccine or its excipients. Hypersensitivity 
includes, but is not limited to, anaphylaxis or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a 
previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol 
[PEG] or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate). 
6.  Has a medical or psychiatric condition that, according to the investigator's judgment, may pose 
additional risk as a result of participation, interfere with safety assessments, or interfere with 
interpretation of results. 
7.  Has a history of diagnosis or condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect study 
endpoint assessment or compromise participant safety, specifically the following: 
- 
- 
-

Any routine vaccination with inactivated or live vaccine(s) within 14 days prior to first vaccination 
or plans to receive such a vaccine through 14 days following the last study vaccination. 
Note: This excludes influenza vaccine that may be given, however, not within 14 days prior to or 
post-Dose 1 or Dose 2. If a participant receives an influenza vaccine, this should be captured 
within the concomitant medication electronic case report form (eCRF) (Section 5.5.2). 
-

Treatments 
In the open label phase of the study (Part 1) each participant aged ≥6 to <12 years received either two 
doses of 50 µg or 100 µg of Spikevax (COVID-19 vaccine Moderna, mRNA-1273) or placebo (0.9% 
sodium chloride) by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh 28 days apart 
(i.e., Day 1 and Day 29). The protocol specified a window of +7 days for administration of the second 
dose.

1: The case definition of COVID-19 includes at least one of the following systemic symptoms: fever (temperature > 
38ºC/≥ 100.4ºF) or chills (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours), cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours), 
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours), fatigue, headache, myalgia, nasal 
congestion or rhinorrhoea, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, poor 
appetite or poor feeding, AND a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 
Immunogenicity assessment 
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be analysed for  
- 
Serum nAb titer against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by pseudovirus virus neutralisation assays.

- 
Serum bAb titer as measured by MesoScale Discovery (MSD) Multiplex assay specific to the 
SARS-CoV-2 S protein.  
For Part 1, testing for serologic markers for SARS-CoV-2 infection using the non-vaccine antigen-
based Nucleocapsid Elecsys assay at Day 1 (prior to the first dose), Day 57, Day 209, and Day 
394. 
All serological assays are considered acceptably validated for use in the assessment of clinical samples.  
Upon request the MAH confirmed that the assays used for the immunogenicity analyses are based on 
both the D614G form (neutralisation) and the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (binding). The neutralising antibody 
assay utilises lentivirus particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 D614G Spike protein. The indirect binding ECL 
assay (MSD) utilises the V-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 Panel 2 (IgG) Kit to measure IgG antibodies to three 
antigens (S, N, RBD) related to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Strain. 
COVID-19 case definition and surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for COVID-19 and on 
RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from samples collected within 72 hours of the study participant 
reporting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID-19. The participant must have at least 1 nasal swab 
(or respiratory sample, if hospitalised) positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 
Throughout the study the following pre-specified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of COVID-
19 will be elicited weekly from the participant, and the presence of any one of these symptoms (in the 
absence of an alternative diagnosis) lasting at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or respiratory 
symptoms) will result in the study site staff arranging an illness visit to collect a nasal swab for SARS-
CoV-2 within 72 hours. Case definition defined in study P204 are summarised below.

Abbreviations: bAb = binding antibody; CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID19 = coronavirus 
disease 19; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR = reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-
2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Source: Study P204 protocol amendment 4 in Module 5.3.5.1. 
Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with solicited systemic ARs that are expected after 
vaccination with mRNA-1273 (e.g. myalgia, headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7 days after 
vaccination, investigators should decide if a nasal swab should be collected. The collection of a nasal swab 
prior to the first dose on Day 1, prior to the second dose on Day 29, and then at all subsequent study 
visits (Day 43 [if visit is applicable], Day 57, Day 209, and Day 394) can help ensure that cases of 
COVID-19 are not overlooked. Any study participant who reports respiratory symptoms during the 7-day 
period after vaccination without an alternative diagnosis should be evaluated for COVID-19. 
Surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms is conducted via biweekly telephone calls or eDiary prompts as 
specified in the protocol starting after participant enrolment and continuing throughout the study. If there 
is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2 days, the study site staff will contact the study participant by 
telephone. 
Throughout the study the following pre-specified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of COVID-
19 will be elicited weekly from the participant, and the presence of any one of these symptoms (in the 
absence of an alternative diagnosis) lasting at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or respiratory 
symptoms) will result in the study site staff arranging an illness visit to collect a nasal swab for SARS-
CoV-2 within 72 hours. 
The CHMP endorsed the study objectives and endpoints. It is noted that the endpoint based on COVID-19 
‘P301 case definition’ was not specified in protocol P304 (amendment 5). 
Endpoints are in good correspondence with study objectives, concerns raised as regards adherence to 
specifics of SAP & protocol and the potential for data-driven decision-making notwithstanding. Primary 
analyses are stated to rely on study part 2 as per SAP v2.0 but the document also states: “participants in 
Part 1 and 2 of the study and in different age groups who receive the same mRNA-1273 dose level may 
be combined for analysis.” 
Co-primary immunogenicity endpoints (GMT ratio & seroresponse rate) are endorsed. Definition, as well 
as non-inferiority margin applied (in absence of established immune correlate of protection) are 
acceptable for the immunobridging concept and in line with provisions as per variant RP (indent on naïve 
population) and the approach followed for the adolescent extension.  
Understanding that 4-fold increase does not imply clinical surrogacy but ability to detect humoral 
response with sufficient certainty (i.e. technical sensitivity rather than clinical interpretability), deviating 
from 4-fold recommendation may be accepted in dependence of the specific assay used. (Nota bene: pre-
specification as per SAP states different (lower) and assay-specific fold increases as thresholds but 4-fold 
data were reported in any case (and close to 100%)). 
Efficacy endpoints are considered supportive and subject to accrual constraints based on study size and 
limited follow-up. Only descriptive summary was provided with this submission; this is considered 
acceptable. Given the uninterpretable low case accrual after complete 2-dose regimen at the time of 
readout on 6OCT, an updated readout based on a later cut-off was provided upon request.  
EMA/137337/2022

Upon request the MAH confirmed that the pseudovirus neutralisation assays is based on the D614G form 
of the Wuhan strain while the MSD is based on the Wuhan-Hu1-strain spike protein. 
For the secondary endpoint of antibody persistence over time and exploratory objectives, no outcome 
data were provided as part of this submission.  
Sample size 
The initial age groups in Part 1 were for estimation purposes. With approximately 750 participants 
(approximately 375 participants at each dose level of mRNA-1273) in the initial 6 to < 12 years age 
group, there was at least a 90% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE at a true AE rate 
of 1% for a given dose level. In each of the younger age groups (2 to < 6 years and 6 months to < 2 
years), the safety assessment was to occur during the conduct of Part 2 after approximately 375 
participants have been exposed to mRNA-1273 at the dose level selected for Part 2 by the DSMB.  
The sample size in the expansion (Part 2) was to support the safety database in the paediatric 
participants 6 months to < 12 years of age. With up to 3,000 participants each in the 6 to < 12 years, 2 
to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years of age groups exposed to mRNA-1273 at a given dose level in 
Part 2, the study had at least a 95% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE at a true 
0.1% AE rate for a given dose level. 
Sample size for immunogenicity subset 
A subset of Full Analysis Set (FAS) participants (Immunogenicity Subset) in each age group was to be 
selected for measuring immunogenicity data. The immunogenicity samples of the Immunogenicity Subset 
was to be processed, and the analysis of primary immunogenicity endpoint was to be based on the 
Immunogenicity PP Subset. Assuming approximately 25% of participants in the Immunogenicity Subset 
were not to meet the criteria to be included in the Immunogenicity PP Subset, approximately 528 
participants in Part 2 (~396 receiving mRNA-1273 and ~132 receiving placebo) were to be selected for 
the Immunogenicity Subset from which approximately 289 participants on mRNA-1273 were to be 
suitable for the Immunogenicity PP Subset. 
If a threshold of protection was available for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, with approximately 
289 participants on mRNA-1273 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset of an age group, there was to be at 
least 90% power to rule out 70% with a 2-sided 95% CI (lower bound of the 95% CI > 70%) for the 
percentage of mRNA-1273 participants exceeding the accepted threshold if the true rate of participants 
exceeding the threshold is 80%. 
If an acceptable antibody threshold of protection against COVID-19 was not available at the time of 
analysis for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, non-inferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on 
the 2 co-primary endpoints were to be performed, respectively. The sample size calculation for each of 
the 2 non-inferiority tests was performed, and the larger sample size was chosen for the study. 
With approximately 289 participants receiving mRNA-1273 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset of each age 
group in Study P204 and 289 young adults (18 to 25 years of age) from Study P301, there was to be 
90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response, as measured by the antibody GM 
value, in paediatric population at a 2
sided alpha of 0.05, compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 
years of age) in Study P301 receiving mRNA
1273, assuming an underlying GMR value of 1, a non-
inferiority margin of 0.67 (or 1.5), and a point estimate minimum threshold of 0.8. The standard 
‑
‑
deviation of the natural log
transformed levels was assumed to be 1.5.  
With approximately 289 participants receiving mRNA-1273 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset of each age 
‑
group in Study P204 and 289 young adults (18 to 25 years of age) from Study P301, there was to be at 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 17/121 
 
 
 
 
  
least 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response as measured by seroresponse 
rate in children at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, compared with that in young adults 18 to 25 years of age in 
Study P301 receiving mRNA-1273, assuming seroresponse rate of 85% in young adults of 18 to 25 years 
of age from Study P301, true seroresponse rate of 85% in children (or true rate difference is 0 compared 
to young adults from Study P301), a non-inferiority margin of 10% and a point estimate minimum 
threshold of -5% in seroresponse rate difference.  
In the 1273-P203 interim analysis (data snapshot on 8th May 2021), the observed seroresponse rates at 
Day 57 were high in both 18 to 25 years of age group from Study P301 (98.6% with 95% CI: 96.6, 99.6) 
and 12 to17 years of age group (98.8% with 95% CI: 97.0, 99.7), based on pseudovirus nAb ID50 titers. 
For this Study P204, if the true seroresponse rates were assumed to be 95% or higher in both 18 to 25 
years of age group from Study P301 and an age group in children, with between-group true difference 
within 4%, there will be a >90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority by seroresponse rate in children 
compared with 18 to 25 years of age in Study P301, at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.  
Overall, the CHMP endorsed the sample size considerations, both for the overall trial size (for safety) as 
well as for the immunogenicity subset. For a discussion on the deviation from the primary planned sample 
size for immunogenicity please see the discussion on Statistical Methods below. 
Randomisation 
Random assignment of participants in Part 2 of the study was to be based on a centralised interactive 
response technology, in accordance with pre-generated randomisation schedules. Up to 4,000 
participants each in the 6 to < 12 years, 2 to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years age groups were to 
be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to the mRNA-1273 arm (n = up to 3,000 participants in each group) or 
placebo arm (n = up to 1,000 participants in each group). 
The CHMP noted that no details on the choice of the immunogenicity subset were provided. It seems that 
the immunogenicity subset was selected post-hoc based on already positive results in Part 1 in 
comparison to the known immunogenicity results in P301. Upon request the MAH stated that all available 
immunogenicity data from Part 1 (excluding the dose-finding cohort based on the first 75 subjects per 
dose) was used for immunogenicity analyses. This is, however, not considered as “pre-specified”. With 
regard to Part 2 of the study randomisation of treatment allocation is endorsed. 
Blinding (masking) 
Part 1 of this study was planned as open label; blinding procedures were not applicable.  
Part 2 of this study was to be conducted in an observer-blind manner. The investigator, study staff, study 
participants, study site monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) were to be blinded to the IP 
administered until study end, with certain exceptions as defined in the protocol.

Analyses sets 
The following analysis sets were defined:

Immunogenicity analyses 
The primary analysis population for immunogenicity was to be the Immunogenicity PP Subset, unless 
specified otherwise. The primary objective of this study was to use the immunogenicity response to infer 
efficacy in participants aged 6 months to < 12 years at the dose level selected for expansion. For this 
objective, analyses of immunogenicity were to be performed for each paediatric age group separately at 
the selected dose level based on the participants in the Immunogenicity PP Subset. It was planned that 
for each paediatric age group, participants in Part 2 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset may be used for 
immunogenicity primary analysis. Further, participants from Part 1 and Part 2 who received the same 
mRNA-1273 dose level selected for expansion may be combined for immunogenicity analyses. If the 
same dose level was selected for expansion for more than one age group, these age groups may be 
combined for immunogenicity analyses.

If a threshold of protection against COVID-19 was available, the number and percentage of participants 
with antibody greater than or equal to the threshold at Day 57 would have been provided with a 2-sided 
95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method. For an age group, if the lower bound of the 95% CI on the 
mRNA-1273 group is > 70%, the primary immunogenicity endpoint of this study was to be considered to 
be met for that age group. The number and percentage of participants with serum antibody greater than 
or equal to the threshold with 2-sided 95% CI was to be provided at each post-baseline time point. The 
CI was to be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
If an accepted serum antibody threshold of protection against COVID-19 was not established, immune 
response as measured by GM value and seroresponse rate in each age group based on Day 57 antibody 
levels was to be compared to that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) using data from Study P301. 
An analysis of covariance model was to be carried out with antibody at Day 57 as dependent variable and 
a group variable (a paediatric age group in Study P204 versus young adults [18 to 25 years of age] in 
Study P301) as the fixed variable for each paediatric age group. The GM values of the paediatric age 
group at Day 57 will be estimated by the geometric least square mean (GLSM) from the model. The GMR 
(ratio of GM values) was to be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model. The corresponding 2-sided 
95% CI was to be provided to assess the difference in immune response between the paediatric age 
group (Study P204) compared to the young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301 at Day 57. For 
each paediatric age group, the non-inferiority of GM value was to be considered demonstrated if: 
• 
• 
The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR is > 0.67 based on the non-inferiority margin of 1.5, 
AND 
The GMR point estimate > 0.8 (minimum threshold). 
The number and percentage of participants with sero-response due to vaccination was to be provided 
with 2-sided 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method at each post-baseline time point with Day 57 
being of the primary interest. The sero-response rate difference with 95% CI at Day 57 was to be 
provided between children receiving mRNA-1273 in Study P204 and young adults of 18 to 25 years of age 
receiving mRNA-1273 from Study P301. For each paediatric age group, the non-inferiority of sero-
response rate was to be considered demonstrated if:

• 
The lower bound of the 95% CI of the sero-response rate difference is > -10% based on the non-
inferiority margin of 10%, AND 
The sero-response rate difference point estimate > -5% (minimum threshold). 
In addition, the GM value of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody with corresponding 95% CI was to be 
provided at each time point. The 95% CIs were to be calculated based on the t-distribution of the log-
transformed values then back transformed to the original scale. For each age group, the geometric mean 
fold
rise of specific nAb and bAb with corresponding 95% CI at each post-baseline time point over pre-
injection baseline at Day 1 was to be provided. Descriptive summary statistics including median, 
‑
minimum, and maximum was also to be provided.  
Multiplicity Adjustment Between Age Groups 
A sequential hypothesis testing (fixed-sequence method) was to be used to adjust multiplicity to preserve 
the family-wise Type I error rate (alpha = 0.05), starting with the oldest age group, followed by the 
middle age group, and then followed by the youngest age group.  
Interim analyses 
Part 1: Interim analyses might have been performed after all or a subset of participants (with 
immunogenicity samples collected for D1 and D57) have completed Day 57 within an age group in Part 1 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 20/121 
 
 
 
 
  
(one optional interim analysis for each age group, 3 interim analyses total for the 3 age groups in Part 1). 
Analyses of safety and immunogenicity might have been conducted at each interim analysis. 
Part 2: An interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety were to be performed after all or a subset of 
participants have completed Day 57 (1 month after the second dose) in Part 1 or Part 2 within an age 
group. This interim analysis was to be considered the primary analysis of immunogenicity for a given age 
group. Another interim analysis on safety might have been performed after a different subset or all 
participants have completed Day 57 in an age group. 
Efficacy analyses 
To evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 after vaccination with mRNA-1273 or placebo, the incidence rate 
was to be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and age group, calculated as the number of cases 
divided by the total person-time. Participants in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study and in different age groups 
who receive the same mRNA-1273 dose level (if applicable) may be combined in the analysis. 
For serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19, regardless of symptomatology or severity, 
infection rate was to be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and age group. The same analyses 
were to be conducted for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
The secondary efficacy analyses were to be performed on the PP Set, with sensitivity analyses in FAS, 
mITT Set, and mITT1 Set. Analyses of the efficacy endpoints in Part 2 were to be performed for the 
randomised blinded phase. Additional exploratory analyses were to be conducted in the blinded and 
unblinded phases for participants randomised to mRNA-1273 in Part 2, and in the unblinded phase for 
participants who are originally randomised to the placebo arm and cross-over to mRNA-1273 after use of 
any COVID-19 vaccine is authorised or licensed for the participant’s age group. 
The CHMP considered that the submitted immunogenicity data from the subset of subjects of the 
randomised blinded Part 2 phase support the application. 
Results 
Conduct of the study 
The study was amended 5 times (original protocol 24th February 2021, amendments: 30 Apr 2021, 17 
Jun 2021, 23 Jul 2021, 25 Aug 2021, 29 Sept 2021). 
Timing of the Application 
Data are available for the ≥6 years to <12 years of age group from both open-label Part 1 and blinded 
Part 2 with a data snapshot performed on 6th October 2021. This submission was triggered by 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of immunogenicity data from Part 1 participants in the ≥ 6 years to < 12-years age 
group who received the selected dose of mRNA-1273 (2x 50 μg doses, 28 days apart) 
a median 2 months of follow-up after dose 2 for at least 1,000 participants who received mRNA-1273 
at least 7 days follow-up after dose 2 for at least 3,000 participants who received mRNA-1273 with a 
median 21 days’ follow-up after dose 2. 
Another IA is planned when all participants ≥6 to <12 years reach 6 months post-dose 2, at which time 
a full CSR will be prepared; availability of the CSR and IA data is expected by Q4 2022. 
The CHMP noted that the many amendments of the study make it difficult to understand why changes in 
the primary analysis plan (including sample size plan) were not clearly reflected in the protocol. 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 21/121 
 
 
 
 
  
Upon request the MAH informed that the further safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data are collected 
per protocol and proposed to submit a further interim analysis by Q1/2022 based on a 10th November 
2021 data cut-off, meeting per protocol IA specification i.e. all participants ≥6 to <12 years in Part 2 
reach Day 57 or had discontinued the study. This is estimated to provide a median follow-up duration of 
approximately 2 months post-dose 2. These data were provided following a request for further 
information. 
Numbers analysed 
The number of participants in each analysis set for Part 1 and reasons for exclusions from the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset are presented in Table 2. Of note, the PP Immunogenicity Subset used for 
immunogenicity analyses to assess non-inferiority excludes participants whose data were used for dose 
selection. 
Table 2: Number of Participants in Each Analysis Set by Dose Level in Part 1 (FAS) 
The number of participants in each analysis set for Part 2 and reasons for exclusion from the PP Set for 
Efficacy are provided in Table 3. Approximately 11% had SARS-CoV-2 positive status or had missing 
information at baseline in each treatment group.

Study Duration and Disposition 
• 
Part 1 – open label phase 
At the time of the data snapshot (06 October 2021), 380 participants in the 50 μg group and 371 
participants in the 100 μg group received dose 1 and 379 participants in the 50 μg group and 371 
participants in the 100 μg group received dose 2 (Table 4). One (0.3%) participant in the 50 μg group 
discontinued study vaccine due to an AE of urticaria papular following dose 1. A total of 4 (0.5%) 
participants withdrew from the study. One (0.3%) participant in the 50 μg group withdrew consent. In 
the 100 μg group, 1 (0.3%) participant was lost to follow-up and 2 (0.5%) participants withdrew consent.

Percentages are based on the number of participants in the Randomization Set for Part 2. 
a. Two participants who were randomized to the placebo group received mRNA-1273 50 µg due to a dosing error. 
b. Study Vaccine Discontinuation is defined as a participant who received the first injection but did not receive the 
second injection. 
c. One participant in the mRNA-1273 group had AEs of urticaria on Day 24 and wheezing on Day 29 that were coded in 
the AE section of the eCRF as leading to discontinuation of study vaccine d. One participant in the mRNA-1273 group 
discontinued study vaccine due to physician decision due to an adverse event of rash on Day 10 (Section 2.5.6.1.4.3.2). 
One participant discontinued study vaccine due to physician decision  
e. Two participants in the mRNA-1273 group discontinued study vaccine due to withdrawal of consent: 1 denied nasal 
swab and withdrew consent and 1 no longer wanted to comply with study procedures. 
f. Two participants in the mRNA-1273 group discontinued study vaccine for other reasons; both refused vaccination. 
g. Study Completion is defined as a participant who completed 12 months of follow up after the last injection received, 
included participants who complete the first injection but not second injection. 
h. One participant in the mRNA-1273 group withdrew from study due to an AE of inflammatory bowel disease, which 
was reported 21 days after dose 2. This event was assessed as not related by the investigator.

a. One participant’s age was incorrectly entered in the database as 5 years of age. The site has confirmed that the 
participant was indeed 6 years of age at the time of informed consent. 
b. White non-Hispanic is defined as White and non-Hispanic, and Communities of Colour includes all the others whose 
race or ethnicity is not unknown, unreported, or missing. 
c. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status: Positive if there is immunologic or virologic evidence of prior COVID-19, defined as 
positive RT-PCR test or positive Elecsys result at Day 1. Negative is defined as negative RT-PCR test and negative 
Elecsys result at Day 1.

As regards baseline data, the CHMP identified no issues pertaining to selection or representativeness. 
Furthermore, patient characteristics are largely balanced between dose-selection cohort and part 1 as a 
whole. This is considered relevant in light of the question marks pertaining to the differential nAb reads 
between dose-selection and pivotal cohort. Patient characteristics are also balanced between the vaccine 
group & placebo in part 2. 
A shortcoming of the submission is the median follow-up post-dose 2 in part 2 and the related inability to 
inform (any) supportive efficacy analyses after completed primary regimen (see next section). Safety 
screening is also limited accordingly. 
The immunogenicity analysis set used for the confirmatory immunogenicity comparison was obtained 
from the expanded Part 1 50 μg group which amounted to about 50% of the newly added subjects 
consenting to voluntary d57 blood draws. See also discussion of statistical methods above for additional 
assessment of this selection approach. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Part 1 – Open-label phase 
Dose Selection 
The study began with dosing participants in the ≥ 6 to <12-year age group in Part 1 with 50 μg of mRNA-
1273. After at least 75 participants had completed Day 8, an internal safety team reviewed the available 
safety data and agreed with the prespecified protocol plans to proceed with the 100 μg arm in Part 1 in 
the ≥6 to <12-year age group. 
Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status was determined as positive if there is immunologic or virologic evidence of 
prior COVID-19, defined as positive RT-PCR test or positive Elecsys result at Day 1. All subjects in the 
dose definition phase were found negative at baseline.

Table 11 displays a summary of the nAb responses in children aged ≥6 to < 12 years old having received 
either two 50 µg or two 100 µg vaccine doses 28 days apart. In the 50 µg vaccine dose group the nAb 
GMT (measured by PsVNA ID50) was 1204.6 (95% CI: 1047.2, 1385.8) 28 days after dose 2 while in the 
100 µg vaccine dose group a GMT of 1887.7 (95% CI: 1606.5, 2218.2) post-dose 2 was determined. All 
children achieved at least a 4-fold increase in nAb titers. The GMFR was 130 and 196 in the 50 µg and 
100 µg dose group, respectively.

A review for dose selection compared the GM nAbs and seroresponse rate of the ≥6 to <12 years of age 
dose selection PP Immunogenicity Subset 50 μg as well as the 100 µg group in Study P204 with those 
from previously generated results of the immunogenicity subset of ≥18 to <25-year-old participants in 
the pivotal Study P301.  
In children ≥6 to < 12 years old in the 50 µg dose group, the nAb GMT was 1204.647 at Day 57, 28 days 
after dose 2 (Table 12). All children achieved a seroresponse based on a 4-fold increase from baseline. 
The GMR of the paediatric 50 μg group (n=67) to young adult group (n=296) nAb titers at Day 57 was 
0.93 (95% CI 0.74, 1.16). The difference in seroresponse rates between children and young adults at Day 
57 was 1.4% (95% CI: -4.1%, 3.4%). The GMR of paediatric 100 μg group (n=57) to young adult group 
(n=296) nAb titers at Day 57 was 1.45 (95% CI 1.15, 1.84). The difference in seroresponse rates 
between children (Study P204) and young adults (Study P301) at Day 57 was 1.4% (95% CI: -5.0%, 
3.4%).

Based on the combined assessments of safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and immunogenicity, the 50 µg 
dose was selected for further evaluation in Part 2 (randomised, placebo-controlled portion) of Study P204 
in the ≥6 to <12-year age group. 
Immunogenicity assessment and non-inferiority analysis 
Results provided for the PP Immunogenicity Subset from Part 1 consist of all available data from the 50 
μg group up until data snapshot (06 October 2021), excluding data from the dose-finding immunogenicity 
subset (n=67).  
Table 13 summarises the analysis of serum nAb levels at Day 57 for children ≥6 years to < 12 years of 
age in Study P204 compared with those at Day 57 for young adults aged ≥18 to <25 years in Study 
P301. One P301 participant had HIV and was included in the P301 young adults Per Protocol 
Immunogenicity Subset (n=296) due to interference of active antiretroviral therapy with the assay.  
In the PP Immunogenicity Subset (n=134), baseline nAb GMT in children ≥6 years to < 12 years old in 
Study P204 was below the LLOQ and GMT was 1964.6 (95% CI 1722.3, 2240.9) at Day 57, 28 days after 
dose 2, with 99.3% of children achieving seroresponse. The GM fold-rise from baseline at D57 was 209.4 
(95% CI: 182.9, 239.8).  
The pre-specified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective are met based on the co-
primary immunogenicity endpoints. The immunobridging in children ≥6 to <12 years old in Study P204 is 
demonstrated as compared with young adults in Study P301. The GMR of nAb titers at Day 57 of children 
≥6 to <12 years of age compared with young adults was 1.510 (95% CI: 1.263, 1.804), meeting the 
non-inferiority success criterion (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥0.67). In addition, the 
criterion on the point estimator of GMR >0.8 was also met. The difference in seroresponse rates between 
children and young adults at Day 57 was 0.6% (95% CI: -2.8%, 2.8%), meeting the non-inferiority 
success criterion (lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference is > -10%).

Assessment of the PsVNA results applying a cut-off of 80% inhibitory dose (ID80), showed similar results 
with a GMR of paediatric participants to young adults at Day 57 of 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.5) and difference 
in seroresponse rate again of 0.6% (95% CI: -2.8%, 2.8%) (data not shown). Anti-Spike bAb assay data 
using the MSD platform confirmed the findings of the analyses based on the PsVNA ID50 assay (Data not 
shown).  
Immunogenicity results based on Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset samples 
In both the dose-finding (N=67) and final analyses (N=134), immunogenicity of the 50 μg dose among 
children ≥6 to <12 years of age was significantly different to young adults in Study P301 using the PsVNA 
(0.9 vs 1.5). Upon request Day 57 immunogenicity analysis based on Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset 
samples were provided. The part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset is a subset with n=320 (close to the 
sample size of 289 specified in the protocol for the non-inferiority testing of the coprimary endpoints) 
derived from the blinded, placebo-controlled phase of the study and serves as the primary analysis pre-
specified to infer the effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in children. 
As shown in Table 14 the Day 57 nAb GMT (measured by PsVNA ID50) was 1610.2 (95% CI 1,456.6, 
1,780.0; n=319) with 99.1% of children achieving seroresponse. The GMFR in nAb from baseline to D57 
was 174.0 (95% CI: 157.2, 192.5). The GMT of 1,610.2 from this larger Part 2 PP Immunogenicity 
Subset falls between that observed for the Part 1 dose-selection subset (1204.6: 95% CI: 1,047.2, 
1,385.8; n=67) and for the Part 1 PP Immunogenicity Subset (1964.6, 95% CI: 1,722.4, 2,240.9; 
n=134).  
As specified in the clinical P204 protocol, immunobridging between the paediatric population and the adult 
efficacy population was to be performed based on the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset in study P204. 
Results from this subset successfully met non-inferiority criteria for both GMR and seroresponse rate 
difference compared to young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal P301 study. Comparison of GMT 
between the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset in P204 and the PP Immunogenicity Subset of young 
adults in P301 shows a GMR of 1.239 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.432) and a SRR difference of 0.1 (95% CI: -1.9, 
2.1). These measures both successfully meet NI criteria of the 50 µg mRNA- 1273 in children 6 to <12 
years compared to young adults receiving 100 µg of mRNA-1273.

• 
Efficacy Analyses for Endpoints Starting 14 Days After Dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy 
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases occurring 14 days or more after dose 2 in the PP 
Set for Efficacy were secondary endpoints.  
Based on the PP Set for Efficacy (data cut-off 6 Oct), there was 1 case (0.1%) of COVID-19 in the placebo 
group (incidence rate 8.58 per 1000 person-years) and none in the mRNA-1273 group starting 14 days 
after dose 2. The case in the placebo group met both the CDC case definition of COVID-19 and the P301 
case definition of COVID-19. There were no cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in either 
treatment group starting 14 days after dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy.  
Upon request the MAH provided data from the secondary efficacy endpoint from an IA based on 10th 
November 2021. This data cut-off was triggered based on meeting per protocol IA specification (all 
participants 6 to <12 years in Part 2 reaching Day 57 or having discontinued the study). In addition, 
availability of an EUA allowed unblinding of any study participant and cross-over of placebo participants to 
either receive mRNA-1273 or withdraw from trial and seek the approved vaccine as specified on protocol 
P204.  
Given a median follow-up of 82 days after dose 1 and 51 days after dose 2 in Part 2 blinded phase, 
efficacy endpoints accumulated after the first of the two doses (i.e. occurring starting 14 days PD1 and 
measured in the mITT1 population) greatly outnumber the efficacy endpoints accumulated after the 
intended, two-dose regimen (i.e. starting 14 days PD2). As shown in the table 15 below, limiting endpoint 
analysis to endpoints occurring 14 days PD2 (i.e. after the intended regimen) yield a total of only 7 cases. 
The estimated VE based on the incidence rate was 76.8% with a 95% CI of -0.373 to 0.966 (reference to 
Table 14.2.8.1.1.2). Similar results were obtained for the other endpoints, too few to perform meaningful 
analyses. It should be noted that during the study period and in the region where the study was 
conducted the Delta variant prevailed.

Efficacy Analyses for Endpoints Starting 14 Days After Dose 1 in the mITT1 
Table 16 summarises the descriptive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases occurring at 
least 14 days after dose 1 in the mITT1 (data cut-off 6 Oct). The analyses of efficacy were conducted in 
baseline PCR and Elecsys negative participants. 
VE analyses were conducted using the COVID-19 “CDC case definition,” requiring only 1 symptom and 
reflecting the less severe disease, which is more common in paediatric patients, and a positive RT-PCR. 
The VE against cases occurring 14 days or more after dose 1 was based on 3 cases (0.1%) in the mRNA-
1273 group and 14 cases (1.6%) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 93.0% (95% CI: 75.1%, 
98.7%). Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms occurring 14 days or more after dose 
1 showed a VE of 80.1% (95% CI: 61.5%, 90.0%) based on 16 cases (0.6%) in the mRNA-1273 group 
and 26 cases (3.0%) in the placebo group.

Based on the mITT1 population (VE starting 14 days post-dose 1) a total of 25 cases were accrued in the 
longer follow-up period with data cut-off on 11th November (Table 17). This allowed a more robust 
calculation of vaccine efficacy. The incidence of COVID-19 using the CDC case definition was 117/1000 
person years in the placebo group compared to 14/1000 person years in the vaccine group, yielding a 
vaccine efficacy (VE) of 88% (95% CI: 70.0%, 95.8%). Using the same case definition employed in the 
pivotal adult efficacy trial of mRNA-1273, a VE of 91.8% was observed (95% CI: 74.2, 98.0%).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study mRNA-1273-P204 is a 2-part phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, 
and effectiveness of Spikevax in healthy children 6 months to less than 12 years of age separately in 3 
different age groups (6 to < 12 years, 2 to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years). The modified PIP 
including changes to the randomisation in study P204 was approved by PDCO (EMEA-002893-PIP01-20-
M01). In the first open label part two doses of Spikevax in a concentration of 50 µg and of 100 µg were 
evaluated in children aged ≥6 to <12 years. In the subsequent randomised (3:1), observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled expansion study the chosen 50 µg dose level was further evaluated. The study was 
amended 5 times.  
The sample size of both, Part 1 and Part 2 were increased during the study to allow a better safety 
assessment. Planned sample sizes for safety as well as immunogenicity are overall endorsed.

Page 39/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The analyses and analysis sets are not always unambiguously defined. For example, it is often not clear 
to which part of the study they belong to. The immunogenicity subset to be used for immunobridging was 
not well defined. No clear definition and separation between age groups and study parts (Part 1: dose 
finding, Part 2: dose confirmation) exists making the overall study plan rather vague. The MAH even 
potentially planned to combine data over age groups if the same dose was to be chosen. This is 
acceptable as supportive evidence but not endorsed as primary analysis.  
The study plan for interim and final immunogenicity analyses is very vague and the timing of the primary 
analyses remains unclear. According to the protocol it seems that immunobridging was planned based on 
Part 2 of the study, which also is in line with the two-stage design (dose selection, dose confirmation). 
This was widened with a statement that “an interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety will be 
performed after all or a subset of participants have completed Day 57 (1 month after the second dose) in 
Part 1 or Part 2 within an age group. This interim analysis will be considered the primary analysis of 
immunogenicity for a given age group.” This is not fully understood in the light of the definition of interim 
analyses for Part 1 where it is stated that “Interim analyses may be performed after all or a subset of 
participants (with immunogenicity samples collected for D1 and D57) have completed Day 57 within an 
age group in Part 1 (one optional interim analysis for each age group, 3 interim analyses total for the 3 
age groups in Part 1).” It is not assumed that only a first (optional) interim analysis in Part 1 would have 
been considered primary by the MAH at planning stage. Hence, no clear concept for interim and primary 
analysis was in place, which is not endorsed for a confirmatory trial.  
Dose selection 
In part 1 of study P204 two doses of Spikevax in a 50 µg and 100 µg concentration, respectively were 
evaluated in 75 subjects each. Although higher nAb levels were achieved in the 100 µg dose group 
compared with the 50 µg dose group (1,887.7 vs 1,204.6) all subjects in both dose selection groups 
reported a 4-fold increase in antibody titers based on the PP set. Comparison of the neutralising antibody 
responses of each of the two dosing groups with the nAb responses reported in young adults (≥18 to <25 
years of age) showed a 0.93 and 1.45 fold difference in geometric mean ratio in the 50 µg and 100 µg 
dose group, respectively, indicating an increase in dose response with increasing concentrations. With 
respect to immunogenicity both concentrations result in an appropriate neutralising antibody response. 
Based on the reactogenicity profile the 50 μg dose was chosen for further evaluation in the ≥6 to <12-
year-old participants in the subsequent randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled part 2 of the 
study. The dose selection process – as conducted - was not pre-specified in the protocol which foresaw 
separate study parts for dose selection and confirmation. It was however confirmed that the enrolment of 
participants in the dose selection cohort occurred independent of the subsequent enrolment of the 
enlarged part 1 subjects for additional Part 1 safety and immunogenicity. Enrolment of these subsets 
occurred at non-overlapping time windows. While at the time of dose selection safety/tolerability data 
(post-dose 2) were available for participants receiving 50 µg or 100 µg mRNA-1273 in the dose selection 
part, immunogenicity data were only available for the 50 µg group in the expanded part 1 subjects. 
Consequently, the decision to carry the 50 μg dose forward to Part 2 occurred independent of 
immunogenicity data from the 100 μg Part 1 expansion cohort. As regards safety it was confirmed that 
data from both the 50 µg and the 100 µg dose arm were available and consequently, data from the 
expansion cohort could in fact have been factored into the dose selection. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Inferring efficacy by immunobridging from adults to children is an accepted strategy for vaccines and has 
been applied previously. Since no serological correlate of protection is currently established non-inferiority 
analyses based on antibody levels and response rates following vaccination are recommended. Antibody 
EMA/137337/2022

responses in children and young adults following vaccination with Spikevax were assessed using two 
different serological assays to measure anti-spike binding and neutralising antibodies. As demonstrated in 
in vitro studies and in vivo using monoclonal antibodies, neutralising antibodies against the spike protein 
play a crucial role in the prevention of COVID-19. Hence, results of the analyses of neutralising antibody 
responses are key to establish non-inferiority and to conclude on the acceptability of immune bridging.  
The immune bridging strategy to infer vaccine efficacy was based on a non-inferiority approach 
employing ratios of geometric mean titers (GMR) and seroresponse rates between children ≥6 to <12 
years of age from study P204 and young adults ≥18 to <25 years of age from study P301. Evaluations 
were based on neutralising antibody (nAb) titers measured via PsVNT (ID50) at day 57 post-vaccination 
(Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Subset) and a 4-fold increase criterion.  
The analysis presented for immunobridging was initially only based on Part 1 data and contained data on 
the 134 subjects which were not part of immunogenicity analyses for dose selection. This is far less than 
the originally planned 289 subjects for the PP immunogenicity set. The MAH clarified upon request that 
the “deviation from the original protocol was considered appropriate based on the emergence of the Delta 
variant in summer 2021, increased pediatric hospitalization and concern for the overall well-being of 
school-aged children”. This is in principle endorsed. A timely protocol or SAP amendment reflecting this 
decision would have been preferred, though. The decision to conduct the primary immunogenicity 
analysis using only data from Part 1 was made based on the results in the dose selection cohort without 
knowledge of the immunogenicity data in the additional 134 subjects from Part 1.  
Significant differences in GMTs were observed in children participating in the 50 µg group of the dose 
selection part and in the analyses of non-inferiority (1,204.6 vs 1,964.6) in the expanded immunogenicity 
set of part 1. If compared to young adults the observed discrepancy between dose-selection and the 
expanded ≥6 to <12 years of age immunogenicity cohorts was of concern. To exclude variability of the 
assay as root cause further information on assay performance was provided. A review of internal control 
parameters and data on assay control samples indicated that the assay performed within its validation 
parameters. Moreover, the MAH confirmed that there were no changes to the assay conduct or reagents 
used. Potential other sources for the observed differences in nAb GMT were discussed, however, no final 
conclusion on the root cause of these differences can be made for the time being although smaller sample 
size and lack of random selection of the serum samples likely contribute to the observation. 
Upon request the MAH also provided further immunogenicity analyses from the (blinded) part 2 PP 
immunogenicity subset (N=319). An increase of neutralising antibodies was reported in children aged ≥6 
to <12 years of age 4 weeks after the recommended adult vaccination schedule of 2 doses given 28 days 
apart. In SARS-CoV-2 baseline negative individuals the neutralising antibody (nAb) levels were 1.5 fold 
higher in part 1 subjects and 1.2 fold higher in the larger cohort of part 2 subjects compared with the nAb 
levels observed in young adults included in the PP immunogenicity set in the pivotal efficacy study P301. 
Almost all children in part 1 (133/134) and part 2 (313/316) achieved at least a 4-fold increase in nAb 
titers after two doses of 50 µg Spikevax given 28 days apart indicating an appropriate seroresponse. Non-
inferiority was demonstrated by comparison of the antibody responses in children (part 1 and part 2) to 
young adults. The results met the pre-specified success criteria in the neutralising antibody levels (part 1: 
1.51; 95%CI: 1.263, 1.804; part 2: 1.239; 95% CI: 1.072, 1.432) and the seroresponse rates (part 1: 
0.6; 95%CI: -2.8, 2.8; part 2: 0.1; 95%CI: -1.9, 2.1). Analyses based on a binding anti-Spike antibody 
assays confirmed these results, i.e. non-inferiority of bAb responses and response rates were established.  
Lower bounds of CIs of the pivotal immunogenicity sample are well above the pre-specified margins, and 
direct comparisons of point estimates of GMT and SR between ≥6 to 12 years of age and young adults 
would support the assumption that immune response in children is at least as strong as in young adults.  
Despite the differences in nAb results the success criteria for immunobridging of children ≥6 to <12 years 
to young adults in P301 were met for the various data sets (dose selection group and expanded

immunogenicity subset of part 1). Immunogenicity analysis from a larger number of subjects who 
received the 50 µg dose of Spikevax or placebo in the blinded randomised part 2 of study P204 confirmed 
these initial results.  
Vaccine efficacy was assessed as secondary endpoint in the second part of the study. In children tested 
SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline and having received two doses of 50 µg Spikevax 28 days apart only 4 
confirmed COVID-19 case in the placebo group and 3 cases in the vaccine group was reported 14 days 
post-dose 2 (data cut-off date 11 Nov). In the mITT set VE against COVID-19 starting 14 days after dose 
1 was estimated to be 88% (95% CI: 70.0%, 95.8%) based on a total of 25 cases accrued (7 in the 
Spikevax group and 18 in the placebo group). Using the same case definition employed in the pivotal 
adult efficacy trial of mRNA-1273, a VE of 91.8% was observed (95% CI: 74.2, 98.0%). 
Because of the very low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the short follow-up period of a median 
of 51 days post-dose 2 no reliable VE estimates are available. As SARS-CoV-2 infections in children are 
mostly mild and asymptomatic this is not unexpected. 
In summary, and mainly building on the co-primary immunobridging endpoints, efficacy against 
symptomatic COVID-19 could be inferred for children ≥6 to <12 years of age. 
2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From the interim data available, it can be concluded that Spikevax protects children aged ≥6 to <12 
years against symptomatic COVID-19 based on demonstration of non-inferior humoral immune responses 
compared to young adults ≥18 to <25 years. Outstanding issues were addressed appropriately and 
further immunogenicity results from the blinded part 2 study cohort were presented. These data support 
the interim results on immunobridging.  
The CHMP considers the following measure (SOB) necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy:  
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy of Spikevax, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report 
for the randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study mRNA-1273-P204. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
On 6th January 2021, Spikevax (also referred to in this report as COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna or mRNA-
1273) was granted a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU for active immunisation to prevent 
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. On 23rd July 2021, the 
indication was subsequently extended to individuals ≥12 years of age (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021). This 
procedure intends to extend the use of Spikevax to include active immunisation to prevent coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in individuals 6 years to <12 years of age. The safety assessment for the 
extension of indication of Spikevax to individuals 6 years to < 12 years of age is based on the submitted 
safety data for study mRNA-1273-P204 (hereafter referred to as P204). P204 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, 2-
part, open-label, dose-escalation, age de-escalation and subsequent randomised, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and effectiveness 
of mRNA-1273 in healthy children 6 months to less than 12 years of age. The study population in P204 
comprises 3 age groups (6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years). This 
submission focus on children 6 years to < 12 years of age as mentioned above. Subjects in this age 
cohort were recruited in the USA during predominance of the Delta variant. Main exclusion criteria were 
hypersensitivity against any component of the vaccine, liver disease, congenital or acquired

immunodeficiency and bleeding disorders. The open-label dose selection Part 1 is evaluating up to 3 dose 
levels (25, 50, and 100 μg) of mRNA-1273 in each age group. It should be noted that the 25 µg dose was 
not tested in the age group 6 to < 12 years of age. In the blinded expansion phase (Part 2), participants 
receive mRNA-1273 or placebo administered as 2 IM injections approximately 28 days apart at the 
selected dose level. 
Prior to the start of Part 2 Protocol Amendment 3 was implemented including enhanced surveillance for 
symptoms suggestive of possible myocarditis or pericarditis, based on individual symptoms that are 
components of the US CDC working case definition for myocarditis and pericarditis observed following 
COVID-19 vaccination (Gargano et al 2021). 
Data snapshot for this analysis is 6th October 2021. 
Study population  
Children with chronic disease (e. g., asthma, diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, human immunodeficiency 
virus infection) were not excluded in the trial, but the disease should be stable. Stable diseases were 
defined in the CTP as those which have had no change in their status in the medications required to 
control them in the 6 months prior to Screening Visit. Literature indicates that obesity in adults is 
associated with worse outcomes in COVID
19. There is a paucity of clinical data available to fully 
understand the risk factors and disease course in the paediatric population. In Part 1 of the trial, in both 
dose groups together, 14 children (1.9%) were obese with BMI>= 30 kg/m2; 6 each in mRNA-1273 and 
‑
the placebo group (2.1% versus 1.6%). The proportion of obese versus non-obese participants in both 
vaccine groups together in part 1 was 22.5% (169 children) versus 77.5% (582 children). In part 2 of the 
trial, 193 children (19.4%) in the placebo and 607 in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group (20.2%) were obese. 
The proportion of obese/non-obese children in the 50 µg dose group, taking part 1 and part 2 together 
was 20.5% (696) obese versus 79.5% (2691) non-obese children. This is comparable to the proportion in 
the placebo group (19.4% obese children versus 80.6% non-obese children). With regard to medical 
history the placebo and the vaccine group in P204 were balanced, taking the 50 µg vaccine group of part 
1 and part 2 together. At least one medical history was reported by 53.5% of subjects in the placebo and 
by 55.8% of subjects in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group of part 1 and part 2 together (table 
14.1.4.1.2). The most recorded medical histories belong to the SOC of immune system disorders (26.4% 
of subjects in the placebo and 28.3% in the 50 µg vaccine group). This included amongst other medical 
conditions seasonal allergy (21.0% versus 21.7%), drug hypersensitivity (3.7% each), one case of 
selective IgA immunodeficiency and 4 HIV positive children enrolled in the 50 µg vaccine group. This was 
followed by psychiatric disorders (14.6% versus 13.0% of subjects in the placebo and the vaccine group). 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported by 0.5% and 0.8% of subjects in the two groups. 
This included individual cases of thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, mast cell activation 
syndrome, anaemia, and neutropenia, all in the vaccine group. Metabolism and nutrition disorders were 
reported by 1.8% each (again taking the 50 µg group of part 1 and part 2 together). This included 0.5% 
versus 0.2% of subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 (5 versus 8 subjects), and singular cases of 
metabolic syndrome and glucose tolerance impaired in the vaccine group. 0.1% (1 subject) in the placebo 
versus 0.3% of subjects (11) in the vaccine group had a history of cardiac disorders. 3 subjects with 
autoimmune thyroiditis were enrolled in the vaccine group. One subject in a vaccine group had a medical 
history of acute lymphocytic leukaemia.  
Individuals with known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 2 weeks prior to administration of IP or 
known close contact with anyone with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 within 2 
weeks prior to administration of IP were to be excluded, but SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline was 
not an exclusion criterion. In Part 1 of the trial, 86.1% of participants in the 50 µg and 86.8% in the 100 
µg dose group were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, 7.4% versus 8.1% were seropositive, and 
from 6.6% and 5.1% of participants in the 50 µg and the 100 µg dose group, the SARS-CoV-2 baseline 
EMA/137337/2022

status is not known. The proportion was comparable in Part 2, were 89.5% of participants in the mRNA-
1273 and 88.2% in the placebo group were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative, and 8.5% versus 8.7% 
seropositive. From 1.9% and 3.0% of participants in the two groups in Part 2 the SARS-CoV-2 baseline 
status is not known. 
The CHMP noted that fewer data with regards to risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcome are available 
for the paediatric population compared to the adult population. Limited data suggest an increased risk of 
severe or critical disease in children less than one year of age and those with certain underlying medical 
conditions like e.g. congenital heart disease, and chronic pulmonary disease. The trial includes only 
individuals who are in a good health. Children with stable chronic underlying disease were however 
allowed to be enrolled into the trial. The proportion of obese/non-obese children in the 50 µg vaccine 
group (part 1 and part 2 together) was 20.5% obese versus 79.5% non-obese. This is comparable to the 
proportion in the placebo group (19.4% obese children versus 80.6% non-obese children). At least one 
medical history was reported by 53.5% of subjects in the placebo and by 55.8% of subjects in the 50 µg 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group (taking part 1 and part 2 together). 
Patient exposure and duration of follow-up 
First interim analysis with data cut-off 6th October 2021 
The data cut-off for the first interim analysis submitted to support the extension of indication to children 
6-<12 years of age was 6th October 2021. For this cut-off, the safety sets include data from 4753 
participant (data snapshot 6th October 2021), including 3,758 participants who received at least 1 dose of 
either 50 µg or 100 μg mRNA-1273 and from 995 participants who received at least 1 dose of placebo. 
The size of the submitted safety database supports detection of an AE occurring at a rate of 0.1% with a 
95% probability. Overall, 1,374 participants had received at least one dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273, which is 
the final selected dose for the paediatric population 6-<12 years of age.  
At the data snapshot performed on 6th October 2021, in Part 1, the median duration of follow-up was 140 
days for the 50 μg group (n=380) and 135 days for the 100 μg group (n=371) after dose 1, and 111 
days for the 50 μg group (n=380) and 106 days for the 100 μg group after dose 2 (n=371). In Part 2, the 
median follow-up post-dose 2 was 21 days for the 50 µg group and 20 days for the placebo group. At the 
time of data snapshot, no participants had been followed for ≥ 56 days after the second dose. A safety 
follow-up of at 28 days after dose 2 was performed for 853 participants who had received at least one 
dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. Safety follow-up for 3 months post-dose 2 was provided for 749 subjects who 
had received at least one dose of either 50 µg or 100 µg mRNA-1273 (in Part 1). 379 children in the 50 
µg group in Part 1 provided at least 56 days of follow-up, and only 474 children in the 50 µg group of Part 
2 provide at least 28 days post-dose 2. The time-window foreseen for collection of unsolicited AEs, SAEs, 
MAAEs, AESIs is up to 28 days after each injection, this means that a meaningful short term follow-up is 
only available for a minority of subjects, i.e. 18.8% in the main Part 2. An overview of the sample size 
and duration of follow-up for Part 1, Part 2 and for Part 1 and Part 2 together (i.e. for the 100 µg and the 
50 µg dose recipients) is provided in Tables 19, 20 and 21.

Upon request, the MAH submitted additional safety data from a protocol specified Interim Analysis (IA) 
performed on 10th November 2021, at the time at which each participant according to the protocol had 
either completed study Day 57 or had discontinued study.  
For the part 2 trial follow-up it must be considered, that on 29th October 2021, a competitor’s COVID-19 
vaccine became available for that age group via EUA by the FDA. Per Protocol Amendment 5, if a child 
becomes eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine outside of the study, it becomes eligible to unblind and, if having 
received placebo, also eligible to receive comparator vaccine or to cross-over to receive 2 doses of mRNA-
1273. Unblinding and cross-over vaccinations for the 6 to <12-year-old age group in Part 2 started on 1st 
November 2021, 9 days before the data cut-off date for the pre-specified IA, marking the ending of the 
blinded follow-up for this age group. Data collected after participant unblinding are not included in the 
blinded phase analyses. Only 80 /1000 placebo participants have left the trial to date to seek an 
alternative vaccine. The vast majority of placebo recipients have crossed over to mRNA-1273 and 
contribute to additional safety follow-up, albeit unblinded. 
Duration of follow-up in the 2nd IA 
In Part 1, post-dose 1 the median duration of follow-up was 175 and 170 days, respectively, for the 50 
and the 100 μg groups, post-dose 2 it was 146 and 141 days, respectively for the 2 dose groups.  
379 (99.7%) participants in the 50 μg group and 370 (99.7%) participants in the 100 μg group have 
been followed for 2 months (56 days) or more after dose 2. 
In Part 2, the median duration of follow-up was 82 days after dose 1 and 51 days after dose 2 in the 
blinded phase prior to unblinding or cross-over. In Part 2 blinded phase, 2981 (99.1 %) participants in 
the mRNA-1273 group and 966 (97.1 %) participants in the placebo group have been followed for 28 
days or more after dose 2. In the blinded phase, 1066 (35.5%) participants in the mRNA-1273 group and 
218 (21.9%) participants in the placebo group have been followed for 56 days or more after dose 2.

Table 22: Summary of Study Duration in Part 2 Blinded Phase (Safety Set), source: Table 3 response 
document 
Taking blinded phase and open-label phase together, there are 2984 (99.2 %) participants in the mRNA-
1273 group and 967 (97.2 %) participants in the placebo group who have been followed for 28 days or 
more after dose 2. 1498 (49.8%) participants in the mRNA-1273 group and 456 (45.8%) participants in 
the placebo group have been followed for 56 days or more after dose 2. 
The CHMP noted that the first data snapshot supporting the extension of indication to the paediatric 
population from 6-<12 years of age is 6th October 2021. The safety sets include data from 4,753 
participant (data snapshot 6th October 2021), including 3,758 participants who received at least 1 dose of 
either 50 µg or 100 μg mRNA-1273 and from 995 participants who received at least 1 dose of placebo. 
Overall, 3,387 participants had received at least one dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273, which is the final 
selected dose for the paediatric population 6-<12 years of age. Follow-up time is rather short. A safety 
follow-up of at least 28 days after dose 2 was performed for 853 participants who had received at least 
one dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. Safety follow-up for 3 months post-dose 2 was provided for 749 subjects 
who had received at least one dose of either 50 µg or 100 µg mRNA-1273 (in Part 1). 
The time-window foreseen for collection of unsolicited AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, and AESIs is up to 28 days after 
each injection, this means that a meaningful short term follow-up is only available for a minority of 
subjects, i.e. 18.8% in the main Part 2. The MAH stated that follow-up safety data for a later time point 
(e.g. 22nd November 2021) was, that not possible within this procedure. The MAH proposed to conduct 
another interim analysis (IA) based on a 10th November 2021 data cut-off, meeting per protocol IA 
specification (all participants 6 to <12 years in Part 2 reach Day 57 or had discontinued the study). The 
2nd IA was submitted as requested. Almost all subjects in both phases have follow-up of 28 days post-
dose 2. However, still not all subjects had a follow-up of 56 days or longer post-dose 2, neither in the 
blinded phase (below 40% of subjects) nor taking blinded and unblinded phase together (less than 50%). 
Day 56 follow-up post-dose 2 is available for 1,066 subjects in the blinded phase and for 1,498 subjects 
in the blinded/unblinded phase. Unblinding and cross-over vaccinations for the 6 to <12-year-old age 
group in Part 2 started on 1st November 2021, 9 days before the data cut-off date for the pre-specified 
IA, marking the ending of the blinded follow-up for this age group. This was necessary because of a 
COVID-19 vaccine became available via EUA. This is acknowledged.

Disposition 
Part 1 
In Part 1, at the time of the data snapshot (06 October 2021), 380 participants (100%) in the 50 μg 
group and 371 participants (100%) in the 100 μg group had received dose 1; 379 participants (99.7%) in 
the 50 μg group and 371 participants (100%) in the 100 μg group had received dose 2. One subject (in 
the 50 µg dose group) discontinued study vaccination due to an adverse event of urticaria papular on Day 
9 following dose 1. Details are described in the AE section below. One subject in the 100 µg dose group 
withdraw from the study because of lost to follow-up. 3 subjects (0.4%), 1 in the 50 µg dose group and 2 
in the 100 µg dose group withdraw consent.

Part 2 
In Part 2, at the time of the data snapshot (06 October 2021), 3007 participants in the mRNA-1273 group 
and 995 participants in the placebo group had received dose 1 and 2987 participants in the mRNA-1273 
group and 969 participants in the placebo group had received dose 2. A total of 12 (0.3%) participants 
discontinued study vaccine, 6 participants each in the mRNA-1273 group (0.2%) and the placebo group 
(0.6%). Reasons for discontinuation of study vaccine in the mRNA-1273 group for 2 participants each 
(<0.1%) were physician decision, withdrawal of consent and other. Although none of the participants 
were coded as discontinuing due to an AE, 1 of the 2 participants who discontinued study vaccination due 
to physician decision had an AE of rash, on Day 10. In addition to the 12 participants coded as 
discontinuing study vaccine, an additional participant had AEs of urticaria on Day 24 and wheezing on 
Day 29 that were coded in the AE section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) as leading to 
discontinuation of study vaccine.

Overall, 20 subjects (0.5%) withdraw from the study, 9 participants (0.3%) in the mRNA-1273 group and 
11 (1.1%) in the placebo group. Reasons for study withdrawal in the mRNA-1273 group were withdrawal 
of consent for 6 participants (0.2%). One subject each withdraw due to an event of moderate AE 
(inflammatory bowel disease), due to physician decision, and because of other not specified reasons. The 
AE of inflammatory bowel disease was not considered being vaccine related by the investigator and is 
described in the section “Discontinuation due to adverse events” in this AR. The new possible diagnosis 
for this event after follow-up investigation is Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). No further 
information is provided for the subjects who discontinued due to physician decision. A summary of the 
participant disposition is provided in Table 24.

Study disposition in the 2nd IA 
In Part 1, at the time of the IA, 380 participants in the 50 μg group and 371 participants in the 100 μg 
group received dose 1 and 379 participants in the 50 μg group and 371 participants in the 100 μg group

received dose 2. As of 10th November 2021, no additional participants have been withdrawn due to TEAE 
in Part 1. 
In Part 2, a total of 4,002 participants had received dose 1 (3007 in mRNA-1273 group and 995 in 
placebo group) and a total of 3,961 participants had received dose 2 (2,988 in the mRNA-1273 group and 
973 in placebo group. The proportion of subjects who discontinued through 10th November 2021 was 
comparable to the first interim analyses. A total of 13 subjects (0.4%) in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
discontinued from vaccination. One subject discontinued due to an AE, and 2 due to physician decision 
(no change compared with the 1st interim analysis). 6 subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
withdrew consent (i.e. 0.2% compared with 0.1% in the 1st interim analysis), 3 subjects entered cross-
over phase and 1 subject discontinued due to other not further specified reason. 
In summary, in the 10th November 2021 IA safety analysis, a median follow-up of 56 days post-dose 2 is 
provided for a total of 3,387 participants exposed to 50 µg mRNA-1273 across study Parts 1 and 2 from 
the blinded and open label phases. From Part 2, median follow-up of 55 days post-dose 2 is provided for 
4,002 participants (3,007 exposed to 50 µg of mRNA-1273 and 995 to placebo). 
Demography 
Part 1 
The proportion of female and male participants was overall balanced in in Part 1 of the trial. In total, 
51.1% of subjects were female and 48.9% male. In the 100 µg dose group slightly more females 
(53.6%) than males (46.4%) were included, vice versa in the 50 µg dose group (48.7% females and 
51.3% males). The two dose groups were also balanced with regards to age, weight, and SARS-CoV-2 
baseline serostatus. Mean age is 8.6 years in both dose groups, the mean weight 34.93 and 34.86 kg. 
86.1% of participants in the 50 µg and 86.8% in the 100 µg dose group were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative 
at baseline, 7.4% versus 8.1% were seropositive, and from 6.6% and 5.1% of participants in the 50 µg 
and the 100 µg dose group, the SARS-CoV-2 baseline status is not known.

Part 2 
Demography and baseline characteristics in Part 2 are not notably different from Part 1. Demographics 
and baseline characteristics were balanced between the mRNA-1273 group and the placebo group. In 
total, 49.2% of subjects were female and 50.8% male. In the mRNA-1273 group slightly more males 
(51.7%) than females (48.3%) were included, vice versa in the placebo group (48.3% males and 51.7%

females). Like in Part 1, the two study groups were also balanced with regards to age, weight, and SARS-
CoV-2 baseline serostatus. Mean age is 8.5 years in the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group, the mean 
weight is 33.33 and 33.52 kg. 89.5% of participants in the mRNA-1273 and 88.2% in the placebo group 
were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative, 8.5% versus 8.7% seropositive, from 1.9% and 3.0% of participants in 
the two groups the SARS-CoV-2 baseline status is not known.

The CHMP considered that the demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two 
dose groups in Part 1 and between the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group in Part 2. Part 1 and Part 2 
were also comparable with regards to Demographics and baseline characteristics. The majority of 
participants in both parts of the study were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline (86.4% in Part 1 and 
89.2% in Part 2).  
Safety analysis set 
All safety analyses in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study are based on the Safety Set, except summaries of 
solicited ARs, which are based on the Solicited Safety Set. The safety set consists of all enrolled 
participants (in Part 1) and all randomly assigned participants (in Part 2) who receive at least 1 dose of 
IP. The Solicited Safety Set consists of participants in the Safety Set who contributed any solicited AR 
data. Beside the Solicited Safety Set there are two more Solicited Safety Sets. The first Injection Solicited 
Safety Set comprises of all participants in the Solicited Safety Set who have received the first study 
injection and have contributed any solicited AR data from the time of first study injection through the 
following 6 days. The Second Injection Solicited Safety Set includes all participants in the Solicited Safety 
Set who have received the second study injection and have contributed any solicited AR data from the 
time of second study injection through the following 6 days.

Adverse events 
The P204 paediatric study evaluates the collection of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) 
for 7 days following each and any dose. All unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were to be collected for 28 
days following each injection and serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs (MAAEs), AEs of 
special interest (AESIs), and AEs leading to withdrawals are collected for the study duration. At each 
injection visit, participants’ parent(s) were to be instructed on thermometer (oral/tympanic) usage to 
measure body temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration 
(hardness), and assessment for localised axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection 
arm/thigh. AEs were to be recorded by the participants’ parent(s) via eDiary. The eDiary was adapted for 
use in paediatric populations from the eDiary used in the Study P301 submission for adults ≥ 18 years of 
age. Severity assessment of solicited ARs was to be performed according to Guidance for industry - 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine 
Clinical Trials (DHHS 2007) modified for use in children 37 months to < 12 years of age. The 
determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs was to be performed upon medical judgment based on 
pre-defined severity definitions in the CTP. Per protocol, all solicited ARs (local and systemic) were to be 
considered vaccine related. For unsolicited AEs causality assessment was to be performed by the 
investigator according to classification pre-defined in the CTP.  
Solicited adverse reactions 
Solicited local ARs assessed included pain, erythema, swelling, and axillary swelling or tenderness. 
Solicited systemic ARs assessed included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, and 
nausea/vomiting. Toxicity grades for injection site erythema (redness) or swelling (hardness) are defined 
as: grade 1: 25-50 mm, grade 2; 51-100 mm, grade 3: >100 mm, and grade 4: necrosis or exfoliative 
dermatitis. Toxicity grades for injection site pain and for axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness is 
defined as: grade 1: no interference with activity, grade 2: some interference with activity, grade 3: 
prevents daily activity, and grade 4: emergency room visit or hospitalisation. Toxicity grades for fever are 
defined as: grade 1: 38.0-38.4°C, grade 2: 38.5-38.9°C, grade 3: 39.0-40.0°C, and grade 4: >40.0°C. 
Toxicity grades for other solicited systemic ARs are defined as: grade 1: no interference with activity (or, 
for nausea/vomiting: 1-2 episodes/24 hours), grade 2: some interference with activity (or, for 
nausea/vomiting: >2 episodes/24 hours), grade 3: prevents daily activity, and grade 4: emergency room 
visit or hospitalisation. Any solicited AR that meets either of the following criteria was also included in the 
analysis of unsolicited AEs: 1) solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days post-injection 2) 
solicited local or systemic AR meeting SAE criteria. These events appear in both solicited AR and 
unsolicited AE tables. 
Very minor changes in the incidence of solicited ARs were noted for part 1 and part 2 in the 2nd analysis 
with cut-off date 10th November 2021. Upon request, the MAH confirmed, that the root cause for these 
changes is that additional subjects having completed ≥ 7 days since second injection, which is the period 
for collection of SARs via eDiary in Part 2: 
•  6th October 2021 Data snapshot: n (%): 2958 (98.4) mRNA-1273; and 962 (96.7) Placebo 
(Source: Study P204 Table 14.1.5.2) 
•  10th November 2021 Interim Analysis: n (%): 2990 (99.4) mRNA-1273; and 971 (97.6) Placebo 
(Source: Study P204 Table 14.1.5.2) 
Moreover, with the on-going nature of the study additional queries were closed, and further activities 
regarding data cleaning were conducted, which may contribute. The minor changes in the incidence of 
solicited ARs do not impact the benefit-risk balance of Spikevax.

The CHMP considered that the procedures implemented in the CTP are adequate for the collection and 
evaluation of the safety and reactogenicity profile of the vaccine the in the target population (i.e. the 
paediatric population from 6 to below 12 years of age. 
Solicited local ARs 
Part 1 
The study began with dosing participants in the 6 years to < 12-year age group in Part 1 with 50 μg of 
mRNA-1273. After at least 75 participants had completed Day 8 (1 week after dose 1 of mRNA-1273 50 
μg), an internal safety team reviewed the available safety data and agreed with the pre-specified protocol 
plans to proceed with the 100 μg arm in Part 1 in the 6 years to < 12-year age group. 
In summary, the review of the reactogenicity profile of the 50 μg dose was comparable to what had been 
observed in young adults 18 to 25 years of age who had received 100 μg in Study P301. The 100 μg dose 
was more reactogenic in 6 years to < 12-year-old participants than in the older populations as evidenced 
by an increased fever rate. 
Solicited local ARs occurred in a lower incidence in the 50 µg dose group compared with the 100 µg dose 
group after each dose. The incidence of solicited local ARs in both dose groups was, as previously 
observed in other mRNA-1273 clinical trials higher post-dose 2 compared with post-dose 1. The difference 
in reactogenicity post-each dose was less pronounced for pain in both dose groups than for the other 
solicited local ARs. The incidence of local solicited ARs after each dose is presented in Table27. The 
incidence of any solicited local AR after any dose was slightly lower in the 50 µg dose group (97.4% of 
subjects) compared with the 100 µg dose group (98.1%). The most often reported solicited local AR in 
both dose groups after any dose was pain reported by 96.8% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 97.6% in 
the 100 µg dose group. This was followed by erythema (26.1% versus 37.2%), swelling (25.0% versus 
32.6%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (18.9% versus 25.9%). The majority of solicited 
local ARs was reported as mild to moderate in both groups. Again, the incidence of severe ARs was higher 
in the 100 µg group compared with the 50 µg group. The most frequently reported grade 3 local solicited 
AR after any dose in both groups was pain, reported by 2.6% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 6.2% in the 
100 µg dose group. Grade 3 erythema was reported by 1.1% versus 4.3% of subjects, and grade 3 
swelling by 0.8% versus 1.9%. No grade 3 axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness was reported in the 
50 µg group, but by 2 subjects in the 100 µg group. No grade 4 solicited local ARs reported in the 50 µg 
and the 100 µg dose group. The incidence of solicited local ARs after any injection is provided in Table 28. 
Solicited local ARs in participants in both dose groups had after any dose a median onset of 1 day and 
generally persisted for a median of 3 days after any injection in both groups. Any solicited local AR 
persisting beyond 7 days after any injection was reported by 5.3% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 4.3% 
in the 100 µg dose group. The most frequently reported solicited local AR persisting beyond 7 days after 
any injection was erythema (2.6% of subjects), followed by axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness 
(2.4% of subjects, respectively). In the 50 μg group, the most common solicited local ARs persisting 
beyond 7 days after dose 1 include erythema (2.4%) and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness 
(2.1%). Solicited local ARs persisting beyond 7 days after dose 2 included injection site pain (1.1% of 
participants), erythema (0.3%), injection site swelling (0.5%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or 
tenderness (0.5%). Late onset solicited local ARs starting after day 7 post-dose 1 were reported by 3.9% 
of participants in the 50 µg dose group and by 2.7% in the 100 µg dose group. The ARs reported in the 
50 µg dose were injection site erythema in 3.9% and injection site swelling in 0.5% of participants. The 
ARs reported after dose 1 in the 100 µg dose were injection site erythema in 2.7% and injection site 
swelling in 0.8% of participants, respectively. No late onset local solicited ARs were reported after dose 2.

Solicited systemic ARs 
Part 1 
Solicited systemic ARs occurred with a lower incidence in the 50 µg dose group compared to the 100 µg 
dose group after each dose. The incidence of systemic ARs in both dose groups was higher post-dose 2 
compared with post-dose 1. The difference in reactogenicity post- each dose was more pronounced for 
systemic ARs compared with local ARs. This is in line to what has been observed in previous Spikevax 
clinical trials. The incidence of systemic solicited ARs after each dose is presented in Table 30. The 
incidence of any solicited systemic AR after any dose was slightly lower in the 50 µg dose group (82.6% 
of subjects) compared with the 100 µg dose group (89.5%). The most often reported solicited systemic 
AR in the 50 µg dose group after any dose was fatigue reported by 68.9% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 
74.7% in the 100 µg dose group. This was followed by headache (60.0% versus 68.5%), myalgia (28.7%

versus 38.8%), nausea (26.3% versus 32.6%), chills (25.8% versus 39.9%), fever (23.4% versus 
31.8%), and arthralgia (16.1% versus 24.5%). The majority of solicited systemic ARs was reported as 
mild to moderate in both groups. Again, the incidence of severe ARs was higher in the 100 µg group 
compared with the 50 µg group. The most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited AR after any 
dose in the 50 µg dose group was fatigue, reported by 7.9% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 12.4% in the 
100 µg dose group. Grade 3 headache was reported by 3.7% versus 6.7% of subjects, and grade 3 fever 
by 2.9% versus 5.7% of subjects. Grade 3 myalgia was reported by 1.8% versus 5.1% of subjects. Other 
grade 3 solicited systemic ARs were reported by not more than 0.5% of subjects in the 50 µg dose group. 
No grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported in the 50 µg dose group, but by 2 subjects in the 100 µg 
group (both reported grade 4 fever). The incidence of solicited systemic ARs after any dose is provided in 
Table 31. Solicited systemic ARs in participants in both dose groups had after any dose a median onset of 
1 day and generally persisted for a median of 2 days after any injection in both groups. The incidence of 
any solicited systemic AR persisting beyond 7 days after any injection was 3.2% each in the 50 µg and 
the 100 µg dose group. The most often reported systemic solicited ARs persisting beyond day 7 in the 50 
µg group were fatigue (reported by 1.8% of subjects), headache (1.3%), and nausea (1.1%). For all 
other solicited systemic ARs only 0.3% of subjects reported persisting events. Late onset solicited 
systemic ARs starting after day 7 post-dose 1 were not reported in the 50 µg dose group after dose 1. 
Only 1 subject reported persisting fever after dose 2.

Part 2 
Solicited local ARs 
Solicited local ARs occurred in a higher incidence in the mRNA-1273 group compared with the placebo 
group, as it can be expected. The incidence of solicited local ARs in the mRNA-1273 group was, as 
previously observed in Part 1 and in other mRNA-1273 clinical trials higher post-dose 2 compared with 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 61/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
post-dose 1. The incidence of local solicited ARs after each dose is presented in Table 31. The incidence of 
any solicited local AR after any dose was reported by 98.6% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 group and by 
65.2% in the placebo group. The most often reported solicited local AR in the mRNA-1273 group after any 
dose was pain reported by 98.4% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 versus 64.1% in the placebo group. This 
was followed by axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (26.9% versus 12.6%), erythema (24.3.0% 
versus 2.0%), and injection site swelling (22.5% versus 2.0%). The majority of solicited local ARs was 
reported as mild to moderate in both groups. Again, the incidence of severe ARs was higher in the mRNA-
1273 compared with the placebo group. The most frequently reported grade 3 local solicited AR after any 
dose in the mRNA-1273 group was pain, reported by 3.3% of subjects. Grade 3 erythema was reported 
by 1.6%, and grade 3 injection site swelling by 1.3% of subjects. Grade 3 axillary (or groin) swelling or 
tenderness was reported for only 0.2% of subjects. No grade 4 solicited local ARs was reported in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group. The incidence of solicited local ARs after any is provided in Table 32. The 
majority of the solicited local ARs in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 occurred within Day 1 (94.8%) to 
day 2 (3.6%) after any dose and persisted for a median of 3 days. Any solicited local AR persisting 
beyond 7 days after any injection was reported by 4.6% of subjects in the vaccine and by 2.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported solicited local AR persisting beyond 7 days 
after any injection in the mRNA-1273 group was axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness reported by 
2.2% of subjects, followed by injection site pain and injection site erythema reported by 1.4% of subjects 
each in the vaccine group. Persisting injection site swelling was reported by 0.9% of subjects in the 
vaccine group. Late onset solicited local ARs starting after day 7 in the mRNA-1273 group were reported 
by 2.7% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group post-dose 1, but only by < 0.1% of participants (3) 
post-dose 2. The ARs reported after any dose were injection site swelling (0.7%) participants), injection 
site pain (0.5%), erythema (2.1%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (< 0.1%) of 
participants.

Solicited systemic ARs 
Solicited systemic ARs also occurred in a higher incidence in the mRNA-1273 group compared with the 
placebo group. The incidence of solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-1273 group was again notably higher 
post-dose 2 compared with post-dose 1. The difference in reactogenicity post- each dose was again more 
distinct for systemic than for local ARs. The incidence of systemic solicited ARs after each dose is 
presented in Table 34. The incidence of any solicited systemic AR after any dose was reported by 86.5% 
of subjects in the mRNA-1273 group and by 67.2% in the placebo group. The most often reported 
solicited systemic AR in the mRNA-1273 group after any dose was fatigue reported by 73.0% of subjects 
in the mRNA-1273 versus 47.2% in the placebo group. This was followed by headache (62.0% versus 
43.7%), myalgia (35.2% versus 17.3%), chills (34.6% versus 11.8), nausea (29.2% versus 17.8%), 
fever (25.9% versus 3.6%), and arthralgia (21.2% versus 13.4%). The majority of solicited systemic ARs 
was reported as mild to moderate in both groups. Again, the incidence of severe ARs was higher in the 
mRNA-1273 compared with the placebo group. The most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited 
AR after any dose in the mRNA-1273 group was fatigue, reported by 7.1% of subjects. Grade 3 headache 
was reported by 4.4%, and grade 3 fever by 4.2%. Grade 3 myalgia was reported by 2.7% of subjects. 
All other solicited systemic ARs were reported by not more than 0.9% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 
group after any dose. No grade 4 solicited systemic AR was reported in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group. 
The incidence of solicited local ARs after any dose is provided in Table 35. The majority of the solicited 
systemic ARs in participants in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 after any dose occurred within day 1 
(57.1%) to day 2 (25.9%) and persisted for a median of 2 days. Any solicited systemic AR persisting 
beyond 7 days after any injection was reported by 4.0% of subjects in the vaccine and by 4.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AR persisting beyond 7 
days after any injection in the mRNA-1273 group was headache reported by 2.2% of subjects, followed 
by fatigue reported by 1.8% of subjects in the vaccine group. All other persisting solicited systemic ARs 
were reported by not more than 0.5% of subjects after any dose in the vaccine group. Late onset solicited 
systemic ARs starting after day 7 in the mRNA-1273 group were reported by only 0.5% of subjects in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group after any dose (by 0.4% of subjects after dose 1 and by 0.1% after dose 2).

Update on solicited local and systemic ARs (Cut-off date 10th November 2021) 
Very minor changes in the incidence of solicited local and systemic ARs in part 1 and part 2 were noted. 
As described above, the minor changes are due to data clearance and additional subjects with follow-up 
on solicited ARs post-dose 2. The changes do not alter the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax.

Use of pain medication 
In Part 1, the use of pain and/or fever medication for prevention and for treatment was notably higher in 
the 100 µg dose group compared with the 50 µg dose group. For both groups the use was notably higher 
post -dose 2 compared with post-dose 1, which is in line with the higher local and systemic reactogenicity 
post-dose 2. Post-dose 1 for a total of 24.9% of participants in the 50 µg dose group the use of 
pain/fever medication, either for prevention or for treatment was reported. In the vast majority of 
subjects, the medication use was for treatment (24.1%); only 1.3% of subjects in the 50 µg dose group 
received prophylactic pain/fever medication. In the 100 µg dose group 43.6% of participants reported the 
use of pain/fever medication, 6.5% for prevention and 42.3% for treatment. 
In part 2, as it can be expected the use of pain/fever medication for treatment was notably higher in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the placebo group (approximately 2.7 fold higher post-dose 1 
and approximately 5.7 fold higher post-dose 2). The proportion of participants with prophylactic use was 
comparable in the two groups post-dose 1 (2.1% in the placebo, and 2.7% in the vaccine group), but 
approximately 2 fold higher in the vaccine group (5.3%) compared with the placebo group (2.4%) post-
dose 2. This appears to be plausible because of the blinded design and the higher reactogenicity in the 
vaccine group post-dose 1. The use of pain/fever medication for treatment in the placebo group was 
comparable post-dose 1 (8.7%) and post-dose 2 (8.1%), whereas it was in the vaccine group notably 
higher post-dose 2 (46.2%) compared with post-dose 1 (23.1%). 
The proportion of subjects using pain medication to prevent or to treat pain and fever in the placebo and 
the mRNA-1273 vaccine group was not meaningful different in the 2nd update analysis. Only minimal 
changes, possibly due to rounding are noticed. 
The proportion of subjects using medication to prevent fever or pain in the placebo group post-dose 1 
was 2.1% (21) and 2.4% (23) post-dose 2. The respective proportions in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
were 2.7% (80) and 5.4% (160) post-dose 1 and post-dose 2. 
The proportion of subjects using medication to treat fever or pain in the placebo group post-dose 1 was 
8.7% (86) and 8.3% (80) post-dose 2. The respective proportions in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group were 
23.1% (694) and 46.4% (1385) post-dose 1 and post-dose 2. No updated data were submitted for Part 
1. The proportions should not differ meaningfully in the 2nd interim analysis. 
Comparison of reactogenicity between Participants 6 to < 12 Years of Age in the 50 µg mRNA-
1273 group of Study P204 (N=3387) and 18- to 25-year-old participants in the mRNA-1273 
group (100 μg) in Part A of Study P301 (N=878) 
Solicited ARs from 6- to < 12-year-old participants in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 group of Study P204 were 
compared with solicited ARs reported from 18- to 25-year-old participants in the mRNA-1273 group (100 
μg) in Part A of Study P301, a population for which efficacy has been demonstrated. Tables comparing 
rates of local and systemic solicited and unsolicited AEs after were provided. The included results show 
AEs that occurred after any dose in children 6 to <12 years of age receiving 50 μg mRNA-1273 in study 
P204 (Part 1 and Part 2 combined, based on 6th October 2021 data snapshot) versus young adults 18 to 
25 years of age receiving 100 μg of mRNA-1273 (study P301, based on 04 May 2021 database lock). 
The proportion of subjects who reported solicited local ARs within 7 days after any dose of mRNA-1273 
tended to be higher for the 50 µg dose group of participants 6 to <12 years of age in trial P204 (98.4%) 
compared to the 100 µg dose group participants 18-25 years of age in Study P301 (94.1%). The most 
frequently reported solicited local AR was injection site pain in both groups, reported by 98.2% of 
subjects in P204 and by 93.5% in P301. This was followed by injection site erythema (24.5% versus 
9.5%), and injection site swelling (22.8% of subjects in the younger age cohort, versus 14.0% in the 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 69/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
older age cohort. The proportion of subjects who reported axillary or groin swelling or tenderness was 
comparable in both age cohorts (26.0% versus 27.9%). In participants in both studies the majority of 
solicited local ARs were grade 1 or 2. The incidence of grade 3 solicited local ARs was lower in P204 
participants (5.5%) compared with P301 participants (11.4%). Overall, the incidence of any systemic 
solicited AR after any dose was comparable between subjects in P204 (86.1%) and P301 (89.1%). 
However, the incidence of each pre-defined solicited systemic AR except of fever was lower in subjects 6-
<12 years of age compared to subjects 18-25 years of age. The most frequently reported solicited 
systemic ARs after any dose in both groups were fatigue (reported by 72.6% of subjects 6 to <12 years 
of age in P204 and by 73.0% of subjects 18-25 years and headache (61.8% versus 73.8%, respectively). 
This was followed by myalgia (34.5% versus 63.2%), and chills (33.6% versus 53.6%). Fever was 
reported by 25.6% versus 18.1% of subjects in the younger and the older age cohort, respectively. The 
majority of solicited systemic ARs after any dose were graded as mild or moderate in both groups. 
Solicited systemic grade 3 ARs were overall less frequently reported by participants 6-12 years of age in 
Study P204 (13.1%) compared with Study P301 participants 18-25 years of age (23.5%). The results of 
solicited ARs are summarised in Table 36 and Table 37 below.

Unsolicited AEs in the two age cohorts 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs experienced within 28 days after any dose was comparable in children 
and young adults. Any unsolicited AE during 28 days after vaccination was reported by 24.6% versus 
25.9% of participants in the 2 age cohorts, respectively. 10 severe AEs were reported in 9 participants 6-
<12 years of age (0.3%). 6 unsolicited grade 3 AEs were considered being vaccine related by the 
investigators. This included 2 severe AEs of injection site pain, 1 case each of vomiting, urticaria, and 2 
cases of fatigue. The grading of the unsolicited AE of oropharyngeal pain mentioned in the clinical 
overview text is a bit unclear from the documents. Oropharyngeal pain was reported as grade 3 in the 
clinical overview, but was not included in table 14.3.1.17.2.1 that listed severe unsolicited AEs. In the 
p204-part2-listings, all but one AE of oropharyngeal pain were graded as mild or moderate and for one 
AE of oropharyngeal pain no grading and no causality assessment was provided in the listings. A 
summarising overview comparing and unsolicited AEs in the two age cohorts of children 6 to<12 years of 
age and young adults 18 to 25 years of age is given in Table 38.

Additional comparison of reactogenicity to participants aged ≥ 12 to < 18 Years (n=2,485, 
Study P301): 
The AR of fever (25.9% vs. 13.7%, grade 3: 4.2% vs. 2.2%) was the only event which was clearly more 
common (after any injection) in younger children (6 to <12 years), compared to adolescents (≥12 to <18 
years). In contrast, lower incidences were reported for the ARs of headache (62% vs. 78.4%), myalgia 
(35.2% vs. 54.3%), arthralgia (21.1% vs. 34.6%), chills (34.6% vs. 49.1%), swelling (22.5% vs. 
27.7%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (26.9 % vs. 34.6%). The reporting rates were 
comparable for the following events: fatigue (73% vs. 75.2%), nausea/vomiting (29.2% vs. 29.3%), pain 
(98.4% vs. 97.2%), erythema (24.3% vs. 25.8%). The data for adolescents were extracted from the 
EPAR. 
Solicited ARs from 6 to < 12-year-old participants in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 group of Study P204 were 
compared with solicited ARs reported from 18- to 25-year-old participants in the mRNA-1273 group (100 
μg) in Part A of Study P301, a population for whom efficacy has been demonstrated. Tables comparing 
rates of local and systemic solicited and unsolicited AEs were provided. The results show AEs that 
occurred after any dose in children 6 to <12 years of age receiving 50 μg mRNA-1273 in study P204 (Part 
1 and Part 2 combined, based on 6th October 2021 data snapshot) versus young adults 18 to 25 years of 
age receiving 100 μg of mRNA-1273 (study P301, based on 04 May 2021 database lock). Local 
reactogenicity appeared to be higher in the younger age cohort 6 to <12 years of age compared with the 
older age cohort 18-25 years of age. The majority of local ARs however was mild to moderate in both age 
cohorts and was lower in the younger ones. Grade 3 solicited local ARs were reported by 5.5% of subjects 
6-<12 years of age and by 11.4% of subjects 18-25 years of age. In contrast to local reactogenicity, the 
systemic reactogenicity tended to be lower in the younger age cohort. The incidence of any systemic 
solicited AR after any dose was comparable between subjects in P204 (86.1%) and P301 (89.1%). 
However, the incidence of each pre-defined solicited systemic AR except of fever was lower in subjects 6-
<12 years of age compared to subjects 18-25 years of age. Also solicited grade 3 systemic ARs were 
overall less frequently reported by participants 6-<12 years of age in Study P204 (13.1%) compared with 
Study P301 participants 18-25 years of age (23.5%). The incidence of unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after 
vaccination, including medically attended AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation from the second dose or the 
trial, and serious AEs were comparable. In summary, the CHMP considered that no meaningful difference 
EMA/137337/2022

could be detected with regard to the reactogenicity in the younger paediatric population 6 to <12 years of 
age and young adults 18 to 25 years of age. 
Unsolicited adverse events irrespective of causality Part 1 and Part 2 
In both parts of the trial, unsolicited AEs after any dose were collected during the 28 days after each 
injection. 
Part 1 
In both parts of the trial, unsolicited AEs after any dose were collected during the 28 days after each 
injection. 
Part 1 
As of 6th October 2021, the incidence of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality was slightly higher in the 
50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the 100 µg dose group. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of 
causality up to 28 days after any dose were reported by 30.5% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 25.9% in 
the 100 µg dose group. Then incidence of medically attended adverse events (MAAEs) was comparable in 
the 2 dose groups (11.8% versus 12.7% of subjects in the 50 µg and the 100 µg group, respectively). 
One participant (in the 50 μg group) was discontinued from the study vaccine due to a TEAE of urticaria 
papular. The event is described and discussed in the applicable section “Discontinuation due to adverse 
events” of this AR. Serious adverse events in the time window of 28 days after each vaccination were 
only reported in the 50 µg dose group (by 2 subjects). These SAEs were not considered being vaccine 
related and included an event of palpitations and an event of foreign body ingestion. The two SAEs are 
described in the corresponding section “Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events” below. 
The most common reported unsolicited AEs, i.e. those reported by more than 1% of subjects in the 50 µg 
group were injection site erythema (4.5%), upper respiratory infection (3.2%), oropharyngeal pain 
(3.4%), nasal congestion (2.9%), cough (2.1%), headache (1.6%), nasopharyngitis (1.3%), urinary tract 
infection (1.3%), rhinorrhoea (1.3%), otitis externa (1.3%), injection site lymphadenopathy (1.3%), 
fatigue (1.3%), and vomiting (1.1%). No severe unsolicited AEs were reported in the 50 µg dose group 
and only one severe unsolicited AE (injection site erythema with an onset 8 days post-dose 1) in the 100 
µg dose group in part 1 of the trial. 
Update 2nd IA 10th November 2021: 
Nature and proportion of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality, recorded within the first interim 
analyses is not different compared to the 2nd analyses with the cut-off date 10th November 2021. The 
most common reported unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after any dose were the same as in the 1st analysis, 
with only minimal changes in the incidence for some of the events (Table 14.3.1.8.1.1. topline-p1). This 
minimal change does not alter the benefit-risk ratio or the safety profile of Spikevax when given to 
children 5 to below 12 years of age. The incidence of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality was like in 
the first analysis slightly higher in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the 100 µg dose 
group. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality up to 28 days after any dose were reported by 31.3% of 
subjects in the 50 µg and by 27.0% in the 100 µg dose group. The incidence of medically attended 
adverse events (MAAEs) was almost identical as compared to the 1st interim analysis, and comparable in 
the 2 dose groups (11.6% versus 12.7% of subjects in the 50 µg and the 100 µg group, respectively. It 
should be noted, that since the last data cut (06-Oct-2021), there were no new SAEs reported in the 50 
μg group. The previously reported SAE of palpitations in a 7-year old girl in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 
vaccine group was subsequently downgraded to non-serious. This event was considered as not being 
vaccine related. Details are described in the SAE section below. 
Part 2 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 75/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
As of 6th October 2021, the incidence of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality was slightly higher in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the placebo group. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality 
were reported by 23.8% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 group and by 19.5% in the placebo group up to 
28 days post-vaccination. The majority of AEs was due to the SOC of general disorders and 
administration site conditions. The most frequently unsolicited AEs in the mRNA-1273 group included the 
PTs injection site erythema (2.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.3%), headache (2.3%), 
oropharyngeal pain (2.0%), cough (1.8%), rhinorrhoea (1.7%), nasal congestion (1.6%), injection site 
lymphadenopathy (1.4%), injection site pain (1.2%), and fatigue (1.1%). In the placebo group, the most 
frequently reported unsolicited AEs were oropharyngeal pain (2.2%), nasal congestion (2.2%), COVID-19 
(2.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.9%), headache (1.8%), rhinorrhoea (1.8%), cough (2.1%), 
and fatigue (1.2%). The comparison shows that unsolicited AEs experienced in the mRNA-1273 group do 
not notably differ in nature and incidence to those in the placebo group with the exception of an increase 
in the incidence of injection site conditions in the mRNA-1273 group. Medically-attended AEs were 
reported in 8.5% of participants in the mRNA-1273 group and by 10.1% in the placebo group. 2 subjects 
(<0.1%) were discontinued from vaccination in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group because of an AE. The 
events leading to discontinuation from vaccination were rash in one subject and urticaria and wheezing in 
the other subject. The events are discussed in this AR in the respective section (“Discontinuation due to 
adverse events”) below. No participants in the mRNA-1273 group were discontinued from the study as a 
result of an unsolicited AE. 2 serious unsolicited AEs within 28 days of any dose were reported for 2 (< 
0.1%) subjects in the mRNA-1273 group (appendicitis and cellulitis orbital. The two SAEs were not 
considered being vaccine related and are discussed in the serious adverse event section of this AR. 
According to table 14.3.1.17.2.1 a total of 10 severe TEAEs were reported in 9 (0.3%) participants in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group in part 2 of the trial. The unsolicited severe AEs included fatigue (2 events in 2 
subjects), injection site pain (2 AEs in 2 subjects), cellulitis orbital, nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea (in 1 
subject), oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, urticaria, and foot fracture. According to the P204-part2-listings 
overall 6 severe unsolicited AEs were considered being vaccine related. This includes 2 severe AEs of 
injection site pain, 2 cases of fatigue, and one case each of vomiting and urticaria were considered being 
vaccine related by the investigator. 
Update 2nd IA 10th November 2021: 
Like for Part 1, a minimal change in the incidence of AEs is noted for unsolicited AEs irrespective of 
causality in the 2nd interim analysis for Part 2. The difference does not alter the safety profile or the risk/ 
benefit of mRNA-1273 when given to the paediatric population 6-11 years of age. The incidence of 
unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after any dose irrespective of causality was in both groups higher than in 
analysis 1. The increase was comparable in both groups (approximately 6% in each group). The incidence 
of unsolicited AES irrespective of causality was like in analysis 1 slightly higher in the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group compared with the placebo group. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality were reported by 29.6 
% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 group and by 25.1% in the placebo group up to 28 days post-
vaccination. The most frequently unsolicited AEs in the mRNA-1273 group up to 28 days after any dose 
were the same as in the 1st analysis with slightly different incidences (Table 14.3.1.8.1.2 topline-part2), 
that do not alter the benefit-risk ratio or the safety profile of Spikevax in children 6-<12 years of age. In 
the 2nd analysis there was also an increase in the reported MAAEs in Part 2, both in the mRNA-1273 and 
in the placebo group. These increases were similar in percentage in both groups (approximately 5%), 
reflecting a longer follow-up in the study. Medically attended AEs irrespective of causality were again 
comparable in the vaccine (13.4%) and the placebo group (14.2%). 
The CHMP considered that the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax given to subjects 5 to below 12 years of 
age was not altered in the 2nd IA with regard to unsolicited AEs and medically attended AEs. 
EMA/137337/2022

Unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related 
Part 1 
As of 6th October 2021, the incidence of AEs considered being vaccine related in Part 1 was comparable 
between the 2 dose groups, i.e. 10.8% in the 50 µg and 11.3% in the 100 µg group. Medically attended 
AEs considered being vaccine related were reported in 1.1% of subjects in the 50 µg dose group and by 
1.9% of subjects in the 100 µg dose group. Upon request the MAH submitted Table 14.3.1.11.1 
summarising unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related for part 1. The most frequently reported 
unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related in both groups belonged to the SOC of General disorders 
and administration site conditions (8.4% of subjects versus 8.1% of subjects in the 50 µg and the 100 µg 
dose group). Leading symptom in this SOC in the 50 µg dose group was injection site erythema (4.5% 
versus 3.2%), followed by injection site lymphadenopathy (1.3% versus 1.1%), injection site rash (0.8% 
versus 1.9%), injection site induration (0.8%) versus 1.3%), and injection site pruritus (0.8% versus 
0%). 
Only minimal changes with regard to unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related are seen in the 2nd 
analysis. The incidence of AEs considered being vaccine related in Part 1 tended to be slightly higher in 
both groups compared to the first analysis and is still comparable in the 2 dose groups (11.6% in the 50 
µg dose group and 12.7% in the 100 µg dose group). Medically attended AEs considered being vaccine 
related were reported in 0.8% of subjects in the 50 µg dose group and by 1.9% of subjects in the 100 µg 
dose group. 
The CHMP noted that overall, the vast majority of reported unsolicited AEs considered as being vaccine 
related belong to injection site conditions and are already covered in the SmPC. After assessment of the 
available clinical information, no AE considered as being vaccine related in Part 1 was identified for 
inclusion into section 4.8. 
Part 2 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related was higher in the vaccine group 
compared with the placebo group. As of 6th October 2021, unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine 
related were reported for 9.8% of subjects in the vaccine group and for 3.7% in the placebo group. 
Medically attended unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related were reported for 1.0% and 0.3% of 
subjects respectively. The subsequently submitted table 14.3.1.11.2 summarised unsolicited AEs 
considered being vaccine related for part 2 (Cut-off date 6th October 2021). Like for part 1 again the most 
frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related occurred in the SOC of General 
disorders and administration site conditions. For this SOC the incidence was higher in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group compared with the placebo group (7.5% of subjects compared to 2.2%). The huge 
majority of AEs included in this SOC are injection site/vaccination site AEs already covered in the SmPC. 
The most frequently reported AE in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group within this SOC is injection site 
erythema (2.7% of subjects in the vaccine versus no subjects in the placebo group). This is followed by 
injection site lymphadenopathy reported by 1.4% of subjects versus 0.4%, respectively, and injection site 
pain, reported by a comparable proportion of subjects in the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group (1.2% 
versus 1.0% of subjects, respectively). Different forms of rash (11 subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group and 1 subject in the placebo group) and urticaria (7 subjects versus 1 subject [0.2% versus 
0.1%]), both indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction are also more frequently reported in the mRNA-
1273 vaccine group compared with the placebo group. The AE “rash” is included in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC, and the AE “urticaria” is considered being covered by the broader term “rash”. Moreover the AE of 
hypersensitivity is included in section 4.8. An imbalance for the treatment-related AE of "abdominal pain" 
was noted (5 subjects [0.2%] in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and no subject in the placebo group). 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 77/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Together with one AE of “abdominal pain upper” in the vaccine group, the proportion would be 6 versus 0 
subjects. Similarly, there was also a trend for a slight imbalance for all unsolicited AEs (regardless of 
relatedness, Table 14.3.1.8.1.2) of the PTs abdominal pain (0.6% versus 0.4%), abdominal pain upper 
(0.3% versus 0.1%), and abdominal pain lower (1 subject versus 0 subject). The MAH was asked to 
discuss these findings. It may be warranted to include the AE of abdominal pain in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Another imbalance is observed for the AE non-cardiac-chest pain. 4 subjects in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group (0.1%) and no subject in the placebo group reported non-cardiac chest pain considered 
being vaccine related. In addition, one subject in the mRNA-1273 and no subject in the placebo group 
reported chest pain. A careful evaluation of AEs indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis has been 
performed by the MAH. This evaluation included the assessment of the AE chest pain and did not reveal 
any signal towards myo- or pericarditis. Based on the available clinical information, for none of the events 
of chest pain/chest discomfort, any other cardiac symptom or dyspnoea a causality could be established. 
More details are discussed in the section “Assessment of myocarditis and pericarditis”. 
Only minimal changes are noted for IA 2 with regard to vaccine related AEs/MAAEs. The incidence of 
unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related was again higher in the vaccine group compared with the 
placebo group. Unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related were reported for 10.6% and 5.0% of 
subjects in the vaccine and the placebo group, respectively. Medically attended unsolicited AEs considered 
being vaccine related were reported for 1.1% and 0.4% of subjects respectively. 
The CHMP considered that in general, the nature of unsolicited AEs considered to be vaccine related that 
were provided by the MAH does not change the safety profile of the vaccine as it has been determined for 
the adult population and the paediatric population 12 to <18 years of age or negatively impacts the 
overall positive benefit-risk ratio. One imbalance was observed for the event of abdominal pain in part 2 
(5 subjects [0.2%] in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and no subject in the placebo group). Together with 
one AE of “abdominal pain upper” in the vaccine group, the proportion would be 6 versus 0 subjects. 
Similarly, there was also a trend for a slight imbalance for all unsolicited AEs (regardless of relatedness, 
Table 14.3.1.8.1.2) of the PTs abdominal pain (0.6% versus 0.4%), abdominal pain upper (0.3% versus 
0.1%), and abdominal pain lower (1 subject versus 0 subject). The MAH was asked to discuss these 
findings. The MAH again summarised all AEs of abdominal pain (related and unrelated): 
• 
Incidence of Unsolicited Treatment-Related TEAEs: 
o  Abdominal pain was reported for 0 placebo participant and for 5 (0.2%) participants of 
mRNA-1273 (N=3007) 
o  Abdominal pain upper was reported for 0 placebo participant and for 1 (<0.1%) participant 
of mRNA-1273 (N=3007).  
• 
Incidence of Unsolicited TEAEs: 
o  Abdominal pain was reported for 4 (0.4%) placebo participants (N= 995) and 17 (0.6%) 
participants of mRNA-1273 (N=3007) 
o  Abdominal pain upper was reported for 1 (0.1%) placebo participant and for 9 (0.3%) 
participants of mRNA-1273 (N=3007)  
o  Abdominal pain lower was reported for 0 placebo participant and for 1 (<0.1%) participant 
of mRNA-1273 (N=3007). 
The MAH concluded, that the majority of the events reported in the mRNA-1273 arm were considered not 
related by the investigators and resolved within hours or few days after start date. Based on the analysis 
of the data, and given that comparison is limited given the small numbers of participants presenting the 
reported events and the 3:1 randomisation of the study, the MAH considers that there are no clinically 
meaningful differences in the proportion of reports in the placebo group vs the mRNA-1273 group. 
Therefore, no conclusion of an imbalance can be drawn.  
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 78/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The MAH finally considered that analysis of the safety data does not support inclusion of abdominal pain 
in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP did not fully agree with this. In young children, abdominal pain is generally frequent and the 
abdominal region is an organ onto which discomfort from other causes is often projected. Probably, the 
cases of abdominal pain in the vaccine group reflects the relatively high reactogenicity of the vaccine. It is 
acknowledged, that the majority of abdominal pain events was considered being not related by the 
investigator. However, the numerical imbalance, albeit small, remains. The 3:1 ratio is taken into account 
when considering the proportion of subjects reporting abdominal pain 0.2% versus 0%). Therefore, the 
event of abdominal pain should be included into the SmPC with the corresponding frequency and a 
footnote, explaining that this AE is only observed in the paediatric population 6 to 11 years of age.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Part 1 
In Part 1, throughout the study, a total of 6 SAEs occurred, all in either the 50 µg or the 100 µg mRNA-
1273 vaccine group, none in the placebo group. Within 28 days after vaccination two subjects in the 50 
µg dose group reported one SAE each (foreign body ingestion and palpitation). Four SAEs with onset after 
28 days were reported, 3 in the 50 µg dose group, and one in the 100 µg dose group. None of the SAEs 
was considered being vaccine related by the investigator. In the 50 µg dose group one participant had a 
grade 2 optic disc drusen, which occurred 151 days after dose 2 and was ongoing at the time of the data 
snapshot. In addition, 2 other participants in the 50 µg dose group experienced an SAE of grade 3 
appendicitis, 97 and 72 days post-dose 2. In the 100 μg group, 1 participant had an SAE of grade 2 
systemic viral infection of unknown aetiology 101 days post-dose 2. 
The event of palpitations in the 50 µg dose group occurred in a 7-year-old female child with a history of 
palpitations. Initially report stated, that 3 days post-dose 2, the girl experienced a mild SAE of 
palpitations, meeting the SAE criterion of medically significant SAE of special interest. The medical history 
includes palpitations starting one year before. Follow-up information was received 106 days post-dose 2 
(after the data snapshot on 6th October 2021), which included a downgrade of the event by the 
investigator to non-serious. Moreover, the event onset was confirmed as 31 days after receiving the 
second dose of vaccine (not as initially reported 3 days after having received the second dose of vaccine). 
The event onset was changed to > 28 days after dose 2. The participant was seen by a cardiologist 95 
days post dose 2. Results from the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal. The subject was 
placed on a mobile cardiac telemetry 3 lead device for 30 days for monitoring. No treatment for the event 
of palpitations was reported. No action was taken in regard to the IP. Electrocardiogram and 
echocardiogram results were normal, and the child was pending ambulatory Holter monitoring. The 
resolution of the event is unknown. The investigator assessed the event of palpitations to be not related 
to the IP. This can be agreed upon. 
The event of viral infection was reported in a 9-year-old male. On Study Day 133, the participant started 
experiencing a red and blotchy rash on bilateral cheeks, arms, and legs and severe itching on bilateral 
feet which resolved the same day. He presented to the hospital with leg pain/swelling and acute 
abdominal pain. The participant was admitted to the hospital that day for observation. Computed 
tomography with contrast of the abdomen/pelvis and an ultrasound with duplex of the scrotum were 
performed (results not provided). On Study Day 134, the participant started experiencing neck pain. 
Influenza A and B, respiratory viral panel-polymerase chain reaction, and SARS-CoV-2 tests were all 
negative. On Study Day 135, the participant had a peripheral pulse rate of 92 beats per minute and 
oxygen saturation of 95%. Relevant laboratory results (reference range) included white blood cell count 
of 3.7 × 103/uL (4.5-13.5), haemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL (11.5-15.5), platelet count of 141 × 103/μL (150-
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 79/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
400), neutrophils of 50% (25%-78%), lymphocytes of 35% (35%-54%), creatinine of 0.49 mg/dL (0.72-
1.25), and globulin of 2.8 g/dL (1.9-4.3). Urine culture was performed (results not provided). Treatment 
for the event of systemic viral infection included paracetamol and an unknown intravenous antibiotic. The 
event of systemic viral infection was considered to be resolved on Study Day 135. 
The 2nd analysis does not alter the benefit-risk profile. Since the last data cut, there were no new SAEs 
reported in the 50 μg group. The previously reported SAE of palpitations in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group 
was subsequently downgraded to non-serious. This SAE was reported for a 7-year-old female, with a 
medical history of seasonal allergies and palpitations for a year previous to receiving the 1st dose of the 
vaccine and is in detail described above. One new SAE of acute pancreatitis was reported in the 100 μg 
mRNA-1273 group. The SAE occurred in a participant with significant ongoing medical history of 
pancreatic insufficiency, stage 2 chronic kidney disease and haemolytic uremic syndrome, and pancreatic 
pseudocyst. The investigator assessed the event of pancreatitis not to be vaccine related, which can be 
agreed upon. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data cut. 
A previously reported SAE of systemic viral infection was updated to constipation. 
Part 2 
Two SAEs (appendicitis and cellulitis orbital) both not considered being vaccine related were reported in 
the mRNA-1273 vaccine group. No SAEs were reported in the placebo group. The SAE of appendicitis is 
also an AESI. The event was reported for a 7-year-old female and occurred 25 days-post dose 1. On 
Study Day 27, the girl underwent an appendectomy. The event of appendicitis was considered to be 
resolved on Study Day 27. The SAE of cellulitis orbital happened to an 8-year old male 2 days post-dose 
2. The event started on Study day 33 with headache. On Study Day 35 the boy was admitted to hospital. 
CT examination of the orbits with IV contrast showed right maxillary and ethmoid sinusitis with right 
medial orbital wall (lamina papyracea) subperiosteal abscess butting the medial rectus, associated with 
pre- and post-septal cellulitis. Treatment for the event of cellulitis orbital included broad-spectrum 
antibiotics, IV piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium, IV vancomycin, and oral paracetamol. The 
participant was discharged from the hospital Study Day 38. No action was taken in regard to the IP. The 
event of cellulitis orbital was considered to be resolved on Study Day 38. 
The benefit-risk ratio is not altered by the 2nd analysis with regard to SAEs. Since the last data cut 5 new 
SAEs (in 4 participants) were reported in mRNA-1273 group and 2 new SAEs in the Placebo group. None 
of the 5 SAEs was considered being vaccine related. The 5 new SAEs in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group 
include Type 1 diabetes mellitus (study day 63), cellulitis in the left elbow area near an insect bite (study 
day 45), pyelonephritis and urosepsis in one subject on study day 64, and appendicitis on study day 77. 
Regarding the event of Type 1 diabetes mellitus per the investigator, the participant had been 
experiencing increased thirst, urination, and hunger prior to screening for study entry. The 2 new SAEs in 
the placebo group included affective disorder and COVID-19. 
The CHMP noted from the submitted documents that as of data snapshot overall 8 SAEs were reported in 
part 1 and part 2 together. All SAEs occurred either in the 50 µg or the 100 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group, none in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were considered to be vaccine related by the 
investigator, which is agreed. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESI were pre-specified in the CTP and were assessed as those occurring within 28 days of any injection 
and across the study duration. Events of clinical interest related to hypersensitivity, potential cardiac 
aetiology, and myocarditis and pericarditis are discussed in a separate subsection in this AR. AESI are 
listed in Table 39.

As of 6th October 2021, overall, 5 AESI were reported throughout the study in part 1, none of them 
considered being vaccine related. In addition to the 5 AESI, though not meeting AESI criteria, one event 
of palpitation was reported as an AESI. This AESI is described in the SAE section, was reported for a 7-
year old girl, and was downgraded to non-serious later.5 AESI occurred beyond the time frame of 28 days 
after vaccination; the event of palpitation occurred within this time window. The event of palpitation 
fulfilled SAE criteria and occurred in a 7-year-old female in the 50 µg dose group. The event was not 
considered being vaccine related by the investigator. This can be agreed upon. Details are described in 
the SAE section in this AR. The AESI events that occurred beyond day 28 post-vaccination in the 50 µg 
dose group include 2 cases of appendicitis on study day 125 and study day 100, and one case of non-
cardiac chest pain on day 72 post-dose 2. The event of non-cardiac chest pain was considered being 
vaccine related by the investigator. The narrative has been submitted but does not contain any further 
clinical information. Taking the time to onset into account, a relationship is considered unlikely. No AESI 
occurring within 28 days after vaccination were reported in the 100 µg dose group. Beyond 28 days after 
any dose, 2 AESIs were reported, both not considered being vaccine related, which can be agreed upon 
based on time to onset. One mild event of bullous impetigo was reported in a 6-year-old male 48 days 
post-dose 2 and one event of ageusia reported in a 11-year-old female 28 days post-dose 2. The event of 
mild ageusia was accompanied by pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, and oropharyngeal pain. No 
information on COVID-19 diagnostic is available in the submitted narrative. 
As of 10th November 2021, one new AESI of acute pancreatitis, which is described in the SAE section of 
this AR was reported in the Part 1 100 μg mRNA-1273 group. This event was not considered being 
vaccine related by the investigator, which can be agreed upon. 
Part 2 
In part 2 of the study, 1 AESI was reported by one subject in the vaccine group and 2 AESI by one 
subject in the placebo group. None of the events was considered being vaccine related. The AESI in the 
vaccine group was an event of appendicitis occurring 25 days post-dose 1 in a 7-year-old female. The 2 
AESI in the placebo group were COVID-19 associated ageusia and anosmia reported in a 11-year old 
male. All 3 events were considered to be resolved. 
No relevant new AESIS were reported for the 2nd analysis, that might alter the benefit-risk profile. A total 
of 4 new AESIs was reported in Part 2, 3 in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group and 1 in the placebo group. The 
new events in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group include appendicitis (described in the SAE section above), 
loss of taste, and loss of smell and taste in another subject. For the AESI of isolated loss of taste no 
information of underlying COVID-19 is reported in the narrative. For the subject with combined loss of 
smell and taste, it was reported that the participant had these events without having a positive COVID-19 
test result. Associated events were nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, and oropharyngeal pain. One new AESI 
in the placebo group was loss of taste, associated with COVID-19. None of the new AESIs were assessed 
as being vaccine related, which can be agreed upon. 
No event of MIS-C was reported throughout the study until the 2nd IA data cut-off. 
The CHMP noted that a total of 9 AESI in 8 subjects were reported throughout the study in part 1 and 
part 2 together. Based on the submitted information, none of the events are considered to be vaccine 
related. Although palpitations were not considered AESI based on definitions above, an investigator 
reported an event of palpitations as an AESI. It should be noted that 2 more AEs of palpitation were 
reported in 2 subjects in the 100 µg dose group. The events are discussed in the Cardiomyopathy SMQ 
section below. 
Events of clinical interest based on the narrow and the narrow and broad hypersensitivity 
standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries (SMQs) of Hypersensitivity

All unsolicited AEs within the narrow and the narrow and broad hypersensitivity standard Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries (SMQs), Version 23 were summarised for Part 1 and Part 2 of 
the study. 
Part 1 
As of 6th October 2021, no cases of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reaction were reported in part 
1. Hypersensitivity reactions were slightly more frequent reported in the 100 µg dose group compared 
with the 50 µg dose group. Overall, 23 subjects (6.1%) in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group and 31 (8.4%) in 
the 100 μg group experienced events indicative of hypersensitivity reaction. The most commonly reported 
events by PT in the 50 µg dose group were seasonal allergy (6 [1.6%] participants), injection site rash (3 
[0.8%] participants), urticaria (3 [0.8%] participants)/urticaria papular (1 [0.3%], vaccination site rash 
(2 [0.5%] participants), and sneezing. In the 100 μg group in Part 1, the most commonly reported events 
were injection site rash (7 [1.9%] participants), seasonal allergy (5 [1.3%] participants), and sneezing (5 
[1.3%] participants). 2 events were reported on the day of or day after dose administration. These 
events were seasonal allergies (not considered being vaccine related) and urticaria. The event of urticaria 
occurred in an 8-year-old female in the 50 µg dose group and started the day after the second dose. The 
event was reported as mild, related and reported as resolved the next day 
Beyond 48 hours of any dose, 2 events were reported with PTs of bronchial hyperreactivity and wheezing. 
The event of bronchial hyperreactivity was reported in the 50 µg dose group in a 11-year-old male 
participant with history of reactive airways, 45 days after the second dose. The event was considered 
related by the investigator, the late onset however makes the event rather unlikely being vaccine related. 
The event of wheezing in the 50 µg dose group was reported in a 11-year-old male with past medical 
history of mild intermittent asthma, 28 days after the second dose and reported as moderate and not 
related. The event resolved 4 days after it started. Moreover, one event of urticaria papular in the 50 µg 
dose group occurred in a 11-year-old female with history of seasonal allergies and facial maculopapular 
rash. The event started on Day 9 post-dose 1 and was considered being vaccine related by the 
investigator. The girl had 50-mm redness at vaccine site and small sporadic papular lesions on hands, 
elbows and feet. No additional symptoms were reported with the rash. The participant had previously 
reported a facial rash prior to the delayed skin reaction that was thought to be related to her seasonal 
allergies. The second dose was withdrawn due to the event of urticaria papular. The girl continued 
participation in the trial. Additional 2 participants with 3 events indicative of hypersensitivity were 
reported in the 50 μg group of Part 1. In the 100 μg group, there were 5 additional participants reporting 
a total of 6 events indicative of hypersensitivity. 
The CHMP noted that in part 1, no case indicative of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reaction has 
been reported. The reported AEs indicative of hypersensitivity were mild or moderate and resolved. One 
subject has been withdrawn from dose 2 due to urticaria popular occurring on day 9 post-dose 1. The 
following AEs indicating hypersensitivity were considered being vaccine related in the 50 µg dose group: 
injection site rash (3 subjects), vaccination site rash (2 subjects), urticaria (1 subject)/urticarial popular 
(1 subject). In the 100 µg dose group injection site rash (7 subjects), vaccination site rash (2 subjects), 
and pruritus, dermatitis, rash, rash macular, and rash pruritic (1 subject each) were considered being 
vaccine related. Currently in the SmPC all forms of hypersensitivity reaction except of rash, which is 
mentioned separately, are covered under the PT hypersensitivity. 2 events in the 50 µg dose group were 
reported on the day of or day after dose administration, seasonal allergies and urticaria. The event of 
urticaria occurred in an 8-year-old female and started 1 day post-dose 2. The event was reported as 
related, mild and as resolved the next day. It is agreed that relatedness is possible. One event of 
bronchial hyperreactivity was reported in a 11-year-old male participant with history of reactive airways, 
45 days after the second dose. The event was considered related, mild and reported as resolved 2 days 
after it started. The late onset makes the event rather unlikely related. One event of non-serious 
moderate urticaria papular occurred in a 11-year-old female with history of seasonal allergies and facial 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 83/121 
 
 
 
 
  
maculopapular rash. The event started on Day 9 post-dose 1 and was reported as related. The participant 
had 50-mm redness at vaccine site and small sporadic papular lesions on hands, elbows and feet. No 
additional symptoms were reported with the rash. The participant had previously reported a facial rash 
prior to the delayed skin reaction that was thought to be related to her seasonal allergies. The girl 
recovered within 6 days of the onset of the event. The second dose was not given due to the event of 
urticaria papular. Due to the predisposition for allergies and sporadic papular lesions causality cannot be 
excluded. Although symptom onset of delayed hypersensitivity reactions can occur up to 2 to 3 weeks 
after trigger event, delayed-type reactions occur commonly within hours or days after exposure.  
Part 2 
No cases of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reaction were reported in part 2. Hypersensitivity 
reactions were more frequent reported in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the 
placebo group. Overall, 98 subjects (3.3%) in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group and only 14 (1.4%) in the 
placebo group experienced events indicative of hypersensitivity reaction. 58 subjects (1.9%) versus only 
2 subjects (0.2%) in the 2 groups reported hypersensitivity reactions considered being vaccine related. Of 
the related events, the most frequent PTs were injections site reaction (injection site rash, injection site 
hypersensitivity, injection site urticaria and vaccination site rash). The most frequently reported PT 
indicative of hypersensitivity, not associated with injection site reaction, was urticaria. 
Two participants were withdrawn from vaccine dose 2 due to AEs indicative of hypersensitivity. One 
participant, a 9-year-old male with history of seasonal allergies, was discontinued from study vaccine due 
to non-serious events of moderate urticaria on day 24 post-dose 1 and mild wheezing starting on day 29 
post-dose 1. The participant recovered from the wheezing 3 days after the onset of the event. The event 
of urticaria was still resolving and the participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data 
snapshot. The event of wheezing was not considered being vaccine related. Results of the causality 
assessment for the event of urticaria has not yet been reported. The other participant, a 10-year-old 
male with history of chronic kidney disease, experienced a non-serious, mild AE of rash on Day 10 
following dose 1, which led to withdrawal of the study IP. The participant was continuing follow-up in the 
study at the time of data snapshot. The event was considered to be resolved on Day 18. 
None of the urticaria AEs started on the day of vaccination, but one event of urticaria considered being 
vaccine related occurred in a 6-year old female (hives on body with the exception of face) and started on 
day 2 (i.e. 1 day post-dose 2). The event resolved the day after. A causality cannot be excluded. A total 
of 13 events were reported in the mRNA-1273 group on the day of or day after vaccination. The following 
are described in more detail here: 
An episode of asthma occurred the same day of the second dose and was reported as not related. This 
episode occurred in a child with history of asthma and multiple allergies who was already on albuterol. 
One event of flushing occurred within 15 minutes of dosing and lasted less than 30 min. It was reported 
as mild and considered being vaccine related. Without further information it is not possible to distinguish 
between a vaccine or a procedural related AE. One participant had more than one event indicative of 
hypersensitivity reported the same day or the day after any dose. An event of bronchospasm was 
reported in a 11-year-old male with history of asthma 8 days after the second dose. It was reported as 
related, moderate, and resolved the same day. The late onset however makes a causal relationship 
unlikely. An event of periorbital swelling was reported in a 9-year-old male 2 days after receiving the first 
dose, and one event of eye swelling in an eight year old female 6 days post-dose 1. Both events were 
considered being vaccine related. Causality for the case of periorbital swelling cannot be finally assessed 
based on the limited information. Eye swelling starting on day 6 is rather unlikely to be vaccine related. 
Both events were non-serious and resolved. 
In the combined 50 µg dose group (Part 1+Part 2, n=3,387), 121 subjects (3.6%) reported 136 potential 
hypersensitivity AES. The most commonly occurring PTs were injections site reaction (injection site rash, 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 84/121 
 
 
 
 
  
injection site hypersensitivity, injection site urticaria or vaccination site rash) and seasonal allergies. Of 
note, the incidence differed between subjects in Part 1, 6.1% of participants receiving 50 µg reported 
such events compared to 3.3% in the 50 µg group in Part 2. In the vaccine group, approximately 50% of 
events were considered as related to IP, while only two events in the placebo group were considered as 
related. No event of anaphylaxis occurred during the study until cut-off.  
The number of subjects reporting PTs in the broad scope SMQ Angioedema were 3 (0.3%) in the placebo 
group and 16 (0.5%) in the vaccine group in Part 2, versus 5 (1.3%) subjects in the 50 µg group and 2 
(0.5%) in the 100 µg group of Part 1, driven by the PT of urticaria. These rates are higher than those 
observed in children 12-<18, who reported such events at a rate of 0.3% in both the placebo and the 
vaccine arm. In conclusion, the incidence of adverse events associated with hypersensitivity appears to 
be slightly higher in the younger children, but are mainly driven by cutaneous reactions and seasonal 
allergies. As of 10th November 2021, there were an additional 42 participants reporting 43 events 
indicative of hypersensitivity in the mRNA-1273 group. In the placebo group, there was an increase of 9 
participants reporting 11 events. 
The CHMP noted that no cases of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported in either 
parts of the study. The most frequently reported AE indicative of hypersensitivity and not associated with 
local reaction is the AE of urticaria. Urticaria is currently not included as AE in section 4.8 but could be 
considered as being covered by the broader term rash. Two participants in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
of part 2 however have been withdrawn from dose 2 due to AEs indicative of hypersensitivity. One AE of 
urticaria started on day 24 and was ongoing at the time of data snapshot. The other event was rash that 
started on day 10 and resolved on day 18. Both events were non-serious. Although symptom onset of 
delayed hypersensitivity reactions can occur up to 2 to 3 weeks after trigger event, delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reactions occur commonly within hours or days after exposure. Both AEs were non-
serious. Causality for the AE of periorbital swelling 2 days post-dose 2 in the 50 µg dose group in part 2 
cannot finally be established based on the available clinical information.  
Assessment of myocarditis and pericarditis 
On July 09, 2021, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluded to recommend 
listing myocarditis and pericarditis as a side effect in the product information of both currently authorised 
mRNA vaccines, due to the occurrence of very rare cases in the post-marketing phase. On Dec 03, 2021, 
after a review of two large European epidemiological studies (Epi-phare, FR and Nordic registry data, DK, 
SE, NO, FI) the PRAC confirmed that the risk for both of these conditions is overall “very rare”, meaning 
that up to one in 10,000 vaccinated people may be affected. Additionally, the data show that the 
increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination is highest in younger males. 
To perform an enhanced surveillance on the events of myocarditis and pericarditis the CTP has been 
updated. Two overlapping approaches were used to interrogate all TEAEs. This included: 
1.  narrow and broad cardiomyopathy standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries 
(MedDRA SMQs) 
2.  an algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in the CDC 
working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis (Gargano et al. 2021) 
Sites were instructed to ask the caregiver the following question: “Has your child experienced any of the 
following symptoms since we last spoke? Chest pain, pressure or discomfort; Shortness of breath, fast 
breathing at rest, or any pain with breathing; Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.”

– Safety Set), source: Table 36 clinical overview 
During the 1st analysis with cut-off 6th October 2021, no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were 
reported in part 1 of the study. Three events with PTs included in the narrow and broad scope 
cardiomyopathy SMQs were reported in 3 (0.8%) participants in the 50 μg group and 5 events were 
reported in 5 (1.3%) participants in the 100 μg group, respectively. The 3 events in the 50 µg dose group 
included 2 cases of dyspnoea, and one case of palpitation. One case of dyspnoea occurred in an 11-year-
old male together with symptoms indicative of upper respiratory tract infection (non-serious, mild chest 
discomfort and musculoskeletal discomfort (back pain). The other event of dyspnoea occurred in an 11-
year-old female with a medical history of asthma 23 days post-dose 1. The event of dyspnoea occurred 
together with the non-serious moderate AE of wheezing, chills, nasal congestion, and oropharyngeal pain. 
Other relevant non-serious AEs reported by the participant included: otitis externa, cough and fatigue, all 
prior to the event of dyspnoea. The third event (palpitation) occurred in a 7-year-old female with a 
medical history of palpitation 31 days post-dose 2 and was not considered being vaccine related by the 
investigator. Details are described in the SAE section of this AR. None of the AEs matching with PTs 
defined for enhance surveillance for myocarditis/pericarditis was considered being vaccine related by the 
investigators, which can be agreed. 
In the 100 μg group there were 5 events of interest reported by 5 subjects within the cardiomyopathy 
SMQ. 2 events of dyspnoea, 2 events of palpitations, and 1 event of chest pain. Both cases of dyspnoea 
were not considered being vaccine related by the investigators. One case of mild dyspnoea was reported 
for an 8-year-old male, starting 92 days post-dose 2. The dyspnoea was accompanied by events of 
headache, cough, nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain and rhinorrhoea. The other event of non-serious 
mild dyspnoea occurred in a 9-year-old participant starting 2 days post-dose 2 together with non-serious, 
mild chest discomfort and musculoskeletal discomfort (back pain), all of which resolved within ‘a few 
hours’ according to the parents. The child had a relevant history of asthma for which he was receiving 
albuterol and budesonide. The first event of palpitation occurred on the day of receiving dose 2, was 
reported for an 11-year-old female and was considered being vaccine related by the investigator. The 
event was associated with an anxiety reaction. According to the parents the child felt like she could not 
catch her breath upon returning home and felt her heart skipped a few beats for a brief time. O2 sat and 
pulse was normal at home; per the parent. No other cardiac symptoms like chest pain, syncope or near 
syncope, or chest wall pain were reported. Concomitant medication included paracetamol and ibuprofen 
(due to chills and elevated temperature, according to the MAH). Symptoms resolved the same day. In 
contrast to the investigator, the MAH did not assess the event of palpitation as being vaccine related, 
which is supported. There is Causality cannot be finally demonstrated, it is also possible, that the event of 
palpitation is an anxiety-related reaction. The second AE of palpitation in part 2 was also considered being 
vaccine related by the investigator and was reported for a 10-year-old female, who reported palpitation 
on exertion 6 days after dose 2. Concomitant medication ongoing at the time of the event of palpitations 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 86/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
included ibuprofen given because of pain at injection site, and headache. Palpitation resolved on the same 
day. The MAH did not agree with the investigator`s conclusion, which is supported. Causality cannot be 
finally demonstrated, because the event happened upon exertion. One event of chest pain (moderate) 
was reported in a 9-year-old male occurring 17 days after dose 2 and resolving the same day. The child 
had a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for which he received the concomitant 
medication of Methylphenidate hydrochloride, which could also be a cause for chest pain/chest 
discomfort. The chest pain occurred while exercising. ECG and a chest x-ray were performed, both of 
which were unremarkable. The investigator considered the event related, which is not supported by the 
investigator. It is agreed that causality to the vaccine cannot be established, due to concomitant 
medication and exertion. The results of unremarkable cardiac evaluation together with an onset of 17 
days and resolution the same day do not indicate myocarditis or pericarditis. 
The CHMP noted that no case of myocarditis or pericarditis was reported in part A of the study. A total of 
8 AEs in 8 subjects were reported within the cardiomyopathy MedDRA SMQ. The events included 
dyspnoea, palpitation, and chest pain. The CHMP considered that these events are not indicative of 
myocarditis or pericarditis. 2 events of palpitation and 1 event of chest pain in the 100 µg dose group 
were considered being vaccine related by the investigator, but not by the MAH. The MAH’s assessment of 
the events is supported based on the submitted clinical information. In summary, none of the events 
reported within MedDRA cardiomyopathy SMQ is indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis and none of the 
events is considered being vaccine related. 
Part 2 
All events reported within the MedDRA cardiomyopathy SMQ are summarised in Table 41. 
Table 41: Summary of PTs Reported by Subjects within the MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQs (Part 2 – 
Safety Set) 
Three events of chest pain occurred in 3 subjects, one that occurred together with dyspnoea was 
considered being vaccine related by the investigator.  
One report of chest pain in an 8-year-old female with a medical history of asthma for which her 
medication included albuterol. It should be noted that β2-sympathomimetic medication can result in 
tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitation. The event occurred 7 days post-dose 1 and was resolved 3 days 
later. The event was not considered being vaccine related by the investigator. The girl received dose 2 of 
mRNA-1273 with no additional AEs reported. A second report of chest pain happened to an 11-year-old 
male 2 days post-dose 2 was described as 2 brief discrete episodes of chest pain, occurring a couple of 
days apart with each episode lasting only seconds in duration. This child had a medical history of seasonal 
allergies, asthma and anxiety and was described as clearly anxious on examination; otherwise, physical 
examination and ECG were reported as unremarkable. The Investigator assessed this event as not being 
vaccine related. A third report of chest pain was reported for a 7-year-old male and occurred 2 days post-
dose 2, resolving within 4 days. The chest pain was described as mild and intermittent. The event was 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 87/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
accompanied by mild dyspnoea starting also 2 days post-dose 2 and resolved on the same day. The child 
had no relevant medical history. Per the investigator the participant was evaluated in the emergency 
department where he was considered to be in good health with no respiratory or cardiac issues identified. 
Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed and excluded cardiac origin for the chest pain and 
dyspnoea. Concomitant medication at the time of the events of dyspnoea and chest pain included: 
children’s ibuprofen (headache, muscle aches), children’s paracetamol (body aches in neck region), and 
paracetamol (shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain).The event was considered to be related to 
the IP by the investigator, which was agreed by the MAH. 
6 events of dyspnoea were reported in 5 subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group. One of these events 
of dyspnoea was considered being vaccine related by the investigator and occurred in the 7-year-old male 
described above, together with intermittent chest pain. The 5 remaining events (in 4 subjects) are 
described here in detail. 
A 6-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies experienced difficulty breathing due to 
seasonal allergies occurring 6 days post-dose 1 which resolved the same day. Concomitant medications 
included albuterol and loratadine. The events were considered not related by the investigator. A 9-year-
old male with a medical history of seasonal allergies and ADHD reported 2 events of dyspnoea both 
occurring 13 days post-dose 1, together with fatigue, oropharyngeal pain and cough. The events were 
reported as “difficulty breathing” (moderate) and once as “shortness of breath” (mild), and both occurred 
and both resolved on the same day. Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine (seasonal 
allergies), fluticasone (seasonal allergies), risperidone (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined), 
atomoxetine (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined), paracetamol (minor aches/pains related 
to childhood injuries/conditions), paracetamol (headache), and cetirizine(seasonal allergies). The events 
were considered not related by the investigator, compatible with possible respiratory tract infection as the 
cause of the dyspnoea given the fatigue, oropharyngeal pain and cough. A 9-year-old female with no 
relevant medical history, reported dyspnoea one day post-dose 2 which resolved the next day. 
Concurrent symptoms included headache and a urinary tract infection. The event was not considered 
being vaccine related by the investigator. The concurrent occurrence of headache and urinary tract 
infection may have resulted in feeling of malaise, which could increase the perception of subjective 
symptoms such as dyspnoea. A 9-year-old female with unknown medical history, reported dyspnoea 21 
days post-dose 1 which resolved in 3 days. The participant also experienced concurrent rhinorrhoea and 
cough. The constellation of dyspnoea, rhinorrhoea and cough are more compatible with possible 
respiratory tract infection than potential myocarditis or pericarditis. The event was considered not related 
to the vaccine by the investigator. 
The last event is an event of syncope reported in a 10-year-old female with medical history of asthma, 
who experienced syncope on the day of dose 1 and which resolved the same day. No other information 
was provided. The event was considered not related to the vaccine by the investigator. 
The CHMP noted that in part 2 of the study 8 events within the MedDRA SMQ occurred in 10 subjects. 
This included 3 events of chest pain, 6 events of dyspnoea (one dyspnoea together with chest pain in one 
subject, 2 events of dyspnoea in one subject), and one event of syncope occurred. Except for the event of 
chest pain together with dyspnoea occurring in one subject (a 7-year-old boy) none of the events were 
considered being vaccine related. The event of dyspnoea and chest pain occurred 2 days post-dose 2, 
resolving on the same day (dyspnoea) and within 4 days (chest pain). The chest pain was described as 
intermittent. The child had no relevant medical history. Per the investigator the participant was evaluated 
in the emergency department where he was considered to be in good health with no respiratory or 
cardiac issues identified. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed and excluded cardiac 
origin for the chest pain and dyspnoea. Concomitant medication at the time of the events of dyspnoea 
and chest pain included: children’s Motrin/Ibuprofen (headache, muscle aches), children’s 
Tylenol/paracetamol (body aches in neck region), and Tylenol (shortness of breath and intermittent chest 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 88/121 
 
 
 
 
  
pain). The provided information, particularly the unremarkable cardiac investigations (ECG and cardiac 
echo), do not indicate myocarditis or pericarditis. Vaccine relatedness cannot be excluded, but on the 
other hand not finally be confirmed. The CHMP agrees not to include dyspnoea and chest pain into section 
4.8 solely based on these solicited events.  
Additional Analysis of Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
Part 1 
In this additional analysis (algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in 
the CDC working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis) only one additional relevant 
PT was identified in part 1 of the study. This event was report for a 10- year-old male in the 50 µg mRNA-
1273 dose group, with medical history of obstructive sleep-related breathing disorders. The participant 
received the first dose on Study Day 1 and the second dose on Study Day 30. Sixty days after the 2nd 
dose of the vaccine, on Study Day 90, the participant experienced a non-serious mild AE of 
musculoskeletal chest pain (musculoskeletal chest pain). Other relevant non-serious AEs reported by the 
participant included: viral infection (viral like illness; prior to the event of musculoskeletal chest pain) and 
arthropod bite (insect bites on chest and legs; prior to the event of musculoskeletal chest pain). No action 
was taken in regard to the IP. The event of musculoskeletal chest pain was considered to be resolved on 
Study Day 119. The investigator assessed the event of musculoskeletal chest pain to be not related to the 
IP. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data cut. 
Part 2: 
In Part 2, this additional analysis identified 5 participants with relevant PTs, all in the mRNA-1273 group, 
1 with angina pectoris, 2 with chest discomfort and 2 with musculoskeletal chest pain. Angina pectoris 
was reported for a 10-year-old male in the mRNA-1273 group, occurring one day post-dose 1 and 
resolving on the same day. His parents reported him feeling squeezing around the heart. The next 
morning, the participant reported the same squeezing feeling approximately 10-12 times and it resolved 
after eating breakfast. The participant was brought into the clinic for cardiac evaluation. A Troponin level 
was drawn, ECG 12 Lead and Pediatric Transthoracic Echo complete with Doppler/CF were performed. All 
three tests were within normal limits and Myocarditis was ruled out. The event was considered being 
vaccine related by the investigator, and the second dose of the vaccine was given as planned without 
additional AEs. 
Two events of chest discomfort in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group, both not considered being vaccine 
related by the investigator were identified within this search according to the MAH. One event of chest 
discomfort occurred in a 9-year-old male with a history of anxiety reported on the day of administration 
of dose 1. No other non-serious AEs were reported by the participant. No action was taken in regard to 
the IP. The event of chest discomfort was considered to be resolved on Study Day 3. A diagnosis of non-
cardiac chest pressure related to worsening anxiety was made. The participant received dose 2 of the 
vaccine as planned with no other reported events. The second event of chest discomfort in the 50 µg 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group occurred in a 10-years old female with no medical history reported. The event 
occurred four days after dose 2, on Study day 27 and was described as non-serious mild AE of chest 
discomfort (chest tightness). According to her guardian the chest discomfort lasted for less than 24 hours 
and symptoms resolved without any treatment. Concomitant medication or concomitant procedures 
ongoing at the time of the event of chest discomfort included: Tylenol (i.e. paracetamol, for chest 
tightness). No action was taken in regard to the IP. The investigator assessed the event of chest 
discomfort to be not related to the IP. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data 
cut. The listing revealed a third case of chest discomfort in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group in part 2, 
reported by a 9-year-old male. The narrative was subsequently submitted by the MAH. The event started 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 89/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
and ended on the day of administration of dose 1 and was considered being vaccine related by the 
investigator. The event was reported as chest tightness, that lasted 25 minutes, with no wheezing, not 
worsening with deep breath, vital signs were stable, and chest tightness was gone after reassurance. The 
event resolved the same day. No other adverse events were reported at that time. Based on the available 
information the event is not indicative of myo-or pericarditis. The MAH evaluated the event as 
“immunisation stress-related response (ISRR)” which describes a range of symptoms and signs that may 
arise around immunisation that are related to “anxiety” and not to the vaccine product. These reactions 
are described as AEFI arising from anxiety about immunisation and include vasovagal-mediated reactions, 
hyperventilation-mediated reactions and stress-related psychiatric reactions or disorders. It is agreed that 
an anxiety related reaction is possible and a vaccine relatedness cannot be finally concluded on.  
In addition, there were 2 reports of musculoskeletal chest pain identified in 2 participants, both in the 
mRNA-1273 group and both not considered being vaccine related. An 8-year-old male with concurrent 
medical history of URTI, fever and concomitant medications of azithromycin, diphenhydramine and 
guaifenesin, reported musculoskeletal chest pain occurring 13 days post-dose 2 which resolved the 
following day. The participant was evaluated by the paediatrician who determined that the event was 
unlikely to be due to cardiac origin. It can be agreed, that the event is likely due to the concurrent URTI. 
A second report was a 7-year-old male with medical history of chronic lung disease, retinopathy of 
prematurity and asthma, who reported musculoskeletal chest pain 22 days post-dose 2. This event is 
ongoing. No further medical details are provided. One event of non-cardiac chest pain was reported in a 
11-year-old male 2 days post-dose 2 in part 2. This child had a medical history of seasonal allergies, 
asthma and anxiety and was described as clearly anxious on examination. No associated diaphoresis, 
dyspnoea, radiation or pallor were described. Myocarditis or pericarditis were excluded by physical 
examination and ECG, both was reported as unremarkable. The Investigator assessed this event as 
‘possibly musculoskeletal in origin (e.g., costochondritis) and more likely related to a hypervigilant state 
secondary to anxiety. The event resolved and was considered mild and non-serious, and not being 
vaccine related by the study investigator, which can be agreed upon. 
The CHMP noted the MAH summary of the clinical information available for all 3 participants (one case 
considered to be vaccine related by the investigator, and the other two cases being considered not to be 
vaccine related). The MAH assessed all 3 events as cases of “immunization anxiety-related reaction” or 
how they are now described “immunization stress-related response (ISRR)” which describe a range of 
symptoms and signs that may arise around immunisation that are related to “anxiety” and not to the 
vaccine product. These reactions are described as AEFI arising from anxiety about immunisation and 
include vasovagal-mediated reactions, hyperventilation-mediated reactions and stress-related psychiatric 
reactions or disorders, and cover the entire spectrum of manifestations (symptoms and signs) of a stress 
response rather than a single symptom, anxiety. Chest pain and or chest discomfort as the only 
manifestation or adverse event, are part of the range of symptoms that can be present during an ISRR 
event. The MAH assessment can be agreed upon. Based on the available clinical information a relatedness 
to the mRNA-1273 cannot be concluded on. The CHMP agreed not to include the AE of chest pain or chest 
comfort into the SmPC. None of the events is indicative of myo-or pericarditis, based on the submitted 
clinical information. 
Summarising evaluation of the Assessment of myocarditis and pericarditis 
Following the identified safety signal of events of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with 
mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines the MAH amended the CTP to implement an enhanced surveillance on 
the events of myocarditis and pericarditis. A careful analysis based on two overlapping approaches used 
to interrogate all AEs indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis has been performed. This included: 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 90/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
1.  narrow and broad cardiomyopathy standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries 
(MedDRA SMQs) and  
2.  an algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in the CDC 
working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis (Gargano et al. 2021) 
AEs detected within this search included cases of chest pain, chest discomfort, angina, dyspnoea, 
syncope, palpitations, and musculoskeletal chest pain. Overall, only 2 participants in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group (both in part 2, i.e. they received the 50 µg dose) reported more than one PT indicative of 
myocarditis or pericarditis concurrently. Both narratives have been provided. The available clinical 
information does not indicate that the events are indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis.  
One is a 7-year-old male who experienced mild intermittent chest pain on day 2 post-dose 2. The event 
was accompanied by mild dyspnoea starting also 2 days post-dose 2 and resolving on the same day. The 
child had no relevant medical history. Per the investigator the participant was evaluated in the emergency 
department where he was considered to be in good health with no respiratory or cardiac issues identified. 
Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed and excluded cardiac origin for the chest pain and 
dyspnoea. Concomitant medication at the time of the events of dyspnoea and chest pain included: 
children’s ibuprofen (headache, muscle aches), children’s paracetamol (body aches in neck region), and 
paracetamol (shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain). The event was considered to be related to 
the IP by the investigator, which was agreed by the MAH. 
The other one is a 9-year-old male with a medical history of seasonal allergies and ADHD reported 2 
events of dyspnoea both occurring 13 days post-dose 1, together with fatigue, oropharyngeal pain and 
cough. The events were reported as “difficulty breathing” (moderate) and once as “shortness of breath” 
(mild), and both occurred, and both resolved on the same day. Concomitant medications included 
diphenhydramine (seasonal allergies), fluticasone (seasonal allergies), risperidone (attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, combined), atomoxetine (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined), 
paracetamol (minor aches/pains related to childhood injuries/conditions), paracetamol (headache), and 
cetirizine (seasonal allergies). The events were considered not related by the investigator, compatible 
with possible respiratory tract infection as the cause of the dyspnoea given the fatigue, oropharyngeal 
pain and cough. 
No other participant reported more than one PT indicative of myo-or pericarditis. 
Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful 
enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. In summary, the 
submitted clinical data do not reveal any case of myo-or pericarditis up to the data snapshot. The sample 
size however is too small to finally assess the safety signal of myo-and pericarditis. 
Update on myocarditis/pericarditis (Cut-off date 10th November 2021) 
Part 1 
There have not been any repots of myocarditis or pericarditis as of 10th November 2021 in Part 1. 
Moreover, there were no new events identified in Part 1 under the MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQs.  
Part 2 
As of 10th November 2021, there were 5 new events of clinical interest included in the MedDRA 
Cardiomyopathy SMQs, 4 in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and 1 in the placebo group (3:1 
randomisation). Narratives were provided. None of the events was indicative of myo-or pericarditis or 
considered being vaccine related.  
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 91/121 
 
 
 
 
  
Subsequently in one subject with 2 reported episodes of dyspnoea on the same day, the events were 
updated to fever and streptococcal infection. An additional event of dyspnoea was updated to a non-
serious mild AE of respiratory disorder (upper respiratory illness, aetiology unknown). 
In summary the evaluation of cardiomyopathy SMQ and additional analysis of myocarditis and pericarditis 
performed within the 2nd analysis did not reveal a case of myo-or pericarditis, neither in part 1 nor in part 
2 of trial P204. 
Laboratory findings 
No scheduled laboratory assessments for safety were implemented in the study.  
Safety in special populations 
The incidence of unsolicited adverse events is comparable for males and females, both with regard to 
those AEs considered related to IP and to AEs irrespective of relationship. 
Similarly, for seropositive vs. seronegative trial participants, the incidences of unsolicited AEs are overall 
comparable, with the caveat that the size of the seropositive group was fairly small. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions were not evaluated in this trial. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Part 1 
One 11-year-old female in the 50 µg dose group with history of seasonal allergies and facial 
maculopapular rash did not receive the second dose of mRNA-1273 because of a non-serious, moderate 
AE of urticaria papular. The event started on study day 9 and was considered being vaccine related by the 
investigator. The girl had 50-mm redness at vaccine site and small sporadic papular lesions on hands, 
elbows and feet. No additional symptoms were reported with the rash. The participant had previously 
reported a facial rash prior to the delayed skin reaction that was thought to be related to her seasonal 
allergies. The second dose was withdrawn due to the event of urticaria papular. The girl continued 
participation in the trial. As of 10th November 2021, no additional participants have been withdrawn due 
to AEs in Part 1.  
Part 2 
Two participants in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group were discontinued from the second vaccine dose, but 
continued participation in the study. One participant (generalised rash all over body), a 9-year-old male 
with history of seasonal allergies, was discontinued from study vaccine due to non-serious events of 
moderate urticaria on study day 24 and mild wheezing starting on study day 29. The participant 
recovered from the wheezing 3 days after the onset of the event. The AE of wheezing was not considered 
being vaccine related by the investigator. The event of urticaria was still resolving and results from the 
causality assessment were not reported. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the 
data snapshot. The other participant, a 10-year-old male with history of chronic kidney disease, 
experienced a non-serious, mild AE of rash on study Day 10. The participant was continuing follow-up in 
the study at the time of data snapshot. The event was considered to be resolved on Day 18. Causality 
assessment for this event has not been reported. 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 92/121 
 
 
 
 
  
One 8-year-old male participant in the 50 µg dose group in Part 2 was discontinued from the trial 20 days 
post-dose 2 because of an event of inflammatory bowel disease. The boy had received the first dose of 50 
μg mRNA-1273 on Study Day 1 and the second vaccine dose on Study Day 30. 20 days post-dose 1 
(study day 50), he experienced a moderate treatment-emergent adverse event of inflammatory bowel 
disease. The boy had a past medical history of seizure disorder treated with the anticonvulsant 
levetiracetam, headaches treated with ibuprofen, and occasional abdominal pain. According to the mother 
he had occasional abdominal pain for many years, but has never been worked up for diagnosis until that 
date. The participant was withdrawn from the study because of the mother`s decision. 63 days post-dose 
1additional information was received from the investigator’s site noting that an endoscopy failed to 
indicate IBD, but did identify granulomas. Additional immunology and genetics testing revealed that the 
child had no immune response to previous routine vaccinations. The new possible diagnosis is Common 
Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). 
As of 10th November 2021, there were 3 new AEs that led to withdrawal from vaccination and/or from the 
study; 1 in the 50 μg mRNA-1273 group (Rash) and 2 in the Placebo group (asymptomatic COVID-19; 
and symptomatic COVID-19). 
The CHMP noted that no cases of anaphylaxis or severe or serious AE indicative of hypersensitivity 
occurred up to data snapshot. 3 participants in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group (one in part 1 and 2 
in part 2) however were withdrawn from dose 2 due to AEs indicative of hypersensitivity (urticaria 
papular, urticaria, and rash). Two of the 3 subjects had predisposing factors (history of seasonal allergy). 
None of the events was serious or severe. All AEs had a rather delayed onset (study day 9, day 24, and 
day 10). Although symptom onset of delayed hypersensitivity reactions can occur up to 2 to 3 weeks after 
trigger event, delayed-type reactions occur commonly within hours or days after exposure. The 50-mm 
redness at vaccine site on study day 9 reported for a girl is consistent with a delayed skin reaction, but 
was also accompanied by sporadic papular lesions on hands, elbows and feet, indicative of a delayed 
hypersensitivity. The onset of study day 24 in the 9-year-old boy with a history of seasonal allergy and 
generalised rash all over body is rather late to finally establish vaccine relatedness. Urticaria are not 
currently listed as an adverse reaction separately, only hypersensitivity and rash are listed. The CHMP 
agreed to summarise different hypersensitivity reaction under the term of hypersensitivity. The term 
urticaria could also be covered under the broad term rash, which is listed separately. 
Post-marketing experience 
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have occurred post-marketing, mainly in male young 
adults and adolescents who received COVID-19 vaccines. EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) recommended 
listing myocarditis and pericarditis as new side effects in the product information for these vaccines, 
together with a warning to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and people taking these 
vaccines. The Committee concluded that the cases primarily occurred within 14 days after vaccination, 
more often after the second dose and in younger adult men. In five cases that occurred in the EEA, 
people died. They were either of advanced age or had concomitant diseases. Available data suggest that 
the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is similar to the typical course of these 
conditions, usually improving with rest or treatment. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data base and follow-up 
The safety data base comprises safety and reactogenicity data from subjects in the unblinded dose 
finding part 1 and the placebo-controlled part 2. In the dose finding part 1 subjects received either a dose 
of 100 µg of mRNA-1273 or a dose of 50 µg. On 29th October 2021, a competitor’s COVID-19 vaccine

became available for the age group 5 –below 12 years of age via EUA by the FDA. If a child became 
eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine outside of the study, it became eligible to unblind and, if having received 
placebo, also eligible to receive comparator vaccine or to cross-over to receive 2 doses of mRNA-1273. 
Unblinding and cross-over vaccinations for the 6 to <12-year-old age group in Part 2 started on 1 
November 2021, 9 days before the data cut-off date for the pre-specified IA, marking the ending of the 
blinded follow-up for this age group. Data collected after participant unblinding are not included in the 
blinded phase analyses. Only 80 /1000 placebo participants have left the trial to date to seek an 
alternative vaccine. The vast majority of placebo recipients have crossed over to mRNA-1273 and 
contribute to additional safety follow-up, albeit unblinded. 
The final selected dose for the paediatric population 6-<12 years of age is 50 µg. This dose could be 
justified by the reactogenicity and immunogenicity data submitted within this procedure. The data base 
however is insufficient to detect rare events like immune disorders or the confirmed AE of pericarditis. 
Due to these potential risks it is nonetheless desirable to have clinical data evaluating lower doses in this 
age group in the future. The MAH added a Part 3 to the protocol where one additional cohort of 
approximately 300 participants 6 to < 12 years of age will receive 2 doses of 25 μg of mRNA-1273 
followed by a pre-planned booster dose 6 months after the second dose, to assess the reactogenicity 
profile and immunogenicity of a lower dose in this age group. As stated in the response to the request for 
supplementary information, results from this part 3 are not expected to be available before the second 
half of 2022. 
A pooled analysis for all subjects who received the final selected dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273 has not been 
performed. 
The first data snapshot supporting the extension of indication to the paediatric population from 6-<12 
years of age is 6th October 2021. The safety sets include data from 4753 participant (data snapshot 6th 
October 2021), including 3758 participants who received at least 1 dose of either 50 µg or 100 μg mRNA-
1273 and from 995 participants who received at least 1 dose of placebo. Overall, 3387 participants had 
received at least one dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273, which is the final selected dose for the paediatric 
population 6-<12 years of age. Follow-up time is rather short. A safety follow-up of at least 28 days after 
dose 2 was performed for 853 participants who had received at least one dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. 
Safety follow-up for 3 months post-dose 2 was provided for 749 subjects who had received at least one 
dose of either 50 µg or 100 µg mRNA-1273 (in Part 1). The MAH was asked to submit safety data for a 
later time point. The MAH proposed to conduct another interim analysis (IA) based on a 10th November 
2021 data cut-off, meeting per protocol IA specification (all participants 6 to <12 years in Part 2 reach 
Day 57 or had discontinued the study). This 2nd IA with data cut-off 10th November 2021 was submitted 
subsequently, but still not all participants have reached day 56 post-dose 2. In the 10th November 2021 
IA safety analysis, a median follow-up of 56 days post-dose 2 is provided for a total of 3387 participants 
exposed to 50 µg mRNA-1273 across study Parts 1 and 2 from the blinded and open label phases. From 
Part 2, median follow-up of 55 days post-dose 2 is provided for 4002 participants (3007 exposed to 50 
µg, and 995 placebo). 
Taking blinded phase and open-label phase of part 2 together, there are 2984 (99.2 %) participants in 
the mRNA-1273 group and 967 (97.2 %) participants in the placebo group who have been followed for 28 
days or more after dose 2. 1498 (49.8%) participants in the mRNA-1273 group and 456 (45.8%) 
participants in the placebo group have been followed for 56 days or more after dose 2. 
Exposure to vaccine 
The dropout rate was low in both parts of the trial. In part 1 one subject (in the 50 µg dose group) 
discontinued study vaccination due to an adverse event of urticaria papular on Day 9 following dose 1. 
One subject in the 100 µg dose group withdraw from the study because of lost to follow-up. 3 subjects 
(0.4%), 1 in the 50 µg dose group and 2 in the 100 µg dose group withdraw consent. In part 2, 20 
subjects (0.5%) withdraw from the study, 9 participants (0.3%) in the mRNA-1273 group and 11 (1.1%) 
in the placebo group.

In Part 1, at the time of the 2nd IA, 380 participants in the 50 μg group and 371 participants in the 100 μg 
group received dose 1 and 379 participants in the 50 μg group and 371 participants in the 100 μg group 
received dose 2. As of 10th November 2021, no additional participants have been withdrawn due to TEAE 
in Part 1. 
In Part 2, a total of 4002 participants had received dose 1 (3007 in mRNA1273 group and 995 in placebo 
group) and a total of 3961 participants had received dose 2 (2988 in the mRNA-1273 group and 973 in 
placebo group. The proportion of subjects who discontinued through 10th November 2021 was comparable 
to the first interim analyses. 
The sample size in this trial is too low to detect rare events. 
Demography and baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two dose groups in Part 1 and 
between the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group in Part 2. Part 1 and Part 2 were also comparable with 
regards to Demographics and baseline characteristics. The majority of participants in both parts of the 
study were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline (86.4% in Part 1 and 89.2% in Part 2). The proportion 
of obese and non-obese children was comparable between the placebo and the vaccine group in part 2 of 
the trial. In the placebo group 19 children (1.9%) were obese and in the vaccine group 20.2% (607 
children). The proportion of obese/non-obese children overall in the 50 µg vaccine group (part 1 and part 
2 together) was 20.5% obese versus 79.5% non-obese and was comparable in the placebo and the 
vaccine group. At least one medical history was reported by 53.5% of subjects in the placebo and by 
55.8% of subjects in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group (taking part 1 and part 2 together). Less data 
with regards to risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcome are available for the paediatric population 
compared to the adult population. Limited data suggest an increased risk of severe or critical disease in 
children less than one year of age and those with certain underlying medical conditions like e.g. 
congenital heart disease, and chronic pulmonary disease. The trial enrolled only individuals who are in a 
good health. Children with stable chronic underlying disease were however allowed to be enrolled into the 
trial. At least one medical history was reported by 53.5% of subjects in the placebo and by 55.8% of 
subjects in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group (taking part 1 and part 2 together). 
Local and systemic reactogenicity 
The incidence of solicited local and more notable of systemic ARs was lower in the 50 µg dose group 
compared with the 100 µg dose group in Part 1. This well justifies the selection of the 50 µg dose for the 
paediatric population 6-<12 years of age. A lower dose of mRNA-1273 (25 µg) has not been tested in this 
population. In Part 2, solicited local and systemic ARs occurred in a higher incidence in the mRNA-1273 
group compared with the placebo group, as it can be expected. The incidence of solicited local and more 
notable of solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-1273 group was, as previously observed in Part 1 and in 
other mRNA-1273 clinical trials higher post-dose 2 compared with post-dose 1. In part 2, the most often 
reported solicited local AR in the mRNA-1273 group after any dose was pain reported by 98.4% of 
subjects in the mRNA-1273 versus 64.1% in the placebo group. The majority of solicited local ARs was 
reported as mild to moderate in both groups. Again, the incidence of severe ARs was higher in the mRNA-
1273 compared with the placebo group. The most frequently reported grade 3 local solicited AR after any 
dose in the mRNA-1273 group was pain, reported by 3.3% of subjects. Grade 3 erythema was reported 
by 1.6%, and grade 3 injection site swelling by 1.3% of subjects. Grade 3 axillary (or groin) swelling or 
tenderness was reported for only 0.2% of subjects. No grade 4 solicited local ARs was reported in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group. The majority of the solicited local ARs in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 
occurred within Day 1 (94.8%) to day 2 (3.6%) after any dose and persisted for a median of 3 days. Any 
solicited local AR persisting beyond 7 days after any injection was reported by 4.6% of subjects in the 
vaccine and by 2.4% of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported solicited local AR 
persisting beyond 7 days after any injection in the mRNA-1273 group was axillary (or groin) swelling or 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 95/121 
 
 
 
 
  
tenderness reported by 2.2% of subjects. Late onset solicited local ARs starting after day 7 in the mRNA-
1273 group were reported by 2.7% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group post-dose 1, but only by 
< 0.1% of participants post-dose 2. Late onset ARs reported after any dose were injection site swelling 
(0.7%) participants, injection site pain (0.5%), erythema (2.1%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or 
tenderness (< 0.1%). Very minor changes in the incidence of solicited local and systemic ARs in part 1 
and part 2 were noted. The minor changes are due to data clearance and additional subjects with follow-
up on solicited ARs post-dose 2. The changes do not alter the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax. 
Solicited ARs from 6-<12-year-old participants in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 group of Study P204 were 
compared with solicited ARs reported from 18- to 25-year-old participants in the mRNA-1273 group (100 
μg) in Part A of Study P301, a population for whom efficacy has been demonstrated. Local reactogenicity 
appeared to be higher in the younger age cohort 6 to <12 years of age compared with the older age 
cohort 18-25 years of age. Of note, the majority of local ARs was mild to moderate in both age cohorts 
and the incidence of severe local solicited ARs was lower in the P204 population of 6-<12 years of age 
compared to the older age cohort. Grade 3 solicited local ARs were reported by 5.5% of subjects 6-<12 
years of age and by 11.4% of subjects 18-25 years of age. In contrast to local reactogenicity, the 
systemic reactogenicity tended to be lower in the younger age cohort. Fever was the only systemic 
solicited AR with a higher incidence in subjects 6-<12 years of age. Any fever after any dose was 
reported by 25.6% of subjects in P204 and by 18.1% in P301). Except for fever, solicited grade 3 
systemic ARs were overall less frequent reported by participants 6-<12 years of age in Study P204 
(13.1%) compared with Study P301 participants 18-25 years of age (23.5%). The incidence of unsolicited 
AEs up to 28 days after vaccination, including medically attended AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation 
from the second dose or the trial, and serious AEs were comparable. In summary, no meaningful 
difference could be detected with regard to the reactogenicity in the younger paediatric population 6 -<12 
years of age and young adults 18 to 25 years of age. 
Use of pain medication 
In Part 1, the use of pain and/or fever medication for prevention and for treatment was notably higher in 
the 100 µg dose group compared with the 50 µg dose group. In part 2, as it can be expected, the use of 
pain/fever medication for treatment was notably higher in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with 
the placebo group (approximately 2.7 fold higher post-dose 1 and approximately 5.7 fold higher post-
dose 2). The proportion of participants with prophylactic use was comparable in the two groups post-dose 
1 (2.1% in the placebo, and 2.7% in the vaccine group), but approximately 2 fold higher in the vaccine 
group (5.3%) compared with the placebo group (2.4%) post-dose 2. This appears to be plausible because 
of the blinded design and the higher reactogenicity in the mRNA-1273 group post-dose 1. The use of 
pain/fever medication for treatment in the placebo group was comparable post-dose 1 (8.7%) and post-
dose 2 (8.1%), whereas it was in the vaccine group notably higher post-dose 2 (46.2%) compared with 
post-dose 1 (23.1%), which is explained by the higher reactogenicity of the vaccine post-dose 2. 
The proportion of subjects using pain medication to prevent or to treat pain and fever in the placebo and 
the mRNA-1273 vaccine group was only minimal different in the 2nd IA. 
Unsolicited AEs 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality was slightly higher in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 
vaccine group compared with the 100 µg dose group. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality up to 28 
days after any dose were reported by 30.5% of subjects in the 50 µg and by 25.9% in the 100 µg dose 
group. Then incidence of medically attended adverse events (MAAEs) was comparable in the 2 dose 
groups (11.8% versus 12.7% of subjects in the 50 µg and the 100 µg group, respectively). 
In part 2, the incidence of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality was slightly higher in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group compared with the placebo group. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality were reported 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 96/121 
 
 
 
 
  
by 23.8% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 group and by 19.5% in the placebo group up to 28 days post-
vaccination. The majority of AEs is due to the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions. 
The most frequently unsolicited AEs in the mRNA-1273 group included the PTs injection site erythema 
(2.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.3%), headache (2.3%), oropharyngeal pain (2.0%), cough 
(1.8%), rhinorrhoea (1.7%), nasal congestion (1.6%), injection site lymphadenopathy (1.4%), injection 
site pain (1.2%), and fatigue (1.1%). In the placebo group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs 
were oropharyngeal pain (2.2%), nasal congestion (2.2%), COVID-19 (2.1%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (1.9%), headache (1.8%), rhinorrhoea (1.8%), cough (2.1%), and fatigue (1.2%). The 
comparison shows that unsolicited AEs experienced in the mRNA-1273 group do not notably differ in 
nature and incidence as those in the placebo group with the exception of an increase in the incidence of 
injection site conditions in the mRNA-1273 group. Medically-attended AEs were reported in 8.5% of 
participants in the mRNA-1273 group and by 10.1% in the placebo group 
Unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related 
The vast majority of reported unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related belong to injection site 
conditions and are already covered in the SmPC. After assessment of the available clinical information, No 
AE considered being vaccine related in part 1 is considered for inclusion into section 4.8 of the SmPC. The 
nature of unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related that were provided by the MAH for part 2 does 
not change the safety profile of the vaccine as it has been determined for the adult population and the 
paediatric population 12 to <18 years of age or negatively affects the overall positive benefit-risk ratio. 
An imbalance was observed for the event of abdominal pain in part 2 (5 subjects [0.2%] in the mRNA-
1273 vaccine group and no subject in the placebo group). Together with one AE of “abdominal pain 
upper” in the vaccine group, the proportion would be 6 versus 0 subjects. Similarly, there was also a 
trend for a slight imbalance for all unsolicited AEs (regardless of relatedness) of the PTs abdominal pain 
(0.6% versus 0.4%), abdominal pain upper (0.3% versus 0.1%), and abdominal pain lower (1 subject 
versus 0 subject). In young children, abdominal pain is generally frequent and the abdominal region is an 
organ onto which discomfort from other causes is often projected. Probably, the cases of abdominal pain 
in the vaccine group reflect the relatively high reactogenicity of the vaccine. It is acknowledged, that the 
majority of abdominal pain events was considered being not related by the investigator. However, the 
numerical imbalance, albeit small, remains. The 3:1 ratio is taken into account when considering the 
proportion of subjects reporting abdominal pain (0.2% versus 0%). Therefore, the event of abdominal 
pain should be included into the SmPC with the corresponding frequency and a footnote, explaining that 
this AE is only observed in the paediatric population 6-<12 years of age. 
The incidence of unsolicited adverse events is comparable for males and females, both with regard to 
those AEs considered related to IP and to AEs irrespective of relationship. 
Similarly, for seropositive vs. seronegative trial participants, the incidences of unsolicited AEs are overall 
comparable, with the caveat that the size of the seropositive group was fairly small. 
Only minimal changes in the incidence of unsolicited AES are observed for the 2nd IA. The nature of 
unsolicited AEs was identical. The minor changes with regard to the incidence do not alter the benefit-risk 
profile of Spikevax. 
Serious adverse events 
As of data snapshot overall 8 SAEs were reported in part 1 and part 2 together. All SAEs occurred either 
in the 50 µg or the 100 µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group, none in the placebo group. None of the SAEs was 
considered being vaccine related by the investigator, which could be agreed upon. No events indicative of 
autoimmune disease, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, or immune thrombocytopenia 
were observed. Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In 
addition, the careful enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. 
Of note, the sample size is not sufficiently large to detect rare or very rare AEs. 
One 8-year-old male participant in the 50 µg dose group in Part 2 was discontinued from the trial 20 days 
post-dose 2 because of an event of inflammatory bowel disease (the event was moderate and did not 
fulfil SAE criteria). 20 days post-dose 1, he experienced a moderate treatment-emergent adverse event 
of inflammatory bowel disease. The boy had a past medical history of seizure disorder, headaches and 
occasional abdominal pain. According to the mother, he had occasional abdominal pain for many years, 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 97/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
but has never been worked up for diagnosis until that date. 63 days post-dose 1 additional information 
was received from the investigator’s site noting that an endoscopy failed to indicate IBD, but did identify 
granulomas. Additional immunology and genetics testing revealed that the child had no immune response 
to previous routine vaccinations. The new possible diagnosis is Common Variable Immunodeficiency 
(CVID). 
The number of subjects reporting PTs in the broad scope SMQ Angioedema were 3 (0.3%) in the placebo 
group and 16 (0.5%) in the vaccine group in Part 2, versus 5 (1.3%) subjects in the 50 µg group and 2 
(0.5%) in the 100 µg group of Part 1, driven by the PT of urticaria. These rates are higher than those 
observed in children 12-<18, who reported such events at a rate of 0.3% in both the placebo and the 
vaccine arm. In conclusion, the incidence of adverse events associated with hypersensitivity appears to 
be slightly higher in the younger children, but are mainly driven by cutaneous reactions and seasonal 
allergies. 
In both parts, no vaccine related SAEs or AESIs were reported in the 2nd IA. 
Evaluation of myo-and pericarditis 
To perform an enhanced surveillance on the events of myocarditis and pericarditis the CTP has been 
updated. Two overlapping approaches were used to interrogate all TEAEs. This included: 
1.  narrow and broad cardiomyopathy standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries 
(MedDRA SMQs) 
2.  an algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in the CDC 
working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis (Gargano et al. 2021) 
Sites were instructed to ask the caregiver the following question: “Has your child experienced any of the 
following symptoms since we last spoke? Chest pain, pressure or discomfort; Shortness of breath, fast 
breathing at rest, or any pain with breathing; Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.” 
Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful 
enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. In summary, the 
submitted clinical data do not reveal any case of myo-or pericarditis up to the data snapshot. The sample 
size however is too small to finally assess the safety signal of myo-and pericarditis. The evaluation of 
cardiomyopathy SMQ and additional analysis of myocarditis and pericarditis performed within the 2nd 
analysis did not reveal a case of myo-or pericarditis in part 1 and part 2. It must be stated, that the 
sample size of the trial in general is still too low to detect this rare event. Myocarditis and pericarditis is a 
confirmed signal which cannot be excluded for this age group. Myocarditis and pericarditis is reflected in 
the SmPC and concerns all individuals of the indicated target population irrespective of age. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
This type II variation aims to include children aged 6 to <12 years of age to the label of Spikevax. The 
database for evaluation of the safety profile of mRNA-1273 in the paediatric population 6 to <12 years of 
age derives from study P204. This is an ongoing Phase 2/3, 2-part, open-label, dose-escalation, age de-
escalation and subsequent randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in healthy children 6 months to 
less than 12 years of age. The study population includes 3 age groups (6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to 
< 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years). This submission focus as mentioned above on children 6 years to 
< 12 years of age. The open-label dose selection Part 1 is evaluating up to 3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 
μg) of mRNA-1273 in each age group. It should be noted, that the 25 µg dose was not tested in the age 
group 6 to < 12 years of age. The selection of the 50 µg dose of mRNA-1273 is justified by the lower 
local and systemic reactogenicity compared to 100 µg mRNA-1273. But still, also the 50 µg dose is 
reactogenic. This is reflected not only in the incidence of solicited ARs but also in the use of pain/fever 
medication.  
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 98/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The comparison of reactogenicity between 6 to < 12-year-old participants in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 group 
of Study P204 with 18- to 25-year-old participants in the mRNA-1273 group (100 μg) in Part A of Study 
P301, a population for whom efficacy was demonstrated, showed a slightly higher local reactogenicity, 
with a lower incidence of grade 3 local ARs. Systemic reactogenicity tended not to be higher in the 
younger population except for fever that was reported with a clearly higher incidence in the younger 
population. Unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality experienced in the mRNA-1273 group do not notably 
differ in nature and incidence as those in the placebo group with the exception of an increase in the 
incidence of injection site conditions in the mRNA-1273 group. The comparison indicates, that the 
reactogenicity in the population 6-<12 years of age is not clinically meaningful higher compared to young 
adults, when a lower dose is given, but with a different pattern of solicited AEs, e.g. more events of fever, 
and a slightly higher incidence of adverse events associated with hypersensitivity. 
Literature indicates an increased risk of severe or critical COVID-19 disease in children less than one year 
of age and those with certain underlying medical conditions like e.g. congenital heart disease, and chronic 
pulmonary disease. The trial enrolled only individuals who are in a good health. Children with stable 
chronic underlying disease were allowed to be enrolled into the trial, but no conclusion on the safety 
profile in individuals with severe comorbidities or who are immunocompromised can be drawn. 
Another imbalance was seen in the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders (vaccine: 2.2% vs. placebo 1.6%). 
For the AE of abdominal pain, there was an imbalance for events considered related to vaccination and 
regardless of relationship. The 3:1 ratio in the 2 groups is hereby is taken into account. Therefore, an 
amendment with regard to section 4.8 is considered necessary. The event of abdominal pain should be 
included into the SmPC with the corresponding frequency and a footnote, explaining that this AE is only 
observed in the paediatric population 6 to 11 years of age. No events indicative of autoimmune disease, 
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, or immune thrombocytopenia were observed. Neither in 
Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful enhanced 
analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. Of note, the sample size is not 
sufficiently large to detect rare or very rare AEs. 
In summary: 
Reactogenicity was in principle comparable to that seen in older children or young adults, but with a 
different pattern of solicited AEs, e.g. more events of fever but less events of myalgia, arthralgia or chills. 
With regard to unsolicited AEs, a difference in incidence (between vaccine and placebo) was noted, which 
was primarily driven by events in the SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions, mainly 
consisting of injection site reactions that persisted beyond 7 days after injection (e.g., erythema, 
lymphadenopathy, rash, induration or swelling at the injection site). Further, a higher incidence of 
hypersensitivity and cutaneous events was observed, not only vs. placebo but also compared to older 
children. 
The data collected in the 2nd IA with data cut-off 10th November 2021 do not alter the benefit-risk profile 
of Spikevax when given to individuals 5 to below 12 years of age. 
As this part of Study P204 is not a stand-alone MAA, but bridges to the already authorised populations, 
including children 12 to <18 years of age, the safety profile observed in these older age cohorts can be 
extrapolated to this younger age group.  
This dose of 50 µg could be justified by the reactogenicity and immunogenicity data submitted within this 
procedure. The data base however is insufficient to detect rare events like immune disorders or the 
confirmed AE of pericarditis. Due to these potential risks it is nonetheless desirable to have clinical data 
evaluating lower doses in this age group in the future. Such analysis is planned to be conducted by the 
MAH. Results will not be available before the second half of 2022.

Enhanced 
pharmacovigilance study 
to provide additional 
evaluation of AESI 
(including myocarditis and 
pericarditis) and emerging 
validated safety signals. 
The study has 3 core 
objectives: 
-Estimation of background 
rates for AESI and other 
outcomes in the cohort  
-Assessment of observed 
versus expected rates  
-Self-controlled risk 
interval analyses for 
adverse events that meet 
specific threshold criteria  
The overarching research 
question of this study: Is 
the occurrence of each 
adverse event of special 
interest (AESI) among 
persons vaccinated with 
Spikevax in Europe higher 
than the occurrence of that 
AESI that would have been 
expected in the same 
population in the absence 
of Spikevax? 
Primary objective: 
- To assess whether 
vaccination with Spikevax 
(by dose number where 
feasible and for any dose) 
is associated with 
increased rates of the AESI 
compared with the 
expected rates overall and 
stratified by country, sex, 
and age group. 
Secondary objective: 
- To assess whether 
vaccination with Spikevax 
is associated with

No changes to the Risk minimisation measures are proposed within the updated RMP. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to merge editorially the version submitted in this procedure 
with the latest approved RMP version. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). COVID-19 is primarily recognised as febrile respiratory illness. While the majority of cases 
subsides without specific treatment in a subgroup of patients the disease progresses to severe disease 
characterised by oxygen requirement. Still fewer patients progress to critical disease with respiratory 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 112/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
failure, ARDS, multiorgan failure and/or thromboembolic complications. Age is the major risk factor for 
severe COVID-19 and death, other described risk factors are obesity, pre-existent diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, lung disease, immuno-deficiency and pregnancy. COVID-19 can be considered 
confirmed by the existence of above clinical signs and proof of the presence of the virus e.g. by NAAT. 
In children above 6 years of age, SARS-CoV-2 infections cause mostly asymptomatic or mild disease. 
Therefore, any conclusions on the incidence of COVID-19 i.e. symptomatic infection in children have 
considerable uncertainty. However, severe COVID-19 cases including cases of death do occur but are 
mostly described in children with underlying diseases such as congenital cardiovascular disease, 
pulmonary disease, malignancy and hereditary syndromes. Currently there is an incomplete 
understanding of the burden of severe COVID-19 in the paediatric population and knowledge is evolving. 
A complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children which is distinct from COVID-19 and likely not related 
to underlying disease is the so-called “paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIM-S, also 
referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C) which has some resemblance to 
the Kawasaki Syndrome. PIM-S is characterised by generalised inflammatory state also involving internal 
organs including the heart and kidney leading to shock and organ failure. The exact incidence is currently 
unknown. Even though intensive care treatment is necessary in a substantial fraction of patients most 
patients survive the acute phase with appropriate treatment. The long-term sequelae are currently 
unknown. 
The information of post-COVID-19 syndrome (“long COVID”) in children is currently sparse. 
The MAH is seeking an extension of the indication for Spikevax to children ≥6-<12 years. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience gained over time, there 
remains an urgent and unmet need for a vaccine able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 during the 
ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of particularly vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the 
pandemic on a population level are desired. Although one vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 in children 
aged 5 years or older is available, there is still a need for additional vaccines to meet demand. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This submission is based on one clinical trial conducted in children. Study P204 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, 
2-part, open-label, dose escalation, age de-escalation and subsequent randomized (3:1), observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled expansion study that evaluates the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy 
of Spikevax in children aged ≥ 6 months to < 12 years. With this submission interim data on the ≥ 6 to 
<12 years age group were provided. 
Vaccine efficacy is inferred based on demonstrating non-inferiority of the geometric mean value of serum 
Ab and the seroresponse rate from children aged ≥ 6 to <12 years compared with those obtained from 
young adults (≥ 18 to ≤ 25 years of age) enrolled in the ongoing adult study (Study P301). Additionally, 
secondary study endpoints assessed the effect of Spikevax on COVID-19 and asymptomatic infection. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies it has been demonstrated that neutralising antibodies play a crucial 
role in preventing COVID-19. Spikevax was shown to elicit non-inferior neutralising antibody levels and 
seroresponse rates in children ≥6 to <12 years of age without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection compared 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 113/121 
 
 
 
 
  
to young adults ≥18 to <25 years. Based on these immunobridging results (GMT, GMR and seroresponse 
rates) efficacy can be inferred for children.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the difference seen in nAb responses in the dose selection and expanded immunogenicity set in 
part 1 of the study the true difference in antibody responses between children and young adults remains 
uncertain. The observed large discrepancy in nAb GMTs (PsVNA ID50) between ‘dose-selection’ and 
‘pivotal’ cohorts casts doubt on the comparability of assay readouts between different cohorts used for 
dose selection and immunogenicity analysis for immunobridging and assay variability does not explain 
these effects alone. Further potential sources for the observed differences in nAb GMT, which likely 
contribute to this observation are the small sample size and lack of random selection of the serum 
samples.  
The study plans remain rather vague and together with the observed deviations are not up to the usual 
standard of a confirmatory trial (e.g. the timing and sample size of key analyses, the definition of analysis 
sets used for the confirmation of immune bridging concerning the combination/separation of parts and 
age groups as well as the lack of pre-specification of the immunogenicity subset). It cannot be fully 
excluded that decision were made in the light of the accrued data from the open-label Part 1.  
Upon request, further immunogenicity data on a larger cohort from the blinded part 2 of the study were 
provided by the MAH. These data support the immunogenicity results initially provided and the 
immunobridging results although the root cause for the divergent results could not conclusively be 
determined. 
No data are available from children with a risk of more severe disease. Unless there is clear 
immunocompromise associated with the underlying disease it is expected that the vaccine protects these 
individuals to a similar degree. 
No information is available in patients with immune suppressive therapy. A study in immunocompromised 
children is included in the PIP.  
It is currently unknown how long protection will last in children and adults and, if vaccination provides 
protection against newly emerging variants. However, it is expected that the duration of protection from 
symptomatic disease follows the trajectory observed in adults. As the results of the requested analyses 
on a larger subset of children randomised in study part 2 (n=319) indicate a lower GM than initially 
observed it is not possible to predict whether a longer duration of protection is likely. 
The impact on transmission is currently unknown. 
No (immune) correlate of protection has been identified to date. 
Due to the short median follow-up period of 51 days post-dose 2 and the very low number of COVID-19 
cases observed no reliable vaccine efficacy data are available for the time being.  
As the study is ongoing results were not provided for all endpoints. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Spikevax is reactogenic. The incidence of solicited local ARs (pain, axillary swelling, erythema, injection 
site swelling) in the Spikevax group was, as previously observed in other Spikevax clinical trials, higher 
post-dose 2 compared with post-dose 1. Almost all of participants in the 50 µg mRNA-1273 group of the 
blinded part 2 reported solicited local ARs (98.6% of subjects in the mRNA-1273 group versus 65.2% in 
the placebo group). The incidence of severe ARs was higher in the mRNA-1273 compared with the 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 114/121 
 
 
 
 
  
placebo group. The most frequently reported grade 3 local solicited AR after any dose in the mRNA-1273 
group was pain, reported by 3.3% of subjects. Grade 3 erythema was reported by 1.6%, and grade 3 
injection site swelling by 1.3% of subjects. Grade 3 axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness was 
reported for only 0.2% of subjects. No grade 4 solicited local ARs was reported in the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group.  
The most frequently reported solicited local AR persisting beyond 7 days after any injection in the mRNA-
1273 group was axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness reported by 2.2% of subjects, followed by 
injection site pain and injection site erythema reported by 1.4% of subjects each in the vaccine group. 
Persisting injection site swelling was reported by 0.9% of subjects in the vaccine group. Late onset 
solicited local ARs starting after day 7 in the mRNA-1273 group occurred and were reported by 2.7% of 
subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group post-dose 1, but only by < 0.1% of participants post-dose 2. 
The late onset ARs reported after any dose were injection site swelling (0.7%) participants, injection site 
pain (0.5%), erythema (2.1%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (< 0.1%) of participants. 
Also, the incidence of solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-1273 group was notably higher post-dose 2 
compared with post-dose 1, which is in line with previous Spikevax trials. The most often reported 
solicited systemic AR in the mRNA-1273 group after any dose was fatigue reported by 73.0% of subjects 
in the mRNA-1273 versus 47.2% in the placebo group. This was followed by headache (62.0% versus 
43.7%), myalgia (35.2% versus 17.3%), chills (34.6% versus 11.8), nausea (29.2% versus 17.8%), 
fever (25.9% versus 3.6%), and arthralgia (21.2% versus 13.4%). The most frequently reported grade 3 
systemic solicited AR after any dose in the mRNA-1273 group was fatigue, reported by 7.1% of subjects. 
Grade 3 headache was reported by 4.4%, and grade 3 fever by 4.2%. Grade 3 myalgia was reported by 
2.7% of subjects. All other solicited systemic ARs were reported by not more than 0.9% of subjects in the 
mRNA-1273 group after any dose. The use of pain/fever medication for treatment was notably higher in 
the mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the placebo group (approximately 2.7 fold higher post-dose 
1 and approximately 5.7 fold higher post-dose 2). The use of pain/fever medication for treatment in the 
placebo group was comparable post-dose 1 (8.7%) and post-dose 2 (8.1%), whereas it was in the 
vaccine group notably higher post-dose 2 (46.2%) compared with post-dose 1 (23.1%), which is 
explained by the higher reactogenicity of the vaccine post-dose2. 
Only very minor changes with regard to solicited systemic and local AR incidence were noted in the 
second interim analysis compared to the first. Upon request, the MAH confirmed that the root cause for 
these changes is that additional subjects having completed ≥ 7 days since second injection. Moreover, 
with the ongoing nature of the study additional queries were closed, and further activities regarding data 
cleaning were conducted, which may contribute. The minor changes in the incidence of solicited ARs do 
not impact the benefit-risk balance of Spikevax. The effects table (Table 42) has been updated 
accordingly. 
Comparison of reactogenicity to participants Aged ≥ 12 to < 18 Years (n=2,485, Study P301): The AR of 
fever (25.9% vs. 13.7%, grade 3: 4.2% vs. 2.2%) was the only event which was clearly more common 
(after any injection) in younger children (6 to <12 years), compared to adolescents (≥12 to <18 years). 
In contrast, lower incidences were reported for the ARs of headache (62% vs. 78.4%), myalgia (35.2% 
vs. 54.3%), arthralgia (21.1% vs. 34.6%), chills (34.6% vs. 49.1%), swelling (22.5% vs. 27.7%), and 
axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (26.9 % vs. 34.6%). The reporting rates were comparable for 
the following events: fatigue (73% vs. 75.2%), nausea/vomiting (29.2% vs. 29.3%), pain (98.4% vs. 
97.2%), erythema (24.3% vs. 25.8%). The data for adolescents were extracted from the EPAR.  
Comparison of reactogenicity to participants Aged ≥ 18 to 25 Years (n=878, Study P301): Participants 
between 6-11 years had higher reporting rates for the local ARs of pain (98.2% vs. 93.5%), erythema 
(24.5% vs. 9.5%), swelling (22.8% vs. 14.0%), and the systemic AR of fever (25.6% vs. 18.1%, grade 
3: 4.1% vs. 1.1%). In contrast, lower incidences were noted for the systemic ARs of headache (61.8% 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 115/121 
 
 
 
 
  
vs. 73.8%), myalgia (34.5% vs. 63.2%), arthralgia (20.6% vs. 44.6%), nausea/vomiting (28.9% vs. 
33.0%) and chills (33.6% vs. 53.6%). The incidences of fatigue (72.6% vs. 73.0%) and axillary (or 
groin) swelling or tenderness (26% vs. 27.9%) were very similar. 
The number of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs up to 28 Days after any vaccination was higher in the 
mRNA-1273 group (23.8%), compared to placebo (19.5%). This difference was primarily driven by 
events in the SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions (vaccine: 9.0%; placebo: 
3.5%), mainly consisting of injection site reactions that persisted beyond 7 days after injection (e.g., 
erythema, lymphadenopathy, rash, induration or swelling at the injection site).  
The subject incidence of unsolicited treatment-related AEs was also higher in the mRNA-1273 group 
(9.8%; placebo: 3.7%). The difference was again mainly caused by injection site reactions persisting 
beyond day 7 after vaccination (vaccine: 7.5% vs. placebo: 2.2%). The injection site reactions are 
already adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Study Part 1 (dose finding): The decision to go for the lower dose is supported due to the overall milder 
profile of ARs, also regarding the incidence of severe ARs (see discussion of Part 1 for detailed data). 
However, even with the lower dose, the reactogenicity caused by the vaccine was still very pronounced. 
Investigating the additional (optional) 25 µg dose in study P204 would have been desirable from a safety 
perspective. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Spikevax has been administered to a large number of adults and adolescents and the safety profile is to a 
large extent described by the data from the controlled trials. No meaningful difference could be detected 
with regard to the reactogenicity of the lower dose in the younger paediatric population 6 to <12 years of 
age and young adults 18 to 25 years of age.  
Not unexpectedly, rare ADRs have occurred in the post-authorisation phase. The rare ADR of myocarditis 
and pericarditis have been described mostly in young men. The cause of myo/pericarditis remains 
unknown at the present point in time. The age pattern for myo/pericarditis following vaccination indicates 
a specific vulnerability in young males. The data on myo/pericarditis in adolescents are currently still 
inconclusive so it is unknown whether the vulnerable age extends to children. However, myocarditis in 
children is an extremely rare event and the peak observed in young adults (and potentially adolescents) 
may indicate a specific vulnerable phase in life for this specific condition. Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a 
case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful enhanced analysis of relevant PTs 
does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. Of note, the sample size is not sufficiently large to 
detect rare or very rare AEs. 
No events indicative of autoimmune disease were observed. 
The trial enrolled only individuals who were in good health. Children with stable chronic underlying 
disease were allowed to be enrolled into the trial, but no conclusion on the safety profile in individuals 
with severe comorbidities or who are immunocompromised can be drawn. It is not expected that a worse 
safety profile will be observed in patients with underlying disease that predisposes to severe COVID-19. 
The safety database submitted within the initial submission was limited as regards follow-up time of the 
majority of children following the second dose, especially in Part 2 of the study. A meaningful short term 
follow-up (4 weeks post-dose 2) was only available for a minority of subjects, i.e. 18.8%, n=474 in this 
part of the trial. Therefore, the MAH was asked to provide a further safety analyses when all participants 
6 to <12 years in Part 2 reach Day 57 or had discontinued the study. Upon request the MAH requested 
safety data for a pre-specified second interim analysis with data cut-off 10th November 2021. It should be 
noted, that due to EUA of a COVID-19 vaccine for this age group, unblinding and cross-over vaccinations 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 116/121 
 
 
 
 
  
in part 2 of the trial started 1 November 2021, i.e. 9 days before the data cut-off date for the pre-
specified second analysis. Almost all subjects had their 28 day follow-up post-dose 2 in part 1 and part 2. 
Less participants in part 2 have had their follow-up of 56 days post-dose 2. 1,066 (35.5%) participants in 
the mRNA-1273 group and 218 (21.9%) participants in the placebo group have been followed for 56 days 
or more after dose 2. The safety data collected in the second analysis do not alter the benefit-risk profile 
of Spikevax when given to individuals 6-<12 years of age.

vaccine related. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effect of vaccination is the prevention of symptomatic, severe disease that 
has been demonstrated for Spikevax in the pivotal trials that were submitted for marketing authorisation 
as well as in subsequent effectiveness studies. A similar degree of the benefit of Spikevax in children 
aged ≥6 to <12 years can be inferred by successful immunobridging. This relates to the degree of 
protection, the duration of protection as well as the protection from disease caused by variants of concern 
where cross-neutralisation is expected (such as the Delta variant). A non-inferior immune response with 
respect to neutralising antibody levels and seroresponse rates is suggested by the presented data 
although discrepant results between the dose finding and confirmatory cohorts were observed. The root 
cause of the discrepant results was not conclusively identified. However, further data from a larger 
EMA/137337/2022 
Page 118/121 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number of subjects randomised in the blinded part of the study were presented that support the 
immunobridging approach.  
Whether vaccination can prevent PIM-S is currently unknown as the pathogenesis is not understood. 
The safety database overall could be sufficient. The known unfavourable effects are acceptable - even 
though Spikevax is reactogenic, the ADRs are only of short-term duration. The safety profile is 
comparable to what has been observed in adolescents and adults and no new ADR were observed. No 
cases of myocarditis were observed. As outlined above, myocarditis may be a phenomenon restricted to a 
certain age range only and therefore no reliable predictions can be made. Current data indicated that the 
cases of myocarditis are of short duration without sequelae. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Even though the course of COVID-19 in children is generally milder than in the older population, there are 
individuals that suffer from direct consequences of the infection. The average reactogenicity profile 
balances well vs. average natural course; rare (more severe) AEs should be outweighed by assuming 
protection against the reasonably more frequent hospital and ICU admissions and severe complications to 
an important degree. The benefits of preventing COVID-19 with potential irreversible and long-lasting 
consequences could outweigh the identified risks of vaccination, especially in children at risk of severe 
COVID-19.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Spikevax is currently authorised as a conditional marketing authorisation. 
The new paediatric indication is also intended to prevent COVID-19, in response to a public health threat 
duly recognised by the World Health Organisation and EU. 
The CHMP considers that this new indication also fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed.  
The identified uncertainties can be addressed post-marketing in the context of the existing conditional 
marketing authorisation, including the continuation of the pivotal study as long as possible, post-
approval effectiveness studies and routine disease surveillance. 
It is likely that the MAH will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The MAH will continue the ongoing paediatric study mRNA-1273-P204 in order to confirm the efficacy 
and safety of Spikevax in this paediatric population. The MAH is therefore requested to submit the 
final Clinical Study Report for the randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study mRNA-1273-
P204, to confirm the efficacy of Spikevax, designated a specific obligation (SOB).  
•  Based on the presented data for this new indication, the benefits to public health of the immediate 
availability is considered to outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still 
required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Spikevax is positive for use in individuals aged 6 to 11 years of age.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include use in children 6-11 years of age for Spikevax, based on data from 
study mRNA-1273-P204, an ongoing Phase 2/3, 2-part, open-label, dose-escalation, age de-escalation 
and subsequent randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in healthy children; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. Annex II and the Package Leaflet are 
updated in accordance. 
The CHMP adopted an updated RMP version 3.0. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex I, II and IIIB are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0481/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for umeclidinium bromide, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
•  1  serious  ADR    of  “ocular  hypertension”  with  positive  de-challenge  and  2  non-serious  
“intraocular  pressure  increased”  have  been  reported  cumulatively  with  Umeclidinium  bromide 
therapy;  
• 
• 
“Ocular  hypertension”  or  “intraocular  pressure  increased”  are  known  class  effect  of 
antimuscarinic  that could lead to glaucoma; 
The  Product  information  of  Umeclidinium  bromide/Vilanterol  has  been  recently  updated  to 
include  the undesirable effect “intraocular pressure increased”;  
Based  on  the  above,  the  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  Umeclidinium  bromide 
should be updated to reflect the undesirable effects “intraocular pressure increased” under the SOC 
“eye disorders” with frequency “not known”. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considers that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing umeclidinium bromide are warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium bromide the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing umeclidinium bromide is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

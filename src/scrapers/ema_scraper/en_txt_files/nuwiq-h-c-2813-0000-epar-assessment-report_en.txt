2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1085/2003, the Applicant submitted on 27 April 
2017 an extension application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the existing Marketing 
Authorisation for Nuwiq. 
With this extension application the Applicant is seeking approval for the new strengths 2500 IU, 3000 
IU and 4000 IU to the existing strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU- Marketing authorisation 
numbers: EU/1/14/936/001-004). 
The extension application is based on quality data and on nonclinical local tolerance data. 
About the product 
Nuwiq 250 IU/500 IU/1000 IU/2000 IU was approved in Europe via Centralised Procedure on 22 July 
2014. The active substance of Nuwiq is simoctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII). Nuwiq is 
produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F 
cells. 
Nuwiq is a white sterile lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. The lyophilised powder 
is supplied in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU (2500 IU, 3000 IU or 4000 
IU) of recombinant factor VIII per vial. Before use, the lyophilised powder is reconstituted with a 
single-dose solvent pre-filled syringe containing 2.5 mL of sterilised water for injections. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/114079/2018  
Page 5/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reconstituted solution is a clear, colourless solution, practically free from visible particles, containing 
100 IU / 200 IU / 400 IU / 800 IU (1000 IU / 1200 IU / 1600 IU) FVIII:C/mL. 
Nuwiq is indicated for: “Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency).  Nuwiq can be used for all age groups.” 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is an application for a change of an existing marketing authorisation leading to an extension as 
referred to in ANNEX 1 of Regulation (EC) No. 1234, 2008 - Addition of a new strength. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Nuwiq is supplied as a lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. The lyophilised powder 
is currently available in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU of recombinant 
factor VIII and is reconstituted with a single-dose solvent pre-filled syringe containing 2,5mL of sterile 
water for injections (WfI). With this line extension application the MAH is introducing single-dose vials 
containing the following new strengths: 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU which are also reconstituted 
with a single-dose solvent pre-filled syringe containing 2.5mL of sterile water for injections. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance of Nuwiq is simoctocog alfa, a B-domain deleted human coagulation factor VIII 
produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F 
cells (human cell line rhFVIII). 
The cell line has been adapted to grow in a defined medium free from animal derived compounds. The 
harvested product is concentrated and purified by a series of chromatography steps, which also include 
solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment for virus inactivation/removal. Moreover, the reduced molecular 
size of the B-domain deleted rFVIII molecule allowed the introduction of nanofiltration as a second 
virus reduction step within the active substance purification process. No animal or human derived 
materials are added during the manufacturing process or to the final medicinal product. 
Compared to the currently licensed strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 100 IU and 2000 IU), the intended 
higher strengths of 2500 IU/vial, 3000 IU/vial and 4000 IU/vial are manufactured identically up to and 
including the active substance (AS) level. There are no changes to the manufacture of the active 
substance. Changes to the 3.2.S. section of the dossier are related to some analytical methods which 
needed adaptation of e.g. dilutions due to the higher BDD-rFVIII concentrations and to the section 
Characterisation (3.2.S.3) in which results of comparability studies with respect to biological activity, 
physico-chemical characteristics as well as the impurity profile have been provided. These studies are 
presented and discussed in the finished product section below.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Nuwiq finished product is a white sterile lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. The 
lyophilised powder is supplied in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 
IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU of recombinant factor VIII per vial. The finished product is formulated with 
sodium chloride, sucrose, calcium chloride dihydrate, arginine hydrochloride, sodium citrate dihydrate, 
poloxamer 188. Before use, the lyophilised powder is reconstituted with a single-dose solvent pre-filled 
syringe containing 2.5 mL of sterilised water for injections. The reconstituted solution is a clear, 
colourless solution, practically free from visible particles containing 100 IU / 200 IU / 400 IU / 800 IU / 
1000 IU / 1200 IU / 1600 IU FVIII:C/mL. The concentration of each of the excipients is the same for all 
strengths, only the recombinant FVIII concentration varies. All excipients are of Ph. Eur. quality.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
Commercial production of Nuwiq active substance was initially performed and validated in a bioreactor 
scale production line. Commercial Nuwiq finished product is produced at the pharmaceutical production 
line. The production process of Nuwiq was presented within the initial marketing authorisation 
application (MAA). 
Subsequently, the production process of Nuwiq has been scaled up, “Bio1”, with resulting larger scale 
purification to active substance (AS) and commercial pharmaceutical production of finished product 
(FP) in a new pharmaceutical line for filling of small volume parenterals (SVP) hereafter referred to as 
“Bio1 DP (SVP)”. The Bio1/Bio1 DP SVP production process of Nuwiq was presented as a variation 
application and has been approved in March 2017. 
This line extension applies for the addition of the new product strengths of 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 
IU in addition to the currently approved product strengths 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU. 
Concerning the line extension, a Process validation (PV) has been performed for these new Nuwiq 
strengths in Bio1 DP SVP. 
In relation to pharmaceutical development compatibility of Nuwiq finished product new strengths with 
the components used for reconstitution and injection of the product, including the 2.5 mL sterilized 
water for injections in a prefilled syringe was shown in study OC16-0517 and revealed no concerns 
regarding compatibility of Nuwiq new strengths with reconstitution and injection devices. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Nuwiq finished product Bio1 DP SVP is identical compared to the 
approved manufacturing process. The “Method of Preparation” was updated with strength-specific 
details to include the new product strengths of 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU. The in-process controls 
and the control of critical steps have not been affected.  
A batch of finished product has been defined as containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 IU Nuwiq 
per vial or containing 2500 IU, 3000 IU or 4000 IU Nuwiq per vial, corresponding to approximately 1-
36 Mio IU Factor VIII.

Process validation 
Process validation was performed for the pharmaceutical production of Nuwiq new product strengths 
from thawing and pooling of active substance to final container finished product in the SVP production 
line.  
Process validation included five finished product batches using a bracketing approach covering all three 
strengths, minimum and maximum batch sizes and all identical freeze-dryers. Maximum hold times 
were challenged for one batch of each strength. Process control parameters and quality attributes 
determined at each manufacturing step were within acceptance criteria and comparable to ranges 
observed for Bio1 process validation batches of Nuwiq 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 IU/vial.  
Product specification 
Specifications of Nuwiq finished product are unchanged except the strength-specific parameter potency 
and total protein.  
Due to the new strengths and higher protein concentrations the test methods electrophoretic 
examination, factor VIII chromogenic test and molecular size distribution and the validations for 
endotoxin, sterility and molecular size distribution were adequately updated.  
Batch release testing results confirmed the consistent manufacture of batches of the new strengths 
within specifications.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data for 5 batches Nuwiq (1x 2500 IU/vial, 1x 3000 IU/vial and 3x 4000 IU/vial) as well as 12 
months for 1 batch (1x 4000 IU/vial) for storage at 5°C have been provided in compliance with ICH 
Q5C. Stability at 25°C is completed for all 5 batches. Three batches, one of each strength, were also 
stored at 30°C for 6 months. Reconstitution studies were performed on one batch of the respective 
strength 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU and covered 12 months storage at 5°C followed by 
reconstitution and storage at 25°C up to 24 hours. 
Photo stability studies indicated a slight loss in FVIII potency and specific activity, when stored under 
light, requiring storage of the vials protected from light. A respective statement is included in the 
product information. 
Parameters tested are appearance, visual inspection of solution, solubility, pH value, FVIII:C, total 
protein, specific FVIII:C activity, retention times and molecular size distribution by size-exclusion high 
performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC), electrophoretic examination by sodium dodecyl 
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), osmolality, water content, integrity testing by 
head space analysis, sterility, endotoxin, particulate matter and concentrations of citrate, sucrose, 
poloxamer 188, sodium, calcium, chloride and arginine. 
The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life of 24 months at 2°C – 
8°C. During the shelf life, the product can be kept at room temperature (up to 25°C) for a single 
period not exceeding 1 month. Once the product has been taken out of the refrigerator it must not be 
returned to the refrigerator. Within the proposed shelf life the finished product is stable up to 24 hours 
after reconstitution when stored at room temperature. From a microbiological point of view, the 
product should be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times 
and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.

Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product 
Compared to the currently licensed strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 100 IU and 2000 IU), the intended 
higher strengths of 2500 IU/vial to 4000 IU/vial are manufactured identically up to and including the 
active substance (AS) level. 
The higher strength vials require the processing of higher Nuwiq concentrations during finished product 
manufacturing. As this process change may affect the biological activity profile of Nuwiq downstream 
of the change, the biological activity of the 2500-4000 IU/vial process validation finished product 
batches were analysed in parallel to reference batches from both the original bioreactor and Bio1 DP. 
For the 2500-4000 IU/vial process validation batches, all earlier process steps up to and including AS 
were already characterised previously (230CBA139/BIO1/01). 
The process validation for higher strength Nuwiq comprised two independent campaigns resulting in six 
FP batches, with one 2500 IU/vial batch, one 3000 IU/vial batch, and four 4000 IU/vial batches.  
To demonstrate comparability between the new product strengths and current product strengths, 
comparability with respect to biological activity, physico-chemical characterisation as well as impurity 
profile was addressed.  
Biological activity 
For evaluation of comparability with respect to biological activity the following methods were applied: 
- FVIII activity (chromogenic assay, Coatest SP FVIII kit) 
- Specific activity 
- FVIII activity/FVIII:Antigen ratio (Asserachrom VIII:Ag kit) 
- Thrombin generation 
- FXa generation 
- Interaction with Activated Protein C 
- vWF binding 
Based on the provided data for 6 batches of the new strengths and the data for 8 batches of the 
already licensed strengths, the new strengths showed comparable characteristics in all assays.  
Physico-chemical characterisation 
Physico-chemical characterisation included SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions with 
silver staining, protein chip capillary electrophoresis, intrinsic fluorescence, asymetrical flow field-flow 
fractionation and HPLC gel filtration. The data support comparability between the currently approved 
and the new Nuwiq strengths regarding these parameters. 
Process related impurities 
Analysis for impurities included testing for endotoxins, sterility, host cell protein (HCP) as well as 
aggregates and degradation products. The data support comparability between the currently approved 
and the new Nuwiq strengths regarding the impurity profile. 
In conclusion, comparability data provided for the addition of the 3 higher Nuwiq strengths showed 
comparability with the currently licensed strengths.

Adventitious agents 
The virus and TSE safety of human-cl rhFVIII has been sufficiently demonstrated. Human-cl rhFVIII is 
considered safe with respect to a potential transmission of TSE and viruses. There were no changes to 
the currently approved MAA for Nuwiq. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This line extension application concerns the addition of three new strengths for Nuwiq (2500 IU, 3000 
IU and 4000 IU per vial). There are no changes to the manufacture of the active substance.  
The new strengths differ only in the amount of active substance per vial. All the other excipients have 
the same concentrations. The solvent for reconstitution (WfI) as well as the primary packaging are also 
unchanged. 
Process validation studies confirmed that the new strengths can be manufactured consistently within 
specifications. A comparability study of finished product batches with the proposed new versus the 
approved old strengths revealed comparability with respect to biological activity, physico-chemical 
characteristics and impurities. 
The stability program is in general considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability 
studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Sufficiently detailed data and documents have been provided indicating that the product can be 
reproducibly manufactured and is adequately controlled.  
Based on the review of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that this extension application to 
the marketing authorisation for Nuwiq is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This extension application concerns the introduction of new product strengths 2500 IU (1000 IU/ml), 
3000 IU (1200 IU/ml) and 4000 IU (1600 IU/ml) in addition to the currently approved strengths. The 
extension application is based on quality data and on non-clinical local tolerance data. 
The non-clinical data package comprising pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data has 
been assessed in the course of the marketing authorisation procedure and is still applicable for the 
current extension procedure.  
Therefore, only a new local tolerance study was performed as part of this application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/114079/2018  
Page 10/17 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Toxicology 
Local tolerance  
A local tolerance study of Drug Product following a single perivenous administration in rabbits was 
performed as follows: 
Local tolerance study of four Nuwiq strengths following a single perivenous administration 
in rabbits) 
96 hours after administration all animals were sacrificed and tissue samples of the injection sites were 
examined macroscopically and then collected and prepared for microscopic examination.  
Macroscopic inspection of the application sites did not reveal any changes. Furthermore, the 
histomorphological examination of 16 ear localizations of rabbits did not reveal any morphological 
changes in the perivascular region of the ear which are considered to be test item-related. The 
haemorrhages and the minimal inflammatory reactions were regarded to be caused by the technical 
procedure. Signs of systemic toxicity did not occur. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Considering the result of the new local tolerance study performed as bridging study to assess the local 
tolerance of the new vial strengths of Nuwiq, e.g. 2500 IU, 3000 IU, 4000 IU, in addition to the already 
approved strength 2000 IU it could be concluded that perivenous injections of 0.2 mL/ear of all four 
Nuwiq product strengths tested were well tolerated and did not reveal any test item-related changes at 
the injection site. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data do not give rise for concern, and are considered to be adequate to support the 
comparability of the different strengths of Nuwiq. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted with this Extension application which is justified by the MAH 
based on comparability data investigating the old and the new strengths and supported by the results 
of a local tolerance study. This is considered acceptable. 
Additionally, the applicant proposes to collect clinical data on the new Nuwiq product strengths within 
the frame of the non-interventional GENA-99 post-authorisation study. 
2.4.1.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nuwiq (simoctocog alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The manufacture of Nuwiq 2500 IU/vial, 3000 IU/vial and 4000 IU/vial has been sufficiently validated 
and finished product quality attributes for the new strengths have been found comparable to those of 
the other strengths.  
The additional non-clinical data, submitted with this application, are considered to be adequate to 
support the comparability of the different strengths of Nuwiq. 
The MAH proposes to collect clinical data on the new Nuwiq product strengths within the frame of the 
non-interventional GENA-99 post-authorisation study. 
Based on the available information the Benefit/Risk Balance of Nuwiq remains unchanged. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit-Risk of Nuwiq is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit 
balance of the new strengths Nuwiq 2500 IU (1000 IU/ml), 3000 IU (1200 IU/ml) and 4000 IU (1600 
IU/ml) is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). Nuwiq can be used for all age groups 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Nuwiq subject to 
the following conditions:

updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States.

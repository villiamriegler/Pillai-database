Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Nevanac, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
Following reports of one case of “corneal perforation” within this PSUR, a search of EudraVigilance was 
performed which revealed two medically confirmed ICSRs during the reporting interval, and two 
medically confirmed ICSRs and one non-medically confirmed ICSR cumulatively and outside the 
reporting period. 
Due to the cumulative number of ICSRs with a plausible temporal association with nepafenac, the 
severity of the reaction, which is a sight-threatening condition, and considering that corneal perforation 
is already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of similar topical NSAIDs from the same pharmacological 
class, the PRAC recommends to include corneal perforation in section 4.8 of the SmPC for nepafenac. 
For the purpose of clarity, the PRAC also recommended to cross-reference this information to the 
appropriate wording in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The Patient Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding corneal perforation, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Nevanac, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance nepafenac is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

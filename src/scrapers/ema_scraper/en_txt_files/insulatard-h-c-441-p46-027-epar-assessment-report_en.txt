1.  Introduction 
On December the 1st 2016, the MAH submitted a paediatric study for Insulatard, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The trial was considered a Post Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) and Post Authorisation Safety 
Study (PASS). 
Insulin NPH (Insulatard) is a neutral suspension of isophane insulin human crystals formulated for long 
action. Insulin NPH is intended to cover the basal insulin requirements of people with T1DM and T2DM, 
and may be used alone or in combination with fast- or rapid-acting insulin. 
Insulin NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood glucose level of those with 
diabetes. In insulin NPH, protamine prolongs the dissociation time of the hexameric insulin molecules 
to the monomeric form. The absorption following the dissociation results in non-physiological insulin 
levels with initial hyper insulinaemia and thereby a risk of hypoglycaemia, mainly during the night. In 
addition, the currently available protracted formulations such as insulin NPH also have high intra-
subject variation with regard to absorption. The day-to-day intra subject variation has previously been 
reported to be in the range 20−30%. 
For further details please see the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC). 
Currently an increased number of children and adolescents are diagnosed with T2DM, as a 
consequence of the global obesity epidemic. The treatment options for these patients are not fully 
explored, and an insulin analogue offering less weight gain and a reduced number of hypoglycaemic 
episodes could be a choice. 
Trial NN304-4093 was conducted to evaluate the benefit and risks of IDet in combination with the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metformin, including complete metformin intolerance, administered 
to children and adolescents (aged 10–17 years) with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on the 
MTD of metformin ± other OAD(s) ± basal insulin at the time of enrolment in the trial. 
Trial NN304-4093 (henceforth referred to as trial 4093) was terminated early due to a very slow 
recruitment rate. A total of 42 subjects were enrolled and randomised in this trial instead of 358 
subjects as originally planned for enrolment. The decision to discontinue recruitment for the trial was 
not due to any safety concerns, and the trial did not reveal any safety issues. The study was not part 
of the paediatric development program for Insulatard.

study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Formulation in trial NN304-4093 
IDet (Levemir) formulation contains 100 U/mL IDet (produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by 
recombinant DNA technology) and other excipients (glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc acetate, 
disodium phosphate dihydrate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium 
hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections). 
Insulin NPH (Insulatard, Protaphane, Novolin N) contains 100 IU/mL isophane (NPH) insulin (produced 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology) and other excipients (zinc chloride, 
glycerol, metacresol, phenol, disodium phosphate dihydrate, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), protamine sulfate and water for injections). 
Device for subcutaneous injection in trial NN304-4093 
IDet (Levemir) 100 U/mL was supplied in a 3 mL prefilled FlexPen. Levemir FlexPen is a pre-filled pen 
designed to be used with NovoFine disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm. FlexPen delivers 1−60 
U in increments of 1 U. 
Insulin NPH (Insulatard, Protaphane, Novolin N) 100 IU/mL was supplied in a 3 mL pre-filled FlexPen. 
One pre-filled pen contains 3 mL equivalent to 300 IU. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final abbreviated clinical trial report for: 
•  The MAH stated that study NN304-4093, a 26-week open label, randomised, 2-armed, parallel 
group, multi-centre trial investigating efficacy and safety of insulin detemir versus insulin 
neutral protamine Hagedorn in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of metformin 
and diet/exercise on glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes 
insufficiently controlled on the maximum tolerated dose of metformin ± other oral antidiabetic 
drug(s) ± basal insulin 
This was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group trial in subjects with 
type 2 diabetes aged 10–17 years, who were insufficiently treated with the MTD of metformin ± other 
OAD(s) ± basal insulin. The trial design is shown schematically in Figure 1. 
The trial period consisted of a 2-week screening period and a 26-week treatment period.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: 
•  To compare the efficacy of insulin detemir (IDet) in combination with the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of metformin and diet/exercise versus insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in 
combination with the MTD of metformin and diet/exercise in controlling glycaemia, after 26 
weeks of treatment, in children and adolescents (aged 10–17 years) with type 2 diabetes, who 
are insufficiently treated with the MTD of metformin ± other oral anti-diabetic drugs (OAD(s)) 
± basal insulin. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To compare the efficacy of insulin detemir in combination with the MTD of metformin and 
diet/exercise versus insulin NPH in combination with the MTD of metformin and diet/exercise 
on body weight, after 26 weeks of treatment, in children and adolescents (aged 10–17 years) 
with type 2 diabetes, who are insufficiently treated with the MTD of metformin ± other OAD(s) 
± basal insulin.

•  To compare the proportion of subjects achieving glycaemic control without experiencing severe 
hypoglycaemia, after 26 weeks of treatment, for insulin detemir in combination with the MTD 
of metformin and diet/exercise versus insulin NPH in combination with the MTD of metformin 
and diet/exercise, in children and adolescents (aged 10-17 years) with type 2 diabetes, who 
are insufficiently treated with the MTD of metformin ± other OAD(s) ± basal insulin. 
•  To assess and compare the safety and tolerability of insulin detemir in combination with the 
MTD of metformin and diet/exercise versus insulin NPH in combination with the MTD of 
metformin and diet/exercise, during 26 weeks of treatment, in children and adolescents (aged 
10−17 years) with type 2 diabetes, who are insufficiently treated with the MTD of metformin ± 
other OAD(s) ± basal insulin. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The objectives are stated clearly and considered relevant. 
Study design 
This was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group trial in subjects with 
type 2 diabetes aged 10–17 years, who were insufficiently treated with the MTD of metformin ± other 
OAD(s) ± basal insulin. 
An open labelled trial design was chosen as it was not possible to blind the 2 formulations (insulin NPH 
is a suspension while IDet is a solution). 
For both treatment arms, a diet/exercise intervention was introduced, which was expected to further 
improve glycaemic control for the children and adolescents. Also, providing diet/exercise intervention 
to these patients may improve their motivation and be an added benefit as they are likely to put on 
weight when receiving insulin. 
Twenty-six (26) weeks of treatment was chosen as this period was sufficient for the evaluation of the 
primary endpoint and the safety profile. 
Stratification was included to secure an equal distribution of age groups and subjects, who had 
previously been treated with metformin in combination with other OAD(s) within the two treatment 
arms. 
The trial was designed in accordance with requirements for adequate and well-controlled trials. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The design is acceptable. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 358 subjects were planned for enrolment. Subjects were children and adolescents aged 
10−17 years with T2DM. 
Subject selection was based on the inclusion and exclusion, see below. Subjects who met all of the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were eligible to participate in the trial.

Inclusion criteria: 
1. Informed consent from the subject or a legally acceptable representative and child assent from the 
subject obtained before any trial-related activities. Trial-related activities are any procedures that are 
carried out as part of the trial, including activities to determine suitability for the trial 
2. Male or female, 10 years ≤ age ≤ 17 years at the time of signing informed consent/assent 
3. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at least 3 months prior to screening 
4. Treated with the maximum tolerated stable dose of metformin for at least 3 months prior to 
screening or have documented complete metformin intolerance 
5. HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.5% (≥ 53 mmol/mol and ≤ 91 mmol/mol) at 
screening 
Exclusion criteria: 
1. Maturity onset diabetes of the young 
2. Fasting C-peptide at screening below 0.6 ng/mL 
3. Impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase above or equal to 2.5 times upper 
normal limit 
4. Known proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment as judged by the 
investigator 
5. Treatment with any medication for the indication of diabetes or obesity other than stated in the 
inclusion criteria in a period of 3 months before the day of screening 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomised to receive either IDet or insulin NPH, both administered 
subcutaneously. During the treatment period, the basal insulin dose was determined by a 2-4-6-8 
titration algorithm (titration of insulin dose by 2, 4, 6 or 8 units based on average pre-breakfast or pre-
dinner self-measured plasma glucose values). The treatment with metformin was continued unchanged 
during the treatment period, while treatment with other OAD(s) and basal insulin were discontinued. 
The diet/exercise intervention was performed through changes in eating and activity behaviours. 
The randomisation was stratified according to age and prior antidiabetic therapy. 
A DMC was established to independently review and evaluate accumulating safety data from the trial in 
order to protect the safety of the subjects and to evaluate the benefit and risk assessment.

Rapporteur’s comments 
Endpoints are considered relevant. 
Statistical Methods 
At least 358 subjects were planned to be randomised in order to ensure 80% power to show non-
inferiority of IDet to insulin NPH in the full analysis set and per protocol (PP) analysis set with respect 
to change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26, using a non-inferiority limit of 0.4%. However, the trial 
was discontinued post randomisation of 42 subjects due to a very slow recruitment rate. As a result of 
the limited number of subjects enrolled in the trial, none of the planned statistical analyses described 
in the protocol for the secondary efficacy endpoints and for the safety endpoints, were performed. 
Analysis sets 
• 
Full analysis set – included all randomised subjects 
•  PP analysis set – included all randomised subjects, not violating any of the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and that had been treated for at least 12 weeks. Subjects in the PP analysis set 
contributed to the evaluation ‘as treated’ 
•  Safety analysis set – included all subjects receiving at least one dose of randomised treatment. 
Subjects in the safety analysis set contributed to the evaluation ‘as treated’ 
All the 42 exposed subjects were included in the full and safety analysis sets, but 7 subjects were 
excluded from PP analysis set (5 subjects were incorrectly stratified at the time of randomisation, 1 
subject was randomised in error and 1 subject was treated for less than 12 weeks). 
The primary endpoint of change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 was analysed using a mixed model 
for repeated measurements with treatment, age group, prior antidiabetic therapy, and the interaction

between age group and prior antidiabetic therapy as factors, and baseline HbA1c as a covariate, all 
variables nested within week as factor. The treatment difference at week 26 was estimated and the 
corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval was calculated. The data from secondary endpoints 
were summarised using descriptive statistics. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Statistical methods are in line with guidelines. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 71 subjects were screened, of which 29 were screening failures. The majority of screening 
failures did not meet the inclusion criterion number 5 (HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.5% inclusive). 
Of the 42 subjects who were randomised, 39 subjects completed the trial. Of the 3 subjects who 
withdrew from the trial, 2 subjects in the insulin NPH group withdrew consent and 1 subject in the IDet 
group was withdrawn due to a withdrawal criterion (persistent hyperglycaemia despite initiation of 
rescue medication) (Table 1).

Demographic and Baseline data 
Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. 
The mean age of subjects was 15 years (range: 10–17 years), and the majority of them were females 
(64.3%) (Table 2).  
The mean duration of diabetes in subjects was 2.8 years (range: 0.3−7.8 years) with baseline HbA1c of 
8.84% (range: 7.1−10.5%) and FPG of 9.15 mmol/L (range: 4.5−18.2 mmol/L). One subject in the 
IDet group had diabetic nephropathy at screening. 
Subjects treated with MTD of metformin were enrolled in this trial. The mean dose of metformin 
received by subjects at screening was 1802.4 mg per day. 
The most common concomitant illnesses reported were from the system organ class of ‘metabolism 
and nutrition disorders’. Obesity (14.3%) and hyperlipidaemia (11.9%) were the most commonly 
reported concomitant illnesses. The concomitant medications reported by the subjects generally 
reflected the concomitant illnesses reported.

Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint – Change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (end of trial) 
The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.72% in the IDet group and 8.95% in the insulin NPH group. The 
observed mean HbA1c decreased throughout the trial in both the treatment groups. At the end of trial, 
mean HbA1c had decreased by 0.610 %-points to 8.11 % in the IDet group and by 0.836 %-points to 
8.11% in the insulin NPH group (Table 3).

The estimated mean treatment difference of change from baseline in HbA1c between IDet and insulin 
NPH at the end of trial was 0.17% [95% CI: -0.74; 1.09]. However, efficacy conclusions could not be 
drawn from this primary analysis due to the low number of subjects included in the trial. 
Mean HbA1c and change from baseline in HbA1c by visit for the PP analysis set was similar to the FAS.  
Secondary endpoints 
Confirmatory secondary endpoints 
The following endpoints were planned to be confirmatory; however, due to the low number of subjects 
in the trial, these secondary endpoints were no longer considered to be confirmatory. 
•  Change in body weight SDS from baseline to week 26 
•  Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7.0% at week 26, who have not experienced any 
treatment-emergent severe hypoglycaemic episodes within the last 14 weeks of treatment 
Change in body weight SDS from baseline to week 26 (end of trial) 
The observed mean change from baseline in body weight SDS at the end of trial was 0.006 in the IDet 
group and 0.098 in the insulin NPH group (Table 4).

Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7.0% at week 26 (end of trial) without treatment-emergent 
severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
The proportion of subjects who achieved HbA1c <7.0% without severe treatment-emergent 
hypoglycaemic episodes within the last 14 weeks of treatment at the end of trial was 25.0% in the 
IDet group and 33.3 % in the insulin NPH group (Table 5).

Supportive secondary endpoints 
Responders for HbA1c at week 26 (end of trial) 
Proportion of subjects who achieved HbA1c <7.0% at the end of trial: 25.0% subjects in the IDet group 
and 31.8% subjects in the insulin NPH group. 
Proportion of subjects who achieved HbA1c <7.5% at the end of trial: 30.0% subjects in the IDet group 
and 36.4% subjects in the insulin NPH group. 
Proportion of subjects who achieved HbA1c <7.5% without treatment-emergent severe hypoglycaemic 
episodes within the last 14 weeks of treatment at the end of trial: 30.0% in the IDet group and 38.1 % 
in the insulin NPH group. 
7-point SMPG profiles at week 26 (end of trial) 
All the 7-point SMPG values decreased from baseline in both the treatment groups at the end of trial. 
In both the treatment groups, the mean 7-point SMPG profiles decreased from baseline to the end of 
trial (Table 6). The observed mean at baseline was 9.76 mmol/L in the IDet group and 10.99 mmol/L 
in the insulin NPH group. The observed mean decreased to 8.28 mmol/L in the IDet group and 8.45 
mmol/L in the insulin NPH group by the end of trial.

Change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 26 (end of trial) 
The observed mean FPG at baseline was 7.99 mmol/L in the IDet group and 10.20 mmol/L in the 
insulin NPH group. The higher mean baseline values observed in the insulin NPH group were mainly 
due to 4 subjects having high baseline FPG values. This led to a mean change in FPG from baseline to 
the end of trial of -0.335 mmol/L in the IDet group and -2.332 mmol/L in the insulin NPH group (Table 
7).

Body measurements 
Change in body weight from baseline to week 26 (end of trial) 
At baseline, the observed mean body weight was 75.9 kg in the IDet group and 73.2 kg in the insulin 
NPH group. The mean body weight slightly increased from baseline to the end of trial in both the 
treatment groups. The observed mean weight change from baseline to the end of trial was 1.89 kg in 
the IDet group and 4.00 kg in the insulin NPH group (Table 8).

At baseline, the mean height SDS was -0.087 in the IDet group and -0.166 in the insulin NPH group. 
The change in height SDS from baseline to the end of trial was -0.042 in the IDet group and -0.019 in 
the insulin NPH group. 
Change in BMI and BMI SDS from baseline to week 26 (end of trial) 
At baseline, the mean BMI was 28.74 kg/m2 in the IDet group and 27.70 kg/m2 in the insulin NPH 
group. The change in BMI from baseline to the end of trial was 0.35 kg/m2 in the IDet group and 1.20 
kg/m2 in the insulin NPH group. 
At baseline, the mean BMI SDS was 1.681 in the IDet group and 1.452 in the insulin NPH group.

Efficacy conclusions 
The trial was terminated early due to a slow recruitment rate. No efficacy conclusions could be drawn 
due to the low number of subjects included in the trial. The efficacy results are presented 
below: 
•  The estimated mean treatment difference of change from baseline in HbA1c between IDet and 
insulin NPH at the end of trial was 0.17% [95% CI: -0.74; 1.09]. The observed mean change 
in HbA1c from baseline to the end of trial was -0.610% in the IDet group and -0.836% in the 
insulin NPH group 
•  The observed mean weight change from baseline to the end of trial was 1.89 kg in the IDet 
group and 4.00 kg in the insulin NPH group  
•  The proportion of responders with HbA1c <7.0% without severe treatment-emergent 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the last 14 weeks of treatment at the end of trial was 25.0% in the 
IDet group and 33.3% in the insulin NPH group 
•  The proportion of responders with HbA1c <7.5% without severe treatment-emergent 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the last 14 weeks of treatment at the end of trial was 30.0% in the 
IDet group and 38.1 % in the insulin NPH group 
•  The observed mean of the mean 7-point SMPG profiles at the end of trial was 8.28 mmol/L in 
the IDet group and 8.45 mmol/L in the insulin NPH group 
•  The observed mean change in FPG from baseline to the end of trial was -0.335 mmol/L in the 
IDet group and -2.332 mmol/L in the insulin NPH group 
•  The observed mean change in body weight from baseline to the end of trial was 1.89 kg in the 
IDet group and 4.00 kg in the insulin NPH group 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Since the trial was terminated early due to a slow recruitment rate and therefore a low number of 
subjects were included in the trial, no firm efficacy conclusions could be drawn. However, overall the 
results are in line with the known effects of insulin in adults with regards to glucose lowering and 
weight gain. 
Both treatments resulted in a reduction of HbA1c compared to baseline. With an observed mean HbA1c 
baseline values decreased from 8.72% to 8.11% in the IDet group and from 8.95% to 8.11% in the 
insulin NPH group at the end of trial. 
Body weight gain was seen for both the treatments, but was lower for the IDet group.

Safety results 
Extent of exposure 
A total of 42 subjects were exposed to trial products; 20 subjects to IDet and 22 subjects to insulin 
NPH. The total exposure (in subject years) was 9.83 years in the IDet group and 10.49 years in the 
insulin NPH group (Table 9). Approximately 95% of the total subjects in both the treatment groups 
were exposed to the trial products for 20−26 weeks. 
Table 9 Summary of exposure by treatment - full analysis set 
Brief summary of adverse events 
A total of 30 AEs were reported in 8 subjects in the IDet group (rate: 305.1 events per 100 patient 
years of exposure (PYE)) and 41 AEs were reported in 13 subjects in the insulin NPH group (rate: 
390.7 events per 100 PYE). The majority of AEs were non-serious, mild in severity and unlikely related 
to trial product. Subjects recovered or were recovering from all the AEs except 2 AEs which were not 
resolved at the end of the trial (Table 10). 
The most frequently reported AEs (in ≥10% of subjects in any of the two treatment groups) were 
gastroenteritis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia and vomiting. 
No deaths were reported in this trial. One SAE was reported in the insulin NPH group that was 
moderate in severity and was considered unlikely related to the trial product. 
No AEs led to withdrawal from the trial.

Deaths and other serious adverse events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during this trial. 
Serious adverse events 
Overall, only 1 SAE (migraine) was reported in this trial by a subject from the insulin NPH group (Table 
12). The event was moderate in severity, unlikely related to the trial product and the subject recovered 
from the event. The trial product was temporarily interrupted due to this SAE.  
Table 12 Treatment-emergent serious adverse events by system organ class and preferred term – 
summary - safety analysis set 
No SAEs occurred in ≥5% or ≥10% of the subjects. No SAEs were possibly or probably related to trial 
product.

Other significant adverse events 
No subjects withdrew from the trial due to AEs. A total of 3 AEs and 1 SAE experienced by 1 subject in 
the insulin NPH group led to temporary trial product interruption. No AEs led to dose reduction. No 
MESIs were reported (Table 10). 
No AEs related to clinical laboratory abnormalities were reported. 
No AEs related to abnormal vital signs, physical examinations or other safety assessment evaluations 
were reported. 
Suspected hypersensitive events were derived using the standard MedDRA queries. 
Two suspected hypersensitivity events (rhinitis allergic in the IDet group and multiple allergies in the 
insulin NPH group) were reported by two subjects (Table 13). Both events were mild in severity and 
unlikely related to trial products. Subjects had recovered from both events at the end of the trial. 
Table 13 Treatment-emergent suspected hypersensitive events by system organ class and preferred 
term – summary - safety analysis set 
One subject in the IDet group had an AE of localised injection site erythema. This AE was mild in 
severity, possibly related to the trial product and the subject recovered from the event. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemic episodes 
Hypoglycaemic episodes are summarised by classification in Table 14. There were no severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes in any of the treatment groups. The overall event rate of hypoglycaemia per

Vital signs 
There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs from baseline to the end of the trial in any of 
the treatment groups. 
Physical examination 
No abnormal physical examination findings were observed in any of the two treatment groups at the 
end of trial. 
Pubertal assessments 
Pubertal assessments done at baseline and at the end of trial are summarised in Table 17. The 
majority of subjects had Tanner Grade 5 (71.4%) at baseline. The pubertal changes observed in this 
trial were normal as expected with this trial population.

Rapporteur’s comments 
The rate of AEs related to trial drug was higher in the NPH group compared to IDet (390.7 vs. 305.1 
events per 100 PYE, respectively). In this regard, the most frequently reported AE was gastroenteritis, 
headache, oropharyngeal pain, pain, pyrexia and vomiting. The majority of AEs were non-serious, mild 
in severity and unlikely related to trial product. No severe AEs were reported in this trial and no deaths 
occurred during the trial. 
There were no severe hypoglycaemic episodes in any of the treatment groups. The overall event rate 
of hypoglycaemia per 100 PYE was 172.9 in the IDet group and 533.6 in the insulin NPH group. There 
were no severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes in any of the treatment groups. The overall event 
rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia per 100 PYE was 40.7 in the IDet group and 76.2 in the insulin NPH 
group. 
No clinically relevant differences from baseline to end of treatment or between the two treatment 
groups were observed for vital signs, physical examination, laboratory values and antibody 
development.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
With this submission a final abbreviated clinical trial report for study NN304-4093, a 26-week open 
label, randomised, 2-armed, parallel group, multi-centre trial investigating efficacy and safety of 
insulin detemir versus insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn in combination with the maximum tolerated 
dose of metformin and diet/exercise on glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 2 
diabetes insufficiently controlled on the maximum tolerated dose of metformin ± other oral antidiabetic 
drug(s) ± basal insulin was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
The study was not part of the paediatric development program for Insulatard. 
The primary objective of the trial was to compare the efficacy of IDet and NPH in controlling glycaemia 
in children and adolescents (aged 10−17 years) with T2DM, who were previously insufficiently treated 
with the MTD of metformin ± other OAD(s) ± basal insulin.  
The secondary objective was to compare the efficacy of the two treatments in managing body weight 
and in achieving glycaemic control without experiencing severe hypoglycaemia and to assess and 
compare the safety and tolerability between the two treatments and safety between the two treatment 
groups. 
The general study design was adequate. A randomised, open-label trial was chosen since it was not 
possible to blind the 2 formulations (insulin NPH is a suspension while IDet is a solution). This is 
acceptable.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate. Due to the rise in the incidence of T2DM noted in 
many countries, as a consequence of the global obesity epidemic. The treatment options for these 
patients are not fully explored, and an insulin analogue offering less weight gain and a reduced number 
of hypoglycaemic episodes could be a choice. 
The choice of comparator NPH is acceptable, since both treatments are approved in the paediatric 
population.

The statistical methods were adequate. At least 358 subjects were planned to be randomised in order 
to ensure 80% power to show non-inferiority of IDet to insulin NPH in the full analysis set and per 
protocol (PP) analysis set with respect to change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26, using a non-
inferiority limit of 0.4%. However, the trial was discontinued post randomisation of 42 subjects due to 
a very slow recruitment rate. As a result of the limited number of subjects enrolled in the trial, none of 
the planned statistical analyses described in the protocol for the efficacy endpoints and for the safety 
endpoints, were performed. 
The study included 42 subjects randomised 1:1 to the two treatment groups where 39 subjects 
completed the trial. The baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between groups. The 
mean age of subjects was 15 years (range: 10–17 years), and the majority of them were females 
(64.3%) 
No efficacy conclusions could be drawn since the trial was terminated early due to a slow recruitment 
rate and therefore a low number of subjects were included in the trial. But both treatments resulted in 
a reduction of HbA1c compared to baseline. With an observed mean HbA1c baseline values decreased 
from 8.72% to 8.11% in the IDet group and from 8.95% to 8.11% in the insulin NPH group at the end 
of trial. Body weight gain was seen for both the treatments, but was lower for the IDet group (1.89 kg 
in the IDet group compared to 4.00 kg in the insulin NPH group.  
The rate of AEs related to trial drug was higher in the NPH group compared to IDet (390.7 vs. 305.1 
events per 100 PYE, respectively). In this regard, the most frequently reported AE was gastroenteritis, 
headache, oropharyngeal pain, pain, pyrexia and vomiting. The majority of AEs were non-serious, mild 
in severity and unlikely related to trial product. No severe AEs were reported in this trial and no deaths 
occurred during the trial. 
There were no severe hypoglycaemic episodes in any of the treatment groups and the overall event 
rate of hypoglycaemia per 100 PYE was 172.9 in the IDet group and 533.6 in the insulin NPH group. 
No severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were seen in any of the treatment groups. The overall 
event rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia per 100 PYE was 40.7 in the IDet group and 76.2 in the insulin 
NPH group. 
No clinically relevant differences from baseline to end of treatment or between the two treatment 
groups were observed for vital signs, physical examination, laboratory values and antibody 
development.  
Thus the reporting of adverse events does not evoke any new safety concerns. 
In conclusion no efficacy conclusion could be made, since the number of subjects included in the trial 
was too low for assessment. No obvious differences between the two treatment groups with respect to 
AEs and standard safety parameters were seen and the early termination of the trial did not have any 
consequences on the overall benefit-risk assessment of Insulatard 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Based on the results of the paediatric trial assessed in this report, it is concluded that no regulatory 
consequences for the Marketing Authorisation for Insulatard was identified and no further action is 
required. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

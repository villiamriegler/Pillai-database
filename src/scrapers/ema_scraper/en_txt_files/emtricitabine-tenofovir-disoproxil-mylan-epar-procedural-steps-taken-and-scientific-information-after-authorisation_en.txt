Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan in the approved 
indication remains favourable and therefore recommended 
the renewal of the marketing authorisation with unlimited 
validity.

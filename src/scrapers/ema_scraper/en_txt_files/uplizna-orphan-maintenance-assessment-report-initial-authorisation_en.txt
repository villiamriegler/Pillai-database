2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2017 was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor AstraZeneca AB submitted on 25 October 2016 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
inebilizumab for treatment of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) (hereinafter referred 
to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention treat the condition with the medicinal product containing inebilizumab was considered 
justified based on pre-clinical in vivo data showing a depletion in the majority of tissue B cells and 
autoantibody-producing plasma cells, a reduction in pathogenic autoantibody titers, and a 
suppression of autoimmune CNS inflammation;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to neurological impairment such as 
paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-year mortality;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing inebilizumab, as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.” 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The proposed condition represents a group of severe autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating 
disorders that are typically characterized by optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. The 2015 consensus 
defines describes 5 core clinical characteristics: optic neuritis, acute myelitis, postrema syndrome, 
narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with typical MRI findings, symptomatic cerebral 
syndrome with MRI findings. In general, at least 2 core characteristics (for the NMOSD without 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMADOC-1700519818-787447  
Page 5/17 
 
 
 
autoantibodies) or 1 core characteristic and presence of autoantibodies are required (Wingerchuk, 
Neurology 2015; 85:1-13). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Uplizna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 
immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) seropositive” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition 
“treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP recommends the granting 
of the marketing authorisation for Uplizna on 11 November 2021. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the seriousness of the disease since designation. Since 
the original orphan designation for inebilizumab, Soliris (eculizumab) was approved for the treatment 
of Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) 
antibody-positive with a relapsing course of the disease. Further, Enspryng (satralizumab) was 
authorised as a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the 
treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients from 
12 years of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) seropositive. The impact of this approval on 
the morbidity and mortality of NMOSD has not yet been determined and reported in the literature. 
The COMP has previously considered that the condition is chronically debilitating due to neurological 
impairment such as paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, and central visual loss accompanied 
by ocular pain and life-threatening with the 5-year mortality reported as high as 30%. The seriousness 
of NMOSD is acknowledged. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has conducted a literature search and identified publications for the EU countries including 
Denmark (Asgari et al, 2011; Papp et al, 2019), and Austria (Aboul-Enein et al, 2013) are presented in

NMOSD defined per 2015 criteria including laboratory confirmed AQP4-IgG positivity 
The available EU studies have provided prevalence rates (Table 1) between 0.45 and 4.4 per 100,000 
for NMOSD (Aboul-Enein et al, 2013; Asgari et al, 2011; Papp et al, 2018; Cossburn et al, 2012; Jacob 
et al, 2013). A re-analysis of the data from the Denmark study has reported the prevalence of AQP4-
antibody-positive NMOSD at 1.68/100,000 (Asgari et al, 2019). 
Table 2 presents the reported data on NMOSD incidence. Incidence rate estimates range from 0.016 to 
0.4 per 100,000 person-years and cover all ages, in both the adult and paediatric populations (Aboul-

In summary, the collective evidence from EU studies continues to suggest that the population at risk 
for NMOSD remains 0.44 per 10,000 people, and consequently this meets the requirements for orphan 
designation.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Currently there are two products which have been authorised for this condition: 
•  Soliris is indicated (among others) in adults for the treatment of “Neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorder (NMOSD) in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive with a relapsing 
course of the disease”.  
•  Enspryng is indicated: “as a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) 
for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adult and adolescent 
patients from 12 years who are antiaquaporin 4 (AQP4) seropositive”. 
There are currently no pan-European guidelines for the treatment of the condition. A review of the 
treatment of the condition was published in 2016: Kessler R et al, Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2016 
January; 18(1): 2. 
The proposed therapeutic indication for Uplizna is “monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G 
(AQP4-IgG) seropositive.” 
The therapeutic indication for Soliris is narrower as it only covers patients with a “relapsing course of 
the disease”, while Uplizna can be used in non-relapsing patients. Therefore, Soliris would not be 
considered a satisfactory method to treat the exact same patient population as Uplizna. 
On the other hand, Enspryng has a full overlap with the Uplizna target patient population, wider in fact 
as it covers adolescent patients as well. Therefore, Enspryng is considered a satisfactory method for 
the target patient population of Uplizna and has to be considered for the evaluation of a possible 
significant benefit of Uplizna. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor received Scientific Advice (SA) in 2013 (EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/2013/III) and in 2015 
(EMEA/H/SA/2664/1/FU/1/2015/II). However, no specific questions were raised on the maintenance of 
orphan designation.  
The sponsor argued the existence of a significant benefit over Soliris in the maintenance report; but 
did not do the same versus Enspryng. It is acknowledged that Enspryng was only approved relatively 
recently (authorisation granted in June 2021); however, the recent authorisation of an orphan product 
does not mean that the recently authorised product should not be taken into account when evaluating 
whether a candidate orphan product (for the same target population) brings any significant benefit vis-
à-vis the already authorised treatments in the Union. Therefore, a justification of the significant benefit 
of Uplizna over Enspryng would be needed and a question was adopted by the COMP for this purpose. 
4.  COMP list of issues 
•  Significant benefit: 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMADOC-1700519818-787447  
Page 8/17 
 
 
 
The sponsor is requested to further elaborate on the significant benefit of their product within the 
context of the target population defined by their therapeutic indication and the population of an 
authorised products with a similar therapeutic indication namely Enspryng (satralizumab). Clinical data 
derived from studies conducted with the sponsor’s product should be used to support the basis of a 
clinically relevant advantage and/or major contribution to patient care compared with the currently 
authorised product.  
Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
The sponsor provided a written response and participated in an oral explanation.  
In their written response the sponsor further elaborated on the indirect comparison to satralizumab 
which has been recently authorised in Europe and it was highlighted that there were several difficulties 
in making an indirect comparison due to problems of accessibility to data for satralizumab.  
In their oral explanation the sponsor made several claims in support of the existence of a clinically 
relevant advantage, as well as a major contribution to patient care.  
The sponsor sought to substantiate the existence of a clinically relevant advantage by indirectly 
comparing their product against satralizumab on the basis of published data and data on file for 
inebilizumab. The sponsor had neither conducted a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) nor 
provided a comprehensive overview about the demographics and disease characteristics of the trial 
populations. The limitations of a descriptive naïve comparison and the importance of providing relevant 
information about the characteristics of the trial populations had been highlighted to the sponsor 
during the preparatory period before the oral explanation. In the absence of comprehensive 
information on the compared patient populations and in the absence of any population adjustment, the 
indirect comparison of inebilizumab and satralizumab may not be considered sufficiently robust for the 
purpose of establishing the claim of better efficacy.   
Regarding the sponsor’s claim of better efficacy of satralizumab on disability as measured by the 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) over a 4-year period, it was noted by COMP that the sponsor 
had used a dichotomised endpoint (worsening in EDSS) whereas the SAkuraStar trial for satralizumab 
had used a continuous endpoint (change in EDSS score from baseline). During the oral explanation, 
the sponsor explained that they had also performed an analysis of the continuous change in EDSS 
score from baseline resulting in a better point estimate than what was seen in the SAkuraStar trial. 
However, only limited details of what amounted to a descriptive comparison were shared by the 
sponsor with regards to this analysis. Furthermore, the COMP raised concerns that the results from the 
satralizumab trial were presented in seropositive and seronegative patients whereas the results for the 
sponsor’s product were presented in seropositive patients only. During the oral explanation the 
sponsor argued that serostatus would not impact the disability outcome; however, no rationale for this 
was provided. In addition to general concerns about the robustness of the presented indirect 
comparison, the COMP specifically did not consider that the sponsor provided convincing evidence to 
demonstrate better disability outcomes for inebilizumab as compared to satralizumab.  
During the oral explanation, the sponsor presented Kaplan-Meier figures on the time until attack / 
relapse for patients treated with inebilizumab or satralizumab in order to argue that long-term 
treatment consistently showed that a greater proportion remains attack-free under inebilizumab as 
compared to satralizumab. The sponsor highlighted point estimates of an estimated attack-free rate of 
83% under inebilizumab at week 208 versus an estimated relapse-free rate of 73% at week 192 under 
satralizumab monotherapy. The estimates were based on small sample sizes and no confidence 
intervals were provided. The Kaplan-Meier figures for inebilizumab and satralizumab were taken from 
two different publications (Rensel et al. (2021) and Kleiter et al. (2021)) and the sponsor provided no 
information to what extent relevant aspects of the studies were comparable (e.g. included patient 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMADOC-1700519818-787447  
Page 9/17 
 
 
 
populations, follow-up duration, outcome assessment). The level of evidence presented on this aspect 
was therefore considered insufficient to support the sponsor’s claim for better long-term attack-free 
rates under inebilizumab as compared to satralizumab. 
In view of the above, the COMP considers that the sponsor did not provide conclusive evidence of the 
existence a clinically relevant advantage of inebilizumab over satralizumab. 
Furthermore, the sponsor argued that their product could offer a major contribution to patient care 
based on the frequency and route of administration. The sponsor claimed that a twice-yearly 
intravenous administration would be preferred by patients over the monthly subcutaneous self- or 
hospital-administered injection required for satralizumab. To support this claim, the sponsor presented 
results from one patient preference survey in 329 Japanese patients. This was based on data on file 
and few details on the study (e.g. how patients were recruited or what were the primary objectives) 
were provided. It was noted by the COMP that the response categories were not designed to 
specifically compare only monthly subcutaneous administration with satralizumab versus intravenous 
administration every six months for inebilizumab. For example, two categories for monthly 
subcutaneous administration were included (at home or at the hospital). If the number of responders 
for the two subcutaneous administrations were added together this represented a similar or even 
larger proportion than the proportion who preferred intravenous administration. This was the only 
data/study submitted and discussed in support of the argument of major contribution to patient care. A 
more comprehensive overview of NMOSD patient preferences as well as a discussion on how the 
results from the Japanese study would translate to the EU was missing. Claims regarding a reduction in 
the use of healthcare services such as NMOSD-related hospitalisations were made; however, no 
information was provided on NMOSD-related hospitalisations under satralizumab treatment to 
ascertain the existence of these supposed beneficial outcomes for the patients which would further 
support the claim of major contribution to patient care. 
Further to the above, the COMP considered that it could not recommend maintaining the orphan 
designation.

5.  COMP position adopted on 20 December 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.4 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to neurological impairment such as 
paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-year mortality; 
although a satisfactory method for the treatment of the condition has been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Uplizna may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition does not hold, since the sponsor could not establish the existence 
of a clinically relevant advantage over the authorised satisfactory method of treatment. In addition, 
although the sponsor claimed that their product could offer a major contribution to patient care 
through a different dosing schedule and route of administration, insufficient and inconclusive data 
has been submitted to support this claim versus the currently authorised satisfactory method of 
treatment.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Uplizna, inebilizumab for 
treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (EU/3/17/1856) is removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

6.  Appeal to the negative opinion adopted on 20 December 
2021 
Grounds for appeal 
The sponsor presented detailed grounds for appeal (EMA/OD/0000079956) on 1 February 2022.  
Please refer to the sponsor’s appeal documents in the case Input from Industry folder. 
The detailed grounds for appeal were further addressed by the sponsor at an oral explanation before 
the COMP on 16 February 2022. 
Comments on the grounds of appeal 
The sponsor challenged the COMP’s position on significant benefit linked to the sponsor’s claim of a 
clinically relevant advantage due to improved efficacy; and linked to the sponsor claim of major 
contribution to patient care.  
In their grounds for appeal the sponsor aimed to address the main issues which led to the negative 
opinion. As a general note, the sponsor has provided mainly new data/analyses in support of 
establishing significant benefit based on improved efficacy of Uplizna (inebilizumab) vs Enspryng 
(satralizumab). The sponsor provided indirect comparative efficacy analyses on the time to first attack 
(primary efficacy endpoint), attack-free rates and impact on disability accumulation. The sponsor 
states to have taken into consideration relevant and possible adjustments to match trial populations. 
The sponsor noted that it had examined all publicly available data sources of Enspryng (satrilizumab) 
in order to prepare these comparisons. 
The sponsor provided details of patients’ baseline and disease characteristics and emphasized that the 
study populations, enrolment criteria, and trial designs are overall comparable between the pivotal 
randomized placebo-controlled monotherapy trials N-MOmentum (inebilizumab) and SAkuraStar 
(satralizumab). Both studies used time to first attack as a primary endpoint and enrolled patients with 
a similar level of baseline disease severity, including the mean or median age of first attack, 
annualised attack rate, and mean or median EDSS. One marked difference between the two studies, 
however, was the different duration of their respective randomised-controlled periods (RCP). To 
capture the number of events needed to show statistical significance, considerably more patients were 
randomised in N-MOmentum (N=213, AQP4+; 93% of total trial population) to permit a shorter 
placebo exposure period with an RCP of 6 months, while fewer patients were randomised in 
SAkuraStar (N=64, AQP4+; 67% of total trial population) with a longer placebo exposure period and 
an RCP of 18 months.  
Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) for the primary efficacy endpoint of time to 
first attack 
For the purpose of the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), for the primary efficacy 
endpoint of time to first attack, the sponsor describes to have used a Cox regression analysis which 
identified 3 variables (sex, race, and region) as statistically significantly different (p < 0.05) between 
the two AQP4+ study populations. These factors were the basis for the MAIC adjustments. It is noted 
that the comparison of rates between two populations, as done by the sponsor, corresponds to the 
results from a Chi-squared test. The sponsor concludes that the efficacy benefit observed with 
inebilizumab versus satralizumab is substantial, after conducting the MAIC, with an estimated hazard 
ratio (HR) of 0.67. While the COMP acknowledged the positive trend of this point estimate, they 
emphasised that the 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.237, 3.170) covers 1, i.e. “no difference”, with

an upper limit of above 3. This implies a great level of uncertainty for this estimate, meaning that it 
cannot be excluded that inebilizumab and satralizumab are not different with regard to preventing 
attacks, or that inebilizumab may even be inferior to satralizumab in this regard.  
During the COMP plenary, the sponsor was invited to elaborate on the claimed improved efficacy of 
ineblizumab over satralizumab in terms of an absolute risk reduction of having an attack. It was 
pointed out by the sponsor that the difference between the adjusted HRs from the Cox Proportional 
Hazards Model was 0.1 (0.086). However, it is noted by COMP that results from a Cox Proportional 
Hazards Model don’t allow drawing conclusions about an absolute risk reduction; in particular, a 
difference between two HRs cannot be interpreted as absolute risk reduction. 
A further (separate) limitation in the interpretation of this estimate is the different durations of the 
randomized controlled phases (RCP) of the N-MOmentum and SAkuraStar trials, i.e. 6 months vs. 18 
months. Considering that NMO does not have linear disease activity but cluster activity, the 
significantly different durations of the randomized- placebo controlled phases may constitute a bias in 
the analysis of attack-rate. The COMP would have liked to see hazard ratios for different periods on the 
SAkuraStar trial, e.g. in particular after 6 months, which were however not available. The sponsor 
emphasized that the estimates are HRs from a Cox Proportional Hazards Model which assumes 
proportional hazards over time and that there are no grounds to believe that the treatment effect will 
change over time for Ineblizumab or Satralizumab.

Additional sensitivity analyses were provided by the sponsor which adjusted for additional sets of 
parameters in the comparison of the respective AQP4+ populations of the N-MOmentum and 
SAkuraStar trials, i.e. region + sex: HR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.235-3.203); race + sex: HR of 0.77 (95% 
CI 0.273-2.754); prior attacks + region + sex: HR of 0.674 (95% CI 0.227-3.309); and prior attacks + 
race + sex: HR of 0.796 (95% CI 0.270-2.780). These additional sensitivity analyses, with regard to a 
comparative reduction in attack-rate, are consistent with the point estimate from the primary MAIC. 
They suggest a positive trend for inebilizumab to reduce the attack-rate but are still associated with 
substantial uncertainty. Again, the upper value of the 95% CI contains values far exceeding 1, 
indicating that the treatment effect for inebilizumab could also be similar or inferior to satralizumab.  
In addition, the sponsor provided Kaplan-Meier analyses of attack-free rates. Considering that NMOSD 
is a life-long condition, the COMP was especially interested in the analysis for the 192-week timepoint. 
The analysis compared any patient that received inebilizumab to any patient that received 
satralizumab over time within the NMOmentum and SAkuraStar- trials. At Week 192, inebilizumab had 
an estimated 78% risk reduction in relapse while satralizumab had an estimated 73% risk reduction of 
relapse. However, while both trials were RCTs, the calibration against control is lost for the comparison 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

at week 192 due to the fact that both studies permitted the placebo patients to cross-over to active 
drug during the RCP after a protocol defined attack (treated + control patients who crossed over). In 
addition, no CIs were available for satralizumab for this time point.  
Apart from methodological uncertainties and concerns over the proposed point estimates being true 
values, the COMP also pointed out that the clinical relevance of a putative 5% lower risk for relapse 
has not been contextualized sufficiently by the sponsor and their experts, for the respective target 
populations. The question on a clinically relevant advantage between different products becomes 
considerably more complex when both products have reasonably good efficacy and a possible 
additional gain in efficacy with one product would, at best, be modest.  
Considering all the above, a positive conclusion on improved efficacy and a clinically relevant 
advantage of Uplizna over Enspryng could not be drawn. 
Disability impact 
The sponsor now presents data from a continuous analysis (instead of the EMA preferred categorical 
analysis for which no data is available for satralizumab) of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 
and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to permit comparison of inebilizumab with satralizumab in terms of 
disability status / dependence in the daily activities. Because results are not available for satralizumab 
in the AQP4+ population, the comparison was conducted on the 1) unadjusted ITT populations and 2) 
adjusted ITT population (i.e. NMOmentum ITT population being MAIC adjusted to the AQP4 Status of 
SAkuraStar to reflect similar ITT populations). As a reminder, in N-MOmentum AQP4+ patients 
accounted for 93% of the ITT population vs only 67% of the SAkuraStar ITT population.  
The continuous analysis reveals inebilizumab was associated with greater numerical benefit on both 
EDSS and mRS measures (analysis with unadjusted ITT Population*). After adjusting for AQP4+ 
status, satralizumab was associated with a numerical benefit on EDSS but the numerical worsening on 
mRS remained in comparison with an improvement in the inebilizumab treated population:

Overall, the COMP considers that these comparative analyses show a somewhat mixed picture 
(depending on adjustment factors and EDSS vs mRS scales). Furthermore, the observation time of 28

weeks was considered very limited to allow meaningful conclusions on relative disability impact. 
Furthermore, and linked to the prior point, also the relative changes in the scores were very small and 
their relative translations into clinical relevant effects were not clear to the COMP. Study populations of 
the NMOmentum and SAkuraStar trials were overall at rather early disease stages and disability in 
NMO is directly linked to the attacks, as compared to other diseases such as multiple sclerosis where 
disability progresses also independently of attacks. 
Patient care 
No new relevant data has been presented by the sponsor on this aspect. 
The patient representative attending the oral hearing pointed out that in general hospital 
administration of the NMOSD medicine would rather be preferable than home self-administration, 
mainly due to the fact that this may allow for a more frequent access to their respective health care 
professional. The patient representative pointed out that she only gets appointments with her 
neurologist about once a year to review her health status which she considered being too infrequent. 
Furthermore, the patient representative noted that there could be a potential advantage in taking a 
drug which does not require such frequent safety monitoring, as is the case for Enspryng, at least 
within the first year. 
The COMP acknowledged these points but emphasized the lack of relevant and conclusive data in 
support of a claim of major contribution to patient care. The claim of a supposed self-evident 
significant benefit of a product with a less frequent administration by a health care professional and 
less safety monitoring as compared to authorized products was not considered acceptable by the 
COMP, as this assumption was not supported by any data showing meaningful benefits for patients. 
In general, the observations of the sponsor in connection to the claim of major contribution to patient 
care (e.g., in connection to dosing and adherence; reduced hospitalisations; avoidance of CYP-related 
drug-drug interactions) were not supported by any data demonstrating clinical benefits for patients.  
Conclusion  
In conclusion, the additional analyses do not alter the COMP’s position in that the assumption that 
Uplizna may be of significant benefit over Enspryng does not hold.    
While the COMP acknowledged the positive trend in the attack-rate from the MAIC, the level of 
uncertainty over this estimate being a true value of the estimand of the increased efficacy of 
inebilizumab over satralizumab, was considered too high.  
With regard to the disability impact, the COMP considers that the comparative analyses provided by 
the sponsor do not allow a clear conclusion.  
With regards to the claim of improved patient care, the COMP acknowledged the points made by the 
patient representative but emphasized the lack of relevant and conclusive data in support of a claim of 
major contribution to patient care.

7. COMP final position on review of criteria for orphan 
designation adopted on 3 March 2022 
Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  detailed  grounds  for  appeal  and  the  explanations  presented  by  the 
sponsor during the oral explanation, the COMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.4 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to neurological impairment such as 
paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-year mortality; 
in the context of the first opinion, the COMP accepted that no comparison was required between 
Uplizna and Soliris for the purpose of the maintenance of the orphan designation of Uplizna, as 
Soliris is not authorised for all patients for which Uplizna is intended. However, a comparison was 
required between Uplizna and Enspryng, as the two products are intended for a similar adult 
patient population. In the context of this comparison, the sponsor sought to establish the existence 
of a significant benefit of Uplizna over Enspryng on the basis of two (alternative) claims; first, on 
the basis of the claim of a clinically relevant advantage of Uplizna over Enspryng; second, on the 
basis of the claim that Uplizna amounts to a major contribution to patient care. These claims were 
not accepted due to the lack of conclusive evidence in support of those claims; 
in the context of the appeal, the sponsor presented additional evidence and/or arguments to the 
COMP to further substantiate the claims of clinically relevant advantage and of major contribution 
to patient care;   
the additional indirect comparisons of two different placebo-controlled trials submitted by the 
sponsor in the context of the appeal, in support of the claim of a clinically relevant advantage of 
Uplizna over Enspryng, were associated with substantial methodological uncertainties. In 
particular, the point estimate of the hazard ratio comparing Uplizna versus Enspryng for time to 
first attack favored Uplizna. However, the corresponding 95% confidence interval indicated large 
uncertainty, and this means that it could not be excluded that the efficacy of Uplizna is similar or 
inferior to that of Enspryng. Furthermore, the sponsor was not able to reliably establish clinical 
relevance of the numerical difference, which was considered small in the setting of an indirect 
comparison. On account of the lack of conclusive evidence in support of the claim of a clinically 
relevant advantage, the COMP concluded that this claim could not be established;  
the additional arguments submitted by the sponsor in the context of the appeal, in support of the 
claim of major contribution to patient care, did not contain any data demonstrating the existence 
of clinical benefits for patients taking Uplizna (as opposed to Enspryng). On account of the lack of 
further data in support of the claim of a major contribution to patient care, the COMP concluded 
that this claim could not be established; 
therefore, the COMP considered that the submitted evidence and/or arguments in the context of 
the appeal did not suffice to establish that Uplizna provides a significant benefit over Enspryng.  
The  COMP,  having  considered  the  detailed  grounds  for  appeal  submitted  by  the  sponsor  and  all  the 
supporting data on the basis of Article 5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMADOC-1700519818-787447  
Page 16/17 
 
 
 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The COMP recommends that Uplizna, inebilizumab, for treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorders (EU/3/17/1856) is removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

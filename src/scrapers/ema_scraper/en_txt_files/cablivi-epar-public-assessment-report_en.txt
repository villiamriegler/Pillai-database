1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Ablynx NV submitted on 3 February 2017 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Cablivi, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 1 April 2016. 
Cablivi was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/09/629 on 30 April 2009 in the following 
condition: treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
‘Cablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP).’ 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Cablivi as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment 
reports. (http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=/pages/medicines/human/medicine

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Acquired TTP is a life-threatening, autoimmune blood clotting disorder manifested by microvascular 
occlusions and consequent thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, and organ ischemia. It is a rare 
disease with an incidence of 1.2 to 11 cases per million per year (Miller et al., 2004, Terrell et al., 
2005, Reese et al., 2013, Kremer Hovinga et al., 2017). In the EU, the annual incidence of aTTP has 
been reported to be between 1.5 and 6 cases per million per year (Miller et al., 2004, Scully et al., 
2008, Hassan et al., 2015, Veyradier et al., 2015).  The incidence in children (<18 years) is much 
lower, about 3% of that in adults (Reese et al., 2013). 
aTTP generally occurs in adulthood and is more common in women (2:1 vs men) and people of African 
descent. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 40 years.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Acquired TTP is caused by inhibitory autoantibodies to ADAMTS13, resulting in a severe deficiency in 
this vWF-cleaving protease. Decreased ADAMTS13 activity leads to an accumulation of ULvWF 
multimers which bind to platelets and induce adhesion. The consumption of platelets into these 
microthrombi causes severe thrombocytopenia, tissue ischemia and organ dysfunction, commonly 
involving the brain, heart, and kidneys, and resulting in acute thromboembolic events such as stroke, 
myocardial infarction, and venous thrombosis, and in early death. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
With current treatment, episodes of aTTP have been reported to be associated with an acute mortality 
of up to 20%. Most deaths occur within 30 days of diagnosis and a median time to death of 9 days. 
Refractoriness to therapy (defined as a lack of improvement of the thrombocytopenia after 7 days of 
standard treatment, or as a failure of platelet count doubling after 4 days of standard therapy together 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 8/88 
 
 
  
 
 
 
with elevated LDH levels) has been identified as an indicator of a poor prognosis for survival. The 
incidence of refractoriness is approximately 17% and is associated with a mortality rate reported to be 
as high as 42%. 
In addition to the acute risks of the disease, patients experiencing an episode of aTTP may suffer long-
term consequences such as cognitive deficits, depression, and arterial hypertension, and are at risk for 
recurrence. The reported recurrence rate ranges from 10-84%. Recurrences typically occur within 1-2 
years but have been reported up to 30 years after the initial episode. 
2.1.5.  Management 
A combination of plasma exchange (PE) and immunosuppressants (corticosteroids and increasingly 
also rituximab) is the mainstay of treatment. Currently no products have been authorised for the 
treatment of aTTP worldwide. 
Plasma exchange, in which a patient’s blood plasma is removed through apheresis and is replaced with 
donor plasma, removes ULvWF and the circulating autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenishes 
blood levels of the enzyme. Plasma exchange should be started within 24 hours of presentation, as 
delay decreases the chance of response. Prior to the introduction of PE treatment, TTP was associated 
with extremely high mortality (~90%). Although PE has substantially improved survival, in spite of 
greater understanding of disease pathogenesis and the use of newer immunosuppressants, the 
mortality rate has not been further impacted. 
Though considered a relatively safe procedure, in acutely ill patients such as those with aTTP, PE is 
often associated with major complications which may be related to the central venous catheter (e.g. 
infection, thrombosis, catheter insertion complications) or be plasma related (e.g. allergic reactions, 
alkalosis, volume depletion complications, infection). According to the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry, 
24% of patients receiving PE followed between 1996-2011 experienced major PE related complications. 
Of note, a greater frequency of major PE related complications is observed among patients with 
ADAMTS13 activity of less than 10%, which may be related to a greater number of days that PE 
treatment is required. Therefore, treatment options that result in a reduction in the days and volume 
of PE would offer a clear advantage from a safety perspective.  
Glucocorticoids are often administered as adjunct to PE in the initial treatment of aTTP and are 
maintained for a period of 1-2 weeks after its discontinuation. The use of corticosteroids is based on 
historical evidence that some patients with limited symptoms might respond to corticosteroids alone. 
There have been no studies specifically comparing the combination of PE with corticosteroids, versus 
PE alone. 
Other immunosuppressive agents such as rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that targets B-
cell populations and reduces formation of inhibitory autoantibodies to ADAMTS13, are increasingly used 
as these are considered to address the underlying autoimmune process. Nevertheless, a limitation of 
rituximab treatment is its delayed onset of effect, with at least 3-7 days needed to achieve adequate 
B-cell depletion, and even longer to restore ADAMTS13 activity levels. In an acute disease setting, 
where immediate and effective intervention may be critical for survival and prevention of short term 
and long term damage, a rapidly acting medicine that offers immediate protection is needed.  
Close monitoring of clinical symptoms and regular measurement of platelet counts guide the duration 
and intensity of PE and immunosuppression. Success of therapy is defined by platelet counts 
≥150×109/L persisting over 48 hours. This is normally accompanied by at least partial recovery of 
ADAMTS13 activity. 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 9/88 
 
 
  
 
 
Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency of <10% has been recognised as a biomarker in the acute and long-term 
management of patients with aTTP. During an acute episode, low ADAMTS13 activity levels may guide 
the intensity or duration of PE and the dose and type of immunosuppressants used. Patients 
experiencing severe ADAMTS13 deficiency of <10% during remission are at a 3-fold increased risk of 
recurrent disease compared to patients without such a deficiency. By using ADAMTS13 activity data to 
tailor therapy for these patients (e.g., pre-emptive use of rituximab), recurrence may be reduced.  
The current standard of care treatment does not address the pathophysiological platelet adhesion 
leading to the formation of microthrombi. Other limitations are slow onset of efficacy and lack of 
efficacy in refractory patients. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for rapid-onset 
therapies directly inhibiting the formation of microthrombi and tissue ischemia.  
About the product 
Caplacizumab is a humanised bivalent Nanobody that consists of two identical, genetically linked, 
humanised building blocks targeting the A1-domain of von Willebrand factor and inhibiting the 
interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets. As such, caplacizumab prevents the ultralarge 
von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion, which is characteristic of aTTP. It also affects the 
disposition of von Willebrand factor, leading to transient reductions of total von Willebrand factor 
antigen levels and to concomitant reduction of factor VIII:C levels during treatment. 
Based on its mode of action, caplacizumab presents an increased risk for mucocutaneous bleeding and 
potential prolonged bleeding after surgical interventions. 
The first dose of Caplacizumab should be given as an intravenous injection of 10 mg prior to plasma 
exchange.  
The subsequent doses should be given daily with a subcutaneous administration of 10 mg of 
caplacizumab after completion of each plasma exchange for the duration of daily plasma exchange 
treatment, followed by daily subcutaneous injection of 10 mg of caplacizumab for 30 days after 
stopping daily plasma exchange treatment. 
If at the end of this period there is evidence of unresolved immunological disease, it is recommended 
to optimise the immunosuppression regimen and continue daily subcutaneous administration of 10 mg 
of caplacizumab until the signs of underlying immunological disease are resolved (e.g. sustained 
normalisation of ADAMTS13 activity level). 
In the clinical development program, caplacizumab has been administered daily for up to 65 days. No 
data on re-treatment with caplacizumab are available.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Caplacizumab is a humanised bivalent Nanobody consisting of two identical building blocks joined by a 
tri-alanine linker. Nanobodies represent a novel therapeutic class of proteins derived from the heavy 
chain variable domains that occur naturally in heavy chain immunoglobulins from Camelidae. 
Caplacizumab is produced in E. coli. 
Cablivi is presented as follows: 
• 
Lyophilised powder: vial containing the active substance (strength 10 mg) formulated with 
sucrose, polysorbate 80, citric acid anhydrous and trisodium citrate dihydrate (pH 6.5); 
Assessment Report

Page 10/88 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Solvent: pre-filled syringe containing water for injections. 
Cablivi is administered by intravenous and subcutaneous injection and is for single use only. Cablivi is 
supplied with 1 vial with the powder, 1 pre-filled syringe with the solvent, 1 vial adapter, 1 hypodermic 
needle and 2 alcohol swabs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Caplacizumab consists of 259 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 27876 Dalton. A schematic 
representation is shown in Figure 1.

The amino acid sequence of ALX-0081 is provided in Figure 2. 
Figure 2: Amino acid sequence of ALX-0081 
Caplacizumab binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a key protein in haemostasis, 
and specifically interferes with the interaction of vWF with platelets. Caplacizumab is able to interact 
with vWF in both its active and inactive form, thereby preventing vWF-mediated platelet adhesion. The 
biological activity of caplacizumab is assessed using a Biacore potency assay to quantify binding of 
caplacizumab to vWF. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Information about the facilities for manufacturing, storage and control of active substance has been 
provided in the dossier. GMP compliance has been demonstrated for all manufacturers. 
The caplacizumab active substance is produced in Richter-Helm BioLogics (RHB), Germany (RHB), 
Dengelsberg, 24796 Bovenau, Germany. Caplacizumab active substance is expressed in E. coli. One 
vial of the working cell bank (WCB) is thawed and the cell culture is expanded in a seed fermentor. The 
expanded inoculum is transferred to a production fermentor. Expression of protein caplacizumab is 
induced. The harvest is clarified by tangential flow filtration (TFF) and dead-end filtration.  
The purification process includes chromatographic capture, intermediate purification and polish steps 
followed by ultrafiltration (UF) and diafiltration (DF) steps. The purified material is then pooled and 
formulated followed by bioburden reduction filtration and filling. Caplacizumab active substance is 
shipped to the manufacturing site for finished product. 
Caplacizumab active substance is stored in sterile bags. A certificate of analysis for the bags 
demonstrates the specification criteria (including cytotoxicity test, physiochemical test, biological 
reactivity test). A certificate of irradiation has also been provided. Compatibility of the container is 
evaluated in the stability section.

Validation of the caplacizumab active substance process was performed using consecutive commercial-
scale batches manufactured at RHB. Similar to the process description, the validation of the upstream 
process is described with a large amount of detail and data, being considered acceptable. There were 
some deviations in the upstream part of the validation runs. These are described and justified by the 
Applicant. 
The downstream process validation was, similar to the upstream process validation, presented with a 
full data set of parameters and outputs. Profiles of chromatograms have been provided. 
Clearance of process-related impurities, product-related impurities and product–related substances has 
been demonstrated, both graphically and in tabular form. The clearance of impurities is agreed upon. 
Manufacturing process development 
Three processes have been used during the development history of caplacizumab. Details about 
process differences, justification for making the changes, and results from comparability programs are 
provided. Batch release data, with corresponding acceptance criteria are provided in tabular form and 
compared for the different processes.  
The major changes implemented in the final manufacturing process was the shift from MCB to WCB, 
removal of selective pressure, change in harvest technology and finally a change of formulation buffer 
and caplacizumab concentration to allow for production of a lyophilised finished product. The extended 
comparability program demonstrated some differences between processes; however, overall, 
comparability was demonstrated. 
Qualification of small scale models have been presented in the dossier. The results are in general 
comparable, concluding that the small scale models are representative of the large scale 
manufacturing process. A few differences are described and justified. This is considered acceptable. 
Characterisation of the upstream process was conducted using a design of experiment (DoE) set up. 
Although some of the investigated parameters were shown to influence caplacizumab product yield and 
quality, the evaluated ranges still resulted in acceptable caplacizumab quality. 
Characterisation of the downstream process has been summarised in the dossier and further presented 
with a high degree of detail in four step reports.  
Characterisation 
Caplacizumab is a humanised bivalent nanobody consisting of two identical building blocks, each with 
one canonical disulfide bridge, joined by a tri-alanine linker. Caplacizumab binds to the A1 domain of 
von Willebrand Factor (vWF).The biological activity of caplacizumab is assessed using a Biacore 
potency assay to quantify binding of caplacizumab to vWF.  
An extensive list of analytical methods has been applied for structural and biological characterisation of 
caplacizumab. The majority of the characterisation has been performed on the current master and 
working standards. However, additional engineering, clinical phase III and process performance 
qualification (PPQ) batches have also been used in several characterisation evaluations.  
In general, the methods chosen and the results provided demonstrate that caplacizumab has been well 
characterised.  
Three different assays were evaluated to investigate the biological activity. A fourth assay was used to 
determine the affinity of caplacizumab to human multimeric vWF. These methods are considered 
appropriate and reflect the mode of action.

A broad characterisation program has been performed for caplacizumab impurities, using several 
analytical methods in parallel during characterization of each impurity. Forced degradation studies 
have been executed and data both in tabular and graphical form has been provided. Furthermore, a 
potential loss of caplacizumab potency under stressed or accelerated conditions or during force 
degradation studies has been evaluated, in relation to each impurity. 
The most pronounced product-related variants for caplacizumab are amino acid isomerisation, 
pyroglutamate, methionine oxidation and incorporation of norleucine. The product-related variants 
have been acceptably characterised.  
Process-related impurities include host cell proteins (HCPs), DNA, endotoxins, polypropylene glycol 
(PPG), IPTG, glycine, antibiotics and elemental impurities. Process-related impurities controlled during 
release testing include residual HCPs, DNA and endotoxins. 
Adequate clearance of process-related impurities has been validated during process validation. In 
addition, small-scale characterisation studies have demonstrated that both the intermediate and polish 
step have additional capacity to remove DNA and endotoxins. 
Specification  
The specification of the caplacizumab active substance includes control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests. 
The proposed specification has been adequately justified and is considered acceptable. The major 
degradation products (product-related substances and impurities), noted during the stability studies, 
are tested within the active substance release specification.  
The Applicant has justified the use of a single potency method claiming its overall superior analytic 
performance and its ability to identify stress-induced product-related variants compared to other 
methods. 
The Applicant has justified the specification limits based on both active substance and finished product 
batches, from clinical and engineering batches. Finished product batches from the completed phase III 
study Hercules, in addition to several other (non-clinical) batches using the commercial manufacturing 
process are included. Results from non-clinical batches are considered as supportive. Nevertheless, the 
proposed specifications are all acceptable as the limits proposed are in line with the data from clinical 
phase III batches. 
The proposed acceptance criteria for pH, osmolality, protein concentration, HCP, host cell DNA and 
endotoxins are acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods used for testing of the active substance are described in the dossier. At large, 
analytical methods are well described and their suitability proven using method validation according to 
ICH. In all validation studies, formulation buffers have been used to demonstrate that the formulations 
do not interfere with the results.  
Potency and identity are determined by a method measuring the binding capacity to immobilised 
human von Willebrand Factor A1 domain (vWF-A1. The potency of a sample is expressed as 
percentage relative to an appropriate reference.  
Batch analysis 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018

Batch release analysis results from three GMP batches (used during PPQ, stability studies and clinical 
phase III studies) have been provided. Batch release data from several other historical batches 
manufactured with previous process versions are provided in the dossier. The results are comparable 
and acceptable. 
Reference materials 
A two tiered approach is used. The current master reference standard is lyophilised and used to assess 
stability of the working reference standard (WRS) and to bridge from one WRS to the next. The current 
liquid WRS is used in routine tests.  
Future WRSs are tested according to a protocol containing predefined qualification criteria. 
Furthermore, a qualification plan for future master reference standards has been provided, including 
information about the potency calibration approach.  
Stability 
Stability data from three representative caplacizumab batches stored for ≥36 months are presented. All 
three batches remained within the current acceptance criteria up to 36 months. No significant changes 
or trends have been observed.  
A shelf life of 36 months when stored at long-term conditions is acceptable for the active substance.In 
accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Composition 
The Cablivi finished product is supplied as powder and solvent for solution for injection: 
• 
Powder: Type I glass vial with a stopper (butyl rubber), a seal (polypropylene) and a cap 
(polypropylene), containing 10 mg of caplacizumab. 
•  Solvent: Pre-filled syringe (type I glass cartridge closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper) with 1 
mL of water for injections used for reconstitution.  
All container closure materials comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. 
The pack size contains: 
- 1 vial with powder 
- 1 pre-filled syringe with solvent 
- 1 vial adapter  
- 1 hypodermic needle (30 gauge) 
- 2 alcohol swabs 
The composition of Cablivi consists of a 20 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.5), 7.0% sucrose (w/v) and 0.01% 
polysorbate 80 (v/v). The excipients are commonly used in the formulation of biopharmaceuticals.  
The finished product is reconstituted with 1 mL WFI to allow for administration of 10 mg of 
caplacizumab. This takes into account a potential loss of active substance during reconstitution and

injection. This is found acceptable since an overfill is always necessary in order to be able to guarantee 
administration of the nominal dose.  
For both intravenous and subcutaneous administration, the powder contained in the vial should be 
reconstituted using the vial adapter and all solvent in the pre-filled syringe. The solvent should be 
added slowly and mixed gently to avoid foaming of the solution. The vial with connected syringe should 
be allowed to stand on a surface for 5 minutes at room temperature. 
The reconstituted solution is clear, colourless, or slightly yellowish. It must be visually inspected for 
particulate matter. A solution exhibiting particulates should not be used.  
The entire volume of the reconstituted solution should be transferred back to the glass syringe and the 
entire volume of the syringe should be immediately administered.  
Cablivi is for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.  
The Applicant provided declarations of conformity for the devices. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The development of the lyophilised formulation is thoroughly described in the dossier. This formulation 
is used in the finished product process used for manufacture of clinical trial and future commercial 
supply. 
The development of the manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. The development of the 
control strategy is well explained and acceptably justified. The commercial finished product 
manufacturing process is a lyophilisation of 1 mL of active substance solution. It does not contain any 
additional compounding steps. The design and development of the lyophilisation process have been 
satisfactorily described with a sufficient degree of detail for all steps in the lyophilisation cycle.  
The Applicant is currently performing a dedicated extractable and leachable study on Cablivi finished 
product in its primary container closure system. The Applicant is recommended to provide the results 
of this study when available.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture of the lyophilised finished product 
The Cablivi finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing and dispensing, pooling and 
mixing, pre-filtration and sterile filtration of caplacizumab bulk active substance, followed by filling, 
partial stoppering, lyophilisation, stoppering, crimping of glass vials, visual inspection, pack-off and 
storage. There are no declared hold points, but the product is held at various points for normal 
processing, and no reprocessing is permitted during the Cablivi finished product manufacturing 
process. Active substance batches can be pooled for the manufacture of one batch of the finished 
product. 
The batch numbering system has been described. 
Process validation 
Process validation studies are based on a traditional approach and are performed using consecutive 
commercial-scale batches. All validation batches complied with the established in-process and release 
specifications, no critical deviations were observed.  
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018

The maximum processing time from start of pooling to start of lyophilisation has been covered in the 
process validation.  
The aseptic filling has been sufficiently validated with media fills covering the maximum duration of 
filling.  
The capability of the sterilising filter to reduce bioburden under worst case load conditions was shown 
by means of a bioburden challenge test by the filter vendor according to the vendor’s protocol and 
corresponding report. The freeze-drying step has been sufficiently validated, in-process testing on 
samples from different positions at the shelves show a homogenous residual moisture level supporting 
the performance of both freeze dryers at the proposed batch size range. Shipping validation of final 
product from the finished product manufacturing site to the storage facility has also been acceptably 
performed.  
Product specification 
A) Cablivi finished product 
The specification of the caplacizumab finished product includes control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests. 
Analytical methods for Cablivi finished product 
All analytical methods used for testing of the finished product are described in the dossier. Many test 
methods used for release testing and stability testing of the finished product are the same as those 
used for release testing and stability testing of the active substance. Additional method validation for 
finished product testing is not required given that the formulation of the reconstituted finished product 
is representative of that of active substance. 
Batch analysis for Cablivi finished product 
The batch analysis data presented for the PPQ batches complies with the limits in the proposed finished 
product specification except for protein content. For future batches, protein content (mg) will be 
included for release instead of protein concentration (mg/mL), which is supported by dose uniformity 
testing.  
Justification of specifications for Cablivi finished product 
For many tests the same acceptance criteria are proposed for finished product and active substance 
and these are justified in the same way in the dossier.  
B) Water for injections 
The specification and methods currently in place for testing WFI pre-filled syringes are presented in the 
dossier, and comprises testing for appearance, conductivity, acidity/alkalinity, chlorides, nitrates, 
sulphates, ammonium, calcium and magnesium, particulate matter, extractable volume, bacterial 
endotoxins and sterility. The testing program has been designed to fully comply with the current ICH 
Pharmacopoeias. For the tests following the same test principle and required by more than one 
Pharmacopoeia, a scientific assessment was made in order to determine according to which 
Pharmacopoeia the test should be carried out. The rationale for test selection was in all cases the more 
rigorous test parameter(s) or acceptance criteria. In cases where such a scientifically based alignment 
was not achievable (e.g. due to a different test principle), all tests are carried out as required by the 
Pharmacopoeias. 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 18/88 
 
 
  
 
 
The specification has been justified. 
Batch analysis data is provided for the validation batches. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 48 months when stored at 2-8 ºC is proposed. It is also claimed that Cablivi may be 
stored at a temperature not above 25°C for a single period of up to 2 months, but not beyond the 
expiry date and Cablivi should not be returned to refrigerated storage after storage at room 
temperature. 
An overview of the stability studies, conducted in line with ICH, is presented in the dossier, indicating 
currently available data. The study is on-going for up to 60 months.  Stability data up to 60 months is 
available for one GMP-batch of finished product and for two non-GMP batches at long-term conditions. 
Stability data up to 24 months is also available for one additional GMP batch at the long-term storage 
condition.  
At long term storage, all test parameters remained within the specification limits and no significant 
changes were observed for any of the parameters tested for up to 60 months storage at 2-8 ºC. During 
accelerated and stressed storage, the formation of a product-related substance and increase of the 
moisture content are the main changes observed.  
An initial reconstitution study was performed for 24 h at 25°C supporting storage in a polypropylene-
based syringe and expulsion through a 30 G needle. In addition, an in-use stability study was 
performed with the provided kit components, demonstrating that storage of reconstituted Cablivi in the 
syringes for 24 h at 25°C and 40°C did not influence the quality of the material. The chemical and 
physical in-use stability of 4 h at 25°C, stated in the SmPC, is found acceptably justified. 
Furthermore, in-use stability data support that the reconstituted product can be administered via a 
venous catheter in combination with commonly used perfusion lines and flush solutions.  
Photostability studies were conducted and the results presented. Cablivi should be stored in the 
original package in order to protect from light. 
The data presented support the proposed shelf-life of 48 months at 2-8°C as well as storage of the 
non-reconstituted product at a temperature not above 25°C for a single period of up to 2 months.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Comparability exercise for the finished product 
The formulation of both active substance and finished product was changed from a phosphate to a 
citrate based buffer, combined with the change of the finished product presentation from a solution to 
a lyophilised powder. Additionally, the concentration of active substance and reconstituted finished 
product is higher compared to previous process versions.  
It is claimed that the results of the analytical comparability assessment overall support the 
comparability and/or improvement of the commercial process as compared to previous process. 
However, similar to the active substance some differences were observed between processes. 
Nevertheless, despite this minor difference comparability has been acceptably demonstrated.  
Adventitious agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 19/88 
 
 
  
 
 
Microbial adventitious agents are controlled throughout the manufacture of caplacizumab active 
substance and finished product. 
In accordance with the current version of the CHMP guideline "Note for guidance on minimizing the risk 
of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal 
products" (EMEA/410/01), raw materials, product contact materials and excipients which present no 
BSE/TSE risk are used for the manufacturing of Only raw materials and excipients certified as of non-
animal origin are used for manufacture of caplacizumab active substance and finished product, except 
IPTG, which uses lactose as a starting material. Lactose is isolated from bovine milk, subsequently 
transformed into galactose, and further into IPTG by a multistep chemical synthesis process, i.e. it is 
not derived from milk directly. According to EMEA/410/01 Rev. 2, milk and milk-derived products 
including lactose and galactose are unlikely to present any risk of BSE/TSE transmission. 
A declaration of origin and TSE statement of the IPTG supplier was provided. 
In addition, TSE statements of the caplacizumab drug substance manufacturer are provided in the 
dossier. 
Viral adventitious agents 
The host cell caplacizumab MCB and WCB used for the manufacture of caplacizumab active substance 
is an E. coli derivative. Based on the microbial nature of the manufacturing process and the materials 
used therein, the risk for viral contamination of caplacizumab can be excluded and the product is 
considered not to fall within the scope of ICH Q5A guideline on “Viral Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin”.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Applicant provided a well-structured quality dossier resulting in a limited numbers of issues being 
raised and no Major Objection. All the issues have been resolved.  
Active substance  
The cell bank system is properly tested and qualified. The active substance manufacturing process is 
described in sufficient details. CPPs are identified and the active substance manufacturing process is 
appropriately validated.  
Extended characterisation of caplacizumab has been performed. Multiple orthogonal analytical methods 
have been applied to assess caplacizumab molecular properties, such as primary structure, post-
translational modifications, higher order structure, and biological activity.  
The approach for setting active substance and finished product specification limits for potency, purity 
and product-related impurities was initially not agreed upon. The specifications were set based on a 
central value from a single finished product batch from a previous process version. The revised 
calculations for justification of specification limits for potency, purity, product related substances and 
product-related impurities, based on previous and current process batches are found acceptable.  
Data submitted supports a shelf life of 36 months when stored at long-term conditions. 
Finished product 
The pharmaceutical development is found comprehensive and acceptably addressed. The control 
strategy, manufacturing process and the controls of critical steps are sufficiently described. 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 20/88 
 
 
  
 
 
Data presented support the proposed shelf-life of 48 months at 2-8°C as well as storage at a 
temperature not above 25°C for a single period of up to 2 months.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Cablivi is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The cell culture and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Cablivi is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended a point for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The non-clinical pharmacological activity of caplacizumab was assessed using in vitro and ex vivo 
binding and potency assays as well as in a diseased-like model in baboons in vivo. 
In vitro 
Caplacizumab is a bivalent humanised Nanobody directed against the A1 domain of vWF. Binding of 
caplacizumab to the A1 domain of vWF inhibits interaction between vWF and the platelet GPIb-IX-V 
receptor. This neutralisation of vWF activity can be observed as a pharmacodynamic (PD) response by 
measuring a decrease in ristocetin cofactor activity (RICO PD assay). Target mediated disposition is 
observed during caplacizumab treatment as a reduction in plasma levels of vWF and FVIII (which has 
vWF as carrier molecule). The nonclinical development of caplacizumab showed that the Nanobody 
avidly binds to the A1 domain of human vWF in vitro (KD = 3.76 pM) and inhibits potently ristocetin-
induced binding of vWF to platelets (IC50 = 0.26 nM) in a PD assay. Results from in vitro perfusion 
chamber experiments demonstrated that caplacizumab selectively inhibits platelet adhesion at high 
shear rates, such as those observed in normal arterioles and stenotic arteries. Under these conditions, 
platelet adhesion was completely inhibited by 
 0.4 μg/mL of caplacizumab. The antithrombotic effect 
of caplacizumab was further demonstrated in ex vivo perfusion studies, using blood from healthy 
∼
individuals and PCI patients. For all PCI patients, complete inhibition of platelet adhesion ex vivo was 
observed when 0.8 μg/mL caplacizumab was spiked to the human blood. Results from a flow chamber 
experiment demonstrated that Caplacizumab blocked adhesion of  platelets to ULvWF secreted from

Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018

endothelial cells in the presence of plasma from TTP patients.  The effective caplacizumab 
concentration ranged from 0.2 μg/mL to 0.8 μg/mL and was correlated to the reduction of vWF levels 
in the patients' plasma. 
Caplacizumab was shown to be cross-reactive with tissues expressing vWF (i.e. megakaryocytes and 
endothelial cells) from guinea pigs and monkeys, but the Nanobody was not cross-reactive for mouse, 
rat, dog and rabbit vWF.  
Caplacizumab displays a similar in vitro pharmacology profile on human, cynomolgus monkey and 
guinea pig vWF. The monovalent building block of caplacizumab interacts with similar affinity to 
cynomolgus monkey vWF A1-domain (1 nM) compared to human vWF A1-domain (1 nM) and with 10-
fold less affinity to guinea pig vWF A1-domain (10 nM). Complete in vitro target neutralization by 
caplacizumab, measured as vWF mediated platelet aggregation in the presence of ristocetin (RIPA 
assay), was obtained at 0.4 µg/mL and 1-2 µg/mL for human and cynomolgus monkey/ guinea pg 
vWF, respectively. Furthermore, a similar caplacizumab concentration was required in binding studies 
for full target occupancy (human: 1-3 µg/mL, cynomolgus monkey/ guinea pig 2-5 µg/mL). 
Cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig were thus selected as the relevant species for the pivotal toxicity 
studies.  
In vivo  
In an arterial thrombosis model (Folts model) in vivo, the caplacizumab plasma concentration for 
complete antithrombotic efficacy (inhibition of cyclic flow reduction), was between 0.3 and 0.5 µg/mL. 
Biomarker analysis using ex vivo RIPA analyses demonstrated that complete inhibition of ristocetin-
induced PD response (platelet aggregation) correlated with the observation of complete antithrombotic 
efficacy. 
The in vivo efficacy of caplacizumab was evaluated in a baboon model of TTP after preventive and 
therapeutic treatment. In this model mimicking the early onset of acquired TTP, the disease is induced 
by functional inhibition of ADAMTS13 through administration of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody 
(3H9). Caplacizumab (2.5 mg/kg/day, s.c., q.d. for 5-7 days; effective plasma concentration range: 
145 - 407 ng/mL) was efficacious in preventing and treating typical features of an acute episode of 
aTTP (i.e. thrombocytopenia (drop in platelet counts) and schistocytic haemolytic anaemia (red blood 
cell fragmentation). The efficacy of caplacizumab in the aTTP model correlated with suppression of the 
RICO PD marker. This acute disease model has limitations as no information is available regarding the 
long-term effect and /or relapses of the disease. However, the lack of such preclinical information is 
considered superseded by clinical efficacy data in patients.  
A sequential PK/PD modelling approach allowed the characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of 
caplacizumab in baboons, and of the relationship between exposure, vWF:Ag and platelet counts 
supporting the use of vWF:Ag as marker for efficacy. In terms of effects on bleeding and coagulation, 
the expected decrease in the vWF:Ag and FVIII:C levels in baboons after repeated administration of 
caplacizumab appears to have no obvious effects on bleeding and coagulation, as there were no effects 
on coagulation markers (PT, aPTT, TT and fibrinogen) and no signs of bleeding was revealed following 
brain CT scan or post-mortem analysis of different tissues.    
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The specificity of caplacizumab was assessed in tissue cross-reactivity studies in various species. 
Immunohistochemical staining of human, Cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig tissues demonstrated 
that caplacizumab only binds to vWF expressing cells (i.e. megakaryocytes and endothelial cells) and 
caplacizumab did not bind to human blood cells or thrombocytes. 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 22/88 
 
 
  
 
 
Further secondary pharmacology studies showed the absence of interference with vWF binding to 
collagen type VI, ADAMTS13 and fibrillary collagens. Moreover, caplacizumab did not interfere with the 
enzymatic activity of ADAMTS13 and caplacizumab did not affect the binding of FVIII to vWF. 
Caplacizumab showed no tissue cross-reactivity to mouse, rat, dog and rabbit. A general secondary 
pharmacology profiling panel for off-target activity was not provided considering that this is a biological 
product.  
A potential bleeding risk associated with caplacizumab treatment was assessed in various models as 
well as by an analysis of coagulation tests in toxicity studies. At therapeutic doses, caplacizumab was 
shown to increase template bleeding times in baboons which were correlated with an increased blood 
loss from surgical wounds but with no obvious signs of spontaneous or internal bleeding. At higher 
doses administered in the repeat dose toxicity studies, occasional macroscopic bleeding was observed 
(see toxicology section).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology (clinical signs including respiratory and circulatory systems, somatomotor activity 
and behaviour patterns; body temperature; ECGs and blood pressure) was evaluated in the repeat-
dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys and guinea pigs after intravenous (up to 12 mg/kg/day) 
and subcutaneous (up to 40 mg/kg/day) administration. Safety endpoints were included (clinical signs’ 
and visual observations) in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in order to address respiratory function and 
general behaviour in line with ICH S6 guideline for biotech derived products. 
No in vitro safety studies such as hERG channel testing were submitted considering that the drug 
product is an antibody/Nanobody. 
Overall, the safety pharmacology studies in vivo indicate that, besides bleeding, there are no adverse 
cardiovascular effects (ECG, blood pressure and heart rate) or any other findings concerning the safety 
parameters evaluated up to 40/mg/kg/day, yielding exposure margins of >20-fold to the predicted 
clinical exposure for the recommended dose of caplacizumab (10 mg/day, AUC=300 µg h/mL) as 
shown below: 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with caplacizumab 
considering that this is an antibody/Nanobody that specifically interacts with Von Willebrand factor. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic properties of caplacizumab were analysed in guinea pigs and baboons 
as cross-reactive species, as well as in mice (not cross-reactive). No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies 
were performed in Cynomolgus monkeys, but assessment of single dose pharmacokinetics of 
caplacizumab was included in a single-dose toxicity study. Caplacizumab PK/TK after repeated 
administration and the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was mainly investigated in toxicity 
studies conducted in guinea pig and Cynomolgus monkey. The distribution of caplacizumab 
radioactively labelled with 125I was examined in mice. 
Methods 
The concentration of caplacizumab in guinea pig and Cynomolgus monkey plasm was determined by an 
ELISA-based method. In short, caplacizumab in the samples was captured in microtiter plates using a 
bivalent anti-caplacizumab Nanobody followed by incubation with vWF and detected via its binding to 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 23/88 
 
 
  
 
 
vWF using purified polyclonal rabbit anti-vWF IgG. This ELISA method detects caplacizumab via its 
binding with vWF and as such, measures total active caplacizumab. 
In all toxicology studies with exception of the 26-week Cynomolgus monkey study, ADAs were 
determined by an ELISA-based bridging format in which anti-caplacizumab antibodies were captured 
with caplacizumab adsorbed to the wells of a 96-well microplate. Bound antibodies were detected using 
biotinylated caplacizumab and horseradish peroxidase-labelled extravidin which allowed visualisation 
via a substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).  
For the 26-week toxicity study, an ADA assay with improved drug tolerance was developed as an in 
solution-phase kinetics based homogenous bridging assay (Gyrolab-based). Test samples were 
acidified to induce drug-antibody dissociation and improve tolerance towards free caplacizumab 
present in the samples. Subsequently, samples were neutralised in a mastermix containing an excess 
of biotinylated and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled caplacizumab. After binding of ADA to the labelled drug, 
the mix was transferred to neutravidin coated microstructures on compact disks CD’s in the Gyrolab 
system. The amount of fluorescence per microstructure was detected with the laser-induced 
fluorescence detector incorporated in the Gyrolab platform. 
Absorption 
Caplacizumab shows a non-linear kinetic profile. In all species, a first phase characterised by a rapid 
decline in plasma levels can be described at the higher doses immediately after administration (i.v.) or 
after peak plasma levels are reached (s.c.). This is likely caused by rapid distribution of the free 
caplacizumab, in combination with elimination via renal clearance.  
After i.v. administration in guinea pigs and Cynomolgus monkeys, Cmax increased in a dose linear 
manner, whereas the AUC decreased relative to the dose and a non-linear, less than proportional dose 
dependency was observed. The mean apparent terminal half-lives (t1/2) after i.v. administration 
ranged between 9 and 16 hours in guinea pigs, and between 8 and 37 hours in monkeys. 
After s.c. administration, drug plasma profiles were characterised by absorption-controlled kinetics. 
Both Cmax and AUC increased with increasing doses, but less than proportionally in both guinea pigs 
and monkeys. Absorption following s.c administration was rapid in guinea pigs (t max ranged between 2 
and 4 hours), while slower in monkeys with t max values ranging from 6 to 16 hours. The mean 
apparent terminal half-lives after s.c. administration was approximately 6 hours in guinea pigs and 
ranged between 16 and 27 hours in monkeys. The apparent bioavailability of caplacizumab after s.c 
administration was high, ranging from 79% to over 200% in guinea pigs and from 82% to 97% in 
monkeys. 
Distribution 
The in vivo biodistribution of 125I-radiolabeled caplacizumab was assessed in mice. As mouse vWF does 
not interact with caplacizumab, two groups of animals were assessed - one treated with free 125I-
caplacizumab and the other treated with 125I-caplacizumab in complex with human vWF to allow 
comparison of the two caplacizumab forms (free and vWF-complexed). 
Upon injection of free 125I-caplacizumab, the majority of the radioactivity was found in blood, kidneys 
and liver with little amounts of radioactivity observed in other organs. Radioactivity was observed in 
the stomach as similarly described for other proteins and attributed to accumulation of iodine. When a 
complex of 125I-caplacizumab and human vWF was injected into the mice, the majority of radioactivity 
was found in the liver and in blood with minor amounts in the kidney. The results suggest that vWF-
bound caplacizumab targets the liver. In contrast, unbound caplacizumab appeared to distribute to the 
kidneys. In pregnant guinea pigs, exposure to traces of caplacizumab in foetuses was demonstrated

indicating placental transfer of caplacizumab in this species. Foetal exposure to caplacizumab in 
primates and humans remains uncertain, as proteins lacking an Fc portion are not thought to freely 
pass the placental barrier. 
Metabolism 
No dedicated metabolism studies were performed. 
Excretion 
No dedicated excretion studies were performed, but data from the biodistribution study in mice 
using 125I-radiolabeled caplacizumab suggest that free caplacizumab is eliminated  via the kidneys, 
while vWF-complexed caplacizumab appears to target and possibly be catabolized in the liver. 
Therefore, in cross-reactive species, it is assumed that caplacizumab plasma concentrations exceeding 
the vWF levels are eliminated in the kidneys , while the caplacizumab-vWF complex displays a slower 
elimination and presumably follow the natural fate of vWF via hepatic catabolism. This assumption is 
supported by the dose-dependent plasma concentration versus time curve observed in cross-reactive 
species and the detection of caplacizumab in the urine of treated Cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of caplacizumab was examined in compliance with ICH S6(R1). The toxicology of 
caplacizumab was evaluated in single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in both rodent (guinea pig) and 
non-rodent species (Cynomolgus monkey). All single and repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted 
in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Toxicokinetic investigations were performed in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in guinea pig and Cynomolgus monkey after both intravenous (i.v.) and 
subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. These animal species were considered appropriate for the non-
clinical safety evaluation of caplacizumab based on characterization of affinity towards species vWF A1 
domain, in vitro binding, functional assays and demonstrated in vivo pharmacodynamic effects. In the 
pivotal toxicity studies toxicokinetics and concurrent pharmaco-dynamic (PD) responses measured as 
neutralisation of von Willebrand factor (vWF) by RICO-analysis showed that the doses used were 
sufficient to reveal potential toxicological effects by caplacizumab. Full neutralisation of vWF activity, 
defined as a RICO activity lower than 20%, was demonstrated in Cynomolgus monkey throughout the 
treatment period for all treatment groups. For guinea pig, full pharmacodynamic effect on target 
neutralisation was shown for the intermediate and high dose group and partial inhibition was noted for 
the low dose group. This shows that caplacizumab is pharmacologically active in both species used for 
toxicity testing and that the animals were sufficiently exposed - for monkeys in all dose levels applied 
in repeat-dose toxicity studies - to provide complete target inhibition. Therefore, the species and the 
dose levels examined in toxicity studies were relevant as models for human safety assessment.

The single-dose toxicity studies conducted showed a low toxicity of caplacizumab following parenteral 
administration. Caplacizumab was evaluated following i.v. administrations up to 20 mg/kg in guinea 
pig and i.v. or s.c. administrations up to 8 mg/kg in Cynomolgus monkey with 2-week observation 
periods. No mortality or clinical signs of toxicity were observed in any of the animals in these studies. 
In addition, no caplacizumab related effects were observed for any of the animals regarding the body 
weight and body weight gain, the food and drinking water consumption and haematological 
parameters. Post-mortem macroscopic and histologic examination did not reveal any caplacizumab 
related changes. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with caplacizumab in guinea-pigs and Cynomolgus 
monkeys by i.v. or s.c. routes and designed to achieve continuous maximal target occupancy (target 
saturation) and maximal exposure using multiple dosing schemes. The selection of the highest dose 
used was guided by recommended dose volumes. Comparative mean systemic exposures reached in 
nonclinical studies and simulated clinical trials with caplacizumab are presented in the Table 3.

Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in all repeat-dose toxicity studies, as well as local 
tolerance assessments. Assessment of male and female fertility parameters including functional 
measurements was included in the 13-week study in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Caplacizumab was generally well tolerated. No caplacizumab-related hepatoxicity or nephrotoxicity was 
observed in any of the repeat-dose toxicity studies.  An increased bleeding tendency with concurrent 
decreases in plasma vWF:Ag and FVIII:C levels as well as changes in serum chemistry parameters 
related to the anti-thrombotic pharmacology of caplacizumab was observed in guinea pigs 
(haemorrhagic subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites) and Cynomolgus monkeys (haemorrhagic 
subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites, nose bleed, menorrhagia, hematomas at sites of animal 
handling or experimental procedures, prolonged bleeding at injection sites) at doses ranging from 0.04 
to 12 mg/kg/day by intravenous and 0.4 to 40 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous administrations . These 
effects elicited by caplacizumab in guinea pig and Cynomolgus monkey were generally dose-dependent 
and reversible. Urinalysis showed increased urinary bilirubin levels at some occasions in the mid and 
high dose groups in the 13-week study in Cynomolgus monkey. This finding was not observed in the 
26-week study with Cynomolgus monkey. The toxicokinetics data in both guinea pig and Cynomolgus 
monkey show that caplacizumab exposure varies between gender after both i.v. and s.c. 
administration. In the pivotal 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey Cmax- and 
AUC-levels were 1.5-1.7 times higher in males. NOAELs were set at the highest doses tested in all 
studies except the 26-week study in Cynomolgus monkey. In this study, the NOAEL was set to 4 
mg/kg/day based on a premature sacrifice of one male in the high dose-group administered 13.5 
mg/kg 3 times/day (40 mg/kg/day) on day 85 due to persistent signs of anaemia, increased bleeding 
tendency, abnormalities in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters including presence of 
anti-FVIII antibodies. It has not been shown that the severe toxicity seen is caused by the detected 
antibodies. As a result of retrospective screening of the 2-week, 13-week and 26-week toxicity studies 
in Cynomolgus monkey, four additional animals were identified that developed anti-FVIII antibodies 
during study drug administration albeit without clinical signs. In two of these cases, the presence of 
anti-FVIII antibodies was found to be transient under treatment.  Although bleedings are related to the 
primary pharmacology of caplacizumab, these events are adverse, and should not be disregarded when 
defining the NOAEL. Increased bleeding (dose dependent and reversible) was  observed at all doses 
tested and a NOAEL and exposure margin to the clinic is therefore not possible to define (see 
pharmacology section). It should be noted that all toxicity studies were performed in healthy animals 
and caplacizumab related effects may differ in aTTP patients. In summary, the main finding in repeat-
dose toxicity studies of caplacizumab in guinea pigs and Cynomolgus monkeys was an increased 
bleeding risk, which is related to the pharmacology of caplacizumab. 
Genotoxicity 
In line with ICH S6(R1), genotoxicity studies are not considered relevant for proteins and were not 
performed with caplacizumab. 
Carcinogenicity 
In line with ICH S6(R1), no carcinogenicity studies have been performed. No carcinogenic risk was 
identified based on the pharmacological mode of action, results from chronic dosing toxicity studies in 
Cynomolgus monkey (up to 26 weeks) or other specific characteristics of caplacizumab.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The potential effects of caplacizumab on male and female fertility was assessed by evaluation of the 
reproductive tract (organ weights and histopathological evaluation) in the 13- and 26-week repeat 
dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkey according to ICH S6(R1). The GLP-histopathological 
evaluation revealed no caplacizumab-related microscopic alterations in male or female reproductive 
organs. Male and female fertility including functional assessment were also included as part of a 13-
week repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey. At the end of the study period, male animals 
were evaluated for testicular size by ultrasound and for sperm function by spermiogram (both non-
GLP), in addition to histopathological analysis of testis and epididymis (GLP). In female animals, in 
addition to histopathological analysis of the reproductive organs (GLP-compliant), oestrus cycles were 
monitored by analysis of vaginal cytology every 28 days, starting on day 35 (with day 0 as first day of 
dosing; non-GLP compliant). Based on results obtained in the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
Cynomolgus monkey it appears that no caplacizumab related effects were observed on the male and 
female fertility parameters evaluated. The functional assessments on male and female fertility 
parameters, although conducted non-GLP, are considered well performed by qualified experts and 
therefore considered reliable. Further, as outlined in ICH S5(R2) histopathology of the testis has been 
shown to be the most sensitive method for detection of effects on spermato-genesis. 
To support clinical development in women of child bearing potential a formal segment II study on 
embryo-foetal development was conducted in guinea pigs by i.m. administration and a follow-up TK 
study to assess placental transfer as well as maternal and foetal plasma levels of caplacizumab. 
Exposure levels of caplacizumab were similar in this study as compared to other toxicity studies 
following s.c. injections. In the embryo-foetal development segment II study conducted in guinea pig 
none of the animals died prematurely. No signs of systemic maternal toxicity were noted and no 
treatment-related influence was noted on the body weight, the body weight gain, the net weight 
change from day 6 onwards and the food and drinking water consumption. No treatment-related 
influence was noted on the number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, resorptions, sex distribution, 
foetal and placental weights, number of live foetuses at birth and the values calculated for the pre-and 
post-implantation loss when compared to the control. No treatment-related malformations or variations 
were noted during external/internal macroscopic examinations of the foetuses or soft tissue 
examination of the foetal heads (according to WILSON). In addition, skeletal examination (according to 
DAWSON) revealed no treatment related malformations, variations or retardations. The embryo-foetal 
toxicity study in guinea pigs showed that high and relevant maternal exposure leading to some PD 
response did not lead to maternal toxicity beyond some bleeding events or defects in placenta 
function. The placental transfer study with caplacizumab in pregnant guinea pigs qualitatively 
demonstrated foetal exposure to caplacizumab but exact concentrations could not be measured in the 
foetuses. Exposure of the dams had no effects on foetal development.  
No juvenile toxicity studies were performed with caplacizumab considering that the intended clinical 
use is for treatment of adult patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  
Due to the clinical experience in pregnant vWF patients (type 1), which can serve as a model for 
predicting outcome of caplacizumab exposure of pregnant women or influences of caplacizumab 
treatment on fertility, and the lack of effects in the conducted embryo-foetal development study in 
guinea pigs, which did not cause concern on caplacizumab treatment during embryo- and 
organogenesis and later development, no pre- and postnatal development study were performed.

Toxicokinetic data 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was studied in a dedicated study in rabbits (a non-cross-reactive species), by 
caplacizumab administration via the i.v., s.c., i.m., intra-arterial (i.a.) and paravenous routes at doses 
up to 1.2 mg/kg b.w. administered in 0.5 mL/kg (Study 20340). 
Table 5: Overview of dedicated local tolerance with caplacizumab study in rabbits  
No treatment-related alterations were observed in the dedicated local tolerance study in rabbits. Local 
tolerance was also assessed after repeated administration as part of the 13- and 26-week repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig. In these studies, injection site oedema, 
induration, erythema, swelling, hematoma and/or bleeding were occasionally observed. These 
symptoms occurred mostly at comparable frequency in control and caplacizumab-treated animals and, 
except for bleeding, dose-dependency was not observed. Altogether, the local tolerance of 
caplacizumab in non-clinical studies was acceptable. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenic potential of caplacizumab was evaluated in Cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig as 
part of the analysis of the pharmacokinetic behaviour and toxicokinetic evaluation of caplacizumab. In 
the single-dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkey treatment emergent ADAs were observed in a 
few animals of the highest dose groups indicating a potential for immunogenicity. Thus, caplacizumab 
has low immunogenicity in guinea pigs and Cynomolgus monkeys.

Table 6: Summary of immunogenicity in repeat-dose toxicity studies 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Caplacizumab is a Nanobody (i.e. a protein) that is expected to undergo biodegradation into smaller 
peptides or amino acids which are considered non-toxic. Thus, the product is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment when used according to the labelling. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The non-clinical pharmacological properties of caplacizumab are considered sufficiently characterised 
using in vitro and ex vivo assays as well as in vivo models. Caplacizumab binds potently to the A1 
domain of human vWF (KD = 3.76 pM) and inhibits ristocetin-induced binding of vWF to platelets (IC50 
= 0.26 nM) in a PD assay. Caplacizumab is cross-reactive to vWF in Cynomolgus monkey and guinea 
pig, but displays no pharmacological activity in rats, mice and dog. Thus, Cynomolgus monkey and 
guinea pigs were selected as relevant species for the toxicology testing. The safety pharmacology 
studies in vivo indicate that, besides bleeding, there are no adverse cardiovascular effects (ECG, blood 
pressure and heart rate) or any other findings concerning the safety parameters analysed in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkey up to 40/mg/kg/day, yielding exposure margins of 
>100-fold to the predicted clinical exposure for the recommended dose of caplacizumab (10 mg/day). 
Safety endpoints (clinical signs, visual observations) were included in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in order to address respiratory function and general behavior in line with ICH S6 guideline for biotech 
derived products.

Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic of caplacizumab was investigated in guinea pigs and baboons as cross-reactive 
species, as well as in mice (not cross-reactive) following single or multiple dose administrations by the 
intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes. Caplacizumab toxicokinetics after repeat-dose 
administration was investigated in toxicology studies conducted in guinea pig and Cynomolgus 
monkey. ELISA analytical methods were developed to determine caplacizumab levels in biological 
samples. The analytical methods were validated and reliable across the concentration ranges tested in 
the studies. 
After repeated administration in guinea pig and Cynomolgus monkey in toxicology studies, 
accumulation of caplacizumab was observed. The observed accumulation is consistent with 
expectations for the dosing regimens (3/4 times per day) that were selected to attain sufficiently high 
levels of exposure to define a NOAEL and adequate exposure margins for clinical trials. In the clinical 
situation on the other hand, a once daily dosing regimen was chosen based on pharmacodynamic 
considerations, i.e. to maintain a complete suppression of the RICO activity, and limited accumulation 
was observed. 
Regarding immunogenicity, a few animals were ADA-positive during toxicity studies. A neutralising 
potential of the ADAs was not evaluated using a dedicated neutralisation antibody assay. Instead, the 
ADA results were correlated with results from PK and PD assays to evaluate any impact of ADA on 
caplacizumab levels and activity. In summary, two animals of the 2-week repeated dose toxicity study 
in Cynomolgus monkeys, both confirmed as ADA positive, were excluded for TK analysis because of 
deviating PK results (increasing caplacizumab concentrations over time) compared with the other 
animals, but were included for toxicity interpretation. Active exposure to drug was demonstrated 
through measurement of total active drug (by the use of a PK assay measuring both free and target-
bound caplacizumab) and PD assessment (vWF neutralization). 
Anti-drug antibodies were observed but did not affect drug exposure, with the exception of one animal 
in the 26-week Cynomolgus monkey study, which consequently was excluded from the study 
interpretation. 
No dedicated metabolism or excretion studies were performed and this is considered acceptable and in 
line with ICH S6(R1). The metabolic pathways of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals are generally 
understood and include degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids.  
Taken together, the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab has been adequately characterized from a 
preclinical perspective. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity of caplacizumab has been adequately characterised in relevant non-clinical species at 
pharmacologically active dose levels. Active exposure to caplacizumab was demonstrated through 
measurement of total active drug and PD assessment (vWF neutralization). In all studies, 
pharmacology-related decreases in vWF:Ag and consequently FVIII:C were noted in Cynomolgus 
monkey and to a lesser extent in FVIII:C in guinea pig. Excessive pharmacology in the form of 
increased bleeding was identified as the only relevant safety risk. Increased bleeding (dose dependent 
and reversible) was  observed at all doses tested and a NOAEL and exposure margin to the clinic is 
therefore not possible to define. It should be noted that all toxicity studies were performed in healthy 
animals and caplacizumab related effects may differ in aTTP patients. The local tolerance of 
caplacizumab in non-clinical studies was acceptable.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis methods 
In support of the Phase Ia clinical study ALX-0081-01/06 the concentration of caplacizumab in human 
plasma was determined as total active caplacizumab by an ELISA-based assay measuring both free 
and target-bound active caplacizumab. Detection occurred via its target (vWF) using a polyclonal rabbit 
anti-human vWF antibody (Ab) and before detection excess vWF was added to saturate all active 
nanobodies. 
In all other clinical studies, the PK assay strategy was adjusted by using a target independent ELISA 
assay, measuring total caplacizumab. In this format human plasma samples were pre-incubated with 
acid to overcome target or pre-Ab interference. These samples were captured in microtiter plates 
coated with a mouse monoclonal anti-caplacizumab antibody and caplacizumab captured onto the 
coated plates was detected using a biotinylated anti-caplacizumab nanobody. 
Bioanalysis of pharmacodynamic markers and ADA 
The activity of the drug is also monitored using the Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation (RIPA) or 
Ristocetin Cofactor Activity (RICO) Assay as a pharmacodynamics (PD) marker. The antibiotic 
Ristocetin activates vWF, which is similar to high shear blood flow conditions which causes platelet 
agglutination. The mechanism can be blocked by the interaction of caplacizumab with vWF. Both 
assays yield equivalent results but an advantage of RICO over RIPA is that the former assay may be 
performed using frozen plasma and lyophilized donor platelets. 
Also, the level of vWF antigen in plasma samples were followed. The diagnostic immune-assay kit STA-
LIATESTVWF:Ag was validated and used in the TTP PhII study ALX-0681-2.1/10 and in the PhI 
bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers (ALX-0681-C102). In this diagnostic assay the vWF-antigen 
present in test samples is captured using anti-vWF antibodies that are covalently bound to latex 
microparticles. The formed antigen/antibody complex results in an agglutination of the latex 
microparticles which is measured turbidimetrically. The von Willebrand factor antigen measurement is 
performed using the spiking method, in which the Owren-Koller diluent contains at least 5.0 µg/mL 
caplacizumab.  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses were detected using an ELISA based sequential bridging assay in 
the Phase I studies as well as in the Phase II PCI trial (ALX-0081-2.1/09). This assay could not tolerate

presence of drug in the study samples but was considered fit for purpose in support of earlier studies 
with short-term caplacizumab treatment. 
From the Phase II TTP study (ALX-0681-2.1/10) an improved drug tolerance assay was implemented 
which was also used in support of the PhI bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers (ALX-0681-
C102). The homogenous bridging assay utilises a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. In this assay 
format human serum samples possibly containing anti-caplacizumab antibodies were pre-incubated 
overnight with an excess of biotinylated and sulpho-tagged caplacizumab. The formed immune 
complexes were captured on a streptavidine coated MSD plate and detected via 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL). 
ADA positive subjects included in the TTP PhII study ALX-0681-2.1/10 were further characterized in an 
additional assay to differentiate pre-Ab from treatment emerging (TE) ADA. This assay (mADA) is a 
modification of the homogenous bridging assay on the MSD platform, by using a C-terminal alanine 
extended analogue of caplacizumab (addition of one alanine) as the sulpho tagged detection tool (sulfo 
tagged ALX-0081-ala). The mADA assay predominantly measures TE ADA, as pre-Ab will not or to a 
lesser extent bridge in this assay format. Only TE ADA responses restricted to the C-terminal region in 
the Nanobody will be left undetected using the mADA assay and cannot be differentiated from pre-Ab.  
Data analysis 
A population PK/PD model, characterising the relationship between drug exposure and the 
pharmacodynamics effect (in terms of total vWF levels), was built using nonlinear mixed-effects 
modelling. 
Data was included from Study 1 (ALX-0081/0681-01/06), Study 2 (ALX-0081/0681-1.2/08a) and

1.1/08 First part) and Study 6 (ALX-0081/0681-1.1/08 Second part), Study 7 (ALX-0081/0681-
2.1/09), Study 8 (ALX-0681-2.1/10), Study 9 (ALX-0681-C102) and Study 10 (ALX-0681-C301). 
The caplacizumab-vWF pkpd model included a two-compartment drug disposition model with first-
order linear elimination of free drug and two parallel first-order absorption processes following s.c. 
dosing of caplacizumab. The model described the formation of a drug-vWF complexes with the ability 
to both form dimer and trimers. The production, maturation and release of vWF were described by 
transit compartments and a vWF pool with feedback effects stimulating the production and release of 
vWF when vWF decrease below the subjects baseline level. For aTTP patients, disease progression and 
effects governed by PE treatment were adequately captured by i) a disease progression model 
dependent on time and ii) removal of free vWF, free drug and drug-vWF complex by PE.  
Absorption  
The proposed dosing schedule of caplacizumab includes an intravenous dose on day 1 and following 
days the drug is administered subcutaneously. The absolute bioavailability of caplacizumab was 
estimated to 90.1% in the population pkpd analysis.  
Bioequivalence 
A single centre, open-label, randomized, single dose cross-over bioequivalence study to compare the 
reconstituted lyophilised formulation (to be marketed) with the reference liquid formulation of 
caplacizumab. 24 healthy subjects were included, a total dose of 10 mg was administered s c, and 
PK/PD sampling was performed for 6 days. The total washout time between doses was 14 days. 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 34/88 
 
 
  
 
 
Bioequivalence was shown both for Cmax (ratio 97.2 , 90% CI 93.8-100.8) and AUC0-∞ (ratio 102.4,  
90% CI 97.8-107.3). 
PD parameters RICO and vWF:Ag were also measured at the same timepoints. The results were similar 
between treatments. A statistically significant difference in onset of complete RICO inhibition was 
observed, where median time to onset for treatment A was 2 hours and treatment B was 4 hours. The 
duration of RICO inhibition as well as tmax/Emax for vWF:Ag were however the same. 
After subcutaneous administration, caplacizumab is rapidly and almost completely absorbed (estimated 
F> 0.901) in the systemic circulation. 
Distribution 
After absorption, caplacizumab binds to the target and distributes to well perfused organs. In patients 
with aTTP the central volume of distribution was estimated at 6.33 L. 
Elimination 
Caplacizumab is subject to target-mediated drug disposition meaning that its pharmacokinetics (PK) is 
influenced by the binding to vWF. It is also subject to non-target mediated elimination which may be a 
combination of catabolism and renal elimination. 
No elimination studies have been performed. For a protein of this size, renal filtration followed by 
metabolism in the kidney is expected for the free drug. The target bound drug is expected to be 
hepatically cleared as its complex with vWF (se PKPD model). 
Caplacizumab half-life is concentration- and target level dependent.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Caplacizumab has a molecular weight of 28 kDa, which is below a commonly accepted threshold of 70 
kDa for glomerular filtration. Thus, caplacizumab is expected to be subject to glomerular filtration. The 
effect of impaired renal function on caplacizumab pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in 
the TTP population. The impact of reduced renal function (as measured by creatinine clearance, CRCL) 
on the linear clearance of caplacizumab was tested in the pkpd model. The effect was statistically 
significant but numerically small; the effect of CRCL was implemented as a power model and estimated 
to 0.15. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal study of the impact of hepatic impairment on the PK of caplacizumab has been performed. 
Caplacizumab, free or bound, is expected to be subject to protein catabolism and liver impairment in 
itself is not expected to have an impact on this catabolism. 
Gender 
In the dataset for the pkpd model, 41.4% of the subjects were female. The pk of caplacizumab was not 
seen to be different between male and female subjects.  
Race 
The majority (89.5%) of the subjects in the PKPD dataset were Caucasian. No definitive conclusions 
can be drawn regarding the impact of race on the pk of caplacizumab. A slight difference could be

detected in the baseline value of VWF:Ag comparing Caucasian subjects to Black subjects. This 
difference is not expected to influence the response to caplacizumab treatment. 
Weight 
In the pooled population PK data set body weight ranged from 46.5 kg to 150 kg with a median value 
of 80 kg. This effect of body weight on caplacizumab PK was included in the population PK model using 
allometric scaling of disposition parameters with fixed exponents. The effect of body weight on the pk 
of caplacizumab was limited and resulting in an even smaller difference in pharmacodynamic response. 
Age 
The median age (min – max) in the pkpd data set was 52 years (18 years – 85 years). Based on 
literature data (Albnez S, Ogiwara K, Michels A, Hopman W, Grabell J, James P and Lillicrap D, 2016, 
Aging and ABO blood type influence von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels through interrelated 
mechanisms. Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis: JTH vol. 14: 953–963).  In Healthy volunteers 
and PCI patients, age was included as a covariate on the complex elimination rate constant (Kcom) 
with younger patients (<40 years) having 50% faster elimination. The effects of age identified in 
healthy volunteers and PCI patients are not considered of any particular concern, and were not 
confirmed in the aTTP patient population. 
ADA 
Only 6 aTTP patients showed evidence of treatment-emerging anti-drug antibodies (ADA). No effect of 
ADA was seen in the updated population PKPD analysis. Individual observed data did not reveal any 
major impact on the PK or PD of caplacizumab. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro or in vivo DDI studies have been performed.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The normal processing of vWF from ultralarge multimers to normal sized multimers is blocked by 
inhibitory antibodies against the proteolytic enzyme ADAMTS13 in aTTP. This will lead to the formation 
of ULvWF-mediated microthrombi. Current standard of care consists of immunosuppressants which will 
block the formation of these antibodies, and PE which has a triple action of (i) removing ULvWF and 
introducing donor vWF, (ii) removing inhibitory antibodies against ADAMTS13 and (ii) replenishing 
active ADAMTS13 from the donor plasma. Caplacizumab blocks the ULvWF-mediated platelet 
interaction, which can be measured through a PD marker for vWF neutralisation (vWF:RICO), see 
figure below.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic markers in clinical studies 
In study ALX-081-01/06 the RIPA assay was used to measure the neutralisation of vWF by 
caplacizumab. Full inhibition of RIPA was defined as maximal aggregation <10%. 
In all placebo-treated subjects, except in subject 1002 from the first cohort, the RIPA results remained 
unchanged and were within the normal variation of the assay. In the first 2 cohorts, no consistent 
decrease of RIPA was observed for all subjects dosed with caplacizumab. From cohort 3 (4 mg) 
onwards, all subjects receiving caplacizumab showed an inhibition to values below 10%, which 
occurred directly at the end of the infusion at 1h post, lasting from 1 to 6 h after start of infusion. 
In subjects treated with caplacizumab, transient decreases in vWF:Ag levels were noted after dosing. 
These decreases reached a maximum between 6h and 12h post-dose and ranged from about 20% to 
40% of baseline. vWF:Ag levels recovered to baseline levels from 24h to 48h after dosing. In the 
placebo treated subjects, no substantial changes in vWF:Ag levels were noted during the study. No 
dose dependency could be assigned to these changes in vWF:Ag.  
In study ALX-0681-1.1/08, RICO was used as a measurement of vWF activity, and a RICO activity  
of <20% reflected complete inhibition of vWF to bind platelets.   
In the placebo treated subjects, no changes in RICO were noticed, while in all treatment groups of the 
caplacizumab treated subjects, a rapid decrease from baseline could be found. Decreases below the 
threshold for complete RICO inhibition (<20%) were noted in all treatment groups and were reversible. 
In the dose groups of the SAD part, complete RICO suppression was observed from 4 to 12h after 
dosing and returned to baseline after approximately 72 h after dosing. Similarly for both the MD 
groups, a rapid and sustained decrease below the threshold for complete RICO inhibition could be 
observed which pertained from Day 1 to 8 (7-day MD group) and Day 1 to16 (14- day MD group). 
Assessment Report

Levels were back at baseline for the follow up measurement at Day 15 and 22 for the 7-day and 14-
day MD group. 
In study ALX-0681-2.1/10, all patients received 10 mg daily doses of caplacizumab and RICO was 
used as the measure of vWF activity. 
At Baseline, the mean RICO activity was approximately 80% in both treatment groups. In the 
caplacizumab treatment group, the mean RICO activity was reduced to levels close to or below 20% by 
Day 1 of daily PE. Mean RICO activity remained mostly < 20% throughout the first week of the daily 
PE treatment period, with the exception of some subjects with treatment interruption or withdrawal. 
Mean RICO activity was as well < 20% throughout the post-daily PE period. By Day 3 of the follow-up 
period, mean RICO activity in the caplacizumab treatment group had increased to approximately 40%. 
By Day 7 of the follow-up period, mean RICO activity had returned to Baseline levels in the 
caplacizumab treatment group.  
Mean vWF:Ag levels were higher at baseline compared to the mean vWF:Ag levels observed in healthy 
subjects (180% and 190% in the caplacizumab and placebo treated group respectively). In the 
caplacizumab treatment group, there was a decrease in mean vWF:Ag levels by Day 1 of daily PE. The 
mean vWF:Ag levels decreased further by Day 2 of daily PE to about 100% and remained at similar 
levels until the first day after daily PE. Thereafter, vWF:Ag levels increased slightly during the post-
daily PE period, but remained well below Baseline levels throughout dosing. After caplacizumab 
treatment was stopped, vWF:Ag levels quickly returned to Baseline levels by Day 7 of follow-up. In the 
placebo treatment group, after an initial slight decrease, vWF:Ag levels increased to above Baseline 
levels and remained at above or around Baseline until the end of the post daily PE period and finally 
decreased to about 150% at the follow up period.  
Only one dose (10 mg daily) was tested in aTTP patients or in the multiple-dose setting in healthy 
volunteers. The Applicant provides a discussion regarding the choice of dose, based on expected 
exposure and corresponding effect on total vWF:Ag levels for different dose levels, simulated from the 
PKPD model. The model predicted that target drug levels ensuring the desired pharmacodynamics 
effect can be attained with the proposed dosing regimen, but not with a lower dose of 5 mg per day. A 
higher dose of 15 mg od would not substantially increase efficacy. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general the bioanalysis methods in use to support the PK and PD in the clinical studies are 
adequately validated. 
The additional characterisation method in use to distinguish between pre-existing antibodies (Pre-Ab) 
and treatment emerging (TE) ADA was not satisfactory to detect TE ADA in subjects classified as 
equivocal (pre-Ab levels above a defined threshold that can defy detection of TE ADA). However, a 
strategy is in place to take into consideration the post-dose ADA signals for the data interpretation 
which is acceptable. 
In the SAD and MAD studies in healthy volunteers, the AUC increased less than dose proportionally. 
This can be interpreted as a saturation of the target with higher dose, and a more rapid clearance of 
excess free caplacizumab. Caplacizumab is subject to target-mediated drug disposition meaning that 
its pharmacokinetics (PK) is influenced by the pharmacodynamics (PD). Due to the complex PK and PD 
relationships, the use of modelling and simulation to support the characterisation of caplacizumab PK 
and the pharmacodynamic effects was used. The model was considered to describe the data and 
perform simulations within the studied range of doses, treatment period, covariate values and other 
determinants of the model. The model provides support for the selected dosing regimen.

The bioequivalence study has shown bioequivalence in terms of PK between the solution formulation 
and the lyophilised formulation to be marketed. The minor PD difference seen regarding RICO 
inhibition is not considered clinically relevant. The population PKPD model also support bioequivalence 
between the two formulations. 
The Applicant included the effect of body weight on the non-target mediated clearance of caplacizumab 
in the population model using allometric scaling. Simulations show that the influence of body weight on 
the exposure to caplacizumab and pharmacodynamic response was limited. 
No elimination studies have been performed. This is acceptable. For a protein of this size, renal 
filtration followed by metabolism in the kidney is expected for free drug. Even though reduced renal 
function was found to have a limited effect on the disposition of caplacizumab, the Applicant explored 
the issue by simulating the effect of a substantial decrease in the linear non-target mediated 
clearance. The effect on caplacizumab exposure was still limited and did not impact the 
pharmacodynamic response according to the pkpd model. The target bound drug is expected to be 
hepatically cleared as its complex with vWF. 
The Applicant looked at the impact of ADA on the individual PK and PD data for the 6 aTTP patients 
that developed ADA during treatment and compare to the whole population. There was no sign of 
deviation from the PK and PD compared to the total population. 
No in vitro or in vivo DDI data have been provided. No classical pharmacokinetic interactions are 
expected for this type of protein. It is also agreed that the vWF-pathway is not likely to regulate CYP 
enzyme expression. The lack of data is thus acceptable. The TTP patients are co-medicated with 
immunosuppressants, which likely modulate the disease. 
The PD data collected on vWF activity (RICO/RIPA) from healthy volunteers as well as TTP patients 
confirms the pharmacological effect and that 10 mg is an active dose. A modelling exercise was used 
to confirm that the proposed 10 mg od dosing regimen is adequate.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of caplacizumab have been characterised in 
healthy volunteers and in aTTP patients.

Treatments 
Study drug 
The first study drug administration was as an i.v. bolus within 6 hours to 15 minutes prior to initiation 
of the first on-study PE or, after implementation of Protocol Version 12.0, the second PE session (if the 
subject was randomised after a single PE session). The first on-study PE was followed by s.c. 
administration of study drug within 30 minutes after the end of the PE procedure. Subsequently, daily 
s.c. administrations of 10 mg caplacizumab or placebo in adult subjects followed each PE session for 
the duration of PE (including tapering and PE given for exacerbations) and once daily for 30 days 
following the last PE, including tapering. If 2 PE sessions were scheduled per day, study drug was 
administered within 30 minutes after the end of the PE procedure resulting in a daily dose of 20 
mg. Study drug administration continued in case of re-initiation of PE for an exacerbation of TTP with a 
maximum total treatment duration limited to 90 days after first administration of study drug. The 
“study drug post- PE” period (period of 30 days after the very last PE; see further below) re-
commenced once PE that was reinitiated due to the exacerbation was again stopped. Re-initiation of 
study drug treatment in case of TTP relapse (defined as de novo event of TTP that occurred later than 
30 days after the last daily PE) was not permitted. Tapering prolonged study drug administration and 
delayed the start of the “study drug post-PE” period. It was therefore possible that a relapse 
could occur ≥ 30 days after the last daily PE, but before the end of the 30-day period of study 
drug administration post-PE. In this case, the study drug was to be discontinued at the restart of 
the PE treatment. 
Selection of dose 
The initial i.v. administration of study drug prior to the first PE on study was justified based upon a 
Phase I study in healthy subjects, as well as a Phase Ib study in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
patients. In both studies, an immediate complete target neutralisation was observed, namely RIPA ≤ 
10% in healthy subjects and RICO ≤ 20% in ACS patients treated with the biologically effective dose. 
For the Phase I study in healthy subjects, minimal effective dose was 2 mg and saturation of the effect 
was achieved with the highest dose of 12 mg. For the Phase Ib study, a single dose of 6 mg, followed 
by 3 subsequent doses of 4 mg every 6 hours, given as i.v. bolus injections was established to be the 
biological effective dose. It was anticipated that all active ULvWF present in the blood that has not yet 
aggregated platelets can be inhibited from further platelet aggregation by saturating it with the 
immediate i.v. injection of 10 mg anti-vWF Nanobody. This allowed for the predicted protection by 
the investigational product against UL-vWF mediated microthrombus formation until the time of start 
of PE therapy.  
The further administrations of the investigational drug were performed by the s.c. injection route. The 
proposed s.c. dosing regimen of the caplacizumab was investigated in a Phase I study with healthy 
subjects. The daily dosing of caplacizumab 10 mg as s.c. injection resulted in a complete and 
sustainable inhibition of the biomarker RICO, indicating the complete suppression of vWF-mediated 
platelet adhesion for 24 hours.

Clinically relevant bleeding was the main potential risk based on the pharmacological action of 
caplacizumab . It was defined as moderate to severe (including life-threatening) bleeding requiring 
urgent medical and/or surgical intervention. In case of clinically relevant bleeding, appropriate 
treatment for bleeding according to standard practice was to be initiated and treatment with study 
drug was to be interrupted. In addition, plasma levels of vWF:Ag and FVIII:C were determined. If 
FVIII:C levels were < 10% the presence of anti-FVIII antibodies was to be assessed, and if presence 
was confirmed, study drug was to be permanently discontinued. If either or both vWF:Ag and FVIII:C 
were at clinically significant low levels as judged by the treating physician, administration of vWF and 
FVIII through commercially available combination preparations, such as Haemate-P or equivalent 
antihaemophilic factor/vWF complex, was to be initiated and continued until the bleeding stopped. 
Study drug could only be restarted when the bleeding had stopped and vWF:Ag >50% and 
FVIII:C levels were within normal range as per local lab ranges. The PE treatment, if applicable, was to 
be continued as clinically indicated. 
Standard of care 
Subjects received the standard of care and treatment judged appropriate by the Investigator at each 
site and according to site guidelines for treatment of TTP. The principal treatment for acquired TTP was 
daily PE. Local practice differs with regard to the frequency of PE being occasionally reduced 
(“tapered”) rather than stopped completely at time of response which was at the discretion of the 
Investigator, though not recommended per this protocol.   
Additional treatment could include one or more of the following, which was also variable depending on 
local standard practice: adjunctive immunosuppressive treatment (e.g., corticosteroids, rituximab), 
antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), supportive therapy with red cell transfusion or folate 
supplementation and treatment with vincristine or cyclosporin in case of refractory TTP. After platelet 
counts had partially recovered, LMWH could be used prophylactically in subjects at high risk of venous 
thromboembolism. In this case heparin was administered according to local institutional guidelines, or 
in the absence of these, after a platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μL had been reached.  
Prior therapy 
Upon inclusion in the study, chronic treatment with anticoagulant treatment such as vitamin K 
antagonists, heparin (or LMWH) and non-acetyl salicylic acid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory molecules 
was discontinued. If recommended by local guidelines, aspirin could be continued. Heparin could be 
administered according to local institutional guidelines, or in the absence of these, after a platelet 
count of ≥ 100,000/μL had been reached. Study drug administration continued in case of re-initiation 
of PE for an exacerbation of TTP with a maximum total treatment duration limited to 90 days after first 
administration of study drug. Re-initiation of study drug treatment in case of TTP relapse (defined as 
de novo event of TTP that occurred later than 30 days after the last daily PE) was not permitted

Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Time to recovery of platelets (≥ 150,000/μL), confirmed at 48 hours after the initial reporting of 
platelet recovery by a de novo measure of platelets ≥ 150,000/μL and LDH ≤ 2 x ULN. Observations 
were censored at 30 days after first administration of study drug. 
Main secondary endpoints 
•  Number and percentage of subjects with complete remission (defined as confirmed platelet 
response and absence of exacerbation for 30 days after the last daily PE); 
•  Number and percentage of (subjects with) exacerbations of aTTP (defined as recurrent 
thrombocytopenia following a confirmed platelet response and requiring a re-initiation of daily 
PE treatment between ≥ 1 day but ≤ 30 days after the last daily PE) and time to first 
exacerbation of aTTP. However, due to a discrepancy between the protocol and the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), this analysis was reported through up to 12-months of follow-up (as 
described in the SAP) with a post-hoc analysis of all exacerbations/relapses reported through 
up to 1 month of follow-up;  
•  Number and percentage of subjects relapsing with aTTP (defined as de novo event of aTTP that 
occurs later than 30 days after the last daily PE); 
• 
Total mortality within the daily PE treatment period and within the subsequent study drug 
treatment period (including tapering). 
In addition, in line with the amended protocol version 12.0, a stratified analysis based on the presence 
(n=6) or absence of a prior PE before randomization was performed for all primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints.  
Sample size 
Originally, the study was to enroll 110 subjects in a 1:1 allocation to caplacizumab or placebo. This 
sample size was based on a log-rank test with a power of 80% at a one-sided 2.5% significance level 
to detect a 44% reduction in median time-to-platelet response (3.4 days on caplacizumab compared to 
6 days on placebo). The sample size also incorporated an assumption that 15% of subjects would be 
lost-to-follow-up. 
The study was open for enrolment from October 2010 to January 2014, when recruitment was halted 
because of persistent recruitment challenges in this orphan disease setting. Seventy-five patients were 
randomized: 36 to the caplacizumab group and 39 to the placebo group. 
Randomisation 
Adult subjects were assigned to one of the two treatments via an interactive web-based system 
according to a computerised randomisation schedule. Adolescent subjects were not to be randomised 
and were to receive only caplacizumab. No adolescents were treated during the study. 
When the randomisation number and treatment assignment were obtained, the randomisation number 
was recorded on the case report form (CRF). As this was a single-blinded study, the Investigator was 
informed of the treatment at the time of randomisation.

Blinding (masking) 
This is a single-blinded study. 
Statistical methods 
In addition to the Protocol, a description of the statistical methods applied in this study was given in 
the SAP (dated 09-Dec-2013). The final SAP was finalised before the database lock on 23-May-2014. 
All hypothesis testing was 2-sided unless otherwise specified and carried out at the 5% significance 
level and designed to evaluate the superiority of caplacizumab    
to placebo. No adjustment for multiplicity was applied to the analysis for the secondary variables. The 
primary, secondary and longer term endpoint analyses were based on available data. No imputations 
were made for missing data unless otherwise specified. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint, time-to-platelet response, was measured in days, hours and minutes 
from the time of first study drug administration. A KM analysis with time-to-response as the endpoint 
and treatment group as the independent variable was performed on the ITT and Per Protocol (PP) 
populations. An analysis was performed for all subjects and for subjects stratified for absence/presence 
of one PE session prior to randomization. If the response was not reached within 30 days after first 
administration of study drug or data were not available for any reason (e.g. death, withdrawal, loss-to-
follow-up), then the endpoint was censored for that subject. Caplacizumab was compared with placebo 
using a 1-sided log-rank test in order to assess superiority at 2.5% significance level. 
In addition to the KM estimates, the corresponding Cox proportional hazard regression model with 
Baseline disease characteristics (ADAMTS13 activity < 5% versus ≥ 5%, vWF:Ag level [continuous], 
first episode versus recurrent disease, presence or absence of RICO suppression of < 20% throughout 
treatment period, one PE prior to randomisation or not) was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) 
and associated 95% CIs for the HR for caplacizumab and the placebo group. This was represented by 
means of Forest plots. 
The time to first exacerbation of aTTP, first relapse of aTTP, and first exacerbation or relapse from first 
study drug administration, followed the same analysis method as the primary efficacy endpoint and 
was presented graphically. 
Sensitivity analyses consisted of analyses performed on the PP Population for the primary efficacy 
endpoint; analysis of the treatment effect adjusted for various covariates, such as ADAMTS13 activity 
at Baseline; analysis of non-confirmed and confirmed platelet response; assessment of impact of the 
use of rituximab during daily PE. 
Interim Analysis 
On 13-Jan-2014, the decision to stop subject recruitment into the study due to the low recruitment 
rate was communicated to the study sites. It was decided that the conduct of the study would be 
stopped when the last subject randomised reached the 1-month follow-up visit. The decision was not 
for any reason of safety; it was also not based on any analysis of data, neither formal nor informal, but 
was based on strategic considerations for further investment which required having the study data fully 
and formally analysed. 
An interim analysis for safety with formal stopping rules was performed when 28 of the caplacizumab 
treated subjects had been treated and assessed. The DSMB reviewed the safety data collected from

the first 56 subjects (evenly split between caplacizumab and placebo) enrolled and treated in the 
study, with an ensuing follow-up of 30 days. On 31-Jan-2014, the recommendation of the DSMB to 
continue the study with no changes to the Protocol based on the interim analysis results was 
communicated to the Sponsor. Since no efficacy analyses were included in the interim analysis, no 
alpha adjustment was made.

Recruitment 
Date of first enrolment: 7 Jan 2011; Date of last completed: 14 Mar 2014.  
32 active sites (out of 56 approved sites) in 11 countries: Australia (1 site), Austria (1 site), Belgium 
(4 sites), France (1 site), Germany (5 sites), Israel (2 sites), Italy (4 sites), Spain (3 sites), 
Switzerland (2 sites), United Kingdom (UK; 1 site) and the United States of America (USA; 8 sites). 
Note that the study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment challenges: 75 adult subjects (36 
to the experimental arm and 39 to placebo) were enrolled while 110 were planned in accordance with 
the sample size estimation. 
Conduct of the study 
The study recruitment was stopped before the planned number of patients was included due to the low 
recruitment rate. Seventy five patients were randomised into the study without follow-up.   
Several amendments to the protocol were done during the course of the study. For example the 
primary endpoint was changed before inclusion of the first patient. The inclusion- and exclusion 
criteria, the significance level, the definition of the ITT population and the number of patients were 
changed. Furthermore, several post-hoc analyses were performed that were neither described in the 
protocol nor in the SAP. A relatively large fraction of major protocol violations was reported as well as 
issues related to local and central laboratories, leading to issues with the sample/data integrity. In 
addition, fractions of missing data are for certain analyses large and sometimes unknown.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Stratified for absence/presence of one PE session prior to randomization, conducted on the ITT 
population. An observation was censored if it did not meet the defined time interval of 30 days after 
first administration of study drug, due to any cause of loss to follow-up (including death), or endpoint 
not being reached. 
The number and proportion of subjects in each treatment group with PE tapering were similar in the 
caplacizumab  
treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (11 [30.6%] subjects versus 11 [28.2%] 
subjects). 
Only 2 subjects in the experimental arm and 4 subjects in the control arm all patients had received PE 
prior to randomization.

Selected post-hoc analysis 
ADAMTS13 Activity in Relation to Exacerbation and Relapse – Post-Hoc Analysis (Safety population) 
Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (i.e., <10% of normal) is used to confirm the diagnosis of aTTP, and has 
been recognized as a potential biomarker for relapse risk during. The 10% cut-off level is increasingly 
considered more clinically relevant than the protocol specified cut-off of 5%. It was hypothesized that 
unresolved  disease  activity  (i.e.,  persistent  anti-ADAMTS13  antibodies),  reflected  by  ADAMTS13 
activity  levels  <10%  during  the  treatment  period,  could  account  for  early  relapse  observed  in  the 
caplacizumab  group.  Accordingly,  a  post-hoc  descriptive  analysis  was  performed  to  investigate  this 
possibility.  Events  preceded  by  a  continuous  severe  deficiency  in  ADAMTS13  during  the  treatment 
period  were  considered  as  a  recurrence  of  the  presenting  aTTP  episode  ('relapse  of  presenting 
episode').  Relapses  that  were  preceded  by  a  normalization  of  ADAMTS13  to  levels  above  10%  were 
considered de novo events. The relationship between low ADAMTS13 activity and exacerbation during 
the treatment phase was also explored. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 4. 
For  subjects  not  experiencing  a  recurrence  or  those  experiencing  a  relapse,  the  measurement  of 
ADAMTS13  activity  closest  to  the  treatment  stop  date  was  used.  For  those  experiencing  an 
exacerbation, the measurement of ADAMTS13 activity data closest to or on the day of the recurrence 
was used in this analysis.  
Subjects experiencing relapse (recurrence of aTTP during the follow-up period): 
In  the  caplacizumab  group,  11 subjects  experienced  a  relapse  during  the  follow-up  period.  The 
majority  of  them  (7 subjects)  relapsed  within  10 days  of  receiving  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  All  of 
these “early relapsing” subjects exhibited ADAMTS13 activity of < 10% from baseline through the last 
measurement  on  treatment,  indicating  ongoing  disease  activity  (Figure  4).  In  contrast,  all  4 subjects 
who  experienced  a  first  relapse  more  than  10 days  after  stopping  caplacizumab  had  an  ADAMTS13 
activity  ≥ 10%  during  and/or  near  the  end  of  the  treatment  period,  suggesting  resolution  of  their 
underlying  disease.  Relapse  in  these  subjects  occurred  much  later  (30-167 days  after  stopping 
caplacizumab), suggesting that it was associated with a de novo episode of aTTP, rather than a relapse 
of the presenting episode. 
In  the  placebo  group,  3  subjects  had  a  relapse.  All  of  the  relapses  occurred  beyond  the  1-month 
follow-up  period  (161-356 days  after  cessation  of  the  study  treatment).  Two  of  them  had  ADAMTS13

activity ≥ 10% during the treatment period, suggesting a de novo episode of aTTP.  One subject had a 
value  < 10%  during  the  study  drug  treatment  period  and  at  the  1-month  follow-up  visit.  No 
subsequent ADAMTS13 measurements are available for this subject.  
Subjects experiencing exacerbation (recurrence of aTTP during the treatment period): 
In the caplacizumab group, 3 subjects had an exacerbation, and all 3 had baseline ADAMTS13 activity 
<10%. Of them, 2 still had ADAMTS13 activity < 10% around the time of the exacerbation (range: 0–
8 days  prior  to  exacerbation)  and  1  had  ADAMTS13  activity  of  39%  on  the  day  of  the  exacerbation 
(Figure  4).  In  the  placebo  group,  11 subjects  had  an  exacerbation,  with  baseline  ADAMTS13  activity 
<10%  in  10  of  them.  ADAMTS13  data  around  the  time  of  exacerbation  were  available  for  8 of  these 
subjects (range 0-6 days prior to exacerbation); all but one had ADAMTS13 activity <10% at this time. 
The remaining subject had a result of 11%.

ALX0681-C301 (Hercules) study: A Phase III double-blind, randomized, parallel group, 
multicenter placebo-controlled trial to study the efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in 
patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.  
Methods 
Study Design 
This was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of caplacizumab when administered in addition to standard of care treatment in subjects with an 
acute episode of acquired TTP. The study evaluated the efficacy of caplacizumab in more rapidly 
restoring normal platelet counts. In addition, the effect of treatment with caplacizumab on a composite 
endpoint of TTP-related mortality, recurrence of TTP and major thromboembolic events during study 
drug treatment and on endpoints assessing recurrence of TTP during the overall study period, 
refractory TTP and time to normalization of organ damage marker levels, were evaluated. After

confirmation of eligibility to study participation and after the start of PE treatment (the maximum time 
allowed between the start of first PE (i.e., PE administered prior to randomization) and the start of the 
first PE after randomization (i.e., the first on-study PE) was 24 hours), subjects were randomized in a 
ratio of 1:1 to receive caplacizumab or placebo in addition to standard of care therapy. Randomization 
was stratified by severity of neurological symptoms (Glasgow coma scale [GCS]). 
All patients received the study drug up to 30 days after the end of daily PE. Risk-guided continuation 
for up to 28 additional days was possible in conjunction with optimized immunosuppression. 
In the case of exacerbation or recurrence during the treatment period all patients were switched to 
open label caplacizumab. This complicates interpretation of study outcomes. Relapse during FU was 
treated according to standard of care. There was no re-initiation of study drug administration for 
subjects experiencing more than one exacerbation or relapse. 
Study Participants  
Adults with a clinical diagnosis of acquired TTP who required initiation of daily PE treatment. 
The main criteria for inclusion were the following: 
•  Adult male or female ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form

Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
- To evaluate efficacy of caplacizumab in more rapidly restoring normal platelet counts as measure of 
prevention of further microvascular thrombosis 
Key Secondary Objectives, hierarchically ordered: 
- to evaluate the effect of study drug on a composite endpoint consisting of thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-related mortality, recurrence of TTP and major thromboembolic 
events during study drug treatment  
- to evaluate the effect of study drug on prevention of recurrence of TTP over the entire study period 
- to evaluate the effect of study drug on refractoriness to treatment 
- to evaluate the effect of study drug on biomarkers of organ damage: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and serum creatinine 
Other Secondary Objectives: 
- to evaluate the effect of study drug on plasma exchange (PE) parameters (days of PE and volume), 
days in intensive care unit (ICU), days in hospital 
- adverse events (AEs) 
- pharmacodynamic (PD) markers: von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), coagulation factor VIII 
clotting activity (FVIII:C), ristocetin cofactor activity (RICO) 
- pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
- immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ADA]) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: Time to platelet count response defined as initial platelet count ≥ 150×109/L with subsequent 
stop of daily PE within 5 days. 
Key secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints are hierarchically ordered as listed below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with TTP-related death, a recurrence of TTP, or at least one treatment-
emergent major thromboembolic event (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, 
pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis [DVT]) during the study drug treatment 
period (including extensions).  
Proportion of subjects with a recurrence of TTP in the Overall Study Period (including 4-week 
FU period). 
Proportion of subjects with refractory TTP, defined as absence of platelet count doubling after 4 
days of standard treatment, and LDH > upper limit of normal (ULN). 
Time to normalization of all 3 of the following organ damage marker levels: 
- Time to LDH ≤ 1 x ULN, and cTnI ≤ 1 x ULN, and serum creatinine ≤ 1 x ULN 
Other secondary endpoints

•  Proportion of subjects with recurrences of TTP as well as the number of such events during 
study drug treatment (including extensions) and after end of study drug treatment 
•  PE parameters: number of days and total plasma volume (absolute and normalized) in 2 time 
periods: initial daily PE period and full study drug treatment period  
•  Number of days in ICU and in hospital in 4 time periods: initial daily PE period, full study drug 
treatment  period,  in  the  FU  period  (of  4 weeks  after  stop  of  study  treatment)  and  Overall 
Study Period  
Sample size 
The planned sample size was approximately 132 adult subjects in 2 arms, randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
and stratified by severity of neurological involvement prior to randomization (GCS score ≤ 12 versus 
GCS score = 13 - 15). A total of 145 subjects (72 subjects to caplacizumab and 73 subjects to 
placebo) were enrolled (i.e., randomized) in the study. 71 subjects in the caplacizumab group and 73 
in the placebo group received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the Safety 
Population and in the mITT population. One subject randomized to caplacizumab withdrew consent 
prior to first dosing. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized to one of the 2 arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified by severity 
of neurological involvement (GCS ≤ 12 vs. GCS = 13-15). Stratification was foreseen to ensure 
balanced treatment arms for the secondary endpoints related to neurological involvement and not for 
the primary endpoint, for which the stratification parameter is not known to be relevant. 
Blinding (masking) 
In order to protect the integrity of the data, treatment assignment was kept blinded for investigational 
sites, subjects, site monitors, and other members of the study team, until the final database lock 
(when the last subject had completed the final FU visit and all data was considered clean). 
Note that all subjects experiencing a recurrence during the study drug treatment period subsequently 
received caplacizumab in an open-label design, irrespective of initial treatment allocation and without 
breaking the blind for the initial treatment allocation.  
Statistical methods 
Intent-to-treat population: All subjects who were randomized. 
The ITT population was used for selected general outputs (e.g., disposition) and for the main efficacy 
analysis. 
Modified intent-to-treat population: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 administration of 
study drug, as randomized. 
The modified ITT (mITT) population was used for selected (sensitivity) analysis of efficacy. 
Per-protocol (PP) population: The PP population is a subpopulation of the ITT population, excluding 
those subjects who had a major protocol deviation. 
Safety Population: All subjects who received at least 1 administration of study drug, as treated. 
The Safety Population was used for analysis of safety.

Analyses were handled differently before and after switch to open-label caplacizumab after recurrence, 
as specified below. 
Before switch to open-label caplacizumab the treatment group as assigned by the randomization was 
used (i.e., as-randomized analysis) for efficacy. For safety, PK, PD, disease-related markers and 
immunogenicity analyses the treatment that was actually used by the subject was applied (i.e., as-
treated analysis). 
Differences between as-treated and as-randomized were flagged in the listing on subject allocation. 
After switch to open-label caplacizumab an all-treated analysis was conducted in a separate pooled 
open-label caplacizumab treatment group, unless specified otherwise. For some specific analyses, e.g., 
for immunogenicity analyses, this pooling was not done. As a consequence, if open-label period is 
represented according to the randomized treatment, the actual treatment (Caplacizumab) can differ 
from represented treatment group (Placebo or Caplacizumab).

Treatment extension beyond 30 days after end of daily PE was observed for 20 subjects in the 
caplacizumab arm and 5 in the placebo group; here, the considerably higher number of subjects 
switching to caplacizumab OL in the placebo arm must be considered (26 vs 2 in the caplacizumab 
arm).  
In the caplacizumab arm, 9 subjects received the maximum duration of treatment, 30 + 28 days, 5 
subjects had 3 weeks of treatment extensions, 4 subjects had 2 weeks of treatment extensions and 2 
subjects had 1 week of treatment extension. 
Table 8: Summary table of treatment extensions and study terminations (ITT Population) 
Any major protocol deviation was reported for 45% of subjects in the caplacizumab arm and 43% in 
the placebo arm with “treatment non-compliance” being the most prevalent reason. However, the 
protocol deviations are not deemed likely to favour the experimental arm or to challenge the overall 
results of the study. 
Recruitment 
Of the 92 investigational sites that were initiated, 55 sites in 15 countries enrolled (i.e. randomized) 
subjects: Australia (3 centres), Austria (1 centre), Belgium (4 centres), Canada (4 centres), Czech 
Republic (2 centres), France (6 centres), Hungary (2 centres), Israel (4 centres), Italy (5 centres), The 
Netherlands (1 centre), Spain (6 centres), Switzerland (1 centre), Turkey (3 centres), United Kingdom 
(3 centres) and the United States of America (10 centres).

Consent was obtained from the first subject on 19 Nov 2015, the last subject completed the final visit 
on 16 Aug 2017. 
Overall, 108 subjects (74.5%) completed the study (i.e., completed treatment and had their final 
follow-up visit) and 37 subjects (25.5%) discontinued from the study. 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, 64 subjects (44.1%) had a major protocol deviation; 31 subjects (43.1%) in the caplacizumab 
group and 33 subjects (45.2%) in the placebo group. Overall, the most commonly reported category of 
major protocol deviations was “treatment non-compliance”, reported in 36 subjects (24.8%) 
(caplacizumab group: 15 subjects [20.8%]; placebo group: 21 subjects [28.8%]), followed by 
“selection criteria not met” reported in 21 subjects (14.5%) (caplacizumab group: 11 subjects 
[15.3%]; placebo group: 10 subjects [13.7%]). 
There were two protocol amendments relating to: 
•  A change in exclusion criteria: to exclude subjects who were previously enrolled in a clinical 
study with caplacizumab and received caplacizumab or for whom the assigned treatment arm 
is unknown and removal of the planned interim analysis 
•  A change in planned sample size (increased from 92 to 132 to account for a change in the 
assumed treatment difference for the primary endpoint in the sample size calculation) 
• 
The inclusion of subjects aged 2 to 18 years

Generally, baseline data is not likely to favour the experimental arm. A higher fraction of subjects with 
a recurrent episode is noted in the placebo arm. For 7 subjects with baseline ADAMTS13 activity of 
≥10% (4 subjects in the caplacizumab group and 3 subjects in the placebo group), the diagnosis 
of aTTP could not be confirmed based on prior medical history of TTP or other available information 
including subsequent measurements of ADAMTS13 activity. 
Immunosuppressive medications 
During the overall study period, slightly more patients in the placebo arm received rituximab (49% vs 
40%) while other immunosuppressive medication, mainly MMF, was more commonly delivered in the 
caplacizumab arm (14% vs 6%). 
During the DB daily PE period 30% of subjects in the placebo arm vs 17% in the caplacizumab arm 
received rituximab.  
During the DB post daily PE period roughly equal fractions in the study arms received rituximab, 35-
37%. 
For context, during the DB treatment period, the median (min; max) duration of study drug treatment 
was 35 (1; 65) days for the DB caplacizumab group and 23 (2; 66) days for the DB placebo group. 
During the OL treatment period >40% of subjects received rituximab. 
During the FU period immunosuppressive medications were taken by a considerably larger fraction of 
subjects in the caplacizumab arm, 75% vs 52% in the placebo group, while rituximab was used by

18% and 25%, respectively. Given the option of OL caplacizumab, considerably more used in the 
placebo arm, these figures are very difficult to interpret.

Figure 8: Time to confirmed platelet response curves (ITT population) 
Subgroup analyses 
The HR for time to platelet count response was  
−  1.59 (1.017-2.473) in subjects with less severe disease and 1.69 (0.936-3.038) in subjects 
with very severe disease;  
−  1.67 (1.025-2.722) in subjects with initial episode of TTP and 1.64 (0.951-2.818) in subjects 
with recurrent episode, and;  
−  1.70 (1.162-2.489) in subjects with ADAMTS13 <10% at baseline and 1.52 (0.469-4.919) in 
subjects with ADAMTS13 ≥10% at baseline. 
As pointed out by the Applicant the results on patients with ADAMTS13 activity ≥10% should be 
interpreted with caution as a diagnosis of aTTP could not be confirmed in 7 of them. 
Based on 66 events in each arm time to confirmed platelet response was statistically significantly 
shorter in the caplacizumab arm, p=0.0099, with a HR of 1.55 (1.095; 2.195). In terms of medians, 
the absolute outcomes as well as the difference between study arms were much smaller than 
anticipated in the sample size calculations, only 0.19 days (2.69 vs 2.88). However, looking at the KM 
graph the median is not informative. Rather, the effect of caplacizumab is noted primarily in “late” 
responders, >3-4 days. Opposed to the phase II study, patients were required to have received one PE 
treatment before randomization, which likely contributed to the shorter times to platelet response 
observed in the phase III study. The result of the primary analysis is supported by various sensitivity 
analyses. The results of the provided subgroup analyses show generally consistent treatment effects.

KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
•  TTP-Related Death, Recurrence of TTP, and Major Thromboembolic Events During the 
Study Drug Treatment Period 
Table 11: 
The outcome of this analysis, p<0.0001, is principally driven by the considerably larger number of 
exacerbations in the placebo arm, 28 vs 3. Regarding at least one treatment-emergent major 
thromboembolic event no difference between study arms was noted. In the caplacizumab group one 
patient died from TTP after the study drug treatment period. 
•  Proportion of subjects with a recurrence of TTP in the overall study period 
The alpha-protected analysis regards proportion of subjects with a recurrence of TTP in the overall 
study period: 38% of subjects in the placebo arm and 13% in the caplacizumab arm, p=0.0004. In the 
placebo arm, all 28 recurrences (exacerbations) occurred during the DB treatment period while in the 
caplacizumab arm, 3 patients had an exacerbation during the DB treatment period and, notably, 6 
subjects relapsed during FU. Again, interpretation of data after the DB period is very difficult due to the 
option of OL caplacizumab. Of note, all patients relapsing during FU had an ADAMTS13 activity level of 
<10% when study drug treatment was ended. 
•  Proportion of subjects with refractory TTP 
The alpha-protected analysis regards proportion of subjects with refractory TTP defined as absence of 
platelet count doubling after 4 days of standard treatment and LDH>ULN: 3 subjects in the placebo 
arm vs 0 in the caplacizumab arm, p=0.0572. 
Using the International Consensus Definition of refractoriness, 5 subjects in the placebo arm vs none in 
the caplacizumab fulfilled the criteria, descriptive p=0.0178.  
•  Time to normalization of all 3 organ damage markers (i.e., LDH, cTnI and serum 
creatinine) for the ITT population 
Median time to normalization of LDH, cTnI and serum creatinine was numerically shorter in the 
caplacizumab arm, 2.86 days vs 3.36 days in the placebo arm. Due to the hierarchical testing 
procedure this analysis should be considered descriptive only.

Median number of days of PE during the overall study drug treatment period was 5 in the caplacizumab 
arm and 7 in the placebo arm, and absolute total volume of PE was 18 and 27 Liters, respectively.  
As a reminder, “the ‘overall treatment period’ corresponds with the treatment analysis phase and 
covers both the double-blind (DB) treatment analysis period and the OL treatment analysis 
period. Note that only subjects who experienced a relapse or exacerbation had an OL 
treatment analysis period. For these subjects, the overall treatment period starts at start of 
DB treatment period and ends at end of OL treatment period. For subjects with no switch to open-label 
caplacizumab, the overall treatment period starts at start of DB treatment period and ends at end of 
DB treatment period”. 
•  Mortality rate 
In the placebo arm, 3 patients died during the daily PE period, all considered TTP-related. In the 
caplacizumab arm, one patient died during FU, also considered TTP-related. 
•  Treatment-emergent major thromboembolic events during the Overall Study Drug 
Treatment Period (ITT population) 
Treatment-emergent major thromboembolic events during the overall study drug period were reported 
in 6 patients in each study arm, mainly DVT and cerebrovascular accident. 
•  Number of days in ICU and hospital during the Overall Study Drug Treatment Period 
(ITT Population) 
The median number of days in the ICU and in hospital during the overall study drug treatment period 
was both numerically lower in the caplacizumab arm, 3 vs 5 and 9 vs 12, respectively. 
ADAMTS13 activity 
At screening, mean (SE) ADAMTS13 activity was 8.37% (2.34) in the caplacizumab group and 7.81% 
(2.40) in the placebo group. 
The confounding of PE on ADAMTS13 activity levels and the high number of patients that switched to 
OL treatment in the placebo group render group-wise comparisons of ADAMTS13 activity levels over 
time largely non-informative. 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 66/88 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, looking at ADAMTS13 activity at the week after end of daily PE in platelet responders (90% 
in the caplacizumab group, 88% in the placebo group) the fraction of subjects reaching activity >10% 
was only slightly higher in the placebo group, 45% vs 38% in the caplacizumab group. This 
information is important as days of daily plasma exchange and plasma exchange volumes were lower 
in the caplacizumab group. 
Of the 3 patients on the caplacizumab arm with an exacerbation one subject was non-compliant with 
therapy while having low ADAMTS13. 
The results of also the HERCULES study emphasises the need for monitoring and further 
immunosuppressive treatment of disease activity (e.g. ADAMTS13 levels). 
Immunogenicity results 
Table 13: Incidences over the different treatment groups, analysis periods and bioanalytical 
methods (Safety Population) 
TE ADA responses and TE Nab detection were noted at higher frequencies in the caplacizumab group 
as compared to placebo, but absolute numbers were low. No influence of pre-Ab or TE ADA on time to 
platelet count response was found. No TE ADA were detected in any of the 3 subjects with 
exacerbation in the caplacizumab arm.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The interpretation of the phase II study results as well as the internal validity of the study must be 
deemed hampered by several issues related to the conduct: the premature termination of the study, a 
high number of important protocol amendments, a relatively large fraction of major protocol violations 
and consequently a small PP population, issues with the local and central laboratories resulting in 
uncertainties regarding the integrity and identity for an unknown number of the samples, missing data, 
with the extent sometimes not clear to the assessor, and a number of the analyses considered 
important analysed post-hoc, and several of the pre-planned and post-hoc ≥secondary outcomes are 
associated with different levels of uncertainties. Therefore, the data from this study was not considered 
adequate to be reflected in the product information. 
In the ALX0681-C301 study any major protocol deviation was reported for 45% of subjects in the 
caplacizumab arm and 43% in the placebo arm with “treatment non-compliance” being the most 
prevalent reason. However, the protocol deviations are not deemed likely to favour the experimental 
arm or to challenge the overall results of the study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Despite the shortcomings associated with the conduct of the phase II study it was considered that 
proof-of-concept has been shown. However, the observation of equal numbers of exacerbation/relapse 
at the 1-month follow-up of that study clearly indicates that the optimal use of the drug was not yet 
established and the limited data on risk-adapted treatment, longer-term treatment and re-treatment 
upon relapse available so far did not allow firm optimised treatment recommendations. Further, robust 
data supporting faster resolution of organ damage secondary to microthrombi was largely lacking. 
Assessment Report

With the submission of the final CSR for the ALX0681-C301 study most of these uncertainties have 
been addressed. While the allowance of disease activity-guided adaptation of immunosuppression and 
the possibility for treatment extension were part of the protocol and clearly diminished the risk for 
recurrence of TTP during the study period in the caplacizumab arm, uncertainties still remain regarding 
treatment of longer duration than investigated in the study (see RMP). 
Further, no data on re-treatment is currently available but this will be addressed in the ongoing 
ALX0681-C302 study (please see RMP).  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The provided efficacy data is deemed sufficient to support a benefit/risk estimation for caplacizumab as 
adjunct to PE and immunosuppressive therapy in the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of 
aTTP. 
In order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of caplacizumab and the safety and efficacy of 
repeated use of caplacizumab in the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTPP), the applicant should submit the results of a phase IIIb 
study (ALX0681-C302).

Table 16: Summary of adverse events by severity in Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 (Safety 
population) 
A higher frequency of mild to moderate TEAEs was registered in the placebo arm. Severe TEAEs were 
reported in a higher proportion in the experimental arm. Notably, assessment of severity was missing 
for 85 cases. 
Overall, bleeding-related TEAEs were numerically more common in the caplacizumab arm, with 19 
patients (54%) vs. placebo, 14 patients (38%). The mild bleeding events were 80% (53/66) for 
caplacizumab and 89% (31/35) for placebo. Those moderate in severity were 17% (11/66) for 
caplacizumab vs 9% (3/35) in the placebo arm.  
The most common bleeding-related TEAEs in the caplacizumab treatment group were epistaxis (31%), 
gingival bleeding (14%), bruising (11%), petechiae (11%), and hematoma (11%), all with mild to 
moderate severity. The most common PTs in the placebo treatment group were epistaxis and 
hematoma, both occurring at an incidence of 11%. 
With the exception of procedural complications (bruising), 11 vs 5%, and epistaxis (31% vs 11%), 
other SOC/PTs that were more frequent in the caplacizumab arm were: gynaecological bleeding (11% 
vs 5%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (17% vs 5%) and haemorrhage/hematoma UNS, 17% 
vs 11% (including one intra-abdominal hematoma for caplacizumab). 
Regarding CNS, one subarachnoid haemorrhage was reported for caplacizumab, and one cerebral 
haemorrhage (fatal) and one haemorrhagic stroke in the placebo arm.  
Two patients experienced a serious bleeding-related TEAE that was considered at least possibly related 
to caplacizumab (subarachnoid haemorrhage and metrorrhagia, respectively). 
The number and proportion of subjects with any immune-related TEAE was higher in the experimental 
group, 17 patients (49%) compared to control: 12 (32%). Most immune-related TEAEs were mild 
(43/65 events [66%]) or moderate (20/65 events [31%]) in severity. 
One subject in the caplacizumab group experienced 2 non-serious episodes of the TEAE of ‘vaccination 
site reaction’ during the PE period which were both considered severe in intensity and unlikely/not 
related to the study drug. In addition, this subject also experienced a serious TEAE of dermatitis 
allergic during the PE period, which was considered moderate in intensity and possibly related to the 
study drug and related to PE. No other serious immune-related TEAEs were reported. 
Transfusion reaction was more commonly reported in the caplacizumab group: 8 events in 4 patients 
vs. 1 reaction in 1 subject in the control arm.

Rash and urticarial were reported in similar fractions between study arms. 
Clinically relevant bleeding 
Most of the clinically relevant bleeding during the first week of daily PE did not require medical or 
surgical intervention, with the exception of one subject (#602-001) in the caplacizumab treatment 
group who required medical intervention for metrorrhagia on Days 5 and 6 of daily PE and one subject 
(#602-006) in the placebo group (Days 18 and 27 of the daily PE period) who required medical 
intervention (esomeprazole) for vomiting blood on Day 18. The event was reported as mild non-serious 
AE that resolved without sequelae.  
During the 30-day post daily PE period, clinically relevant bleeding was reported in 5 subjects in the 
caplacizumab treatment group and 2 subjects in the placebo treatment group. Two subjects required 
medical intervention for bleeding events of epistaxis (#602-003, caplacizumab group) and haematuria 
(#101-003, placebo group). 
No subject in either treatment group had clinically relevant bleeding on Days 3 or 7 or at 1, 2, 3, 6, or 
12 months of follow-up. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious TEAEs were reported in 20 (57.1%) subjects in the caplacizumab treatment group and 19 
(51.4%) subjects in the placebo treatment group. Drug-related SAEs were reported in 7 (20%) of 
caplacizumab patients compared to none in the control arm.  
The outcomes of all SAEs that occurred in patients receiving caplacizumab were reported as recovered 
/ resolved (n=19). The outcome of the SAEs that occurred in patients treated with placebo were 
reported as recovered/resolved (n=17) and as fatal (n=2). 
No TEAEs led to death in the experimental group, while 2 TEAEs resulted in death in the placebo arm, 
both occurring between the end of study drug treatment up to and including 1 month follow-up. 
Laboratory findings 
Mean fibrinogen, aPTT levels, PT levels, and the INR were normal at baseline, on the first day after 
daily PE and at 1, 6, and 12 months follow-up and were similar in both treatment groups. A post-hoc 
analysis of transaminases abnormalities showed no major differences between study arms. Please refer 
to the PK/PD section for a discussion of vWF:Ag and FVIII:C. 
Safety in special populations 
The age of subjects enrolled ranged from 19 to 72 years with a mean of 42 years. Insufficient data are 
available to determine a difference in response in patients over 65 years of age compared to the 
younger patient population. No data in paediatric/adolescent patients (12-18 years) are available. 
No patients with severe acute or chronic renal and/or hepatic impairment were studied. 
Immunological events 
Pre-existing antibodies were detected pre-dose in 13% of the subjects in study ALX-0681-2.1/10. 
Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TE ADA) were detected in 9% of the subjects in the 
caplacizumab treated group and no TE ADA was detected in the placebo treated subjects. It is agreed 
with the Applicant that the immunogenicity in the caplacizumab treated group (pre-Ab and/or TE ADA) 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 76/88 
 
 
  
 
 
had no apparent influence on immune-related adverse events, but numbers of subjects are low and 
aTTP a complex disease. Please also refer to the PK/PD section. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Ongoing chronic treatment with anticoagulant treatment that could not be stopped safely was an 
exclusion criterion. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were numerically higher in the caplacizumab arm, 10 
events in 4 subjects as compared to 2 events in 2 subjects in the control arm. No contributing specific 
PT can be identified to be responsible for the difference. 
AEs leading to interruption of study drug were similar between study arms and noted in 3 patients in 
the caplacizumab arm and 4 patients in the control arm. 
Study ALX681-C301  
Exposure and overview 
Total treatment duration during the DB period was 35 days in the caplacizumab arm and 23 days in 
the placebo arm. This difference should be taken into account when looking at incidence of events. 
During the OL treatment Period, the median duration of OL caplacizumab treatment was 36 days. 
Table 17: Summary table of treatment-emergent adverse events during the Overall Study 
Period (Safety population) 
During the overall study period, SAEs were reported in 39% of subjects in the caplacizumab arm and 
53% of subjects in the placebo arm with 14% and 6%, respectively, considered at least possibly 
treatment-related; TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were reported in 7% and 12%, 
respectively. The frequency of bleeding events considered indicative of an increased bleeding tendency 
was higher in the caplacizumab arm. Note that the figures for bleeding events according to SMQ 
“haemorrhage” are confounded by TTP events. 
Adverse events (overall study period) 
By preferred term, the most frequently reported TEAEs were:  
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 77/88 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura reported in 9 subjects (12.7%) and 29 subjects (39.7%) in 
the DB caplacizumab and DB placebo groups, respectively.  
• Epistaxis reported in 23 subjects (32.4%) and 2 subjects (2.7%) in the DB caplacizumab and DB 
placebo groups, respectively.  
• Headache reported in 16 subjects (22.5%) and 6 subjects (8.2%) in the DB caplacizumab and DB 
placebo groups, respectively. 
TEAEs reported with a higher risk of occurring after treatment with caplacizumab compared to placebo 
were gingival bleeding, epistaxis, and headache. 
TEAEs reported with a lower risk of occurring after treatment with caplacizumab compared to placebo 
were TTP and hypokalaemia. 
During the overall study period severe TEAEs were more commonly reported in the placebo group, 
33% vs 21%. The incidences of moderate headache (7% vs 3%) and epistaxis (7% vs 0%) were 
higher in the caplacizumab group, as was the SOC of infections and infestations (13% vs 7%). 
Consistent with the findings in the phase II study, the safety profile of caplacizumab seems to be 
dominated by mucocutaneous bleeding. 
During the overall study period, removing events of TTP and microangiopathy, treatment-emergent 
SAEs were reported in 19 (27%) subjects in the caplacizumab arm and 9 (12%) patients in the placebo 
arm. The higher frequency of these SAEs in the caplacizumab arm seems to be mainly related to 
bleeding events but also a slightly higher fraction in the cardiac disorders SOC is noted. The latter was 
addressed in Q21: collectively, the PTs and their temporal occurrence are not suggestive of a specific 
pattern or a clear relationship with caplacizumab treatment. The reasons for the imbalance between 
study arms remain obscure. 
During the overall study period, excluding TTP as event, 6% of subjects in the caplacizumab arm and 
10% in the placebo arm discontinued study drug due to AEs; no PT occurred in more than one of these 
patients. 
During the overall study period, treatment-related serious bleeding events were reported for 8 subjects 
(11%) in the DB caplacizumab group and 3 subjects (4%) in the DB placebo group; epistaxis was 
reported in 4 subjects (6%) in the DB caplacizumab group and 0 subjects in the DB placebo group. 
In the placebo arm, 3 patients died during the daily PE period, all considered TTP-related. In the 
caplacizumab arm, one patient died during FU, also considered TTP-related. 
During the overall study period, at least one hypersensitivity reaction was reported in similar fractions 
of the study groups. There were no treatment-related events of drug-induced anaphylaxis in the DB 
caplacizumab group.  
If removing TTP and thrombotic microangiopathy, no major difference between groups in terms of 
treatment-emergent thromboembolic events is noted. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the phase II study, overall, bleeding-related TEAEs were numerically more common in the 
caplacizumab arm, with 19 patients (54%) vs. placebo, 14 patients (38%). Hence, warnings in section 
4.4 of the SmPC have been introduced to recommend that Cablivi treatment should be interrupted in 
case of active, clinically significant bleeding. If needed, the use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate 
Assessment Report  
Cablivi - EMA/490172/2018  
Page 78/88 
 
 
  
 
 
could be considered to correct haemostasis. Cablivi should only be restarted upon the advice of a 
physician experienced in the management of thrombotic microangiopathies.  
In addition, warnings have been introduced to provide recommendations when patients are at an 
increased risk of bleeding (please see section 4.4 of the SmPC), the patient alert card will also provide 
recommendations to this effect (please see RMP).  
The most common adverse reactions were bleeding events: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, Eye 
Haemorrhage, haematemesis, haematochezia, melaena, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal haemorrhage, abdominal wall haematoma, Injection site 
haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, haematuria, menorrhagia, vaginal haemorrhage, 
haemoptysis, haematoma. 
Other most common adverse reactions were pyrexia, fatigue, headache, urticaria, injection site 
reaction, myalgia, injection site pruritus, injection site erythema, cerebral infarction, dyspnoea. 
The mild bleeding events were 80% (53/66) for caplacizumab and 89% (31/35) for placebo. Those 
moderate in severity were 17% (11/66) for caplacizumab vs 9% (3/35) in the placebo arm. It is noted 
that assessment of severity was missing for 85 cases. Two patients experienced a serious bleeding-
related TEAE that was considered at least possibly related to caplacizumab (subarachnoid haemorrhage 
and metrorrhagia, respectively). Serious TEAEs were reported in similar fractions of subjects between 
study arms. The number and proportion of subjects with any immune-related TEAE was higher in the 
experimental group. AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were numerically higher in the 
caplacizumab arm, 10 events in 4 subjects as compared to 2 events in 2 subjects in the control arm. 
No contributing specific PT can be identified to be responsible for the difference. No patient on 
caplacizumab died on treatment. Caplacizumab treatment lowers vWF:Ag levels and FVIII:C but no 
factor concentrates had to be used in the study. 
The safety results also from the ALX0681-C301 study are generally compatible with what could be 
expected from the MoA and mainly consists of von Willebrand disease-like mild to moderate mucosal 
and skin/subcutaneous tissue haemorrhage.  
During the overall study period, treatment-related serious bleeding events were reported for 8 subjects 
(11%) in the DB caplacizumab group and 3 subjects (4%) in the DB placebo group; epistaxis was 
reported in 4 subjects (6%) in the DB caplacizumab group and 0 subjects in the DB placebo group. 
During the overall study period severe TEAEs were more commonly reported in the placebo group. The 
incidences of moderate headache and epistaxis were higher in the caplacizumab group, as was the 
SOC of infections and infestations. 
During the overall study period, excluding TTP as event, 6% of subjects in the caplacizumab arm and 
10% in the placebo arm discontinued study drug due to AEs; no PT occurred in more than one of these 
patients. 
At least one hypersensitivity reaction was reported in similar fractions of the study groups. There were 
no treatment-related events of drug-induced anaphylaxis in the DB caplacizumab group. 
Based on subgroup analyses, no particular risk or safety concern was associated with extending 
treatment. The number and nature of adverse events was generally similar in patients with or without 
treatment extension.  
No data on re-treatment is currently available but this will be addressed in the ongoing ALX0681-C302 
study (please see RMP). In order to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of caplacizumab and the 
safety and efficacy of repeated use of caplacizumab in the treatment of adults experiencing an episode

of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTPP), the MAH should submit the results of a 
phase IIIb study (ALX0681-C302).  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The major safety issue noted with caplacizumab is von Willebrand disease-like mild to moderate 
mucosal and skin/subcutaneous tissue haemorrhage, in accordance with the MoA. Clinically relevant 
bleeding was more commonly reported in the caplacizumab arm, this has been reflected in section 4.4 
of the SmPC where warning have been introduced and a patient alert card will be given to patients 
(please see RMP).  
No data on re-treatment is currently available but this will be addressed in the ongoing ALX0681-C302 
study (please see RMP).  
Overall, the safety profile of the drug seems generally manageable.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that caplacizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers caplacizumab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Cablivi (caplacizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is a biological product that is not 
covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
With current standard therapy, including PE and corticosteroids, and more recently at certain centres 
incorporating also rituximab, an acute mortality of 20% has been reported. Refractoriness to therapy is 
associated with inferior prognosis and increased mortality. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study ALX681-C301: A Phase III double-blind, randomized, parallel group, multicenter placebo-
controlled trial to study the efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in patients with acquired 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Primary endpoint; time to confirmed platelet response 
Based on 66 events in each arm time to confirmed platelet response was statistically significantly 
shorter in the caplacizumab arm, p=0.0099, with a HR of 1.55 (1.095; 2.195). In terms of medians, 
the absolute outcomes as well as the difference between study arms were much smaller than 
anticipated in the sample size calculations, only 0.19 days (2.69 vs 2.88). However, looking at the KM 
graph the median is not informative. Rather, the effect of caplacizumab is noted primarily in “late” 
responders, >3-4 days. Opposed to the phase II study, patients were required to have received one PE 
treatment before randomization, which likely contributed to the shorter times to platelet response 
observed in the phase III study. The result of the primary analysis is supported by various sensitivity 
analyses. The subgroup analyses, addressing HR for time to platelet count response in relation severity 
of disease, initial/recurrent TTP episode and ADAMTS13 level show generally consistent treatment 
effects. 
Treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a 74% reduction in the composite endpoint of the percentage 
of patients with aTTP-related death (0/72; placebo 3/73), exacerbation of aTTP (3/72; placebo 28/73), 
or at least one major thromboembolic event during study drug treatment (6/72; placebo 6/73) 
(p<0.0001). There were no deaths in the caplacizumab group and 3 deaths in the placebo group 
during the study drug treatment period. 
Treatment with caplacizumab reduced the mean number of days of plasma exchange, the volume of 
plasma used, the mean length of Intensive Care Unit stay and the mean length of hospitalization 
during the study drug treatment period (see effects table). 
The results of the ALX681-C301 study also emphasise the need for monitoring (e.g. ADAMTS13 
activity) and further immunosuppressive treatment of persistent disease activity (please see section 
4.2 of the SmPC). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data from study ALX-0681-2.1/10 were not considered adequate to be reflected in the product 
information due to limitations with regards to the conduct of the study.  
Uncertainties still remain regarding the benefit-risk in treatment of longer duration than investigated in 
the study. Further, no data on re-treatment is currently available but will be addressed in the ongoing 
ALX0681-C302 study. Hence, in order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of caplacizumab 
and the safety and efficacy of repeated use of caplacizumab in the treatment of adults experiencing an 
episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTPP), the MAH should submit the results 
of a phase IIIb study (ALX0681-C302) (see RMP).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse reactions were bleeding events: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, eye 
haemorrhage, haematemesis, haematochezia, melaena, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal haemorrhage, abdominal wall haematoma, Injection site 
haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, haematuria, menorrhagia, vaginal haemorrhage, 
haemoptysis, haematoma. 
Hence, warnings in section 4.4 of the SmPC have been introduced to provide recommendation that 
Cablivi treatment should be interrupted case of active, clinically significant bleeding. If needed, the use 
of von Willebrand Factor concentrate could be considered to correct haemostasis. Cablivi should only

be restarted upon the advice of a physician experienced in the management of thrombotic 
microangiopathies.  
In addition, warnings have been introduced to provide recommendations when patients are at an 
increased risk of bleeding (please see section 4.4 of the SmPC) and a patient alert card will also 
provide recommendations to this effect. 
Other most common adverse reactions were pyrexia, fatigue, headache, urticaria, injection site 
reaction, myalgia, injection site pruritus, injection site erythema, cerebral infarction, dyspnoea. 
TE ADA responses and TE Nab detection were noted at higher frequencies in the caplacizumab group 
as compared to placebo, but absolute numbers were low. No influence of pre-Ab or TE ADA on time to 
platelet count response was found. No TE ADA were detected in any of the 3 subjects with 
exacerbation in the caplacizumab arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties still remain regarding the safety of longer duration than investigated in the studies, as 
well as due to the relatively small size of the safety database in the target population (n=72 in the 
ALX681-C301 study and 35 in the ALX-0681-2.1/10 study). Hence, in order to evaluate the long-term 
efficacy and safety of caplacizumab and the safety and efficacy of repeated use of caplacizumab in the 
treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTPP), 
the MAH should submit the results of a phase IIIb study (ALX0681-C302). The 3 years follow-up study 
will be informative for further characterisation of the safety profile of caplacizumab (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Data are deemed sufficiently robust to support a B/R estimation for caplacizumab as adjunct to PE and 
immunosuppressive therapy in the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of aTTP.  
With the addition of caplacizumab to current standard of care the substantial reduction in the risk for 
aTTP recurrence, noted also during the overall study period, is, for obvious reasons, deemed to 
constitute an important clinical outcome. However, concomitant monitoring, e.g. for ADAMTS13 
activity, and optimized immunosuppressive treatment of persistent disease activity are prerequisites 
for optimal use of the drug. 
The phase III study failed to show superiority in terms of time to normalisation of the 3 selected tissue 
markers, although the median time was numerically shorter in the caplacizumab arm, and no 
difference in terms of treatment-emergent major thromboembolic events was noted between study 
arms. Nevertheless, a shorter time to platelet response is considered of clinical relevance as it reduces 
the time at the highest risk for morbidity and leads to shorter primary exposure to PE and the 
procedure-associated risks.  
The clinical relevance of the two efficacy outcomes discussed above, reduction in the risk for aTTP 
recurrence and shorter time to platelet response, is supported by numerically shorter median number 
of days in ICU and hospital, shorter median number of days of PE and lower absolute total volume of 
PE, all during the overall study period, in the phase III caplacizumab arm. Looking at the DB daily PE 
period, 3 patients died in the placebo group and none in the caplacizumab group, all considered TTP-
related.

The most important safety issue noted with caplacizumab is von Willebrand disease-like mild to 
moderate mucosal and skin/subcutaneous tissue haemorrhage, in accordance with the MoA. Although 
relatively uncommon, clinically relevant bleeding was noted with caplacizumab. Generally, the safety 
profile of the drug is deemed manageable.  
In order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of caplacizumab and the safety and efficacy of 
repeated use of caplacizumab in the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTPP), the MAH should submit the results of a phase IIIb study 
(ALX0681-C302) (please see RMP).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits are considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cablivi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Cablivi is favourable in the following indication: 
Cablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

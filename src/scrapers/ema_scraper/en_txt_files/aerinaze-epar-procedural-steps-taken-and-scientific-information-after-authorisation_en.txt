on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Aerinaze continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Aerinaze continues to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommends the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Aerinaze for unlimited validity.

opinion via written procedure, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Zinplava, intended for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The 
applicant for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. 
Zinplava will be available as a 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The active substance of 
Zinplava is bezlotoxumab, a human monoclonal antitoxin antibody that binds with high affinity to

The benefits with Zinplava are its ability to prevent the recurrence of C. difficile infection diarrhoea 
episodes in the 12 weeks after treatment. The most common side effects following infusion are nausea, 
pyrexia and headache.  
The full indication is:  
"Zinplava is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in adults at 
high risk for recurrence of CDI (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).”

characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been

1.  Assessment 
Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Submission of study MRV02C in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as 
amended and as part of follow up measure 026  
Study MRV02C is an open-label randomised, comparative, multi-centre study to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and safety of a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad manufactured with rHA administered to 
healthy children from 9 months of age. 
Please note that this study was already submitted for M-M-RVAXPRO in the context of variation II/024 
to extend the age indication. 
Assessment 
Study MRV02C is an open-label, randomised, comparative, multi-centre study designed to demonstrate 
that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad manufactured with rHA administered at a 3 month interval to 
different age groups of healthy children at the time of the first dose is non-inferior in terms of antibody 
response rates. The study was conducted in 3 countries (Finland, Germany, France) between 
November 2007 and December 2008. 
In this phase 3b study, a total of 1,620 subjects were randomised in one of 3 groups (1:1:1; 540 
subjects per group), to receive 2 doses of ProQuad manufactured with rHA at a 3-month interval. The 
same interval of time was to be respected between Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad in each group in 
order to solely evaluate the impact of the vaccination age on a unique vaccination pattern.  
The schedule of vaccinations and blood sample collections is shown in Table 1. Blood samples were 
obtained from subjects just prior to ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 1), 42 days (±14) after 
ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 2), and 42 days (±14) after ProQuad dose 2 vaccination 
(blood sample 3).

Vaccine 
ProQuad (manufactured with rHA) is a combined attenuated live virus vaccine for vaccination against 
measles, mumps, rubella and varicella viruses. It is a lyophilised vaccine powder and solvent for 
suspension for injection and stored in separate vials at 2°C-8°C.  
Study objectives 
The objectives of study MRV02C were as follows:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The first primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered 
at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as 
immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1, in terms of 
antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2. 
The second primary objective, which was to be evaluated only if the first primary objective was 
reached, was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3-month 
interval to healthy children of 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as immunogenic as in 
healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1, in terms of antibody response 
rates to measles, mumps, rubella and to varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2.  
The third primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad 
administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age and 9 months of 
age at the time of Dose 1 is well tolerated compared to healthy children of 12 months of age at 
the time of Dose 1.  
The secondary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the antibody titres to measles, 
mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad administered 
to healthy children from 9 months of age.  
The secondary safety objectives were to evaluate the safety profile of Dose 1 and Dose 2 of 
ProQuad administered to healthy children from 9 months of age.

The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the antibody response rates, which were defined 
as: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Measles antibody titre >=255 mIU/ml in subjects with baseline titre <255 mIU/ml. 
Mumps antibody titre >=10 ELISA Ab units/ml in subjects with baseline titre <10 ELISA Ab 
units/ml. 
Rubella antibody titre >=10 IU/ml in subjects with baseline titre <10 IU/ml. 
Varicella antibody titre >=5 gpELISA units/ml 
Serology Assays 
The serology assays were conducted at Merck Research Laboratories (MRL) and PPD, Vaccines and 
Biologics, U.S.A.  
Antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella were determined by validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and antibodies to varicella were determined by glycoprotein enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA).  
The serostatus cut-off of the measles ELISA was 255 mIU/ml. The basis for the cut-off was a review of 
the literature in which the calculated result for the seroprotective antibody level expressed in mIU/ml 
(when compared to the World Health Organization reference standard) was reported as 255 mIU/ml. 
The serostatus cut-off used for the mumps ELISA was determined as the lowest antibody concentration 
that was distinguishable from a panel of 72 ‚negative’ samples. 
For rubella the serostatus cut-off for the assay was based on the WHO standard.  
The cut-off used in the varicella gpELISA assay was internally defined as 1.25 gpELISA units/ml. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of 
the study vaccine and with any post vaccination immunogenicity evaluation. 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was defined as all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol 
violations which may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation. 
Two subsets of the Per Protocol Set were defined for the immunogenicity evaluation at the 
corresponding time point, i.e.: 
− 
PPS1 consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which 
may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 1. 
PPS2 consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which 
may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 2. 
Analysis of the immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity analysis of the primary criteria was performed on the PPS in initially seronegative 
subjects (main analysis) and on the FAS (supportive analysis). 
Assessment Report under Article 46 
EMA/639014/2014  
Page 4/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the Per Protocol analysis, only initially seronegative subjects were included in the analyses of the 
corresponding valence: 
• 
• 
For measles, subjects with baseline (BS1) measles antibody titres <255 mIU/mL (i.e. initially 
seronegative to measles), 
For mumps, subjects  
•  with baseline (BS1) mumps antibody titres <10.0 ELISA Ab units/mL (i.e. initially seronegative 
to mumps), 
• 
• 
For rubella, subjects with baseline (BS1) rubella antibody titres <10.0 IU/mL (i.e. initially 
seronegative to rubella), 
For varicella, subjects with baseline (BS1) varicella antibody titres <1.25 gpELISA units/mL 
(i.e. initially seronegative to varicella). 
The immunogenicity analysis of the secondary criteria was performed on both PPS in initially 
seronegative subjects and FAS. Also, descriptive statistics were provided on initially seropositive 
subjects at inclusion, if seropositive subjects represent at least 5% of the FAS.  
All subjects with serology results following Dose 2 of ProQuad were included in the FAS whatever 
antibody titres at baseline (BS1). 
In relation with the first primary hypothesis, the estimates of the between groups differences in 
response rates (Group 2 - Group 3) were calculated together with their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower 
bounds of the CI were greater than –5% for measles, mumps and rubella response rates and greater 
than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the Group 2 response rates are non-
inferior to the Group 3 response rates. 
If the first primary objective was reached, the second primary hypothesis was tested. The estimates of 
the between groups differences in response rates (Group 1 - Group 3) were calculated together with 
their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower bounds of the CI were greater than –5% for measles, mumps and 
rubella response rates and greater than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the 
Group 1 response rates are non-inferior to the Group 3 response rates. 
Assessor’s comment: The non-inferiority margins were appropriately defined. 
Results 
Disposition of subjects 
A total of 1,626 subjects were enrolled between 29 November 2007 and 14 April 2008. Six subjects 
were not randomised either due to protocol deviation or due to other reasons. 
Randomised subjects were enrolled in three countries: 1,290 subjects (79.6%) into 15 centres in 
Finland, 140 subjects (8.6%) into 14 centres in France, and 190 subjects (11.7%) into 19 centres in 
Germany. 
A total of 161 subjects (9.9%) were withdrawn from the study. The majority of subjects (137; 8.5%) 
were withdrawn before first vaccination, 18 subjects (1.1%) between first and second vaccination and 
six subjects (0.4%) after receiving the second vaccine dose. Given the differences in time between 
randomisation and first vaccination in the 3 groups, and taken into account in the determination of the 
Assessment Report under Article 46 
EMA/639014/2014  
Page 5/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
sample size, the number of subjects withdrew from the study before Dose 1 was higher in Group 2 
(first dose at 11 months) and Group 3 (first dose at 12 months), 10.4% and 12.8% of subjects 
respectively, than in Group 1 (first dose at 9 months), 2.2% of subjects. 
The main reason for withdrawal was for personal reason but 3 subjects were withdrawn for adverse 
event: 1 subject (15073) from Group 3 before Dose 1 (viral infection), and 2 subjects from Group 1 
after Dose 1 due to serious adverse events assessed by the investigator as non-related to study 
vaccine (subject 05100 for convulsion 2 months after vaccination and subject 15027 for gastroenteritis 
rotavirus). 
The Full Analysis Set consisted of 1,473 subjects (90.9%): 527 subjects in Group 1, 480 subjects in 
Group 2 and 466 subjects in Group 3. 
The PPS consisted of 1,446 subjects (89.3%) and the PPS1 consisted of 1,426 subjects (88.0%) 
including 519 subjects in Group 1, 460 subjects in Group 2 and 447 subjects in Group 3.  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable between groups except for gender: 
Groups 1 and 2 were constituted of 48% of boys and 52% of girls whereas in Group 3, the gender 
distribution was 52% of boys and 48% of girls. Overall, mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) age at 
inclusion was 9.48 (+/-0.30) months, mean weight was 9.22 (+/-1.14) kg, and mean height was 
72.96 (+/-2.64) cm. 
At first vaccination, mean (+/- SD) age was 9.51 months (+/-0.30) in Group 1, 11.26 months (+/- 
0.23) in Group 2, and 12.32 months (+/-0.24) in Group 3. 
Regarding the serostatus at baseline, the percentage of subjects considered seropositive for measles, 
mumps and rubella at the time of first vaccination was comparable in the 3 groups (Table 2). For 
varicella the percentage of seropositive subjects decreased with increasing age indicating the 
persistence of maternal antibodies.

(a) Non-inferiority is achieved since the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
is above -5% for measles, mumps, and rubella and above -10% for varicella. 
Assessor’s comment: The data clearly demonstrate that vaccination of infants 9 months of age 
results in lower response rates to the measles component. This observation is most likely due to 
circulating maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune system of the children. These results 
confirm that a further dose of vaccine should be given later on as catch-up to ensure high 
seroprotection rates against measles.

Assessor’s comment: For measles, a significant difference in the response rates and GMTs in 
baseline seronegative children is observed depending on the age of administration of the vaccine dose.  
Moreover the increase in antibody titers post dose 2 was highest in the youngest age category 
compared to Group 2 and 3. In group 1, an increase from 942 mIU/ml after the first dose to 
1817 mIU/ml after the second dose was observed, which is still lower than the GMT reported after the 
first dose in older infants. This low response might be due to interfering low circulating maternal 
antibodies or the immaturity of the immune system.  
In summary the post dose 1 and 2 responses are significantly lower in children 9 months of age than in 
infants 11 or 12 months of age. These results corroborate the necessity of further vaccine doses, when 
children are vaccinated in their first year of life against measles. Clear advice on the administration of 
further doses should be provided in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Antibody response in initially seropostive subjects 
Response rates and geometric means of measles, mumps, and rubella antibody titres at 6 weeks post-
Dose 1 and post-Dose 2 on antigen specific FAS in initially seropositive subjects were presented in the 
CSR. As regards measles 11 subjects in group 1 were found to be seropositive prior vaccination 
(≥255mUI/ml). Following vaccination a very heterogeneous immune response against measles was 
observed within and across the different groups (see below Table 9).

Assessor’s comment: All subjects in group 2 and 3, who were seropositive for measles (titre >255 
mIU/ml) prior vaccination had also a measles antibody titre >255 mIU/ml post dose 2. Only 81.9% of 
infants 9 months of age however were determined to have seroprotective antibody titers post dose 2. 
Although the number of subjects in this subgroup analysis is very low these results suggest 
interference of maternal antibodies on the immune response to measles vaccination.

The Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and 
who had safety follow-up data. Subjects were analysed according to their real age at Dose 1. Subjects 
with an age outside group definitions were reallocated to the group with a closer age definition.

Adverse events 
Post dose 1: 
In total, 81.3% of subjects in Group 1, 81.9% in Group 2 and 81.1% in Group 3 reported at least one 
injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 1. Most of 
these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site 
adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 58.7% of subjects in Group 1, 60.8% in 
Group 2 and 63.9% in Group 3.  
Regarding fever, 8.8%, 10.3% and 14.8% of subjects reported rectal temperature ≥39.4°C in Groups 
1, 2 and 3, respectively following the first dose of ProQuad, i.e. statistically more in Group 3 (first 
injection at 12 months) compared to Group 1 (first injection at 9 months) and Group 2 (first injection 
at 11 months). 
Post dose 2: 
In total, 72.5% of subjects in Group 1, 75.7% in Group 2 and 72.7% in Group 3 reported at least one 
injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 2. Most of 
these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site 
adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 55.0% of subjects in Group 1, 57.8% in 
Group 2 and 54.8% in Group 3.  
As regards the occurrence of fever comparable number of subjects reported rectal temperature 
≥39.4°C in the three groups following the second dose. 
In summary the incidence and intensity of injection-site adverse reactions from Day 0 to Day 28 post-
dose 1 and post dose 2 was comparable between groups. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Before the first administration of ProQuad, no serious adverse event was reported in Group 1, 
1 serious adverse event was reported by 1 subject (0.2%) in Group 2 (gastroenteritis rotavirus), and 
10 serious adverse events were reported by 7 subjects (1.5%) in Group 3 (bronchitis, gastroenteritis, 
laryngitis and concussion were reported by 1 subject each and gastroenteritis rotavirus, otitis media 
and tonsillitis were reported by 2 subjects each). 
Serious adverse events occurring between the Dose 1 and 2 of ProQuad were more frequently reported 
by subjects from Group 1 (3.4%) than those from Group 2 and Group 3 (1.7% in each group). Serious 
adverse events included cardiac disorders, infections and infestations (mainly gastroenteritis rotavirus, 
gastroenteritis and bronchitis), injury, poisoning and procedural complications, nervous system 
disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
No serious adverse event occurring between Dose 1 and 2 or reported after the second dose were 
assessed by neither the investigator nor the sponsor to be related to the study vaccine. 
No death was reported during the course of the study. 
Assessor’s comment: The safety profile is comparable across the different age groups following the 
first and second vaccination with ProQuad, indicating that in principle no safety concern is anticipated 
by vaccinating children from 9 months of age onwards.

2.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion And further action if 
required 
The immunogenicity data from study MRV02C investigating a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (MMRV with 
rHA) in different age groups support the extension of the age indication to children from 9 months of 
age onwards under special circumstances, i.e. outbreak control. The data clearly indicate however that 
vaccination of infants at 9 months of age results in lower antibody responses especially as regards 
measles. The lower antibody responses are most likely due to interfering pre-existing maternal 
antibodies or the immaturity of the immune response of these children. Therefore additional vaccine 
doses are warranted later on in life. However no information on the effect of an additional dose of a 
measles containing vaccine to the primary immunisation course of ProQuad is currently available. As 
regards safety the incidence and intensity of adverse reactions was comparable in infants 9 months of 
age with infants 12 months of age.  
Since it is favourable that measles containing vaccines are available for children from 9 months of age 
onwards to be used under special circumstances e.g. outbreak control, the MAH is asked to update the 
product information in that respect. It should however be made clear that the extended use has to 
follow official national recommendations.    
Please note that the results of this study were already considered to extend the age indication of M-M-
RVAXPRO (variation II/024). 
PAC No. P46 026 
Overall Conclusion: 
  PAC fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) but further action required 
  PAC not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required: 
As outcome of this assessment, the MAH is requested to update the Product Information as follows and 
to submit the corresponding variation by Q3/2010. 
Extend of the age indication to children from 9 months of age under special circumstances.

Marketing authorisation procedure  
Brief description of the product: 
Centralised 
Chemical class 
Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine 
Summary of mode of action 
Abrysvo contains two recombinant stabilised RSV prefusion F 
antigens representing subgroups RSV-A and RSV-B. 
Prefusion F is the primary target of neutralising antibodies that 
block RSV infection. Following intramuscular administration, 
the prefusion F antigens elicit an immune response, which 
protects against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease. 
In infants born to mothers who were vaccinated with Abrysvo 
between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation, protection against RSV-
associated lower respiratory tract disease is due to transplacental 
transfer of RSV neutralising antibodies. Adults 60 years of age 
and older are protected by active immunisation. 
Important information about its composition 
RSVpreF is a solution for injection that consists of equal 
amounts of two stabilised RSV F antigens, denoted 847A and 
847B, representing the two major subgroups A and B, 
respectively. The RSVpreF vaccine presentation is designed to 
deliver a 60 μg dose of each prefusion protein antigen, 
equivalent to 120 μg dose of total protein in a 0.5 mL injection. 
The drug product is supplied in a 2 mL clear glass vial. Prior to 
use, the lyophilised drug product is reconstituted with sterile 
water solvent in a single-use prefilled syringe using a vial 
adapter and the entire content is withdrawn to enable a dose of 
0.5 mL for intramuscular administration. After reconstitution, 
RSVpreF contains trometamol, trometamol hydrochloride, 
sucrose, mannitol, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and water for injections.

PART II. SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population (s) 
Indication 
Respiratory syncytial virus bivalent stabilised prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF) is 
indicated for: 
•  Maternal immunisation during pregnancy to provide protection in infants from birth 
through 6 months of age against lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV).  
•  Active immunisation of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of 
lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. 
SI.1. Indication for maternal immunisation  
Maternal immunisation during pregnancy to provide protection in infants from birth 
through 6 months of age against lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV).  
A literature review was conducted to evaluate the epidemiology of RSV in Europe and the 
United States.  PubMed was searched in October 2022 to identify primary research articles 
published between January 2022-October 2022 and systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
published between January 2017 and October 2022.  The literature search was conducted 
using key words such as incidence and prevalence combined with terms representing RSV.  
Inclusion of articles was limited to those with data on the paediatric population under age 5 
years.  
Iterative, unstructured searches of PubMed and Google were further conducted to obtain 
additional information on aspects of RSV epidemiology that were not adequately captured by 
the initial PubMed searches (e.g., from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
[CDC], and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC]).  Important 
citations referenced within review articles and meta-analyses were also obtained when 
relevant.  
Since public health measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily 
disrupted the transmission and incidence patterns for other infectious diseases2F
epidemiologic data collected between March 2020 and October 2022 were excluded.

Incidence 
•  Global 
A recent estimate of the global burden of RSV infections in paediatric subjects under 5 
(excluding 5-year-olds) comes from a 2022 systematic review by the RSV Global 
Epidemiology Network. 4F
December 31, 2020 from around the world and 51 unpublished population-based studies, 
drawing on far more data than they had done in similar, previous estimates.5F
3  They included 430 studies published between January 1, 1995 and 
5   The authors 
4,
6F
Page 11 
 
 
estimated that, globally for the year 2019, there were 33.0 million episodes of acute lower 
respiratory infections of RSV in paediatric subjects under age 5 years.  They also noted that 5 
countries collectively account for 43% of the world’s paediatric RSV cases under 5: India, 
China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Indonesia, 5 and that incidence of RSV-associated acute 
respiratory infection peaks between the ages of 0 months to 3 months in lower- and middle- 
income countries, but between the ages of 3 months and 6 months in upper middle-income 
and high-income countries.3  
•  US and Europe 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that RSV is responsible 
for 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000 hospitalisations annually among paediatric 
6  In a prospective population-based surveillance study 
subjects under 5 years old in the US.7F
conducted in 2000-04 of 5,067 US paediatric subjects under 5 who went to the hospital or an 
outpatient visit for an acute respiratory infection, Hall et al. found that 919 (18%) of them 
7  The proportion was consistent across different care 
were infected specifically with RSV.8F
settings, as RSV accounted for 20% of hospitalisations, 18% of emergency room visits, and 
15% of outpatient visits.  Among RSV cases who were typed, across all 4 years, 80% were 
RSV-A, 18% RSV-B, and 2% had both strains; RSV-A predominated over RSV-B in 3 of the 
4 seasons across 2000-04.  During the 2015-16 RSV season, Rha et al. conducted a study 
similar to the one Hall conducted a decade earlier, this time of 1,043 US paediatric subjects 
under 5 who were hospitalised with at least one of various acute respiratory infections.  Rha 
et al. found that the proportion of acute respiratory infections that turned out to be RSV 
specifically was highest in December (52%), January (52%), and February (47%) and lowest 
in June (4%). 9F
8 
For a study in a US commercially-insured population using the MarketScan database for 
years 2008-14, Tong et al. analysed 427,289 cases of RSV, 79% of which were under age 5 
9  For young paediatric subjects, 
years, requiring medical attention (hospital or outpatient).10F
they found the following annual average rates of RSV cases requiring medical attention per 
1,000 population per year: 79.0 for age under 1 year, 40.3 for 1-year-olds, and 14.1 for 2-4-
year-olds. 
In their systematic review of severe RSV in young paediatric subjects and infants in the US, 
Canada, and Europe, Bont et al. found that RSV accounted for 12–63% of all acute 
respiratory infections, and 19–81% of acute viral respiratory infections, causing 
hospitalisation in this population.11F
hospital in Spain also reported that RSV accounted for a large proportion of medically 
attended respiratory infections: 47.3% for ages 0-<6 months, 35.6% for ages 6-12 months, 
26.4% for ages 1-2 years, and 13.9% for ages 3-5 years. 12F
10  Another study of paediatric patients at a tertiary referral 
11   
Additional data from the systematic review by Bont et al. found that, while vulnerable 
subgroups such as preterm infants are at elevated risk of severe RSV infections, over 70% of 
young paediatric subjects hospitalised for RSV had no underlying medical conditions. 10  
Overall, the studies reviewed suggested that 75-90% of infants hospitalised with RSV were 
aged under 12 months, including 44-83% aged under 6 months.  In the first year of life, 
annual hospitalisation rates for RSV infections ranged from 3.2-42.7 RSV hospitalisations 
Page 12 
 
 
per 1,000 infants per year.  For ages 1-4 years, annual hospitalisation rates decreased to 0.6-
1.78 RSV hospitalisations per 1,000 infants per year.  Similar hospitalisation rates were 
reported in the Norwegian Enhanced Paediatric Immunization Surveillance (NorEPIS) 
network.  In this study, those aged 0-12 months had an average estimated inpatient 
admissions rate of 9.9 (95% CI: 9.4-10.4) RSV admissions per 1,000 infants per viral season, 
while those aged 1-4 years had an average estimated inpatient admissions rate of 1.8 (95% 
CI: 1.8-1.9) RSV admissions per 1,000 paediatric patients per viral season.13F
12  
Anderson et al. provided estimates of incidence of severe RSV infection for vulnerable 
subgroups of preterm winter births. 44  They conducted a pooled analysis of 7 studies with a 
total of 7,820 infants born at 33-35 weeks’ gestational age (wGA, i.e. preterm) during RSV 
seasons between 2000-14, including 267 infants who were hospitalised for RSV.  Of the 7 
studies, 4 were European, 1 was US, 1 Canadian, and 1 a mostly European international 
study.  Across the studies, the incidence rates for preterm babies ranged from 3.15-5.92 
hospitalisations per 100 patient-seasons.  In the pooled analysis, 33–35 wGA infants born 
and hospitalised within the same RSV season experienced RSV-induced hospitalisation at the 
rate of 4.52 hospitalisations/100 patient-seasons. 
•  Seasonality 
RSV seasonality has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the near 
disappearance of disease during strict quarantine periods and followed by a strong resurgence 
outside of traditional seasonal timeframes.  The lack of population level exposure to RSV 
during the pandemic has led to a suspected “immunity debt”, leaving infants potentially even 
more vulnerable to medically significant disease because they did not gain protective, 
neutralising RSV antibodies through their mothers during pregnancy.14F
15 
14, 
13, 
16F
15F
RSV seasonality patterns before COVID-19 pandemic are summarised here.  A systematic 
review stated that the incidence of RSV infection is strongly associated with the winter 
season, with a general pattern of the RSV seasonal peak preceding the corresponding 
16  For the US during July 2014 through July 2017 
influenza seasonal peak by 6-8 weeks. 17F
(3 RSV seasons), the CDC reported that the median RSV onset occurred at week 41 (mid-
October) and lasted 31 weeks until week 18 (early May), with the median national peak of 
RSV incidence occurring at week 5 (early February).18F
2014-17 RSV seasons occurred approximately 2 weeks earlier than the analogous onset 
estimates for the 2012-14 seasons, and that in 2012-14 RSV detection was done using 
antigen data while in 2014-17 laboratories used polymerase chain reaction-based detection.  
This suggests that the kind of RSV detection assay used influences detection of RSV cases 
and hence RSV surveillance. 
17  The CDC noted that the onsets of the 
There is regional variability in RSV burden and seasonality across the US, with an elevated 
RSV burden in Florida.  For the 2016-17 season, across US Health and Human Services 
regions except Florida, RSV season onset across the country began between mid-September 
and mid-November; peaked between late-December and mid-February; and ended between 
mid-April and mid-May. 6,17  By comparison to the rest of the country, Florida's RSV season 
began earlier and lasted longer. 17  Tong et al. conducted a study of the MarketScan database 
of US commercially-insured individuals that reported annual rates of RSV health care 
Page 13 
 
 
utilization for over 40 million registrants during the 2008-14 observation period. 9  They 
found that, regionally, the South consistently had the greatest burden of RSV across all ages 
(annual range: 43-54%), followed by the North Central region (annual range: 18-23%).  
Although these regional figures are across all ages, Tong et al. noted that of all RSV cases in 
the database for the observation period, paediatric subjects under 5 accounted for 79%, 
including 46% solely by infants under 1 year of age.  Since paediatric subjects under 5 are 
such a large proportion of RSV cases in the database, the overall regional pattern likely 
applies to paediatric subjects under 5 as well. 
For Europe, Broberg et al. used European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC) data to estimate peak RSV seasonality for 15 European countries for the seasons 
18  Across countries, the length of the RSV season in weeks was similar 
spanning 2010-16.19F
based on sentinel (median 16, range 9-24) and non-sentinel (median 18, range 8-24) 
surveillance.  The peak weeks for RSV detections were likewise similar by both sentinel 
(median week 4, range 48-11) and non-sentinel (week 4.5, range 49-17) approaches.  RSV 
detections peaked later, and seasons lasted longer with increasing latitude. 
Prevalence 
Globally, it has been estimated that about 60-70% of paediatric subjects have been infected 
with RSV by age 1 years, with 2-3% of them hospitalised for it, and that nearly all paediatric

of RSV infection in paediatric subjects aged 5 and under were found.  Given the acute nature 
of the disease, any estimates of point prevalence would be similar to estimates of incidence, 
which may explain the lack of attention to point prevalence.

In a meta-analysis of 51 studies (28 European, 12 US) of respiratory viruses in paediatric 
subjects under age 2 years with bronchiolitis diagnosed between October 1999 and December 
2017, RSV was the most commonly detected virus at 59.2% (95% CI 54.7%, 63.6%), far 
more common than the second-most prevalent viral agent (Rhinovirus, 19.3%).21F

For paediatric subjects under 5 years old, Table 1 presents age distributions from several 
primary studies.  Note that all these studies are for paediatric subjects with severe RSV 
infections, i.e., infections requiring hospitalisation or an outpatient visit.  Thus, these age 
distributions may not be identical to the distributions for all RSV infections (mild and 
severe).  No published age distribution data for all RSV infections were identified.

that paediatric subjects in the US and Europe are at greatest risk of severe RSV infection in 
the first year of life, especially in the first 6 months.  More specifically, across the studies in 
Table 1, paediatric subjects less than 1 year old account for 58-89% of RSV cases requiring 
medical attention among paediatric subjects under 5 years old, including paediatric subjects 
under 6 months accounting for 51-58% of RSV cases requiring medical attention among 
paediatric subjects under 5.

of severe infection, that is, infection requiring medical attention.  For paediatric subjects 
under 5 years old, Table 2 presents gender distributions from several primary studies in terms 
of the percentage of cases who were male.  Most of the studies suggest males having a 
slightly increased risk of severe infection compared to females, with males being about 55% 
of severe cases.  The pattern persists across different countries and methods of detecting RSV 
cases.  The study by Hall et al. is an exception, with males having a slightly lower risk of 
severe RSV infection than females.  While the difference between the Hall study and the 
others is not especially large, one contributor to the difference could be the range of RSV 
seasons, with the Hall study restricted to the early 2000s and the other studies taking place 
partly or entirely at later periods.  Different conditions across different seasons might 
influence infection patterns.

different ways, making their distributions not directly comparable.  Nevertheless, the data 
suggest that African American paediatric subjects have an elevated risk of severe RSV 
infection: despite African Americans being less than 15% of the US population,25F
for the Hispanic stratum in the Rha study, African American paediatric subjects accounted 
for about 25-39% of RSV cases requiring medical attention.

2001 study comparing RSV-specific infant hospitalisation rates from the US National

reported 27.4 hospitalisations per 1,000 infants aged <1 year in the general US population, 
but 34.4 hospitalisations per 1,000 AIAN infants aged <1 year. 29 Differences in 
hospitalisation rates were most pronounced for AIAN infants from Alaska (70.9 per 1,000) 
and the Southwest (48.2 per 1,000).29  A 2009-2011 study comparing RSV-specific infant 
hospitalisation rates from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample to rates from the Indian 
Health Services Inpatient Dataset reported similar patterns in incidence. 30  Overall, there 
were 16.6 annual RSV-specific hospitalisations per 1,000 infants aged <1 year in the general 
US population compared to 22.1 annual RSV specific hospitalisations per 1,000 AIAN 
infants aged <1 year. 30  Once again, the rates were even higher for AIAN infants in Alaska 
(43.1 per 1,000 infants per year) and the Southwest (25.4 per 1,000 infants per year).30  
Individual studies of the Navajo and White Mountain Apache population and the Alaskan 
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Region population also reported high RSV-specific hospitalisation 
rates among infants aged <1 year, with a 1997-2000 annual incidence rate of 91 per 1,000 
infants in the Navajo and White Mountain Apache population, 27 and 1993-2012 annual 
incidence rates ranging from 53 per 1,000 infants to 249 per 1,000 infants in the Alaskan

Risk Factors 
•  Overall Infection 
The literature mentions several risk factors that appear to elevate risk of overall infection 
with RSV.  If, as suggested earlier, “most” or “nearly all” paediatric subjects are infected 
with RSV at least once by age 2 years, then risk factors for overall incidence of RSV 
infection may need to be interpreted with caution or considered only weakly predictive.  In 
their retrospective cohort study of German paediatric subjects under 5 hospitalised for RSV, 
Cai et al. identify as risk factors for RSV infection being less than 1 year old, respiratory 
32  While these factors 
disorders, and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period.33F
may be especially salient for severe cases of RSV infection, it is plausible that they increased 
risk of overall RSV infection (mild or severe) because such individuals have weakened 
immune systems. 
•  Severe Infection 
Publications have placed more emphasis on identifying risk factors for severe RSV 
infections.  Although there is no universally accepted definition of severe RSV infection, 10 a 
common definition in the literature seems to be an infection requiring hospitalisation.  While 
many risk factors for severe disease have been proposed, and some may explain demographic 
disparities in RSV-specific hospitalisation, 25,31,26 most paediatric subjects hospitalised for

RSV infection were healthy prior to infection and had no known risk factors.34F
risk factors for severe RSV infections mentioned in the literature.  As with overall infection, 
a prominent theme among many risk factors is that they contribute to the individual having a 
relatively weak immune system.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
•  Morbidity 
RSV infections are thought to be ubiquitous among young paediatric subjects worldwide, 
with the vast majority being infected at least once by the age of 2 years. 22,23,
bronchiolitis is the most frequent airway infection in the first 2 years of life and RSV is the 
virus most often responsible. 43  Acquired immunity from infection is temporary and 
therefore reinfection is common, with perhaps 75% of paediatric subjects experiencing a 
second infection by age 2 years. 22  Information about overall RSV morbidity—that is, 
morbidity for both cases requiring and not requiring medical attention—is often sparse 
because national surveillance can be incomplete and infection reporting voluntary. 17  Most 
information is limited to cases sufficiently severe to require medical attention, whether 
hospitalisations, outpatient visits, or a combination of the two. 
43  Indeed, 
44F
Symptoms of RSV infection include severe lower respiratory tract infection, bronchiolitis, 
and pneumonia. 23,43  Timing plays a role in the disease, as around 50% cases of RSV 
hospitalisations among preterm infants occur among those born within the peak RSV season 
of winter.45F
such as impairment in lung function, bronchospasm, recurrent wheezing, asthma, acute otitis 
media, and allergic sensitisation. 33,43,22,

44  While the RSV infection itself is acute, it can lead to long-term complications 
46  These long-term complications may be more

47F

•  Medical Care 
The literature illuminates various aspects of the care received by RSV patients with 
infections severe enough to require medical attention.  The CDC reports that, annually for the 
US, RSV infections in paediatric subjects under 5 leads to, on average, 2.1 million outpatient 
visits and 58,000 hospitalisations. 6  In a US study of commercially-insured RSV cases from 
2008-14, outpatient visits accounted for the care setting for about 80% of paediatric subjects 
under 5 versus hospitalisations accounting for 5-10% for the same age group, with the 
remainder being emergency room or urgent care visits. 9  Altogether, most RSV cases severe 
enough to require some levels of medical attention do not require hospitalisation. 
For the 2015-16 RSV season at 7 paediatric medical centres across the US, Rha et al. 
identified 1,043 paediatric subjects under 5 hospitalised for RSV. 8  The median length of 
hospital stay for subjects who were RSV-positive was 2 days, 69% received supplemental 
oxygen, 17% were admitted to an ICU, and 3% required mechanical ventilation.  Pooled 
across the 7 centres, the rate of RSV-associated hospitalisations across all sites was 2.9 
hospitalisations/1000 population among paediatric subjects under 5, including an even higher 
rate of 6.3 hospitalisations/1000 population among paediatric subjects under 2.  Younger 
infants had still higher rates of hospitalisation: 14.7 hospitalisations/1000 population in 
paediatric subjects under 6 months and 18.9 hospitalisations/1000 population among 
paediatric subjects under 2 months. 
Page 20 
 
 
Anderson et al. analysed data from 7 European and North American databases totalling 7,820 
preterm infants. 44  Out of the 7 datasets, 5 had data on infants hospitalised for RSV infection 
who received supplemental oxygen.  The authors found a wide range across datasets in the 
proportion receiving oxygen, from 32% (US) to 88% (Ireland).  In the pooled analysis, 70% 
of infants received supplemental oxygen.  The median duration that hospitalised infants 
received supplemental oxygen was consistent across datasets with a median of 4-5 days. 
Cai et al. examined hospitalised RSV cases from 84 hospitals in Germany for the period 
2009-18; their dataset included 8,521 cases under age 5 years. 32  Of those 8,521 hospitalised 
cases, 438 (5%) were admitted to the ICU.  The authors noted that, of ICU cases that required 
ventilator support, 81% were paediatric subjects under 5.  The paper reported a wealth of 
additional information on ICU cases, but these were not stratified by age.  However, 
paediatric subjects under 5 represented 89% of all ICU cases in their dataset, making it likely 
that the rest of the ICU results largely apply to paediatric subjects under 5.  For ICU cases 
across all ages, the mean and median length of ICU stay were 9 and 5 days, respectively.  
During the ICU stay, 38% required ventilator support. About 91% of ICU-admitted RSV 
cases were discharged home, 6% transferred to other facilities, and 3% died in the hospital.  
For ventilated cases, the mean and median ventilation length were 211 and 112 hours, 
respectively. About 82% of ventilated cases were discharged home, 10% transferred to other 
facilities, and 8% died in the hospital. 
Kuhdari et al. analysed data on 57,656 hospitalised RSV cases across all ages in Italy during 
2001-14, of which 89% were under 1 year of age. 48F
category had the highest hospitalisation rate at 674 hospitalisations per 100,000 population.  
In the period 2001–2014, out of a total of 54,661 hospitalised paediatric subjects 0-2 years 
old, 93% were less than 1 year old and 24% were under 2 months old.  For paediatric 
subjects 0-14 years old, the average duration of hospitalisation was 5 days. 
47  They found that the under 1-year age 
Using a population-based national register from Denmark, Jensen et al. examined 10,956 
48  Of these, 59% 
paediatric subjects under 5 who were hospitalised for RSV during 2010-16.49F
were under 6 months and 76% were under 12 months.  The incidence of RSV hospitalisation 
was high in early infancy, peaking during the second month of life at almost 60 cases/1000 
child-years, then decreasing to almost no hospitalised cases by age 3 years. 
•  Long-Term Consequences of Infection 
Important outcomes of RSV infection are not limited to severe acute symptoms: infection can 
increase risk of later developing chronic conditions such as impaired lung function, 46 
persistent wheezing, 33,45 or asthma. 33,46,45  Estimates of the strength of these relationships 
vary widely, at least partly due to differences in study design.  One systematic review 
summarised studies of RSV infection before age 3 years as reporting that, subsequently, 4-
47% of paediatric subjects develop recurrent wheezing and 8-76% develop asthma after up to 
25 years follow-up (average follow-up 6–8 years).33  A study of 189 Greek paediatric 
subjects who were hospitalised for RSV infection during infancy found that the following 
predictors were associated with development of asthma later in childhood: male gender, 
breastfeeding for less than 3 months, living in a home environment with moisture damage 
and/or tobacco smoke by at least 2 residents, and sensitization to at least one aeroallergen.50F
49  
Page 21 
 
 
A Norwegian prospective cohort study also reported that male gender was associated with 
worse impairment in young adult lung function following RSV-related bronchiolitis in 
infancy. 46  
•  Mortality 
Global mortality was estimated in a 2022 systematic review by the RSV Global 
Epidemiology Network. 3  The authors estimated that globally, for the year 2019, there were 
101,400 total RSV-related deaths in paediatric patients under age 5 years, of which 26,300 
were in-hospital deaths.  In other words, 0.31% (101,400 out of 33.0 million) of global RSV 
cases among paediatric patients under age 5 years were estimated to end with RSV-related 
death.  Paediatric subjects under 6 months were at elevated risk of death, with an estimated 
13,300 in-hospital deaths due to RSV.  Notably, low- and middle-income countries were 
estimated to account for more than 97% of RSV-attributable deaths in paediatric RSV cases 
under age 5 years. 3   
Hansen et al. estimated the annual RSV-related mortality burden in the US by examining 
50  Table 5 summarises their 
over 50 million death certificates from the period 1999-2018.51F
key results for paediatric subjects under 5.  Similar to the data on severe infections cited in 
earlier sections, although overall mortality from RSV in paediatric subjects is very low, 
paediatric subjects under 1 year of age die from RSV at a higher rate than paediatric subjects 
aged 1-4 years.  Table 5 suggests that approximately 250-300 paediatric subjects under the 
age of 5 years died from RSV annually across the US during the era before COVID-19 public 
health measures.  Notably, while young paediatric subjects are generally at greater risk of 
being infected with RSV than adults, Hansen et al. estimated much higher RSV mortality 
rates for older adults than they did for paediatric subjects under 5, with point estimates (in 
deaths per 100,000 population per year) of 11.8 for 50–64-year-old and 46.8 for those 65 and 
older.  Those aged 5-49 had an estimated RSV mortality rate of essentially zero.

Several primary studies of paediatric subjects under age 5 years who were hospitalised with 
RSV recorded deaths among their observed cases.  Two small studies from the US—those by 
Hall et al. (919 cases) and Rha et al. (1,043 cases)—both reported zero deaths in their 
datasets. 7,8  In a German study of 8,521 paediatric subjects hospitalised with RSV, the 
authors reported that 10 (0.1%) died from the infection. 32  These numbers are consistent with 
Page 22 
 
 
 
the Hansen modelling estimates suggesting that, while RSV infections are extremely 
common in young paediatric subjects and often cause significant morbidity, they are rarely 
fatal. 
Important co-morbidities 
Among paediatric subjects under 5 hospitalised for RSV infection, up to 67% had neither a 
known comorbid condition nor were born preterm. 10,7,8  Nevertheless, that leaves a 
substantial proportion of young paediatric subjects with severe RSV infection who do have a 
comorbidity.  Table 6 lists comorbidities highlighted in the literature.

SI.2. Indication for active immunisation of adults ≥60 years 
Active immunisation of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of lower 
respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. 
The literature search strategy used to evaluate the epidemiology of RSV in the older adult 
population was identical to that used for the paediatric population.  However, the focus was 
on articles that reported separate data for older adults. Incidence in older adults was 
commonly reported in age groups of 50-64 years, and 65 years and older.  Therefore, while 
the population of interest was adults aged 60 years and older, data on the blended “50+” and 
“50-64” age groups were included.   
Incidence 
•  Global  
While the majority of symptomatic RSV-associated respiratory infections occur in early 
childhood, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of RSV-associated acute respiratory 
illness (ARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) estimated that RSV infection accounts for 1-7% 
of ILI-ARI in adults and 1-10% of ILI-ARI in adults ages ≥50 years. 53F
52  In this same meta-

analysis, the proportion of ILI-ARI attributable to RSV infection varied by geographic 
location, with higher estimates in the US and Europe compared to Africa and Asia. 52  
However, it is possible that these observed geographic differences may be driven by 
differences in surveillance rather than by true differences in the population distribution of 
RSV infection. 52  
•  North America and Europe 
In the US, many state-based health surveillance systems report the weekly count of PCR 
detections of RSV, but incidence rates and proportions are not typically reported. 17  This is 
similar in Europe, where country-based surveillance systems also report RSV case counts, 
but not incidence rates or proportions. 18,
estimates of RSV incidence come from independent research studies rather than national or 
international surveillance systems. 
53  Due to these challenges, many of the best

•  Studies of long-term care facilities and medically attended RSV 
Prospective seasonal and annual estimates of RSV incidence among older adults in North 
America and Europe focus on the incidence of RSV among populations residing in long-term 
care facilities (Table 7), and among individuals presenting to a medical facility for ARI or 
ILI (Table 8).  In long-term care facilities, seasonal estimates of the incidence of RSV range 
from 112 to 556 cases per 10,000 persons (Table 7).

*Annual incidence represents incidence over the course of one year for studies with yearly study periods, and

incidences per 10,000 persons were calculated by multiplying the number of RSV cases per person-year by 
10,000. 
Seasonal and annual estimates of medically attended RSV incidence are commonly reported 
in the literature as the number of individuals seeking medical care for ARI or ILI who are

medical care is more strictly defined to encompass only emergency department visits or

attention drop to between 11 and 20 cases per 10,000 persons ages ≥50 and between <1 
(a low outlier) and 34 cases per 10,000 persons ages ≥65 years (Table 8).

*Annual incidence represents incidence over the course of one year for studies with yearly study periods, and 
incidence over the course of one respiratory viral season for studies with seasonal study periods.  
†Range of point estimates observed over multiple respiratory viral seasons 
Several studies reported a positive association between age and incidence of medically 
attended RSV.  Among studies stratified on age 65 years, the annual incidence of medically 
attended RSV ranged from 3.4-12.8 cases per 10,000 persons among adults ages 50-64 to 
6.0-34.0 cases per 10,000 persons among adults ages 65 years and older. 63,62,61,64  
Two studies included here also considered age-related trends in incidence among those ages 
65 years and older.  A 2017-2020 study of data from multiple New York hospital systems 
reported an annual incidence of 8.3-12.6 cases per 10,000 adults ages 65-74 years, an annual 
incidence of 15.5-28.1 cases per 10,000 adults ages 75-84 years, and an annual incidence of 
20.7-66.6 cases per 10,000 adults ages ≥85 years, 64 and a 2008-2014 study of a US 
commercially-insured population using the MarketScan database found an annual incidence 
of 33 cases per 10,000 adults ages 65-74 years, 55 cases per 10,000 adults ages 75-84 years, 
and 81 cases per 10,000 adults ages ≥85 years. 9  
•  Seasonality 
As described in Section SI.1, RSV infection rates vary seasonally with peak incidence 
occurring in the winter months. 16,17,6,18,
from the US Optum Clinformatics Data Mart and MarketScan suggest that the seasonality of 
RSV infection is more pronounced among adults over age 65 years compared to adults ages 
18-64 years. 66

Prevalence 
The point prevalence of RSV infection among older adults closely tracks disease incidence 
due to the acute nature of the illness; however, reports on the point prevalence of RSV 
infection among those seeking medical care for ARI or ILI are important to understanding 
the medical burden of RSV infection.  Results of individual studies that evaluated the 
proportion of older adults testing positive for RSV while receiving medical attention for ARI 
are presented below with proportions RSV-positive among adults aged ≥50 ranging from 
3.1% to 14.4%, and the proportion RSV-positive among adults aged ≥90 as high as 40.0% 
(Table 9).  A meta-analysis by Shi et al. (2020) estimated that the proportion of adults ages 
≥65 years and hospitalised with ARI who are RSV-positive is 4.4% (95% CI: 4.0% to 6.5%). 
58 Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported estimates ranging from 1% to 18% 
for adults ages ≥50 years, and as high as 40% for adults ages ≥90 years. 57,52

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease 
Demographics 
•  Age 
RSV infection can be severe among older adults, and the incidence of RSV-infection 
requiring medical attention increases with age. 57,58,52  In a study of a US commercially-
insured population using the 2008-2014 MarketScan database, the proportion of RSV cases 
diagnosed in an inpatient setting increased from 2.8% among those ages 50-64 years to 
11.8% among those 85 years and older. 9  Data from a single tertiary hospital also found an 
age-related increase in the proportion of patients with medically attended ARI who are 
RSV-positive; the proportion increased from 7.3% among patient 50-59 years to 40.0% 
among patients aged ≥90 years (Table 9).69  These findings are consistent with the positive 
age-related trend in incidence among adults ages 65 years and older. 64,9  They’re also 
consistent with findings from a study conducted in 3 New York City hospitals from 2017-
2019 in which 403 hospitalised adults ages 18 years and older had laboratory-confirmed RSV 
infections.76F
years old.   
75  Of these 403 adults, 57% were at least 65 years old and 85% were at least 50 
•  Gender 
Several studies included information on the gender distribution of RSV cases among older 
adults.  In a US community-based, prospective cohort study of adults ages ≥50 years, 53.0% 
of the cohort was female, while 61.6% of RSV cases were female. 59  The greater proportion 
of females among medically attended RSV cases compared to the underlying cohort suggests 
that either RSV infection is more common among females or that females are more likely to 
seek medical care following RSV infection.  
In studies which did not report the gender distribution in the underlying population, the 
gender distribution of RSV cases must be evaluated with caution.  In one such study, a 
German cohort, which included 122 RSV cases ages ≥65 years and hospitalised during 2009-
2018, 50% of RSV cases were female. 32  In the US, a Southern California retrospective 
cohort examined 664 hospitalised adults ages ≥60 years who tested positive for RSV during 
76  Data from these same studies suggest that 
2011-15, and females comprised 61% of cases.77F
even if risk of RSV infection is higher among females, disease severity does not differ by 
gender.  For example, Cai et al. (2020) reported that, among adults ages 65 years and older, 
an equal proportion of males and females hospitalised with RSV infection required 
ventilation, slightly fewer females (28%) compared to males (31%) were admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) for RSV infection, and slightly fewer males (8%) than females 
(11%) did not survive their infection with RSV. 32  Gender-based differences in mortality 
were also not evident in the Southern California cohort where 11% of females and 12% of 
males ages ≥60 years died within 60 days of hospital admission with RSV. 76  
Page 28 
 
 
 
 
•  Race and ethnicity 
Two studies that included sizeable populations of older adults reported the distribution of 
race and ethnicity within their RSV cases. 75,76  However, since the racial and ethnic 
distributions of the underlying populations were not reported, variations in the incidence of 
RSV infection by race and ethnicity cannot be inferred from either study.   
In Goldman et al. (2022), a study of 403 adults hospitalised with RSV, 85% of cases were 
≥50 years old.  Across all ages, the distribution of cases by race was 26% White, 20% Black 
or African American, 51% unknown race, and 3% Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific 
Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native. 75 The distribution of Hispanic ethnicity was 32% 
Hispanic, 18% non-Hispanic, and 50% unknown.  In Tseng et al. (2020), a 2011-2015 study 
of Kaiser Permanente Southern California patients ages ≥60 years, the distribution of cases 
by race was 65.5% White, 16.9% Black, 10.4% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3.8% other or 
multiple, and 3.5% unknown. 76 The distribution of Hispanic ethnicity was 23.2% Hispanic 
and 76.8% non-Hispanic.   
Goldman et al. (2022) also quantified RSV severity by race and ethnicity.  The occurrence of 
severe clinical outcome (defined as being admitted to an ICU, receiving mechanical 
ventilation, or dying during the RSV-associated hospitalisation) was highest among people 
classified as Black or African American (24%), intermediate among those of unknown race 
(20%) and lowest among those classified as White (16%). 75 No severe clinical outcomes 
occurred among the very small population of those classified as Asian/Native 
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native.  The occurrence of severe 
clinical outcome was lower among people classified as Hispanic (15%) compared to those 
classified as non-Hispanic (22%), or unknown ethnicity (21%).  
Risk Factors 
•  Risk factors for RSV infection 
Both sociodemographic and health factors are associated with risk of RSV infection 
(Table 10) Sociodemographic factors that increase risk of contracting RSV during adulthood 
include older age, living in a long-term care facility, or participating in a senior day care 
program.57,60,
77,52  Health factors that increase risk of contracting RSV during adulthood 
include frailty, cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease [COPD], congestive heart failure [CHF]), diabetes, and an acute or chronic 
immunocompromised state.79F

between older adults and young children. 57  For example, RSV viral titres are lower in adults 
compared to children, and many older adults infected with RSV never experience fever. 57,52

The severity of RSV symptoms and progression can depend on both viral load and host 
factors (e.g., expression of ligand IFN- λ 1).6  Poor outcomes (e.g., hospitalisation, ICU 
usage, death) are most common among older adults with at least one chronic health 
condition, e.g., a cardiovascular condition, pulmonary condition, or immunodeficiency.

attention for RSV, 29-39% are diagnosed with pneumonia. 66  Additionally, some adults ages 
50 years and older develop severe RSV infection and require hospitalisation.  Hospitalisation 
of older adults with RSV typically lasts 3-6 days with some adults requiring supplemental 
oxygen or mechanical ventilation and 10-31% of hospitalised adults spending time in an

•  Mortality 
93  An US-based study reviewing death certificates issued 
Before the emergence of COVID-19, the CDC estimated 14,000 RSV-related deaths annually 
among adults ages 65 years and older within the US. 6  A review from the UK estimated 
8,482 RSV-related deaths annually among adults in the UK, with 93% of them occurring in 
people ages 65 years and older.94F
between 1999-2018 found an annual mortality rate of 2.2 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 
2.0 -2.30) among those with RSV infection accompanied by ARI or ILI, 50 and the RSV 
mortality rate increased with increasing age, i.e., from 1.0 per 100,000 persons (95% CI: 0.9 
– 1.0) among those ages 50-64 years to 14.7 per 100,000 persons (95% CI: 13.8 – 15.5) 
among those ages ≥65 years. 50  Additional studies from the US and Germany found similar 
95,32 and a review described how 
trends of increasing RSV-mortality with increasing age,95F
mortality rates due to RSV rise from 1 per 100,000 population in ages 18–49 years to 155 per 
100,000 in ages 75 years and above. 93  Further, deaths due to RSV increase after age 49 
years, representing 4.2% of all respiratory disease deaths among ages 18–49 years, 5.9% in 
ages 50–64 years, 5.7% among ages 65–74 years, and 5.9% in ages 75 years and over. 93

Important co-morbidities 
RSV comorbidities for patients ages 50 years and older are presented in Table 12.  Comorbid 
cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD, CHF, acute coronary syndrome, 
arrhythmias, occurrence of myocardial infarction) are the most common 81,57,82,58,
Annually, 4-10% of older adults with chronic cardiopulmonary disease contract RSV (Shi 
2021),98 and at least 50% of RSV patients ages 65 years and older have a comorbid 
cardiopulmonary condition. 9  Diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease are the next most 
common comorbid conditions, affecting at least 10% of RSV patients ages 50 years and 
older.9

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
The key studies in the nonclinical toxicity assessment for RSVpreF consisted of a 
GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study in Wistar Han rats and a GLP-compliant combined 
fertility and developmental toxicity study in NZW rabbits. In both studies, RSVpreF was 
administered intramuscularly at 2x the clinical dose (120 μg each of 847A and 847B; total 
240 μg antigen per dose), with or without Al(OH)3. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity study, a total of 3 doses of RSVpreF administered on Days 1, 22, 
and 36 was tolerated without evidence of systemic toxicity, produced an anticipated 
inflammatory response, and elicited a functional antibody response. Non-adverse immune 
responses and/or inflammatory changes were evident at the injection sites and draining 
lymph nodes. Clinical pathology changes, when present, were consistent with immune 
stimulation or inflammation at the injection sites.  
No indications of maternal systemic toxicity or effects on mating performance, female 
fertility, or embryo-foetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the F1 offspring 
were observed in the combined fertility and developmental toxicity study in NZW rabbits 
following the administration of RSVpreF, with or without Al(OH)3, for a total of 4 doses 
(twice premating and on Gestation Days 10 and 24). 
In summary, the nonclinical safety findings related to RSVpreF administration represent an 
expected immune reaction to vaccine administration and are clinically manageable or 
acceptable risks in the intended populations. No identified or potential important risks were 
noted (Table 13).

Table 13.  Key safety findings and relevance to human usage 
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Non-adverse local reactions are an anticipated 
vaccine effect that are clinically manageable 
and acceptable. Therefore, they are not 
considered an important risk to humans. 
Toxicity  
Repeat-Dose Toxicity in Rats 
RSVpreF (2x clinical dose) was tolerated without evidence 
of systemic toxicity. RSVpreF-related changes in 
neutrophils, acute phase proteins, and albumin: globulin 
ratio as well as microscopic findings at the injection site 
and in the draining lymph nodes were consistent with 
those seen with administration of vaccines. 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity  
No vaccine-related effects on mating performance or 
female fertility, or the survival, growth, or development of 
foetuses or offspring were observed in a fertility and 
developmental toxicity study of RSVpreF in rabbits at 2x 
the clinical dose.

Important Identified Risk: None 
Important Potential Risk: Guillain-Barrè syndrome  
Risk-benefit impact: 
GBS is a life-threatening condition, nevertheless no causal relationship has been yet 
established with RSVpreF and given the rarity of the event, the overall benefit-risk profile 
remain unchanged and favourable.  For addressing this important potential risk, the following 
PASS study is proposed: A Post-Marketing Safety Study of Respiratory Syncytial Virus 
Vaccine among Older Adults in the United States (C3671031). 
Missing information  
Risk-benefit impact: The safety profile of the vaccine is not known in: 
• 
• 
immunocompromised pregnant women and high-risk pregnancies due to their 
exclusion from pivotal clinical studies. 
immunocompromised older adults or renally or hepatically impaired older adults aged 
60 years and older due to their exclusion from pivotal clinical studies.  
In order to address this information, two non-interventional studies are proposed: Safety of 
respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF) in pregnant 
women and their offspring in a real world setting in Europe (C3671026) and Safety of 
respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF) in 
immunocompromised, or renally or hepatically impaired older adults aged 60 years and 
older in a real world setting in Europe (C3671038).

SVII.3.1.2. Important Potential Risk: Guillain-Barrè syndrome has been reported in the 
clinical trial in adults ≥60 years of age (C3671013). Although GBS has not been reported in 
clinical trials in pregnant women, given the biological plausibility, GBS has been added as an 
important potential risk for both populations intended to be vaccinated with RSVpreF.

Guillain-Barrè syndrome is a peripheral neuropathy with acute onset and is 
characterized by acute flaccid paralysis, symmetrical weakness of the limbs, and 
hyporeflexia or areflexia, which reaches a maximum severity within 4 weeks. 
GBS typically occurs after an infectious disease in which the immune response 
generates antibodies that cross-react with gangliosides at nerve membranes. This 
autoimmune response results in nerve damage or functional blockade of nerve 
conduction.  GBS is a life-threatening disease and the mortality rates in EU and 
North America vary between 3% and 7%. 104F
case per million above the background incidence has been associated with the 
1976 New Jersey Swine Influenza vaccination programme and of about 1 case per 
thousand associated with rabies vaccination. 106F
Two cases of GBS and one case of Miller Fisher syndrome were reported in the 
older adult phase 3 study (C3671013) in participants vaccinated with RSVpreF. 
Two cases were assessed as possibly related to the administered vaccine by the 
investigator (both had either confounding factors or an alternative aetiology), and 
one case, assessed as not related by the investigator, was reported eight months 
after RSVpreF vaccination (unplausible temporal relationship). One additional 
case of GBS was reported in the placebo group. No cases of GBS were reported in 
the phase 3 study in maternal participants (C3671008).   
Most studies that estimate incidence rates of GBS were done in Europe and North 
America and showed a similar range of 0.8-1.9 cases per 100000 people per year. 
The annual incidence rate of GBS increases with age (0.6 per 100000 per year in 
children and 2.7 per 100000 per year in elderly people aged 80 years and over). 
Seasonal fluctuations, presumably related to variations in infectious antecedents, 
have been reported, but these observations are rarely statistically significant. 
Currently, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange are proven 
effective treatments for GBS. 
The annual incidence rate of GBS increase with age (0.6 per 100000 per year in 
children and 2.7 per 100000 per year in elderly people aged 80 years and over. 
Many different preceding infections have been identified in patients with the 
disorder, but only for a few microorganisms has an association been shown in 
case-control studies C jejuni is the predominant infection, found in 25–50% of the 
adult patients, with a higher frequency in Asian countries. Other infections 
associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome are cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-
Barr virus, influenza A virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus 
influenzae. An association of Guillain-Barré syndrome with hepatitis E has been 
identified in patients from both the Netherlands and Bangladesh.108F
emerging relation between Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute arbovirus infection 
including Zika and chikungunya is being closely monitored and is the subject of 
major interest as the global epidemic spreads.

Preventability 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Public health impact 
As current data does not support a causal relationship between RSVpreF vaccine 
and increased risk GBS, there are no known precautions. 
GBS could have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life, and mortality 
rates in EU and North America vary between 3% and 7%. 
Among all clinical studies capturing RSVpreF among adults 60+ years of age, 
there are 2 cases of GBS (1 case of GBS and one case of Miller Fisher syndrome 
in the RSVpreF group; event outcome reported as resolved with sequalae and 
resolved respectively) reported out of 2,386 person-years of exposure as of 13 Oct 
2022 within a 42-day risk window (among 20,752 participants 60+ years of age 
exposed to any RSVpreF dose and assuming no loss to follow-up within 42 days 
[20752*42]/365.25). These two cases were assessed as possibly related to 
RSVpreF vaccination by the investigator. Two additional cases (one GBS in the 
RSVpreF group and one GBS in the placebo group) occurred at 8- and 14-months 
follow-up, respectively, and were outside the plausible risk window for a temporal 
relationship and not deemed related to RSVpreF vaccination by the investigator 
(outcome reported as recovered for both cases). Although GBS is a serious life-
threatening disease, given the rarity of the event, it is not expected to have a 
significant impact on public health.

PART III. PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1. Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance for the lifecycle of a product is a critical component to the 
detection, assessment, understanding and mitigation of AEs. Objectives of routine 
pharmacovigilance includes having processes in place to assure the ongoing and timely 
collection, processing, follow-up, and analysis of individual AE reports and aggregate data 
globally, following global safety Standard Operating Procedures and regulatory guidance. 
Pfizer monitors the safety profile of its products, evaluates issues potentially impacting 
product benefit-risk profiles in a timely manner, and ensures that appropriate communication 
of relevant safety information is conveyed in a timely manner to regulatory authorities and 
other interested parties as appropriate and in accordance with international principles and 
prevailing regulations. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond ADRs reporting and signal detection: 
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for safety concerns:  
There are no specific adverse event follow-up questionnaires addressing any of the safety 
concerns for this RMP.   
•  Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for safety concerns: 
As part of the signal detection activities will include analysis of (not limited to): 
•  Spontaneous cases 
•  Clinical trial data 
•  Literature 
If the review of the data leads to an impact on the benefit risk of the product, a benefit-risk 
discussion and any warranted product information updates will be submitted via appropriate 
variation procedure. Data will be summarised in a dedicated section in the PSUR. 
Furthermore, routine PV activities for the maternal recipients of RSVpreF will include the 
use of the Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) questionnaire to obtain general information on 
the pregnancy and the pregnancy outcome. For prospective EDP cases (where the pregnancy 
is ongoing), the EDP Questionnaire will be sent to collect preliminary information such as 
source of information, maternal information (e.g., demographics and pregnancy), exposure to 
products (including use of recreational drugs), any medical history (including any obstetrical 
history) as well as any paternal information, as applicable. Following the expected date of 
delivery, a second EDP Follow-up Questionnaire will be sent to gather additional

III.2. Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
As immunocompromised pregnant women and women with high-risk pregnancies, and 
immunocompromised or renally or hepatically impaired older adults ≥60 years old were not 
included in the clinical studies to date, and to address the safety concern of Guillain-Barrè 
syndrome, Pfizer plans to conduct the PASS studies summarised below. 
Study short name and title: 
A post-marketing safety study of respiratory syncytial virus vaccine among older adults in 
the United States (C3671031). 
Rationale and study objectives: 
As the phase 3 study RENOIR (C3671013) was not powered to evaluate the risk of rare 
adverse events, a post-marketing safety study is planned to further evaluate the risk of GBS, 
other immune-mediated demyelinating conditions and polyneuropathies following RSVpreF 
administration among older adults.  
Study design: 
This will be a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study among US Medicare 
beneficiaries. Two study designs commonly used in vaccine safety studies will be used: 
First, an internal comparator design aims to estimate the incidence of GBS, and other 
immune-mediated demyelinating conditions, during a pre-defined risk window (e.g., 1-42 
days post vaccination) among Medicare beneficiaries who receive RSVpreF versus those 
who are not vaccinated with RSVpreF at that point in time.  Secondly, a self-controlled risk 
interval (SCRI) analysis may also be conducted among RSVpreF vaccinated Medicare 
beneficiaries to compare the incidence of GBS, other immune-mediated demyelinating 
conditions and polyneuropathies during the post-vaccination risk window (e.g., 1-42 days 
post vaccination) to the post-vaccination control window (e.g., 43-84 days post vaccination). 
Study population: 
Eligible Medicare beneficiaries who receive RSVpreF and a comparator cohort of Medicare 
beneficiaries who do not receive RSVpreF. 
Milestones: 
Planned final protocol submission to the FDA: 30 November 2023 
Planned final report submission to the FDA: 31 May 2030

Safety of respiratory syncytial virus stabilised prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF) in 
pregnant women and their offspring in a real world setting in Europe (C3671026). 
Rationale and study objectives:  
As immunocompromised pregnant women and high-risk pregnancies were not included in 
the clinical studies to date, Pfizer plans to address this missing information by conducting a 
PASS study with the following objectives: 
1) To evaluate the safety of RSVpreF in all pregnant women and their offspring who receive 
RSVpreF, compared to a relevant matched comparator group of pregnant women and their 
offspring who do not receive RSVpreF.; 
2) To evaluate the safety of RSVpreF in immunocompromised pregnant women and high-
risk pregnancies and their offspring who receive RSVpreF, compared to a relevant matched 
comparator group of pregnant women and their offspring who do not receive RSVpreF.; 
Study design: 
This is a multi-database cohort study utilizing electronic health care data sources from among 
members of the Vaccine Monitoring Collaboration for Europe (VAC4EU).

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for ABRYSVO (respiratory syncytial virus vaccine 
[bivalent, recombinant]) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Abrysvo. The RMP details 
important risks of Abrysvo, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Abrysvo’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Abrysvo’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and vaccine recipients on how Abrysvo should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Abrysvo should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Abrysvo’s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Abrysvo is indicated for the maternal immunisation during pregnancy to provide protection 
in infants from birth through 6 months of age against lower respiratory tract disease caused 
by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and for active immunisation of individuals 60 years of 
age and older for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV.  It 
contains RSV subgroup A stabilised prefusion F protein (60 micrograms) and RSV subgroup 
B stabilised prefusion F protein (60 micrograms) as the active substances and it is given 
intramuscularly. 
Further information about the evaluation of Abrysvo’s benefits can be found in Abrysvo’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/abrysvo. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Abrysvo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Abrysvo's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to vaccine recipients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
Page 60 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the vaccine recipient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Abrysvo is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Abrysvo are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Abrysvo. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of Important Risks 
There are no important identified risks for RSVpreF. Guillain-Barrè syndrome has been 
reported in adults ≥60 years of age. Although GBS has not been reported in clinical trials in 
pregnant women, given the biological plausibility, GBS has been added as an important 
potential risk for both populations intended to be vaccinated with RSVpreF. 
Table 41.  Important potential risk - Guillain-Barrè syndrome  
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Two cases of GBS and one case of Miller Fisher syndrome were reported in the 
older adult phase 3 study (C3671013) in participants vaccinated with RSV. Two 
cases were assessed as possibly related to the administered vaccine by the 
investigator (both had either confounding factors or an alternative aetiology), 
and one case, assessed as not related by the investigator, was reported eight 
months after RSV vaccination (unplausible temporal relationship). One 
additional case of GBS was reported in the placebo group. No cases of GBS 
were reported in the phase 3 study in maternal participants (C3671008).

activities 
The annual incidence rate of GBS increase with age (0.6 per 100000 per year in 
children and 2.7 per 100000 per year in elderly people aged 80 years and over. 
Many different preceding infections have been identified in patients with the 
disorder, but only for a few microorganisms has an association been shown in 
case-control studies C jejuni is the predominant infection, found in 25–50% of 
the adult patients, with a higher frequency in Asian countries. Other infections 
associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome are cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-
Barr virus, influenza A virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus 
influenzae. An association of Guillain-Barré syndrome with hepatitis E has been 
identified in patients from both the Netherlands and Bangladesh. 107,108 An 
emerging relation between Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute arbovirus 
infection including Zika and chikungunya is being closely monitored and is the 
subject of major interest as the global epidemic spreads.

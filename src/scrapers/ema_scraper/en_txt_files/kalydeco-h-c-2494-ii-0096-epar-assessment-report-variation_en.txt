2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Kalydeco is currently approved in the EU in a combination regimen with Kaftrio 
(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ELX/TEZ/IVA) to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years 
and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, regardless of the second CFTR 
allele (F/any).  
This type II variation application seeks to expand the indication of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio 
to patients with CF aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR 
gene or heterozygous for F508del and have a minimal function (MF) mutation in the CFTR gene. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations 
in the CFTR gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The 
CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel contributing to the regulation of salt and water 
absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the 
multisystem pathology associated with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein result in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF.  
The biochemical defect of chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of lung, 
pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into 
adulthood.  
F508del is the most common mutation in the CFTR gene, and the vast majority of CF patients 
(~85.8% in the US and ~82.4% in Europe) have this mutation on at least on 1 allele. 
The initially claimed therapeutic indication was as follows: Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for the treatment of adults, 
adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or heterozygous for F508del and have a minimal function (MF) 
mutation in the CFTR gene. 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 8/86 
 
  
 
 
 
Epidemiology and screening tools 
CF affects approximately a total of 31,000 individuals in the US and a total of 42.000 in the EU 
(excluding the data from Russia, Turkey and Israel)1,2. The incidence and prevalence of CF vary 
between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North 
America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. In Europe, the median age of all CF 
patients is 18.5 years (with the youngest patient being diagnosed just after birth and the oldest 
patients being 88.4 years of age). Despite advances in treatment, the current median age of death in a 
patient with CF was approximately 31 years in 2018, and the future predicted median age of survival is 
approximately 47 years1,2. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CF is an autosomal recessive disease in which disease-causing mutations are present on both CFTR 
alleles that make up a patient’s genotype. Severity of CF is determined by the extent of the loss of 
CFTR-mediated chloride transport caused by the 2 CFTR mutant alleles. Historically, these CFTR 
mutations have been categorized in different ways including a class system based on their effect on 
CFTR protein synthesis or function (Classes I through V) and grouping based on phenotypic expression 
(e.g., residual CFTR function). To study the impact of CFTR modulators, the MAH has categorized 
mutations as follows: gating (G), residual function (RF), and minimal function (MF). 
Patients with CF who have 2 alleles that result in complete or near complete loss of CFTR-mediated 
chloride transport (e.g., F508del, Class I mutations which make no CFTR protein, gating mutations 
such as G551D) demonstrate severe CF characterized by early onset and relatively rapid disease 
progression, with sweat chloride concentrations (an in vivo marker of CFTR function) typically greater 
than 90 mmol/L.  
For patients with residual function mutations or those who are partially treated by existing CFTR 
modulator therapy, further increases in CFTR-mediated chloride transport are expected to be 
associated with further normalization of physiology and disease consequences. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across epithelia in various 
tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Decreased 
CFTR quantity or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues leading to 
the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of 
mortality. The clinical manifestations are those of progressive airway obstruction and bronchiectasis, 
with periods of worsening pulmonary symptoms associated with a decline in pulmonary function and 
increased bacterial density in airway secretions (pulmonary exacerbations). Obstruction of airways with 
thick mucus, establishment of a chronic bacterial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory 
responses are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading 
to respiratory failure. In addition, poor growth and nutritional status have historically been common in 
patients with CF owing to a number of factors, including pancreatic insufficiency-related fat 
malabsorption, increased energy expenditure attributable to progressive lung disease, appetite 
suppression attributable to chronic infection, and CF-related diabetes.

Management 
Most treatments available for the treatment of CF are symptomatic, but the CFTR modulators may 
improve CFTR function, which is believed to be the primary cause of disease. Current treatment 
guidelines recommend CFTR modulator and symptomatic medications concomitantly administered to 
maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and improve 
quality of life. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
In the EU, Kalydeco tablets are indicated:  
•  As monotherapy for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older

In support of the current application, the phase 3 study 106 in paediatric CF patients was conducted to 
evaluate the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA administered in triple combination in combination with kalydeco 
in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, and to assess if target exposures observed in subjects ≥ 18 
years of age were achieved in the younger population with the proposed dosing scheme. 
For patients 6 through 11 years of age, ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with Kalydeco is proposed to be 
administered with fat-containing food as follows: 
• 
• 
Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h (two 50/25/37.5 mg 
FDC film-coated tablets in the morning and one Kalydeco 75 mg film-coated tablet in the 
evening) 
Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h (two 100/50/75 
mg FDC film-coated tablets in the morning and one Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablet in the 
evening) 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 12/86 
 
  
 
 
Based on the provided study 106, in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, it was shown that applying a 
30 kg cut-off for the applied normal adult for 50% of the adult dose would result in ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures most similar to exposures in subjects ≥18 years of age while maintaining M23-ELX and M1-
TEZ exposures generally within ranges seen in previous studies of ELX/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA in 
combination with Kalydeco (see table 3 below). 
Further simulation showed that, when applying a 30 kg cut-off, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures for the <30 kg and ≥30 kg weight group were within the exposure range for subjects ≥18 
years of age. Exposures for subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed ≥30 kg were on the 
higher end of the exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age, whereas exposures for subjects who 
weighed <30 kg were on the lower end of the exposure range (see figure 1 below). 
The cut-off weight in paediatric patients (30 kg) for Kaftrio is identical to that for Symkevi 
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor).

Figure 1. Summary of steady-state AUC by age group for ELX, TEZ, IVA, and metabolites (popPK 
Studies Q075 and Q076) 
In this paediatric application, a lower dose Kaftrio tablet is proposed (i.e., ELX 50/TEZ 25/IVA 37.5 mg 
FDC tablet as compared to the ‘adult’ ELX 100/TEZ 50/IVA 75 mg FDC tablet). In comparative 
bioavailability study 011, exposures of ELX, TEZ, and IVA were unchanged in terms of AUC0-inf or 
Cmax when the study drug was administered as 2 low-dose ELX 50/TEZ 25/IVA 37.5 mg FDC tablets 
or 1 ELX 100/TEZ 50/IVA 75 mg reference tablet. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
There are no new pharmacodynamic studies submitted. However, the pharmacological parameter 
sweat chloride (SwCl) was studied in the main pivotal study; the results are presented and discussed 
in below sections of this report (see clinical section).  
Mechanism of action 
Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that enhances the channel gating activity of the CFTR. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated primary and secondary pharmacology studies in children 6-12 years were submitted. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In support of the current application, Phase 3 Study 106 in paediatric CF patients was conducted in 
order to evaluate the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA administered in triple combination in combination with 
Kalydeco in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, and to assess if target exposures observed in subjects 
≥18 years of age were achieved in the younger population with the proposed dosing scheme. 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 14/86 
 
  
 
 
 
  
For patients 6 through 11 years of age, ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with Kalydeco is proposed to be 
administered with fat-containing food as follows: 
•  Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
•  Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h 
The results of Study 106 demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 years of age the distributions of 
individual ELX, TEZ, and IVA in combination with Kalydeco exposures as indicated above were within 
the range of those observed in subjects ≥18 years of age.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The provided integrated assessment of pediatric exposure data, popPK modeling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off are appropriate 
for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA) is currently indicated for the treatment of 
CF patients aged 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.  
The application for an indication extension of ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with Kalydeco to include CF 
patients 6 through 11 years of age with at least one F508del mutation was supported by one clinical 
trial, VX19-445-106. While the protocol of Study VX19-445-107 was submitted, no data provided yet. 
•  VX18-445-106: Study 106, a Phase 3, multicenter study conducted in 2 parts (Parts A and B) 
to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 
through 11 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function (MF) 
mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype).  
•  VX19-445-107: Study 107, a Phase 3, open-label study evaluating the long-term safety and 
efficacy of VX-445/TEZ/IVA combination therapy in subjects with Cystic Fibrosis who are 6 
years of age and older. 
Given the underlying pathophysiology of CF, the applicant considered that efficacy in the 6 through 11 
years of age group might be extrapolated from data from the controlled Phase 3 studies in CF subjects 
≥12 years of age.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study: A Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA Triple Combination Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of Age (study 
VX18-445-106) 
Study VX18-445-106 (referred as Study 106 by the Applicant and hereinafter in this AR) was a 
Phase 3, open-label, 2-part (Parts A and B), multicenter study in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, 
with F/MF and F/F genotypes. Part A evaluated the PK, safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
administered for 15 days to confirm a dose for Part B. Part B evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK 
of ELX/TEZ/IVA administered for 24 weeks; efficacy assessments were also included as secondary 
endpoints. 
Methods 
Figure 2 shows the study design of part A. Subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) were planned for 
enrolment. A review of safety, tolerability, and available PK data was completed by an internal MAH 
team after Part A to confirm the doses for Part B. 
Figure 2. Part A Study Design 
Figure 3. shows the study design of part B.   
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue the study 
drug could enrol in an optional open-label extension safety study (enrolment was based on the 
eligibility criteria specified within the Open-label Extension Safety Study protocol).

Treatments 
Doses administered in the Part A and Part B of Study 106 are presented in Table 4. 
Part A 
The ELX dose of 100 mg qd selected for evaluation in Part A was determined based on population-PK 
modeling utilizing data from adults and simulating exposures over a range of body weights typical for a 
population of 6- to <12-year-olds, ranging from 15 to 50 kg. Based on the simulations, an ELX dose of 
100 mg qd was predicted to provide exposures that would not exceed the exposures observed in 
adults dosed with 200 mg qd. Hence, the ELX 100-mg qd dose was predicted to be safe and was 
evaluated in Part A for all subject weight groups. 
Part B 
• 
ELX Dosage 
Subjects in the higher weight range were administered ELX 200 mg qd. The appropriate weight cut-off 
for the switch from 100 mg qd to 200 mg qd was determined based on population-PK modelling that 
was updated with preliminary PK data from Part A and data from studies conducted in adult and 
adolescent CF subjects.  
• 
TEZ and IVA Dosages 
TEZ was administered as 50 mg qd and IVA was administered as 75 mg every 12 hours (q12h) in all 
subjects in Part A and in subjects weighing <30 kg in Part B. In part B, doses of TEZ 100 mg qd and 
IVA 150 mg q12h were administered in subjects weighing ≥30 kg. The dosages and weight cut-off 
were selected based on an evaluation of PK and safety of TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 to 11 years of age 
in Part A of Study 661-113.  
Table 4. Parts A and B Doses 
Treatment modification, interruption and discontinuation 
Modifications of the study drug dose were prohibited. Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, individual 
subjects were withdrawn from the study and dosing ceased. 
EMA/714293/2021

• 
Liver Function Tests 
In subjects who interrupted study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator resumed the 
study drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for the interruption. The medical monitor 
was to be notified. 
Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, were followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central 
laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and 
bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject could not return to the site for confirmatory testing, 
the use of a local laboratory was permitted.  
Study drug administration was interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the 
following criteria were met: 
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice.  
A thorough investigation of potential causes was conducted, and the subject was followed closely for 
clinical progression. 
Study drug administration was discontinued if the following criteria were met: 
• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirmed the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule 
(above), and no convincing alternative etiology was identified, regardless of whether transaminase 
levels had improved.  
All subjects in whom treatment was discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) had these levels monitored closely until levels normalized or returned to baseline. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice was identified, study drug administration was permitted to resume once 
transaminases returned to baseline or were ≤2 ×ULN, whichever was higher. Regardless of the 
duration of the interruption, the medical monitor was notified prior to resumption of the study drug.  
Upon resumption of the study drug, transaminases and bilirubin were assessed weekly for 4 weeks. 
If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurred within 4 weeks of 
rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 
72 hours), then the study drug was permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
•  Rash 
Individuals who developed a generalized rash were monitored closely. Study drug dosing was 
interrupted if a subject developed a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that was 
considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator notified the medical monitor of any rash 
that resulted in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher or was an SAE. Investigators were to 
consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count with differential, 
liver function tests [LFTs]), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator 
could consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically appropriate. 
Duration of Dosing 
For Part A, the 15-day duration of dosing was chosen to provide an adequate assessment of PK, safety, 
and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA before exposing subjects to a longer duration of treatment.  
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 20/86 
 
  
 
 
For part B, the 24-week duration of dosing was chosen to provide an adequate assessment of long-
term safety. 
Prohibited Medications 
Prohibited medication was identical for parts A and part B. Table 5. lists prohibited medications 
Table 5. Prohibited Medications 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medication rules were identical for parts A and part B. 
Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other medications, 
and herbal and naturopathic remedies, was collected from each subject’s source documentation for 
medications taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study participation. 
Guidelines for concomitant medication use were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Subjects were to remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the Day 
1 Visit through completion of study participation.  
Subjects could receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up 
to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days. 
Substrates of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, such as statins, 
glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide, were used with caution because ELX may inhibit OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3. 
Digoxin or other substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) with a narrow therapeutic index, such as 
cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, were used with caution and appropriate 
monitoring because IVA is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. 
IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, during coadministration with warfarin, additional monitoring of 
the international normalized ratio was recommended. Other medicinal products that are CYP2C9 
substrates for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these were 
used with caution.

Information about bronchodilator use during the study was collected and documented. Subjects 
who were using a bronchodilator had their spirometry assessments performed according to the 
guidelines.

exacerbations [PEx]) 
Exploratory: Fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) to assess 
exocrine pancreatic function 
Spirometry 
The following measured spirometric values were converted to percent predicted values using the 
standard equations of GLI: FEV1 (L), forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), FEV1/FVC (ratio), and forced 
expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (L/s). 
Multiple-breath Washout (N2-MBW)  
The final LCI value at each visit was the value provided by the LCI vendor based on the replicates. 
During the Screening Period, the MBW test could be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all other 
visits, all MBW tests were performed “pre-bronchodilator”  
Drug Acceptability Assessment 
The acceptability of study drug was assessed by the investigator and authorized designee through the 
Modified Facial Hedonic Scale. 
Subjects were observed for their facial expressions, and the reaction was scored using a visual analog 
scale; any spontaneous comments in regard to likes or dislikes were also noted.  
Sample size, Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Part A 
Approximately 12 subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) were planned for enrolment. 
Part B 
Approximately 56 subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) were planned for enrolment to ensure 
approximately 45 subjects completed Part B. Target enrolment was approximately 25 subjects with 
F/MF genotypes and 20 subjects with F/F genotypes.  
With 45 subjects expected to complete Part B, there is a 90% chance of observing an AE in at least 1 
subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a >95% chance of observing an AE in at least 1 subject if 
the true incidence rate is 10%. 
As all subjects were treated identically, no randomization was planned. 
This was an open-label study; however, subjects and their legally appointed and authorized 
representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) were not informed of their study-related spirometry and 
LCI, sweat chloride (SwCl), fecal elastase-1 (FE-1), and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) results 
during the Treatment Period, regardless of whether the subject permanently discontinued treatment. 
As study 106 is an open-label single arm trial, no formal sample size calculation, randomisation or 
blinding was performed by the MAH.

Efficacy and PD Analyses 
Part A 
Efficacy was not an objective of Part A. Descriptive statistics based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) were 
summarized for spirometry; SwCl; and weight, height, BMI, and their respective z-scores. 
Part B 
As efficacy is a secondary objective of the study, there was no multiplicity adjustment; all P values are 
considered nominal. 
Table 6. describes the main efficacy analyses based on the FAS. Each continuous efficacy and PD 
endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures that included visit as the 
fixed effect, with the baseline value of the efficacy variable and genotype group (F/F or F/MF) as 
covariates. The model included all measurements of the efficacy variable up to Week 24 (inclusive), 
whether assessed on treatment or after treatment discontinuation.

•  Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses were conducted for Parts A and B separately, based on data from the corresponding 
Treatment-emergent (TE) Period in the Safety Set (Table 7.). The overall safety profile of study drug 
was assessed in terms of the following safety and tolerability endpoints: treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory values, standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, and 
ophthalmologic examinations. All AEs were coded according to MedDRA and were classified as pre-
treatment, treatment-emergent, or post-treatment. Only descriptive analysis of safety was performed;

Vertex implemented safety measures to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue participation 
in Study 106 Part B while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to COVID-19 exposure through 
travel; the conduct of Part A was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These operational 
adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of 
subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP and minimizing 
impact to study integrity.  
Implemented measures were enabled based on the country and local regulations and site-level 
considerations (e.g., whether sites had subjects actively participating in Study 106, or site closures 
due to COVID-19). 
In particular, subjects who missed the Week 24 visit were requested to return and complete an 
unscheduled visit to capture safety laboratory testing missed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well 
as any AEs related to laboratory testing. If feasible, efficacy data (spirometry, SwCl, and LCI) were 
also collected at the same unscheduled visit, but this was not mandatory. 
In addition to their usual review of central laboratory data, investigators were responsible for reviewing 
local laboratory data to identify potential AEs. These data were entered into this database if all 
supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory certification) were received; available local laboratory data 
were provided in individual subject listings. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
The mean population age was 9.3 years, and over half (59.1%) of the subjects were female. The 
majority of subjects (87.9%) were White, and none were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 29 (43.9%) 
subjects had an F/F genotype, and 37 (56.1%) subjects had F/MF genotypes, with 15 distinct F/MF 
genotypes represented. At baseline, the mean ppFEV1 was 88.8% and mean SwCl was 102.2 mmol/L. 
The most common concomitant medications were typically used for the management of CF.

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Absolute Change in ppFEV1 
Part A 
Summary statistics for post-baseline raw values and changes from baseline are provided for ppFEV1 
and other lung function parameters; both absolute and relative changes are summarized. On Day 15, 
the within-group mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 11.8 (8.9) percentage 
points. 
Part B 
The main analysis of absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 (clinic assessed) is 
presented in Table 14 and Figure 4. 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in within-group improvements through Week 24. The LS mean 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 10.2 percentage points (95% CI: 7.9,

Sensitivity and Additional Analyses 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the multiple imputation method to assess for impact of 
missing data; MMRM results for the through Week 24 endpoint were consistent with the main analysis 
(Absolute change through Week 24 LS mean (SE) is 9.9 (1.0)) 
An additional prespecified analysis was performed that included home-assessed spirometry (i.e., 
spirometry assessed independently by the subjects at home) that was permitted due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The MMRM results for the through Week 24 endpoint were consistent with the main 
analysis: Absolute change through Week 24 LS mean (SE) is 10.7 (1.2). 
Another prespecified analysis included all clinic-assessed spirometry data collected through completion 
of study participation using the extended analysis visit windows (i.e., including data from unscheduled 
visits that were conducted after Week 24 to capture safety laboratory testing missed due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic). The MMRM results for the through Week 24 endpoint were consistent with the 
main analysis: Absolute change through Week 24 LS mean (SE) is 10.2 (1.3)).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support an indication extension of ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (Kalydeco) to include CF 
patients 6 through 11 years of age, the results of Study VX18-445-106 (Study 106) are submitted.  
Study 106 is a phase 3, multicentre study conducted in 2 parts to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age who are heterozygous

for F508del and a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F 
genotype).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In Part A of study 106, patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg FDC tablet and 
IVA 75 mg tablet for 15 days. 
In part B, patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks according to the following schedule: 
• 
• 
Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h (two Kaftrio 
50/25/37.5 mg FDC film-coated tablets in the morning and one Kalydeco 75 mg film-coated 
tablet in the evening) 
Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h (two Kaftrio 
100/50/75 mg FDC film-coated tablets in the morning and one Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated 
tablet in the evening) 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue the study 
drug could enrol in an optional open-label extension safety study (if they met the eligibility criteria for 
that study). 
Similar modification, interruption and discontinuation rules as well as prohibited medication rules are 
applied as for the adults in the initial marketing application studies and are considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (part A) and to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA through Week 24. Efficacy was a 
secondary objective.  
Endpoints 
As safety is the primary objective in Study 106 Part B, the proposed secondary efficacy endpoints are 
acceptable. Sweat chloride as a pharmacodynamic parameter is an important parameter for measuring 
the effect of a modulator. In CF, sweat chloride is increased and a decrease can be considered as an 
effect on the underlying pathology. Pulmonary function tests, spirometry and multiple breath wash-out 
(MBW) for calculating LCI2.5, are considered important to measure an effect on the lungs, one of the 
most important affected organs in CF. The LCI2.5 can measure changes in the small airways, while the 
ppFEV1 is more associated with large airways. In CF, the small airways are earlier affected than the 
large airways. Therefore, the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement of efficacy is sensitive, given the 
more preserved lung function in children than in adults. 
CFQ-R measures the quality of life, and changes in BMI z-score and height z-score inform over the 
nutritional status. Thus, all parameters inform about a different aspect of CF and are considered 
valuable.  
Statistics 
As study 106 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding 
was done. Considering, that acceptance of an extension of the indication could be based on similar 
exposure and safety and efficacy as in adolescents and adults, a within-group change from baseline is 
considered acceptable to provide evidence of comparable efficacy with adolescents and adults.  
Each continuous efficacy and PD endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures that included visit as the fixed effect, with a baseline value of the efficacy variable and

genotype group (F/F or F/MF) as covariates. The model included all measurements of the efficacy 
variable up to Week 24 (inclusive), whether assessed on treatment or after treatment discontinuation. 
For part B, safety measures were implemented to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue 
participation while ensuring their safety against COVID-19 exposure in alignment with Health Authority 
guidance. However, the adjustments made to comply with Health Authority guidance due to COVID-19 
potentially impact the results of the study results. Overall, the impact on safety results is expected to 
be minor provided that all the safety parameters were collected, but at a different time. For the 
efficacy data (i.e. spirometry, SwCl, and LCI) the impact is greater because it was not mandatory to 
collect these data at the same unscheduled visit. Giving patients the option to provide efficacy data 
through an unscheduled visit during the COVID-19 pandemic may have introduced additional biases 
because the ability and willingness to provide efficacy data during an unscheduled visit is likely to be 
associated with the health of the patient at the time.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 66 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of the study drug, and 64 (97.0%) 
subjects completed treatment and the study. One subject discontinued due to an AE, and 1 subject 
withdrew consent (not due to AE).  
The mean population age was 9.3 years, and over half (59.1%) of the subjects were female. The 
majority of subjects (87.9%) were White, and none were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 29 (43.9%) 
subjects had an F/F genotype, and 37 (56.1%) subjects had F/MF genotypes, with 15 distinct F/MF 
genotypes represented. About 50% of the patients has already an impaired lung function, as can be 
expected with these F/MF and F/F mutations, that affect the organs already in early life. 
Of the study population, 78.8% of the patients did not use a modulator before. For the patients with 
F/MF mutations no modulator therapy is currently authorised in patients aged 12 yo. However, for 
patients with F/F mutation, TEZ/IVA and LUM/IVA are available as modulator therapy, although 
TEZ/IVA became only quite recently available. As a consequence, the group of patients with F/F 
mutation consist of modulator experienced F/F subjects and modulator naïve F/F subjects.  
Outcomes and estimation  
As this was an open-label, single-arm study, the outcomes of the efficacy parameters were results 
compared to baseline.  
For the main secondary parameter ppFEV1, the LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through Week 24 was 10.2% (95% CI: 7.9, 12.6; P<0.0001). This is generally similar to the results 
for the adolescent and adult patients in previous studies performed by the MAH. In these studies, LS 
mean difference from baseline was 14.3 (95%CI 12.7, 15.8) in patients with F/MF mutations and 
7.8%, (95% CI 4.8,10.8) for CFTR modulator experienced F/F patients and 13.2%, (95% CI (8.5,17.9) 
for CFTR modulator naïve F/F patients. The benefit was thus different between the specific subgroups 
in the adult population, but still clinically relevant. Generally, lung function is better preserved in 
children compared to adults. Therefore, a slightly lower benefit would be acceptable. However, as 
normally a decrease in ppFEV1 will occur, an increase of 10.2% is undoubtfully clinically relevant.  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl 
from baseline through Week 24 of -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2; P<0.0001). This result is in 
line with results for the adolescent and adult patients in previous studies performed by the MAH: LS 
mean difference from baseline - 42.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.0, -40.4) in patients with F/MF mutations 
and LS mean difference from baseline was  -43.4 mmol/L (95% CI: -46.9, -40.0) for patients with F/F 
mutations. A reduction of -10 mmol/L in SwCl has been accepted by the CHMP as clinically relevant.  
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 51/86 
 
  
 
 
The within LS mean absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 7.0 points (95% CI: 4.7, 
9.2; P<0.0001) was clinically relevant, but less impressive compared with results for the adolescent 
and adult patients in the original marketing authorisation studies (patients with F/MF mutations 20.2 
points (95% CI 17.5,23.0) and patients with F/F mutations 17.4 points 95% CI 11.8,23.0)). However, 
in children, the quality of life was somewhat less impaired at the start (80 points) compared with the 
adults and adolescents (68.3 points and 70.6 in study 102 and study 103 respectively). Moreover, the 
child version of the CFQ-R is not completely identical to the adult version. Furthermore, COVID-19 
could also have influenced the outcome of the CFQ-R. Nevertheless, an increase of 7.0 points is above 
MCID of 4 points. Therefore, the results are considered clinically relevant. 
An improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is shown by a numerical decrease 
from baseline. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -1.71 
(95% CI: -2.11, -1.30; P<0.0001). The use of absolute change from baseline is preferred, because 
this endpoint will not mask deteriorations over time, if occurred. The additional analysis performed at 
the request of the CHMP of the LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 at week 12 showed that the change 
was -1.93 (95% CI -2.31, -1.56). A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 is not 
established. Therefore, an effect larger than the natural variability might be regarded as clinically 
relevant. The natural variability for the LCI2.5 is 1 unit3 or 15 % of baseline4. Therefore, the results 
are considered relevant by the CHMP.  
Not all of the 66 participants included in the FAS had data available at all time points because baseline 
results did not meet the criteria of acceptability. A requested multiple imputation-based method to 
account for these data if these four patients had any post-baseline data available were consistent with 
the primary analyses that excluded subjects with missing baseline. 
Regarding the post-baseline data, it is acknowledged that all reasonable efforts to collect data given 
the COVID-19 pandemic were made. However, despite the effort, the collection of data on the 
endpoints at week 16 and week 24 was hampered by the pandemic. At week 16, e.g. ppFEV1 data 
were available for 29 patients and at week 24 data were only available for 15 patients under the usual 
follow-up schedule and for 24 patients when patients who participated in an unscheduled visit were 
included. The inclusion of patient data from unscheduled visits is likely to introduce bias into the 
estimate of the outcome as these data may be from healthier, lower-risk patients. It is also noted that 
some of these data were collected much later than 24 weeks based on the timing of the unscheduled 
visits.  
Based on the accumulating evidence from previous studies, it is accepted that the effect of a 
modulator can already be observed around 4 to 8 weeks following treatment. At the request of the 
CHMP, rather than using additional analyses to try to reach a reasonable estimate of the within-group 
change through week 24, additional analyses excluding all Week 16 and 24 data were performed, that 
were consistent with the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R 
RD score, and LCI2.5, and that demonstrated a robust and clinically meaningful improvements. 
Because of the many missing data and the potential bias for the 24 weeks results, CHMP considered 
that both the results for 12 weeks and 24 weeks should be included in the SmPC.  
Some patients also had missing data up to week 12. Given the very high reported rate of study and 
treatment completion, the reasons why these data were missing were unclear. For the sensitivity 
analysis, given the way the missing categories were defined, only 2 participants would have been 
allocated to the missing category 1, for which it was assumed that the mean response at a particular

timepoint was the lower quartile of the observed data. The other participants had missing data 
imputed based on the mean of the observed data. Therefore, this sensitivity analysis is essentially 
making the same (MAR) assumptions as the MMRM model. Because the efficacy endpoints are 
secondary to the PK results and the lack of a control group limits the options for further sensitivity 
analysis, additional sensitivity analyses were not requested. Instead, at the request of the CHMP, to 
support the new analyses at week 12, the MAH provided the missing data patterns for the FAS 
population up to and including week 12, and where available, provided reasons for these missing data. 
Given the strength of the effect in both the week 12 and week 24 results, and the low number of 
“Category 1” discontinuations, no further analyses were deemed necessary by CHMP. 
Upon request from CHMP, subanalyses for the F/F and F/MF patient groups were presented by the 
MAH. The populations F/F and F/MF were comparably represented in the overall population. The results 
of both populations are generally in line with the overall group. The improvements were in both groups 
clinically meaningful. 
Indication 
The population of patients with F/MF or F/F genotypes investigated in Study 106 is tighter than the 
population for which Kalydeco, in combination with Kaftrio, has recently been authorised by the CHMP 
(EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0089). In this procedure, the indication was broadened to include CF patients 
from the age of 12 years with F/RF and F/G mutations to the already registered CF patients with F/F 
and F/MF mutations, resulting in the current indication of CF in  patients 12 years and older who have 
at least one F508del mutation in CFTR gene.   
Therefore, the CHMP requested the MAH to discuss whether the available clinical data for patients aged 
6 through 11 years with the F/F and F/MF mutations could be extrapolated to patients with F/Any 
mutations. This is discussed below.  
Principle of Extrapolation 
The extension of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients in line with the indication extension of 
Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) (EMEA/H/C/004682/X/0015). 
Consistent with the principles described in ICH E11, extrapolation of efficacy from adults to a younger 
population based on comparable PK exposures and safety is acceptable, because the disease process in 
CF patients of all age groups stems from a common aetiology of dysfunctional CFTR protein that is 
targeted by ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA. The defect of the defective chloride channels is 
already present at birth. Because ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA targets the dysfunctional CFTR, 
the outcome of therapy is expected to be comparable in younger age groups compared to adults.  
Extrapolation of efficacy is also supported by previously demonstrated efficacy in controlled studies of 
CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age treated with other CFTR modulators (LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA) in 
combination with Kalydeco (IVA), which was comparable to the effect observed in adults.  
This is also outlined in the EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) that describes the requirements of the application of the 
(partial) extrapolation, i.e., confirmation of the dose by PK study in children and bridging of safety and 
efficacy data in children.  
In conclusion, the further extrapolation to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/G and F/RF 
mutation is acceptable based on the same arguments as for the CF patients with F/F and F/MF 
mutations and taking into account the additional evidence of the statistically significant benefits of 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 53/86 
 
  
 
 
ELX/TEZ/IVA over previously available CFTR modulators (IVA or TEZ/IVA) in CF subjects ≥ 12 years of 
age with F/RF and F/G genotypes. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results in the efficacy endpoints generally support a benefit in the investigated population. 
However, the results are impacted by missing data because of the COVID-19 pandemic and related 
restrictions during the later stage of the study. As known from previous trials, by week 12, steady and 
reliable results can already be observed. The analyses excluding all Week 16 and 24 data, were 
consistent with the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD 
score, and LCI2.5, and demonstrated a robust and clinically meaningful improvements.  
The extension of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old who are heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype)  
is based on the principle of partial extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients. The 
principle of partial extrapolation can be considered justified in CF for the CFTR therapies, because of 
the similar underlying genetic, and molecular aetiology of CF of children and patients ≥ 12 years. 
Children and adults share the same disease characteristics although they are more severe in adults 
because of the progression of the symptoms. Efficacy is a secondary objective in this application. The 
extrapolation is based on comparable exposure and safety.  
Further, extrapolation of efficacy data in CF patients with F/F and F/MF mutations to CF subjects 6 
through 11 years of age with F/G and F/RF mutation is acceptable considering also the additional 
evidence of the statistically significant benefits of ELX/TEZ/IVA over previously available CFTR 
modulators (IVA or TEZ/IVA) in CF subjects ≥ 12 years of age with F/RF and F/G genotypes. 
Thus, the following extended indication for Kalydeco is considered acceptable by the CHMP:  
Kalydeco is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for the 
treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who 
have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The clinical safety of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio was previously assessed in the clinical study 
in patients aged ≥ 12 years.  
The main clinical safety database to support the application in children aged 6 through 11 years 
includes the safety data from Study 106, a Phase 3, single arm, multi-centre study conducted in 2 
parts (Parts A and B) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in 
CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age who are homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype) or 
heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF genotypes).  
Only data from this paediatric study was provided. No integrated safety report has provided including 
the comparison with adult and adolescent patients. The treatment duration in part A of the study was 
relatively short, thus the core safety analyses are provided from part B, where patients were treated 
for 24 weeks. The safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments, 
standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical examinations, and ophthalmologic 
examinations (OEs).  
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 54/86 
 
  
 
 
Patients who completed study 106, were offered the opportunity to enrol in Study 107, a 96-week 
open-label extension study, in which they continue receiving treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The study is 
currently ongoing and data will be submitted in the post-approval setting (by Q1 2023).

The study VX18-445-106 took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects who missed the Week 
24 visit were requested to return and complete an unscheduled visit to capture safety laboratory 
testing missed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any AEs related to laboratory testing. 
Patient exposure 
Study VX18-445-106 consists of two parts. In Part A, all patients received the same dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA and IVA. In part B, the patients received a weight-based posology based on the provided 
PK data of Part A.  
Part A  
A total of 16 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Part A treatment period. The mean 
(SD) exposure was 14.9 (0.68) days (Table 28). 
Part B  
A total of 66 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Part B treatment Period, with a 
mean (SD) exposure of 23.8 (3.0) weeks (Table 29).

Adverse events 
Adverse events part A and part B 
The AEs generated in study VX18-445-106 are briefly summarized in Table below. During the study, 
there were no deaths reported. Most adverse events were well tolerated.  
A total of one patient experience serious AEs (pneumonia, metapneumovirus infection, and rhinovirus 
infection), and one patient experienced an AE (rash erythematous) discontinuation. Two patients 
experienced AEs (one patient rash maculo-papular; one patient diarrhea, pyrexia, and vomiting), that 
led to interruption of treatment (Table 30).

Adverse events of special interest  
Adverse events of special interests were AEs of elevated transaminases, rash and ophthalmic 
examinations.  AESIs of elevated transaminases and rash occurred in both parts of the study, 
however, no subjects had AEs of cataract or lens opacity (see below).  
- 
Elevated Transaminase Events 
In part A, one subject (1/16, 6.3%) with a history of liver function test increased had a nonserious AE 
of transaminases increased 1 day after the last dose of study drug treatment; the AE was considered 
by the investigator to be mild in severity and possibly related to study drug  
In part B, most patients had ALT and AST levels that remained in the normal range. Seven (10.6%) 
subjects had elevated transaminase events. All events were mild or moderate in severity. None of the 
events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. The elevated transaminase 
events had a mean (SD) duration of 15.3 (9.0) days, and the mean (SD) time-to-onset of first event 
was 52.1 (62.2) days.

In part A, five subjects (5/16, 31.3%) had a total of 6 rash events. All events were mild in severity, 
were nonserious, and had an outcome of recovered/resolved. One subject had an AE of rash maculo-
papular that led to study drug interruption. 
In Part B, sixteen (24.2%) subjects had at least 1 rash event. Of these 16 subjects, most subjects had 
rash events that were assessed as either not related or unlikely related to study drug and/or had 
alternative etiologies (e.g., due to viral infection or heat exposure). All rash events were mild or 
moderate in severity.  
One subject had a rash event of moderate severity that led to treatment discontinuation. 
All other rashes resolved without treatment discontinuation or interruption. The rash events had a 
mean (SD) duration of 6.0 (5.5) days, and the mean (SD) time-to-onset of first event was 22.7 (31.3) 
days.  
By sex, 11 (28.2%) female subjects and 5 (18.5%) male subjects had rash events 
-  Ophthalmologic examinations (Part B).  
Ophthalmologic examination occurred at screening and at the end of treatment. No subjects had AEs 
of cataract or lens opacity.  
Not all patients of part B underwent a post-treatment ophthalmologic examination because of the 
COVID pandemic. The number of patients that underwent ophthalmologic examination before and after 
treatment is not reported.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
During the study VX18-445-106, one SAE occurred in Part B of the study in one subject. The event 
was assessed as moderate in severity and unlikely related to study drug, did not lead to study 
treatment discontinuation or interruption, and resolved. This event is considered unlikely to be related 
to treatment.  
No deaths occurred during the study.  
Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
Part A 
In part A, there were no trends observed in the Liver Function Test and non-Liver Function Test 
chemistry parameters. No subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN in the TE Period, nor total bilirubin >2 × 
ULN. 
Part B 
In part B, most subjects had ALT and AST values that remained within the normal range. Mean 
concentrations of LFT parameters were variable, without consistent trends over time in ALT, AST, ALP, 
or GGT values. 
Seven (10.6%) subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN, and 1 (1.5%) subject had ALT or AST >5 × ULN; 
no subjects had ALT or AST >8 × ULN. No subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with concurrent total 
bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN (Table 35). 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 62/86 
 
  
 
 
Most subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range (Table 35); One (1.5%) 
subject had 2 AEs of blood bilirubin increased, neither of which were serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation or interruption. In one patient the AE was considered related to treatment. 
No subjects had AEs of GGT increased or ALP increased, although the lab assessment showed 
elevations of GGT and ALP above the threshold values.

Note: Within each parameter, a subject was counted in all applicable post-baseline categories based on the worst 
assessment during the TE Period in Part B. Percentages were evaluated as n/N1. Threshold criteria involving 2 LFT 
parameters could be determined by assessments at different visits during the TE Period 
Creatine Kinase 
The mean CK concentration was variable over time; overall, increases from baseline were observed. 
The mean (SD) increase in CK ranged from 30.2 (32.7) U/L at Week 12 to 53.4 (68.8) U/L at Week 24  
Most subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range; a total of 21 (31.8%) subjects had 
CK levels > ULN to ≤ 2.5 ULN, 4 (6.1%) subjects had CK levels >2.5 × ULN, and no subjects had CK 
levels >5 × ULN.

AEs of CK elevation occurred in 2 (3.0%) subjects; in one patient it was considered to be related to 
medication (Table 34). Neither AE was serious or led to study drug discontinuation or interruption, and 
both AEs resolved without treatment. 
Haemaotology 
Minor decreases from baseline in mean platelets, leukocytes, and neutrophils were observed: mean 
values of these parameters were not below the respective normal range at any assessed time point.  
Two subjects had mild AEs related to haematology findings (1 subject with leukopenia, 1 subject with 
white blood cell count increased); none of the AEs were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or 
interruption. 
Coagulopathy  
There were no trends observed in coagulation parameters. Three subjects had AEs related to 
coagulation findings considered not to be related to treatment; none of the AEs were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Vital signs  
All patients (100%) in part A and a total of n= 33 (50% of the safety set) patients in part B completed 
the safety measurements (blood pressure, ECG) at the end of the treatment period. 
Decreases from baseline in pulse rate were observed. The mean (SD) decrease in pulse rate ranged 
from -1.8 (10.9) bpm at Week 16 to -4.8 (13.6) bpm at Week 4. There were no other trends observed 
in other vital signs parameters, including BP. No subjects had AEs related to Blood pressure of pulse 
rate findings.  
One subject had an AE of defect conduction intraventricular, which was nonserious, not related to 
study drug, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption; no other subjects had AEs 
related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
All patients in part A completed the study.  
One patient (1.5%) in part B discontinued prematurely due to adverse events. This subject had a 
treatment related AE of rash erythematous of moderate severity. The study drug was withdrawn, and a 
single dose of cetirizine was administered: the event resolved the next day.  
Treatment interruptions due to AEs  
The treatment was temporarily interrupted in two patients: one in part A and one in part B.  
In part A, one (6.3%) subject had an AE of rash maculo-papular of mild intensity. The AE resolved; the 
subject resumed ELX/TEZ/IVA and completed dosing. The AE was considered unrelated to treatment.  
In part B, the treatment was temporarily interrupted in one patient because of AEs unlikely to be 
related to medication. The dose of ivacaftor was interrupted for one day and the event resolved.  
Comparisons of the safety profile in patients aged ≥ 12 and patients aged 6 through 11 
years old  
Upon request from CHMP, the MAH provided a comparison of the adverse events observed in the 
paediatric population (children aged 6 through 11 years) and the patients aged ≥ 12 years. 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 64/86 
 
  
 
 
The safety data for the paediatric population is obtained in study 106 part B. The safety for the 
patients aged ≥ 12 years is obtained in study 102. As both studies were of the same duration, the 
comparison of the AE incidence data is provided.  
Comparisons overall safety profile  
The overall adverse event profile by number of AE’s, treatment related AE, discontinuations etc.  show 
a comparable number of events are comparable between the paediatric population and the patients 
aged ≥ 12 years (Table 36).

Adverse event irrespective of causal relationship  
In addition, to the overall adverse event profile, also a comparison of the AE by SoC and PT were 
presented, irrespective of the causal relationship 
In the paediatric population, the following SoC showed a higher frequency (≥ 5%) compared to 
the ≥ 12 year old population i.e.:

SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal i.e. 73% vs 50% 
SOC General disorders and administration site conditions 29% vs 16%  
In the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal adverse events, the largest difference in the 
AE (PT) is shown by the PT cough 42% vs 17%, nasal congestion (15% vs 9%), oropharyngeal pain (~ 
18% vs 10%) and rhinorhoea (~12 vs 8%). 
In the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions, the differences between the 
paediatric and adult population (29% vs 17%) is driven by the higher reported frequency of pyrexia 
(21% vs, 8%). In the paediatric population, none of the adverse events were considered being related 
to study medication. 
The SOC Investigations showed a higher reported frequency of the PT blood creatine phosphokinase 
increase in the population aged ≥ 12 years (9.4% vs 3%) compared the paediatric population

Table made by assessor in Kaftrio X/08/G procedure, The patients in study 102 are aged ≥ 12 years, 
in study 106 aged 6 through 11 years. Selection of the SoC and PT is based on the drug reported AE in study 
106B and the incidence of n≥ 1 in study 102.  
Differences in frequency of drug related adverse events  
Upon request, on overview of the drug related adverse event was provided (Table 38). 
In the paediatric population, most drug related AE’s were reported in the SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders (18.2%), followed by the SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (16.7%), SOC 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.1%) and SOC investigations (10.6%). 
For the ≥ 12 year old population, this frequency was SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal 
disorders (14.4%), SOC investigations (12%), the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (10%), and Skin 
disorders (8.1%).

Table made by assessor in Kaftrio X/08/G procedure, The patients in study 102 are aged ≥ 12 years, 
in study 106 aged 6 through 11 years. Selection of the SoC and PT is based on the drug reported AE in 
study 106B and the incidence of n≥ 2 in study 102.  
Adverse event of Specific Interest 
Adverse events of special interests were AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs, rash and ocular lens 
opacity. As none of the paediatric patient had an AEsi of coular opacity, this will not be discussed 
furtherhere.  
AESI transaminase elevation  
A cross study comparison of the AESi of transaminase elevation is provided in table 39.  The 
data show, that the occurrence of the AEsi (ALAT or ASAT ≥ 3 × ULN) were slightly higher in 
the paediatic population (10.6%) compared with the patients ≥ 12 years (7.9%). None of the 
paediatric patients reported ALT>3 × ULN or AST>3 × ULN) and TBILI>2 × ULN.

AESI Rash  
The generalised AEsi Rash included the PT Rash, PT Rash generalised, Rash macular, Rash pruritic, 
Rash erythematous, Rash maculo-papular and Rash papular. 
The paediatric population showed an approximately 2 times higher reported frequency reported than in 
the ≥ 12 year old population for both AEsi-Rash-irrespective-of-causality (24.2 vs 10.9%), and the 
AEsi-Rash-treatment-related (12.1% vs 6.9%). 
Post marketing experience 
As of 20 October 2020, it is estimated that 23,556 patients (representing 13,467.1 person-years) have 
been exposed to ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA through worldwide commercial access. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety data set to support the application in in children aged 6 through 11 consist of the 
safety data of part B of the single arm, open label study VX18-445-106, where 66 patients were 
treated for 24 weeks.  
The provided safety data set to support the application is considered limited to support a medicinal 
product intended for chronic use. Also, because of COVID pandemic, not all patients underwent a full 
safety measurement after completion of the study.  
In addition to its limited data set size and treatment duration, the safety data is collected in an 
uncontrolled, open-label study, in which the contribution from the longer disease duration is hard to 
distinguish from the longer drug exposure. Upon CHMP request, a cross study comparison of the safety 
profile obtained in the paediatric population and the patients aged ≥ 12 years was provided to support 
the safety profile obtained in the paediatric population. 
Overall, the provided paediatric safety set shows that the treatment appears well tolerated up to 24 
weeks in the paediatric population, as shown by the reported low number of serious adverse events 
(1.5%), treatment interruptions (1.5%) and treatment discontinuations due to AE (1.5%). Similarly to 
the patients aged ≥ 12 years, the treatment appears well tolerated and the safety profile is overall 
consistent with the known safety profile of these products.  
There is an open-label extension roll over study 107 currently ongoing which should provide an 
opportunity to collect the missing safety data. This study will provide more prolonged safety data (up 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 71/86 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 96 weeks), although the included paediatric patients number will still be limited (n=64). The data 
will need to be submitted once the study is completed (by Q1 2023). 
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths  
Nearly all paediatric patients (98.5%) experienced an adverse event. The reported adverse events 
were most likely related to common manifestation of CF disease or common illnesses.  
About 50% of patients experienced an adverse event that was considered to be related to treatment 
by the investigator. 
A different ranking in the number or treatment related adverse events was observed between the 
paediatric and ≥ 12-year-old population. In the paediatric population, most drug related AE’s were 
reported In the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (18.2%), followed by the SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal disorders (16.7%), SOC Skin disorders (12.1%) and SOC investigations (10.6%). 
For the population aged ≥ 12 years, most drug related AEs were observed in the SOC Respiratory, 
Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (14.4%), followed by the SOC investigations (12.9%), the SOC 
Gastrointestinal disorders (10.9%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (8.9%). 
This ranking of the SoC is on the one hand not unexpected, as the population aged ≥ 12 years suffers 
more from advanced pulmonary disease, while in the paediatric population gastro-intestinal might be 
more prominent. However, the data may also indicate that paediatric population might be more 
vulnerable to skin related adverse events (see also AE of Specific interest).  
Some new treatment-related adverse events were noted in the paediatric population. These adverse 
events were most like of mild intensity and could also be considered as signs and symptoms of CF or 
other as symptoms of common disease manifestations (e.g., vomiting, cough, sputum increased, 
bronchospasm, haemoptysis, pleuritic pain, bilirubin increased, aggression, anxiety, depressed mood, 
and fatigue). Most of these events were reported as related or possible related to a single subject, mild 
to moderate in intensity and resolved upon ongoing use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA. 
Therefore, they should not be mentioned in the ADR table of section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Cough (n=28) was reported in more subjects in the paediatric population. However, these CF related 
adverse events were not reported with a higher frequency in the ≥ 12 year old population compared 
with placebo. Therefore, the CHMP considered that they do not need to be included in SmPC section 
4.8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Adverse events of special interest  
In the adult and adolescent trials, identified adverse events of specific interest were transaminase 
elevation and rash . These adverse events of interest are also applicable to the paediatric population. 
Transaminase elevations 
Transaminase elevations occur frequently in paediatric patients with CF and the inclusion of patients 
with transaminase elevation was limited to patients with ALT or AST < 3 × ULN. During the trial, the 
patients were regularly monitored. The reported incidence of transaminase elevation was (10.6%), in 
none of the patients did it lead to treatment discontinuation or treatment interruption.  
The cross-study comparison with the safety data obtained in the patients aged ≥ 12 years showed a 
slightly higher incidence of transaminase elevation with the paediatric population (10.6%) compared 
with the patients aged ≥ 12 years (7.9%). Unlike the patients aged ≥ 12 years, none of the paediatric 
population showed ALT>3 × ULN or AST>3 × ULN) and TBILI>2 × ULN. 
The cross-study comparison with the safety data obtained in the Symkevi trials (9.2%) and 
Orkambi trials (9.8%) revealed a comparable incidence of transaminase elevation (10.6%). 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 72/86 
 
  
 
 
However, these cross-study comparisons are hampered because the exclusion criteria in the 
Kaftrio trials were more stringent and the longer observation period for Symkevi. In the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA trials, patients were excluded when 1 out of the defined impairments were 
present instead of 2 (Symkevi) or 3 (Orkambi) trial, while the observation period for Symkevi 
was extended to 48 weeks.  
Therefore, these indirect cross study comparisons indicate that the risk of AEsi-transaminase-
elevated might be somewhat higher with Kaftrio compared to other CTFR modulators. 
Hepatoxicity is an important identified risk. Following a recent variation, the SmPC includes a 
warning for frequent ASAT/ALAT and bilirubin monitoring. Considering that these paediatric 
patients are treated in specialized clinics and will be frequently monitored, this risk appears to 
be sufficiently covered.  
Rash 
Similarly to the adult and adolescent studies, treatment related rash occurred frequently (n=8, 12.1% 
in part B). It resulted in discontinuation of treatment in one patient in part B of the study.  
The cross-study comparison with the adult and adolescent data revealed that frequency of rash 
in the paediatric population was twice the frequency reported in the patients aged ≥ 12 years  
for both the AESI Rash-irrespective-of-causal-relationship  (24.2% vs 10.9%), as well as the 
treatment-related Rash (12.1% vs 6.9%).  
The current SmPC reports the AE-rash already as a very common adverse drug reaction (≥ 10%) in 
section 4.8. Therefore, no adjustment to the SmPC is considered necessary.  
Ocular lens opacity 
None of the patients reported AE’s related to ocular lens opacity. However, ocular lens opacities occur 
gradually and as such might be underreported. Therefore, patients have to be examined before and 
after treatment. However, the study was conducted in the COVID-19 pandemic and not all patients 
underwent a post treatment ophthalmic examination. Most patients (n=64) rolled over to the open 
label extension study 107, which also includes ophthalmic examinations. The results of this study 
should be submitted once available (by Q1 2023). 
Incomplete safety measurements at end study due to COVID-19 pandemic   
The study took place during the COVID pandemic, which might provide an explanation that no compete 
safety assessment including vital signs, ECG and ophthalmic examination was conducted in the 
complete safety population.  
Data from 33 patients (50% of safety data set) were provided for the vital signs and ECG, while for an 
unknown number of patients’ results are provided for the additional ophthalmologic examination. The 
currently provided data do not raise concerns but are too limited to be conclusive. Nevertheless, the 
generated paediatric safety data base can be supported with the generated safety profile obtained in 
patients aged ≥ 12 years, while additional long-term safety data will be provided (> 24 weeks) from 
the long-term roll over study 107.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with Kalydeco is intended for chronic use. The provided paediatric safety 
data set is limited, both in patient numbers (n=66) and duration of treatment i.e. 24 weeks. In 
addition, the safety data is obtained in an uncontrolled, open label, arm study in which the contribution 
from the longer disease duration versus the longer drug exposure is hard to distinguish.  
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 73/86 
 
  
 
 
The current safety data show that the treatment appears also to be well tolerated in patients from 6 
years of age, however it is noted that the AESI Rash occurs twice more often in younger children 
compared to the older population.  
The transaminase elevation occurred in the paediatric population with comparable incidence as for 
older patients aged ≥ 12 years. It is an important identified risk and the SmPC contains sufficient 
recommendations for frequent monitoring.  
In conclusion, the currently provided data set shows that the product is generally well tolerated, but 
the safety set is of limited duration (24 weeks) for a medicinal product intended for chronic use. 
Therefore, the additional long-term safety data from study 107 should be provided once the data 
becomes available (by Q1 2023).  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which were 
accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
limited changes introduced in this application. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by 
mutations in the CFTR gene that result in the absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the 
cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 76/86 
 
  
 
 
 
 
of salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs 
results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Lung disease is the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in people with CF. F508del, is the most common disease-causing mutation 
(84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% of the individuals in Europe)5,6. 
In this current variation, the following indication was initially claimed: 
Kalydeco, is indicated in a combination regimen with elexacftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or 
heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the treatment of CF, two main types of therapies can be distinguished, i.e CF therapies that target 
the symptoms of the disease (such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics), and  CFTR 
modulators (i.e. correctors and potentiators) that maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk 
of infections and exacerbations; and improve quality of life.  
Correctors (such as tezacaftor and elexacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
mutant CFTR to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced 
chloride transport. CFTR potentiators (like ivacaftor) enhance the channel gating activity of the CFTR 
which is delivered to the cell surface (by correctors).  
Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ELX/TEZ/IVA) is indicated in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor (Kalydeco) 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years 
and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and 
Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific 
mutations.  
The registered indication in patients aged 12 years and older covers F/F genotypes, F/MF ‘minimal 
function’ genotypes, F/G ‘gating’ genotypes, and F/RF ‘residual function’ genotypes.  
In children 6 through 11 years of age, approved modulator therapies are available for F508del 
homozygous patients (F/F), patient heterozygous for F508del and a specific residual function mutation 
(F/RF) or a specific gating mutation (F/G). Nevertheless, these treatments do not cure the disease and 
more efficacious treatments could fulfil this gap in these patients. For the populations heterozygous for 
F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) no treatment is available, which is an unmet need in 
this subpopulation. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support an indication extension of ELX/TEZ/IVA to include CF patients 6 through 11 years of age 
with F/F or F/MF mutation, the efficacy and safety data of one clinical trial, study VX18-445-106 are 
submitted. The pharmacokinetics of ELX/TEZ/IVA is also investigated in study 106 that confirmed the 
dosing.

Study 106 is conducted in 2 parts (Parts A and B) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype).  
Study 106 Part A evaluated ELX 100 mg once daily (qd)/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg every 12 hours 
(q12h), which is half the dose that is approved for use in CF patients ≥12 years of age. Simulations 
were conducted to select a dosing regimen and the updated popPK models, which included PK data 
from adults, adolescents, and all Study 106 to confirm the proposed dosing regimen for Study 106 Part 
B. 
Study 106 part B evaluated the safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in 24 weeks. The recommended 
total daily dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA for patients 6 through 11 years of age was evaluated, i.e.  
• 
• 
Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h (two Kaftrio 
50/25/37.5 mg FDC film-coated tablets in the morning and one Kalydeco 75 mg film-coated 
tablet in the evening) 
Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h (in form of two 
Kaftrio 100/50/75 mg FDC film-coated tablets in the morning and one Kalydeco 150 mg film-
coated tablet in the evening) 
The primary objective was safety; efficacy was secondary objective.  
The secondary endpoints included spirometry and sweat chloride (SwCl), weight, height, body mass 
index (BMI) and associated z-scores, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), multiple-breath 
washout.  
The extension of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients.  Consistent with the principles 
described in ICH E11 and EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018), extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger 
paediatric patients may be possible when a medicinal product is to be used in younger paediatric 
patients for the same indication as those studied in older paediatric patients, the disease process is 
similar, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be comparable. In CF, the disease process in all age 
groups stems from a common aetiology of dysfunctional CFTR protein that is targeted by ELX/TEZ/IVA 
and because ELX/TEZ/IVA targets the dysfunctional CFTR, the outcome of therapy is expected to be 
comparable in younger age groups compared to adults. Pharmacokinetic studies in the relevant age 
groups of paediatric patients likely to receive the medicinal product, together with safety studies, may 
be sufficient to provide adequate information for paediatric use.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dosing 
The results of Study 106 and popPK based simulations demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 
years of age the distributions of individual ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures, applying a dose of ELX 100 
mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h dose in patients <30 kg and a dose of ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 
mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h in patients weighing ≥30 kg, were within the range of those observed in 
subjects ≥18 years of age.  
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 78/86 
 
  
 
 
  
 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off for the applied 
dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. 
Efficacy  
For the main secondary parameter ppFEV1, the LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through Week 24 was 10.2 percentage points (95% CI: 7.9, 12.6; p<0.0001). This is generally similar 
to the results in the adolescent and adult patients in the original marketing authorisation studies, when 
LS mean difference from baseline was 14.3 (95%CI 12.7, 15.8) in patients with F/MF mutations and 
7.8%, (95% CI 4.8,10.8) for CFTR modulator experienced F/F patients and 13.2%, (95% CI (8.5,17.9) 
for CFTR modulator naïve F/F patients.  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (Kalydeco) resulted in the LS mean absolute 
change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 of -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2; p<0.0001). 
These results is in line with results for the adolescent and adult patients in the original marketing 
authorisation studies (LS mean difference from baseline - 42.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.0, -40.4) in 
patients with F/MF mutations and LS mean difference from baseline was  -43.4 mmol/L (95% CI: -
46.9, -40.0) and for patients with F/F mutations.  
The within LS mean absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 7.0 points (95% CI: 4.7, 
9.2; P<0.0001) was relevant, but less compared with results for the adolescent and adult patients in 
the original marketing authorisation studies (patients with F/MF mutations 20.2 points (95% CI 
17.5,23.0) and patients with F/F mutations 17.4 points 95% CI 11.8,23.0).  
An improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is shown by a numerical decrease 
from baseline. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -1.71 
(95% CI: -2.11, -1.30; P<0.0001). The natural variability for the LCI2.5 is 1 unit7 or 15 % of 
baseline8. Therefore, the results are considered relevant.  
Upon request from the CHMP, results at week 12 were also provided. The LS mean absolute change in 
ppFEV1 from baseline through week 12 was 9.6 percentage points (95% CI: 7.3, 11.9). Treatment 
with Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from 
baseline through Week 12 of -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -56.1). The within LS mean absolute 
change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score was 5.6 points (95% CI: 2.9, 8.2). The LS mean absolute 
change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 12 was -1.83 (95% CI: -2.18, -1.49). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients were unable to provide data on the efficacy 
endpoints toward the end of the study. Further, baseline data also appear to be missing for a small 
number of patients.  
Despite the effort to collect as much efficacy data as possible, collection of data on the endpoints at 
week 16 and week 24 was hampered by the pandemic, and the option to provide efficacy data at an 
unscheduled visit that was intended to supplement week 24 data may have introduced bias into the 
estimate of the outcome as these data may be from healthier, lower-risk patients. Nevertheless, given 
the effect of a modulator on some parameters can already be observed around 4 to 8 weeks following 
treatment, additional analyses on the difference in the change through week 12 with all week 16 and 
week 24 data excluded from the analysis for all secondary endpoints were presented by the MAH upon 
request from the CHMP.

These analyses were consistent with the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, 
SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5, and demonstrate a robust and clinically meaningful improvements. 
Based on the information provided on treatment discontinuation, the sensitivity analysis is essentially 
making the same (MAR) assumptions as the MMRM model. The lack of a control group limits the 
options for further sensitivity analysis.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is mainly determined by part B of the study, where 66 patients were treated for 24 
weeks. The most frequently reported AEs (by PT are) were cough (n=28, 42.4%), headache (n=16, 
24.2%) and pyrexia (n=14, 21.2%).  
Most frequently treatment related AEs were was abdominal pain (n=6, 9.1%), followed by alanine 
aminotransferase increase (n=5, 7.6%), rash (n=4, 6.1%) and headache (n= 4, 6.1%). 
One patient prematurely discontinued treatment because of an adverse event i.e. rash erythematous.  
In two patients, treatment was temporality interrupted because of adverse events, i.e. rash maculo-
papular, diarrhea, pyrexia, and vomiting.   
Adverse events of specific interest were transaminase elevation and rash. A total of 7 (10.6%) 
paediatric patients experienced elevations of transaminases, and 16 (24.2%) experienced a rash.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main safety data set to support the application is of limited size in patient numbers (n=66) as well 
as in the duration of treatment i.e. 24 weeks. In addition, the safety data is obtained in an 
uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm study, in which the contribution from the longer disease duration 
is hard to distinguish from longer drug exposure.  
The cross-study comparison shows the same frequency of transaminase elevation as with the other 
CFTR modulators Lumacaftor and Symkevi, although the exclusion criteria for patients with pre-
existing liver function impairments were more stringent in ELX/TEZ/IVA studies compared to the 
Orkambi trials and Symkevi, and a prolonged observation period with the Symkevi trial.    
The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in an incomplete end of trial 
safety measurement. At the end of the trial, ECG and vital signs were conducted in 33 (50% of safety 
data set) subjects. 
After completion of study 106, patients were invited to participate in the long-term safety study 107 of 
96 weeks duration. A total of 64 patients rolled over. Additional long-term safety data will be provided 
once available (by Q1 2023).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of the favourable effects  
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off for the applied 
dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. 
The LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 of 10.2% (95% CI: 7.9, 
12.6;) is well above the accepted MCID in this population of approximately 2%. The results are 
considered clinically relevant.  
The LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 of -60.9 mmol/l (95% CI: -
63.7, -58.2) is also well above the accepted MCID of approximately 10 mmol/l. The results are 
considered clinically relevant. 
Strength of the evidence  
Pulmonary exacerbations and decline of lung function have an impact on survival in cystic fibrosis and 
reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions of the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of the treatment of cystic fibrosis. ppFEV1 as a surrogate 
endpoint is a well-established endpoint and a reduction in the decline of FEV1 is related to improved 
survival. Observed improvements in ppFEV1 and SwCl were consistent with previous results in adults 
and adolescent populations. The results of ppFEV1 and SwCl are supported by all secondary 
parameters. CFQ-R respiratory domain, BMI z-score showed improvements well above the MCID. 
Results based on analyses using data through week 12 supported conclusions of a clinically meaningful 
effect. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
Not all known MF mutations can be tested in a clinical trial as in adult studies. The clinical benefit seen 
in the investigated F/MF patients has such a large effect size, that it was accepted that results of in the 
tested MF mutations can be extrapolated to all MF mutations. Moreover, additional studies in adults in 
F/G and F/RF mutations have established that ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (Kalydeco) is 
effective in all classes of mutations in the presence of at least one F508del mutation. Although not 
tested, in children a similar efficacy can be expected and extrapolation of efficacy is acceptable from 
paediatric patients with MF mutations to patients with at least one F508Del mutation.  
Safety 
In the adult clinical programs, ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (Kalydeco) appeared to be well-
tolerated, both in the short term and in the long-term safety studies. The reported treatment-related 
adverse events in the paediatric population generally aligned with the reported events in patients aged 
≥ 12 years. 
Similarly to patients ≥ 12 years, the AESI rash occurred very frequently. In the paediatric population 
the AEsi Rash occurred twice as often compared with the patients aged ≥ 12 year. No adjustment of 
the SmPC is needed, because rash is already reported as a very common adverse drug reaction. 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 83/86 
 
  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported related adverse event was abdominal pain, followed by alanine 
aminotransferase elevation. In children, hepatic impairment and transaminase elevations appear to 
occur slightly more frequently (10.6%) than in adults and adolescents (7.9%), but this is acceptable. 
The cross-study comparisons suggest a somewhat higher risk with Kaftrio for transaminase elevations 
than with other CFTR modulators, but head-to-head comparative data is missing. Like in adults and 
adolescents, the transaminases and bilirubin should be closely monitored, as already mentioned in the 
SmPC section 4.4.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
This extension of indication to children 6 through 11 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients. This application also needs to be 
supported by comparable PK exposures, acceptable safety and a similar PD effect.   
Indication  
The population of patients with F/MF or F/F genotypes investigated in Study 106 is tighter than the 
population for which Kaftrio, in combination with Kalydeco, has recently been authorised for the older 
age group, i.e. CF patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation in CFTR gene.  
Following approval of the above indication in parallel of this application and upon agreement from the 
CHMP, the therapeutic indication was amended to “combination regimen with kaftrio for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene”.  
The further extrapolation to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/G and F/RF mutation is 
justified based on the same arguments presented and accepted as for the CF patients with F/F and 
F/MF mutations. Additional evidence of the statistically significant benefits of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 
previously available CFTR modulators (IVA or TEZ/IVA) in CF subjects ≥ 12 years of age with F/RF and 
F/G genotypes was also provided. 
Dosing  
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off for the applied 
dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. 
Efficacy  
In this study in CF patients 6 through 11 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del and a minimal 
function mutation or homozygous for F508del mutation, efficacy was a secondary objective. The 
extrapolation is based on comparable exposure and safety.  
Clinically relevant improvements were found in the changes from baseline for the ppFEV1 and SwCl. 
These improvements were consistent with previous results in adults and adolescent populations, 
confirming the justification of partial extrapolation.  
Although many data were missing for the main statistical analysis, additional analyses on the change 
through week 12 with all week 16 and week 24 data excluded from the analysis were consistent with 
the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5, 
and demonstrated a robust and clinically meaningful improvements.  
Safety 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 84/86 
 
  
 
 
The provided data show that the treatment appears to be well tolerated in the paediatric population. 
The reported safety profile generally appears to align with the reported data obtained in the population 
aged ≥ 12 years, but the data set was rather small (n=66), of limited duration ( 24 weeks)  and is 
further hampered by missing data at the end of treatment safety follow-up due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The ongoing, extension study 107 will provide additional long-term safety and results will 
be provided upon completion (by Q1 2023).    
Nevertheless, the safety profile of adult patients is well described, and the currently provided data did 
not identify new important risks. As expected, the paediatric population reported the highest frequency 
of adverse events in the SoC Gastro-intestinal tract, while in the patients aged ≥ 12 years Respiratory 
events were more frequently reported.  
Similarly to patients ≥ 12 years, the AESI rash occurred very frequently. The elevation of 
transaminases occurred slightly more frequently in the paediatric population compared to patients 
aged ≥ 12 years (10.6% vs 7.9%). Hepatotoxicity is already identified as an important potential risk. 
The earlier introduction of the modulator therapy might be beneficial, as this modulator therapy has 
the potential to prevent the long-standing detrimental effects of CF. Considering that these paediatric 
patients are treated in specialized clinics and frequently monitored, more uncertainties regarding the 
safety profile are considered acceptable and manageable in clinical practice. In addition, the safety will 
be further substantiated in the follow-up extension study 107. Overall the safety profile is considered 
acceptable.

Extension of indication for Kalydeco tablets in combination regiment with Kaftrio to include the 
treatment of adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have at 
least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
This application is based on the results of study VX18-445-106, a phase 3, open-label, multicentre 
study in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, with F/MF and F/F genotypes. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Packaged Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
EMA/714293/2021  
Page 85/86 
 
  
 
 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template. RMP 
version 13.0 is acceptable.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0163/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Kaftrio, Symkevi, TOBI 
Podhaler and Bronchitol within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.   
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

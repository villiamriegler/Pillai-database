1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Extension of indication to include treatment of 
patients below 2 months of age based on interim 
results from study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH). The 
pivotal study RAINBOWFISH is an ongoing phase II 
multicentre, open-label, and single-arm study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and PK/PD of risdiplam in pre-symptomatic infants 
below 2 months of age who were genetically 
diagnosed with SMA. As a consequence, SmPC 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been 
updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make some editorial improvements in 
the product information. A revised RMP version 1.1 
was also submitted as part of the application.

SMA gene therapy” and to update the safety profile 
and efficacy data in patients previously treated with 
other SMA-modifying therapies based on the 24-
month primary analysis data from study BP39054 
(JEWELFISH); this is a multicenter, open-label study 
to investigate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in 
adult and paediatric patients with SMA. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor 
editorial changes to the PI.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Striascan is indicated for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum: 
• 
• 
In adult patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndromes, for example those with early 
symptoms, in order to help differentiate essential tremor from parkinsonian syndromes related to 
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
Striascan is unable to discriminate between Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and 
progressive supranuclear palsy. 
In adult patients, to help differentiate probable dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer’s 
d i s e a s e .  Striascan is unable to discriminate between dementia with Lewy bodies and 
Parkinson’s disease dementia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Striascan should only be used in adult patients referred by physicians experienced in the management of 
movement disorders and/or dementia.  
This medical product is for use in hospitals or in designated nuclear medicine facilities only.

Posology 
Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated across the range 110 to 185 MBq. Do not exceed 185 MBq and 
do not use when the activity is below 110 MBq. 
Patients must undergo appropriate thyroid blocking treatment prior to injection to minimise thyroid 
uptake of radioactive iodine, for example by oral administration of approximately 120 mg potassium 
iodide 1 to 4 hours prior to injection of Striascan.  
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. No data 
are available (see section 4.4).  
Careful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation exposure 
is possible in these patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Striascan in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years has not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Striascan is for intravenous use. 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product  
Striascan should be used without dilution. To minimise the potential for pain at the injection site during 
administration, a slow intravenous injection (not less than 15 to 20 seconds) via an arm vein is 
recommended. 
Image acquisition 
SPECT imaging should take place between three and six hours post-injection.  
Images should be acquired using a gamma camera fitted with a high-resolution collimator and calibrated 
using the 159 keV photopeak and a ± 10% energy window. Angular sampling should preferably be not 
less than 120 views over 360 degrees.  
For high resolution collimators the radius of rotation should be consistent and set as small as possible 
(typically 11-15 cm). Experimental studies with a striatal phantom, suggest that optimal images are 
obtained with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of 3.5-4.5 mm for those systems 
currently in use. A minimum of 500 k counts should be collected for optimal images. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Potential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions 
If hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be 
discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate action in 
emergencies, the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube and ventilator 
must be immediately available. 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered 
should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required diagnostic information. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment / Hepatic impairment 
Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. In the 
absence of data, Striascan is not recommended in cases of moderate to severe renal or hepatic 
impairment. 
Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible. 
Patient preparation  
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void as often as 
possible during the first hours after the examination in order to reduce radiation. 
Interpretation of Striascan Images 
Striascan images are interpreted visually, based upon the appearance of the striata.  
Optimum presentation of the reconstructed images for visual interpretation is transaxial slices parallel to 
the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. Determination of whether an image is 
normal or abnormal is made by assessing the extent (as indicated by shape) and intensity (in relation to 
the background) of the striatal signal. 
Normal images are characterised by two symmetrical crescent-shaped areas of equal intensity. Abnormal 
images are either asymmetric or symmetric with unequal or reduced intensity and/or loss of crescent. 
As an adjunct, visual interpretation may be assisted by semi-quantitative assessment using CE-marked 
software, where Striascan uptake in the striatum is compared with uptake in a reference region and ratios 
are compared against an age adjusted healthy subjects’ database. The evaluation of ratios, such as the 
left/right striatum Striascan uptake (symmetry) or caudate/putamen uptake, may further help with the 
image assessment. 
The following precautions should be taken when using semi-quantitative methods: 
•  Semi-quantification should only be used an adjunct to visual assessment 
•  Only CE marked software should be used  
•  Users should be trained in the use of CE marked software by the manufacturer and follow EANM 
practice guidelines for image acquisition, reconstruction and assessment 
•  Readers should interpret the scan visually and then perform the semi-quantitative analysis 
according to manufacturer’s instructions including quality checks for the quantitation process 
o  ROI /VOI techniques should be used to compare uptake in the striatum with uptake in a 
reference region 
o  Comparison against an age adjusted healthy subjects database is recommended to account 
for age-expected decrease in striatal binding 
o  The reconstruction and filter settings (including attenuation correction) used can affect 
the semi-quantitative values. The reconstruction and filter settings recommended by the 
manufacturer of the CE marked software should be followed and should match those 
used for semi-quantification of the healthy subjects database. 
o  The intensity of the striatal signal as measured by SBR (striatal binding ratio) and 
asymmetry and caudate to putamen ratio provide objective numerical values 
corresponding to the visual assessment parameters and can be helpful in difficult to read 
cases 
If the semi-quantitative values are inconsistent with the visual interpretation, the scan 
should be evaluated for appropriate placement of the ROIs /VOIs, correct image 
orientation and appropriate parameters for image acquisition and attenuation correction 
should be verified. Some software packages can support these processes to reduce 
operator-dependent variability 
o 
o  Final assessment should always consider both visual appearance and semi-quantitative 
results

Precautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed in humans. 
Ioflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Active substances that bind to the dopamine transporter with 
high affinity may therefore interfere with Striascan diagnosis. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
amfetamine, 
benzatropine,  
bupropion,  
cocaine,  
mazindol,  
methylphenidate,  
phentermine and  
sertraline. 
Active substances shown during clinical trials not to interfere with Striascan imaging include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
amantadine,  
trihexyphenidyl,  
budipine,  
levodopa,  
metoprolol,  
primidone,  
propranolol and  
selegiline.  
Dopamine agonists and antagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expected to 
interfere with Striascan imaging and can therefore be continued if desired. Medicinal products shown in 
animal studies not to interfere with Striascan imaging include pergolide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is 
important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be 
assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise.  
If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very 
irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to 
the patient. 
Pregnancy 
Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with this product.  
Radionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. 
Administration of 185 MBq of ioflupane (123I) results in an absorbed dose to the uterus of 2.6 mGy. 
Striascan is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breastfeeding 
It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is excreted in human milk. Before administering 
radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to the possibility 
of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breastfeeding, and to what is 
the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity in breast 
milk. 
If administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be interrupted for 3 days and substituted 
by formula feeding. During this time, breast milk should be expressed at regular intervals and the 
expressed feeds should be discarded. 
Fertility 
No fertility studies have been performed. No data are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Striascan has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Uncommon 
Not known  
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. As the effective dose is 4.6 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 185 MBq 
is administered these adverse events are expected to occur with a low probability. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose, frequent micturition and defaecation should be 
encouraged in order to minimise radiation dose to the patient. Care should be taken to avoid 
contamination from the radioactivity eliminated by the patient using such methods.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceutical central nervous system, 
ATC code: V09AB03. 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, Striascan does not appear to have any 
pharmacodynamic activity.

Mechanism of action 
Ioflupane is a cocaine analogue. Studies in animals have shown that ioflupane binds with high affinity to 
the presynaptic dopamine transporter and so radiolabelled ioflupane (123I) can be used as a surrogate 
marker to examine the integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Ioflupane also binds to the 
serotonin transporter on 5-HT neurons but with lower (approximately 10-fold) binding affinity. 
There is no experience in types of tremor other than essential tremor. 
Clinical efficacy 
Clinical studies in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. 
In a clinical trial including evaluation of 288 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
(144 subjects), Alzheimer’s disease (124 subjects), vascular dementia (9 subjects) or other (11 subjects), 
the results of an independent, blinded visual assessment of the ioflupane (123I) images were compared to 
the clinical diagnosis as determined by physicians experienced in the management and diagnosis of 
dementias. Clinical categorisation into the respective dementia group was based on a standardised and 
comprehensive clinical and neuropsychiatric evaluation. The values for the sensitivity of ioflupane (123I) 
in determining probable DLB from non-DLB ranged from 75.0% to 80.2% and specificity from 88.6% to 
91.4%. The positive predictive value ranged from 78.9% to 84.4% and the negative predictive value from 
86.1% to 88.7%. Analyses in which both possible and probable DLB patients were compared with non-
DLB dementia patients demonstrated values for the sensitivity of ioflupane (123I) ranging from 75.0% to 
80.2% and specificity from 81.3% to 83.9% when the possible DLB patients were included as non-DLB 
patients. The sensitivity ranged from 60.6% to 63.4% and specificity from 88.6% to 91.4% when the 
possible DLB patients were included as DLB patients. 
Clinical studies demonstrating adjunctive use of semi-quantitative information for image interpretation 
The reliability of using semi-quantitative information as an adjunct to visual inspection was analysed in 
four clinical studies where sensitivity, specificity or overall accuracy between the two methods of image 
interpretation were compared. In the four studies (total n=578), CE-marked DaTSCAN semi-quantitation 
software was used. The differences (i.e., improvements when adding semi-quantitative information to 
visual inspection) in sensitivity ranged between 0.1% and 5.5%, in specificity between 0.0% and 2.0%, 
and in overall accuracy between 0.0% and 12.0%. 
The biggest of these four studies retrospectively assessed a total of 304 DaTSCAN exams from 
previously conducted Phase 3 or 4 studies, which included subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PS, non-
PS (mainly ET), probable DLB, and non-DLB (mainly AD). Five nuclear medicine physicians who had 
limited prior experience with DaTSCAN interpretation assessed the images in 2 readings (alone and 
combined with semi-quantitative data provided by DaTQUANT 4.0 software) at least 1 month apart.  
These results were compared with the subject’s 1-to 3-year follow-up diagnosis to determine diagnostic 
accuracy. The improvements in sensitivity and specificity [with 95% confidence intervals] were  
0.1% [-6.2%,6.4%] and 2.0% [-3.0%,7.0%]. Also, the results of the combined reading were associated 
with an increase in reader confidence. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Ioflupane (123I) is cleared rapidly from the blood after intravenous injection; only 5% of the administered 
activity remains in whole blood at 5 minutes post-injection. 
Organ uptake 
Uptake in the brain is rapid, reaching about 7% of injected activity at 10 minutes post-injection and 
decreasing to 3% after 5 hours. About 30% of the whole brain activity is attributed to striatal uptake. 
Elimination 
At 48 hours post-injection, approximately 60% of the injected radioactivity is excreted in the urine, with 
faecal excretion calculated at approximately 14%. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data for ioflupane reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Studies on reproductive toxicity and to assess the carcinogenic potential of ioflupane have not been 
performed. 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
After use, all materials associated with the preparation and administration of radiopharmaceuticals, 
including any unused product and its container, should be decontaminated or treated as radioactive waste 
and disposed of in accordance with the conditions specified by the local competent authority. 
Contaminated material must be disposed of as radioactive waste via an authorised route.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
General warning 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations 
and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
If at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of this vial is compromised it should not be 
used. 
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. 
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

11.  DOSIMETRY 
The biokinetic model for ioflupane (123I) adopted by ICRP 128 ((International Commission on 
Radiological Protection ,2015) assumes initial uptake of 31% of the administered activity in the liver, 
11% in the lungs, and 4% in the brain. The rest is assumed to be distributed uniformly in the remaining 
organs and tissues. For all organs and tissues, 80% is assumed to be excreted with a biological half-time 
of 58 h, and 20% with a half-time of 1.6 h. It is further assumed that 60% of the injected activity is 
excreted to the urine, and 40% is excreted to the gastrointestinal tract for all organs and tissues. Activity 
in the liver is excreted according to the Publication 53 gallbladder model (ICRP, 1987), where 30% is 
eliminated via the gallbladder and the remainder passes directly into the small intestine.  
The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average adult patient (70 kg) from intravenous injection of 
ioflupane (123I) are listed below according to ICRP 128.

The effective dose (E) resulting from administration of 185 MBq of Striascan injection is 4.6 mSv (per 
70 kg individual). The above data are valid in normal pharmacokinetic behaviour. When renal or hepatic 
function is impaired, the effective dose and the radiation dose delivered to organs might be increased. 
For an administered activity of 185 MBq the typical radiation dose to the target organ (brain) is 3 mGy 
and the typical radiation doses to the critical organs: liver and colon wall are 16 mGy and 11 mGy, 
respectively.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Striascan is and what it is used for 
This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only.  
Striascan contains the active substance ioflupane (123I) which is used to help identify (diagnose) conditions 
in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called “radiopharmaceuticals”, which contain a small 
amount of radioactivity. 
•  When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a 
• 
• 
short time. 
Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using 
special cameras. 
A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is 
inside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ 
is working. 
Striascan is used only to identify illness. When this medicine is injected into a patient, it is carried around 
the body in the blood and collects in a small area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in: 
• 
• 
parkinsonism (including Parkinson’s disease) and 
dementia with Lewy bodies. 
A scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may 
feel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible treatment. 
When Striascan is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than in 
some types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the 
clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to 
these small amounts of radiation. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before Striascan is used 
Striascan must not be used 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to ioflupane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are pregnant. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using this medicine if you have moderate or severe 
problems with your kidneys or liver. 
Before administration of Striascan you should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination 
in order to urinate as often as possible during the first hours after the study.   
Children and adolescents 
Striascan is not recommended for children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years. 
Other medicines and Striascan 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. 
Some medicines or substances can affect the way that this medicine works. 
These include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
bupropion (used to treat depression (sadness)) 
benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson’s disease) 
mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity) 
sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)) 
methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness)) 
phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity) 
amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); also a 
drug of abuse) 
cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a drug of abuse) 
Some medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking 
them for a short time before you receive Striascan. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Striascan if there is a 
possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.  
When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. 
If you are pregnant, do not use Striascan. This is because the child may receive some of the 
radioactivity.  Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity should be considered. 
If you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of this product or ask you to 
stop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) you are given is passed into breast milk. 
• 
• 
You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after this product is given. 
Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any 
breast milk you have expressed. 
You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your body. 
• 
Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Striascan will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Striascan contains alcohol (ethanol): up to 197 mg of alcohol in each dose which is equivalent to 39.5 
mg/mL (5% by volume). The amount in 5 mL of this medicine is equivalent to 5 mL beer or 2 mL wine. 
The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. How Striascan is used 
There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity. Striascan will always be used in a 
hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and 
qualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of this medicine. 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Striascan to be used 
in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.  
The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 110 to 185 MBq 
(megabecquerel or MBq, the unit used to measure radioactivity). 
Administration of Striascan and conduct of the procedure 
Before you receive Striascan, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid that 
contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that you take 
the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. 
Striascan is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. A single injection is enough.  
Duration of the procedure  
The camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours after the injection of this product. Your nuclear 
medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. 
After administration of Striascan, you should urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from 
your body.  
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving 
this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. 
If you are given more Striascan than you should 
Since this product is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an 
overdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get 
rid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell 
you what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like Striascan. Any ioflupane (123I) which remains 
in your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who 
supervises the procedure.

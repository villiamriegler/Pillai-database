literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a 
close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or 
re-challenge, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal 
relationship between somatropin and acute pancreatitis is at 
least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur 
concludes that Section 4.4 of the SmPC of products 
containing somatropin should be amended to add a warning 
on pancreatitis. 
Additionally, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal 
relationship between somatropin and gynecomastia is 
established and concludes that section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
products containing somatropin should be amended, to add 
the adverse reaction gynecomastia with a frequency 
uncommon.  
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.

On 10 December 2010, the European Commission 
initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 for somatropin-containing 
medicinal products authorised in the centralised 
procedure and requested the CHMP to assess all the 
available data and its impact on the risk benefit 
balance for somatropin-containing medicinal products 
and to give its opinion on measures necessary to 
ensure the safe and effective use of these medicinal 
products and whether the marketing authorisations 
for these products should be maintained, varied,

suspended or revoked. 
The scope of the review was to assess the long-term 
safety of growth hormone treatments in light of the 
emerging safety data from the French SAGHE study in 
particular with regards the potential increased risk of 
mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system, 
bone tumours and subarachnoid or intracerebral 
haemorrhage in children and when high doses are 
used.

the relationship between reported cases of aseptic necrosis 
and therapy with growth hormone, since these events are 
very rare (< 0,01 %), and since this complication is more 
prevalent in children with chronic renal failure and growth 
hormone deficiency even without therapy. Nevertheless, the 
CHMP considered relevant to include the following warning in 
the SPC: 
''Patients with growth hormone failure secondary to CRI 
should be examined periodically for evidence of progression 
of renal osteodystrophy. Slipped capital femoral epiphyses 
and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head may be seen in 
children with advanced renal osteodystrophy and in growth 
hormone deficiency, and it is uncertain whether these 
problems are affected by GH therapy. Physicians and parents 
should be alert to the development of a limp or complaints of 
hip or knee pain in patients treated with somatropin".

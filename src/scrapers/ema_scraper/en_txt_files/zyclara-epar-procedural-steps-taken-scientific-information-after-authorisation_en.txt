1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

One additional 2-week treatment of Zyclara may be 
order to add information from study X-03016-3284 
(LEIDA 2) and from a meta-analysis of studies X-
03016-3271 and X-03016-3284, two open-label 
randomized, controlled studies investigating the 
long-term effects of imiquimod 5% (and not with this

(3% gel). The MAH took the opportunity to update 
the details of local representatives in the PL.

generic/hybrid/biosimilar products following 
assessment of the same change for the reference 
considered in case lesions do not respond completely to 
treatment at 8 weeks after the second treatment cycle.  
A different therapy is recommended if the treated lesions 
show insufficient response to Zyclara. Also, that actinic 
keratosis (AK) lesions that have cleared after two Zyclara 
treatment cycles of 2 weeks and subsequently recur can be 
re-treated with one or two further Zyclara treatment cycles 
of 2 weeks following an at least 12 weeks treatment pause. 
Two open-label randomized, controlled studies investigated 
the long-term effects of imiquimod 5% (and not with this 
3.75% product) in comparison to topical diclofenac (3% 
gel). These studies showed that imiquimod was better than

topical diclofenac in preventing the histological progression 
of AK lesions to in-situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC). In addition, these studies supported the use of up to 
two additional treatment cycles of imiquimod when the AK 
lesions are not completely cleared or if the AK lesions 
recurred after successful initial treatment with imiquimod.

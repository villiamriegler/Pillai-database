1.  Introduction
On 25 May 2022, the MAH submitted the completed EP00-502 Adult study for Omnitrope, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The study included at least 
one paediatric patient(s) due to a protocol deviation. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure MEA 039. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Information on the development program
The MAH stated that study EP00-502 is a standalone study.

2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The active substance of Omnitrope is somatropin, a recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 
produced by a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli. Omnitrope is a biological medicinal 
product first authorized in the EU under the Biosimilar regulatory pathway. Studies have shown 
Omnitrope to have a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile to the reference medicinal product, 
Genotropin. 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:
The post-marketing surveillance (PMS), termed Patients Treated with Omnitrope (PATRO), was part of 
MAH’s post-authorization commitment in the EU. Omnitrope (somatropin) has a marketing 
authorisation since 12-04-2006 and is used to treat paediatric and adult patients with growth hormone 
deficiency (GHD).
PATRO consists of two studies, the study EP00-501 in paediatric patients and the study EP00-502 in 
adult patients. The CHMP reclassified this post-authorization commitment in 2012 as a category 3 
PASS.
The final CSR of study EP00-501 has been assessed in a separate art. 46 procedure in 2020 
(EMEA/H/C/000607/MEA). 
Study EP00-502 is an international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open, multi-center 
post-marketing surveillance, designed to record the safety and effectiveness of adult patients treated 
with Omnitrope within routine clinical practice. Patient enrolment began in Sep-2007 and 1500 patients 
were planned to be enrolled. Due to a protocol deviation, several patients were enrolled in this study 
who were under the age of 18. Submission of the study results of these paediatric patients within an 
art. 46 procedure was therefore deemed necessary by EMA. 
In this assessment report, the data of these paediatric patients will be discussed. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study EP00-502 
Description
Methods
This study was an international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open, multi-center 
PMS, designed to record the safety and effectiveness data of adult patients treated with Omnitrope 
within routine clinical practice. 
Study participants
Adult patients treated with Omnitrope within routine clinical practice.
Treatments
Omnitrope (powder and solvent for solution for injection and/or solution for injection) was 
administered subcutaneously using the appropriate medical device for Omnitrope according to the 
marketing authorization in the respective countries. 
Objective(s)
Primary objective - to collect and analyse the long-term safety of Omnitrope in adults treated within 
routine clinical practice. Particular emphasis is laid on the following aspects:

Risks of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus.
 Occurrence of malignancies.
Secondary objective - to monitor the treated population and to collect data on the effectiveness of 
Omnitrope treatment, as follows:




Evaluation of IGF-1 levels.
Evaluation of parameters of lipid spectrum as surrogate for cardiovascular risk factors.
Evaluation of body composition (BMI, waist/hip circumference ratio, and decrease of total fat 
mass).
Characteristics of Omnitrope treatment such as posology in adults.
 Description and outcome of QoL questionnaires, if applicable.
Outcomes/endpoints
See objectives. 
Sample size
1500 patients were planned to be enrolled over five years in Europe (aiming for overall 7500 patient-
years of data).
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
This was an observational study, no randomisation and blinding was conducted. 
Statistical Methods
Statistical tests were not performed and consequently p-values to indicate statistical significant 
differences were not provided.
Descriptive analysis of all available parameters are performed displaying the following: 
• Continuous parameters (e.g. age, height, weight): n, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 
maximum, median, number of missing values, 1st and 3rd quartiles. 
• Categorical parameters (e.g. sex): frequency and percentage in each category, number of missing 
values. 
Results
Participant flow
Among the patients who were documented in the NIS EP00-502 PATRO Adults, 5 patients started 
growth hormone (GH) treatment as adolescents (16-17 years of age).

Recruitment
Two patients were enrolled in France, two in the UK and one in Spain. 
Baseline data
All 5 patients (2 male and 3 female) had childhood onset of GHD; 1 patient with isolated GHD was GH 
treatment naïve, and 4 patients with additional hormone deficiencies were GH-pretreated. The females 
received concomitant oestrogen/progesterone treatment.

Number analysed
Descriptive data from all 5 paediatric patients is provided. 
Efficacy results
The median Omnitrope treatment duration was 7.10 years (range 1.5 to 12.6 years).

treatment (SAF)
IGF-1
After 1.5 years, the median (IQR) IGF-1 SDS peaked in most of the patients. Between baseline and 5 
years visit, the median IGF-1 SDS was between -2.04 and -0.82 in naïve patients and between -0.52 
and -0.17 in pre-treated patients.

treated/naive) (EFF)
Safety results
None of the 5 pediatric patients was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus by the investigator nor had any 
laboratory findings indicative for meeting the WHO (2016) diabetes mellitus criteria which is defined as 
FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L during OGTT or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. None of the 5 
paediatric patients had a pre-existing Diabetes Mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance as concurrent 
disease.
None of the 5 pediatric patients was diagnosed with a new malignancy or a re-occurrence of a 
preexisting malignancy. 
Overall, 19 adverse events (AEs) were reported in those 5 patients of which one was serious (see 
SAE). No AE or severe adverse event (SAE) had a suspected causal relationship to Omnitrope 
treatment.
One SAE with moderate intensity occurred (verbatim: decompensation of pituitary insufficiency), and 
the event completely resolved. Causality with Omnitrope treatment was not suspected. 
One AE led to reduction of the Omnitrope dose (mild hypertension, which completely resolved).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
Within this P46 procedure, the MAH has submitted data from 5 paediatric patients who were included 
as protocol deviation in adult PASS study EP00-502 and were treated with Omnitrope. 
In line with the paediatric study EP00-501, the primary objectives were to further characterize the 
safety of long-term Omnitrope treatment, especially with respect to risks of glucose intolerance or 
diabetes mellitus and the occurrence of malignancies. IGF-1 levels were measured as effectiveness 
parameter. No growth velocity and final height was collected per protocol as this was designed as an 
adult study. 
The 5 paediatric patients included were 16-17 years of age at the start of treatment. Four of the 
patients were pre-treated with GH. The median Omnitrope treatment duration was 7.10 years (range 
1.5 to 12.6 years). 
Given the small number of paediatric patients in this study, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn. 
Nevertheless, the data is in concurrence with the data from 7359 paediatric patients in study EP00-
501. 
No safety issues were identified with respect to the occurrence of malignancies and the development of 
glucose intolerance and diabetes. 
The observed AEs were mild to moderate, resolved and were not judged as related to study treatment. 
This conclusion can be agreed. 
IGF-1 levels were in general within -2 to +2 SDS starting from baseline, which is expected as 4 out of 
5 patients were pre-treated with GH. 
Overall, the final study data support safety and efficacy of Omnitrope throughout the range of 
indications in paediatric patients < 18 years of age. No further action with regard to the SmPC is 
considered necessary.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation
The data from 5 paediatric patients is in line with the 7359 paediatric patients in study EP00-501. The 
safety and effectiveness data as presented in the subset of paediatric patients are in general as 
expected and do not give rise to any concerns with regard to long term safety or the effectiveness of 
the product.
P46 considered fulfilled. No regulatory action required.

1.  Introduction 
On 3rd July 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (GENA-40) for Nuwiq/Vihuma, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. At that time, only a sum-
mary study report was provided in order to meet the submission deadline of 6 months after study 
completion. Since the final study report was expected for October 2020, it was decided to await the full 
final study report prior to scientific review. As a consequence and in accordance with the EMA submis-
sion requirements for Article 46 paediatric studies, the following issues were raised (RSI sent 11 Au-
gust 2020): 
1.  The final clinical study report of GENA-40 has to be submitted (announced for October 2020). 
2.  A critical clinical overview has to be submitted 
In response, the MAH submitted the full study report of GENA-40 on 02 October 2020. Concerning the 
requested critical clinical overview document, the MAH referred to the Critical Expert Overview submit-
ted together with the final clinical study report of GENA-05 (submitted according to Art. 46 of Regula-
tion (EC) No 1901/2006 on 24 September 2020) combining the information on both studies (GENA-05 
and GENA-40) in one report. 
As stated in the original Cover Letter, dated 03 July 2020, no amendments to be introduced to the 
Product Information, and thus no regulatory consequences, have been identified by the MAH. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Human-cl rhFVIII (simoctocog alfa), currently marketed as Nuwiq and its duplicate Vihuma was ap-
proved in Europe in July 2014 for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemo-
philia A in all age groups. 
The study concerned by this article 46 procedure (GENA-40) has been conducted as part of the clinical 
development program of Human-cl rhFVIII, with the rationale of subsequently applying for the approv-
al of Human-cl rhFVIII in China. A line listing of all non-clinical and clinical studies which are part of the 
development programme of Human-cl rhFVIII is annexed to this report. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Human-cl rhFVIII (simoctocog alfa) is a B domain-deleted recombinant human blood coagulation factor 
VIII (rhFVIII) concentrate for intravenous use. The protein is expressed in a human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) cell line derivative (HEK293F) adapted to grow in serum-free culture medium. Human-cl rhFVIII 
is supplied as lyophilised powder with nominal potencies of 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 IU per 
vial, to be reconstituted with 2.5 mL of water for injection.

GENA-40: Prospective clinical study to investigate the clinical efficacy, immunogenicity, phar-
macokinetics and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in Chinese patients with severe haemophilia A 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
GENA-40: Prospective clinical study to investigate the clinical efficacy, immunogenicity, pharmacoki-
netics and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in Chinese patients with severe haemophilia A 
Description 
GENA-40 was a prospective, non-controlled, open-label, multinational, multicentre Phase 3b study of 
63 PTPs (≥6 years) with severe haemophilia A with at least 150 previous EDs to FVIII concentrates. 
The study was conducted exclusively in Chinese patients, both children and adults. GENA-40 included 
24 children between 6 and 12 years of age and 15 adolescents. Patients received treatment with Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII for a period of 6 months. The study was initiated in June 2018 and completed in Janu-
ary 2020.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary: 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the pre-
vention and treatment of bleeding episodes (BEs). 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Human-cl rhFVIII by measurement of the ar-
ea under the curve (AUC), half-life (T1/2), incremental in-vivo recovery (IVR), maximum plas-
ma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribu-
tion at steady state (Vss) and clearance (CL); 
To determine the IVR of Human-cl rhFVIII – at study start and over time; 
To investigate the immunogenic potential of Human-cl rhFVIII by assessing inhibitor titre; 
To assess the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII as surgical prophylaxis; 
To assess the safety of Human-cl rhFVIII by monitoring adverse events (AEs). 
Study design 
GENA-40 was a prospective, non-controlled, open-label, multinational, multicentre Phase 3b study, 
planned to be performed in 60 evaluable male Chinese PTPs (≥6 years) with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII:C <1%). Around 12 centres in China were planned to participate in this study. The study com-
prised a PK assessment of Human-cl rhFVIII  in a subgroup of 20 patients (restricted to patients ≥12 
years) and a 6-Month treatment period with Human-cl rhFVIII. For the evaluation of PK, patients re-
ceived a single dose of Human-cl rhFVIII (50±5 IU FVIII/kg). During the 6-Month treatment period,

patients were treated with Human-cl rhFVIII either prophylactically or on demand. The main focus of 
the study was the investigation of the clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the prevention and treat-
ment of BEs. In addition, PK parameters, IVR over time, immunogenicity and safety were assessed. If 
patients underwent surgery during the study, the efficacy of surgical prophylaxis was documented. 
Study population /Sample size 
GENA-40 was conducted exclusively in Chinese patients, both children and adults. The study was open 
to male Chinese patients ≥6 years of age with severe haemophilia A who were previously treated with 
FVIII concentrate for at least 150 exposure days (EDs). The study was planned to enroll approximately 
70 patients (60 evaluable patients), 20 of whom were to undergo an initial PK assessment (PK sub-
group). Sample size was chosen based on publications from other haemophilia A studies conducted in 
China for licensure of rFVIII products. 
Treatments 
For the 6-Month Treatment Period, prophylactic treatment was recommended, but it was ultimately the 
decision of the responsible treating physician whether patients were treated prophylactically or on de-
mand. 
Prophylactic Treatment: 
Patients were to receive 30–40 IU FVIII/kg BW of Human-cl rhFVIII every-other-day or three-times-
weekly for 6 months. Two dose escalations of +5 IU FVIII/kg BW each were to be implemented in case 
of an inadequate response (>2 spontaneous BEs within one month). In cases of inadequate response, 
Human-cl rhFVIII administration frequency or dose adjustments were to be considered at the Investi-
gator’s discretion. 
On-Demand Treatment: 
Patients could receive Human-cl rhFVIII for the treatment of breakthrough BEs during prophylaxis or 
as on-demand only treatment. The dosage and duration of treatment of spontaneous or traumatic BEs 
depended on the location and the extent of the BE as well as on the clinical situation of the patient. 
Dosage recommendations were provided as follows: 
•  Minor BEs: 20–30 IU FVIII/kg BW every 12–24 hours until BE is resolved; 
•  Moderate to major BEs: 30–40 IU FVIII/kg BW. Repeat dose every 12–24 hours until BE is re-
solved; 
•  Major to life threatening BEs: Initial dose of 50–60 IU FVIII/kg BW. Repeat dose of 20–25 IU 
FVIII/kg BW every 8–12 hours until BE is resolved. 
Surgical Prophylaxis: 
The dosage and duration of treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII depended on the type of surgery. Dosage 
recommendations were provided as follows: 
•  Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25–30 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to sur-
gery to achieve an intended target peak level of approximately 50–60%. Repeat one dose at 
12–24 hours if needed. Trough level should be maintained at approximately 30%; 
•  Major surgeries: 50 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended tar-
get peak level of approximately 100%. Repeat if necessary after 6–12 hours initially and for ≥6 
days until healing is complete. Trough level should be maintained at approximately 50%.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary:  
• 
Efficacy: The clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the prevention and treatment of BEs was 
assessed during the 6-Month treatment period. The efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in prophylac-
tic treatment was evaluated as excellent, good, moderate, or poor based on the frequency of 
spontaneous BEs per month. The analysis of Human-cl rhFVIII in prophylactic treatment was 
further analysed based on the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for spontaneous breakthrough 
bleeds; this was not planned in the protocol but was added in the statistical analysis plan. 
The efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the treatment of BEs (breakthrough BEs during prophylaxis 
and BEs during on-demand treatment) was assessed on a 4-point scale as excellent, good, 
moderate or none. Details of the BE (type, site and severity of the BE, and the start and end 
date and time of the BE), the amount of Human-cl rhFVIII needed and the number of injections 
necessary to stop the BE were documented. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
PK Parameters: A full PK analysis using a non-compartmental model was performed with Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII (50±5 IU FVIII/kg BW) in the PK subgroup at study start. The following PK pa-
rameters were assessed: AUC, T1/2, IVR, Cmax, Tmax, MRT, Vss and CL. PK parameters for Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII were calculated using the labelled and actual potency and actual sampling time 
points. FVIII:C was measured with the one-stage assay at the central laboratory in China. 
IVR: IVR investigations for Human-cl rhFVIII (50±5 IU FVIII/kg BW) were conducted at study 
start and after 3 and 6 months of treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII. Sampling time points were 
at baseline (prior to infusion) and at 30 minutes and 1 hour (±5 minutes) post infusion. Actual 
time points were documented. IVR for Human-cl rhFVIII was calculated using the labelled and 
actual potency and actual sampling time points. FVIII:C was measured with the one-stage as-
say at the central laboratory in China. IVR over time was analysed. 
Immunogenicity: Inhibitor activity was determined by the modified Bethesda assay (Nijmegen 
modification), using congenital FVIII-deficient human plasma spiked with Human-cl rhFVIII at 
Screening the ED 10–15 visit, the 3 months visit (±2 weeks); and at 6 months / study comple-
tion visit (+2 weeks); and at any time in the case of a suspicion of inhibitor development. In 
case of a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor re-test of a second separately drawn sample was 
to be performed. Samples were analysed at the central laboratory in China. 
•  Surgery: Efficacy was assessed at the end of surgery by the surgeon and post-operatively by 
the haematologist using pre-defined scales. An overall efficacy assessment, taking both the in-
tra- and post-operative assessment into account, was performed jointly by the surgeon and the 
haematologist using an algorithm as guidance. 
•  Safety: Clinical safety was assessed by monitoring AEs throughout the study, and by physical 
examination, vital signs, and safety laboratory parameters at pre-defined time points. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary approach to the statistical analysis was descriptive, presenting summary tables for the 
measured and derived variables. No inferential analysis involving formal testing was planned in this 
non-controlled trial.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 63 Chinese patients, all previously treated patients (PTPs), were enrolled and treated with 
Human-cl rhFVIII at 11 investigational centres in China. 62 patients completed the study. One patient 
discontinued prematurely due to low compliance. All 63 enrolled patients were treated prophylactically 
and included into the SAF, ITT, and PROPH populations. No patients were treated only on-demand.  
Baseline data 
Age at screening ranged from 6 to 51 years, with a median of 15 years. All patients were Asian. The 
study population included 24 children between 6 and 12 years of age (median: 8 years, range: 6-11 
years) and 15 adolescents (median: 15 years, range: 12-17 years). In the group of 6 - <12 years and 
12 - <18 years, median HJHS at screening was 4 (range, 0-28) and 6 (range, 0-27), respectively. 
Efficacy results 
PK evaluation: 
PK was assessed in a subgroup of 20 patients ≥12 years of age. Of these, 7 patients were aged 12 - 
<18 years and 13 were aged ≥18 years. The concentration-time profile was consistent with the well-
characterized profile for Human-cl rhFVIII in previous studies: mean concentrations were increased at 
30 minutes post-injection and remained elevated compared with baseline values at 60 minutes post-
injection, although a slight decrease in mean concentrations was observed between 30 and 60 minutes 
due to elimination of the infused FVIII, and by 48 hours post-injection, concentrations had decreased 
to levels slightly above pre-injection levels. The concentration-time profiles reflected slightly lower re-
covery for patients aged 12 - <18 years compared to patients ≥18 years. Summary statistics for the 
PK parameters of Human-cl rhFVIII, using calculations based on the actual relative dose, are provided 
for the one stage assay in Table 1 below. The observed mean (±SD) half-life of 10.2 ± 1.3 hours was 
at the lower end compared to that reported in other studies with Human-cl rhFVIII (e.g. 17.1±11.2 in 
GENA-01, 12.5±4.2 in GENA-03 and 11.4±3.9 in GENA-09) and, correspondingly, the observed mean 
(±SD) AUCnorm of 0.18 ± 1.4 h·IU/mL/[IU/kg] was lower than that reported in other studies with Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII (e.g. 0.37±0.11 in GENA-01, 0.24±0.08 in GENA-03 and 0.29±0.13 in GENA-09). PK 
parameters were broadly comparable between the adolescent and adult age groups, with slightly high-
er Cmax and AUCnorm observed in the adult age group.

A total of 63 patients were included in the ITT population and were evaluable for IVR assessment. Re-
sults of the IVR analyses are summarized in Table 2 below. Mean IVR values were consistently 
1.8%/IU/kg at ED1, 3 months and 6 months. The mean IVR values were slightly lower for the 6 - <12 
years and 12 - <18 years age groups, but were >1.6%/IU/kg at each time point.

Prophylactic treatment: 
In GENA-40, all patients received prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII. The planned dosing 
regimen was three-times-weekly in 55 (87.3%) patients and every-other-day in 8 (12.7%) patients. 
The mean duration of prophylactic treatment was 6.1 months, ranging from 4 to 6.5 months. The 
mean dose (±SD) per kg per ED for prophylaxis was 35.0 ± 2.7 IU/kg/ED (median: 35.1 IU/kg; range, 
29–40). There were no relevant differences between the age groups. The mean (±SD) monthly doses 
of Human-cl rhFVIII were 426.7 ± 52.1 IU/kg in 6 - <12 year old children, 422.0 ± 43.4 IU/kg in ado-
lescents, and 449.1 ± 43.4 IU/kg in adults.  
Under prophylaxis, 77.7% of the patients ihad 0 to 3 BEs under prophylaxis including 19 patients with-
out any BE during treatment. The monthly rate of spontaneous break-through bleeds (MBR) during 
time of prophylactic treatment was assessed as excellent, good, moderate or poor. The efficacy of 
prophylactic treatment was excellent (MBR <0.75) in 60 patients (95.2%), good (MBR 0.75–1) in 1 
(1.6%) patient, and poor (MBR >1.5) in 2 (3.2%) patients. The patients with efficacy rated as ‘poor’ 
were two adolescents, of whom one discontinued prematurely due to low compliance (MBR of 4.31) 
and the other did not receive treatment according to protocol (MBR of 1.60). 
The spontaneous, traumatic, and overall annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) in total and by age group 
are summarized in Table 3 below. In the per-protocol population the median ABRs (IQR) for all BEs 
were 1.94 (1.87, 3.90) in 6-<12 year old children (n=20), 2.05 (0.95, 4.88) in adolescents (n=12), 
and 1.89 (0, 5.77) in adults (n=21).

Treatment of bleeding episodes: 
The number of treated treatment-emergent BEs was 173. Of these, 81 (46.8%) were documented as 
spontaneous, 78 (45.1%) as traumatic, 13 (7.5%) as ‘other’, and 1 (0.6%) had missing type. BEs 
where the site was specified were most common in the ankle (53 [30.6%]), knee (23 [13.3%]), and 
elbow (22 [12.7%]). ‘Other’ sites of bleeding were mainly BEs characterized by multiple sites and ac-
counted for 39 (22.5%) BEs. The efficacy assessment of bleeding episodes at end of a BE was evaluat-
ed on an objective 4-point scale by the patient/legal guardian (together with the Investigator in case of 
on-site treatment). The patient/Investigator rated the majority of BEs as having excellent (60.7%) or 
good (19.1%) treatment efficacy, giving a success rate of 79.8%; treatment efficacy was rated as 
moderate for 18.5% of BEs. The sponsor also performed a post-hoc assessment, based on the number 
of infusions needed to stop the bleed and the bleeding duration, re-evaluating BEs that appeared to 
not have been rated in-line with the rating scale and BEs with no rating. More BEs were rated as hav-
ing excellent efficacy by the sponsor as compared to the patient/Investigator (69.4% vs. 60.7%) but 
the overall success rate remained comparable (80.9% vs. 79.8%); 9 (5.2%) BEs were rated by the 
sponsor as having an efficacy assessment of ‘none’ as 5 infusions were administered and duration of 
bleeding episode was ≥72 hours.  
In the group of paediatrics, a total of 31 children (N=19 between 6 and <12 years, N=12 between 12 
to <18 year) experienced a total of 114 BEs (N=61 in the group of 6-<12 year olds, N=53 in the group

of 12-<18 year olds) that were treated with Human-cl rhFVIII. None of these BEs was a major bleeding 
episode. Results of the sponsor’s efficacy assessment for the treatment of BEs by age group are sum-
marized in Table 3 below. 
Table 4:  
Overall efficacy assessment for bleeding episodes 
Source: Table 14.2.2.5-1, CSR 
Most BEs (141 [81.5%]) were resolved with 1 (121 BEs) or 2 (20 BEs) infusions of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
The median number of infusions per BE was 1.0 (IQR: 1.00, 2.00; range: 0-110), and the median dose 
per episode/kg body weight was 35.71 IU/kg (IQR: 31.25, 71.43; range: 22.9-4036.6). The number of 
infusions per BE and the dose per BE/kg body weight were comparable across the age groups (i.e. me-
dian doses per BE were 35.71 IU/kg [IQR: 31.25, 51.47; range: 26.7-4036.6] in 6 - <12 year old chil-
dren and 50.38 IU/kg [IQR: 35.71, 83.33; range: 22.94-520] in the group of adolescents). 
Surgical prophylaxis: 
In GENA-40, a total of 5 patients had 6 surgeries that were included in the SURG population. One of 
these surgeries was minor and 5 were major. Four out of 6 surgeries (all major) had an overall efficacy 
assessment performed jointly by the haematologist and surgeon, all rated as having excellent efficacy. 
These procedures included a major procedure (i.e. release of right gastrocnemius aponeurosis + 
lengthening of right Achilles tendon) performed in a 15 year old boy. This patient received one infusion 
of Human-cl rhFVIII before (40 IU/kg) and 23 infusions (15 EDs with an average dose of 51.33 IU/kg 
per ED) after the procedure (total dose: 2000 + 38500 IU). One minor surgery (tooth extraction in an 
8 year old boy) and 1 major surgery (nasal sinus mass removal in an adult) were not assessed due to 
the procedures having taken place outside of the study site. 
Safety results 
In GENA-40, patients had a mean of 86 days of exposure to Human-cl rhFVIII, received a mean of 91 
infusions and a mean dose per kg BW per ED of 36.5 IU/kg/ED. Dosing and exposure were comparable 
across the age groups. A total of 37 (58.7%) patients experienced 74 treatment-emergent adverse 
events (AEs). Of the 63 patients in the safety population (SAF), 29 (46.0%) experienced only mild AEs, 
7 (11.1%) experienced moderate AEs, and 1 (1.6%) patient experienced a severe AE (pyrexia).

Considering the relatively small sample sizes of the subgroups, there was no clinically relevant differ-
ence in the safety profile observed in children, adolescents, and adults. Most AE preferred terms were 
reported only once. The most commonly reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (12 
[19.0%] patients), nasopharyngitis (7 [11.1%]), cough (4 [6.3%]), and pyrexia (3 [4.8%]). Pyrexia is 
an expected adverse reaction for Human-cl rhFVIII; however, each AE of pyrexia was assessed as not 
related to IMP by the investigator. No safety concerns were raised by clinical laboratory, vital sign, and 
physical examination findings. 
There were no deaths in this study. No patient tested positive for FVIII inhibitors. No patients had AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation from the study and no AEs were assessed as possibly/probably 
related to IMP by the Investigators or the sponsor. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
As part of this Article 46 procedure, the MAH submitted the final study report of GENA-40 together 
with an updated Critical Expert Overview. The aim of this Phase 3b study was to assess the efficacy, 
immunogenicity, PK parameters and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in Asian patients with severe haemo-
philia A with the rationale of subsequently applying for the approval of Human-cl rhFVIII in China. In 
GENA-40, data was collected from a total of 63 previously treated patients, including 39 children (i.e. 
24 children between 6-<12 year of age and 15 adolescents) at 11 investigational centres in China. 
The evaluation of clinical efficacy included assessments of haemostatic efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in 
routine and surgical prophylaxis and in the treatment of bleeding episodes. Treatment recommenda-
tions were comparable to previous trials and generally in line with the posology of Human-cl rhFVIII as 
reflected in the current EU SmPC. Similarly, measurements and assessments employed in GENA-40 
were consistent with previous trials conducted in non-Asian patients. 
Pharmacokinetic evaluation 
In GENA-40, a full PK analysis of Human-cl rhFVIII was performed in a subgroup of 20 patients ≥12 
years of age, including 7 adolescents. In contrast to the recommendations given in the EMA guideline 
on the clinical investigation of Factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009), the duration of 
Factor VIII wash-out was ≥72 hours (instead of at least 4 days), patients were not re-tested after 3-6 
months, and FVIII:C levels were solely measured with the one-stage clotting assay. With regard to the 
latter, it is noted that previous studies with Human-cl rhFVIII did not indicate significant differences 
between the one-stage and chromogenic assays.  
PK parameters obtained for the group of adolescents were broadly comparable to adults, with slightly 
higher Cmax and AUCnorm observed in the adult age group. Compared to previous trials conducted in 
non-Asian patients, results of GENA-40 indicate a trend towards shorter half-life (i.e. 10.2±1.3 hours 
vs. 17.1±11.2 in GENA-01, 12.5±4.2 in GENA-03 and 11.4±3.9 in GENA-09), lower AUCnorm (i.e. 
0.18±1.4 h·IU/mL/[IU/kg] vs. 0.37±0.11 in GENA-01, 0.24±0.08 in GENA-03 and 0.29±0.13 in GENA-
09) and increased clearance. 
In addition to the full PK evaluation, IVR was analysed for all patients at the start and after 3 and 6 
months of treatment. As expected and consistent with other products of this class, IVR values were 
lower in children <12 years of age (i.e. ~1.6%/IU/kg at all time points) compared to adults 
(~2%/IU/kg at all time points). Again, however, values obtained in the Chinese population were con-
sistently lower than the ones obtained in previous trials as specified in section 5.2 of the EU SmPC (i.e. 
1.9%/IU/kg in children aged 6 to 12 years and 2.5%/IU/kg in adults).

While the seeming trend towards lower IVR and overall increased metabolism of Human-cl rhFVIII in 
Chinese patients may be explained by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic differences between the 
European and Asian populations, the only small number of patients evaluated in GENA-40 precludes 
drawing definitive conclusions with regard to the relative impacts of potential ethnicity-related effects 
and other confounders (e.g. age). With regard to the clinical relevance of potential ethnic differences in 
the PK behaviour of Human-cl rhFVIII, it is noted that results of GENA-40 do not indicate reduced 
haemostatic efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the Chinese patients under study. However, results have 
to be looked at in the context of rather conservative recommendations for prophylactic dosing in 
GENA-40 (i.e. 30-40 IU/kg every other day or 3-times weekly). Consequently, potential ethnic differ-
ences may become more relevant when comparing less conservative dosing regimens. 
Haemostatic efficacy in prophylaxis and in the treatment of BEs 
In the paediatric subgroup included in GENA-40, average doses of Human-cl rhFVIII administered per 
prophylactic infusion (i.e. median: 34.9 IU/kg in 6 - <12 year old children and 35.69 IU/kg in adoles-
cents) or for the treatment of BEs (i.e. median: 35.71 IU/kg in 6 - <12 year old children and 50.38 
IU/kg in adolescents) were largely comparable to previous trials in paediatric PTPs.  
For prophylaxis, mean monthly doses of 426.7 IU/kg in the group of 6 - <12 year old children and 
422.0 IU/kg in adolescents compare to a monthly consumption of 531.2 IU/kg reported in the long-
term paediatric extension study GENA-13 with similar recommendations regarding prophylactic treat-
ment (i.e. 30-40 IU/kg every other day or 3-times weekly). 
The median number of infusions administered for the treatment of bleeding episodes was 1 in all pae-
diatric studies with broadly comparable proportions of successfully treated events (i.e. 82.4% in GENA-
03, 83.0% in GENA-13, 82% in GENA-40, 92.9% in GENA-05, and 77.5% in GENA-15). 
Huge ranges in the number of infusions (i.e. 0-110 per BE) and total doses administered to treat BEs 
(i.e. 22.9-4036.6 IU/kg per BE) were primarily attributed to a single bleeding event in a 11-year old 
boy (a spontaneous moderate joint bleed in the right knee) for which the patient received a total of 
110 infusions over a period of 59 days. Of note, however, according to Listing 16.2.6.3-2, this patient 
had another traumatic moderate joint bleed that was successfully treated with only 2 infusions and 
these two BEs remained the only bleeding complications over a period of 6.21 months of prophylaxis 
indicating overall satisfactory efficacy. 
In GENA-40, all patients received prophylaxis for a mean duration of 6.1 months (range: 4-6.5 
months). On average, reported annualized bleeding rates are considered largely comparable to previ-
ous paediatric trials. Median ABR (IQR) was 2.89 (1.87-6.96) and 3.84 (1.89-7.77) in 6 - <12 year old 
children and adolescents, respectively. Monthly rates of >1 spontaneous bleeds (MBR) were limited to 
two adolescents; of whom one discontinued prematurely due to low compliance and the other did not 
receive treatment according to protocol. In the per-protocol population the median ABRs (IQR) for all 
BEs were 1.94 (1.87, 3.90) in 6 - <12 year old children (n=20) and 2.05 (0.95, 4.88) in the group of 
adolescents (n=12). Of note, these numbers have to be generally interpreted in the context of highly 
vulnerable population under study (i.e. children <12 years of age and adolescents), prone to trauma-
induced bleeding and/or non-compliance. The only surgical procedure with available assessment in the 
paediatric population (i.e. release of right gastrocnemius aponeurosis + lengthening of right Achilles 
tendon in a 15 year old boy) was rated as having excellent efficacy. 
Hence, overall, it is concluded that results of GENA-40 essentially confirm haemostatic efficacy of Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII in the Asian population without indicating relevant differences compared to non-Asian 
patients.

Safety data 
Safety data obtained in GENA-40 are considered consistent with previous experiences and do not indi-
cate any safety issues specific to the Asian or Asian paediatric populations. Neither types nor frequen-
cies of reported TEAEs are considered remarkable. None of the patients included in GENA-40 developed 
FVIII inhibitors and there were no reports of thromboembolic events. The only case of treatment-
emerged hypersensitivity occurred in a 43-year old patient and was considered not related to the study 
drug. Of note, this patient had already receive 45 EDs with Human-cl rhFVII before the onset of this AE 
and went on to complete the study with 80 EDs without recurrence of allergic symptoms. Although lim-
ited by the only small sample sizes of the different age groups, data from GENA-40 do not indicate any 
clinically relevant differences with regard to the safety profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in children, adoles-
cents, and adults. Overall, Human-cl rhFVIII was well tolerated and none of the reported AEs were as-
sessed as possibly/probably related to the administration of Human-cl rhFVIII.

3.  Rapporteur’s initial overall conclusion and recommenda-
tion 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should is requested provide the final clinical study report of 
GENA-40 and a critical clinical overview as part of this procedure. (see section “Additional clarification 
requested”) 
4.  Initial clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this proce-
dure: 
3.  The final clinical study report of GENA-40 has to be submitted (announced for October 2020). 
4.  A critical clinical overview has to be submitted. 
The timetable should be a 60 day response timetable, since the final report has been not submitted 
within the initial submission. 
5.  MAH responses to initial clarification request 
The MAH submitted the full study report of GENA-40 on 02 October 2020. Concerning the requested 
critical clinical overview document, the MAH referred to the Critical Expert Overview submitted togeth-
er with the final clinical study report of GENA-05 (submitted according to Art. 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006 on 24 September 2020) combining the information on both studies (GENA-05 and GENA-
40) in one report. 
As stated in the original Cover Letter, dated 03 July 2020, no amendments to be introduced to the 
Product Information, and thus no regulatory consequences, have been identified by the MAH. 
For assessment of the clinical study report  see section 2.3.

6.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion on the responses and rec-
ommendation 
In summary, data obtained in Chinese paediatric PTPs in GENA-40 do not change the favourable bene-
fit risk profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in children. The presented data do not warrant any update of the 
Product information and no regulatory actions are expected to be required. However, prior to a final 
recommendation, additional clarifications should be provided by the MAH (see section 7 below). 
  Not fulfilled, additional clarification requested. 
7.  Second additional clarification requested 
1.  The Clinical Expert Overview neglects data obtained in the group of adolescents included in 
GENA-40 (N=15). However, according to the Paediatric Regulation (No 1901/2006) and e.g. 
ICH E11, the group of adolescents (i.e. patients aged 12 to 18 years) represents a subset of 
the paediatric population.  
Hence, as part of this Article 46 procedure, the MAH should provide a critical discussion of re-
sults obtained in adolescents (including PK data) and confirm the statement that the new pae-
diatric data obtained in GENA-40 (i.e. from children <12 years and adolescents) does not war-
rant any amendments to be introduced to the PI and that no regulatory consequences were 
identified. 
2.  For the group of 6 - <12 year old children included in GENA-40, Table 3 of the Clinical Expert 
Overview specifies a range of 1-56 infusions and total doses ranging from 29.4 to 
2054.9 IU/kg (mean: 156.1 IU/kg) to treat bleeding episodes. Similarly, the synopsis and sec-
tion 11.4.7 (Efficacy conclusions) of the CSR state that (across all age groups) “The median 
number of infusions per BE was 1.0 (IQR: 1.00, 2.00; range: 0-56), and the median dose per 
episode/kg body weight was 37.97 IU/kg (IQR: 34.15, 72.30; range: 0-2055). However, ac-
cording to Table 19 of the CSR, BEs in GENA-40 were treated with up to 110 infusions and Ta-
ble 14.2.2.3-1 of the CSR further specifies a median dose per BE/kg body weight of 
35.71 IU/kg (mean: 118.57 IU/kg; range: 26.69-4036.6) in the group of 6 - <12 year old chil-
dren. Furthermore, Listing 16.2.4-1 specifies that indeed the 11-year old patient  (included in 
the PP population) received 110 infusions (over a period of 59 days) with a total dose of 
4036.6 IU/kg for the treatment of a spontaneous joint bleed.  
Hence, the MAH is requested to provide clarification on these contradicting statements and en-
sure consistency across and within both documents (i.e. CSR and Clinical Expert Overview).

8.  MAH responses to 2nd clarification request and assessment 
of the responses 
Question 1 
The Clinical Expert Overview neglects data obtained in the group of adolescents included in GENA-40 
(N=15). However, according to the Paediatric Regulation (No 1901/2006) and e.g. ICH E11, the group 
of adolescents (i.e. patients aged 12 to 18 years) represents a subset of the paediatric population.  
Hence, as part of this Article 46 procedure, the MAH should provide a critical discussion of results ob-
tained in adolescents (including PK data) and confirm the statement that the new paediatric data ob-
tained in GENA-40 (i.e. from children <12 years and adolescents) does not warrant any amendments 
to be introduced to the PI and that no regulatory consequences were identified. 
MAH’s response 
The data of the adolescent patient population was added to the Clinical Expert Overview. A revised 
version of the Clinical Expert Overview has been attached to section 2.5 of the eCTD. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the MAH included a discussion of data (PK, efficacy and safety) obtained in the 15 ado-
lescent patients included in GENA-40 in the Clinical Expert Overview. In the updated Clinical Expert 
Overview, the MAH further confirms that these data do not change the overall conclusion that “no 
changes to the current Nuwiq SmPC, or the RMP, are required based on the results of the GENA-05 
and GENA-40 studies”. Notably, this position complies with the Rapporteur’s previous recommendation 
which already took the assessment of these data into account (see Sections 2 and 6 above). 
Issue resolved 
Question 2 
For the group of 6 - <12 year old children included in GENA-40, Table 3 of the Clinical Expert Overview 
specifies a range of 1-56 infusions and total doses ranging from 29.4 to 2054.9 IU/kg (mean: 156.1 
IU/kg) to treat bleeding episodes. Similarly, the synopsis and section 11.4.7 (Efficacy conclusions) of 
the CSR state that (across all age groups) “The median number of infusions per BE was 1.0 (IQR: 
1.00, 2.00; range: 0-56), and the median dose per episode/kg body weight was 37.97 IU/kg (IQR: 
34.15, 72.30; range: 0-2055). However, according to Table 19 of the CSR, BEs in GENA-40 were 
treated with up to 110 infusions and Table 14.2.2.3-1 of the CSR further specifies a median dose per 
BE/kg body weight of 35.71 IU/kg (mean: 118.57 IU/kg; range: 26.69-4036.6) in the group of 6 - <12 
year old children. Furthermore, Listing 16.2.4-1 specifies that indeed the 11-year old patient  (included 
in the PP population) received 110 infusions (over a period of 59 days) with a total dose of 4036.6 
IU/kg for the treatment of a spontaneous joint bleed.  
Hence, the MAH is requested to provide clarification on these contradicting statements and ensure con-
sistency across and within both documents (i.e. CSR and Clinical Expert Overview). 
MAH’s response 
The data presented in the statement 
“The median number of infusions per BE was 1.0 (IQR: 1.00, 2.00; range: 0-56), and the median dose 
per episode/kg body weight was 37.97 IU/kg (IQR: 34.15, 72.30; range: 0-2055)”

derived from calculations in Section 14, Table 14.2.2.2-1. The calculation is based on the average on a 
subject basis, which means that indeed the subject  had 110 infusions for 1 BE and no infusions for a 
second BE. This results in an average of 56 infusions per BE. 
However, the MA holder acknowledges that this information should be revised in the context it is given, 
and instead of reporting the median number of infusions and dosage on a subject basis the data should 
be reported on a bleeding episode basis. Section 14, Table 14.2.2.2-5 presents the calculation based 
on bleeding episodes. The Critical Expert Overview as well as the CSR were updated accordingly (re-
vised Critical Expert Overview, Dec 2020 and GENA-40 CSR, Version 2.0, dated 02 Dec 2020). During 
the preparation of the BLA submission in China, 2 additional errors were noted and corrected in GENA-
40 CSR Version 2.0. These 2 corrections do not have any impact on the data provided in the Critical 
Expert Overview nor on the interpretation of the study results. 
During the preparation of the BLA submission in China, 2 additional errors were noted and corrected in 
GENA-40 CSR Version 2.0. These 2 corrections do not have any impact on the data provided in the 
Critical Expert Overview nor on the interpretation of the study results. The 2 additional corrections are 
as follows: 
1.  Correction of translation of an SAE report text (GENA-40 CSR, Section 12.3.2, page 71) 
2.  Correction of IVR calculations (GENA-40 CSR, Section 11.4.1.3.2; Table 26, Table 27 and Table 
28) 
A minor programming error regarding the recovery based on actual potency and standardized to 50 
IU/kg was detected which affects Section 16, List 16.2.6.2–1 and 16.2.6.2–3 and Section 14, Table 
14.2.4.1-1 to Table 14.2.4.1-24, including corresponding figures. 
In GENA-40 CSR Version 2, Table 26, 27, and 28 were revised, as well as the corresponding listings 
and tables in sections 16 and 14. The difference in the recovery calculation is as follows: 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that the contradicting statements regarding the average consumption of Human-cl 
rhFVIII for the treatment of BEs originated from calculations on a subject basis rather than on a bleed-

ing episode basis. The MAH’s decision to consistently report the consumption data on a bleeding epi-
sode basis is acknowledged. The Critical Expert Overview (previous Table 3, Table 4 in the revised 
document) as well as the CSR (Synopsis, Section 11.4.7 [Efficacy Conclusions], Section 13 [Discussion 
and overall conclusions]) were updated accordingly. The correction of two additional errors (one of 
which already previously corrected by an erratum document attached to the CSR) is acknowledged. 
Both corrections do not affect/change the overall interpretation of study results.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pregabalin Zentiva is a generic medicinal product of Lyrica, which has been authorised in the EU since 
6 July 2004.  
The active substance of Pregabalin Zentiva is pregabalin, an analogue of the neurotransmitter 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pregabalin decreases central neuronal excitability by binding to an 
auxiliary subunit (α2-δ protein) of a voltage-gated calcium channel on neurons in the central nervous 
system. Pregabalin reduces the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, 
noradrenaline, and substance P. 
The safety and efficacy profile of pregabalin has been characterised in several clinical trials, details of 
which can be found in the EPAR for Lyrica. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience 
contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic 
application referring to the reference medicinal product Lyrica, summary of the clinical data of 
pregabalin is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Pregabalin Zentiva hard capsules have the same qualitative and quantitative composition, in terms of 
active substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product Lyrica. Bioequivalence 
of the 300mg dose with the reference 300mg Lyrica capsule was demonstrated clinically. For the 
remaining doses, CHMP has accepted a biowaiver.  
The indication proposed for Pregabalin Zentiva is a subset of the indication authorized for the 
Reference medicinal product, Lyrica.  The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen 
and duration of use. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 25mg, 50mg, 75mg, 100mg, 150mg, 
200mg, 225mg, 300mg of pregabalin as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, pregelatinized maize starch, talc, gelatin (capsule body 
and capsule cap), titanium dioxide E171 (capsule body and capsule cap), black iron oxide E172 
(25/50/75/150/225/300 mg strenght capsule body and 25/50/150 mg strength capsule cap), red and 
yellow iron oxide E172(100/200 mg strenght capsule body and 75/100/200/225/300 mg strenght 
capsule cap). 
The product is available in OPA/alu/PVC/alu blisters for 25mg capsules and PVC/alu blisters for 50mg, 
75mg, 100mg, 150mg, 200mg, 225mg, 300mg capsules. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of Pregabalin is (S)-3-(Aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid and has the 
following structure: 
Pregabalin Zentiva  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/408316/2015 
Page 8/24 
 
  
 
The structure has been confirmed by the following methods: element analysis, IR, NMR, MS, X-ray 
diffraction and thermal analysis.   
The active substance is a white to off-white powder, not hygroscopic, sparingly soluble in water, and 
very slightly soluble in acetonitrile and in methanol.  
Pregabalin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. Pregabalin shows polymorphism. The active substance’s suppliers 
produce the same polymorphic form. During the polymorphic research on pregabalin, it was 
demonstrated that polymorphic form produced by active substance manufacturers is the most 
common and stable one. During the performed investigations the suppliers were unable to produce 
any other polymorph in spite of efforts made (testing of different solvents, drying options). 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedures. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is sourced from three suppliers corresponding to eleven manufacturing sites 
including seven sites involved in the manufacture of intermediates. 
Pregabalin is synthesized in 2 main chemical reactions with additional steps of purification of the 
intermediate and final drug substance (for two suppliers) and in 3 main chemical steps with additional 
step of purification of the final drug substance (for the third supplier) using commercially available 
well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Enantiopurity is controlled by the 
process and by chiral HPLC.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), methyl carbamate content (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), water content (KF), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), bromide content 
(Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Data demonstrating that the same polymorphic form is obtained from all the applied suppliers were 
provided. As each API manufacturer has demonstrated the consistency and stability of physical form 
produced, the omission of a control of the polymorphic form in the active substance specifications is 
considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Pregabalin Zentiva  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/408316/2015 
Page 9/24 
 
 
  
 
Batch analysis data of the active substance (at least 3 production scale batches for each 
manufacturing site) are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data were provided on at least 3 production scale batches of active substance from two of the 
proposed manufacturers, stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market for up to 36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines.  
Stability data were provided on at least 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from one of the 
proposed manufacturers stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market for up to 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), loss on drying and/or 
water (KF), specific optical rotation (for one active substance supplier), enantiomeric purity (HPLC or 
GC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC),particle size (for two active substance suppliers) 
microbiologic quality (for one active substance supplier).  
Additional investigations on the stability of the polymorphic form demonstrated sufficient physical 
stability of polymorph produced by active substance manufacturers.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The substance 
was found to be photostable. Results on stress conditions were also provided for one batch of each 
manufacturer. Stress conditions studies included: elevated temperature, light, oxidizing, alkaline and 
acidic medium, high humidity. Results showed that pregabalin in solid state very slightly degrades 
when exposed to heat, to high humidity or when exposed to oxidation combined with heating. 
Pregabalin degrades when exposed to heat in solution or when exposed to extreme basic condition or 
acidic conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the retest period proposed by the ASMF holders. 
However the finished product manufacturing site has confirmed that no re-test period is used for the 
drug substance and that the full analysis is performed on the drug substance each time before it is 
included in the finished product manufacturing process. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The objective was to develop a hard gelatine capsule containing pregabalin bioequivalent to the 
reference medicinal product Lyrica. 
Comparison of the impurity profiles, water content and particle size distribution of API batches 
supplied from different suppliers used in the pilot productions of Pregabalin 300 mg Hard Capsules 
were provided. Results showed no significant differences. 
Due to high solubility of pregabalin, particle size distribution of the active substance was considered 
as a non-critical parameter. 
Studies were provided to demonstrate the absence of polymorphic form change during finished 
product manufacture and stability. 
Pregabalin Zentiva  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/408316/2015 
Page 10/24 
 
  
 
The qualitative composition of the generic product is identical to the reference product except for the 
excipient pregelatinised starch that is used instead of maize starch due to better flow properties and 
except for the capsule shell composition (absence of sodium laurilsulphate/silica colloidal anhydrous, 
different colorants used compared to the reference product) and except for the printing inks 
composition. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards or with EC regulation for the colorants Black/Red/Yellow iron oxides. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
The compatibility of the active substance with lactose was described based on literature data and 
stability studies results. Pregabalin drug substance as a primary amine can form conjugates with 
lactose by undergoing Maillard reaction. Forming of conjugates was confirmed for Pregabalin pilot 
batches during the stability studies and it is also comparable to original product Lyrica. 
Strengths of 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 225 mg and 300 mg of Pregabalin hard capsules were 
developed like Lyrica capsules to be dose proportional to each other and to contain 75 % of 
pregabalin. 
Unlike the reference product, Pregabalin 50 mg hard capsules were developed to be manufactured 
like higher strengths of Pregabalin capsules, to be dose proportional to higher strengths of Pregabalin 
hard capsules and contains 75 % of pregabalin. 
The lowest strength, 25 mg of Pregabalin hard capsules, was intended to be developed like higher 
strengths of Pregabalin hard capsules, but since the amount was too small for encapsulation into 
available sizes of capsules, it was not possible. A different composition was prepared. The ratios of 
lactose and pregelatinized starch in the formulation were increased compare to the composition of 
Lyrica 25 mg capsules and the same percentage amount of glidant talc was used compare to 
formulations of Pregabalin hard capsules strengths from 50 mg to 300 mg. 
The similarity of developed product with reference product was assessed by comparison of dissolution 
and impurity profiles and by bioequivalence study. 
The dissolution profiles of all strengths of Pregabalin, manufactured with API from all three proposed 
suppliers, were compared with the ones of Lyrica. The profiles were determined for 0.1 NHCl, 0.067 M 
HCl and buffers of pH 4.5 and 6.8. Bioequivalence between the investigational drug Pregabalin 300 
mg capsules and the reference drug Lyrica 300 mg capsules has been demonstrated. For the 50-mg, 
75-mg, 100-mg, 150-mg, 200-mg and 225-mg strengths, the applicant applies for biowaiver based 
on the general requirements for biowaiver of an additional strength, while for the strength 25-mg 
Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based biowaiver was requested. Pregabalin is a BCS 
class I drug and a BCS-based biowaiver is acceptable for all strengths. Based on the results from 
dissolution tests (> 85 % within 15 minutes at three pH levels), pregabalin hard capsules are an 
immediate release formulations meeting criteria for a BCS-based biowaiver according to the 
Bioequivalence Guideline. (see also clinical section). 
The development of the dissolution method is described and the discriminatory power has been 
demonstrated. 
The impurity profiles of both generic and reference products in all strengths are similar. 
The manufacturing process development was started with the strength 300 mg. Two different way of 
production were tested - wet granulation and direct mixing. Batch produced by wet granulation 
showed deterioration of impurity profile due to water, which contributes to Maillard reaction. After 
that the flowability and compressibility of the batches obtained by direct mixing but containing 
Pregabalin Zentiva  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/408316/2015 
Page 11/24 
 
  
 
different excipient composition were evaluated. The batch formulation containing lactose 
monohydrate, pregelatinised starch showed the best results and was used for preparation of pilot 
batches. 
The primary packaging is OPA/alu/PVC/alu blisters for 25mg capsules and PVC/alu blisters for 50mg, 
75mg, 100mg, 150mg, 200mg, 225mg, 300mg capsules. The material complies with Ph.Eur.and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: blend preparation, encapsulation, and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three 
consecutive pilot batches of Pregabalin 25mg hard capsules, on pregabalin common granule and one 
batch of each strength. All proposed active substance suppliers were used in the validation batches. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The manufacturing process will be validated according to the process validation protocol on three 
consecutive production batches of each strength.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form : 
appearance, average mass of one capsule, identification (UPLC, IR), identification of colorants( Ph. 
Eur.), assay (UPLC), uniformity of dosage units ( Ph. Eur.), dissolution test (UPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), microbial count (Ph.Eur.), Escherichia coli, water content (KF), disintegration (Ph. 
Eur.).  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The in house analytical procedures are described and validated.  
Batch analysis results are provided for one pilot scale batch for the 100mg strength, two pilot scale 
batches of the 200/225 mg strengths, three pilot scale batches of the 25/50/150 mg strengths, 4 pilot 
scale batches of the 75/300mg strengths manufactured with active substance batches from two 
suppliers. Batch analysis results confirmed the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for eight pilot scale batches of 25/50/150/300mg strenghts, four pilot 
scale batches of 75mg strength, one pilot scale batch of 100/200/225 mg strength of finished product 
stored under long term conditions for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, 12 month at 30 ºC / 65% RH and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. 
The stability batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. 27 of the stability batches were manufactured using active 
substance batches from the three proposed suppliers. 
Samples were tested according to release specifications except for uniformity of dosage units (not 
performed) and except for the limits for total impurities and water content (wider limit at shelf life). 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The limit for dissolution specification has been 
Pregabalin Zentiva  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/408316/2015 
Page 12/24 
 
  
 
tightened during the procedure, however in the stability study old wider specification was used. The 
CHMP recommended that the applicant investigate the dissolution after 15 min in stability studies and 
provide relevant results whenever the data obtained at the next testing point is available. 
In addition, one batch of 25/75 mg strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Results showed that the drug product is 
not light sensitive. 
Stress degradation tests also showed that pregabalin drug product is acid sensitive, unstable at 10N 
NaOH, not stable at oxidizing condition (30 % H2O2), at 40°C and not stable at 90°C. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life is 2 years and the storage condition is “Do not store 
above 30°C”. They are acceptable and included in the SmPC.  
Adventitious agents 
Excipients lactose monohydrate and gelatin are of animal origin. 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  Data has 
been presented to give assurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Dissolution after 15 minutes should be investigated in stability studies and relevant results should be 
provided whenever the data obtained at next testing point is available.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology was provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Pregabalin Zentiva manufactured by Zentiva k.s. is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all pregabalin containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
N/A 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview presented by the applicant is largely based on published scientific literature 
which is acceptable since pregabalin is a well-known active substance.  
There are no objections to the approval of Pregabalin Zentiva from a non-clinical point of view. The 
SmPC of Pregabalin Zentiva is in line with that of the reference product Lyrica and is therefore 
acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing pregabalin. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted 1 bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting 
conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) are of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

Exemption  
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), if the pharmacokinetic of the active substance is linear 
and that the bioequivalence is demonstrated for one strength, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the 
other strengths could be waived. An exemption from the requirement to perform bioequivalence 
studies would be justified when the following conditions are met: the pharmaceutical products have 
the same manufacturer, same qualitative composition, same ratio between active substance and 
excipients and in vitro dissolution profile comparable to the reference product. 
The composition of the strengths 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 225 and 300 mg of the test product is 
quantitatively proportional. A tabular listing of the composition of the respective strengths and their 
dissolution curves at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 showed that more than 85% of the drug was dissolved within 
15 minutes at all pH values tested. Therefore, one single-dose bioequivalence study has been 
conducted with the highest 300 mg strength only. The results of this study can be extrapolated to 
other strengths.  
The 25-mg strength formulation of Pregabalin capsules does not have a quantitatively proportional 
composition to the other strengths. Therefore, the applicant applied for BCS-based biowaiver for the 
25-mg, meeting the criteria described in the Appendix III of the Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1). Pregabalin is a BCS-class I drug as it is highly 
soluble and permeable compound. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that pregabalin is rapidly 
absorbed with bioavailability >90%, with mean tmax values ranging from 0.7 to 1.3 hours, the 
pharmacokinetics is linear in the therapeutic dose range 
Based on these results and considerations, the CHMP concluded that the general biowaiver criteria 
were met. Therefore, a bioequivalence study with the 300mg dose and a biowaiver for the additional 
strengths and BSC-based biowaiver for 25 mg were considered adequate. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 1 bioequivalence study.

Study 18/10/PRG/BSD: A Two-Way, Randomized, Single-Dose, Cross-Over, Balanced, Fasted Study 
of Pregabalin Zentiva 300 mg Capsules in Healthy Volunteers. 
Methods 
Study design  
This  was  a  single  dose  bioequivalence  study  under  fasting  conditions  to  demonstrate  essential 
similarity between the test and reference product.  
After an overnight fast, subjects were given the test or the reference product with 250 ml of water. 
Water was not permitted 1 hour before dosing and until 1 hour post-dosing. The subjects were served 
meals at 4 h post dose in both periods. Subjects were housed in clinical facilities until 36 hours post 
dose.  There  was  a  washout  period  of  7  days  between  the  study  periods.  Following  each  drug 
administration, blood samples were taken at 0 (pre-drug), 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2, 
3, 5, 9, 14, 24, 30 and 36 hours.

Test and reference products  
Pregabalin Zentiva 300 mg manufactured by Zentiva, a.s. (batch No. Pilot 01, manufacturing date 
08/2010; exp. date October 15, 2011) has been compared to Lyrica 300mg manufactured by Pfizer 
(Batch No: 0517031F, exp. date February 28, 2014).  
Population studied   
The number of subjects enrolled to the study was calculated using the following intrasubject variances 
(based on literature data): ≤ 10% and ≤ 15% for AUC and Cmax, respectively. The minimal number 
of  subjects  based  on  the  criterion  to  achieve  90%  probability  of  concluding  bioequivalence  if  the 
difference between test and reference treatment is ≤ 8% was 22. To account for subject withdrawal 
and dropouts due to adverse events, non-compliance or personal reasons, 24 subjects were planned 
to be randomized and dosed.  
Healthy male subjects (19 to 41 years of age) with a normal weight, liver and kidney function and no 
prior  drug  use  were  admitted.  Subjects  were  allocated  to  study  treatments  according  to  the 
randomization schedule. 24 subjects were enrolled and completed both study periods. 
Analytical methods   
LC-MS/MS method was used for the determination of pregabalin plasma concentrations. The method 
was based on protein precipitation as a sample preparation technique, HPLC separation on a 
pentafluorophenylpropyl column and tandem mass spectrometric detection. 
Total number of 768 samples was received for the determination of pregabalin in plasma, they were 
stored at -18 ºC. Calibration standards (range 144.3-14 960 ng/ml, 7 levels) and quality control 
samples (concentrations 428.3, 3046 and 12 680 ng/ml) were prepared on September 21, 2011. 
Plasma samples were analyzed in 9 analytical runs, including incurred sample analysis, all meeting 
the acceptance criteria.  
Accuracy and precision was calculated based on the back calculated concentrations of calibration 
curve samples and QC samples (concentrations 428.3, 3046 and 12 680 ng/ml). The pregabalin levels 
in samples with measured concentration < 144.3 ng/ml (LLOQ) were reported as 0. Across sample 
analysis accuracy and precision was within ±10%. Incurred sample reanalysis included 80 samples, 
for 8% of incurred samples reanalyzed, original result differed more than 20%, whereas median 
difference was 6.95%. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The following parameters were calculated: Cmax and tmax were determined directly from the 
observed values; AUC(0-t) was calculated by linear trapezoidal rule and AUC(0-∞) determined by 
extrapolation to infinity; terminal rate constant β was obtained by linear regression analysis of the 
terminal phase of the ln C - time curve. The terminal halftime t1/2 was calculated as 0.6931/β. The 
estimated Clast* instead of observed value Clast was used in the calculation of AUC(0-∞). 
Statistical methods   
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on logarithmically transformed AUCs and 
Cmax values. The terms used in the ANOVA model were sequence, subject within sequence, period 
and formulation. To test for bioequivalence based on AUC(0-t) and Cmax (primary parameters) the

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
A  single  dose  bioequivalence  study  was  considered  sufficient  since  the  application  concerns  an 
immediate  release  formulation.    Steady  state  studies  are  not  required  as  no  accumulation  of 
pregabalin  is  expected,  and  bioavailability  is  not  affected  by  repeated  doses.  A  single  dose  study 
under fasting conditions is an acceptable study design since the reference product can be taken with 
or  without  food.  Considering  that  pregabalin  is  a  BCS  class  I  drug,  a  BCS-based  biowaiver  for  all 
strengths would have been acceptable. 
Analytical and validation reports were included in the final report. Analytical methods were validated 
and  met  the  criteria  in  the  EMA  Guideline  on  Bioanalytical  Method  Validation.  Pregabalin  stability 
under various storage conditions had been demonstrated. Long term stability covered the real sample 
storage time. None of the determined concentrations exceeded the upper calibration limit and the 
maximum  concentration  determined  was  9.6  µg/mL.  None  of  the  predose  samples  contained 
detectable amount of pregabalin, indicating that the length of washout period was sufficient. None of 
the  first  post-dose  samples  was  a  Cmax-sample  indicating  that  blood  collection  times  were 
appropriately placed. 
There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported during the conduct of the study. The safety 
of  pregabalin  is  well  documented  and  both  test  and  reference  products  are  expected  to  have  a 
comparable safety profile.  
Bioequivalence  between  the  investigational  drug  Pregabalin  Zentiva  300  mg  capsules  and  the 
reference drug Lyrica 300 mg capsules has been demonstrated. The 90%CIs are within the standard 
bioequivalence limit 90.00%-125.00%. Design of the bioequivalence study was acceptable. None of 
the predose samples contained detectable amount of pregabalin, indicating the washout period was 
sufficient. None of the first post-dose samples was observed as a Cmax-sample, indicating that blood 
collection times were appropriately placed. Area extrapolated to infinity for AUC(0-∞) calculation was 
less than 6%, indicating sufficient blood collection time. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the results of the pivotal bioequivalence study submitted, Pregabalin Zentiva hard capsules 
are considered bioequivalent to Lyrica hard capsules.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance

2.7.  PSUR submission 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
After the successful readability user testing, the applicant changed the font of the package leaflet. For 
the revised version of the leaflet, the applicant has made a bridging to the Zentiva house style. The 
house style has been successfully user tested in several procedures and therefore additional separate 
user testing is not needed. The CHMP accepted the bridging to design and layout. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pregabalin hard capsules. The reference product Lyrica 
is indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, adjunctive therapy 
in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised 
Pregabalin Zentiva  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/408316/2015

Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. Pregabalin Zentiva indication is limited to adjunctive therapy in 
adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults, which is acceptable. No nonclinical studies have been provided for 
this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active 
substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does 
not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and 
safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a two-way, randomized, single-dose, 
cross-over design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Pregabalin Zentiva met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the reference product. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the 
parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance 
range. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.  
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Pregabalin capsules 300 mg are considered 
bioequivalent with Lyrica™ hard capsules 300 mg with respect to rate and extent of absorption of 
Pregabalin. The results of this study can be extrapolated to other strengths: 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 
150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg, according to conditions in the relevant Guideline. For 25 mg strength, 
BCS-based biowaiver was granted.   
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensusthat the benefit-risk balance of Pregabalin Zentiva in the treatment of  
Epilepsy 
Pregabalin Zentiva is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation. 
Generalised anxiety disorder 
Pregabalin Zentiva is indicated for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults.

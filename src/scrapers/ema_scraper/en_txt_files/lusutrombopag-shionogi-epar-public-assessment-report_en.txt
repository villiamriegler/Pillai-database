2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic liver disease (CLD), independent of aetiology, is commonly associated with thrombocytopenia 
due to a number of different causes. Contributing factors are, among others, decreased hepatic 
production of the haematopoietic growth factor thrombopoetin, sequestration of platelets in the spleen 
and suppression of the bone marrow.  
Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150,000/µL. It can be further specified as 
moderate (50-100,000/µL) and severe (<50,000/µL). Low platelet counts in CLD increase the risk of 
bleeding during and after surgery and invasive procedures. Clinical practice guidelines vary with their 
recommendation of desirable platelet levels before attempting an elective procedure. However, it is 
generally agreed that many invasive procedures like liver biopsies can be done safely with platelet counts 
above 50-75,000/µL. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CLD includes a number of long-term liver diseases of diverse aetiology. Some of these diseases may be 
viral in origin (e.g., hepatitis B and C); others may be caused by toxins (e.g., alcohol), metabolic 
disorders (e.g., non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), autoimmune disorders (e.g., primary 
sclerosing cholangitis), or other factors. Regardless of the aetiology, CLD is generally characterized by 
gradual, irreversible destruction of the liver and many associated complications. The damage to the liver 
may be slowed, however, with lifestyle changes and/or appropriate medical and surgical management. 
Today a majority of patients are surviving their CLD [Newton JL et al, 2012], but live with many 
disease-related morbidities managed (with limited success) by drugs and surgical procedures. 
Despite the high incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD, thrombocytopenia with a platelet 
count of < 50,000/μL is rare and, although literature on frequency is lacking, is thought to occur in only 
1% to 2.6% of the CLD patient population [Afdhal et al 2008, Bashour FN, et al 2000,Giordano N, et al 
2005]. 
The risk of bleeding varies depending on the procedure, the skills of the clinician performing the 
procedure, and the individual characteristics of the patient, but patients with CLD are generally 
considered at increased risk of this potentially serious event during or after the procedure if the platelet 
count is below 50,000/μL to 60,000/μL [Qureshi K, et al 2016]. 
Consequently, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures essential to the care of this patient population may 
be delayed [Mitchell O et al, 2016, Hayashi H, et al 2014], thus exacerbating the patient’s condition and 
directly or indirectly increasing morbidity and mortality. For example, a delay in administration of 
chemotherapy in a patient with hepatocellular cancer may impact the patient’s survival, and a postponed 
endoscopy may put the patient at increased risk of a bleeding episode due to undiagnosed bleeding 
esophageal varices. In addition, the thrombocytopenia may also delay or prevent routine diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures not related to the underlying liver disease, for example, routine dental care [Silva 
et al 2012]. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Thrombocytopenia commonly develops in patients with CLD regardless of the aetiology of the liver 
disease [Mitchell O et al 2016] and has been reported in up to 76% of patients with CLD [Afdhal et al 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 10/142 
 
 
 
2008]. In clinical studies, its prevalence varies depending on such factors as the severity of the liver 
disease and the laboratory threshold value used to define this hematologic abnormality [Giannini EG. et 
al 2006]. The thrombocytopenia is multifactorial in origin in this patient population, with its causes 
including decreased platelet production due to decreased levels of the hematopoietic growth factor 
thrombopoietin (TPO), as well as suppression of platelet production in the bone marrow due to various 
causes; splenic sequestration of platelets in the presence of splenomegaly; and increased platelet 
destruction due to various causes [Mitchell O et al 2016, Giannini EG. et al 2006, Hayashi H, et al 2014]. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
A low platelet count is considered a major contributory factor to an increased risk of bleeding during and 
after invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that are often required to optimally manage this 
patient population [Hayashi H, et al 2014, Qureshi K, et al 2016, Giannini EG, et al 2010]. In one study, 
31% of patients with CLD undergoing a procedure and a platelet count < 75,000/μL had a 
procedure-related bleeding complication [Giannini EG, et al 2010]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, platelet transfusion is the only nonsurgical treatment available to correct clinically relevant 
thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD prior to invasive procedures [Qureshi K, et al 2016]. There are no 
international consensus guidelines that currently define the threshold platelet count below which platelet 
transfusion is needed prior to invasive procedures in this patient population [Maan R, et al 2015]. Thus, 
clinicians may rely on local guidelines, which recommend prophylactic administration of platelets to 
achieve a platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL prior to many invasive procedures [American Red Cross. A 
compendium of transfusion practice guidelines. Third edition. 2017]. 
About the product 
Lusutrombopag (S-888711) is an orally active, small-molecule TPO receptor agonist. Lusutrombopag 3 
mg once daily for 7 days is proposed for use in the treatment of patients with CLD who have 
thrombocytopenia and are at increased risk of bleeding associated with planned invasive procedures. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“ Treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease who are at increased risk for 
bleeding associated with elective invasive procedures.” 
The following indication was agreed by CHMP: 
“ Treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease undergoing invasive 
procedures (see section 5.1).” 
The recommended dose is 3 mg lusutrombopag once daily for 7 days. The procedure should be performed 
from day 9 after the start of lusutrombopag treatment. Platelet count should be measured prior to the 
procedure. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

The product is available in OPA/Aluminium foil/PVC film blisters with push through aluminium lidding foil, 
as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lusutrombopag is (2E)-3-{2,6-dichloro-4-[(4-{3-[(1S)-1-(hexyloxy)-
ethyl]-2-methoxyphenyl}-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)carbamoyl]phenyl}-2-methylprop-2-enoic acid 
corresponding to the molecular formula C29H32Cl2N2O5S. It has a relative molecular mass of 591.54 g/mol 
and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of lusutrombopag was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry, 
elemental analysis, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy, and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active substance were 
measured by x-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and water adsorption/desorption. 
The active substance is a white to slightly yellowish-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is 
practically insoluble in aqueous media between pH 1 and 9, slightly soluble in alcoholic solvents, and 
freely soluble in DMF. The active substance is milled to reduce particle size. 
Studies showed that crystalline form 1, the proposed commercial form, is the most thermodynamically 
stable. The final crystallisation conditions have been developed to produce the desired form 1 – these 
conditions have also been shown to convert other forms to form 1. It was also demonstrated that the 
crystalline form is stable during milling, storage, and finished product formulation. 
Lusutrombopag has 1 chiral centre and an olefin with two potential geometric isomers. The chiral centre 
has the (S)-configuration and is introduced during the synthetic process. The olefin has the 
(E)-configuration but is susceptible to isomerisation on exposure to light. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely in both an intermediate and active substance by chiral HPLC. The geometric isomer is tested in 
intermediates and the active substance by HPLC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Lusutrombopag is synthesized in four main steps, followed by milling, using well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. Data have been provided to demonstrate that the intermediates 
are stable for the proposed holding times in the defined packaging.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018

Target set-points have been set for relevant process parameters and critical process parameters (CPPs) 
have been defined. Detailed impurity fate and purge studies have been documented. Relevant impurities 
are monitored by in-process controls (IPCs) and controlled as appropriate in intermediate specifications. 
PARs have been established for the CPPs, based on univariate experiments and have been adequately 
justified. Target set-points are defined for each CPP and it is clarified that no design space is claimed. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials, solvents and reagents have been presented and are in-line with 
the impurity fate and purge studies. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. The control of mutagenic impurities has been adequately justified in line 
with ICH M7. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. The route has stayed the same throughout development, and any changes to 
reagents, solvents and process parameters were intended to improve processing and reduce relevant 
impurities. All changes have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The active substance is packaged in double low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and sealed with plastic 
ties. The LDPE bags are then placed into a secondary container, such as a fibre container for storage and 
shipping.  The  primary  packaging  complies  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC  10/2011  as 
amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identity (IR, UV), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), enantiomer (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. There is a test for particle 
size to ensure the performance of the active substance once formulated. Since no microbial growth was 
observed during stability studies, a microbial limit test is not deemed necessary.  Relevant elemental and 
mutagenic impurities are controlled in intermediates in line with ICH Q3D and M7 respectively. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 12 batches of the active substance manufactured over the course of the 
development phase were provided. Of these, the last 3 were manufactured using the final commercial 
route and by the proposed commercial manufacturer on production scale and the results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications and overall control strategy are based on the active substance critical 
quality attributes (CQAs). 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. In addition, data on three batches of active substance manufactured using the 
commercial process but milled at a different site (using equivalent equipment) were provided, covering up 
Assessment report

to 48 months under long term conditions and 6 months under accelerated conditions. The parameters 
tested were the same as for release with the exclusion of residual solvents and residue on ignition. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating as demonstrated by 
forced degradation studies. Under both long term and accelerated conditions, all related substances and 
total impurities remained less than the reporting thresholds at all time-points for all batches. No changes 
to water content or particle size distribution were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. There was an increase 
in one impurity over time although all other parameters remained constant. The active substance should 
be stored protected from light. 
Results under stressed conditions indicate that lusutrombopag is susceptible to hydrolysis under acidic or 
basic conditions, is photosensitive in solution, but is stable to oxidation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container to 
protect from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 3 mg 
lusutrombopag. They are light red, round and debossed on 1 side with “551” and the MAA trademark and 
on the other with “3.” 
The aim of development was to produce an immediate-release solid oral dosage form meeting the 
compendial requirements. Accordingly, the quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined and the 
associated CQAs were identified and justified. 
Lusutrombopag is practically insoluble in aqueous media below pH 9, though is slightly soluble at pH 11. 
Therefore, excipients were investigated during formulation development that could enhance the active 
substance solubility and promote dissolution. The inclusion of the chosen excipients was adequately 
justified following a question from CHMP. 
The compatibility of the active substance with the various excipients was tested using binary mixtures 
since it is known to be photosensitive. No incompatibilities were seen with the individual excipients. All 
excipients with the exception of MgO are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There is no Ph. Eur. monograph for the particular grade of MgO 
required for the product.. In addition to the compendial tests, MgO is tested for tapped bulk density which 
discriminates it from other grades. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
In order to establish a suitable dissolution medium, the applicant investigated aqueous media across a 
range of pHs. In addition the effects of different surfactants were examined. The compendial paddle 
apparatus was chosen, and the rotation speed optimised to give a robust profile. CHMP raised major 
objections about the composition of the dissolution medium and the proposed specification. The 
discriminatory power of the method had not been demonstrated. In response, the applicant was able to 
demonstrate that a surfactant is indeed required by comparing profiles with and without surfactant. The 
amount of surfactant used was reduced as an interim measure and a commitment was made to replace it 
with a different surfactant Furthermore, the specification was tightened to ensure that slower dissolving 
batches are rejected. The revised method was re-validated successfully. In order to assess the 
discriminatory power, three batches were manufactured with modified manufacturing process 
parameters. It was shown that these batches would not meet the revised specification, thereby,

EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 14/142 
 
 
 
demonstrating sufficient discriminatory power. . The major objections raised in relation to the dissolution 
method were therefore considered resolved and the post-approval commitment was noted. 
A detailed description of the process development was given. Each unit operation was assessed for 
potential of process parameters to impact the CQAs of the finished product. Risk was assessed based on 
extensive prior experience of tablet manufacture in the same equipment. The definition of CPPs and 
non-CPPs has been adequately justified and the control of the relevant parameters for each unit operation 
is sufficient. 
The pivotal phase 3 studies were conducted with tablets identical to those planned for commercialisation. 
Bridging to tablets of different strengths used in earlier trials was adequately demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is OPA/Aluminium foil/PVC film blisters with push through aluminium lidding foil.  
The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 10 main steps: pre-mixing, screening, wet granulation, drying, 
screening and milling, blending with extra-granular excipients, lubrication, compression, film-coating and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. The manufacturing 
process was described in detail, including target set-points and any allowed variability in each step. The 
control strategy has been explained and is deemed suitable. 
Stability data for bulk intermediates has been provided for 1 batch, in the proposed container closure 
systems. Other than the bulk tablets, the proposed holding times are 30 days or less. For the bulk tablets, 
a  holding  time  is  proposed  in  LDPE  bags.  Data  were  generated  from  a  batch  stored  under  ambient 
conditions  of  the  commercial  warehouse.  Data  were  provided  for  a  second  batch,  which  supports  the 
conclusions from the first batch. The applicant committed to communicate any out of specification results 
from this second batch to the authorities. This was considered acceptable. The supplier of LDPE bags was 
unable to confirm compliance with regulation EC 10/2011. The applicant has provided a commitment to 
source a new supplier of LDPE bags, which was accepted by CHMP, given the low risk to patients. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  manufacture  of  six  consecutive 
production  scale  batches,  incorporating  three  different  batches  of  active  substance,  according  to  the 
process description. The tablets sampled at the beginning and end of each run, after compression, met 
the acceptance criteria for all physical characteristics. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form  including  description,  identification  (HPLC/UV),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  and  microbiological 
examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed limits for degradation products, water content, and dissolution were tightened during the 
procedure at the request of CHMP and are now considered justified. A risk assessment was carried out in 
line with ICH Q3D to investigate the potential presence of class 1 and 2 elemental impurities. Data was 
provided to demonstrate that elemental impurity levels are consistently below the relevant control 
thresholds. Therefore, no testing for elemental impurities is mandated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 15/142 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 19 batches used for clinical, stability, and validation studies 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Mulpleta are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. In addition, supportive 
stability data from 3 batches was provided for up to 24 months under long term conditions. Samples were 
tested for description, assay, degradation products, water content, dissolution, and microbiological 
examination. With the exception of degradation products, none of the measured parameters changed 
significantly over the duration of the study. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No degradation was observed indicating that the film-coat provides 
sufficient protection from light. However, it was noted during the study that moisture content increased, 
indicating that the packaging is required to protect the product from moisture. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out in the solid phase (different temperature and humidity 
conditions and in solution (acid, base and peroxide). The solid samples were stable whereas the most 
degradation was observed with aqueous base. This study demonstrates that the impurities and assay 
methods are stability indicating. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months in the original package to protect 
from moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is of vegetal 
origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Adequate data and justifications were provided by the applicant 
in order to resolve the major objections on the product composition and dissolution method raised by 
CHMP during the procedure. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
The applicant should replace the surfactant that is currently used in the dissolution medium, with 
an alternative before January 2021. 
The applicant should find an alternative source of LDPE bags used to store the bulk tablets who is 
able to confirm compliance with regulation EC 10/2011. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lusutrombopag is a novel small-molecule human TPO receptor agonist having orally-active 
pharmacological action. It is well known that TPO upregulates differentiation and growth of hematopoietic 
stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells to upregulate maturation of megakaryocytes, leading to 
the release of platelets from matured megakaryocytes. Lusutrombopag acts on the transmembrane 
domain on TPO receptors expressed on megakaryocytes to induce proliferation and differentiation of 
megakaryocyte progenitor cells via 2 signaling pathways (the Janus kinase [JAK]−signal transducer and 
activator of transcription [STAT] pathway and the Ras−p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] 
pathway), leading to platelet production. This assumption was the basis for starting the conclusion about 
the usefulness of the lusutrombopag for the treatment of patients with thrombocytopenia.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies of lusutrombopag were conducted to investigate proliferative activity 
in human TPO receptor-expressing cells and cytokine-dependent cell lines, megakaryocyte 
colony-forming ability in human bone marrow-derived CD34 positive cells, and signaling pathways in 
human TPO receptor-expressing cells. Furthermore, thrombocytopoietic effect was investigated in 
knock-in mice (i.e. mice having chimeric TPO receptors with the human TPO receptor transmembrane 
domain knocked-in to the mouse TPO receptor [TPOR-Ki/Shi mouse]). Proliferative activity of 
lusutrombopag metabolites was investigated in Ba/F3-hMpl cells-expressing human TPO receptor (Mpl is 
the TPO receptor).

Primary pharmacodynamic studies of lusutrombopag were conducted to investigate proliferative activity 
in human TPO receptor-expressing cells and cytokine-dependent cell lines, megakaryocyte 
colony-forming ability in human bone marrow-derived CD34 positive cells, and signaling pathways in 
human TPO receptor-expressing cells. In order to investigate the thrombocytopoietic effect of 
lusutrombopag in vivo, TPOR-Ki/Shi mice were produced, which have chimeric TPO receptors where the 
human TPO receptor transmembrane domain knocked-in to the mouse TPO receptor. Proliferative activity 
of lusutrombopag metabolites was investigated in Ba/F3-hMpl cells-expressing human TPO receptor. As a 
secondary pharmacology study, crossing of lusutrombopag and erythropoietin (EPO) or the granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was investigated in human bone marrow-derived CD34 positive cells.   
In vitro 
Lusutrombopag presents the S-enantiomer of an orally administered, novel small-molecule human TPO 
receptor agonist. The (+)-lusutrombopag form is specified as an impurity and shows pharmacological 
activity and lusutrombopag is not chirally transformed in vivo. 
The choice of the S-enantiomer of lusutrombopag instead of (+)-lusutrombopag with the observation of 
a higher increase in platelets in rats was explained, the absence of inducing any hepatic metabolising 
enzyme in rats up to 100 mg/kg/day and the absence of any chiral inversion. A preliminary 2-week 
toxicity study in rats showed no differences in toxic findings between both enantiomers.  
Pharmacological activity of lusutrombopag was evaluated non-clinically in direct comparison to 
eltrombopag and/or recombinant hTPO: 
Proliferative activity of lusutrombopag was shown on the in vitro level in Ba/F3-hMpl cells (murine, mIL-3 
dependent Pro-B cell line) expressing the human TPO receptor with EC50 of 84 nmol/L (rhTPO: 0.08 
nmol/L), but no proliferation was observed in non-transfected (TPO receptor negative) Ba/F3 cells. 
The absence of receptor promiscuity of lusutrombopag against human EPO, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 
receptors was confirmed by measuring proliferative effect on the respective cytokine-dependent cell lines 
(Ba/F3-hEPOR cells, NOMO-1 cells, and TF-1 cell). The effects of lusutrombopag on IFN-alfa and 
IFN-gamma receptors were not investigated. However, sufficient evidence can be built by extrapolation 
from data with other TPO-receptor agonists such as eltrombopag, where no effect on IFN-alfa and 
IFN-gamma receptors were observed (Erickson-Miller et al 2009).   
The signal transduction pathway of lusutrombopag in comparison to TPO was investigated on Ba/F3-hMpl 
cells, and showed phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, and p44/42 MAPK for both. The outcome of in 
vitro studies by stimulation of Ba/F3-hMpl cells indicates a comparable mechanism of action. 
Lusutrombopag acts additively with TPO: Although no in vitro combination studies with TPO and 
lusutrombopag were conducted, evidence for additivity is provided based on data from proliferation and 
activation assays in N2C-Tpo cells with eltrombopag and TPO. Above that it is shown that TPO binds to the 
extracellular domain of the TPO receptor while eltrombopag binds to the transmembrane domain – thus 
no binding competition with TPO is expected. For lusutrombopag a study report (EB-317-N) was provided 
showing that H499 in the transmembrane domain of TPO receptor is essential for lusutrombopag to exert 
its action. This was measured by proliferation activities and JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and p44/42 MAPK 
phosphorylation on respective cell lines, i.e. with or without Histidine 499 substitution on the TPO 
receptor. Importantly, the relevance of the 499th amino acid histidine on the TPO receptor is known for 
eltrombopag. As such appropriate evidence is provided to cover this aspect. 
In signal transduction studies of washed human platelets eltrombopag stimulates platelet signal 
transduction with little or no effect on overall platelet function, in contrast to TPO, which significantly 
primes platelet activation via phosphorylation of AKT as well as STAT1, 3, and 5 (Erhardt et al. 2009).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 18/142 
 
 
 
Phosphorylation status of some downstream signalling proteins for lusutrombopag was provided in 
comparison to hTPO. TPO acts mainly via the three signaling pathways of JAK2, MAPK, and AKT 
phosphorylation [1]. Lusutrombopag has been demonstrated to activate two main pathways, MAPK and 
JAK2 (including STAT3/5 which are downstream signaling molecules of JAK2). Based on the evidence that 
binding sites and mechanism of action of eltrombopag and lusutrombopag are the same, AKT 
phosphorylation by lusutrombopag was not investigated. Eltrombopag induced AKT phosphorylation in 
human platelets, albeit to a lesser degree compared to rhTPO (Jeong et al. 2015). Although this aspect 
remains an interesting matter of research, the impact on a final benefit risk assessment is considered 
neglectable. 
Deshexyl and 5-keto lusutrombopag were detected as metabolites in human plasma after oral 
administration, showing proliferative activity far below the parent molecule (EC50: deshexyl = 34861.0 
nmol/L and 5-keto = 555.7 nmol/L). 
Lusutrombopag confirmed its thrombopoietic activity in human bone marrow derived CD34+ cells by cell 
differentiation to megakaryocytes with an EC50 of 0.31 µmol/L (defining the maximum signal derived 
from rhTPO stimulation as 100%). 
In vivo 
Due to species specific activity of lusutrombopag TPOR-Ki/Shi mice (having chimeric TPO receptors with 
the human TPO receptor transmembrane domain knocked-in to the mouse TPO receptor) were used to 
examine thrombocytopoietic activities in vivo: H499 in the human transmembrane domain of humans and 
chimpanzees the TPOR was published to be essential for exerting pharmacological action of eltrombopag 
(Erickson-Miller et al. 2004). This molecular feature was confirmed with butyzamide, a compound with 
high structural similarity to lusutrombicopag in cell lines transfected with the respective amino acid 
substitutions of the human or murine TPOR: Ba/F3-hMplH499L (His substituted by Leu) and 
Ba/F3-mMplL499H (Leu substituted with His) (Nogami et al. 2008). 
Daily oral treatment of TPOR-Ki/Shi mice with lusutrombopag for 21-days showed dose-dependent 
increase in platelet count at ≥ 0.3 mg/kg/d from day 7 to day 22 if compared to the control group. PK/PD 
analysis showed correlation for platelet increase with AUC0-inf and Cmax in the model. 
Regarding extrapolation of data, Cmax and AUC0-inf values (at the time when platelet counts increased 
by 50%) in humans and TPOR-Ki/Shi mice were largely comparable with 0.062 µg/ml Cmax and 0.639 
µg.hr/ml in TPOR-Ki/Shi mice and 0.0389 µg/mL Cmax and 0.703 µg.hr/mL AUC0-inf in healthy adults 
(0.5 mg dose group). 
A 6 weeks study showed consistent platelet counts after d29 at the highest (3 mg/kg/d) dose group, 
which is taken as an indicator that also clinically a continued increase in platelet count unlikely occurs with 
prolonged administration. 
Another in vivo PD study in the same model (oral, daily, 21-days) showed megakaryocytopoiesis in the 
bone marrow and the spleen, consistent with increasing platelet counts – thus indicating TPOR driven 
upregulation and proliferation of megakaryocytic cells, responsible for increased platelet counts. 
Comparable PD effects were observed in a parallel, eltrombopag exposed study group. Both high dose 
groups showed small decreases in RBC count, HGB concentration and HCT – not affecting any changes in 
the coagulation tests. 
As thrombocytopenia is one of the manifestations in MDS, lusutrombopag was investigated in 
combination with EPO or G-CSF. The compound showed in a CFU assay in human bone marrow-derived 
CD34 positive cells no effect on the EPO or G-CSF induced hematopoietic colony formation. 
A panel of 11 enzymes and 30 receptors was used to evaluate for inhibitory activities of lusutrombopag, 
identifying COX-1, COX-2, PDE1, adrenergic α2C and BLT (LTB4). IC50 values for these interactions were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 19/142 
 
 
 
far above clinical Cmax values, providing a margin around 5100 to the plasma concentration of unbound 
unchanged lusutrombopag. Thus no or little effect on enzymes, ion channels and other receptors than 
TPOR can be expected. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The effect of lusutrombopag (concentration: 0.25 and 1 μmol/L) on recombinant human EPO (rhEPO)- 
and human G-CSF (rhG-CSF)-induced hematopoietic colony formation was evaluated. Human bone 
marrow-derived CD34 positive cells were incubated with lusutrombopag only or together with rhEPO 
(concentration: 0.05 and 3 U/mL). In addition, human bone marrow-derived CD34 positive cells were 
incubated with lusutrombopag alone or together with rhG-CSF (concentration: 1 and 10 ng/mL). 
Lusutrombopag did not induce differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells to erythroid cells and 
granulocytic/macrophage cells, except for megakaryocytes. Therefore, it was demonstrated that 
lusutrombopag has no effect on hematopoietic colony-forming activities of EPO and G-CSF (Report 
S-888711-EB-159-N). 
A total of 11 enzyme assays and 30 receptor binding assays were evaluated at 10 μmol/L. When inhibitory 
activities (≥ 50% inhibition) were noted, 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values were determined. 
The IC50 of adrenergic α2C, leukotriene B4, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, and phosphodiesterase 1 
were calculated as 2.75, 2.78, 16.2, 4.08, and 1.36 μmol/L, respectively. Lusutrombopag had no effect on 
other receptors and enzymes at a concentration of 10 μmol/L.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Core battery safety pharmacology studies of lusutrombopag were performed to investigate effects on the 
central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory system in rats and the cardiovascular system in vitro and 
in dogs. Two follow-up studies were performed to further investigate effects on the cardiovascular system 
in dogs. 
Lusutrombopag had no significant effects on general physical behaviour and neurobehavioral function at 
any doses, suggesting that lusutrombopag at a dose up to 1000 mg/kg had no effect on the CNS system 
in rats. No lusutrombopag-related changes were noted on ECG parameter. It was concluded that the 
second-degree AV block and PR prolongation observed in the 1-month oral repeat-dose toxicity study 
were due to vehicle (PEG/Tween 80), and lusutrombopag had no effect on the cardiovascular system in 
dogs. There was no effect of lusutrombopag on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters at any 
doses, suggesting that lusutrombopag at doses up to 500 mg/kg had no effect on the cardiovascular 
system. There was no effect of lusutrombopag on respiration rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation 
volume at any dose, suggesting that lusutrombopag at a dose up to 1000 mg/kg had no effect on the 
respiratory system in rat.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
With the exception of studies which assessed the effect of lusutrombopag on rhEPO- and 
rhG-CSF-induced hematopoietic colony formation, no studies investigating pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic studies of lusutrombopag were conducted with mice, rats, 
rabbits, and dogs, which were used for the pharmacology studies and/or the toxicity studies. The 
distribution of radioactivity in melanin-containing tissues in pigmented rats was investigated by 
quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA). The excretion of radioactivity into milk in nursing rats 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 20/142 
 
 
 
was investigated. The 14C-radiolabeled lusutrombopag ([14C]-lusutrombopag) was used in the PK 
studies where radioactivity was used. In vitro studies were performed to investigate the 
inhibition/induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and inhibition of transporters by lusutrombopag, 
as well as to identify responsible metabolising enzymes and transporters for the pharmacokinetics of 
lusutrombopag. 
After oral administration of lusutrombopag to non-fasting rats and dogs, plasma concentrations increased 
in a dose-dependent manner. Fasting before administration did not impact absorption. Bioavailability in 
fasting rats was between 45-52%. Using 0.5% methylcellulose suspension as a vehicle instead of 
PEG400, both Cmax and AUC did not increase in a dose proportional manner at high dose (10 mg/kg), 
suggesting earlier saturation when using methylcellulose as vehicle. 
Since the ratio of (+)-S-888711 to S-888711 in plasma sample was similar to that in the test substance 
in all tested species, it was demonstrated that chiral inversion from S-888711 to (+)-S-888711 does not 
occur in vivo in mice, rats and dogs. 
For both RSC-888711 and (+)-RSC-888711 in both sexes, the Cmax and AUC0-24hr values increased 
dose proportionally between the lower and medium dose groups, and increased less than dose 
proportionally or even decreased in medium and high dose groups, respectively. In contrast to mice, 
repeated-dosing of lusutrombopag resulted in increases in Cmax and AUC0-24hr in the toxicokinetic 
studies conducted in rats and rabbits. 
Quantitative whole body autoradiography after single oral administration of 3 mg/kg to male and female 
albino rats revealed similar tissue distribution of lusutrombopag to almost all tissues in both sexes. Most 
of the tissue reached the peak levels between 8 (males) and 8-12 hours (females) with the liver and the 
adrenal cortex showing highest radioactivity. Studies in male pigmented rats resulted in similar findings 
indicating no evidence for drug-binding to melanin-containing tissues. 
After oral administration of radiolabelled-lusutrombopag to pregnant rats, highest tissue concentrations 
of radioactivity were detected in adrenal gland and liver 8 hours after administration. Moreover, 
radioactivity was also detected in fetus indicating placental transfer of lusutrombopag. 
Protein binding was found to be very high (>99%) within in vitro assays conducted with plasma from 
mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and male human volunteers. Distribution of radioactivity to blood cells was found 
to be low in all species tested. These findings suggest that there are no species differences in plasma 
protein binding and distribution to blood cells. 
The major component of radioactivity in plasma of mice, rat and rabbit was unchanged lusutrombopag. 
Deshexyl, β-oxidated carboxylic acid, and 5-keto were identified to be major metabolites. These results 
indicate that major metabolites detected in human plasma exist also in plasma of the tested animals. 
Other metabolites occurred at lower concentrations. The results suggest that lusutrombopag is mainly 
metabolised via oxidation of the hexyl group of the RSC-888711 side chain. 
The major metabolites occurring in urine, faeces and bile were also investigated in rats, mice and dogs, 
with unchanged lusutrombopag again representing the major amount of radioactivity measured. 
Approximately 98% of the administered dose was excreted in the faeces after oral administration of 
[14C]-lusutrombopag. 23.7% of the radioactivity detected was excreted via bile into faeces. After 
repeated oral dosing for 14 days a main excretion route was the faeces and similar amount of excreted 
cumulative radioactivity (98.2%) was detected as after single administration. Some of the reabsorbed 
radioactive components were excreted into the bile again, indicating enterohepatic circulation. 
After single oral administration of [14C]-S-888711 at 3 mg/kg to nursing rats, the radioactivity was 
excreted into milk. Forty-eight hours after administration, the milk concentration of radioactivity 
decreased to about 10% of the maximum concentration.

To evaluate the effects of lusutrombopag on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes two GLP compliant 
studies were conducted in rat and dog, respectively. Dose-related increases in microsomal protein 
content were associated with lusutrombopag treatment in male rats without complete recovery. In dogs, 
the only significant finding was a slight, dose-dependent increase of the T16α-OHase activity, a marker 
activity for CYP2B11/2C21. All of the alterations found in dogs were fully reversible. 
Lusutrombopag was shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. This signal was followed up on the clinical 
level. 
Further, specific marker activities and the binding site of lusutrombopag on human serum albumin were 
investigated using human hepatocytes. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Key toxicology studies, which include single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies, in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity  studies,  carcinogenicity  studies,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies,  local 
tolerance studies, a skin phototoxicity study, were conducted for lusutrombopag, and in  vitro  reverse 
mutation  assays  were  also  conducted  for  possible  impurities  of  lusutrombopag.  Standard  species  for 
nonclinical  safety  evaluation  of  pharmaceuticals  (mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs)  were  used  for  these 
studies. As lusutrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in normal (non-genetically engineered) 
laboratory animals because of its human TPO receptor specificity, the data from these animals do not fully 
model the effects of lusutrombopag in humans derived from its pharmacological effects. Accordingly, to 
assess on-target effects of lusutrombopag on the bone marrow, especially the potential risk of fibrosis in 
humans, a potential to evoke bone marrow fibrosis was assessed using TPOR-Ki/Shi mice. Long-term 
repeat-dose toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies were conducted to address possible indications 
requiring long-term treatment of thrombocytopenia with lusutrombopag. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single oral dose toxicity study was conducted in rats (5 animals/sex/group) and dogs (1 
animal/sex/group) with up to 2000 mg/kg. As no deaths occurred throughout the study period the lethal 
dose was determined to be >2000 mg/kg for rats and dogs. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
All relevant repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with current GLP guidance. 
The principal toxicity findings associated with lusutrombopag treatment included prolongation of PT and 
APTT (rats), increased activities of plasma ALT, AST and ALP (rats and dogs), adrenal toxicity (rats and 
dogs), skin and forestomach lesions (rats), renal toxicity (rats) and minor findings in the gallbladder of 
dogs. Changes in the adrenal or gallbladder completely or at least partially recovered at the end of the 
withdrawal period. 
Lusutrombopag showed no toxicity in rats at a dose up to 8 mg/kg/day or in dogs at a dose up to 3 
mg/kg/day after 1-month of dosing. There were no significant sex differences in the incidence of 
lusutrombopag-related lesions, and no exacerbation or significant increase in the incidence of effects with 
treatment for longer than 1 month. All changes showed reversibility or a tendency towards reversibility 
after 1-month drug-withdrawal. 
Within the three month dog study 0.5% methylcellulose was used as the vehicle instead of polyethylene 
glycol 400 with 5 w/w% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (PEG/Tw 80) which was used in the 
previous 1-month study. Compared to the one-month study, second-degree AV block was not detected in 
any of the treated groups up to 600 mg/kg/day. The effects on ECG parameters seem to be associated to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 22/142 
 
 
 
PEG/Tw 80 rather than the drug substance itself. With regard to the three-month study the NOAEL was 
considered to be 10 mg/kg/day for males and 80 mg/kg/day for females. 
Genotoxicity 
Three GLP compliant genotoxicity studies were conducted in bacteria and mammalian cells. Negative 
results were observed in the reverse mutation test with bacteria as well as in the chromosomal aberration 
test in cultured mammalian cells and the micronucleus test with mouse bone marrow cells.  
Carcinogenicity 
Two GLP compliant long-term carcinogenicity studies (104 weeks) in mice and rats, respectively, were 
conducted. Neither in mice nor in rats were any neoplastic changes or evidence for carcinogenic potential 
of lusutrombopag observed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Four GLP compliant studies in rats and rabbits were conducted to assess the potential of lusutrombopag 
for reproductive and developmental toxicity. Additional four studies (two of them in compliance with GLP) 
were conducted for dose range finding purposes. 
In the rat study on fertility and early embryonic development no effects on male or female fertility was 
found up to the highest dose (100mg/kg/day) tested. Exfoliation of the limbs was found in all studies 
conducted in rats. In F1 rat pups, adverse effects were found in the high dose group. These findings 
included low viability index, low body weight, low score of negative geotaxis, delayed eyelid opening, 
prominent annular rings, slightly low fertility index in F1 females and slightly low numbers of corpora lutea 
and implantations, and a tendency to high pre-implantation loss rate. Moreover, transient test 
substance-related increase in frequency of short supernumerary rib, which was classified as skeletal 
variation of isolated nature, was observed in culled pups after birth from the 12.5 mg/kg group upwards 
in the rat EFD study. Thus, the NOAEL in this study was determined to be 12.5 mg/kg/day. 
In rats, treatment-related non-neoplastic changes were confined to the ovaries of S-888711 treated 
females consisting of granulosa cell hyperplasia. Other changes consisted of marginally lower α2 globulin 
for males at 6 mg/kg/day and above and an increased incidence of dark adrenals noted macroscopically 
for males at 6 mg/kg/day and above and females at 1 mg/kg/day and above. No histopathological 
findings could be correlated with the increased incidence of dark adrenals and neither histopathological 
nor clinical findings were associated with decreased α2 globulin concentrations in male rats. 
Lusutrombopag up to 80 or 1000 mg/kg/day showed no teratogenicity in rats or rabbits, respectively. 
However, adverse effects were detected on fetal intrauterine growth and skeletal morphology in rats. No 
effects of lusutrombopag on viability, intrauterine growth, and skeletal morphology were noted in rabbits 
treated up to 1000 mg/kg/day. 
Local Tolerance  
Lusutrombopag (0.5 g/site) was applied to the skin of New Zealand White rabbits by occlusive application 
to  investigate  its  potential  of  dermal  irritation.  The  skin  reaction  was  evaluated  in  accordance  with 
Draize’s criteria. Lusutrombopag has no potential of dermal irritation on rabbit skin.

Lusutrombopag  (0.1  g/left  eye)  was  applied  to  the  conjunctival  sac  of  New  Zealand  White  rabbits  to 
investigate its potential of ocular irritation. The ocular reaction in the eye was evaluated in accordance 
with Draize’s criteria. Lusutrombopag has no potential of ocular irritation on rabbit eye. 
Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities 
Five impurities, were shown to be positive in the Ames test. All of these potentially mutagenic impurities 
were shown to be present at levels below the acceptable limit of either not more than 0.5% (respectively 
the TTC) according to ICH M7 or were not detectable at all. The assessment of these impurities is 
acceptable with regard to current guidance and thus, the need for setting specification limits is not given 
for these five potentially mutagenic impurities.

Lusutrombopag’s PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. As the logDow exceeds the 
action limit of 4.5, formal PBT testing is needed. 
The active ingredient lusutrombopag has to be classified as very persistent (vP, DT50sediment >180d) in 
the environment according to the half-lives in sediment derived in the present study on transformation in 
water/sediment systems (OECD 308). Results from bioaccumulation studies in rainbow trout revealed a 
BCF of >5000. Accordingly, lusutrombopag was categorised to be very bioaccumulative (vB) (OECD 305). 
Subsequent aquatic toxicity testing showed a NOEC for algae above 0.01 mg/L. 
Thus, lusutrombopag has to be categorised as very persistent, very bioaccumulative and toxic (vPvBT). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lusutrombopag presents the S-enantiomer of an orally administered, novel small-molecule human TPO 
receptor agonist, inducing platelet production by triggering proliferation and differentiation of 
megakaryocyte progenitor cells via 2 signalling pathways (JAK-STAT pathway and Ras-p44/42 MAPK 
pathway).  
The (+)-lusutrombopag form is specified as an impurity and shows pharmacological activity and 
lusutrombopag is not chirally transformed in vivo. The applicant clarified that the selected S-enantiomer 
showed a higher increase in platelets in rats and absence of inducing any hepatic metabolizing enzyme in 
rats. A preliminary 2-week toxicity study in rats showed no differences in toxic findings between both 
enantiomers.  
Pharmacological activity of lusutrombopag was evaluated non-clinically in direct comparison to 
eltrombopag and/or recombinant hTPO: Proliferative activity of lusutrombopag was shown on the in vitro 
level in Ba/F3-hMpl cells expressing the human TPO receptor, but no proliferation was observed in 
non-transfected (TPO receptor negative) Ba/F3 cells. 
The absence of receptor binding of lusutrombopag against human EPO, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 
receptors was confirmed by measuring proliferative effect on the respective cytokine-dependent cell lines 
(Ba/F3-hEPOR cells, NOMO-1 cells, and TF-1 cell). No data on the evaluation of lusutrombopag for 
receptor binding to IFN-alfa and IFN-gamma receptors were provided. This was justified based on data 
showing that the binding site and mechanism of action of lusutrombopag and eltrombopag are the same, 
hence there is sufficient evidence that both products can bind to the receptors. This is considered 
acceptable. 
The signal transduction pathway of lusutrombopag in comparison to TPO was investigated on Ba/F3-hMpl 
cells, and showed phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, and p44/42 MAPK for both. The outcome of in 
vitro studies by stimulation of Ba/F3-hMpl cells indicates a comparable mechanism of action. 
Lusutrombopag acts additively with TPO: although no in vitro combination studies with TPO and 
lusutrombopag were conducted, evidence for additivity is provided based on data from proliferation and 
activation assays in N2C-Tpo cells with eltrombopag and TPO. Above that different binding sites for TPO 
and eltrombopag indicate the absence of binding competition.

Overall, the in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies performed in rats and dogs indicated no 
adverse effects on CNS and respiratory system. Cardiovascular effects (AV block) were observed in a few 
animals of an initial CV study in dogs, but later on confirmed to be unrelated to lusutrombopag but caused 
by PEG/Tween 80 used as a vehicle. Thus in summary, no findings from safety pharmacology studies were 
detected with animal to human exposure ratios ranging from 48 to 222 for the in vivo studies. 
The Applicant performed an extensive set of non-clinical studies in relevant rodent and non-rodent 
species and in agreement with recent guidelines to evaluate the toxicological profile of lusutrombopag. No 
findings on the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of lusutrombopag were observed. Treatment-related 
non-neoplastic granulosa cell hyperplasia in the ovaries of female rats was observed histopathologically, 
however, not considered to be adverse because there were no effects found in other hormone-related 
tissues. Macroscopic findings of dark adrenals in male and female rats could not be correlated with any 
histopathological findings. The observed increase in the mortality rate of treated female rats was not 
considered significant and occurred only after long-term treatment and at much higher doses than the 
proposed human dose. 
Treatment-related toxicity findings in single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were all 
reversible and NOAELs showed sufficient safety margins when compared to the proposed human dose of 
3 mg/day. 
Lusutrombopag up to 80 or 1000 mg/kg/day showed no teratogenicity in rats or rabbits, respectively. No 
effects of lusutrombopag on viability, intrauterine growth, and skeletal morphology were noted in rabbits 
treated up to 1000 mg/kg/day. 
However, adverse effects were detected on fetal intrauterine growth and skeletal morphology in rats. 
Exfoliation of the limbs was found in all studies conducted in rats. In F1 rat pups, adverse effects were 
found in the high dose group. These findings included low viability index, low body weight, low score of 
negative geotaxis, delayed eyelid opening, prominent annular rings, slightly low fertility index in F1 
females and slightly low number of corpora lutea and implantations, and a tendency to high 
pre-implantation loss rate. Moreover, transient test substance-related increase in frequency of short 
supernumerary rib, which was classified as skeletal variation of isolated nature, was observed in culled 
pups after birth from the 12.5 mg/kg group upwards in the rat EFD study. These findings are reflected in 
the sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC, where it is stated that lusutrombopag should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the expected benefit outweighs the expected risk. 
Fibrosis of the bone marrow may occur as an exaggerated on-target effect of lusutrombopag at high dose 
long-term treatment. This is accordingly mentioned in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Lusutrombopag was shown to be very persistent (vP), very bioaccumulative (vB) and toxic (T). 
Appropriate statements have been included in the SmPC.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted for lusutrombopag support the approval of lusutrombopag. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
Lusutrombopag has shown to be vP and vB. The applicant is asked to provide chronic aquatic studies for 
T assessment, to allow a final conclusion on PBT evaluation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 21 studies, 4 of which were biopharmaceutic studies contributed PK and/or PD data. The clinical 
pharmacology program was devised to characterise the PK, potential for drug interactions and mass 
balance of lusutrombopag in healthy adult subjects and to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
PK of lusutrombopag.  
Both solution and tablet formulations of lusutrombopag for oral administration were used in the clinical 
development program. The applicant claims linear PK of lusutrombopag and therefore the possibility to 
extrapolate the results of the different formulations used in the different studies to the 3-mg tablet 
intended for marketing. PK linearity of the various tablet formulations used in the clinical trials wasshown 
by providing a comparison of the individual and mean dose adjusted AUC values at 3mg in a tabulated 
manner and as a graphical illustration. Sufficient comparability is therefore given which supports the 
claim for dose proportionality and PK linearity in the clinically relevant dosage strength. 
Doses of 0.1 to 50 mg were administered as oral solutions in some initial Phase 1 studies using a constant 
volume for preparation. Tablet strengths in order of use in clinical studies were 2, 10, 0.1, 0.25, 1, 4, and 
3 mg. The lusutrombopag formulation intended for marketing is the 3-mg tablet.  
Analytical methods 
The validations provided for the analytical methods to determine Lusutrombopag in human plasma and 
human urine are in accordance to the relevant guidelines. The analytical methods were validated across 
the calibration range with respect to selectivity, accuracy, precision, and stability under a variety of 
conditions. Plasma samples and urine samples for determination of lusutrombopag and metabolite 
concentrations were prepared by the protein precipitation method and analyzed by the liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. Standard methods were applied.  
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
In single dose studies conducted in healthy subjects, doses of 0.1 to 0.50 mg were administered. The 
median Tmax values ranged from 3.5 to 6 hours post-dose.  
In multiple dose studies conducted in healthy subjects, doses from 0.25 to 2mg were administered. The 
median Tmax values ranged from 4 to 8 hours (day 7 or day 14) after ingestion.  
In multiple dose studies conducted in subjects with CLD doses were between 0.25 to 2mg (study M0623) 
and 2.5 to 4mg (study M0625). The median Tmax values ranged from 6 to 8 hours. 
When looking at the Cmax and AUC values throughout the studies conducted, a dose proportional 
increase could be observed in both, healthy and thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD. In Study M0613 
(Multiple dose in healthy subjects) and Study M0617 (DDI Study with Midazolam) steady state was 
achieved by day 5 and in study M0615 (multiple dose in healthy subjects) at day 7. 
Study M0634 was conducted across multiple regions, with a mixed non-Japanese population to allow 
meaningful comparison by race/ethnicity and included subjects in North America, Europe, Asia, and the 
Rest of World. This allows for comparison of the PK results to the Japanese population. The median Tmax 
was 5.95 hours. 
It is noted that when looking at the individual plasma concentration PK profiles, inter-individual variability 
could be observed. Furthermore the Cmax and AUC0-t were lower when compared to other studies 
conducted with lusutrombopag 3 mg. The applicant attributes both to the higher body weight in this study 
compared to other studies conducted in the Japanese Population (the applicant compared the mean body

weight of this study (intense PK group) [range]: 86.9 [57.1 to 123.4] kg) to studies M061B (56.3 [45.6 
to 74.9] and M0633 63.8 [39.5 to 86.5] kg). The mentioned observations may be attributed to differences 
in body weight. Genetic polymorphism is most likely not to play a major role behind the above mentioned 
observed differences. From the data available no definite difference in metabolism between ethnicities is 
clearly evident. The observed differences in exposure seem to be mainly driven by differences in 
bodyweight in the Japanese and Caucasian population, as also observed in the pop PK model where 
bodyweight was identified as an influential covariate on PK. 
As for Eltrombopag where differences between East Asian and non-East Asian were observed, it has to be 
noted that the metabolisation pathways differ in comparison to lusutrombopag. No evidence for 
pharmacogenomic implication on PK could be identified from the dataset provided. 
As already discussed, Lusutrombopag is metabolised mainly by CYP4 enzymes, including CYP4A11. It is 
worth noting that the CYP4A11 play an important role in regulation of blood pressure through the 
conversion of arachidonic acid into 20-HETE and its polymorphism may be an important risk factor for 
hypertension, coronary artery disease or cerebral infarction. Bearing in mind that the main metabolic 
route of lusutrombopag is related to CYP4A11, its polymorphism may change the exposure to 
lusutrombopag.  CYP4A11 polymorphism is not considered to have a significant effect on metabolism of 
lusutrombopag. CYP4A11 can increase the AUC in poor metabolizers, but the fold increase in exposure is 
considered to be less than 2, at even maximum risk evaluation. Bearing in mind that there is a possibility 
that alternative metabolic pathways may be activated for poor metabolizers, the AUC in poor 
metabolizers might not change compared with that in extensive metabolisers. 
The absolute oral bioavailability of lusutrombopag after administration to humans has not been 
established. The relative bioavailability of the 0.25-mg tablet used in Phase 2 Studies M0623 and M0625 
to lusutrombopag solution was 88.1%, 81.7%, and 82.0% for Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf, respectively.  
The relative bioavailability of the 2-mg tablet used in Phase 2 Study M0625 to lusutrombopag solution was 
89.0%, 92.9%, and 93.1% for Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf, respectively. 
The following figure shows the plasma concentration time course profile for study M0634, which was 
conducted across multiple regions, with a mixed non-Japanese population in patients with chronic liver 
disease undergoing elective invasive procedures.

Bioequivalence 
Both, solutions and various tablet formulations of lusutrombopag for oral administration were used in the 
clinical development program. For the subsequent Phase 2b dose-finding Study M0626 in which doses of 
2, 3, and 4 mg were evaluated, a tablet strength of 1 mg was required (with doses being achieved by 
intake of multiple 1-mg tablets). This 1-mg tablet was formulated to be similar to the tablets used in 
early-stage clinical studies. However, to improve stability of these first-generation tablets, a 
second-generation tablet formulation was developed and produced in 4-mg and 3-mg strengths. The 
4-mg and 3-mg tablets contained active ingredient and excipients in the same proportions. The 4-mg and 
3-mg tablets were demonstrated to have comparable dissolution profiles, and thus an in vivo 
bioequivalence study was not conducted.

Figure 4: overview of investigation of bioavailability of the lusutromboapg tablet formulation 
to be marked 
The relative bioavailability of oral solution and tablet formulations was investigated at doses of 0.1 to 10 
mg in 3 biopharmaceutic studies (Studies M0612, M0614, and M061A). All were open-label, single-dose, 
cross-over studies. 
No notable difference with regards to relevant PK parameters between the oral solutions and tablet 
formulations used were identified. The Cmax and AUC values seem to increased dose-proportionally 
indicating PK linearity over the various dosage strengths used. Dose proportionality and PK linearity in the 
clinically relevant dosage strength have been established.  
For the Phase 2b final dose-finding Study M0626 in which doses of 2, 3, and 4 mg were evaluated, a tablet 
strength of 1 mg was required (with doses being achieved by intake of multiple 1-mg tablets). This 1-mg 
tablet was formulated to be similar to the tablets used in early-stage clinical studies.  
When comparing the 1mg strength used in the Phase 2b dose finding study M0626 and the 4mg tablet 
used in study M061A, the Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were lower after administration of the 4-mg tablet 
than those after administration of 4 × 1-mg tablets when given to subjects in the fasting state. However, 
the ratios of geometric least squares mean Cmax and AUC0-inf of 4-mg tablet to 1-mg tablet in the fasted 
state were both approximately 0.9 and the corresponding 90% CIs were within the predefined 
bioequivalence criteria of 80% to 125%. In conclusion, in Study M061A the Bioavailability of the 4 x 1mg 
tablets was comparable to that of 1 x 4 mg in Japanese subjects and the criterion set up to prove 
Bioequivalence were met indicating that the bioavailability of 4-mg tablet was comparable to that of 1-mg 
tablet.  
To improve stability of these first-generation tablets, a second-generation tablet formulation was 
developed and produced in 4-mg and 3-mg strengths. The 4-mg and 3-mg tablets contained active 
ingredient and excipients in the same proportions.  
The 4mg strength was used in study M061A, the 3mg strength in study M0631 (Phase 3 confirmatory 
study in Japan). For the Global Phase 3 study (M0634) the manufacturing site was changed. Based on the 
linear PK of lusutrombopag, the comparability between the 4mg and the 3mg strength, and the 3mg 
strengths from different manufacturing sites was based on in vitro dissolution profiles waiving additional 
in vivo bioequivalence testing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 40/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 3-mg drug product for commercialisation (and 4-mg tablet used in Study M061A) was designed so 
that the tablets had a proportionally similar composition as the 2-mg formulation batch. The various 2mg 
tablet strengths underwent dissolution profile testing indicating comparable dissolution behaviour. This 
selection is not comprehensible as there is no obvious effect on solubility due to the surfactants used.  
Influence of Food 
For all relevant studies investigating food effect, the ratio for the geometric last squares mean can be 
deemed comparable with regards to Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. Therefore, comparable plasma exposure 
of lusutrombopag can be concluded. 
For study M0612 the Cmax and AUC in the fed state were lower than those in the fasted state (GLS mean 
ratios (90% CI) (fed versus fasted) for Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were 0.904 (0.864 to 0.945), 0.921 
(0.887 to 0.956), and 0.920 (0.886 to 0.956)). However the differences were rather negligible and the 
corresponding 90% CIs were within the predefined bioequivalence criteria of 80% to 125%. Food only 
had a small effect on the PK of lusutrombopag at a dose of 2 mg. 
The analysis of PK parameters of lusutrombopag after administration of a single 2-mg dose of 
lusutrombopag in the fed state in healthy adult Japanese male subjects (Study M0612) and in healthy 
white adult male subjects living in Japan (Study M0614) showed that the plasma concentration-time 
profiles after administration of single doses of lusutrombopag 2 mg were similar. In the ANOVA, t1/2,z 
tended to be longer in white subjects than Japanese subjects, but other PK parameters showed no 
statistically significant difference. PK results were comparable between the non-Japanese subjects living 
in Japan and elsewhere, taking into account the different doses used in the various studies conducted. For 
study M061A, the ratios of geometric least squares mean Cmax and AUC0-inf of 4-mg tablet in the fed state 
to those in the fasted state were both approximately 0.9 and the corresponding 90% CIs were within the 
predefined bioequivalence criteria of 80% to 125%, indicating that food intake had no effect on the PK of 
4-mg tablet. It can therefore be concluded that no influence of food was observed on the relative 
bioavailability of the 4-mg tablet, the composition of which is quantitatively proportional to the 3-mg 
tablet intended for marketing. In the study protocol M061A no statistical testing for Tmax was 
established. However, Tmax for the fed condition was comparable to that for the fasted condition. 
The relevant PK parameters in study M0618 were comparable between subjects with or without calcium 
intake and the ratios for B/A were approximately near 1 and the corresponding 90% CIs were within the 
predefined bioequivalence criteria of 80% to 125%. Therefore it can be concluded that the 
co-administration with 4000mg of calcium did not significantly affect the PK of 0.75mg single dose of 
lusutrombopag administered in healthy subjects. The findings also suggest no influence of multivalent 
cations contained in antacids, mineral supplements, dairy products, etc. on the PK of lusutrombopag. The 
same applies for high-fat and high-calorie meal. 
Overall it can be concluded that the influence of high-fat, high-calorie meal and calcium on the PK and BA 
of lusutrombopag is only minimal and very likely clinically not meaningful.  
Distribution 
The PK parameters of radioactivity and S-888711 were well characterised in the mass balance study 
M0619. In blood, [14C]-lusutrombopag was distributed mainly in the plasma.   
The total radioactivity concentrations of lusutrombopag in whole blood were 52.9% to 56.9% of plasma 
radioactivity concentrations. The volume percentage of plasma in whole blood was approximately 55%. 
In this context in study M061E, it could be observed, that the geometric mean (% CV) apparent volume 
of distribution during the terminal phase of lusutrombopag in healthy adult subjects was 39.5 L (23.5%) 
after the administration of a 3mg tablet in 16 subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 41/142 
 
 
 
The distribution of radioactivity into blood cells was observed to be minimal, with essentially no binding to 
the red blood cells as indicated in the individual and descriptive statistics for distribution (%) of 
radioactivity in red blood cells. The whole blood/plasma radioactivity exposure ratios were close to the 
ratio of plasma/whole blood volume. Taken together, it could be concluded that the amount of 
radioactivity in blood was approximately equal to the amount in plasma and [14C]-S-888711 is therefore 
primarily distributed in plasma. 
Lusutrombopag was shown to be highly bound to human plasma proteins, with a high binding ratio of 
99.996% or more at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 µg/mL (Study R-888711-PF-057-N). A change 
in protein binding may cause a clinically important change in the relationship between total and 
unconjugated concentrations of the drug (Fu). This is particularly important bearing in mind that a very 
limited number of Child-Pugh class C patients took part in pivotal studies and that there were few patients 
with severe hypoalbuminaemia (<28g/l) in the patient population undergoing the studies. PK parameters 
appeared to be comparable between patients with and without severe hypoalbuminemia. 
Elimination 
The primary route of excretion of Lusutrombopag is via the feces. The terminal elimination half-life t1/2,z 
was: 
•  19.3 to 29.5 hours (geometric mean) in single dose studies in healthy subjects 
•  27.0 to 32.0 hours in multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects 
•  31.9 to 43.9 hours in multiple-dose studies in subjects with CLD  
Approximately 83% was excreted into feces, approximately 1% into urine. 
Metabolism 
In the mass balance study (M0619), which used [14C]-lusutrombopag, the metabolism of lusutrombopag 
was well characterised. Approximately 97% of plasma radioactivity was detected as unchanged 
lusutrombopag. The metabolites (deshexyl, β oxidated carboxylic acid, taurine conjugate of β-oxidated 
carboxylic acid, and acyl-glucuronide) were only detected at a trace level (each constituting ≤ 2.6% of 
plasma radioactivity). Metabolite profiling in the mass balance study suggested that lusutrombopag may 
be primarily metabolised by oxidation of the hexyl group followed by β-oxidation of O-hexyl side chain in 
the liver. According to the guideline, preferably total recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces should 
exceed 90% of the dose with over 80% of the recovered radioactivity being identified. In the mass 
balance study (Study M0619), a small proportion of total radioactivity was excreted into the faeces on the 
last sampling day (Day 15), suggesting further recovery of radioactivity from the faeces after Day 15. 
The main elimination pathway is via the feces were unchanged lusutrombopag was detected as 16.22% 
of administered radioactivity, and a mixture of deshexyl and O-propanol (or O-acetic acid) metabolites 
was detected as 17.93% of administered radioactivity.  
In vitro studies revealed that CYP4 enzymes including CYP4A11 and partially CYP3A4 enzyme were 
contributed to ω-oxidation to form 6-hydroxylated lusutrombopag. Furthermore, lusutrombopag was 
shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1 based on 
in vitro results. Results from the clinical DDI study M061E indeed indicate that P-gp and BCRP inhibition 
modestly increases lusutrombopag plasma. The cut off values for criteria (as by the mentioned guideline) 
were net exceeded for OATB1B1. Thus, in vivo inhibition is not expected. PK of metabolites was not 
specifically investigated in a human study, but in the mass balance study M0619, the ratio for Cmax of 
deshexyl relative to radioactivity in plasma was below 1%. The concentration of 5-keto derivative was

BLQ. These findings suggested the presence of a large number of undetectable, trace amounts of 
metabolites in plasma.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study M0634 (Phase 3 Study in Thrombocytopenic Subjects with Chronic Liver Disease) the Cmax and 
AUC0-τ exhibited moderate interindividual variability which seem to be related to the variability in body 
weight.  
When comparing relevant PK parameters between healthy Japanese subjects and subjects with CLD 
(study M0613 and Study M0623) it could be observed, that variability of Cmax and AUC0-t seems to be 
higher in subjects with CLD. 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
The applicant provided a comparison of relevant PK parameters between healthy Japanese subjects and 
subjects with CLD. Overall, the PK parameters seem to be comparable to some extend with no major 
differences. However, as can be seen in Figure 31 and Table 3 below, the variability of Cmax and AUC0-t 
seems to be higher in subjects with CLD.

Study M0631 was a multicentre placebo-controlled study which also evaluated the PK of lusutrombopag 
in Japanese thrombocytopenic subjects (those with a platelet count of < 50,000/μL) with CLD after 
multiple oral doses. Only the evaluation of plasma concentration was a secondary objective in this study. 
Individual plasma S-888711 concentrations were listed and summarised for patients with completion of 
5- to 7-day administration by dose group and nominal time (prior to administration on Day 5, 6 to 8 hours 
after the administration on Day 7, and 24, 48, and 72 hours after the last administration). The collection 
of blood samples for determination of plasma concentration differed depending on the duration of drug 
administration. Overall, when looking at the Plasma concentration of lusutrombopag comparability to the 
results of study M0626 could be observed.  
Study M0633 was an open-label Phase 3 study evaluated the PK of a 3-mg dose of lusutrombopag 
administered once daily for up to 7 days in Japanese subjects with CLD and who were Child-Pugh class A 
or B and also evaluated differences in PK between subjects who had previously received lusutrombopag 
and subjects who were treatment-naïve was evaluated in this multiple-dose study. 
When looking at the plasma concentration profiles of S-888711comparabilty between the naive and 
non-naive patients could be observed. The geometric least squares mean ratios of Cmax and AUC0-τ were 
1.06 (90% CI: 0.86 to 1.32) and 1.11 (90% CI: 0.89 to 1.38), respectively which indicates comparable 
exposure. Comparability could also be observed with regards to CL/F. With regards to the terminal 
elimination rate constant λz and the terminal elimination half-life (t½,z) statistically significant 
differences could be observed. the geometric mean values of t1/2,z for the naive and non-naive patients 
were 37.7 and 43.9 hours. A clinical impact is therefore rather unlikely. 
The plasma concentrations of lusutrombopag were similar between Child-Pugh class A and B subjects (as 
can be seen in Figure 16). The GLS mean ratios of Cmax and AUC0-τ were 0.90 (90% CI: 0.71 to 1.15) and 
1.00 (90% CI: 0.76 to 1.33), respectively which indicates comparable exposure with only slight 
numerically differences. Comparability could also be observed for the other relevant PK parameters. 
Study M0634 was a phase 3 study which was conducted across multiple regions, with a mixed 
non-Japanese population to allow meaningful comparison by race/ethnicity and included subjects in North 
America, Europe, Asia, and the Rest of World. This allows for comparison of the PK results to the Japanese 
population 
A total of 63 concentrations were obtained from 9 subjects in the intensive sampling group. Of 63 
concentrations, 11 samples were out of allowance windows of blood samplings for the intensive sampling 
group, but they were included in the PK analysis since the PK parameters were estimated appropriately by 
using the actual sampling time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018

With regards to the intense PK sampling group (PK Parameter Population) geometric mean values (CV% 
Geometric Mean) for Cmax, AUC0-t, and CL/F were 157 ng/mL (34.7%), 2737 ng·hr/mL (36.1%), and 1.10 
L/hr (36.1%), respectively. The median Tmax was 5.95 hours. 
Inter-individual variability could be observed when looking at the individual plasma concentration PK 
profiles. Furthermore the Cmax and AUC0-t were lower when compared to other studies conducted with 
lusutrombopag 3 mg. The applicant attributes both to the higher body weight in this study compared to 
other studies conducted in the Japanese Population. Genetic polymorphism is most likely not to play a 
major role behind the above mentioned observed differences. From the data available no definite 
difference in metabolism between ethnicities is clearly evident. The observed differences in exposure 
seem to be mainly driven by differences in bodyweight in the Japanese and Caucasian population, as also 
observed in the pop PK model where bodyweight was identified as an influential covariate on PK. No 
evidence for pharmacogenomic implication on PK could be identified from the dataset provided. 
Study S-888711-CB-315-N: “Population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic 
(PK/PD) was performed to describe the plasma concentration of lusutrombopag and evaluate the effects 
of influencing factors on the PK of lusutrombopag based on the pooled data from healthy subjects and 
thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD in 3 Phase 1 studies and 7 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (Studies 
M0611, M0613, M0615, M0623, M0625, M0626, M0627, M0631, M0633, and M0634). 
A total of 4196 plasma lusutrombopag concentrations from 427 subjects (78 healthy subjects and 349 
thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD) were included in the population PK analysis. Non-linear mixed 
effects modeling was performed using NONMEM. A 3-compartment model was used as a structural PK 
model. An exponential error model was used for inter-individual variability, and a proportional error 
model was used for intra-individual variability. 
For covariate modeling, age, body weight, creatinine clearance (CLcr), Child-Pugh class (normal, 
Child-Pugh class A, B, or C), sex (male or female), ethnicity/race (Japanese or non-Japanese), and 
subject population (healthy subjects or thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD) were tested as covariates 
on CL/F. Age, body weight, sex, ethnicity/race, and subject population were tested as covariates on V2/F. 
Body weight was tested as a covariate on volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V3/F).

Table 4: Summary of individual steady-state Cmax and AUC 0-T by subpopulation estimated 
using post-hoc PK parameters following 3 mg doses once daily for 7 days:  
Impaired renal function:  
Due to the fact that Lusutrombopag is primarily eliminated via the faces, no influence on the PK is to be 
expected from altered renal functionality. This is further emphasised by Results from the mass balance 
study conducted (Study M0619) and population PK analysis indicate only minimal influence of renal 
function on the PK of lusutrombopag. Therefore no dose adjustment is deemed necessary for patients 
with impaired renal function. 
Impaired hepatic function:  
The applicant conducted a hepatic impairment study (study M0616) which compared 8 healthy subjects 
with 16 subjects with hepatic impairment (8 Child Pugh A and 8 subjects with child Pugh B). Trends to 
increase of exposure with increased degree of hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects could 
be observed. The exposure increased by 5% and 20% in mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
compared with the healthy subjects. The limits of the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for % mean ratios 
of Cmax and AUCs were outside of the 80% to 125% equivalence interval in the hepatic impairment (mild 
or moderate) groups. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the Cmax of 
lusutrombopag was comparable (increase of 5%) but the AUC0-inf was 20% higher than in healthy adults.

Study M0627 evaluated the PK after administration of lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily for 7 days in 
thrombocytopenic Patients with Child-Pugh Class C Liver Disease. A total of 5 subjects (1 male and 4 
females, 50 to 74 years of age, mean 62.0 years) were enrolled. The applicant compared the PK results 
with study M0633. The mean exposure was found to be generally lower in subjects with Child-Pugh class 
C liver disease compared to Child-Pugh class A or B. The ranges of Cmax  and AUC0-τ observed overlapped 
in subjects with Child-Pugh class A, B, and C liver disease and the Cmax  and AUC0-τ of all subjects with 
Child-Pugh class C liver disease did not exceed the maximum values from Child-Pugh class A and class B.   
In the population PK model, the mean post-hoc Cmax  and AUC0-τ in 7 subjects with Child-Pugh class C liver 
disease (excluding the 1 subject with the Child-Pugh score of 9 in Study M0627) were lower than in 
subjects with Child-Pugh class A and B liver disease, as also indicated in noncompartmental analyses in 
Study M0627. 
The PK/PD modelling included a very limited number of patients with Child-Pugh class C (n=7). In the only 
study with class C patients (study 1525M0627), there were only 4 patients with Child-Pugh score above 
9. Moreover, the division into groups with Child-Pugh score ≥9  and <9 made in the modelling, does not 
correspond to the Child-Pugh classification (Class A – score 5-6; class B – score 7-9; class C – score 10–
15).  In the PK covariate modeling, it was confirmed that the inclusion of Child-Pugh classes (Child-Pugh 
class A vs B/C) into CL/F slightly improved the model based on the change of objective function value 
(ΔOBJ of −3.895, p > 0.01). In the PK/PD covariate modelling, the inclusion of Child-Pugh classes into the 
PD parameter (SLOP) was statistically significant (change in NONMEM objective function [ΔOBJ] of 
-11.878). However, it was found that SLOP increased for the higher Child-Pugh score group with a cut-off 
of 9, and the inclusion of Child-Pugh score (< 9 or ≥ 9) provided more statistically significant model 
improvement (ΔOBJ of -13.972) than the inclusion of Child-Pugh classes. Based on the comparison of 
ΔOBJ, the Child-Pugh score was selected as a covariate.   
Overall, when considering the main elimination pathway, impact on the PK of lusutrombopag seems to be 
likely since lusutrombopag is excreted mainly via the feces.  
Gender:   
Population PK analysis revealed that CL/F was 13% lower in women. However the applicant’s data and 
further analysis (plot for inferential assessment of covariate effect) support that differences in gender are 
rather negligible and do not require dose adjustments. 
Race:  
No relevant differences in the PK of lusutrombopag between black and non-black subjects have become 
apparent considering study M0615, M0616 and the pop PK Analysis.  
In the ANOVA in study M0614, t1/2,z tended to be longer in white subjects than Japanese subjects 
without being statistically significant.  
The effect of weight on the pharmacokinetics of Lusutrombopag was included in the population PK 
analysis as a significant covariate on CL/F, V2/F, and V3/F. It could be observed that the Cmax  and 
AUC0-τ decreased with increasing body weight, indicating body weight was an influential covariate on PK. 
The Cmax  and AUC0-τ decreased with increasing body weight, indicating body weight was an influential 
covariate on PK.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Lusutrombopag was suggested to primarily bind to the warfarin and diazepam sites on HSA. In 
investigation with [14C]-lusutrombopag (1 and 5 μg/mL) and 4% HSA (in vitro), the protein binding ratio

Page 48/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was not changed with the inhibitors (warfarin and diazepam, 1 and 10 μmol/L). Therefore, a drug 
interaction with lusutrombopag due to a change of the protein binding ratio is considered unlikely.  
The applicant conducted a study into potential interactions of lumbotromopag with drugs highly binding to 
the protein (warfarin and diazepam) assuming proper albumin concentration (4%), which causes that the 
abovementioned disturbances resulting from altered FU / total ratio and liver dysfunction, were not 
included in the way imprecisely modeling of clinical situations of patients with hepatic insufficiency. This 
is particularly important bearing in mind that a very limited number of Child-Pugh class C patients took 
part in pivotal studies and that there were few patients with severe hypolabuminemia (<28g/l) in the 
patient population undergoing the studies. 
The inducing and inhibitory effect of lusutrombopag on various cytochrome P450 enzymes and 
transporter proteins most commonly involved in drug metabolism have been investigated in vitro, as 
required by the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions. Bearing in mind that the in vitro 
induction study did not show increases in marker activities for the investigated enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, 
3A4, UGT1A2, 1A6, and 2B7), this could indicate that CAR and PXR is not activated by lusutrombopag. In 
addition, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, were not clinically significantly 
affected by co-administration of lusutrombopag in vivo. Concluding, the omission of investigating CYP2B6 
for the inducing potential of lusutrombopag can be accepted based on the applicant’s justification. 
Based on the in vitro results, lusutrombopag was demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on BCRP 
(breast cancer resistance protein), P-gp (P-glycoprotein), OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (organic 
anion-transporting polypeptide) as well as OCT1 (organic cation transport). Further investigations 
demonstrated that lusutrombopag is a P-gp and BCRP-substrate, but is not a substrate of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 or OCT1.  For potential inhibitory effects on OATP1B1, the Applicant provided detailed 
calculations in accordance with the EMA guideline on drug interactions, which show that the cut off values 
for criteria (as by the mentioned guideline) were net exceeded for OATB1B1. Thus, in vivo inhibition is not 
expected.  The DDI potential of lusutrombopag for transporters other than BCRP would be low because 
the calculated values for criteria did not exceed the cut-off value for each transporter (in accordance with 
the EMA guideline on drug interactions). According to the applicant, the DDI potential of lusutrombopag 
for BCRP would be low because of the high plasma protein binding and low solubility (see further 
discussion below). 
Effect of other drugs on Pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag 
Based on the in vitro results, lusutrombopag was shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. To address 
these in vitro findings, the clinical DDI study 1514M061E was conducted, which was a randomized, 
open-label, 3-period crossover study in healthy Japanese adult male subjects.  
Co-administration with cyclosporine, which is a BCRP and P-gp dual inhibitor, increased lusutrombopag 
Cmax by 18% and AUCs by 19% compared with lusutrombopag alone. The upper limit of 90% CI 
(geometric means) for Cmax was only slightly lower than 125%, and for AUClast and AUCinf slightly 
exceeded 125%, indicating that that P-gp and BCRP inhibition slightly increases lusutrombopag plasma 
exposure.  
The results from study M061E show that mean Cmax and AUC is increased by roughly 20% upon 
co-administration of cyclosporine and with the upper limit of the 90%CI being >125 % do not support the 
statement that the effect of co-administration with a BCRP/P-gp inhibitor is only “slight”. Therefore, a 
potential for drug interactions cannot be excluded and a respective statement was requested to be 
included in the SmPC. However, it was agreed with the applicant that platelet monitoring seems not 
necessary as an additional precaution, also considering that exceeding 200,000/µL platelets is not a 
validated surrogate for the risk of thrombotic events.

Lusutrombopag is mainly metabolized by CYP4 enzymes, including CYP4A11. CYP3A4 was also suggested 
to be contributing to the ω-oxidation of lusutrombopag (production of 6-hydroxylated lusutrombopag). 
Drugs known to inhibit or induce CYP4A11 and CYP3A4 could therefore potentially affect the PK of 
lusutrombopag. With regard to CYP4 enzyme inhibition, no drugs have been reported to cause a drug 
interaction in clinical use. While peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) is known to 
regulate expression of CYP4A enzymes, the induction potential of CYP4A by fibrates (PPARα agonists) is 
very low in humans and drug interactions via induction of any CYP4A enzymes have not been reported in 
clinical use. Therefore, inducers and inhibitors of CYP4A enzymes, including CYP4A11, are unlikely to 
affect the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. It is worth noting that the CYP4A11 play an important role 
in regulation of blood pressure through the conversion of arachidonic acid into 20-HETE and its 
polymorphism may be an important risk factor for hypertension, coronary artery disease or cerebral 
infarction. Bearing in mind that the main metabolic route of lusutrombopag is related to CYP4A11, its 
polymorphism may change the exposure to lusutrombopag. Therefore, the applicant should discuss the 
importance of CYP4A11 polymorphism in metabolism of lusutrombopag. The applicant further assumed 
that the PK of lusutrombopag would be minimally changed even if CYP3A4 activity were inhibited, since 
the contribution of CYP3A4 to ω–oxidation is considered to be limited compared to that of CYP4 enzymes. 
Given that CYP3A4 is contributing to the metabolic pathway of lusutrombopag (contribution to ω–
oxidation) and in order to support that co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers do not affect the 
PK/PD of lusutrombopag to a clinically significant extent (e.g., consistently resulting in higher exposures 
or higher platelet counts), the applicant compared PK/PD parameters (Cmax, AUC, and peak platelet 
count) between CLD patients with and without co-administration of moderate and strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers (using the population PK and PK/PD dataset used for Study S-888711-CB-315-N). 
The PK/PD parameters were in the same range for all patients and did not show a trend for increasing or 
decreasing PK or PD parameters of lusutrombopag, when co-administered with moderate and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Although the number of patients receiving either CYP3A4 inhibitors or 
inducers is generally low, there is no indication that co-administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer 
affects the PK and PD (i.e., peak platelet counts) of lusutrombopag to a clinically significant extent.   
Study 0924M0618 investigated the effect of calcium (4 g as calcium carbonate) on the PK of 
lusutrombopag after administration of 0.75 mg. Based on the results, it can be concluded that Calcium 
does not have a substantial effect on the PK of lusutrombopag. The findings also suggest no influence of 
multivalent cations contained e.g. in antacids, mineral supplements or dairy products on the PK of 
lusutrombopag. Given the linear PK of lusutrombopag, a similar lack of effect as for the 0.75 mg dose is 
anticipated with the 3-mg dose. 
The pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, are not clinically significantly affected 
by co-administration of lusutrombopag. This conclusion is based on the results from the clinical DDI study 
0912M6017 as well as the PBPK (physiologically based pharmacokinetic) modelling and simulation (Study 
S-888711-CB-288-N).  
Study 0912M6017 was a fixed-sequence drug interaction study in healthy adult subjects. A single 5-mg 
dose of midazolam (as syrup) was administered alone on Day 1 under fasting conditions with 240 mL 
water, followed by administration of a 1.5 mg dose (6 × 0.25 mg) lusutrombopag on Day 2 after which 
0.75-mg doses (3 × 0.25 mg) lusutrombopag were administered once daily for 6 days (Days 3 to 8). On 
Day 8, a single 5-mg dose of midazolam was co-administered with the last dose of lusutrombopag.The 
90% CIs for the geometric least squares mean ratios of Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of midazolam 
(co-administration with lusutrombopag to single administration of midazolam) were within the 
pre-specified standard bioequivalence margin of 0.80 to 1.25. This is in accordance with the EMA 
Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**, 2012), stating 
that a drug inducing a <1.25 fold increase in the plasma AUC of the probe drug is not classified as a CYP3A 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 50/142 
 
 
 
inhibitor. It can therefore be concluded that multiple-dose administration of 0.75 mg lusutrombopag does 
not affect the PK of midazolam. 
The PBPK modelling and simulation was performed for 100 subjects (10 trials and 10 subjects per trial) 
under the scenario that lusutrombopag 3 mg or 6 mg was administered once daily on Day 1 to 14 and 
midazolam 5 mg was co-administered with lusutrombopag as a CYP3A4 inhibitor on Day 15. A statistically 
significant difference was demonstrated for Cmax and AUC following co-administration of 5 mg 
midazolam with lusutrombopag (3 mg and 6 mg) compared to administration of midazolam alone, as the 
90%PI for the ratios did not contain 1, indicating a higher exposure of lusutrombopag when 
co-administered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor. As the 90% PIs were entirely contained within the pre-specified 
margins of 0.8-1.25, it can be agreed that there is no clinically significant effect of lusutrombopag 3 mg 
on the PK of midazolam, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
In conclusion, lusutrombopag seems to have a low potential for CYP induction or inhibition in humans and 
is not considered a CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor or inducer. However, according to the study report, the 
0.75mg dose of lusutrombopag was chosen as a likely clinical dose, but the extent of exposure to 
lusutrombopag during study 0912M6017 was 6 mg (1.5 mg + 6 x0.75mg), which does not correspond to 
exposure achieved through administration of lusutrombopag according to recommended posology (3 mg 
x 7 days). Although the simulations using the PBPK model indicated no clinically significant DDI potential 
of lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily on CYP3A4 activity, the Applicant was asked to discuss the interaction 
study conducted at a dose of 0.75 mg (total exposure of 6mg) of lusutrombopag, reflect the clinical 
conditions where patients should receive lusutrombopag at a dose of 3mg for 7 days. In response to the 
questions raised in the day 120 LoQ, the applicant further indicated, that a clinical DDI study for 
evaluating the DDI potential of multiple doses of lusutrombopag 3 mg in healthy subjects could not be 
conducted on ethical grounds due to a risk of overshooting platelet counts. Therefore, the PBPK modelling 
approach reported in Study S-888711-CB-288-N was performed to extrapolate the DDI potential of 
lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily from the result in the clinical DDI study with the lower dose (Study 
M0617). Based on the Guideline on the investigation of Drug Interactions a mechanistic static model with 
the result of reversible inhibition study was used, which indicated that lusutrombopag is unlikely to inhibit 
the CYP3A4 enzymes at the clinical dose of 3 mg once daily according to the decision criterion. 
Clinically significant drug interactions involving glucuronidation are not anticipated as the major 
elimination pathway for lusutrombopag is primarily primarily ω-oxidation followed by β-oxidation of 
O-hexyl group.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lusutrombopag is an orally active, small-molecule thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist. It acts on the 
transmembrane domain of human TPO receptors to stimulate megakaryocytes to proliferate and 
differentiate via the signal transduction pathway, thus upregulating platelet production. The mechanism 
of action confirms the legitimacy of using lusutrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
For the studies of multiple-dose administration in thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD (M0625, M0626, 
M0627, M0631, M0633, and M0634), a relationship between the observed maximum percent change in 
platelet count from baseline and the total exposure of lusutrombopag calculated from the PK parameters 
in individual subjects is shown below.  
Figure 7: Relationship Between Observed Maximum % of Change in Platelet Count from 
Baseline and Predicted Total AUC of Lusutrombopag in Subjects with Chronic Liver Disease 
With multiple-dose administration of lusutrombopag to thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD (Studies 
M0623, M0625, M0626, M0627, M0631, M0633, and M0634), the percent of platelet count increase 
correlated to the total exposure of lusutrombopag in plasma; the maximum percent change in platelet 
count from baseline increased in an exposure-dependent manner. The relationship was similar between 
Japanese and no-Japanese thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD. 
Based on Phase 1 studies, no PD differences were observed between non-Japanese subjects and 
Japanese subjects that would suggest the dose modification is not required in these two populations. 
Additionally, bioavailability study has demonstrated the full comparability of the primary PK parameters 
between EU subjects and Japanese subjects. 
A simplified platelet aggregation test was performed in 71 healthy subjects with a single agonist 
concentration (adenosine diphosphate of 2 µM or collagen of 1 µg/mL) in Study M0611 (36 receiving 
lusutrombopag [6 per dose level] and 11 receiving placebo) and in the multiple-dose study (Study 
M0613, 18 receiving lusutrombopag [6 per dose level] and 6 receiving placebo). Mean values of the 
maximum platelet aggregation rate, the number of subjects with abnormal platelet aggregation, and the 
incidence of abnormal platelet aggregation in each lusutrombopag group (1 to 50 mg) showed similar 
profiles to those in the placebo group at all the time points in Study M0611. After multiple dosing for 14 
days in Study M0613 (2-mg tablet, 0.25- or 0.5-mg lusutrombopag solution, or placebo), platelet

aggregation was within the normal range. In the study of multiple-dose administration of lusutrombopag 
in subjects with CLD (Study M061B), lusutrombopag did not alter the platelet aggregation ability and 
platelet release ability.  
No clinically significant changes from baseline were observed in the aggregation and activation of 
platelets in subjects with CLD or healthy subjects, thus suggesting that lusutrombopag is unlikely to affect 
platelet function (M0613and M061B).  
Change in QTcF from baseline after the single administration of lusutrombopag 6 mg and 24 mg in healthy 
adults was comparable to that in the placebo group. Additionally, no correlation was found between 
plasma lusutrombopag concentration and the time-matched difference of the change from baseline in 
QTcF between active and placebo groups.  
Anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are the major types of blood cell cytopenias of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Lusutrombopag did not induce formation of erythroid colonies 
at the concentration at which formation of megakaryocyte colonies was induced, and the number of 
erythroid colonies was not significantly different in concomitant treatment with EPO and lusutrombopag, 
as compared to treatment with EPO alone. Similarly, lusutrombopag did not induce formation of 
granulocytic/macrophage colonies, and the number of colonies neither increased nor decreased in 
concomitant treatment with G-CSF and lusutrombopag as compared to in treatment with G-CSF alone. 
The results indicate that lusutrombopag had no effect on EPO or G-CSF-induced hematopoietic colony 
formation. Administration of lusutrombopag is unlikely to affect the pharmacological effect of EPO and 
G-CSF in MDS patients on monotherapy with EPO or concomitant therapy with EPO and G-CSF. 
Platelet response was observed in thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD with once-daily doses ranging 
from 2 to 4 mg. In the Phase 2b Study M0626, the proportion of subjects who received no preprocedural 
platelet transfusion (the primary endpoint) was significantly greater with lusutrombopag doses of 2, 3, 
and 4 mg/day than with placebo. This proportion was 80% or more in each lusutrombopag dose group 
and tended to increase modestly with increasing dose of lusutrombopag.  
The proportion of responders exceeded 50% on 2 days (Days 12 and 14) in the 2-mg group, 12 days 
(Days 10 to 21) in the 3-mg group, and 14 days (Days 8 to 21) in the 4-mg group, showing that the 
treatment effect was observed earlier and maintained for a longer duration with the 3- and 4-mg doses of 
lusutrombopag than with the 2-mg dose. Thus, doses greater than 2 mg would afford the clinician 
increased flexibility if a patient’s schedule or condition required a delay of the elective procedure for 
preprocedural platelet transfusion or other reasons. As the lusutrombopag adverse event profile was not 
dose dependent at doses up to 4 mg/day in this patient population, the longer window of platelet response 
achievable with doses higher than 2 mg offered increased clinical benefit without increased risk to the 
patient. Thus, the once-daily dose of 2 mg was eliminated from further consideration as the 
to-be-marketed dose.  
High variability in platelet count may occur in individuals over a short period of time. Considering the risk 
of high variability in platelet count, that platelet counts of ≥200,000/µL were associated with an increased 
risk of thrombosis in a clinical study of another TPO receptor agonist in thrombocytopenic subjects with 
CLD, and that the goal of treatment is to achieve a platelet count of ≥50,000/µL to avoid preprocedural 
platelet transfusion, the 4-mg dose was eliminated from further consideration as the to-be-marketed 
dose. However, there was no evidence of an increase in incidence of adverse events with increasing dose 
of lusutrombopag in thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD undergoing elective invasive procedures. 
Therefore, analyses to assess the relationship between exposure of lusutrombopag and adverse events 
were not performed. 
For the lusutrombopag 3-mg dose, the probabilities of attaining a platelet count of 50,000/μL were > 80% 
and the probabilities of platelet count exceeding 200,000/μL were ≤ 0.5% for any population. The

simulation supports the dose regimen of 3 mg once daily for 7 days in non-Japanese as well as Japanese 
thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD. 
Summary of Simulated Platelet Indices for Dose Response 
Simulations were performed with 200 replicates using the original dataset. QD = once daily; PLT = 
platelet 
To evaluate the pharmacological activity of lusutrombopag on various enzymes and receptors, in vitro ion 
channels and inhibitory assay for 11 enzymes or binding assay for 30 receptors were performed and the 
IC50 values were determined. Based on the comprehensive assay, lusutrombopag was shown to have 
inhibitory activities (≥50%) for 2 receptors and 3 enzymes at 10 µmol/L. The IC50 of adrenergic α2C, 
leukotriene B4, COX-1,  COX-2, and phosphodiesterase 1 were calculated as 2.75 µmol/L (1.63 µg/mL), 
2.78  µmol/L (1.64 µg/mL), 16.2 µmol/L (9.58 µg/mL), 4.08 µmol/L (2.41 µg/mL), and 1.36  µmol/L 
(0.80 µg/mL), respectively. In the clinical trial in thrombocytopenic patients with CLD treated with 
lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily for up to 7 days, the Cmax was determined to be 157 ng/mL on Day 5 
[refer to Study 1423M0634]. In addition, the protein binding ratio of lusutrombopag in human plasma 
was extremely high (≥99.9%); the Cmax of non-binding unchanged lusutrombopag should be equal to or 
less than 0.157  ng/mL (157 ng/mL × <0.001). By considering these evidences, IC50 values of 2 
receptors and 3 enzymes were estimated to be approximately 5100-fold higher than the plasma 
concentration of unbound unchanged lusutrombopag. In conclusion, it is considered that lusutrombopag 
at 3 mg may have no or little effect on enzymes, ion channels, or other receptors except for the TPO 
receptor.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In total, 21 clinical studies contributed to PK and or PD data. Furthermore, a Pop PK Analysis was 
conducted. From the data set provided, following information could be derived: 
Absorption: After oral administration, lusutrombopag is absorbed with a peak concentration occurring 6.0 
to 8.0 hours in multiple dose studies conducted in thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD.  In multiple dose 
studies in healthy subjects, median Tmax values ranged from 4 to 8 hours (day 7 or day 14) after 
ingestion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 54/142 
 
 
 
 
After multiple dosing, steady state appears to be achieved by day 5 [Study M0613 (Multiple dose in 
healthy subjects) and Study M0617 (DDI Study with Midazolam)] to day 7 [M0615 (multiple dose in 
healthy subjects)].  
Distribution: Lusutrombopag is highly bound to human plasma proteins, with a high binding ratio of 
99.996%. In study M061E, it could be observed, that the geometric mean (% CV) apparent volume of 
distribution during the terminal phase of lusutrombopag in healthy adult subjects was 39.5 L (23.5%) 
after the administration of a 3mg tablet in 16 subjects. The distribution of radioactivity into blood cells 
was observed to be minimal, with essentially no binding to the red blood cells. In blood, 
[14C]-lusutrombopag was distributed mainly in the plasma.   
Metabolism: Lusutrombopag was suggested to be metabolized primarily by ω-oxidation followed by 
β-oxidation of O-hexyl group. In in vitro studies revealed that CYP4 enzymes including CYP4A11 and 
partially CYP3A4 enzyme were contributed to ω-oxidation to form 6-hydroxylated lusutrombopag.  
Metabolite profiling in the mass balance study suggested that lusutrombopag may be primarily 
metabolized by oxidation of the hexyl group followed by β-oxidation of O-hexyl side chain in the liver. 
Results of in vitro studies indicate, that lusutrombopag is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but is not a 
substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1.  
Approximately 97% of plasma radioactivity was detected as unchanged lusutrombopag. The metabolites 
(deshexyl, β oxidated carboxylic acid, taurine conjugate of β-oxidated carboxylic acid, and 
acyl-glucuronide) were only detected at a trace level (each constituting ≤ 2.6% of plasma radioactivity). 
Elimination:  The primary route of excretion of Lusutrombopag is via the faeces. The terminal elimination 
half-life t1/2,z was:  
19.3 to 29.5 hours (geometric mean) in single dose studies in healthy subjects 
27.0 to 32.0 hours in multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects 
31.9 to 43.9 hours in multiple-dose studies in subjects with CLD  
Terminal elimination half-life and apparent total clearance (CL/F) did not show a dose dependent change. 
In the feces unchanged lusutrombopag was detected as 16.22% of administered radioactivity and a 
mixture of deshexyl and O-propanol (or O-acetic acid) metabolites were detected as 17.93% of 
administered radioactivity. 
Exposure: When looking at the Cmax and AUC values throughout the studies conducted, a dose 
proportional increase could be observed in both, healthy and thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD 
suggesting PK linearity across the dose range studied (1 to 50 mg for a single dose in healthy subjects; 
0.25 to 2 mg for multiple doses in healthy subjects; and 0.25 to 4 mg for multiple doses in 
thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD). Cmax and AUC0-τ can be deemed comparable between healthy 
Japanese subjects and Japanese thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD after multiple-dose administration 
with only slight differences. Differences between Caucasian (Study M0634) and Asian ethnicity seem to 
be related to the different bodyweight these populations (M0634 mixed non-Japanese population: 
(intense PK group) [range]: 86.9 [57.1 to 123.4] kg) in comparison to studies M061B (56.3 [45.6 to 74.9] 
and M0633 63.8 [39.5 to 86.5] kg) (Japanese population). Furthermore, the pop PK model identified 
bodyweight as an influential covariate on PK.  
Lusutrombopag is metabolised mainly by CYP4 enzymes, including CYP4A11. It is worth noting that the 
CYP4A11 play an important role in regulation of blood pressure through the conversion of arachidonic acid 
into 20-HETE and its polymorphism may be an important risk factor for hypertension, coronary artery 
disease or cerebral infarction. Bearing in mind that the main metabolic route of lusutrombopag is related 
to CYP4A11, its polymorphism could potentially change the exposure to lusutrombopag. However, as 
outlined by the applicant CYP4A11 can increase the AUC in poor metabolizers, but the fold increase in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018

exposure is considered to be less than 2, at even maximum risk evaluation. Bearing in mind that there is 
a possibility that alternative metabolic pathways may be activated for poor metabolizers, the AUC in poor 
metabolizers might not change compared with that in extensive metabolizers.  
From the data provided it can be concluded that the influence of high-fat, high-calorie meal and calcium 
on the PK and BA of lusutrombopag is only minimal and very likely clinically not meaningful. No specific 
restriction with regards to food intake is deemed necessary. 
All PK studies showed consistent results with no major discrepancies with regards to the PK of 
Lusutrombopag and the PK analysis were performed by non-compartmental methods. 
The population PK analysis performed describes the plasma concentration of lusutrombopag and 
evaluates the effects of influencing factors on the PK of lusutrombopag based on the pooled data from 
healthy subjects and thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD in 3 Phase 1 studies and 7 Phase 2 and Phase 
3 studies (Studies M0611, M0613, M0615, M0623, M0625, M0626, M0627, M0631, M0633, and M0634). 
A total of 4196 plasma lusutrombopag concentrations from 427 subjects (78 healthy subjects and 349 
thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD) were included in the population PK analysis. Non-linear mixed 
effects modeling was performed using NONMEM. A 3-compartment model was used as a structural PK 
model. An exponential error model was used for inter-individual variability, and a proportional error 
model was used for intra-individual variability. 
After covariate modeling, the effects of body weight, sex, ethnicity, and subject population on CL/F, body 
weight and subject population on V2/F, and body weight on V3/F were retained in the final model. 
The final model indicated that CL/F in females was 13% lower than that in males. CL/F in the 
thrombocytopenic subjects was 13% lower than that in the healthy subjects. CL/F in the Japanese 
subjects was 13% lower than that in the non-Japanese subjects.  Inferential assessment of each covariate 
effect with the median and the confidence interval from the bootstrap effect of sex, subject population 
and ethnicity on CL/F, all were within or close to the limits of the confidence interval defined suggesting 
rather negligible clinical relevance.   
The final model indicated that Body weight was an influential covariate on lusutrombopag PK for healthy 
subjects and subjects with CLD.  When looking at body weight, the Cmax and AUC0-τ decreased with 
increasing body weight in thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD. Although body weight affects the PK of 
lusutrombopag, the platelet count profiles seem to be only modestly influenced according to the PK/PD 
simulation, suggesting that no dose adjustment based on body weight is considered necessary. From a 
pharmacodynamics perspective, the provided data show a trend of higher peak platelet counts in patients 
with lower body weight. Recommendations in section 4.4 of the SmPC were requested to be added with 
regard to additional platelet monitoring for this subpopulation.  
As regards the effect of ascites and albumin concentration on the PK/PD analysis, the applicant provided 
further discussion in this context. No clinically relevant effect seems to be apparent, since most of the 
relevant PK parameters and platelet counts were comparable. 
Despite the fact that population PK analysis was based on data from healthy adult subjects and 
thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD, age was not identified as a statistically significant covariate for the 
PK of lusutrombopag. Using a noncompartmental method in the multiple-dose study (Study M0615) it 
could be observed that the CL/F (apparent total clearance) tended to increase with increasing body weight 
(regression equation CL/F = 0.357 × body weight 1.03). 
With regards to hepatic impairment some uncertainties remain. Impact on the PK of lusutrombopag is 
likely since lusutrombopag is excreted mainly via the faeces. Unfortunately only very few subjects with 
child Pugh class C were available for evaluation (n=7 – study 1525M0627 and 1423M0634), therefore no 
firm conclusions can be drawn for severe cases of hepatic impairment. It is furthermore important to note 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 56/142 
 
 
 
that in the studies used for PK/PD modelling, Child-Pugh class C was exclusion criterion (even in the study 
1423M0634, 3 patients in class C were included incorrectly because they did not meet inclusion criteria - 
Child-Pugh class A or B). In the only study with class C patients (study 1525M0627), there were only 4 
patients with Child-Pugh score above 9.  
The division into groups with Child-Pugh score ≥9  and <9 does not correspond to the Child-Pugh 
classification (Class A – score 5-6; class B – score 7-9; class C – score 10 – 15). In order to address this 
issue, the applicant has provided a discussion on this matter in response to the questions raised in the day 
120 LoQ. In the PK covariate modelling, it was confirmed that the inclusion of Child-Pugh classes 
(Child-Pugh class A vs B/C) into CL/F slightly improved the model based on the change of objective 
function value (ΔOBJ of −3.895, p > 0.01). In the PK/PD covariate modelling, the inclusion of Child-Pugh 
classes into the PD parameter (SLOP) was statistically significant (change in NONMEM objective function 
[ΔOBJ] of -11.878). However, it was found that SLOP increased for the higher Child-Pugh score group 
with a cut-off of 9, and the inclusion of Child-Pugh score (< 9 or ≥ 9) provided more statistically significant 
model improvement (ΔOBJ of -13.972) than the inclusion of Child-Pugh classes. Based on the comparison 
of ΔOBJ, the Child-Pugh score was selected as a covariate.  
While for Child Pugh class A and B only modest differences in PK were observed the data presented so far 
is not thoroughly convincing with regards to the applicants conclusion, that no dose adjustments or 
precaution measures are necessary. This is especially true considering the already described main 
elimination pathway of lusutrombopag, the results of the hepatic impairment study M0616 and the overall 
limited sample size of subjects with Child-Pugh class C. The applicant proposes warning statements within 
section 4.4. of the SmPC concerning close monitoring for early signs of worsening and platelet counts 
monitoring in Child Pugh Class C subjects in order to ensure safety in this subgroup of patients with an 
unmet medical need. Considering that the PK/PD modelling seem to indicate that no clinically significant 
differences are to be expected on platelet increase of lusutrombopag in patients with different severity of 
hepatic impairment, the proposed warning statements in section 4.4. of the SmPC are deemed adequate 
from a PK perspective. 
Regarding the effect of lusutrombopag on transporter proteins, lusutrombopag was shown in vitro to be 
a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1. In the clinical DDI 
study M061E, lusutrombopag exposure was indeed increased, i.e. Cmax by 18% and AUCs by 19%, with 
co-administration of cyclosporine (a P-gp and BCRP dual inhibitor) compared with lusutrombopag alone. 
The upper limit of 90% CI (geometric means) for Cmax was only slightly lower than 125%, and for 
AUClast and AUCinf slightly exceeded 125%, indicating that that P-gp and BCRP inhibition modestly 
increases lusutrombopag plasma exposure. The potential for drug interactions with BCRP/P-gp inhibitors 
cannot be excluded and a respective statement referring to concomitant administration with either BCRP 
or P-gp inhibitors was included into section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Regarding the effect of lusutrombopag on cytochrome P450 enzymes, lusutrombopag seems to have a 
low potential for CYP induction or inhibition in humans based on the results of the conducted DDI study 
(-M0617). In this DDI study -M0617, the 0.75mg dose of lusutrombopag was chosen as a likely clinical 
dose, but the extent of exposure to lusutrombopag during study 0912M6017 was 6 mg (1.5 mg + 6 
x0.75mg), which does not correspond to exposure achieved through administration of lusutrombopag 
according to recommended posology (3 mg x 7 days). However, the applicant has further addressed this 
matter and indicated that a clinical DDI study for evaluating the DDI potential of multiple doses of 
lusutrombopag 3 mg in healthy subjects could not be conducted on ethical grounds due to a risk of 
overshooting platelet counts. Therefore, the PBPK modelling approach reported in Study 
S-888711-CB-288-N was performed to extrapolate the DDI potential of lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily 
from the result in the clinical DDI study with the lower dose (Study M0617). Based on the Guideline on the 
investigation of Drug Interactions a mechanistic static model with the result of reversible inhibition study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 57/142 
 
 
 
was used, which indicated that lusutrombopag is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzymes at the clinical 
dose of 3 mg once daily according to the decision criterion. 
No substantial effect of calcium on the PK of lusutrombopag has become apparent. The findings also 
suggest no influence of multivalent cations contained in antacids, mineral supplements, dairy products, 
etc. on the PK of lusutrombopag. Lusutrombopag is metabolized mainly by CYP4 enzymes, including 
CYP4A11. CYP4A11 polymorphism is not considered to have a significant effect on metabolism of 
lusutrombopag. Further, taking into account that CYP3A4 is contributing to the ω–oxidation, further 
elaboration was asked to be provided on the potential effect of co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
or inducers on the PK of lusutrombopag. From the clinical studies, there was however no indication that 
the PK and PD (i.e., peak platelet counts) of lusutrombopag would be affected to a clinically significant 
extent when co-administrated with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.   
In investigation with [14C]-lusutrombopag (1 and 5 μg/mL) and 4% HSA, the protein binding ratio was 
not changed with the inhibitors (warfarin and diazepam, 1 and 10 μmol/L). Therefore, a drug interaction 
with lusutrombopag due to a change of the protein binding ratio is unlikely. In response to the questions 
raised in the day 120 LoQ, the applicant has provided further analysis, indicating no clear relationship 
between PK/PD parameters and albumin concentration. Furthermore, PK parameters appeared to be 
comparable between patients with and without severe hypoalbuminemia.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of lusutrombopag, i.e. the increase in platelet count, has been 
assessed in 8 clinical phase 2 and phase 3 studies in thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD.  
Relevant pharmacodynamics endpoints that were assessed were time course of platelet count, mean 
maximum platelet counts, mean time to reach maximum platelet counts as well as change from baseline 
in platelet counts. 
Overall, platelet count increased with increasing doses of lusutrombopag up to 4 mg, supporting the 
plausibility of the postulated mechanism of action.  
The initially investigated lower doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg and 1.5 mg did not show evidence of efficacy, but 
platelet count increased over time in the 1.5- and 2-mg groups. Eventually, a dose of 3 mg once daily was 
chosen by the Applicant based on the best benefit risk profile of lusutrombopag: longer duration of 
platelet response achievable with lusutrombopag doses higher than 2 mg, and reduction of the risk of 
excessive platelet counts with the 4 mg dose.  
For the 3 mg dose, the mean maximum platelet count was 80,000 to 95,000/µL and the range of 
maximum platelet counts was 25,000 to 195,000/µL (excl. one patient) throughout the clinical studies in 
thrombocytopenic patients with CLD. Maximum platelet counts did not exceed 200,000/μL, except in one 
patient related to unallowed previous medication with another TPO receptor agonist. The mean time to 
reach maximum platelet counts was 12 to 14 days (range 5-35 days) and the mean number of days 
during which platelet count was ≥50,000/µL was 19 to 24 days in all studies with patients. 
A sequential PK and PD modelling approach was applied, including the 4196 plasma concentration data 
from the 427 subjects (78 healthy subjects and 349 patients) and 3526 platelet count data from 347 
patients were used for the population PK and PK/PD analyses. Overall, conclusions deduced from the 
model do not stand in contradiction to the data generated in the clinical studies and the model is 
considered of supportive character only. 
All efficacy and safety studies were conducted applying a study treatment stopping criterion, except one 
phase 3 B study (-M0633) in Japanese thrombocytopenic patients with CLD.

This latter study is used to support the 7 days fixed dosing regimen with no need of additional platelet 
monitoring in the intended study population. Indeed, no clear difference in platelet response for patients 
without platelet transfusion was found between the group receiving a fixed dosing regimen of 7 days and 
the group where a stopping criterion was applied. No platelet counts >200,000/µL were observed in any 
studies in patients, including those having received at least one more dose of study drug than would have 
been administered had the stopping criterion been applied (n=20; maximum platelet count was 
173,000/µL). The PK/PD model suggests a low probability (i.e. 0.43%) of reaching excessive platelet 
counts, which could be reduced only to 0.2-0.3% if one day of platelet monitoring was performed. Overall, 
however, clinical data in patients without applying a stopping criterion is very sparse. Additional platelet 
monitoring at least once approximately 5 days after the first lusutrombopag dose is advised for the 
different subsets of patients at higher risk, i.e, patients with Child Pugh C liver disease and patients with 
body weight <45 kg. Appropriate measures such as discontinuation of lusutrombopag should be taken, if 
the platelet count reaches ≥50,000/µL as a result of a 20,000/µL increase from baseline. 
Certain subpopulations were identified with differences in exposure of lusutrombopag, e.g. patients with 
Child-Pugh class B/C or score ≥9/<9, Japanese versus Non-Japanese patients or patients with lower body 
weight. The PK/PD model suggested a higher platelet count increase in patients with low body weight (< 
45 kg) and a higher probability (2.05%) with a 7 day fixed dosing regimen compared to the general 
intended population (0.43%) was estimated based on this model. Further analyses of the platelet count 
profiles classified by body weight groups, Child Pugh A/B and C class as well as by ethnicity were asked to 
be provided. These analyses confirmed a trend for higher peak platelet count in patients with lower body 
weight. Section 4.4. of the SmPC was amended in this regard. Observed differences in exposure between 
Japanese and Non-Japanese patients are likely influenced by differences in body weight based on the 
analyses provided. No robust conclusions can therefore be drawn in this regard. It is however considered 
unlikely that Non-Japanese patients will show a differential response compared to Japanese patients. 
Based on the provided data, there seems to be a trend in patients with Child Pugh C liver disease for lower 
mean platelet count profiles compared to patients with Child Pugh liver disease A and B, although more 
obvious in Non-Japanese  patients. This may however also be influenced by body weight. Overall, an 
insufficient number of patients with Child-Pugh class C liver disease was included in the studies, therefore 
no robust conclusions on the pharmacological response in this subpopulation can be drawn. Hence, the 
warning in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Platelet function was assessed in a dedicated study in thrombocytopenic patients with CLD (study 
-1301061B). Overall, no abnormal results on platelet aggregation or platelet release were found and no 
tendency of increase in morphologically abnormal platelet was shown after administration of 
lusutrombopag.  
No secondary pharmacological effects of lusutrombopag were observed, e.g. white or red blood cell 
increase, which seem plausible based on similarity of EPO- or GM-CSF- and TPO-receptors. The effect of 
lusutrombopag on the QTc interval was investigated in a dedicated thorough QT/QTc study. Based on the 
provided data from a dedicated thorough QT/QTc study, an effect of lusutrombopag on the QT interval is 
considered unlikely. In a DDI study investigating co-administration with cyclosporine, a slight 
prolongation of heart rate and QT intervals was observed. However, this was likely associated with the 
cyclosporine administration and not attributed to lusutrombopag.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In conclusion, the PK of lusutrombopag was well characterised by various clinical studies and Pop PK 
modelling included in the dossier, with no major discrepancies between the study results.

Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic effect of lusutrombopag, i.e. the increase of platelet counts, has been well 
demonstrated in healthy subjects as well as in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease. The 
recommended 3 mg dose of lusutrombopag was chosen based on the exposure response relationship.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The efficacy of lusutrombopag as treatment for subjects who have CLD and are at increased risk for 
bleeding associated with elective invasive procedures was evaluated in 6 studies. Lusutrombopag was 
administered for up to 7 days in all studies (with duration of treatment determined by platelet response 
in all but 1 of the studies). In particular, in 5 of the 6 studies, platelet count was determined on at least 
Days 5, 6, and 7 to monitor subjects for an excessive increase in platelets and to allow treatment to be 
stopped. 
Although elevated platelet numbers are intended and protective against bleeding events in 
thrombocytopenia before invasive procedures, at the same time there is concern that a too high increase 
could lead to complications with regard to thromboembolic events. This concerns stems in part from a 
phase III trial with eltrombopag (Afdahl et al 2012), a small molecule TPO agonist in 292 patients with 
chronic liver disease and severe thrombocytopenia who received eltrombopag or placebo for 14 days and 
subsequently underwent an elective invasive procedure. The trial was terminated early due to thrombotic 
events of the portal venous system which were observed in 6 patients who received eltrombopag, as 
compared with 1 who received placebo. An association between platelet counts of 200,000 per cubic 
millimetre or higher and an increased risk of thrombotic events was identified in a post hoc analysis. The 
investigators concluded that changes in dosing (a decreased dose, less-frequent dosing, or a shorter 
duration of dosing) could be used to minimise the proportion of patients who have a platelet count of 
200,000 per cubic millimetre or higher, while maintaining a platelet count that is sufficiently high for the 
patient to undergo an elective invasive procedure without having substantial bleeding or requiring a 
platelet transfusion. 
Phase II: 
All three phase II trials enrolled patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh Class A or B and severe 
thrombocytopenia planned to undergo percutaneous liver ablation. In the initial Phase II study M0623, 
low doses of lusutrombopag (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/day) were evaluated, followed by evaluation of doses 
of 1.5 and 2 mg/day. It was observed that doses below 2 mg did not show an appreciable impact on 
platelet counts. In the subsequent Phase II study M0625, lusutrombopag doses of 2.5 mg (n=6), 3 mg 
(n=7) and 4 mg (n=8) per day up to 7 days were evaluated. The investigated doses lead to 
indistinguishable efficacy responses in these limited patient numbers. 
The double-blind, parallel-group, placebo (n=15) controlled trial M0626 investigated doses of 2 mg 
(n=15), 3 mg (n=16) and 4 mg (n=15) of lusutrombopag administered for up to 7 days. The primary 
endpoint was defined as avoidance of preprocedural platelet transfusion. In this small trial, efficacy was 
not unequivocally separated by lusutrombopag dose level, although a trend to a higher platelet response 
and a longer duration of this response could be observed for the 3 and 4 mg dose. Comparable robust 
efficacy over placebo was noted for both the 3 and 4 mg dose. However, due to safety considerations and 
the desire to avoid excessive platelet count increases with potential thrombotic complications, the 3 mg 
dose was finally carried forward into the phase III trials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018

A lusutrombopag 3-mg/day dose was evaluated versus (vs) placebo in 2 Phase III studies M0631 and 
M0634. The phase IIIb trial M0633 investigated retreatment with lusutrombopag and if omitting the 
stopping criterion and administering a fixed 7-day course of treatment were safe and feasible.

Treatments 
A 3-mg tablet of S-888711 or a matching placebo tablet was administered orally once daily. The duration 
of the study treatment was 7 days.  
Administration of the study drug on Day 2 was performed at 12 hours or longer after administration on 
Day 1. The study drugs were administered at the same time of the days between Days 2 and 7 to the 
extent possible.  
Platelet count on Day 5 to 7 had to be measured before the administration on respective days and the 
study drug was to be administered after confirming that the platelet count measured on that day did not 
meet the following withdrawal criterion: platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL with an increase of ≥ 20,000/μL from 
baseline 
Invasive Procedures 
Planned  invasive  procedure  was  performed  between  Days  9  and  14.  In  case  patients  met  any  of  the 
following  conditions,  the  need  for  the  invasive  procedure  was  determined to  ensure  the  safety  of  the 
patient: 
1. Platelet count reached ≥ 200,000/μL. 
2. Antithrombotic drug was administered. 
3.  AEs,  which  led  the  investigator  or  sub-investigator  to  consider  that  the  procedure  should  not  be 
performed, occurred. 
4. Other problems, which led the investigator or sub-investigator to consider that the procedure should be 
cancelled, occurred. 
5. A patient requested to cancel the procedure after the start of the study. 
In case that the invasive procedure was not performed between Days 9 and 14 because of meeting items 
1 to 4 above, the procedure was allowed to perform after Day 15. In case that the effectiveness of the 
invasive procedure performed between Days 9 and 14 was considered to be insufficient, same procedures 
were allowed to additionally perform after Day 15. 
Determination of the Need for Preoperative Platelet Transfusion 
The  need  for  preoperative  platelet  transfusion,  prior  to  the  initial  invasive  procedure  (ie,  the  primary 
invasive procedure in the study for the patient), was determined based on platelet count measured after 
Day 8 and immediately before performing the invasive procedure (ie, within 2 days before the day of the 
invasive procedure). Preoperative platelet transfusion was performed only when the platelet count was < 
50,000/μL. 
The date of platelet measurement used for determining the need for platelet transfusion, measured value, 
date of transfusion, dose (units) transfused, and reason for platelet transfusion performed during the 
study were recorded on the CRF.

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
• 
To evaluate the superiority of S-888711 over placebo in efficacy in thrombocytopenic patients 
with chronic liver disease receiving 3 mg of S-888711 as a pre-treatment of invasive procedures 
based  on  the  proportion  of  patients  who  required  no  platelet  transfusion  prior  to  invasive 
procedures. 
Secondary Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To  compare  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  pharmacokinetics  of  S-888711  with  those  of  placebo  in 
thrombocytopenic  patients  with  chronic  liver  disease  receiving  3  mg  of  S-888711  as  a 
pretreatment of invasive procedures based on the following variables: 
Proportion of patients who required no platelet transfusion during the study 
Proportion of patients who had a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL with an increase of ≥ 20,000/μL

Sample size 
The target sample size of this study was 45 per the treatment group (90 in total) considering 2 key points 
shown below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 64/142 
 
 
 
• 
To assure at least 90% power in the efficacy evaluation of S-888711: Since the proportion of 
patients who required no platelet transfusion prior to invasive procedure was 20.0% in placebo 
and 81.3% in 3-mg groups in Study 1208M0626, it was assumed that similar results would be 
obtained  in  this  study  but  the  minimumrequired proportion  would  be 70% in  clinical  practice. 
Based  on  the  assumption,  24  patients  per  group  was  required  to  detect  the  difference  in  the 
proportion between placebo and S-888711 groups, with 90% or higher power at significance level 
0.05 (2-sided). Incidentally, the power is higher than 99% with sample size of 45 per group. 
• 
To minimize the risk of overlooking thrombosis-related AEs: The incidence of thrombosis-related 
AEs was 6.5% (3/46 patients) in Study 1208M0626. Based on the result, at least 45 per group is 
required to reduce the probability that this study cannot detect AEs with incidence of 6.5% to less 
than 5%.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to either of the treatment groups (3 mg of S-888711 or placebo) in a ratio of 
1:1. The patients were randomized by using a stochastic minimization method for balancing the following 
2 factors by the registration center: 
• 
• 
Primary invasive procedure (liver ablation/coagulation or other invasive procedures) 
platelet counts at screening (< 35,000/μL, ≥ 35,000/μL to < 45,000/μL, or ≥ 45,000/μL) 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion by using a placebo matching the active drug canisters 
in appearance, labelling, and packaging. Study drug assignment was performed by block randomization 
for  4  patients  in  each  block.  Prior  to  study  drug  assignment,  the  person  responsible  for  study  drug 
assignment generated random numbers using random number generation function RANUNI of SAS®, 
transferred  them  from  SAS  to  Microsoft  Excel,  and  prepared  the  allocation  table  using  Visual  Basic 
program in Microsoft Excel. A total of 640 subjects (320 subjects each for the 3-mg group and the placebo 
group) were assigned to 160 cohorts by the person responsible for allocation.  
Of the allocated study drugs, one set was used for assessment of indistinguishability, and another set was 
provided to the regulatory authority at the end of the study (before blind was broken). A total of 104 sets 
of study drugs were supplied to each medical institution (81 centers), and 54 sets were not used. 
The person responsible for study drug assignment verified indistinguishability from the point of view such 
as the appearance, shape, and smell prior to study drug allocation and after completion of administration 
to all patients (before scheduled unblinding) according to a separate document. In the verification after 
completion of administration to all patients, it was performed from the point of view such as the packaging 
and labelling. No problem was identified in the indistinguishability of study drugs at specified time points. 
The person responsible for study drug assignment kept the randomization table in a sealed envelope until 
scheduled unblinding. The Shionogi emergency center kept the emergency codes. 
The  investigator  or  the  independent  safety  committee  did  not  require  unblinding.  However,  a  patient 
experienced  a  portal  vein  thrombosis  as  a  suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  reaction.  Since  the 
pharmacovigilance division which was independent of the developmental divisions of the sponsor had to 
judge whether they reported it to the regulatory authorities, they required unblinding of this patient to the 
Shionogi emergency centre. The patient was revealed to be the 3-mg group; therefore, the information 
that this SAE occurred in the 3-mg group was notified to the regulatory authorities, all the investigators, 
and the IRBs of the medical institutions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 65/142 
 
 
 
The person responsible for study drug assignment opened the randomization table after all data from 
CRFs  were  locked.  Plasma  drug  concentrations  were  reported  to  the  sponsor  after  the  database  was 
locked because the treatment assignment could be identified. Blinding was maintained during the study 
except  for  the  above  mentioned  case  for  all  the  persons  related  the  study  except  for  the  person 
responsible for study drug assignment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Population 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received at least 1 study drug and 
had a measurement of platelet counts at baseline and at least 1 measurement of platelet counts 
after the initiation of study drug administration. 
•  Safety analysis population included all randomized patients who received at least 1 actual dose of 
the study drug. The population was analyzed according to the treatment that the patients actually 
received, rather than the treatment to which the patients were randomized. 
• 
Per protocol set (PPS) included all randomized patients included in FAS and did not meet any of 
the following conditions: 
o  Patients with any protocol inclusion or exclusion violations 
o  Patients with insufficient treatment compliance of the study drug 
o  Patients with violations of restrictions on concomitant therapy 
• 
Pharmacokinetic  concentration  population  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  1  actual 
dose  of  S-888711  and  had  at  least  1  measurement  of  plasma  S-  888711  concentration.  This 
population was used for the concentration listing and plasma concentration-time profile graphing. 
Handling of Missing Data 
Missing data was not imputed. All analyses were done using actual observations.  
Analysis of primary efficacy endpoints 
As the primary analysis, the proportion of patients who required no platelet transfusion prior to invasive 
procedure  (ie,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint)  was  calculated  in  each  treatment  group  and  its  95% 
confidence interval for incidence was calculated by using Clopper-Pearson method. The proportion was 
compared  between  the  3-mg  group  and  the  placebo  group  with  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test  with 
consideration  of  stratification  factors  (ie,  platelet  count  at  screening  and  planned  primary  invasive 
procedure). The relative risk of the 3-mg group compared with the placebo group and its 95% confidence 
interval were calculated. As a sensitive analysis, the same statistical analysis was performed for the PPS. 
Statistical analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint: 
• 
The proportion of patients who required no platelet transfusion prior to invasive procedure and its 
95%  confidence  interval  were  calculated  by  each  stratification  factor,  ie,  platelet  count  at 
screening and planned primary invasive procedure in each treatment group. 
•  Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  the  following  categories  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
S-888711  3  mg  in  those  subgroups.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  required  no  platelet 
transfusion prior to invasive procedure was calculated by each category in each treatment group, 
Assessment report

Page 66/142 
 
 
 
 
 
and each relative risk of the 3-mg group compared with the placebo group and its 95% confidence 
interval were calculated. The interaction between each subgroup and the treatment group was 
tested with Breslow-Day test. 
–  Performed invasive procedure (percutaneous RFA/MCT or other invasive procedures) 
–  Performed detailed invasive procedure (only for the proportion of patients who required 
no platelet transfusion prior to invasive procedure) (percutaneous RFA/MCT, laparoscopic 
RFA/MCT, EVL, EIS, TACE, TAE, or other invasive procedures) 
–  Baseline platelet count (< 35,000/μL, ≥ 35,000/μL to < 45,000/μL, or ≥ 45,000/μL) 
–  Child-Pugh (A or B) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed as follows: 
• 
Proportion of patients requiring no platelet transfusion, frequency of platelet transfusion and dose 
(unit) transfused during the study  
•  Responder rate  
•  Duration of maintenance of increase in platelet count 
• 
Time course of platelet count

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who required no platelet transfusion prior to invasive 
procedure  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who  required  no  preoperative  platelet 
transfusion) and defined as the proportion of patients who received no platelet transfusion prior to the 
primary invasive procedure in respective analysis population.  
The proportion of patients who required no preoperative platelet transfusion was 79.2% (38/48 patients) 
in the 3-mg group and 12.5% (6/48 patients) in the placebo group; the proportion in the 3-mg group was 
significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P <0.0001).

Time Course of Platelet Count 
The mean (range) maximum platelet count in patients without platelet transfusion was 9.02 (5.9 to 14.5) 
× 104/μL and the mean (range) time to reach the maximum platelet count was 13.4 days (6 to 28 days) 
in the 3-mg group. The mean maximum platelet count in patients with platelet transfusion was 6.85 × 
104/μL in the 3-mg group and 5.28 × 104/μL in the placebo group.  
The mean changes in platelet count were 1.67 × 104/μL immediately after transfusion (on the day of 
transfusion), 1.34 × 104/μL 1 day after transfusion, and 0.70 × 104/μL 2 days after transfusion in the 
placebo group; increments in platelet count after transfusion were small and short in duration. All the 10 
patients who were withdrawn from the study treatment (8 in the 3-mg group and 2 in the placebo group) 
met the criteria for withdrawal (platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL with an increase of ≥ 20,000/μL from baseline). 
The maximum platelet count in these patients was 14.0 × 104/μL in the 3-mg group and 7.3 × 104/μL in 
the placebo group, indicating no excessive increase.

Treatments 
A 3-mg tablet of lusutrombopag or a matching placebo tablet was to be administered orally once daily. 
Study drug was to be administered for up to 7 days. Administration of the study drug on Day 2 was to be 
performed ≥ 12 hours after administration on Day 1. 
On subsequent days, study drug was to be administered at the same time of the day to the extent 
possible. On Days 5, 6, and 7, the platelet count was to be measured before administration of study drug; 
if a subject met the administration stopping criterion (ie, platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L with an increase of 
≥ 20 × 109/L from baseline), no additional dose of study drug was to be administered. 
Invasive Procedure 
The planned invasive procedure was to be performed in the posttreatment period between Days 9 and 14. 
The need for the invasive procedure was to be reassessed in the event of the following: 
• 
Platelet count ≥ 200 × 109/L 
•  Administration of an antithrombotic drug

The subject requested cancellation of the invasive procedure after randomization  
If any of the above criteria was met and the invasive procedure could not be performed between Days 9 
and 14, it was permitted to be performed up to Day 35. If a subject did not undergo a procedure, all 
relevant follow-up assessments were to be performed and data collected up to Day 35. If the invasive 
procedure performed between Days 9 and 14 needed to be repeated, the same procedure could be 
performed after Day 15 at the discretion of the investigator.

CLD who are undergoing elective invasive procedures. 
Secondary Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of S-888711 treatment compared with placebo 
To assess the platelet response following treatment with S-888711 compared with placebo 
To assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) and PK of S-888711 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior to the 
primary invasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomization through 7 days after 
the primary invasive procedure.

• 
• 
Proportion of Subjects Who Required No Platelet Transfusion During the Study

Sample size 
Two hundred subjects with CLD and thrombocytopenia who were scheduled to undergo elective invasive 
procedures were planned to be randomized to either of 2 treatment groups (100 subjects per group). 
In the Phase 3 study (Study M0631) conducted in Japan, the proportion of subjects who required no 
platelet transfusion prior to the primary invasive procedure was 79.2% in the lusutrombopag 3-mg dose 
group and 12.5% in the placebo group. The difference in the proportion of subjects was 66.7% (95% CI: 
51.9%, 81.5%). Based on these results, a target of a 50% difference between the lusutrombopag and 
placebo groups was selected for the current study. Assuming that the proportion of subjects who met the 
primary endpoint was 20% in the placebo group and 70% in the lusutrombopag group, 100 subjects per 
group provided 99% power to detect a difference of 50% between lusutrombopag and placebo groups at 
a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. For the safety analysis, 100 subjects per group assured that there was 
at least a 95% probability of detecting AEs with an incidence of 3% or more.subjects per group). 
Randomisation 
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lusutrombopag 3 mg or placebo using the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 80/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IVRS/IWRS. Randomization was stratified by the primary invasive procedure and the platelet count at 
baseline as follows: 
• 
• 
Primary invasive procedure: liver ablation/coagulation or other invasive procedures 
Platelet count at baseline: < 35 × 109/L or ≥ 35 × 109/L 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was to be conducted in a double-blind manner using a placebo matching the active drug in 
appearance, labelling, and packaging. An IVRS/IWRS was to be used for central subject randomization 
and study drug assignment. The IVRS/IWRS was to assign study drug identifiers according to a 
randomization schedule. The randomization scheme and medication identification (Card No.) number 
schedule were generated by the IVRS/IWRS vendor. 
All subjects, the investigator, and study site and Shionogi personnel were to be blinded to the treatment 
assigned at randomization until database lock. The randomization schedule was to be kept confidential 
and was not to be accessible to anyone until unblinding, except for the sponsor’s drug supply 
management staff, IVRS/IWRS clinical coordinator(s), IVRS/IWRS vendor staff, unblinded statisticians on 
the DSMB, and Drug Safety personnel reporting suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, as 
required by local regulation. 
Unblinding at the investigator’s request was to occur only in the event of an emergency or an AE where 
details of the treatment assigned were required to determine an appropriate course of therapy. Prior to 
unblinding, and if the situation allowed it, the investigator was to contact the sponsor in order to obtain 
additional information about the investigational product. If this was impractical, the investigator or 
qualified designee was to follow the process for obtaining the treatment assignment from the IVRS/IWRS 
system, and was to notify the sponsor of the unblinding as soon as possible without revealing the 
treatment assignment of that subject. The investigator was to document the subject identification 
number and the date and time of breaking the blind, as well as the reason the blind was broken. 
Since treatment assignment could have been determined from plasma drug concentrations, these data 
were to be reported to the sponsor after database lock. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
• 
• 
Intention-to-treat (ITT) Population: includes all randomized subjects. Subjects were analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they were randomized. This population was the primary 
population for the analysis of efficacy. 
Per-protocol (PP) Population: includes all randomized subjects who had nomajor protocol 
deviations pertaining to the efficacy evaluation. Deviations weredetermined prior to unblinding of 
the study data. This population was used in asensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint. 
•  Safety Population: includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study 
drug. This population was analyzed according to the treatment that subjects actually received, 
rather than the treatment to which they were randomized. This population was the primary 
population for the analysis of safety. 
Primary Endpoint Analysis 
The number and proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior to the primary invasive 
procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from the date of randomization through 7 days after the 
primary invasive procedure were summarized by treatment group, along with 95% confidence intervals

(CIs) calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. The treatment groups were compared using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusted using the stratification factors of platelet count at 
randomization (< 35 × 109/L, ≥ 35 × 109/L) and the planned primary invasive procedure (liver 
ablation/coagulation, other invasive procedure). 
Differences in the primary endpoint and 95% CIs were also calculated using the Wald method. 
Secondary Endpoint Analysis 
A gatekeeping procedure was employed for sequentially testing the important secondary endpoints, 
identified as the most clinically relevant endpoints. If the primary endpoint was statistically significant, 
the secondary endpoints were tested at the 0.05 level (2-sided) in sequence. Sequential testing for the 
secondary endpoints was conducted in the following order: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The comparison between lusutrombopag and placebo of the number and proportion of subjects 
who required no platelet transfusion during the study (using the CMH test adjusted by the 
stratification factors) 
The comparison between lusutrombopag and placebo of the number and proportion of 
responders: subjects who achieved a platelet count of ≥ 50 × 109/L, with an increase of ≥ 20 × 
109/L from baseline at any time during the study (using the CMH test adjusted by the 
stratification factors) 
The comparison between lusutrombopag and placebo of the duration of platelet count ≥ 50 × 
109/L (using the van Elteren test stratified with platelet transfusion during the study) 
The comparison between lusutrombopag without platelet transfusion and placebo with platelet 
transfusion of the duration of platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L (using the Wilcoxon rank sum test)

Proportion of Subjects who Required Rescue Therapy 
No subjects in the lusutrombopag group received rescue therapy for bleeding events compared to 2/107 
subjects (1.9%) in the placebo group: 
 - one patient underwent polypectomy as the primary invasive procedure, received platelet transfusion as 
rescue therapy for large intestinal hemorrhage that started on Day 10. 
 - one patient underwent mastoidectomy plus tympanoplasty as the primary invasive procedure, received 
platelet transfusion and red blood cells as rescue therapy for ear hemorrhage that started on Day 12. 
Frequency of Platelet Transfusion and Dose Transfused During the Study 
Fewer subjects in the lusutrombopag group than in the placebo group received platelet transfusion during 
the study (34 [31.5%] vs. 73 [68.2%]).  
Furthermore, in the lusutrombopag group, all of the subjects receiving platelet transfusion (n = 34) 
received only a single platelet transfusion. In the placebo group, 61/73 subjects received a single platelet 
transfusion; 12 subjects required multiple platelet transfusions, including 6 subjects who received 2 
platelet transfusions , 5 subjects who received 3 platelet transfusions, and 1 subject who received 5 
platelet transfusions.

Trial M0633 
Methods 
The study was conducted in the following 3 groups (the A/B-1 group, the A/B-2 group, and the non-naive 
A/B group) (see Table 16). Patients who had received S-888711 previously were assigned to the 
non-naive A/B group. Patients who had not previously received S-888711 were enrolled in the A/B-1 
group or the A/B-2 group. In each group, the study treatment was stopped as shown in the table below. 
This rule was termed “the platelet-related criteria for stopping the study treatment”. Of the A/B-1 and 
A/B-2 groups, the patient recruitment started with the A/B-1 group (Step 1). When the number of 
patients who had experienced platelet count of ≥ 200,000/μL was less than 2 in the A/B-1 group, which 
consists of the target sample size of 45 patients (see Section 9.1.2), the A/B-2 group (Step 2) could be 
initiated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 91/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aside from the non-naive A/B group, patients treated in the A/B-1 group or the A/B-2 group could be 
retreated with S-888711 during the Post-treatment Period, provided platelet count was < 50,000/μL, an 
additional invasive procedure was determined to be necessary, and there was no portal vein thrombosis 
based on imaging evaluation performed between 3 and 10 days after the previous invasive procedure 
(see Section 9.4.1). The retreatment was initiated between Days 14 and 35 and continued up to 7 days 
with the original patient ID in the group in which the patient had been enrolled initially. The day of the 
initial retreatment was counted as Day 1 of the retreatment. The same study procedures followed during 
the Treatment Period and Post-treatment Period of the first treatment was repeated, and the additional 
invasive procedure was performed on Day 9 to 14 of the retreatment (the day of the initial retreatment 
was counted as Day 1 of the retreatment). 
Table 16: Treatment groups:
The stopping criterion was applied on Day 6 only in Group A/B-1;  
• 
• 
not at all in the Group A/B-2 in which subjects were treated for a fixed 7 days;  
and on Days 3, 5, 6, and 7 in non-naive Group A/B.  
In addition, study treatment was to be stopped if a platelet count increase of > 40,000/μL from baseline 
was observed on Days 5, 6, or 7 in Groups A/B-1 and A/B-2 or on Days 3, 5, 6 , or 7 in the non-naive 
Group A/B.

Treatments 
A 3-mg tablet of S-888711 was administered orally once daily. The duration of the study treatment was 
up to 7 days (Day 1 to 7). Administration of the study drug on Day 2 was performed at 12 hours or longer 
after administration on Day 1. The study drugs were administered at the same time of the days between 
Days 2 and 7 to the extent possible. 
Rescue Therapy 
The use of the following therapies was permitted only with the following restrictions. 
• 
Platelet preparation 
Platelet preparation was permitted only when bleeding-related AEs occurred regardless of platelet count. 
•  Antithrombotic 
Antithrombotic drugs were allowed to be administered only when a platelet count was ≥ 200,000/μL or 
thrombus formation was highly suspected.

Invasive Procedure 
Planned invasive procedure was performed between Days 9 and 14. If patients met any of the following 
criteria, the need for the invasive procedure was re-assessed to ensure the safety of the patient: 
1. Platelet count reached ≥ 200,000/μL. 
2. Antithrombotic drug was administered. 
3. AEs, which led the investigator or sub-investigator to consider that the procedure should not be 
performed, occurred. 
4. Other problems, which led the investigator or sub-investigator to consider that the procedure should 
not be performed, occurred. 
5. A patient requested to cancel the procedure after the start of the study. 
If the invasive procedure was not performed between Days 9 and 14 because any of criteria 1 to 4 above 
were met and the need for the additional invasive procedure was determined after Day 15, the procedure 
was allowed to be performed after Day 15. The additional invasive procedure was limited to the same 
primary invasive procedures as initially allowed. 
In the patient retreated with S-888711 during the Post-treatment Period, the additional invasive 
procedure was performed between Days 9 and 14 of the retreatment. 
Determination of the Need for Pre-operative Platelet Transfusion 
The need for preoperative platelet transfusion prior to the initial invasive procedure (ie, the primary 
invasive procedure in the study for the patient) was determined based on platelet count measured after 
Day 8 and immediately before performing the invasive procedure (ie, within 2 days before the day of the 
invasive procedure). Preoperative platelet transfusion was performed only when the platelet count was < 
50,000/μL. If patients retreated with S-888711 during the Post treatment Period underwent an additional 
invasive procedure, the need for preoperative platelet transfusion similarly was determined based on 
platelet count measured after Day 8 of the retreatment and immediately before performing the invasive 
procedure (ie, within 2 days before the day of the invasive procedure). 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To assess the significance of platelet count measurement during administration of S-888711 to 
thrombocytopenic patients with CLD receiving S-888711 as a pre-treatment of invasive procedures 
Secondary Objectives 
−  To evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy of S-888711 in thrombocytopenic patients with CLD receiving 
S-888711 as a pre-treatment of invasive procedures  
−  To evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy of S-888711 in thrombocytopenic patients with CLD receiving 
S-888711 among patients who have previously received S-888711 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Variable 
The efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who required no platelet transfusion:  
−  Proportion of Patients who Required No Platelet Transfusion Prior to the Initial Invasive Procedure 
−  Proportion of Patients who Required No Platelet Transfusion until 7 Days after the Primary

Duration of the increase in platelet count,  
Time course of platelet count and frequency of platelet transfusion and  
Dose (unit) transfused. 
Sample size 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the frequency of platelet count measurement during 
administration of S-888711, that is, to assess the time point of platelet count measurement when the 
withdrawal criterion (platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL with an increase of ≥ 20,000/μL from baseline during 
the study treatment) should be applied. The confirmatory phase 3 study (1304M0631) was conducted 
under the study treatment using the withdrawal criterion based on platelet counts measured on Day 5 to 
7 in patients with Child-Pugh class A or B. The target sample size of Study 1304M0631 was 45 patients per 
group. Therefore, the target sample size of 45 patients per group (90 patients in total of A/B-1 and A/B-2 
groups) is needed to assess the efficacy and the safety with the same precision as Study 1304M0631. 
In addition, for patients with Child-Pugh class A or B who have previously received S-888711, the target 
sample size of 5 patients was considered feasible. 
Table 17: Summary of proportion of responders by time point (FAS) 
Randomisation 
The study was conducted in the following 3 groups (the A/B-1 group, the A/B-2 group, and the non-naive 
A/B group) (see Table 16). Patients who had received S-888711 previously were assigned to the 
non-naive A/B group. Patients who had not previously received S-888711 were enrolled in the A/B-1 
group or the A/B-2 group. In each group, the study treatment was stopped as shown in the table below. 
This rule was termed “the platelet-related criteria for stopping the study treatment”. Of the A/B-1 and 
A/B-2 groups, the patient recruitment started with the A/B-1 group (Step 1). When the number of 
patients who had experienced platelet count of ≥ 200,000/μL was less than 2 in the A/B-1 group, which 
consists of the target sample size of 45 patients (see Section 9.1.2), the A/B-2 group (Step 2) could be 
initiated.

Blinding (masking) 
Neither patients nor investigators were blinded towards the assigned treatment regimen.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets: 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) included all enrolled patients who received at least 1 study drug and had a 
measurement of platelet counts at baseline and at least 1 measurement of platelet counts after 
the initiation of study drug administration. 
•  Safety analysis population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drug. 
• 
PK concentration population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of S-888711 and 
had at least 1 measurement of plasma S-888711 concentration. This population was used for the 
concentration listing, calculation of summary statistics, and plasma concentration-time profile 
graphing. 
• 
PK parameter population includes all patients with at least 1 pharmacokinetic parameter of 
S-888711 estimated appropriately. This population was used for S-888711 PK parameter listing 
and summary. This population was also used for the statistical analysis. 
The FAS was used as the efficacy analysis population. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
Proportion of Patients who Required no Platelet Transfusion 
The number and proportion of patients who required no platelet transfusion were summarized by 
treatment group, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using the Clopper-Pearson 
method. If patient was withdrawn from the study during the treatment period and did not undergo 
invasive procedure, the patient was to be considered as treatment failure, ie, the patient who required 
platelet transfusion. 
Responder Rate 
The number and proportion (with 95% CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method) of responders during the 
study and at each scheduled time point were calculated by treatment group. The patient was considered 
as non-responder if their platelet count met the responder criterion only after the first platelet 
transfusion. 
Duration of the Increase in Platelet Count 
The duration of the increase in platelet count was calculated based on scheduled time points. Details of 
the calculation are provided in the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9). Summary statistics for the duration of 
increased platelet count were calculated by treatment group in patients who received or did not receive 
platelet transfusions. 
Time Course of Platelet Count 
Summary statistics were provided for platelet count at each scheduled time point by treatment group. 
The change in platelet count from baseline, the percent change in platelet count from baseline, maximum 
platelet count and maximum change in platelet count for each patient were also summarized by 
treatment group. In addition, the number and proportion of patients with a decreased platelet count 
compared to baseline value at the end of the study were summarized by treatment group. For patients 
who required no platelet transfusion, the time point of the maximum platelet count was summarized by 
treatment group.

Integrated Summary of Effectiveness for Lusutrombopag 
The provided integrated analysis summarizes the efficacy of lusutrombopag in 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies: 
study 1304M0631 and study 1423M0634. These studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies designed to assess the efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily 
for at least 4 days and up to 7 days for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver 
disease (CLD) who are undergoing elective invasive procedures. These studies were conducted under a 
similar study design and included 3 periods: a screening period up to 28 days, a treatment period of up to 
7 days, and a posttreatment period of 28 days. 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population was defined as all randomized subjects and was the analysis 
population for the ISE. Subjects were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were 
randomized. 
In principle, summary statistics, including the number, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, and minimum and maximum values, were calculated for continuous variables. The number and 
proportion of subjects in each category were calculated for categorical variables. 
All analyses ware performed using SAS Version 9.2. Statistical tests were performed at a 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. There was no adjustment for multiplicity. 
There were 6 main objectives and related analyses, which were presented below: 
1.  Proportion of Subjects Who Required No Platelet Transfusion Prior to the Primary Invasive 
Procedure and No Rescue Therapy for Bleeding from Randomization Through 7 Days After the 
Primary Invasive Procedure 
2.  Proportion of Subjects Who Required No Platelet Transfusion Prior to the Primary Invasive 
Procedure 
3.  Proportion of Subjects Who Required No Platelet Transfusion During the Study 
4.  Proportion of Responders during the Study 
5.  Duration of the Increase in Platelet Count to at Least 50,000/ěL

Figure 15: Difference in Proportion of Subjects Who Required No Platelet Transfusion Prior to 
the Primary Invasive Procedure and No Rescue Therapy for Bleeding from Randomization 
Through 7 Days After the Primary Invasive Procedure (Pivotal Phase 3 Studies) 
Intent-to-treat Population 
Across Studies M0631 and M0634, the proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior 
to the primary invasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomization through 7 days 
after the primary invasive procedure was significantly greater in the pooled lusutrombopag group (68.2% 
[107 of 157 subjects]) compared with the pooled placebo group (23.9% [37 of 155 subjects]) (p < 
0.0001).  
A similar trend was observed in each of the individual studies; however, a greater treatment difference for 
this endpoint was observed in Study M0631 (61.8%) compared with Study M0634 (36.6%). One reason 
that may account for this is the high number of protocol deviations related to platelet transfusions that 
favored the placebo group in Study M0634. Specifically, this would have an impact on the analysis using 
the ITT population, as the analysis included 3 subjects in the lusutrombopag group and 10 subjects in the 
placebo group who did not receive a platelet transfusion but should have (preprocedural platelet counts < 
50,000/ěL), as well as 5 subjects in the lusutrombopag group, but 0 subjects in the placebo group who 
received a platelet transfusion but should not have (preprocedural platelet counts ≥ 50,000/ěL).  
These effects were minimized in the analysis using the PP population, which excluded subjects with 
protocol deviations pertaining to platelet transfusions, and thus, relative to the ITT population, the 
proportion of subjects who met the primary endpoint increased in the lusutrombopag group and 
decreased in the placebo group, increasing the overall treatment effect (72.5% vs 20.2%; p < 0.0001). 
There are noticeable differences in outcome defined as "Proportion of Subjects Who Required No Platelet 
Transfusion Prior to the Primary Invasive Procedure and No Rescue Therapy for Bleeding from 
Randomization Through 7 Days after Primary Invasive Procedure" between age groups (<65, ≥65 and 
<75, ≥75) and Child-Pugh classes. However, in light of the PK/PD analyses, the relatively low numbers of 
subjects in some categories is not considered clinically important. Furthermore, supplementary data from 
post-marketing and post- marketing surveillance are reassuring.

This side by side comparison of the two pivotal trials reveals that in the Japanese study M0631, a 
substantially higher percentage of subjects could reach the endpoint ‘no transfusion before primary 
invasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding through 7 days after the invasive procedure’; ie. 
75.5% vs. 64,8%. This outcome measure was defined as the primary endpoint for multinational pivotal 
trial M0634 and calculated post hoc for trial M0631. 
The endpoint ‘no transfusion before primary invasive procedure’, which served as the primary endpoint in 
M0631 and a secondary endpoint in M0634, could be reached by 77.6% of patients in this study but only 
64.8% of patients in the multinational trial M0634. 
In all Japanese trials, an effect of about 80% with regard to this outcome measure was observed, 
regardless if the dose of lusutrombopag was 2, 2.5, 3 or 4 mg administered up to 7 days. The effect 
observed in the multinational pivotal trial did noticeably differ from this trend. As dose finding was 
undertaken in Japanese subjects only, it is of concern that the selected dose of 3 mg could be 
underperforming in Caucasian patients. The applicant was asked to comment on this and to submit 
efficacy results stratified by weight groups for the two pivotal trials, i.e. 40-<50kg, 50-<60kg, 60-<70kg 
etc. In an analysis of pooled data from Studies M0631 and M0634, subjects above ≥ 100 kg body weight 
were grouped together, and those below 100 kg were grouped by body weight quartiles (from minimum 
body weight to < 100). The applicant chose these cuts so as to have a meaningful number of subjects in 
each dose group: use of the smaller 10-kg cuts suggested would have led to very low numbers in weight 
groups and thus made drawing conclusions more difficult. The minimum weight in the <100 kg group was

34.9 kg, Q1 was 58.9, median = 69.0, and Q3 = 80.1. Reassuringly, differences in body weight did not 
lead to clinically relevant differences in platelet responses in these cut-off strata. 
Conversely, the percentage of responders before day 7 was 16.3% in the Japanese trial and at 27.8% 
nearly double that figure in the multinational trial M0634. The applicant was asked to comment on that 
discrepancy with regard to efficacy outcomes in Japanese and Caucasian patients. A noticeably higher 
proportion of subjects in the international trial M0634 did not need a full 7 day course of lusutrombopag 
but met the stopping /responder criterion in comparison to the Japanese trial M0631. Demographic 
characteristics were very comparable between the two studies, apart from race and bodyweight.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-finding was done in three phase II trials in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh Class A or 
B and severe thrombocytopenia planned to undergo percutaneous liver ablation. Open-label, 
non-controlled trials M0623 and M0625 evaluated lusutrombopag at doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 mg for 
up to 7 days (M0623) and at doses of 2.5, 3, or 4 mg for up to 7 days (M0625). In trial M0623 it was 
observed that doses below 2 mg did not show an appreciable impact on platelet counts. In trial M0625, 
the investigated doses of 2.5 mg (n=6), 3 mg (n=7) and 4 mg (n=8) lead to efficacy responses in these 
limited patient numbers. 
The double-blind, parallel-group, placebo (n=15) controlled trial M0626 investigated doses of 2 mg 
(n=15), 3 mg (n=16) and 4 mg (n=15) of lusutrombopag administered for up to 7 days. The primary 
endpoint was defined as avoidance of pre-procedural platelet transfusion. In this small trial, efficacy was 
not unequivocally separated by lusutrombopag dose level, although a trend to a higher platelet response 
and a longer duration of this response could be observed for the 3 and 4 mg dose. Comparable robust 
efficacy over placebo was noted for both the 3 and 4 mg dose. However, due to safety considerations and 
the desire to avoid excessive platelet count increases with potential thrombotic complications, the 3 mg 
dose was finally carried forward into the phase III trials. 
Two pivotal, double-blind, randomized clinical trials investigated the superiority of 3 mg lusutrombopag 
administered daily for up to 7 days over placebo. In these trials, invasive procedures other than liver 
ablation were allowed, but excluded any of the following situations: laparotomy, thoracotomy, 
craniotomy, open-heart surgery, organ resection, or partial organ resection. Trial M0631 enrolled 97 
Japanese subjects and trial M0634 enrolled 215 subjects mainly of Caucasian background.  
Sample size targets for trials M0631 and M0634 were chosen to obtain adequate power to meet the 
primary objective but also to have adequate sensitivity to detect common (incidence >3%) safety events 
(e.g. thrombotic events). Randomized treatment assignment in studies M0631 and M0634 was stratified 
by type of primary invasive procedure and baseline platelet count.

According to the main exclusion criteria in the phase III studies, patients with past or present thrombosis 
(e.g., cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein 
thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome) were not enrolled. However, this large 
group of patients should not be excluded from treatment and a detailed statement in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC covers all at risk groups and is deemed sufficient to alert the treating physician to a potentially 
increased risk of thrombotic or thromboembolic events. 
The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects who received no pre-procedural platelet 
transfusion in trial M0631 and as the proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior to 
the primary invasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomization through 7 days 
after the primary elective procedure in study M0634. In addition, a number of informative and clinically 
relevant secondary endpoints were collected (i.e. proportion of subjects who received no platelet 
transfusion during the study; number of days during which the platelet count was ≥ 50,000/ěL; time 
course of platelet count; number of platelet transfusions).  
In terms of statistical analysis both trials were planned in a similar fashion. However, slight differences 
between the two trials regarding the specification of the analysis populations and the way that missing 
data were handled were noticed. This may have contributed to differences between treatment effect 
estimates obtained for the two studies. The primary efficacy analysis in either of the two trials was 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test which takes into account the predefined stratification 
factors. Confidence intervals of platelet transfusion rates per treatment arm were estimated using the 
Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals which have been shown to provide conservative control of the 
coverage probability even for stratified designs. Finally, the applicant provided updated estimates of the 
confidence intervals for differences in transfusion rates between treatment arms using a procedure which 
has been shown to provide improved coverage probability compared to the originally planned procedure. 
Corresponding estimates are very close to those obtained originally. Consequently effect size estimates 
and corresponding confidence intervals can be considered robust with respect to the underlying statistical 
assumptions. 
In all of these trials, lusutrombopag administration was titrated until the responder criterion = stopping 
criterion (platelet count ≥50.000 and increase over baseline of ≥20.000) was met or up to a maximum of 
7 days. Platelet count on Day 5 to 7 had to be measured before the administration on respective days, and 
if the responder criterion was met, treatment was stopped. Hence not all subjects received a full course 
of 7 tablets during these trials. 
The phase IIIb, multicentre, open-label study M0633 in Japanese subjects with CLD and severe 
thrombocytopenia endeavoured to investigate the safety and feasibility of a fixed 7 day duration of 
treatment (arms A/B-1, n=47; A/B-2, n=47) and effects of retreatment with lusutrombopag (arm A/B, 
n=8). The stopping criterion was applied on Day 6 only in Group A/B-1; not at all in the Group A/B-2 in 
which subjects were treated for a fixed 7 days; and on Days 3, 5, 6, and 7 in non-naive Group A/B.  
Trial M0633 was conducted for the purpose of investigating whether a fixed 7 day treatment regimen 
would provide comparable safety and efficacy as the variable length treatment with platelet monitoring 
established in previous studies. For this purpose, however, a type of non-inferiority/equivalence 
comparison would have been ideal. The design of study M0633, however, was not set up to permit 
conclusions of a comparative nature. Most importantly the number of subjects having received a different 
dose than foreseen with the treatment regimen established in previous studies is small.   
In all clinical trials pertaining to dose-finding and efficacy, subjects with chronic liver disease and severe 
thrombocytopenia were enroled, however, patients with splenectomy, concomitant interferon therapy or 
Child-Pugh Class C were consistently excluded.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint in phase III trial M0631 (no transfusion before primary invasive procedure) 
could be reached by 79.2% (CI 65.0, 89.5%) of patients receiving lusutrombopag and 12.5% (CI 4.7, 
25.2%) of placebo recipients in the FAS. In the multinational trial M0634, 64.8% (CI 53.1, 72.1%) of 
patients in the lusutrombopag group and 29.9% (CI 20.6, 38.5%) in the placebo group in the FAS met 
this endpoint, which was defined as a secondary efficacy outcome. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in phase III trial M0634 (no transfusion before primary invasive procedure 
and no rescue therapy for bleeding through 7 days after the invasive procedure) could be reached by 
64.8% (CI 55.0, 73.8%) of subjects in the lusutrombopag group compared to 29.0% (CI 20.6, 38.5%) in 
the placebo group in the FAS. A substantial number of protocol deviations with regards to platelet 
transfusions occurred in trial M0634. In 18 instances, the rules with regards to platelet transfusions were 
disregarded. However, the analysis in the PP population supported a clear beneficial effect of 
lusutrombopag, as 72.5% (CI 62.2, 81.4%) of subjects in the verum vs. 20.2% (CI 12.4, 30.1%) of 
subjects in the placebo group met the primary endpoint. In trial M0631, 75.5% (CI 61.1, 86.7%) of the 
lusutrombopag subjects and 12.5% (CI 4.7, 25.2%) of placebo subjects met this post hoc calculated 
endpoint. This outcome measure is considered to be even more clinically relevant than the primary 
endpoint used in M0631 (proportion of patients who did not need a transfusion before the primary 
invasive procedure), because this endpoint demonstrates the continued protection against bleeding 
events during the healing period. 
Results obtained for the secondary endpoints support the clinical efficacy of lusutrombopag and illustrate 
the size of the increase of platelet counts, the duration of this effect as well as the dramatic reduction in 
need for platelet transfusions. 
Surgical intervention was scheduled in the Post-treatment period between Days 9 and 14. An analysis, 
whether the time between end of treatment (between Days 4 and 7) may have had any influence on the 
efficacy and/or safety of the treatment is missing. The applicant was requested to provide additional 
analysis (for all Phase 3 trials) of the amount of time between end of dosing and surgical intervention 
(distribution, summary statistics, pooled and separate by treatment group, stratification factor) and 
potential association with treatment outcome (platelet counts before procedure, primary and secondary 
outcomes). In the submitted analysis there appeared to be an appreciable interaction between effect of 
treatment and time between last dose of treatment and date of surgical intervention for subjects treated 
with Lusutrombopag Shionogi. Response rates for subjects receiving interventions on Day 3 appear lower 
than for subjects with longer intervals between end of treatment and intervention, which is compatible 
with the notion that platelet production under treatment reaches its peak more than 3 days after 
treatment. No corresponding effect is observed for subjects in the placebo group, which would be 
expected under the assumption of randomly fluctuating platelet counts under placebo treatment. In 
conclusion, an interval of 2 or 3 days between the end of dosing and the invasive procedure is suboptimal 
and should be avoided. However, data provided by the Applicant illustrated that nearly all of those 
patients who successfully avoided a platelet transfusion prior and after their invasive procedure in each 
pivotal trial achieved the desired platelet count at day 9 after start of dosing. In combination with the 
recommendation to check the platelet count before undertaking the elective procedure, this is considered 
sufficient justification to support the statement in section 4.2 of the SmPC in this regard. 
The efficacy outcomes from trial M0633 are comparable to those of trial M0631, with 80.9% of subjects 
in arm A/B-1, 83.0% in A/B-2 and 75% in non-naive A/B requiring no platelet transfusions prior to the 
invasive procedure. However, the applicant was asked to describe in detail the efficacy and safety 
outcomes of those patients who received 7 days of lusutrombopag therapy in arms A/B-1 and A/B2 but 
should have stopped if the safety criterion from the two pivotal trials, i.e. a rise of platelet counts above 
50.000 with an increase of 20.000 were applied on day 5, 6 and 7, as such an in depth analysis of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 118/142 
 
 
 
pertinent issue was missing. From the additional data submitted it appears that there may be an increase 
in response rate with increasing cumulative exposure.  
It is acknowledged that the majority of subjects in clinical studies M0631 and M0634 received 7 days of 
treatment (73%, 113 out of 155), consequently only a minority of subjects who would be exposed to a 
higher dose under a treatment regimen without monitoring. In Study M0633 the number of subjects who 
received a larger dose compared to a treatment regimen with monitoring is limited (i.e. 20) rendering a 
comparative safety analysis whether such patients are exposed to a higher risk of safety events difficult. 
No association between the maximum platelet count and the duration of treatment (with or without 
stopping) is apparent. The presented data indicate a slightly improved efficacy of lusutrombopag at a 
fixed 7-day treatment regimen. Conversely, comparative assessment of safety data is uncertain due to 
the sparsity of data. However, it is considered that the data presented do not implicate a substantial 
safety issue with regard to a 7-day treatment with lusutrombopag without the application of a stopping 
criterion. Furthermore additional monitoring for vulnerable patients (bodyweight <45kg, Child Pugh C) is 
advised in the SmPC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, short-term treatment with lusutrombopag could be an effective new treatment option in 
patients with chronic liver disease and severe thrombocytopenia prior to elective invasive procedures. 
With regards to the proposed indication, the applicant has amended the wording in order to clearly reflect 
that only patients with severe thrombocytopenia were included into the clinical trials. The exclusion 
criteria with regards to the invasive procedures undertaken in the pivotal trials are clearly reflected in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The available data pertaining to patients with the most severe liver disease (Child-Pugh Class C) are 
limited. However, efficacy of lusutrombopag in patients with Child Pugh class C disease is likely to be 
comparable to patients with a lesser grade of liver disease. This notion is supported by the evaluation of 
efficacy in those patients who were included into the clinical development programme or identified in post 
marketing surveillance data from Japan. The warning statements introduced into section 4.4. of the SmPC 
are considered adequate to manage the potential risks in patients with Child Pugh class C liver disease by 
additional monitoring for early signs of worsening or new onset hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and 
thrombotic or bleeding tendency through monitoring of liver function tests, tests used for assessing 
clotting status and through imaging of portal vasculature. Additionally, section 4.4. of the SmPC was 
amended with specific guidance for platelet count monitoring. The inclusion of Child Pugh C in the 
indication and the proposed PASS will ensure further data collection in a systematic way in these patients 
and avoid the highly likely off-label use in this vulnerable population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The applicant submitted a pooled safety analysis for three different data sets: three randomized double 
blind placebo controlled trials (ISS-1: one Phase 2b and two Phase 3), four open-label trials (ISS-2: one 
Phase 1, one phase 2, one phase 3) and all studies including a lusutrombopag 3 mg group (ISS-3). Other 
safety findings are presented by study.  
Separately a summary of the safety of two studies in ITP patients has been presented. Post marketing 
data from Japan have been included in the dossier.

Patient exposure 
653 adult subjects were exposed to lusutrombopag among 20 clinical trials (317 subjects were healthy 
volunteers, dose: 0.1-50 mg). 285 were receiving a dose of 3 mg for up to 7 days (including 273 who 
underwent an invasive procedure).  
343 subjects were included into controlled randomized studies receiving a dose of 3 mg of lusutrombopag 
or placebo (173/170). 108 subjects participating in uncontrolled studies received a treatment dose of 3 
mg lusutrombopag.

* In general this refers to 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent exposure. 
Due to the application of a stopping criterion in most of the clinical studies, a lower proportion of subjects 
received 7 days of treatment in the lusutrombopag group than in the placebo group (73.1% versus 
91.2%).   
The number of patients with Child-Pugh class A liver disease was higher in the lusutrombopag group than 
in the placebo group (62.0% versus 55.3%, respectively). The cause for the difference in allocation was 
explained by the applicant and the type and incidence of AEs in Child Pugh-Class A patients were 
compared to Child Pugh Class B patients. The slight imbalance in Child Pugh Class A versus B between 
treatment and placebo group does not seem to have major influence on the safety outcome.  
A comparison of AEs in patients receiving lusutrombopag vs placebo was presented separately for 
subjects with Child-Pugh class B and Child-Pugh class A.   
Only one study (M0627) enrolled patients with Child-Pugh class C liver disorder at screening. Up to 15 
patients were planned. However, enrollment of eligible patients was difficult, with only 5 patients 
enrolled. 
Adverse events 
The applicant presented overall incidences of adverse events for the pooled safety analysis of the 
controlled studies that comprises data from three randomized double blind placebo-controlled trials (one 
Phase 2b and two Phase 3). In the pooled analysis, 112 (65.5%) of 171 patients treated with 
lusutrombopag 3 mg and 115 (67.5%) of 170 patients in the placebo group had one or more adverse 
events. 13 (7.6%) patients in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group and 14 (8.2%) patients in the placebo group 
were reported to have treatment-related AEs. 9 (5.3%) patients in the lusutrombopag group and 12 
(7.1%) patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events (fatal and nonfatal), including 2 subjects

(1.2%) in the lusutrombopag group and 1 (0.6%) in the placebo group who had serious adverse events 
that were considered treatment-related.  
Table 32: overview of adverse events (controlled studies Safety analysis population) 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in at least 5% of subjects in the 
pooled lusutrombopag or placebo treatment group were procedural pain (19.3% lusutrombopag versus 
17.1% placebo), postoperative fever (16.4% versus 20.0%), procedural hypertension (16.4% versus 
15.3%), increased AST (12.9% versus 11.8%), increased ALT (8.8% versus 5.9%), decreased oxygen 
saturation (5.3% versus 6.5%) and increased blood bilirubin (5.3% versus 2.4%). Except procedural pain 
(19.3% lusutrombopag versus 17.1% placebo), increased ALT (8.8% versus 5.9%) and increased blood 
bilirubin (5.3% versus 2.4%), no adverse event was reported at a ≥ 2% difference in the total 
lusutrombopag group than in the placebo group.  
Table 33: Adverse events with incidence ≥ 5% in either overall treatement group by preferred 
term (controlled studies) 
Most of the AEs were considered unrelated to the study drug. The most frequently reported 
treatment-related AEs in the lusutrombopag group were nausea (1.8% lusutrombopag versus 1.2% 
placebo) and headache (1.8% versus none). Higher incidence for placebo in treatment associated AEs 
were noted for diarrhoea (0.6% lusutrombopag versus 1.2% placebo), abdominal pain (none versus 
1.8%), fatigue (none versus 1.2%), vomiting (none versus 1.2%), increased AST (none versus 1.2%) 
and increased International normalised ratio (none versus 1.2%).

Table 34: Treatment related adverse events with incidence ≥ 1% in either overall treatment 
group by preferred term (controlled studies) (safety analysis population) 
The reported TEAEs are considered to be consistent with the nature of the invasive procedures and the 
underlying medical condition of the study population. It is of note, that fewer subjects in both treatment 
groups had adverse events before the invasive procedure (lusutrombopag, 26.1%; placebo, 35.0%) than 
after the procedure (lusutrombopag, 60.6%; placebo, 62.5%). Adverse events with onset before the 
invasive procedure reported for more than 1 subject in the lusutrombopag group were limited to 
procedural pain and procedural hypertension (each in 1.2% of subjects in the lusutrombopag group vs 0 
subjects in the placebo group).   
Common adverse events with onset after the invasive procedure in the lusutrombopag group were 
procedural pain (lusutrombopag, 20.0%; placebo, 18.1%), postoperative fever (lusutrombopag, 17.0%; 
placebo, 21.3%), procedural hypertension (lusutrombopag, 17.0%; placebo, 16.3%), increased AST 
(lusutrombopag, 13.3%; placebo, 11.3%), increased ALT (lusutrombopag, 9.1%; placebo, 6.3%), and 
decreased oxygen saturation (lusutrombopag, 5.5%; placebo, 6.9%). Apart from increased blood 
bilirubin (lusutrombopag, 4.8%; placebo, 1.0%), the incidence of adverse events occurring after the 
procedure was similar in the lusutrombopag and placebo groups or lower in the lusutrombopag group 
than in the placebo group. 
In the pooled analysis, the incidence of TEAEs is deemed comparable between the lusutrombopag and 
placebo group. However, in study M0626 a higher incidence of increased ALT (62.5% in the 
lusutrombopag 3 mg group versus 20% in placebo) and increased AST (37.5% versus none) was noted in 
subjects treated with lusutrombopag. The Applicant investigated age, Child Pugh score and number of 
liver cancers of all patients in study M0626 but no apparent correlation with the events of altered liver 
parameters could be determined. The Applicant provided additional data presenting the number and 
proportion of subjects who showed an increase in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) on day 8, day 14/17 and 
day 35. In study M0626, the proportion of subjects with increased AST >1.5x ULN was slightly higher at 
baseline, day 8, day 35 and at the time of the last observation in the lusutrompobag 3 mg group 
compared to placebo. A comparable tendency for increased AST in lusutrombopag-treated subjects was 
also observed in the pooled anaylsis of the controlled studies M0631 and M0634. However, a significantly 
higher incidence of increased ALT values >1.5x ULN was observed in lusutrombopag-treated subjects 
compared to placebo-treated subjects (50% lusutrombopag versus 26.7% placebo) at day 17.  
However, in the analysis showing increased liver parameters as change from baseline, the proportion of 
subjects with increased AST and ALT values >1.5x baseline was comparable between lusutrombopag and 
placebo group with the exception of one subject in the lusutrombopag group who showed an increased 
ALT value >1.5x baseline at day 8. In the combined analysis of the studies M0631 and M0634, the 
proportions of subjects with increased AST and ALT values >1.5x baseline at day 8 were higher for

lusutrombopag-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients (3.2% lusutrombopag versus 0.6% 
placebo). The proportion of subjects with increased AST and ALT values >3x baseline was low across all 
controlled studies and comparable between the lusutrombopag and placebo group. Thus, the results did 
not indicate a greater tendency for an increase of liver enzymes from baseline in patients treated with 
lusutrombopag than for patients treated with placebo in study M0626. The results obtained in study 
M0626 were comparable with the results obtained from the pooled analysis of the controlled studies 
M0631 and M0634. Although the provided analysis does not satisfactorily explain the reported higher 
incidence of adverse events of increased liver parameters in patients treated with lusutrombopag 
compared to placebo in study M0626, no safety concerns related to hepatotoxicity arise from these data. 
In addition, the imbalance of liver parameter changes in the phase II trial M026 could very well have 
arisen due to chance with regard to the low numbers enrolled into each treatment arm. 
A higher incidence of TEAEs has been observed in the studies conducted in Japan (M0626, M0631) in 
comparison to the multinational study (M0634). Different types of invasive procedures seem to affect the 
incidence of adverse events. A larger percentage of patients in the multinational study underwent less 
invasive procedures (e.g. gastrointestinal/endoscopy-related procedures: 57 % in the treatment group, 
liver related procedures: 18.7 %). Adverse events have been specified depending on the invasive 
procedure. The difference in the incidence of AEs in Asian and White subjects could not fully be explained 
by the differences of invasive procedures. However the incidence of AEs is comparable in the 
lusutrombopag and placebo group and does therefore seem to be unrelated to the treatment. Although 
weight is an influential covariate on PK and exposure may have been higher in Japanese subjects, no 
dose-related trends were noted across the Phase 2 studies in subjects with CLD. 
Bleeding Events 
In the pooled controlled studies (M0626, M0631, and M0634), 3.0% of lusutrombopag-treated subjects 
and 7.5% of placebo-treated subjects had bleeding events before the procedure, and 6.7% and 10.6%, 
respectively, had bleeding-related events after the procedure. The most frequent bleeding-related events 
were procedural haemorrhage (lusutrombopag, 3.0%; placebo, 1.3%), subcutaneous hemorrhage (1.8% 
and 0.6%, respectively), purpura (1.2% and none, respectively), and post-procedural hemorrhage (1.2% 
and 1.9%, respectively). 
The applicant presented overall incidences of adverse events for the pooled safety analysis of the 
uncontrolled studies which comprises four open-label studies. In the pooled analysis, 16 (100%) of 16 
patients in the lusutrombopag 0.25 – 1 mg group, 23 (95.8%) of 24 patients in the lusutrombopag 1.5 – 
2.5 mg, 98 (90.7%) of 108 patients in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group and 8 (100%) of 8 patients in the 
lusutrombopag 4 mg group had at least one adverse event. 3 (18.8%) patients in the lusutrombopag 
0.25- to 1-mg group, 2 (8.3%) patients in the 1.5- to 2.5-mg group, 6 (5.6%) patients in the 3 mg group 
and none in the 4 mg lusutrombopag group were reported to have treatment-related AEs.  No 
treatment-related adverse event was experienced by more than one subject (0.9%) for any preferred 
term. 1 (6.3%) subject in the lusutrombopag 0.25- to 1-mg group, 2 (8.3%) in the 1.5- to 2.5-mg group, 
5 (4.6%) in the 3 mg group, and 1 (12.5%) in the 4 mg group had serious adverse events (fatal and 
nonfatal), of which only 1 subject (0.9%) in the 3 mg group had a serious adverse event that was 
considered treatment-related.

Table 35: overview of treatment-emergent adverse events (uncontrolled studies) Safety 
analysis population 
The most common adverse events in the pooled lusutrombopag 3 mg group (>10%) were procedural 
hypertension (38.0%), postoperative fever (35.2%), procedural pain (28.7%), increased AST (24.1%), 
increased ALT (15.7%), constipation (11.1%), increased blood pressure and pyrexia (10.2% each). The 
AEs reported in the uncontrolled studies are considered to be consistent with the study population and the 
nature of the invasive procedures and reveal a similar pattern to that reported in the controlled studies. 
Table 36: adverse events with incidence ≥5% in the pooled lusutrombopag 3 mg group by 
preferred term (uncontrolled studies) Safety analysis population 
The most frequently adverse events reported in phase 1 studies excluding thrombocytopenic subjects 
with chronic liver disease were: feeling hot (7 subjects), increased platelet counts (13 subjects) and 
increased ALT (4 subjects in the lusutrombopag group and 2 subjects in the placebo group). The rate of 
treatment-related adverse events was low across the phase 1 studies and does not raise any safety 
concerns.  
Splenectomised patients were excluded from all studies. Since the spleen plays an important role in 
platelet storage, the safety profile of lusutrombopag might be different in patients who underwent a 
splenectomy.

The applicant evaluated adverse events of portal vein thrombosis and rash. Headache and nausea were 
also judged as being related to study treatment and occurred more frequently in the lusutrombopag arm 
compared to placebo (1.8% lusutrombopag versus 0% placebo for headache and 1.8% lusutrombopag 
versus 1.2% placebo for nausea).   
Adverse events of special interest 
Thrombotic adverse events 
In the controlled studies the incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events was almost equally 
distributed between the pooled placebo (4 subjects [2.4%]) and lusutrombopag 3 mg group (3 subjects 
[1.8%]). Thrombotic AEs were reported for 1 subject in the 2 mg group and 2 subjects in the 4 mg group. 
In the uncontrolled studies, thrombotic adverse events were reported for 1 subject (4.2%) in the 
lusutrombopag 1.5- to 2.5-mg group and 3 subjects (2.8%) in the 3-mg group. 2 thrombotic events were 
reported in study M0627. Except one event (cardiac ventricular thrombosis) which was found by a routine 
CT scan, all other thrombotic adverse events were found by imaging studies 3 to 10 days after the 
invasive procedure as specified in the protocol. No dose-related increase in the incidence of thrombotic 
events was noted in Study M0626. The majority of the subjects who experienced a thrombotic adverse 
event had platelet counts < 100 000/µl. One subject in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group and one subject in 
the lusutrombopag 4 mg group had platelet counts slightly above 100 000/µl. Only one subject in the 
placebo group showed a platelet count > 150 000/µl but still < 200 000/µl. Thus, no apparent relationship 
between thrombotic events and increased platelet counts was shown. Nevertheless, thrombotic events 
are a known risk among patients with liver cirrhosis and the prevalence increases with the severity of the 
underlying hepatic disease. The risk of thrombotic events may be increased in these patients when they 
undergo an invasive procedure. However, it might be possible that any elevation of platelet counts 
increases the risk in patients who have a predisposition to thromboembolic events. Several cases of portal 
vein thrombosis have been observed post-marketing in Japan.   
Worsening liver function 
Worsening liver function was defined retrospectively across the clinical development program as [(AST ≥ 
3 times the upper limit of normal [× ULN] or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN) + total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN] on the same 
date, including:  
-  Change in AST, ALT, and/or total bilirubin reported as an adverse event by the investigator  
-  Change in AST, ALT, and/or total bilirubin identified on retrospective analysis by the sponsor, but not 
reported as an adverse event by the investigator  
The incidence of the adverse event of worsening liver function was higher in the pooled placebo (8 
subjects [4.7%]) group than in the lusutrombopag group (4 subjects [2.3%]). No dose-related trends 
increase in the incidence of worsening liver function was noted in Phase 2b Study M0626. In the 
uncontrolled studies abnormal liver function was reported for 5 patients (31.3%) in the lusutrombopag 
0.25- to 1-mg group, 1 (4.2%) patient in the 1.5- to 2.5-mg group, 2 (1.9%) patients in the 3-mg group, 
and none in the 4-mg group.  In phase 1 studies 8 subjects were reported with altered liver function. The 
event of hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities was reversible and temporary. One subject (0.6%) in the 
lusutrombopag 3 mg group and 3 subjects (1.8%) in the placebo group had still altered laboratory values 
after the last observation on day 35.   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 125/142 
 
 
 
Five patients treated with once-daily doses of lusutrombopag ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg for up to 7 days 
died across the clinical development program of lusutrombopag. Four deaths were reported in controlled 
studies (Study M0626 and M0634) and one death in an uncontrolled study (M0623). Two of the five 
subjects died after procedural complications. The maximum platelet count in these 2 subjects was 
111,000/ěL. The non-procedural events with an outcome of death of the remaining three subjects were 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic cirrhosis, multi-organ failure and cardiac arrest. The 
maximum platelet count in these 3 subjects was 79,000/ěL.  
While none of the deaths were judged as being related to study drug by the investigators, the difference 
of five deaths in the lusutrombopag group and zero deaths in the placebo group is remarkable. It should 
be noted that three of five deaths occurred in the multinational phase 3 study (M0634) in the indicated 
dose of 3 mg lusutrombopag. It has been clearly shown that there is no obvious pattern in co-morbidities, 
co-medications or other risk factors that increased the likelihood of death with lusutrombopag treatment 
in this population. One patient with Child Pugh B liver disease died due to hepatic decompensation in the 
posttreatment period of study M0634. This patient experienced a rapid progression of the underlying 
disease. hTe medical history and the fatal outcome of this patient have been provided. The patient´s 
medical history included chronic viral hepatitis C and hepatic cirrhosis. In the medical death certificate 
completed by the treating physician it has been stated that the liver decompensation stage of this patient 
has been known since 2010 and thus the interval between the onset of pathological process and death 
was approximately 7 years. Additionally, the applicant provided a figure showing that liver function 
parameters (Alk phosphatase, ALT, AST and Bilirubin) were stable until day 15 (day of invasive 
procedure) and started to increase after day 15 whereas platelet counts started to decrease. Thus, no 
causal relationship of decompensated liver cirrhosis and lusutrombopag has been observed.  
Furthermore, one of 7 patients (14%) with Child-Pugh class C who were exposed to study drug has died 
(please refer to section safety in special populations).  
All deaths occurred in the posttreatment period (13-28 days after last drug administration) of the study 
and could be attributable to the underlying medical condition or the procedural complications. 
Nevertheless, three out of five deaths were associated with bleeding events including the non-procedural 
event of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and two procedural complications where the subjects died 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 126/142 
 
 
 
 
10 and 14 days after the complication. The posttreatment platelet counts of two subjects (treated with 2 
and 3 mg lusutrombopag, respectively) remained above the pre-treatment values and above the margin 
of 50x109/L suggesting no correlation between platelet counts and the haemorrhagic event leading to the 
outcome of death. One Subject received platelet transfusion on day 10 and day 11. However, since this 
patient has been treated with 0.5 mg lusutrombopag, lack of efficacy seems comprehensible. Thus, no 
safety concerns related to therapeutic failure or a rebound effect after treatment discontinuation arise 
from these data.  
The potential long-term toxicity of lusutrombopag was addressed by providing a summary of TEAE of two 
studies (M0621 and M0622) conducted in 20 patients with ITP who were treated with up to 2 mg 
lusutrombopag up to 387 days. The adverse event of bone marrow fibrosis has been reported in one 
subject on day 279. This is far from the intended 7-day treatment scheme and no safety concerns have 
been raised from the supportive studies.  
Serious adverse events 
In the pooled analysis of the controlled studies, 7 (4.1%) subjects treated with lusutrombopag 3 mg and 
12 (7.1%) subjects treated with placebo had one or more serious nonfatal adverse events. In the 
uncontrolled studies, 8 (5.1%) subjects treated with lusutrombopag had one or more serious nonfatal 
adverse event. No SAEs were reported in the phase 1 studies. 
The incidence of SAEs was low and similar between the lusutrombopag and placebo group. In the total 
pooled analysis, sinus node dysfunction (2 patients) and portal vein thrombosis (3 patients) were the only 
preferred terms reported for > 1 subject in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group. All other SAEs were reported 
in a single patient each. Except the thrombotic adverse events in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group and one 
event in the placebo group which were considered as related by the investigator all other serious adverse 
events were considered unrelated to the investigational product. The moderate treatment-related SAE of 
dehydration, hypokalemia, nausea and vomiting in the placebo group led to discontinuation of study drug 
administration. Treatment-related thrombotic SAEs were portal vein thrombosis in 3 subjects and cardiac 
ventricular thrombosis in 1 subject. All related SAEs resolved after drug discontinuation or corrective 
treatment. For a detailed evaluation of thrombotic events see section “adverse events of special interest”. 
In general, reported SAEs are considered to be consistent with the underlying medical condition of the 
study population and the nature of the invasive procedures. 
Additionally, in the Phase 1/Phase 2 study (Study M0627) in subjects with Child-Pugh class C liver disease 
treated with lusutrombopag 3 mg (Study M0627), there was 1 nonfatal serious adverse event (decreased 
neutrophil count). 
Laboratory findings 
Hematological and biochemical parameters, coagulation status, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse 
rate) and ECG were evaluated. There were some minor changes in haematology parameters in subjects 
treated with Lusutrombopag Shionogi. Only slight differences between the placebo and Lusutrombopag 
Shionogi treatment groups for WBC and RBC could be observed.  
There were minor changes in the biochemical laboratory parameters in subjects treated with 
Lusutrombopag Shionogi. AST, ALT and ALP values (mean change from baseline) showed an increase at 
day 14 in several patients. The increase of liver enzymes was higher in the Lusutrombopag Shionogi 
group than in the placebo group. This rise was reversible and has already decreased in most of the 
patients by the day of last observation (d35). The applicant provided additional tables presenting the 
number and proportion of subjects who showed an increase in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) on day 8, 
day 14/17 and day 35. The results of the submitted tables did not indicate a greater tendency for an 
increase of liver enzymes from baseline in patients treated with lusutrombopag than for patients treated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 127/142 
 
 
 
with placebo.For all other parameters and vital signs, no relevant changes have been observed after the 
treatment with Lusutrombopag Shionogi.  
Due to the fact that protein binding of S-888711 was higher than 99.9%, there might be an increased risk 
related to the possibility of achieving uncontrollably high drug concentration in patients with 
hypoalbuminemia. This especially applies to principal findings such as increase in the activity of AST, ALT 
and ALP and prolongation of PT and APTT, as the risk of liver toxicity seems to be underestimated. 
Additional data were provided showing that in patients with hypoalbuminemia treatment with 
lusutrombopag is not associated with any greater risk of hepatic abnormalities than placebo. However, 
data were available for the relatively low proportion of subjects with low albumin at baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of adverse events were performed on sex, age, race, liver function, invasive 
procedure and duration of treatment with regard to application of the stopping criterion. However, 
lusutrombopag effectiveness and safety was analysed in different rather small subgroups of age (<65, 
≥65 and <75, ≥ 75), races (White vs Asian) and Child-Pugh classes. During evaluation, the Applicant 
argued that the experience in the clinical efficacy and safety studies is, however, supplemented by the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies and analyses, including study M0627, a PK study in 
thrombocytopenic subjects with Child-Pugh class C liver disease and especially the population PK and 
population PK/PD analyses. In the light of the PK/PD analyses, the relatively low numbers of subjects in 
some categories is not considered clinically important.  
Intrinsic factors 
The incidence of adverse events was higher in females than in males in controlled studies. However the 
incidence of adverse events in females was also higher in the placebo group, therefore it does not give rise 
to concern. AEs in elderly ≥ 75 years of age increased in a higher proportion in the lusutrombopag group 
than in the placebo group. This finding was further elaborated by the applicant. The applicant argued that 
the low number of patients has to be considered and the small differences are often driven by one or two 
events. This finding could also be expected due to increased comorbidity and concomitant medication. 
Only procedural hypertension was reported at an incidence of >10% higher than in the placebo group.  
The applicant’s arguments are acknowledged.   
Lusutrombopag 3 mg administered orally once daily for up to 7 days appeared to be safe and well 
tolerated by thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD with Child-Pugh classes A and B who were undergoing 
an elective invasive procedure. However due to the limited number of patients suffering from Child-Pugh 
class C liver disease included in the studies no final conclusion on the safety of Lusutrombopag Shionogi 
in Child-Pugh class C patients can be drawn. During evaluation, the applicant provided additional 
post-marketing data and a thorough discussion regarding the safety profile of lusutrombopag in patients 
suffering from Child Pugh class C liver disease. The available safety database consists of the data from 8 
subjects who have been treated with the intended dose of 3 mg lusutrombopag in the clinical 
development program and additional postmarketing surveillance data of 10 subjects. One of these eight 
subjects with Child Pugh class C liver disease died due to multiorgan failure considered probably 
secondary to sepsis caused by C.difficile infection and cardiac arrest 21 days after the last administration 
of lusutrombopag. The death was considered not related to the study drug since bacterial infection is a 
common complication in the course of cirrhosis and worsening of clinical and biochemical parameters in 
bacterial infection generally correlate with the severity of the liver disease.  
The applicant provided additional literature showing that patients suffering from Child Pugh class C liver 
disease have a higher risk of bacterial infection and the mortality rate was approximately 5-fold higher in 
those patients compared to those without an infection. The provided post-marketing surveillance data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 128/142 
 
 
 
reported two additional deaths in patients with severe hepatic impairment. One subject died due to 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and one subject experienced serious hepatic cirrhosis and died due to 
intra-abdominal haemorrhage. The reported deaths seem to be consistent with the underlying medical 
condition of these patients and that there is no causal relationship between the reported outcomes of 
death and lusutrombopag treatment.  
Among the 8 subjects in the clinical development program, acute kidney injury and anaemia were the 
only adverse events that have been reported in two subjects. All other adverse events were reported in 
single subjects. Additionally, during the clinical development program it has been observed that the 
incidence of adverse events was higher in patients with Child Pugh class B liver disease compared to those 
patients with less hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class A). It might be expected that the incidence of AEs 
further increase in patients suffering from Child Pugh class C liver disease. However, since no difference 
has been observed between the lusutrombopag and placebo group for each subgroup (Child Pugh class A 
and B), the incidence of AEs is likely to be higher due to the increased comorbidity and the underlying 
medical condition of this population.  
Extrinsic factors: 
Invasive Procedure  
In the pooled controlled studies (M0626, M0631, and M0634), the incidence of adverse events was similar 
for lusutrombopag and for placebo in all invasive procedure subgroups. The incidence of adverse events 
was highest in subjects undergoing liver-related procedures in both the lusutrombopag and placebo 
groups. In the lusutrombopag group, ≥ 1 adverse event was reported for 83.6% of subjects undergoing 
liver-related procedures, 56.3% of subjects undergoing gastrointestinal/endoscopy-related procedures, 
and 42.9% undergoing other procedures. Corresponding percentages in the placebo group were 77.9%, 
66.2%, and 55.6%. Adverse events in the System Organ Class of “Investigations” and “Injury, poisoning, 
and procedural complications” occurred with higher incidences in the subgroup undergoing liver-related 
procedures, but the incidences in lusutrombopag and placebo groups were similar. 
Immunological events 
No information has been given on the immunogenicity of Lusutrombopag Shionogi. Due to the fact that 
Lusutrombopag Shionogi represents a small molecule, no immunological reaction is to be expected.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Coadministration of Lusutrombopag Shionogi with cyclosporine increased systemic exposure to 
lusutrombopag, and had an effect on the PK of lusutrombopag by P-gp and BCRP inhibition. Results of 
study M061E suggest that there was also a slight effect when coadministrated with cyclosporine on heart 
rate and QTc.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Across the clinical development program, two lusutrombopag-treated healthy male subjects (Phase 1 
study M0613) and one placebo-treated subject (Phase 3 study M0634) discontinued the study drug 
prematurely due to adverse events. One subject in the placebo group was withdrawn due to AEs of 
dehydration, hypokalemia, nausea and vomiting. The two healthy subjects in the lusutrombopag group 
were discontinued due to AEs of gastroenteritis and increased platelet count (>500,000/µl).  
All reported AEs leading to withdrawal resolved after discontinuation of the investigational product. No 
withdrawal of study drug administration due to AEs has been reported for the indicated dose of 3 mg 
lusutrombopag. Overall, the rate of study drug discontinuation due to adverse events was very low across 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018

the clinical development program and does not raise any safety concerns. In the pooled analysis of the 
controlled studies, four subjects discontinued study participation in the posttreatment period due to 
adverse events. Each of these reported adverse events had an outcome of death. More detailed 
justification and clarification of the backgrounds leading to the outcome of deaths has been provided by 
the Applicant (see section deaths). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
653 adult subjects were exposed to lusutrombopag in 20 clinical trials (317 subjects were healthy 
volunteers, dose: 0.1-50 mg). 285 were receiving a dose of 3 mg for up to 7 days (including 273 who 
underwent an invasive procedure). 343 subjects were included into controlled randomized studies 
receiving a dose of 3 mg of lusutrombopag or placebo (173/170). 108 subjects participating in 
uncontrolled studies received a treatment dose of 3 mg lusutrombopag. The number of subjects exposed 
to lusutrombopag seems adequate for the evaluation of the safety of Lusutrombopag Shionogi. 
The rate of study drug discontinuations and discontinuations in the post-treatment period of the study 
due to AEs was very low and did not raise any safety concerns.  
The most frequently reported related AEs were nausea (1.8% lusutrombopag, 1.2% placebo),  headache 
(1.8%, none), portal vein thrombosis and rash.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs were representative for the invasive procedures and the underlying 
medical condition of the study population. In the pooled analysis of the controlled studies, the most 
common TEAEs (>10%) were procedural pain (19.3% lusutrombopag, 17.1% placebo), postoperative 
fever (16.4%, 20.0%), procedural hypertension (16.4%, 15.3%) and increased AST (12.9%, 11.8%). 
Except for procedural pain (19.3% lusutrombopag, 17.1% placebo), increased ALT (8.8%, 5.9%) and 
increased blood bilirubin (5.3%, 2.4%), no adverse event was reported at a ≥ 2% difference in the total 
lusutrombopag group than in the placebo group. The majority of TEAEs occurred after the invasive 
procedure (60.6% lusutrombopag, 62.5% placebo). In the pooled analysis, no substantial differences 
were noted between the lusutrombopag and the placebo group.  
AST, ALT and ALP values (mean change from baseline) showed an increase at day 14 in several patients. 
The increase of liver enzymes was higher in the Lusutrombopag Shionogi group than in the placebo group. 
This rise was reversible and has already decreased in most of the patients by the day of last observation 
(d35). The applicant states that there is no difference between 3 mg lusutrombopag and placebo, on 
average, for ALT, AST, ALP and Bilirubin. However, in study M0626 increased AST and ALT were reported 
more frequently in the lusutrombopag group compared to placebo (62.5% lusutrombopag, 20% placebo). 
Age, Child Pugh score and number of liver cancers of all patients in study M0626 have been investigated 
but no apparent correlation with the events of altered liver parameters could be determined. The 
Applicant provided additional tables presenting the number and proportion of subjects who showed an 
increase in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) on day 8, day 14/17 and day 35.  The results did not indicate 
a greater tendency for an increase of liver enzymes from baseline in patients treated with lusutrombopag 
than for patients treated with placebo in study M0626. The results obtained in study M0626 were 
comparable with the results obtained from the pooled analysis of the controlled studies M0631 and 
M0634. Although the provided analysis does not satisfactorily explain the reported higher incidence of 
adverse events of increased liver parameters in patients treated with lusutrombopag compared to 
placebo in study M0626, no safety concerns related to hepatotoxicity arise from these data. In addition, 
the imbalance of liver parameter changes in the phase II trial M026 could very well have arisen due to 
chance with regard to the low numbers enrolled into each treatment arm.

A higher incidence of TEAEs has been observed in studies conducted in Japan (M0626 and M0631) 
compared to the multinational study (M0634). As a reason, the applicant mentions “more invasive 
procedures” in Asian subjects. Adverse events have been specified depending on the invasive procedure. 
The difference in the incidence of AEs in Asian and White subjects could not fully be explained by the 
differences of invasive procedures. However, the incidence of AEs is comparable in the lusutrombopag 
and placebo group and does therefore seem to be unrelated to the treatment. The reported TEAEs in the 
uncontrolled studies revealed a similar pattern to the controlled studies. No safety concerns arise from the 
submitted phase 1 studies. 
The applicant has adequately captured the adverse events of special interest including thromboembolic 
events and worsening of liver function. The incidence of thromboembolic events was low and almost 
equally distributed between the lusutrombopag (1.8%) and placebo (2.4%) group. Thrombotic events 
were not associated with increased platelet counts > 200.000/µl. However, it might be possible that any 
substantial elevation of platelet numbers increases the risk in patients with chronic liver disease who have 
a procoagulant predisposition. This risk is appropriately reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. The 
incidence of irreversible changes of liver function parameters was low in lusutrombopag-treated patients.  
The overall incidence of nonfatal SAEs was low across the clinical development program. The majority of 
SAEs were assessed as unrelated to the study medication. Three thromboembolic events in the 
lusutrombopag 3-mg group were judged as being related to the drug. This risk is adequately handled in 
section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. For a detailed evaluation of thromboembolic events see “adverse events 
of special interest”. The residual reported SAEs are considered to be consistent with the underlying 
disease of the study population and the nature of the invasive procedure and do not raise any particular 
concern.  
Five deaths occurred in patients treated with lusutrombopag doses ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg across the 
development programme. Two of the five subjects died after procedural complications. The remaining 
three subjects died due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic cirrhosis, multi-organ failure and 
cardiac arrest. Although three of five deaths occurred in the multinational phase 3 study (M0634), there 
was no obvious pattern in co-morbidities, co-medications or other risk factors that increased the 
likelihood of death with lusutrombopag treatment in this population. One patient with Child Pugh class B 
liver disease died due to hepatic decompensation in the posttreatment period of study M0634. Since this 
patient experienced a rapid progression of the underlying disease, the medical history and the fatal 
outcome of this patient has been discussed more thoroughly by the applicant. In the medical death 
certificate completed by the treating physician it has been stated that the liver decompensation stage of 
this patient has been known since 2010 and thus the interval between the onset of pathological process 
and death was approximately 7 years. There is no causal relationship between liver decompensation and 
lusutrombopag. Moreover, three deaths including the procedural complications and the upper 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage were associated with bleeding events. The list of platelet counts for each 
subject with an outcome of death associated with a bleeding event showed that the posttreatment 
platelet counts of two subjects (treated with 2 and 3 mg lusutrombopag, respectively) remained above 
the pretreatment values and above the margin of 50x109/L suggesting no correlation between platelet 
counts and the haemorrhagic event leading to the outcome of death. One Subject received platelet 
transfusion on day 10 and day 11. However, since this patient has been treated with 0.5 mg 
lusutrombopag, lack of efficacy seems comprehensible. Thus, no safety concerns related to therapeutic 
failure or a rebound effect after treatment discontinuation arise from these data.  
Co-medication with interferon preparations and splenectomy were defined as exclusion criteria across the 
entire clinical development program. Since this may have an impact on the safety profile of 
lusutrombopag, a warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 131/142 
 
 
 
Although lusutrombopag is intended to be administered for short-term use (7 days), a potential long term 
toxicity including potential increased risk of bone marrow fibrosis cannot be fully excluded for patients 
suffering from CLD and thrombocytopenia. However, data from supportive studies in ITP patients treated 
with up to 2 mg lusutrombopag for up to 387 days did not give raise to further safety concerns.  
Due to the application of a stopping criterion in most of the clinical studies, a lower proportion of subjects 
received 7 days of treatment in the lusutrombopag group than in the placebo group (73.1% versus 
91.2%). In the SmPC, a fixed 7 day administration is proposed and no stopping criterion has been 
foreseen for the treatment with lusutrombopag.  
The presented data indicate a slightly improved efficacy of lusutrombopag at a fixed 7-day treatment 
regimen. Conversely, comparative assessment of safety data is uncertain due to the sparsity of data. 
However, it is considered that data presented do not implicate a substantial safety issue with regard to a 
7-day treatment with lusutrombopag without the application of a stopping criterion. For patients at risk 
(i.e. low bodyweight, PK interactions, Child Pugh class C) further monitoring is advised in the SmPC.  
Some subjects were included in more than one clinical study or received lusutrombopag in 2 treatment 
groups within the same study. Data observed at retreatment have been excluded from the pooled 
analysis. Due to the very sparse set of data available, the fact, that there is limited data in retreatment 
with lusutrombopag has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There is a limited number of patients suffering from Child-Pugh class C liver disease included in the 
studies. The Applicant provided additional post-marketing data and a thorough discussion regarding the 
safety profile of lusutrombopag in patients suffering from Child Pugh class C liver disease. It might be 
expected that the incidence of AEs and the rates of deaths are likely to be higher due to the increased 
comorbidity and the underlying medical condition of this population. In addition to the death reported 
during the clinical development program, two deaths have been reported in the provided post-marketing 
surveillance data in patients suffering from Child Pugh class C liver disease. The applicant thoroughly 
justified and clarified the backgrounds leading to the outcome of death. Two of three subjects died due to 
bacterial infection. Since bacterial infection is a common and life-threating complication of cirrhosis, the 
reported deaths seem to be consistent with the underlying medical condition of these patients. Although 
the provided safety database is limited in patients with Child Pugh class C liver disease, there is an unmet 
medical need in this subgroup of patients. The warning statement is considered adequate to further 
improve the safety in Child Pugh C patients by additional monitoring. Additionally, a PASS will be 
conducted by the applicant which will collect safety data for lusutrombopag in patients with Child Pugh C 
liver disease in a systematic manner.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Lusutrombopag 3 mg administered orally once daily for up to 7 days was shown to be safe and well 
tolerated by thrombocytopenic subjects with CLD with Child-Pugh classes A and B who were undergoing 
an elective invasive procedure.  
However, only 8 patients with Child-Pugh class C received lusutrombopag and one of these patients has 
died during the clinical development program. It might be expected that the incidence of AEs and the 
rates of deaths are likely to be higher due to the increased comorbidity and the underlying medical 
condition of this population. In addition to the death reported during the clinical development program, 
two deaths have been reported in the provided post-marketing surveillance data in patients suffering 
from Child Pugh class C liver disease. Although the provided safety database is limited in patients with 
Child Pugh class C liver disease, there is an unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients. The warning 
statement in the SmPC is considered adequate to further improve the safety in Child Pugh C patients by

additional monitoring. Additionally, a PASS will be conducted by the applicant which will collect safety 
data for lusutrombopag in patients with Child Pugh C liver disease in a systematic manner.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
PhV development plan could be sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product, provided a 
study protocol is submitted for review within 3 months after EC decision.  
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The active substance is not included in the EURD list and a new entry will be required. The new EURD list 
entry uses the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The requirements for submission of 
periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP 
Opinion. The applicant did request an alignment of the PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). 
The IBD is 28.09.2015. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers lusutrombopag to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lusutrombopag Shionogi (lusutrombopag) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it is a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lusutrombopag is proposed for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic 
liver disease undergoing invasive procedures. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At present, the only treatment option for patients with chronic liver disease and with a bleeding risk due 
to severe thrombocytopenia prior to invasive procedures is the administration of platelet transfusions. 
There are no licensed pharmaceutical alternatives available in the EU. Although two different TPO 
receptor agonists are on the market, Revolade (eltrombopag) and Nplate (romiplostim), these are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 135/142 
 
 
 
licensed for treatment of ITP, thrombocytopenia associated with hepatitis C infection preventing antiviral 
therapy and acquired severe aplastic anaemia (Revolade) and ITP (Nplate). 
It is possible for patients who receive repeated transfusions to become refractory and not achieve a 
sufficiently increased platelet count post transfusion. The indication for platelet transfusions is depending 
on the invasiveness of the procedure as well as the severity of the thrombocytopenia.  
The prevalence of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis has been reported to be only 6%, 
but occurs in up to 78% of patients with cirrhosis. Moderate thrombocytopenia and severe 
thrombocytopenia are observed in approximately 13% and 1%, respectively, of cirrhotic patients 
(Thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease, Markus Peck-Radosavljevic, Liver International. 
2017;37:778–793). Literature on the prevalence and incidence of cirrhosis is scarce. However, available 
data suggest that about 0.1% of the European population is affected by cirrhosis, corresponding to 14-26 
new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year or an estimated 170,000 deaths per year (The Burden of 
Liver Disease in Europe; M. Blachier; EASL 2013). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The dossier of lusutrombopag contains two pivotal clinical trials (M0631, M0634) and an additional phase 
IIIb clinical trial (M0633). 
Both pivotal trials were randomized, double-blind, multi-centre studies that enrolled patients suffering 
from chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh class A or B severity and thrombocytopenia below 50.000/µL 
planned to undergo elective invasive procedures, e.g. liver ablation, endoscopic variceal ligation etc. Trial 
M0631 enrolled 96 Japanese subjects, while trial M0634 enrolled 215 mainly Caucasian subjects and 
randomized them 1:1 to lusutrombopag 3mg per day or placebo up to 7 days. Both trials applied a 
stopping criterion on day 5, 6 and 7 before administration of the study medication. If the platelet count 
was ≥50.000 and showed an increase of ≥20.000 over baseline on any of these days, the treatment was 
terminated. This stopping criterion was introduced to prevent an excessive increase in platelet counts, 
which is associated with a heightened risk for thromboembolic events. Thus, a proportion of subjects in 
each trial received less than a 7 day regimen with lusutrombopag (or placebo). 
The phase IIIb trial M0633 was an open-label, parallel-group trial in Japanese subjects with CLD and 
severe thrombocytopenia planned to undergo an elective procedure. This study endeavoured to 
investigate the impact of a less strict or no stopping criterion in two arms, respectively (A/B-1, n=47; 
A/B-2, n=47) and repeated treatment with lusutrombopag in a third arm (n=8). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint in phase III trial M0631 (i.e. no transfusion before primary invasive 
procedure) could be reached by 79.2% (CI 65.0, 89.5%) of patients receiving lusutrombopag and 12.5% 
(CI 4.7, 25.2%) of placebo recipients in the FAS. In the multinational trial M0634, 64.8% (CI 53.1, 
72.1%) of patients in the lusutrombopag group and 29.9% (CI 20.6, 38.5%) in the placebo group in the 
FAS met this endpoint, which was defined as a secondary efficacy outcome. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in phase III trial M0634 (i.e. no transfusion before primary invasive 
procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding through 7 days after the invasive procedure) could be 
reached by 64.8% (CI 55.0, 73.8%) of subjects in the lusutrombopag group compared to 29.0% (CI 20.6, 
38.5%) in the placebo group in the FAS.  
In trial M0631, 75.5% (CI 61.1, 86.7%) of the lusutrombopag subjects and 12.5% (CI 4.7, 25.2%) of 
placebo subjects met the post hoc calculated endpoint (i.e. the avoidance of platelets pre-procedurally as 
well as no need for rescue therapy for bleeding during 7 days after the procedure). This outcome measure 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 136/142 
 
 
 
is considered to be even more clinically relevant than the primary endpoint used in M0631 (proportion of 
patients who did not need a transfusion before the primary invasive procedure), because this endpoint 
demonstrates the continued protection against bleeding events during the healing period. 
The efficacy outcomes from trial M0633 are comparable to those of trial M0631, with 80.9% (CI 66.7, 
90.9%) of subjects in arm A/B-1, 83.0% (CI 69.2, 92.4%) in A/B-2 and 75% (CI 34.9, 96.8%) in 
non-naïve A/B requiring no platelet transfusions prior to the invasive procedure.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Considering that lusutrombopag is excreted mainly via the feces; the impact on the PK of lusutrombopag 
is likely therefore there is an uncertainty with regards to the use of Lusutrombopag Shionogi in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). For Child-Pugh class A and B only modest 
differences in PK were observed. Unfortunately only very few subjects with Child-Pugh class C were 
available for evaluation. The PK/PD modelling seems to indicate that no clinically significant differences 
are to be expected on platelet increase of lusutrombopag in patients with different severity of hepatic 
impairment. Nonetheless, a warning statement has been added in section 4.4. of the SmPC concerning 
close monitoring for early signs of worsening and platelet counts monitoring in Child Pugh Class C 
subjects in order to ensure safety in this subgroup of patients with an unmet medical need. This has also 
been added as missing information in the RMP.  
Patients with past or present thrombosis (e.g., cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, 
pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome) 
were not enrolled into the clinical trials. However, it is not warranted to exclude all patients with any 
thromboembolic event from the indication. An appropriate statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC covers all 
at risk groups and is deemed sufficient to alert the treating physician to a potentially increased risk of 
thrombotic or thromboembolic events. This has also been added as an important identified risk in the 
RMP. 
Concerning the severity of the planned invasive procedure, only interventions with a mild to moderate 
bleeding risk were allowed during the clinical investigation programme. Major surgery like laparotomy, 
thoracotomy, craniotomy, open-heart surgery or organ resection was excluded in all clinical trial 
protocols. This is reflected accordingly in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
In all clinical trials pertaining to dose-finding and efficacy, subjects with splenectomy or concomitant 
interferon therapy were consistently excluded and not all observed outcomes can be readily extrapolated 
to those patients. Appropriate statements to this effect have been included in scetion 4.4. of the SmPC. 
A trend to higher peak platelet counts in patients with very low body weight <45 kg was observed. 
Therefore, additional platelet monitoring is considered warranted for this subpopulation and a warning 
has been added accordingly in the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
653 adult subjects were exposed to lusutrombopag in the course of 20 clinical trials (317 subjects were 
healthy volunteers, dose: 0.1-50 mg). The most frequently reported TEAEs were representative of the 
invasive procedures and the underlying medical condition of the study population.  
In the pooled analysis of the controlled studies, the most common TEAEs (>10%) were procedural pain 
(19.3% lusutrombopag, 17.1% placebo), postoperative fever (16.4%, 20.0%), procedural hypertension 
(16.4%, 15.3%) and increased AST (12.9%, 11.8%). Except procedural pain (19.3% lusutrombopag, 
17.1% placebo), increased ALT (8.8%, 5.9%) and increased blood bilirubin (5.3%, 2.4%), no adverse 
event was reported at a ≥ 2% difference in the total lusutrombopag group than in the placebo group. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/817852/2018  
Page 137/142 
 
 
 
majority of TEAEs occurred after the invasive procedure (60.6% lusutrombopag, 62.5% placebo). No 
substantial differences were noted between the lusutrombopag and the placebo group. The reported 
TEAEs in the uncontrolled studies revealed a similar pattern to the controlled studies.  
Thromboembolic events and worsening of liver function are adverse events of special interest. Three 
thromboembolic events in the lusutrombopag 3-mg group were judged as being related to the drug. The 
incidence of thromboembolic events was low and almost equally distributed between the lusutrombopag 
(1.8%) and placebo (2.4%) group. Thrombotic events were not associated with increased platelet counts. 
The incidence of persistent worsening of liver function was low. One subject in the lusutrombopag 3 mg 
group and 3 subjects in the placebo group had still altered laboratory values after the last observation on 
day 35. A warning is reflected in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Five patients treated with lusutrombopag ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg and none treated with placebo died 
across the development programme of lusutrombopag. Two of the five subjects died after procedural 
complications. The remaining three subjects died due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic 
cirrhosis, multi-organ failure and cardiac arrest. All reported deaths were judged as being unrelated to the 
drug.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although the provided safety database is limited with regard to patients with Child Pugh class C liver 
disease, there is an unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients. The warning statement in the SmPC 
is considered adequate to manage the potential risks in patients with Child Pugh class C liver disease by 
additional monitoring for early signs of worsening or new onset hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and 
thrombotic or bleeding tendency through monitoring of liver function tests, tests used for assessing 
clotting status and through imaging of portal vasculature. Additionally, a PASS will be conducted by the 
Applicant, which will collect safety data for lusutrombopag in patients with Child Pugh C liver disease in a 
systematic manner. 
In Study M0626 increased AST and ALT were reported more frequently in the lusutrombopag group 
compared to placebo (62.5% lusutrombopag, 20% placebo). The applicant provided additional tables 
presenting the number and proportion of subjects who showed an increase in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, 
ALP) on day 8, day 14/17 and day 35. The results did not indicate a greater tendency for an increase of 
liver enzymes from baseline in patients treated with lusutrombopag than for patients treated with placebo 
in study M0626. The results obtained in study M0626 were comparable with the results obtained from the 
pooled analysis of the controlled studies M0631 and M0634. Although the provided analysis does not 
satisfactorily explain the reported higher incidence of adverse events of increased liver parameters in 
patients treated with lusutrombopag compared to placebo in study M0626, no safety concerns related to 
hepatotoxicity arise from these data. In addition, the imbalance of liver parameter changes in the phase 
II trial M026 could very well have arisen due to chance with regard to the low numbers enrolled into each 
treatment arm. 
With regards to duration of treatment, the presented data indicate a slightly improved efficacy of 
lusutrombopag at a fixed 7-day treatment regimen. Conversely, comparative assessment of safety data 
is uncertain due to the sparsity of data. However, it is considered that data presented do not implicate a 
substantial safety issue with regard to a 7-day treatment with lusutrombopag without the application of 
a stopping criterion. For patients at risk further monitoring is advised in section 4.4. of the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of lusutrombopag in raising platelet levels sufficiently to avoid platelet transfusions was 
clearly demonstrated across the six phase II and phase III trials. Up to 80% of patients with CLD and 
severe thrombocytopenia were able to forego pre-procedural transfusions, and nearly the same 
proportion could avoid platelets during the whole study period of 35 days. A clinically even more relevant 
outcome, the avoidance of platelets pre-procedurally as well as no need for rescue therapy for bleeding 
during 7 days after the procedure, could be met by 64.8% and 75.5% of patients on lusutrombopag in the 
pivotal trials M0634 (primary endpoint) and M0631 (calculated post hoc), respectively. This is in contrast 
to only 29% and 12.5% of patients who require no platelets during the study period in the placebo groups 
of trial M0634 and M0631. Because no major issues with regard to methodology were noticed for either 
study, estimates of a positive treatment effect difference (following the ITT principle) can be considered 
reliable and statistically significant. The notion that lusutrombopag is an effective treatment modality is 
further supported by compatible results on secondary endpoints, as well as sensitivity analyses based on 
the per-protocol population.

An increase in platelet counts was apparent after 5-6 days of treatment, with a peak of about 12-14 days 
after initiation of lusutrombopag. Platelet levels returned to baseline after approximately 28 days, thus 
affording patients’ protection against bleeding events during and after the planned invasive procedure, 
i.e. during the healing process. In contrast, transfused platelets have a short lifespan and their effect 
usually disappears after 3 to 4 days at the latest. This kinetic could be readily observed in the placebo 
patients receiving transfusions.  
The ability to avoid platelet transfusions, which have to be administered under medical supervision and 
which are associated with other transfusion reactions is considered an important benefit for this gravely 
ill population. Platelet concentrates account for near 10% of all labile blood components but are 
responsible for more than 25% of the reported adverse events (Garraud et al. Blood Transfus 2016; 14: 
109-22). 
The observed unfavourable effects were generally consistent with the multi-morbidity of the investigated 
population and the nature of the invasive procedure and no substantial imbalance with regards to the 
nature and severity of adverse events observed in the placebo group was apparent. The vast majority of 
TEAEs were reversible, and in the clinical phase II and III trials with the 3mg dose, there were no 
treatment withdrawals due to unwanted effects.  
Uncertainties in subpopulations that have not been well characterised (e.g. body weight below 45kg) or 
were excluded from the study population (e.g. patients with splenectomy) can be addressed with 
additional safety precautions in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Lusutrombopag was administered orally once daily for up to 7 days in 6 phase II and phase III trials. Its 
ability to elevate platelet counts and thus lower the bleeding risk during and after invasive procedures, as 
substantiated by the avoidance of platelet transfusions preprocedurally as well as rescue medication for 
bleeding until 7 days after the intervention, could be able to outweigh the observed unfavourable effects. 
These effects consist mostly of events related to the morbidity of the patient population and the 
invasiveness of the procedure, e.g. pain, fever, hypertension and elevation of liver enzymes.  
The proposed fixed 7-day dosing regimen is supported by limited data only. Additional platelet monitoring 
at least once approximately 5 days after the first lusutrombopag dose is advised and reflected in the 
SmPC for the different subsets of patients at higher risk, i.e, patients with Child Pugh C liver disease and 
patients with body weight ≤45 kg. Appropriate measures such as discontinuation of lusutrombopag should 
be taken, if the platelet count reaches ≥50,000/µL as a result of a 20,000/µL increase from baseline..  
The available data pertaining to patients with the most severe liver disease (Child-Pugh Class C) are 
limited. However, efficacy of lusutrombopag in patients with Child Pugh class C disease is likely to be 
comparable to patients with a lesser grade of liver disease. This notion is supported by the evaluation of 
efficacy in those patients who were included into the clinical development programme or identified in post 
marketing surveillance data from Japan. There is an unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients. The 
warning statement is considered adequate to manage the potential risks in Child Pugh C patients by 
additional monitoring for early signs of worsening or new onset hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and 
thrombotic or bleeding tendency, through monitoring of liver function tests, tests used for assessing 
clotting status and through imaging of portal vasculature. Additionally, a PASS will be conducted by the 
Applicant which will collect safety data for lusutrombopag in patients with Child Pugh C liver disease in a 
systematic manner. 
3.8.  Conclusions

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Lusutrombopag Shionogi is favourable in the following indication: 
Lusutrombopag Shionogi is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with 
chronic liver disease undergoing invasive procedures (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lusutrombopag is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

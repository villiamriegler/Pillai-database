1. 
Introduction 
Mabthera (rituximab) is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody which 
binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20. This antigen is located on pre-B- and mature 
B-lymphocytes, but not on hemopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal 
cells.  The  CD20  antigen  is  also  expressed  on  >95%  of  all  B  cell  NHL.  After  binding  to  the  CD20 
antigen  on  the  cell  surface,  rituximab  is  believed  to  exert  its  therapeutic  effect  by  promoting  B  cell 
lysis.  Possible  mechanisms  of  cell  lysis  include  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity,  antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis.   
Mabthera is available in single-use vials containing 100 mg/10 ml and 500 mg/50 ml concentrate for 
solution  for  infusion.  Mabthera  (rituximab)  was  approved  in  the  EU  in  June  1998  and  is  currently 
approved for a number of indications: 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
• 
treatment  of  previously  untreated  patients  with  stage  III-IV  follicular  lymphoma  in 
combination with chemotherapy.  
•  maintenance  therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma responding to 
induction therapy with chemotherapy with or without MabThera. 
•  monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who 
• 
are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy 
treatment  of  patients  with  CD20  positive  diffuse  large  B cell  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  in 
combination  with  CHOP  (cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  prednisolone) 
chemotherapy. 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
MabThera in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe 
active  rheumatoid  arthritis  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  or  intolerance  to  other  disease-
modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARD)  including  one  or  more  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF) 
inhibitor therapies. 
This  is  a  new  indication  concerning  ‘first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL) in combination with chemotherapy’ and is based on one pivotal phase III study 
(ML 17102) and published data from phase II studies and retrospective studies.   
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia comprising 30% 
of all adult leukaemias. The incidence of CLL is around 3/100,000 inhabitants per year in the Western 
hemisphere and increases with age. The rate is almost 50/100,000 cases per year above the age of 70 
years. The median age at first diagnosis is in the range of 65-70 years and men are affected more often 
than women. Over the years, the incidence has increased in younger patients and now about one-third 
of CLL patients are younger than 55 years at diagnosis.  
CLL patients have an extremely variable clinical course and prognosis depending on disease stage and 
presence.  The two clinical staging systems developed by Rai and Binet are widely used and are an 
accepted prognostic tool.  
According to recently issued update of the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute Working Group 
(NCI-WG)  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  asymptomatic  early-stage  disease  (Binet  A)  should  be 
monitored without therapy unless they have evidence of disease progression. However, therapy should 
be  given  to  all  patients  with  Binet  stage  C  disease  and  to  patients  with  symptomatic  or  progressive 
Binet stage B disease.  
There is no universally accepted standard treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL. Single 
alkylating  agents  (chlorambucil,  cyclophosphamide)  are  widely  established;  single  purine-analogues 
such  as  fludarabine  or  cladribine  may  also  be  used.  Despite  initial  response  with  single  agent 
therapies,  most  patients  progress  and  require  further  therapy  within  1-2  years  after  single  agent 
therapy.    
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combination  chemotherapy  is  widely  used  in  order  to  induce  longer  progression-free/treatment  free 
periods.  Treatment  with  fludarabine  and  cyclophosphamide  (FC)  is  considered  by  many  CLL  study 
groups worldwide as a standard treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL who can tolerate 
this regimen.  
Based on synergistic activity between purine analogues, alkylating agents and monoclonal antibodies, 
new active combination therapies for CLL were introduced over the last years.    
2. 
Clinical aspects 
Study ML17102 was initiated in July 2003 as a national collaborative group study led by the German 
CLL Study Group (GCLLSG). The study was opened for international participation in 2004 and legal 
sponsorship was transferred to the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH), Roche.  
Scientific advice was sought by the MAH at the level of the national agencies of the Rapporteurs (DK 
and NL) and two protocol amendments were implemented.  
The pre-planned interim analysis of study ML17102 was performed with a clinical cut-off of July 4, 
2007 and presented to the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in January 2008. 
The DSMB concluded that on the basis of these data, the primary objective of the study had been met 
and that the results demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for rituximab when added to FC (R-
FC) versus FC alone as induction treatment for patients with previously untreated CLL. The DSMB 
considered  the  results  to  be  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  and  recommended 
stopping the study and fully analyzing the study data. 
Data from a series of published phase II studies were also provided and on the basis of these studies, in 
addition to the ML17102 study results. 
Study  ML17102  was  conducted  according  to  the  guidelines  of  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP).  Nine 
study  centres  were  audited,  and  the  Collaborative  Group  had  2  system  audits.  All  audits  were 
conducted by the Roche Clinical Quality Assurance Group or designees. Significant non-compliance 
with GCP was observed which, in the opinion of the auditors, did not affect the validity of the data or 
patients’ safety and/or rights. Appropriate corrective and preventive actions were undertaken. 
2. 1.   Clinical Efficacy 
The  proposed  indication  for  rituximab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  previously  untreated 
patients  with  CLL  is  based  on  data  from  one  randomized  phase  III  pivotal  study  (ML17102  also 
known  as  study  CLL-8).  This  study  is  supported  by  published  data  from  phase  II  studies.  Between 
them, these studies include a total of more than 900 patients with previously untreated CLL and more 
than  400  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  disease,  all  treated  with  rituximab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy. Table 1 below is summarising the content of the application.

Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Rituximab at the normal lymphoma dose and schedule (375 mg/m2 iv. weekly) is not very effective for 
the treatment of small  lymphocytic lymphoma  (the  non-leukaemic equivalent of CLL).  Some 
investigators  have  found  a  convincing  dose–response  effect  in  patients  with  CLL  using  a  dose-
escalation  strategy.  A  75%  response  rate  was  observed  in  patients  with  CLL  who  received  the 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
maximum  rituximab  monotherapy  dose  of  2250 mg/m2  (six  times  the  standard  lymphoma  dose)  as 
compared to a response rate ranging from 10% to 45% with the standard regime. Others have tested a 
dose-intense  schedule  of  three  weekly  rituximab  infusions  at  standard  dose  levels  and  reported  an 
improved response rate (45%) in previously treated patients with CLL/SLL. 
Two phase II studies of rituximab at 500 mg/m2 (375mg/m2 for the first cycle) in combination with 
fludarabine  (25 mg/m2/day)  and  cyclophosphamide  (250 mg/m2/day)  for  3  days  were  initiated  in 
patients with untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). 
These  studies  demonstrated  very  high  response  rates  and  long  PFS  with  this  regimen.  This  regimen 
was subsequently chosen for testing in phase III clinical trials including study ML17102. 
Pivotal study ML1702 
Study  ML17102  was  a  prospective,  randomized,  open-label  multicenter  phase  III  study.  Study 
ML17102 included mainly previously untreated CD-20 positive CLL patients with symptomatic Binet 
stage B disease in need of therapy and Binet stage C disease (95% of the population).   
Patients were planned to receive 6 treatment cycles of FC chemotherapy (fludarabine [25 mg/m2] and 
cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m2] i.v. on days 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle) at intervals of 28 days. Patients 
randomized to the R-FC arm received FC in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2 i.v. on day 0 of 
cycle 1, 500 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 of cycles 2-6).  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  progression-free  survival.  Secondary  endpoints  included  Event-
free  survival,  Overall  survival,  Disease-free  survival,  Duration  of  response,  Time  to  new  CLL 
treatment  or  death,  Rates  of  molecular,  complete  and  partial  response,  Response  rates  and  survival 
times in biological subgroups. 
The  evaluation  of  the  treatment  outcome  and  disease  progression  was  performed  according  to  the 
updated  criteria  of  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Sponsored  Working  Group  on  CLL.  These 
outcomes  were  assessed  by  the  investigators.  An  independent  assessment  of  the  data  was  not 
performed. However, the absence of an independent review is not considered a major problem. CLL is 
a systemic disease with neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow that can be assessed 
objectively  and  the  assessment  of  peripheral  lymph  nodes  and  hepatosplenomegaly  is  clinical.  CT 
scans/ultra  sound  scans  to  document  disease  status  are  not  considered  necessary  in  the  response 
evaluation  of  patients  with  CLL  as  their  additional  value  has  not  been  demonstrated  in  past  clinical 
studies.  Interim  staging  was  performed  after  3  cycles  of  therapy  before  starting  the  4th  cycle.  All 
patients who showed at least a partial response (PR/CR) after the first 3 cycles, continued treatment 
according to the protocol for a total of 6 cycles of therapy. Patients who showed insufficient response 
(SD/PD) after the first 3 cycles of treatment were withdrawn from study treatment and were eligible to 
receive alternative treatment. However, all patients prematurely withdrawn from trial treatment were 
followed  for  disease  progression  (irrespective  of  new  treatment),  new  treatment  and  survival  as 
scheduled by the CLL-8 protocol. 
The primary endpoint PFS was used to determine the sample size of the study. Based on data from the 
German CLL-4 trial , the median PFS was assumed to be 40 months in the FC arm (corresponding to a 
66% PFS rate at 2 years) and 54 months in the R-FC arm. A median benefit of 35% corresponding to a 
hazard ratio of 0.741, was judged as both realistic and clinically relevant. Thus, the main analysis was 
triggered once 357 events (disease progression or death) were reached. With this number of events, it 
could also be possible to detect a median PFS benefit of 45% with a power of 80% at the overall alpha 
level of 1%. 
Assuming  a  linear  recruitment  over  38  months  resulting  in  760  patients,  a  study  duration  of 
approximately  62  months  was  expected  to  reach  the  required  357  events  which  triggered  the  main 
analysis. An interim analysis was planned to be performed after 238 events have occurred (66.7% of 
357).  If  the  median  in  the  FC  arm  was  in  truth  45  months  (the  benefit  was  still  at  35%  and  the 
exponential assumption held), the study lasted approximately 5 months longer.

The  efficacy  analyses  on  PFS,  OS,  EFS,  DFS,  DR  and  TTNT  were  based  on  a  non-stratified, 
two-sided Log-rank test. Response rates were compared applying a two-sided Chi-square test. For the 
primary endpoint PFS, the significance level’s alpha was 0.012 at the interim analysis (after 2/3 of the 
events)  to  maintain  an  overall  two-sided  type I  error  of  5%.  All  tests  on  secondary  endpoints  were 
performed  at  a  nominal  significance  level  α = 0.05  (2-sided).  No  adjustment  for  the  multiplicity  of 
testing  was  performed  for  the  secondary  parameters.  No  formal  testing  of  safety  endpoints  was 
performed. 
The first patient was randomized in the study on July 21, 2003 and the last patient was randomized on 
April 4, 2006. The cut-off date for the primary analysis presented in this report was July 4, 2007. A 
total  of  817  patients  were  randomized  in  the  study  at  190  centres  in  11  countries  with  each  centre 
recruiting between 1 and 21 patients. 
A  pre-planned  interim  analysis  of  study  ML17102  was  performed  with  a  clinical  cut-off  of  July  4, 
2007 and presented to the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in January 2008. 
At the time of interim analysis (clinical cut-off July 4th, 2007) there were 254 PFS events available. 
The DSMB concluded that on the basis of these data, the primary objective of the study had been met 
and that the results demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for rituximab when added to FC (R-
FC) versus FC alone as induction treatment for patients with previously untreated CLL. The DSMB 
considered  the  results  to  be  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  and  recommended 
stopping the study and fully analyzing the study data. 
Demographics  and  disease  characteristics  assessed  at  baseline  (BL)  were  well  balanced  between  the 
two  treatment  arms.  The  median  age  was  61 years  with  a  predominance  of  males  (74%).  Sixty-four 
percent of patients had Binet stage B disease at BL, 31% had Binet stage C and 5% had Binet stage A 
disease. A total of 58% of patients had lymphocyte counts >50 Giga/L at study entry, splenomegaly 
was present in 70%lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated in 41%, and the proportion of patients 
with B symptoms was around 45%. Prognostic biomarkers were balanced between the arms: del 11q 
was present in 25% of patients, del 17p in 8%, a complex karyotype ( ≥ 2 cytogenetic abnormalities) 
was found in 22% of patients with available data. Sixty-five percent of patients had un-mutated Give, 
41% were ZAP-70+, and 46% were CD38+ at BL. Overall, the distribution of prognostic biomarkers 
was representative of a population of previously untreated CLL patients in need of therapy. 
A total of 817 patients were randomized in the study (409 patients in the FC arm and 408 patients in 
the R-FC arm) at 190 centres in 11 countries. Although not specified in the protocol, but following the 
request of the Danish Medicines Agency (Rapporteur) at the pre-submission meeting of May 9, 2008, 
the main analysis of study ML17102 as presented in this dossier, was based on the ITT population and 
included all randomized patients (apart from those with missing informed consent), in order to comply 
with  regulatory  requirements.  A  total  of  7 patients  (2 patients  on  FC,  5 patients  on  R-FC)  had  a 
missing  informed  consent  at  the  time  of  the  main  analysis  and  were  excluded  from  all  analyses. 
Therefore, the ITT population included a total of 810 patients (407 FC, 403 R-FC). 
Results 
At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis  (clinical  cut-off  July 4,  2007),  a  total  of  254 patients  (31%)  had 
progressed or died. In the FC arm, 37% (152/407) of the patients had experienced an event compared 
to 25% (102/403 pts) in the R-FC arm.  
As none of the study subjects were on active treatments at the time of clinical cut off, an additional 
follow up of 4.8 months was included, resulting in a total study duration of approximately 25 months. 
This is rather short for a disease with a mean course of several years and also the results are derived 
from an interim analysis. However, the MAH has satisfactorily explained the plans for updating the 
pivotal  study,  and  is  to  submit  the  updated  survival  results  from  the  pivotal  study  as  a  follow  up 
measure when available.  
The addition of rituximab to the FC regimen significantly prolonged PFS when compared to the FC 
regimen alone (p < 0.0001, Log-Rank test) (Figure 1) The Kaplan-Meier estimated  median PFS was 
32.2 months  (981 days)  with  FC  and  39.8 months  (1212  days)  with  R-FC  (Table  12).  The  risk  of 
progression  or  death  was  reduced  by  44%  patients  in  the  R-FC  arm  compared  to  patients  in  the  FC 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arm.  This  risk  reduction  was  statistically  significant  (adjusted  HR  0.56;  p < 0001,  Wald  test).  Sixty 
percent of patients in the FC arm and 77% in the R-FC arm had not progressed or died at two years.

At  the  time  of  the  main  analysis  (clinical  cut-off  July 4,  2007),  a  total  of  81  patients  had  died: 
48 patients (11.8%) in the FC arm and 33 patients (8.2%) in the R-FC arm. After a median follow-up 
time of 20.7 months and under a nominal significance level α = 0.05 (2-sided), overall survival in the 
R-FC  arm  was  significantly  improved  compared  to  the  FC  arm  (p = 0.0427,  Log-rank  test).  The 
median survival times could not be estimated for both treatment arms. Treatment with R-FC reduced 
the  risk  of  death  by  36%  when  compared  to  FC  alone  (adjusted  HR  0.64;  95% CI  [0.41;  1.00], 
p = 0.0427,  Wald  test).  Eighty-six  percent  of  patients  (350/407)  in  the  FC  arm  and  93%  of  patients

(376/403) in the R-FC arm were alive at 12 months, 2-year survival rates were 92% in the R-FC group 
compared to 87% in the FC group. 
The additional analysis with 4.8 months longer follow-up (cut-off date of February 8, 2008) did not 
show a statistical significant effect, but confirmed overall the trend in favour of treatment with R-FC. 
The Kaplan-Meier graph of overall survival is provided in Figure 2.

In  study  ML17102,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  an  objective  response  (CR  +  nPR  +  PR)  was 
significantly  higher  in  the  R-FC  arm  (86.1%)  compared  to  the  FC  arm  (72.7%)  (p < 0.0001, 
Chi-square test). The complete response rate was doubled in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm 
(36.0% versus 17.2%) (p < 0.0001, Chi-square test). 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  achieved  molecular  remission  (i.e.,  patients  achieving  a  clinical 
remission  [CR]  without  evidence  of  minimal  residual  disease  [MRD]  measured  by  flow  cytometry) 
was higher in patients who received R-FC compared with patients who received FC.

In  order  to  assess  the  impact  of  potential  prognostic  factors  on  the  treatment  effect,  baseline 
characteristics were analyzed. Risk ratios with 95% CI (R-FC vs. FC) for patient subgroups based on 
baseline  factors  are  shown  for  progression-free  survival  in  Figure  7.  Overall,  the  results  of  the  PFS 
subgroup  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  results  seen  in  the  overall  ITT  population.  The  risk  of 
disease  progression  or  death  was  reduced  in  the  R-FC  arm  compared  to  the  FC  arm  in  most  of  the 
subgroups  analyzed,  except  for  patients  older  than  70  years  and  those  who  were  diagnosed  6-<  12 
months before study entry.

Of particular interest were subgroups of patients based on Binet stage at baseline (stratification factor) 
and more detailed analyses on these subgroups are shown below. Of note, in general the study was not 
powered  to  show  significant  differences  in  subgroups.  In  all  subgroups  analyzed  according  to  Binet 
stage, the risk of disease progression or death was decreased by the addition of rituximab to FC when 
compared to FC alone. The effect was most pronounced in the group of patients with stage A disease 
(not  adjusted  HR  0.13,  95%  CI  [0.03;  0.61];  p  =  0.0093)  and  stage  B  disease  (HR  0.46,  95%  CI 
[0.32;0.63]; p < 0.0001), whereas the risk reduction in patients in stage C disease was less pronounced 
(not  adjusted  HR  0.88,  95%  CI  [0.58;  1.33];  p  =  0.5406).  A  potential  explanation  for  the  lower 
treatment effect observed in the subgroup of Binet stage C patients when compared to the Binet stage 
A or B patients may be the observation that certain prognostic biomarkers, mainly IgVH mutational 
status and ZAP-70 expression, were imbalanced between treatment arms in the Binet C subgroup with 
more  patients  on  the  R-FC  arm  expressing  these  adverse  prognostic  factors,  whereas  most  of  the 
biomarkers were relatively balanced in subgroups of patients with Binet stage A or B disease. In Binet 
stage C patients, more patients in the R-FC group had un-mutated IgVH (46% FC, 59% R-FC) or were 
ZAP-70+  (33%  FC,  41%  R-FC)  compared  to  the  FC  arm  (i.e.  had  worse  prognostic  features  than 
patients  in  the  FC  arm.  As  the  subgroup  analysis  shows  that  Binet  stage  C  patients  did  not  benefit 
statistically  significantly  from  the  addition  of  rituximab  to  chemotherapy  (R-FC),  and  also  since 
patients with Binet stage C experienced more safety problems due to rituximab, the risk balance in this 
sub group I doubtful. Thus adequate information with respect to treatment of patients with Binet stage 
C with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy has been requested to be put into the SPC.

Supportive studies 
As shown in the table in the start of the clinical section rituximab has been investigated in combination 
with other chemotherapies in both previously untreated and treated patients with CLL. Given the fact 
that most of these studies are conducted by independent investigators and are provided as publications 
only the most important findings is summarized here.  These trials are phase II studies and some of 
them  retrospective  series.  The  studies  are  summarised  in  the  Clinical  AR  and  the  data  can  only  be 
supportive. Median PFS in previously untreated patients ranged from around 32 months to 40 months. 
Median  duration  of  response  for  previously  untreated,  responding  patients  ranged  from  34  to  80 
months,  and  for  relapsed/refractory,  responding  patients  from  12  to  36  months.  The  wide  range  of 
median PFS and duration of response (DR) results across studies may be due to the different nature of 
the studies (e.g. different durations of follow up, different baseline characteristics and different patient 
populations).  Overall  response  rates  for  rituximab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  previously 
untreated  patients  were  high  and  consistent  across  studies  and  ranged  from  77%  (sequential 
administration of rituximab after fludarabine) to 97% (rituximab in combination with FCM). Complete 
response rates ranged from 15% (sequential fludarabine followed by rituximab) to 77% (rituximab in 
combination with FCM). In previously treated patients, overall response rates were similarly high and 
ranged  from  65%  (rituximab  in  combination  with  bendamustine)  to  94%  (rituximab  in  combination 
with  PCM).  In  the  retrospective  analysis  by  Wierda et  althea  overall  response  rate  was  significantly 
higher for patients who had received R-FC compared with patients who had received F (p=0.008), but 
not compared to patients who received FC. However, the proportion of CRs was significantly higher 
in patients in the R-FC cohort compared to patients in the F and FC cohorts (p<0.05). 
In conclusion, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy seems to produce high response rates and 
PFS comparable to the results of the pivotal phase III study. 
2. 2.   Clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety information for the proposed indication in CLL is mainly based on data from 
the  phase  III  study  ML17102  sponsored  by  Roche  and  conducted  in  collaboration  with  the  German 
CLL Study Group. The 11 investigator sponsored studies have reported limited safety information. 
Patient exposure 
In study ML17102 a total of 397 patients with CLL received at least one treatment cycle of rituximab 
(in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). Supplementary safety data in CLL patients 
is available from several phase II trials of rituximab in combination with FC or other chemotherapy 
treatment regimens. The total number of patients treated with rituximab in these phase II studies was 
498 previously untreated patients (who required therapy) and 411 previously treated patients. 
ML17102 is main safety database. In the R-FC arm, more patients received six cycles of therapy (i.e., 
at  least  one  component  of  cycle  treatment)  compared  to  the  FC  arm  (75%  [299/397]  vs.  69% 
[273/396]).  This  difference  was  mainly  due  to  a  higher  number  of  patients  in  the  FC  arm  with 
insufficient  response  at  interim  staging  or  withdrawals  for  administrative  reasons.  Of  those  patients 
treated with R-FC, 75% received all six doses of rituximab. Most patients in the R-FC arm received at 
least 90% of the planned dose of rituximab (at each cycle between 82% and 95% of patients).  
Adverse events 
At the time of the clinical cut-off July 4, 2007, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs and SAEs was higher 
in the R-FC arm, ´Table 8, while the number of all deaths was higher in the FC arm. AEs leading to 
dose modifications were more frequent in the R-FC arm than the FC arm. However, AEs leading to 
treatment  discontinuation  occurred  with  the  same  frequency  in  both  arms  (18%).  Importantly,  there 
was  no  difference  in  the  rate  of  deaths  considered  related  to  therapy.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of 
rituximab in CLL was consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab used in combination with 
chemotherapy in other indications. No new safety signals related to rituximab appeared in this study.

Safety  information  from  the  phase  II  studies  of  rituximab  in  combination  with  a  variety  of 
chemotherapy  regimens  as  described  in  journal  articles  or  conference  abstracts.  The  publications 
mainly focus on the most commonly reported events such as severe infections, neutropenia, anaemia 
and thrompocytopenia. 
Overall,  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  a  grade 3  or  4  adverse  event  in  study  ML17102  was 
higher in the R-FC arm (77%) compared to the FC arm (62%). 
The  most  common  system  organ  classes  for  grade 3  or  4  AEs  were  ‘blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders’ and ‘infections and infestations’ (each ≥ 10% incidence). 
Table 5 Grade 3 or 4 AEs that occurred with an at least 2% higher incidence in one of the treatment 
arms were: 
19% and 30% in the FC arm and R-FC arm, respectively 
12% and 23% 
Higher incidence in the R-FC arm versus the FC arm: 
–  Neutropenia: 
–  Leukopenia:  
–  Febrile neutropenia:               6% and 9% 
–  Pancytopenia: 
1% and 3% 
Higher incidence in the FC arm versus the R-FC arm: 
–  Thrombocytopenia:              10% and 7% in the FC arm and R-FC arm, respectively 
–  Anaemia:  
–  Pyrexia: 
7% and 4% 
5% and 3% 
The  proportion  of  patients  reported  as  having  at  least  one  grade  3  or  4  infection  or  infestation  was 
balanced between treatment arms (17% in the FC arm vs. 18% in the R-FC arm). Infection AEs with 
an incidence of at least 1% were pneumonia, herpes zoster, sepsis, bronchitis, infection, sinusitis and 
neutropenic infection.  
The overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was balanced between treatment arms (3% vs. 
4%),  however,  more  patients  in  the  R-FC  arm  (six patients  [2%])  experienced  grade 3  or  4  angina 
pectoris compared to the FC arm (one patient). One additional FC patient had a grade 2 SAE of angina 
pectoris. All eight patients the event resolved without sequelae.  
In  the  FC  arm,  only  one  patient  experienced  an  immune  system  disorder  (grade  4  SAE  of 
hypersensitivity)  compared  to  12  patients  (3%)  in  the  R-FC  arm.  These  12  patients  experienced 
hypersensitivity (six patients, all with grade 3 events, three were serious), anaphylactic reactions (one 
grade 3 AE and one grade 4 SAE), drug hypersensitivity (two patients with grade 3 SAEs), allergic 
oedema (one patient, grade 3) and cytokine release syndrome (one patient, grade 4 SAE). In seven of 
the 12 patients these events occurred during or within 24 hours of a rituximab infusion. All patients 
with  immune  system  disorders  received  treatment  for  the  events,  all  of  which  resolved  without 
sequelae. The patients all continued in the study.  
In both arms the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs per treatment cycle was highest during cycle 1 
and then decreased to the lowest incidence during cycle 6. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
At the time of the data cut, 80/793 patients in the safety population (10%) had died. There were more 
deaths in the FC arm (47/396 [12%]) compared to the R-FC arm (33/397 [8%]). The  most common 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
causes  of  death  were  infections  (19  patients  [5%]  vs.  12  patients  [3%])  and  neoplasms  (14  patients 
[4%]  vs.  10  patients  [3%],  including  CLL  and  related  disorders).  Five  patients  in  the  FC  arm  and 
three patients  in  the  R-FC  arm  (approximately  1%)  died  due  to  a  cardiac  disorder.  The  underlying 
cause of death was considered to be progressive disease in 42 patients (25 [6.3%] in the FC arm and 
17 [4.2%] in the R-FC arm). In these patients the investigator reported the (underlying) cause of death 
from  infection  or  others  causes  to  be  CLL,  CLL  transformation,  disease  progression,  neoplasm 
progression,  acute  myeloid  leukaemia,  metastases  to  the  central  nervous  system,  Hodgkin’s  disease, 
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or B-cell small lymphocytic leukaemia. Most of those patients 
whose death was related to progressive disease developed an infection and died (13 patients in the FC 
arm and eight in the R-FC arm).  
Of the 38 patients who died due to causes not related to disease progression, eight FC patients and six 
R-FC  patients  died  from  infections.  The  most  common  infection  adverse  events  resulting  in  death 
were sepsis (five patients in each arm, including bacterial sepsis, pulmonary sepsis and septic shock).  
In  8/396  FC  patients  (2%)  and  6/397  R-FC  patients  (2%),  the  investigator  judged  the  death  to  be 
related  to  study  treatment.  However,  one  of  these,  died  on  study  day  658  after  starting  second  line 
therapy (R-CHOP). The investigator reported an AE of lung infection remotely related to (second line) 
treatment. With the exception of sepsis/septic shock (two patients in each arm), the treatment-related 
fatal events were single occurrences.  
A total of 550 SAEs in 344 patients were reported across the two arms. A slightly higher incidence of 
serious  adverse  events  was  observed  in  the  R-FC  arm  (46%)  compared  to  the  FC  arm  (41%).  This 
difference was driven by more events in the following body systems: infections and infestations (15% 
in  the  FC  arm  vs.  18%  in  the  R-FC  arm),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (11%  vs.  17%), 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (2%  vs.  4%)  and  immune  system  disorders  (one  patient  vs.  seven  patients 
[2%]). In other body systems, no meaningful imbalance was evident. 
Although blood and lymphatic system disorders were overall the most commonly reported grade 3 or 
4  AEs  in  both  arms  ),  the  majority  of  these  events  were  not  serious.  In  the  FC  arm,  the  overall 
incidence  of  grade  3  or  4  AEs  reported  in  this  system  organ  class  was  41%,  while  the  incidence  of 
serious  events  was  11%.  In  the  R-FC  arm,  57%  of  patients  experienced  grade  3  or  4  blood  and 
lymphatic system disorders, but only 17% had a serious event. The most common serious blood and 
lymphatic system event was febrile neutropenia (reported in 6% and 8% of patients in the FC arm and 
R-FC arm, respectively).  
Most  reported  infection  AEs,  on  the  other  hand,  were  considered  serious.  Seventeen  percent  of  FC 
patients had a grade 3 or 4 infection during the study, and 15% had a serious infection. In the R-FC 
arm 73 patients (18%) had a grade 3 or 4 infection, and 71 patients (18%) had a serious infection. A 
total  of  68 serious  infection  events  were  reported  in  the  FC  arm  compared  to  91 serious  infection 
events  in  the  R-FC  arm.  The  difference  between  the  treatment  arms  could  not  be  attributed  to  a 
specific cluster of infections, but events were distributed across various groups of underlying agents, 
Other  system  organ  classes  where  SAEs  were  reported  with  an  at  least  2  percentage  points  higher 
incidence in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm included gastrointestinal disorders (2% in the FC 
arm vs. 4% in the R-FC arm) and immune system disorders (one patient vs. seven patients [2%]). The 
seven R-FC patients with immune system disorders experienced hypersensitivity (three patients), drug 
hypersensitivity  (two  patients),  anaphylactic  reaction  and  cytokine  release  syndrome  (one  patient 
each).  
Laboratory findings 
Overall,  more  patients  in  the  R-FC  group  experienced  blood  and  lymphatic  system  AEs.  Consistent 
with  this,  the  most  common  grade 3  and  4  haematological  laboratory  abnormalities  reported  were 
neutropenia (65% FC; 78% R-FC), lymphocytopenia (73% FC; 87% R-FC), and leukopenia (57% FC; 
81%  R-FC).  However,  thrombocytopenia  (15%  FC;  12%  R-FC)  was  less  frequent  in  the  R-FC  arm 
and anaemia was about the same in the two arms (10% FC, 12% R-FC). These findings are consistent 
with  the  incidence  of  grade 3  and  4  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia  reported  as  AEs.  However, 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these cytopenias were not associated with an increase in grade 3 or 4 infections in the R-FC arm (18%) 
compared to the FC arm (17%). 
The  increased  incidence  of  lymphopenia  in  the  R-FC  arm  was  entirely  expected  and  related  to  the 
mechanism of action of rituximab – B-cell depletion, which is a desirable effect in patients with CLL. 
Leukopenia and neutropenia were also expected to be more frequent in the R-FC arm compared to the 
FC  arm,  since  this  is  well  recognized  in  patients  treated  with  rituximab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy for NHL. The slight differences in incidence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia between 
the  two  arms  are  probably  due  to  chance  although  the  lower  rate  of  thrombocytopenia  in  patients 
treated with R-FC could be related to improved disease control. 
No significant changes in biochemistry parameters were detected in this study. 
In both treatment arms, median levels of IgG and IgA at BL were above the lower limit of normal (7 
g/L and 0.7 g/L, respectively) and remained so during and after treatment. 
The median levels of IgM at baseline were slightly lower than normal in both arms (0.36 g/L for FC, 
0.36 g/L for R-FC; LLN = 0.4 g/L) at BL. In the FC arm, the median IgM levels increased to above 
the  LLN  (0.4  g/L)  during  treatment,  whereas  in  the  R-FC  arm  median  levels  remained  stable  and 
slightly below the LLN. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety analyses were performed on subgroups based on patient age, creatinine clearance, Binet stage at 
BL,  Cumulative  Illness  Rating  Scale  (CIRS)  score  at  BL,  and  lymphocyte  counts.  As  expected,  the 
proportion  of  patients  experiencing  a  grade 3  or  4  AE  increased  with  age  in  both  arms.  As  in  the 
overall safety population, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 events was higher in the R-FC arm compared 
to the FC arm for all age categories. The proportion of patients experiencing at least one serious AE in 
the R-FC arm increased with age (from 43% for patients <65 years to 52% for those ≥65 to 70 years 
and 53% for those >70 years), whereas in the FC arm the proportion was approximately 40% in all age 
groups. Surprisingly, the incidence of SAEs of the blood and lymphatic system actually declined in the 
FC control arm with increasing age, so that the difference between the two arms appeared to become 
more marked with increasing age. This difference between treatment arms was mostly due to a higher 
rate of serious infections and serious blood and lymphatic system disorders in R-FC patients above 65 
years of age. The rate of deaths from infections did not increase with age. 
There was no relevant difference in the death rate in patient subgroups by age. 
In Binet B and C patients, the rates of grade 3 or 4 AEs were higher in the R-FC arm compared to the 
FC arm. In both arms, the rate of grade 3 or 4 AEs slightly increased from patients with Binet stage B 
to those with Binet stage C (Binet B: 57% FC vs. 74% R-FC; Binet C: 71% FC vs. 83% R-FC), but the 
difference between the treatment arms remained stable. 
The rate of SAEs increased with more advanced disease stage in the FC group, but not in the R-FC 
group, in which SAEs rates remained relatively constant across all subgroups according to Binet stage. 
However, adequate information and possible restrictions and conditions has been requested to be put 
into the SPC section 5.1 with respect to treatment of Binet stage C patients. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AEs  was  the  same  in  both 
treatment arms (70 patients [18%] in the FC arm, 71 patients [18%] in the R-FC arm). Almost all of 
these events were of grade 3 or 4 intensity. Consistent with the overall pattern of adverse events, the 
most common AEs that led to treatment discontinuation were blood and lymphatic system  disorders 
(10% vs. 12%), such as neutropenia (2% vs. 4%), thrombocytopenia (3% vs. 2%), leukopenia (< 1% 
vs. 2%) and related terms (two patients and three patients in the FC arm and R-FC arm, respectively, 
with events of neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count/white blood cell count decreased or 
platelet count/platelet count decreased).

As described in section 4.4 of the SmPC:  
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur 
during therapy with MabThera (see section 4.8). 
MabThera should not be administered to patients 
with an active and/or severe infection (eg. 
tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, 
see section 4.3) or severely immunocompromised 
patients (eg. in hypogammaglobulinemia or where 
levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians 
should exercise caution when considering the use 
of MabThera in patients with a history of recurring 
or chronic infections or with underlying conditions 
which may further predispose patients to serious 
infection (see section 4.8).  
Patients reporting signs and symptoms of infection 
following MabThera therapy should be promptly 
evaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving 
a subsequent course of MabThera treatment, 
patients should be re-evaluated for any potential 
risk for infections. 
As described in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC:

Method of Administration 
Premedication with glucocorticoids should be 
considered if MabThera is not given in 
combination with glucocorticoid-containing 
chemotherapy for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s

Immunomodulatory drugs may increase the risk of 
malignancy. On the basis of limited experience 
with MabThera in rheumatoid arthritis patients 
(see section 4.8) a possible risk for the 
development of solid tumours cannot be excluded 
at this time, although present data do not seem to

Lactation 
Whether rituximab is excreted in human milk is 
not known. However, because maternal IgG is 
excreted in human milk, and rituximab was 
detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women 
should not breastfeed while treated with 
MabThera and for 12 months following MabThera 
treatment.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
There are no data on the safety of MabThera in 
patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class 
III) or severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. 
In patients treated with MabThera, the occurrence 
of pre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions 
becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, 
has been observed, as well as atrial fibrillation and 
flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac 
history, the risk of cardiovascular complications 
resulting from infusion reactions should be 
considered before treatment with MabThera and 
patients closely monitored during administration. 
Since hypotension may occur during MabThera 
infusion, consideration should be given to 
withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 
hours prior to the MabThera infusion.

The safety of immunization with any vaccine,

MabThera therapy has not been studied for NHL 
and CLL patients. The ability to generate a 
primary or anamnestic humoral response to any 
vaccine has also not been studied. 
The SmPC already includes information on blood 
and bone marrow system disorders (without 
reference to age categories): 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Although MabThera is not myelosuppressive in 
monotherapy, caution should be exercised when 
considering treatment of patients with neutrophils 
< 1.5 x 109/l and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/l as 
clinical experience in this population is limited. 
MabThera has been used in 21 patients who 
underwent autologous bone marrow 
transplantation and other risk groups with a 
presumable reduced bone marrow function 
without inducing myelotoxicity. 
See recommendations for infections above 
There are no known ways of reducing the risk of 
treatment-related secondary AML/MDS, other 
than by reducing exposure to chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy and/or by substituting a less DNA-
damaging agent, if possible (e.g. substitution of 
ABVD for MOPP chemotherapy in Hodgkin’s

BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
The  MAH  has  provided  a  large  well-designed  phase  III  clinical  study  comparing  FC  with 
FC+rituximab in a population of patients with CD20-positive B-CLL. A pre-planned interim analysis 
showed  superior  efficacy  for  the  primary  endpoint  PFS  demonstrated  in  favour  of  the  rituximab 
containing combination. Overall survival benefit is rarely observed in CLL clinical trials, however a 
positive effect on OS was also been shown for the FC-R regimen.  Thus the DSMB concluded that the 
interim analysis was adequate to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating the effect of the rituximab 
combination treatment 
This clinical trial is itself sufficient documentation for clinical benefit and pivotal for approval of the 
extended indication for MabThera. 
The median observation time of 20.7 months for the pivotal trial ML17102 is fairly short for a CLL 
population. Data from an additional ‘snapshot’ analysis (based on a clinical cut-off February 8, 2008) 
adding 4.8 months to the median observation time  show persistence of the efficacy in terms of PFS 
and  OS.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  provide  annual  updates  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  study 
ML17072, progression-free survival (PFS), and for the secondary endpoint overall survival (OS) in the 
4th quarter of 2009 and in the 4th quarter of 2010 which is considered appropriate. 
Subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint of Binet stages demonstrate benefit in all stages, however, 
the outcome in patients with Binet stage C did not reach statistical significance and the clinical benefit 
was less compared to stage B (Stage B: unadjusted HR 0.45, 95% CI [0.32; 0.63]; Stage C: unadjusted 
HR  0.88,  95%  CI  [0.58;1.33])  The  study  was  not  powered  to  show  significant  differences  in 
subgroups. Of note, in this subgroup, there was a higher proportion of patients (difference of 8-13% 
between the two arms) with unfavorable prognostic biomarkers such as unmutated IgVH and ZAP70-
positivity in the R-FC arm than in the FC arm. However, adequate information was included into the 
SPC section 5.1. 
Similar  positive  benefits  were  seen  for  rituximab  added  to  a  range  of  other  cytotoxic  chemotherapy 
regimens  in  patients  with  CLL.  These  data  were  mainly presented  as  publications  but  in  the  CHMP 
opinion  is  sufficient  evidence  to  support  the  broad  indication  “MabThera  is  indicated  for  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  chronic 
in  combination  with 
chemotherapy.” 
leukaemia  (CLL) 
lymphocytic 
Overall, the risks of rituximab in CLL patients were comparable to known safety profiles of rituximab 
used  in  approved  indications  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  regimens  and 
marketed  experience  for  more  than  10  years.  In  particular,  higher  incidences  of  neutropenia, 
leukopenia, febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia were also seen in patients treated with rituximab for 
NHL. There were no new safety signals observed in both the pivotal trial and the supportive studies.  
The addition of rituximab  did not increase the rate of treatment discontinuations or the incidence of 
treatment related deaths compared to FC alone.  
There are no safety concerns against an approval of the extended indication. 
Based on the data from three large randomized trials, FC chemotherapy is now considered by many 
CLL study groups worldwide as a standard treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL who 
can tolerate this regimen. In this application the MAH has demonstrated significant improvement of 
this  standard  therapy  by  adding  rituximab  to  chemotherapy  in  terms  of  a  clinically  important 
prolongation  of  PFS,  improved  overall  response  rate  and  a  trend  towards  improved  survival.  The

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Limited submitted on 21 November 2017 an application 
for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for DECTOVA, through the 
centralised procedure under Article 3 (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 November 2014. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration 
of interest of patients at Community level. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Dectova is indicated for the treatment of influenza A or B virus infection in hospitalised adult and 
paediatric patients (≥6 months): 
•  when circulating influenza virus is resistant to other approved anti-influenza medications, or 
resistance develops while on anti-influenza treatment, and/or 
•  who cannot take anti-influenza medications via other routes of administration 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0212/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0212/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above mentioned Regulation.

paediatric indication 
In the 2014 EMA scientific advice, the following topics were addressed 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 8/143 
 
 
 
 
 
The  adequacy  of  the  non-clinical  studies  to  support  the  IV  use  of  zanamivir,  challenging  some  of  the 
advice given in 2010 
The  changes  in  the  pivotal  trial  since  the  2010  advice.  Now  designed  as  a  randomised,  double-blind, 
double-dummy Phase III to demonstrate superiority of IV zanamivir 300mg BID or 600mg BID over the 
comparator oseltamivir 75mg BID 
The applicant’s take on the emerging body of observational data on the use of oral oseltamivir for the 
treatment  of  hospitalised  patients  with  influenza  pointing  to  its  effectiveness  in  this  population, 
specifically with regard to a mortality benefit, and the associated challenges in showing superiority of IV 
zanamivir over oral oseltamivir in the Phase III. 
The  conduct  of  a  second  interim  analysis  to  include  a  futility  analysis  with  the  hypothesis  that  if 
oseltamivir  is  indeed  efficacious,  then  IV  zanamivir  may  be  unlikely  to  be  superior  to  an  efficacious 
treatment 
The applicant’s opinion that failure to demonstrate superiority over oral Oseltamivir may not indicate lack 
of efficacy but instead may point to similar efficacy of two treatments 
The key analyses that will help define a favourable benefit-risk profile to support an MAA for IV zanamivir 
• 
Primary endpoint (time to clinical response) and a key secondary endpoint (time to respiratory 
status improvement) in a key secondary analysis 
•  Key Subgroup analyses 
•  Non-inferiority on mortality as a new secondary analysis 
The possibility to grant a MA in pre-specified subpopulations, where a clear benefit is shown, even if an 
advantage is not observed in the overall study population when compared to oseltamivir 
In the 2016 EMA scientific advice, the following topics were addressed 
The use of animal models to support efficacy against resistant influenza viruses 
The possibility to bridge efficacy from inhalation route to IV route  
The evidence base to support approval of zanamivir 600 mg BID IV for treatment of influenza 
The  possibility  to  investigate  alternative  regulatory routes  (i.e.  conditional  marketing  authorisation  or 
exceptional  circumstances)  for  approval  given  that  the  pivotal  Phase  III  study  did  not  meet  its 
pre-specified primary endpoint (time to clinical response) 
The  post-authorisation  study  to  evaluate  the  clinical  effectiveness  of  treatment  with  IV  Zanamivir  in 
subjects hospitalised in ICU with drug-resistant influenza

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza is an acute viral infection that spreads easily from person to person in any age group and that 
can cause serious complications in certain risk groups. In addition to seasonal epidemics, influenza 
pandemics can occur when a new influenza virus subtype emerges or when an animal influenza virus 
begins to spread among humans [Source: WHO/Europe influenza control and other respiratory 
pathogens]. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), seasonal influenza causes 
illness in 5–10% of the European population each year. Individuals of all age groups are affected, but 
rates of illness are highest among young children. During most influenza seasons, rates of serious illness 
and death are highest among children <2 years, individuals >65 years, and individuals at increased risk 
for complications from influenza due to chronic illnesses. Studies conducted during the 2009 influenza 
A(H1N1) pandemic indicate that morbidly obese persons (BMI ≥40) and pregnant women are also at 
greater risk for developing severe influenza disease. In addition, there are certain occupational groups at 
increased risk of acquiring zoonotic influenza, e.g. poultry and swine industry workers [Expert opinion on 
neuraminidase inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza – review of recent systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses. Stockholm: ECDC; 2017]. 
Severe influenza disease may evolve following seasonal, zoonotic or pandemic influenza, and is often 
associated with high viral load. An acute influenza infection may be complicated by otitis media, sinusitis, 
viral and bacterial pneumonia, acute lung injury, myocarditis, pericarditis, septicaemia, encephalitis, 
and/or death. In addition, influenza disease may trigger worsening of chronic medical conditions present 
before acquiring the influenza infection, especially underlying cardiopulmonary conditions and diabetes, 
and increase the risk of complications such as cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and stroke. 
Influenza viruses constantly change through two main mechanisms: 
• antigenic drift which is characterised by point mutations leading to minor and gradual antigenic changes 
in the surface haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins  
• antigenic shift caused by reassortment between human, avian and swine viruses and characterised by 
major antigenic changes in which a new HA with or without a new NA subtype is introduced into the 
human population. 
These changes, particularly those resulting from antigenic shift, can result in influenza strains that are 
immunologically distinct from the previously circulating strains, resulting in high infection rates in the 
immunologically naïve population, and may lead to the emergence of novel geographically localised 
influenza epidemics or pandemics.

Source: ECDC- Expert opinion on neuraminidase inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza, 
2017 
More severe illness and young adult age distribution are consistent features of pandemic influenza, and 
are linked to more severe lower respiratory tract involvement. Influenza viral pneumonia is more frequent 
in pandemics compared to seasonal epidemics, and more common in children and young adults compared 
to older patients, most likely related to lack of specific immunity to the newly circulating pandemic strain 
in those age groups.  
The well-documented morbidity and mortality from the 2009 influenza pandemic, and the emergence of 
two avian influenza viruses infecting humans in recent years, A/H5N1 (WHO 2008) and A/H7N9, serve to 
emphasise the continuing threat that influenza poses to public health as a result of emergence of new 
viral strains infecting populations with limited herd immunity. 
Changes in one or more influenza virus virulence determinants such as hemagglutinin (HA),viral RNA 
polymerase complex (PA, PB1, PB2), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), and non-structural protein 
1 (NS1) by either mutation (antigenic drift) or reassortment (antigenic shift) drive changes in virulence of 
influenza A viruses. Another important element in influenza virulence is tropism for lower respiratory tract 
epithelium, with the HA of pandemic strains such as 2009 A/H1N1pdm and emerging avian influenza 
viruses such as H7N9 and H5N1 showing receptor binding specificity for α(2-3) sialylated glycans that are 
expressed on bronchial epithelium. 
Current epidemiology data are available for Europe from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC). For the 2016/2017 influenza season, of all detected influenza virus, 94% are attributed 
to influenza A and 6% to influenza B. Of the influenza A virus detections, 98% are attributed to H3N2. 
Influenza B viruses were mostly of the B/Yamagata lineage. Nine countries reported a total of 7526 
laboratory-confirmed hospitalised influenza cases during the 2016–2017 influenza season.  Excess 
mortality was mainly observed in people aged 65 years or older but was also considerable among 40–
64-year-olds. There was little antiviral resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors detected (<1%). 
The number of people affected varies from year to year among countries, making it hard to predict the 
annual number of deaths or economic impact. ECDC estimates that on average nearly 40 000 people die 
prematurely each year from influenza in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries.

2.1.3.  Biologic features  
Influenza virus is a member of the orthomyxovirus family and causes an acute viral disease of the 
respiratory tract. Influenza is characterised bronchoscopically by diffuse inflammation and oedema of the 
larynx, trachea, and bronchi; mucosal biopsies show lymphocytic and histiocytic inflammatory infiltrate 
and desquamation. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Influenza virus infection can result in either acute uncomplicated illness or complicated/severe illness 
requiring medical supportive measures as defined by the WHO and other public health authorities.   
Uncomplicated influenza population:  Most patients with influenza virus infection will experience a 
self-resolving illness which usually presents abruptly with constitutional and respiratory signs and 
symptoms, including fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion.  
Typically, symptoms last for 7 to 10 days and improve without significant morbidity.   
Complicated/severe/hospitalised influenza: As complicated/severe influenza is defined by the need 
for hospital admission for clinical management, the terms complicated, severe and hospitalised influenza 
are used interchangeably. Complicated influenza is defined by the need for hospitalisation for clinical 
management, symptoms and signs of lower respiratory tract infection, central nervous system 
involvement, severe dehydration, presenting secondary complications or exacerbation of underlying 
chronic disease.  Risk factors include pregnancy, age > 65 years or < 5 years, chronic medical diseases 
such as diabetes, kidney, liver, neurological, lung and cardiac disease, compromised immune system and 
morbid obesity. 
Severe influenza predominantly involves localisation of virus to the LRT with resultant complications.  
These complications include viral pneumonia, respiratory failure, ARDS, as well as exacerbation of 
underlying lung diseases (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) involving the bronchi and 
small airways. According to the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic H1N1 2009 Influenza, 
pathologic findings at death among hospitalised patients with pandemic H1N1 showed pulmonary 
histologic findings dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Bacterial pneumonia, usually caused by 
Staphylococcus aureus (often methicillin resistant), Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes 
and other bacteria, were diagnosed in 20 to 24% of ICU patients and found in 26 to 38% of patients who 
died during the 2009/2010 pandemic. Patients with severe immunosuppression were at increased risk for 
protracted viral replication and pneumonia. Cases of neurologic manifestations, myocarditis, myositis and 
rhabdomyolysis with some fulminant cases were also reported. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There remain very limited options for treatment of influenza, with only two classes of approved antiviral 
medicines: the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) 
(zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, laninamivir). High level of resistance in influenza A strains has 
changed treatment guidelines and the use of adamantanes is no longer recommended. 
The NAIs zanamivir and oseltamivir were introduced in the late 1990s and act by inhibiting viral cleavage 
of sialic acid from the cell surface glycoconjugates of infected cells, preventing viral spread in the 
respiratory tract. Neuraminidase inhibitors have antiviral activity against all subtypes of influenza A and 
influenza B strains. IV peramivir has recently been approved for the treatment of influenza in a small 
number of countries based on studies of single infusion treatment in outpatients with uncomplicated 
influenza. A marketing authorisation application (MAA) was submitted in the European Union (EU) for IV 
peramivir in early 2017. Laninamivir, an inhaled NAI is approved in a limited number of countries. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 14/143 
 
 
 
All EU Member States recommend neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), in combination with clinical 
supportive care, for treatment of severe, complicated or progressive illness, or for patients at high risk of 
complications, irrespective of vaccination status. NAI use is recommended as treatment or prophylaxis for 
residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities at risk of severe disease. A minority of 
EU/EEA Member States recommend use as treatment or prophylaxis for outpatients who may have a 
higher risk of severe outcomes of influenza (young children, elderly or individuals of any age with 
underlying chronic illnesses). 
Many EU/EEA Member States maintain a stockpile of influenza antivirals as capsules or powder for use 
during influenza pandemics. 
According to ECDC, in general, influenza viruses have been susceptible to the two NAIs available for 
treatment in the EU/EEA over the past ten years. However, during the 2007–2008 influenza season, an 
oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) strain emerged in Europe and was later detected throughout the 
world. This virus strain remained susceptible to zanamivir. Fortunately, this resistant strain has not 
circulated worldwide since the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic virus became dominant. Based on an 
analysis of 11 387 influenza viruses circulating globally in 2012–2013, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09, 
A(H3N2), B/Victoria-or B/Yamagata-lineage viruses with reduced or highly reduced susceptibility was low 
(1%, 0.4%, 1% and 0.3%, respectively) to one or more of the NAIs tested (oseltamivir, zanamivir, 
peramivir and laninamivir). Even in parts of Asia, e.g. Japan, where use of antivirals has been significantly 
greater than in the EU/EEA Member States, the level of antiviral resistance is low. 
There is an unmet need for additional treatments of seasonal, avian and pandemic influenza, especially in 
critically ill hospitalised patients and risk groups including immunocompromised subjects. Dectova being 
administered by intravenous infusion may be a valuable supplement to the existing treatments, especially 
when strains that are resistant to other antivirals are circulating. 
About the product 
Zanamivir 10 mg/ml solution for infusion (referred throughout as IV Zanamivir) is an aqueous formulation 
that was developed originally to support the nonclinical safety assessment and Phase 1 clinical studies of 
RELENZA inhalation powder. In 2005 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approached 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to initiate a development programme of the aqueous formulation of Zanamivir for 
treatment of severe influenza in response to the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian threat and concern over 
oseltamivir resistance. This formulation could be administered by nebulisation or IV administration. While 
there was interest in both methods of administration, public health agencies were most supportive of the 
need for an IV formulation. This development programme was fully initiated subsequent to the onset of 
the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic amid mounting recognition of the compelling public health basis for 
development of parenteral anti-influenza medications. Furthermore, there was also a need for a NAI with 
the ability to treat hospitalised patients with influenza viruses resistant to oseltamivir or peramivir 
following seasonal H1N1 oseltamivir resistance observed from 2007-2009. 
In parallel to the clinical development programme, GSK initiated a global Compassionate Use Programme 
(CUP) in May 2009 at the request of the FDA and public health agencies. In February 2010, the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion on the compassionate use of IV 
Zanamivir in accordance with Article 83 of regulation (EC) 726/2004. To date over 3,000 patients have 
been treated in the CUP. 
Zanamivir hydrate 10 mg/ml solution for infusion (IV Zanamivir hydrate) is a clear, colourless, single use 
sterile preparation containing 10 mg/ml Zanamivir hydrate. Tonicity is adjusted with sodium chloride. No 
buffers or preservatives are included in the formulation. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 15/143 
 
 
 
Zanamivir hydrate does not undergo biotransformation and is eliminated as unchanged drug by renal 
excretion.  The recommended dose of IV zanamivir for adults (age ≥ 18 years) with normal renal function 
(creatinine clearance greater or equal to 80 ml/min) is 600 mg given twice daily. Adolescents, children 
and infants with normal renal function should receive a weight-based dose. The recommended initial 
treatment course is for 5 days. Physicians should consider extending the initial 5-day treatment course for 
up to 5 additional days if ongoing viral shedding is detected or if clinical symptoms warrant further 
treatment.  
At time of submission of the Marketing Authorisation Application, the proposed indication was treatment 
of influenza A or B virus infection in hospitalised adult and paediatric patients (≥6 months); when 
circulating influenza virus is resistant to other approved anti-influenza medications, or resistance 
develops while on anti-influenza treatment, and/or who cannot take anti-influenza medications via other 
routes of administration.    
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above mentioned Regulation for a proposed 
restricted indication based on the following: 
– 
Influenza virus that is resistant to other approved anti-influenza medications occurs so rarely that 
it is not feasible to conduct clinical studies in this patient population 
–  Currently, there is a significant gap in the scientific knowledge of a commercially available test for 
real-time identification of influenza resistance 
– 
It is not feasible to conduct controlled clinical studies in a patient population who can only be 
administered anti-influenza medication via the IV route as there are no anti-influenza IV 
medications approved for hospitalised patients in the European Union 
–  Unethical to conduct a placebo-controlled study in this extremely sick patient population 
The applicant was of the opinion that by restricting the indicated patient population to a population that 
is not currently served by available anti-influenza therapies, the marketing authorisation application falls 
within the scope of the exceptional circumstances legislation.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Full documentation for the active substance has been provided. The active substance has a monograph in 
the Ph. Eur.  
The active substance is the same as the substance previously approved for applicant’s product Relenza 
inhalation powderexcept that in the present application the substance is not micronised, the limit for any 
other impurities has been tightened and a limit for endotoxins has been added to the present active 
substance specification, and the retest period has been increased. The removal of the micronisation step 
is considered acceptable given the use of dissolved active substance in Dectova. Relenza was first 
approved nationally in Sweden 1999 and has subsequently been approved in most EEA countries (except 
from CY and LI) through mutual recognition procedure SE/H/0180.  
The active substance is zanamivir hydrate. Zanamivir is the INN of the anhydrous substance which 
according to Ph. Eur. has the chemical name 
(2R,3R,4S)-3-(acetylamino)-4-carbamimidoylamino-2-[(1R,2R)-1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl]-3,4-dihydro-2
H-pyran-6-carboxylic acid. The hydrate has the molecular formula C12H20N4O7, x H20 and the structure 
shown below: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The molecular mass for the anhydrous substance is 332.3. It is a chiral substance with five stereogenic 
carbons which arise from the proposed starting material. Stereoisomerism is controlled by specific optical 
rotation in the starting material and the active substance. Absolute configuration of the stereochemical 
centres is indicated in the chemical name. 
The chemical structure of zanamivir hydrate was confirmed by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, UV 
spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to off-white hygroscopic powder. At room temperature aqueous solubility 
is approximately 16 mg/ml and solubility in saline (intravenous formulation) approximately 18 mg/ml. 
Aqueous solubility increases somewhat towards lower and higher pH values. It is amphoteric and is 
partially ionised over the whole pH range. The measured pK a for the acid group is 2.4 and for the 
guanidine moiety 12.9. Zanamivir reversibly adsorbs water. 
Two hydrate forms of the active substance have been identified; a non-stoichiometric hydrate (hydrate 1) 
and a stoichiometric hydrate (hydrate 2). Hydrate 1 is the solid state form consistently produced by the 
proposed synthetic route and is the selected form for the manufacture of Dectova.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured using a 5 chemical synthesis steps. The QP declarations provided 
for the active substance manufacturers are acceptable. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 17/143 
 
 
 
  
The manufacturing process may be performed by two routes, C and D. These are the same as those 
registered for zanamivir in Relenza inhalation powder. Route D was developed to avoid the use of azide 
chemistry. 
Both routes consist of 5 chemical transformations with isolated intermediates using commercially 
available raw materials with acceptable specifications, followed by hydrate conversion in the last step. 
Purified water used in the final steps complies with note for guidance on quality of water for 
pharmaceutical use. 
No rework for the intermediates has been established. 
Critical operations have been identified Investigation of critical process parameters ranges have been 
described. In-process control tests are specified. Specifications are provided for all intermediates.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin. Control of impurities in 
specifications for starting material, reagents and intermediates was also discussed. Routes C and D have 
been assessed for mutagenic impurities in accordance with ICH M7. A summary of the mutagenic 
impurities associated with routes C and D and their control strategies has been provided. 
Three mutagenic impurities which are not included in the Ph. Eur. monograph have been identified. These 
are controlled in active substance intermediates and the limits applied have been justified by purge 
studies. EP impurity F is controlled at active substance level. 
The finished product is administered as a maximum daily dose of 1.2 g and has a dosing regimen of less 
than 1 month. Therefore, the TTC for individual mutagenic impurities is 120 mcg/day, which corresponds 
to a TTC-based acceptable limit of 100 mcg/g for any individual mutagenic impurity. 
The control strategies and data presented from spiking and purging studies conclude that there is 
negligible risk of mutagenic impurities in the active substance exceeding the TTC-based acceptable limit 
and demonstrates that the levels of mutagenic impurities potentially present in zanamivir active 
substance are well controlled. Furthermore it has been confirmed that active substance from routes C and 
D will not be mixed and therefore not all the impurities will be present simultaneously in any single batch 
of the finished product at a given time. 
With regards to the manufacturing process development, as indicated above, the active substance was 
approved for the product Relenza through the mutual recognition procedure SE/H/0180. The active 
substance for Dectova is manufactured by the same routes although the final micronisation step is not 
performed. Description of development studies including information on change in manufacturing sites, 
manufacturing scale and manufacturing process approved for the product Relenza through variations 
have been presented.  
The materials of the container closure system of the active substance comply with EU Commission 
Regulation No. 10/2011 for food contact use and Ph. Eur. 3.1.3.  
Specification 
The active substance specification is in accordance with the Ph. Eur. monograph with some additional 
tests. The specification is based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). The specification 
includes tests for identity (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), loss 
on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), acetate content (GC), water content 
(KF) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).  
Dectova assessment report

Page 18/143 
 
 
 
Residual solvents are limited in the specification in line with ICH Q3C. 
The absence of specific tests for heavy metals in the specification for zanamivir active substance has been 
discussed and justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described.  In-house analytical methods for residual 
solvents by GC, related substances by HPLC and water content by Karl Fisher have been described and 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Comparable batch results, obtained by the Ph. Eur. 
zanamivir hydrate method and the in-house method for related substances, for three batches have been 
presented.  
Working standards are used for quantification which have been compared to the Ph. CRS standards.  
Complying batch data has been provided for both active substance manufactured by route Cand active 
substance manufactured by route D . The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored 
in a container closure system representative of that proposed for use in routine bulk storage and transport 
for up to 108 months (3 batches from route C) and 36 months (3 batches from route D) under long term 
conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) (3 
batches from each route) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following 
the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, impurities and water. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. No significant changes were observed for 
any of the tested parameters under long term, accelerated and photo stability studies. 
Forced degradation studies to verify the suitability of the HPLC method for zanamivir content and related 
impurities have been performed. The conditions used were heating in aqueous solution, heating in acid, 
heating in base and exposure to light. No evidence of interference of impurity peaks with the active 
substance peak was observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 108 months when stored up 
to 30 °C in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The proposed commercial product is a clear, colourless single use solution for infusion preparation 
containing zanamivir (as hydrate) 10 mg/ml. Each single-use vial contains 20 ml of solution, containing 
200 mg zanamivir. The product may be diluted prior to infusion.  
 The excipients are sodium chloride for tonicity adjustment and water for injections. Both excipients are 
of Ph. Eur. quality. The formulation is not buffered or preserved. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
The vials are clear Ph.Eur. type 1 glass with a coated chlorobutyl type I rubber stopper, aluminium 
overseal and flip-off cap.

Page 19/143 
 
 
 
A science and risk based approach, applying Quality by Design (QbD) and quality risk management 
according to ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10, was used for the development of the finished product. A Quality Target 
Product Profile (QTPP) was developed to define the desired quality characteristics of the finished product, 
i.e. a 10 mg/ml intravenous solution for infusion, containing a total of 200 mg of zanamivir, supporting 
dose titration for paediatric patients or those with renal impairment. The QTPP further defined the product 
as being suitable for direct infusion or for dilution in normal saline for IV infusion.  The product was to 
comprise materials with the required functional characteristics and to meet pharmacopoeial and other 
relevant quality standards, including sterility, over the proposed shelf-life.  The container closure was to 
provide adequate protection to the product and allow for terminal sterilisation.  The proposed shelf-life 
was to take into account the seasonal use of the product.   
The finished product CQAs were identified and formed the basis of the specification. They included: 
description, identity, content, drug related impurities, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, particulate 
contamination, pH, osmolality and extractable volume. An understanding of the impact of the attributes 
of the active substance, excipients, container closure system and in process materials, and parameters of 
the manufacturing process on the quality of the finished product was established.  
As indicated in the active substance section, the active substance zanamivir hydrate is a slightly 
hygroscopic powder, which is slightly soluble in water. Its solubility in saline at room temperature is 
approximately 18 mg/ml. The pH and osmolality of the solution are both within physiologically acceptable 
ranges and make the formulation suitable for its intended route of administration.  
Further investigation of pH solution stability showed that there was no trend in pH, active substance 
content or related impurities across the range of storage conditions, supporting the development of a 
non-buffered solution of zanamivir hydrate in the proposed sodium chloride concentration across the 
investigated concentration range. The impact of varying levels of sodium chloride and drug content on 
osmolality was investigated.  This, together withthe manufacturing process and to minimise risk of in-vivo 
precipitation, a solution concentration of 10 mg/ml that is not close to the active substance solubility limit 
was selected for the product.  
Whilst the active substance is a hydrate able to absorb/desorb water as environmental humidity changes, 
experimental work demonstrated that there is minimal risk to the CQA of drug content during dispensing 
in normal environmental operational conditions. 
Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients was confirmed by the stability studies performed 
during development and on the primary stability batches. These studies demonstrated the acceptable 
chemical and physical stability of the finished product  
The manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the formulation studies. The manufacturing 
process and control strategy for the product were defined based on risk assessment, applicant’s 
manufacturing experience and knowledge gained during product development.  
The manufacturing process is simple involving preparation of a bulk solution of zanamivir dissolved in 
water for injections with sodium chloride in order to ensure the correct osmolality. The bulk solution after 
double filtration is filled into sterilised vials. The filled vials are then autoclaved (Ph. Eur. conditions). 
Thermal stability of Zanamivir hydrate solution was investigated and it concluded that the solution is 
physical and chemically stable when exposed to/stored at elevated temperatures. In addition, terminal 
sterilisation in an autoclave under conditions exceeding those specified in the Ph. Eur had no negative 
impact on physical and chemical stability. 
Compatibility of the formulation with the filters was demonstrated.  
The formulation of the product intended for marketing is the same as the formulation used in Phase II and 
phase III clinical trials. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 20/143 
 
 
 
The control strategy for the different steps of the manufacturing process (e.g. bulk solution preparation, 
filling, terminal sterilization, primary packaging) have been described. 
The suitability of the glass vial was assessed Glass delamination was also investigated. No delamination 
particulates were observed in solution after  greater than 60 months ofstorag at the conditions tested. 
Moreover, levels of glass extracts in solution were lowor not detected, supporting a lack of 
container-formulation interaction.The rubber stoppers comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 type I closures. Rubber 
closures for containers for aqueous parenteral preparations, for powders and for freeze-dried powders 
and USP<87> Biological Reactivity Tests. Suitability of the selected stopper was demonstrated during 
product development underboth long term and accelerated storage conditions. Compliance with Ph.Eur. 
3.2.9 for fragmentation and penetrability was evaluated for both “as manufactured” and “aged” stoppers. 
Compatibility of the rubber stoppers was further verified through extractable and leachable testing. 
Risk assessments and experimental studies were used to establish the risk of patient exposure to 
leachables. Extractable studies were conducted to determine the risk associated with the stopper 
material. Vials from severalbatches of finished product were stored inverted -to maximise contact with 
the stopper- for up to 60 months at 30°C/75% RH (the long term storage condition) and for up to 12 
months at 40°C/75% RH. The results demonstrate that the volatile, semi-volatile and non-volatile 
leachables are at or below the reporting thresholddefined following the recommendations in ICH M7 for 
exposure periods less than or equal to one month. No leachables were detected at a level that would 
represent a risk to patients dosed with the product. Therefore, it is concluded that leachables present a 
negligible risk to patient safety. 
Input material used for the manufacture of the product (excipients and bulk drug substance) have 
microbial controls where applicable (i.e. for the WFI) and endotoxin controls (for the active substance, 
sodium chloride and WFI) in place. Bioburden of the bulk solution is determined before sterile filtration 
into vials, followed by terminal sterilisation. Microbial control of the formulation occurs at various stages 
of the process and is monitored throughout the shelf-life of the product. The finished product is a single 
use product and does not contain any antimicrobial preservatives. Product sterility is assured by controls 
on the excipients, active substance, primary packaging components, equipment and the processing 
environment, by product terminal sterilisation and through online and finished product testing. Stability 
studies include sterility testing to ensure integrity over the shelf life of the product. Microbial immersion 
has been used to demonstrate integrity of the container closure system after filling and terminal 
sterilisation. As shown in the next section, the finished product specification includes tests for bacterial 
endotoxins and sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1). 
Container closure integrity testing was used to demonstrate that the container closure system (glass 
vial/stopper/overseal) is robust through the processes used to combine the individual components. A 
microbiological challenge study was performed to demonstrate the integrity of the seal between the 
vial/stopper/overseal following subjection to autoclaving using the routine sterilisation cycle. At the end 
of the incubation period all challenged vials remained clear with no contamination, thus demonstrating 
maintenance of the sterility of the vial contents and integrity of the vial/stopper/overseal interface.  
The product may be administered by intravenous infusion as supplied i.e. at 10 mg/ml or diluted, to no 
less than 0.2 mg/ml, in 0.9% w/v sodium chloride. The compatibility of the formulation with intravenous 
solutions and medications other than 0.9 % w/v sodium chloride is not known. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process has been developed to reproducibly deliver the finished product critical quality 
attributes of description, identity, content, drug-related impurities, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, 
particulate contamination, pH, osmolality and extractable volume. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 21/143 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: primary pack preparation, bulk solution 
preparation, filtering and filling, terminal sterilisation and inspection.  
Holding times are proposed at different stages of manufacture. The proposed holding times have been 
justified on the basis that the active substance and finished product are chemically stable. Microbial 
validation results further support the proposed holding times. 
All critical process parameters (CPPs) together with in-process materials CQAs and in-process controls 
(IPC) have been identified. Process parameters and IPC are adequately set to control the process leading 
to consistent quality. 
No design space or proven acceptable Ranges (PAR) are proposed for the commercial product. The 
manufacturing process is based on target values and set points for process parameters supported by 
batch data from the commercial site of manufacture. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing 
process have been validated by a number of studies. Process validation was performed on three 
consecutive production scale batches which were manufactured at the commercial site at production 
scale, using the manufacturing process and controls as defined in in the dossier. The applicant proposed 
an additional validation exercise to complete an aspect related to inspection of the sterilised vials which 
will be completed prior to commercial supply of the drug product in accordance with the process validation 
scheme presented. This is acceptable. 
Overall, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  description  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC), 
extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The test for related substances has been omitted from the release specification. This is acceptable since 
all synthetic process impurities, which are not degradation products are controlled in the active substance 
specification in accordance with ICH Q6A, and the impurity profile of the finished product is that of the 
active substance, no degradation products are formed during the commercial manufacturing process.  
Osmolality is not tested on the finished product. This is considered acceptable based on the development 
work. The control strategy for osmolality for Dectova includes several elements and has been adequately 
justified.  A  risk  assessment  for  elemental  impurities  was  carried  out  in  line  with  ICH  Q3D,  which 
concluded that no tests for elemental impurities were required. 
The omission of a test for elemental impurities has also been justified. A risk assessment was conducted 
in accordance with option 2b of the ICH guideline Q3D guideline for elemental impurities to evaluate the 
potential for elemental impurities to be present in zanamivir hydrate. The risk assessment included the 
Class 1 elemental impurities (cadmium, lead, arsenic and mercury), the Class 2A elemental impurities 
(cobalt,  vanadium  and  nickel),  an  intentionally  added  Class  2B  elemental  impurity  from  the  active 
substance , the Class 3 elemental impurities recommended for consideration for a parenteral formulation 
(lithium, antimony, and copper), and intentionally added Class 3 elemental impurity from the container 
closure system. The risk assessment considered the contribution from the drug substance, manufacturing 
equipment,  excipients  and  the  container  closure  system.  No  elemental  impurities  were  identified  as 
having the potential to be present at a level of greater than 30% of the Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) 
limit for parenteral administration, using Option 2b defined in ICH Q3D. The risk assessment for Dectova 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 22/143 
 
 
 
is  appropriate  to  control  elemental  impurities  in  the  product  to  within  safe  levels  below  30  %  of  the 
proposed ICH Q3D PDE. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Adequate information has been provided for reference standards and materials. Batch analysis data has 
been presented for batches of the proposed batch size and the results show consistency. The container 
closure system complies with relevant pharmacopoeia criteria. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  6  production  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product manufactured with active 
substance made by route C stored for up to 60 months under 5 °C/Ambient and long term conditions (30 
ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  Supportive stability data on finished product batches manufactured by route D 
(48 months under long term and 6 months under accelerated conditions) were also submitted. The 
batches of Dectova are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing, a 26 ml Type I clear glass vial and sealed with a coated chlorobutyl 
stopper and secured with an aluminium overseal with a removable plastic flip-off cap. These batches were 
stored in the upright orientation and one of these batches was also stored in the inverted orientation. 
The long term storage condition of 30°C/75% RH was used. No significant changes were observed in 
description, zanamivir content, drug-related impurities content, particulate contamination, pH and 
sterility in any of the conditions tested. All results complied with the proposed commercial specification. 
The results demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of the product at all storage conditions. 
In addition, stability stress testing was performed under the following testing conditions: 50°C/ambient 
(1 and 3 months) upright (2 batches), freeze/thaw cycle (-20°C/30°C) upright (2 batches) and 
photostability (1 batch). The results demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of Dectova at all 
storage conditions. No significant changes were observed in description, zanamivir content, drug-related 
impurities content, particulate contamination and pH. All results complied with the proposed commercial 
specification. 
Forced degradation studies for Dectova exposing the product to high temperature and UV-Vis light 
exposure were conducted  to identify the main degradation products formed. Zanamivir hydrate in 
Dectova was stable under both conditions, None of the degradation products reported were observed to 
form above the identification threshold (>0.2%) specified in ICH Q3B in the primary stability studies. 
Mass balance was achieved for all stressed samples. The results demonstrate the stability indicating 
nature of the proposed HPLC method for zanamivir content and drug-related impurities. 
In-use stability of zanamivir hydrate solution for infusion following dilution in a representative infusion 
bag of 0.9% w/v sodium chloride, at concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml was also evaluated. 
These concentrations correspond to the lowest and highest doses expected to be administered. Samples 
were analysed after storage in a representative infusion bag under refrigeration (2ºC to 8ºC) and at room 
temperature 6 days. No significant changes were observed inthe tests performed.The results 
demonstrate the chemical stability of Dectova when stored for up to 6 days at 2ºC to 8ºC and room 
temperature.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 5 years without restrictions for storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Chemical in use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2ºC to 8ºC and room temperature. From 
a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use 
storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be 
longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 ºC, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance, zanamivir hydrate, is a known active substance with a Ph. Eur. monograph which 
has already been approved for the product Relenza inhalation powder from the same applicant. The 
information presented in this submission has been declared to be essentially the same as that registered 
for Relenza. Minor differences have been highlighted and are considered acceptable. 
The formulation is a simple solution containing the active substance (200mg zanamivir in 20ml/vial, 
giving a final concentration of 10mg/ml), a tonicity adjusting agent and a solvent. The product is a single 
use parenteral preparation for intravenous delivery sterilised by terminal sterilisation (autoclaving). The 
manufacturing process is simple involving preparation of a bulk solution of zanamivir dissolved in water 
for injections with sodium chloride in order to ensure the correct osmolality. The bulk solution after double 
filtration is filled into sterilised vials. The filled vials are then autoclaved (Ph Eur conditions).  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Zanamivir was evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies to characterise the virology of zanamivir 
and to determine its activity against influenza virus A and B virus replication, with respect to treatment 
and prophylaxis of influenza. Nonclinical virology studies were performed 20 years ago to support the 
inhaled zanamivir program to investigate the primary pharmacodynamic actions with respect to the 
treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. These studies determined the receptor specificity of zanamivir in 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 24/143 
 
 
 
 
vitro and its effects on isolated influenza A and B viruses. The effects of zanamivir were investigated in 
vivo using the ferret, as influenza infection of the respiratory tract results in symptoms that resemble 
closely the disease in humans. Studies that are more recent were carried out to investigate the antiviral 
activity of IV Zanamivir. The plasma elimination half-life of zanamivir in ferrets and mice is 40 and 11 
minutes, respectively, and is therefore too short to study IV Zanamivir (Stittelaar, 2008). The antiviral 
activity of IV Zanamivir was therefore studied in cynomolgus monkeys. No specific secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted. 
It is noted that in the CHMP Scientific Advice issued on 24 June 2010 (EMEA/H/SA/1586/1/2010/III) a 
question relating to the Toxico-Pharmacological development was raised by the applicant. It was asked if 
the supplied package of non-clinical studies was sufficient to support the full clinical development of IV 
zanamivir.  CHMP’s answer stated that the package was sufficient, although a definitive decision on the 
adequacy of the data would only be made on full assessment of the final non-clinical dossier. It also stated 
that the following additional points might be taken into consideration: 
“Regarding safety pharmacology studies, consideration should be given to the low number of animals 
which  have  been  used  to  identify  undesirable  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  zanamivir  that  may  be 
relevant for human safety. Therefore, this may be sufficient for the assessment of safety pharmacology of 
IV  zanamivir  as  long  as  the  important  functional  endpoints  as  overt  central  and  peripheral  effects, 
cardiovascular and respiratory effects and pharmacodynamic drug interactions will have been assessed in 
repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  following  IV  administration.  This  issue  is  considered  important  to  be 
clarified in the dossier.”   
The important functional endpoints outlined in the CHMP advice have not been assessed in repeat dose 
toxicity studies. The applicant´s justification that the absence of overtly adverse findings in both safety 
pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicology studies, together with an absence of findings in clinical use 
gives reassurance of the safety of zanamivir in clinical usage, is acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
Inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) was examined in several studies with IC50 values varying 
from 0.64 nM and 7.9 nM against the NAs of a range of laboratory adapted and clinical isolates of influenza 
A and influenza B viruses. It was shown activity against influenza A/H1N1pdm09 viruses, with and 
without the H275Y substitution, the most common oseltamivir NA substitution (IC50, 0.29 and 0.37 nM 
respectively). 
Zanamivir did inhibit influenza virus NAs derived from nonhuman mammals and birds (N1 to N9) with 
IC50 values between 2.2 and 30.1 nM. Different clades of influenza A/H5N1 viruses are sensitive to 
zanamivir with IC50 values in the range of 1.21 to 1.96 nM as are A/H5N1 viruses containing the H275Y 
substitution (the most common substitution giving resistance to Oseltamivir) (IC50 2.4-2.5 nM). 
Zanamivir is also active against the H7N9 avian influenza virus (IC50 0.74 nM) that has infected humans 
since 2013 (Zhang, 2014). Oseltamivir and peramivir treatment in patients infected with H7N9 readily 
selects a variant with the NA R292K substitution that is resistant to oseltamivir (IC50 >1000 nM) and has 
reduced susceptibility to peramivir (IC50 96.5 nM) and zanamivir (IC50 12.4 nM). 
In mammalian cells in vitro, it was shown activity against a range of laboratory adapted and clinical 
isolates of influenza A and influenza B viruses. This included all 9 avian NA subtypes. IC50 range was 0.005 
to 16 µM; mean 1.5 µM. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 25/143 
 
 
 
Zanamivir did not have any antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, 
cytomegalovirus, human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza virus in vitro, or activity against 
Plasmodium falciparum, at all concentrations tested up to the maximum of 1000 µM. 
Activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in inhibition of HIV-1 syncytia formation and 
inhibition of p24 antigen synthesis assays with IC50 = 15 to 22 µM) was 10 to 10,000-fold less than that 
seen with influenza A and B viruses. It was 100 to 200 times less than the antiviral activity of 
azidothymidine against HIV-1. Zanamivir activity is not impaired by substances that are frequently used 
to treat influenza symptoms, for example ibuprofen, oxymetazoline and co-amoxiclav. 
Zanamivir had low cytotoxicity compared to comparators (e.g. ribavirin) and CCIC50 values were > 1mM 
for each of the 4 cell lines that were tested MRC-5, PANC-1, 161-BR and MDCK. No uptake into MOCK cells 
in vitro was found, indicating that the antiviral activity of zanamivir was extracellular. 
In vivo 
Zanamivir was shown to be effective when administered either therapeutically or prophylactically in both 
the mouse and ferret models of influenza. 
Zanamivir did not protect chickens (administrated intratracheally) against systemic infection with highly 
pathogenic avian influenza viruses introduced into the trachea. This is because the drug acts locally in the 
respiratory tract and has limited effect against a systemic infection. 
In a macaque challenge study, it was demonstrated that at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, there were 
reductions in viral load in monkeys (> 10 times in 50 % of the animals). The sample sizes were small and 
there was considerable variability of viral load and gross pathology within groups. 
Drug resistance 
Resistance to zanamivir has been investigated in vitro, in vivo, and in humans following treatment and in 
surveillance studies in viruses isolated from untreated humans. Some resistance in the presence of 
zanamivir have been identified in vitro and in vivo (ferrets) but the clinical importance of the resistant 
genotypes is not established. More details on drug resistance are presented in the clinical part of the 
assessment report. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Specific secondary pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted with zanamivir.  Zanamivir was a 
weak inhibitor of human lysosomal NA and NA from other organisms. Zanamivir was shown to be a weak 
inhibitor of the human lysosomal sialidase with IC50 values in the range 0.93-1.0 mM (Report 92/083). It 
was shown that zanamivir inhibits the sialidase of influenza A and B viruses more than that of 
parainfluenza virus, three bacteria and sheep liver. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies have been performed in rats, dogs and cats to evaluate the potential effects 
of zanamivir on the central and peripheral nervous systems, cardiovascular and respiratory systems as 
well as potential adverse pharmacodynamic effects in the mouse. Increased arterial blood pressure at IV 
doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg was observed in cats, but was not reproduced in dogs or in clinical data and the 
clinical relevance is likely to be low. 
No in vitro study was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular system. The lack of in vitro studies can be 
accepted based on the in vivo study results and human ECG data are available from two studies, including 
a QT study and no effect of zanamivir was observed when given IV up to 1200 mg. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 26/143 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular function was examined in cats, dogs, and no effect on blood pressure, heart rate, ECG or 
PT or QT intervals were discovered in dogs that were given zanamivir as single IV doses up to 30 mg/kg 
or by IV infusion at 90 mg/kg/day. In a five week study with dogs given zanamivir IV there were no 
treatment effects related to the cardiovascular system 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In a study in mice effects on pentobarbitone-induced loss of righting reflex (sleep time), it was observed 
an increase in sleeping time at 100 mg/kg administration of zanamivir. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Method of analysis 
The methods and limits of quantification were adequate with regard to specificity and sensitivity to 
support the kinetic analyses of zanamivir. 
Absorption 
Absorption from the lungs after inhalation (IH) administration to mouse, rat and dog had a Tmax value in 
general up to 1.5 hours after the end of the IH period or sooner. Poor absorption was seen after oral 
administration based on low oral bioavailability in rats and dogs, probably due to low permeability. 
Following IV administration, zanamivir was rapidly cleared from the plasma with half-lives ranging from 
0.26 hours (rats) to 2.7 hours (monkeys). Renal clearance seen in rats and dogs were 7.8 and 2.8 
mL/min/kg respectively and was 90 % of the plasma clearance. This is expected since zanamivir is 
primarily excreted via urine. In general, high clearance and low volume of distribution was observed. 
Repeat IV studies in rats (non-pregnant and pregnant) and dogs for up to 5 weeks, showed a 
dose-proportional increase in exposure to Zanamivir. No notable gender difference in exposure was 
observed in rats or dogs. Systemic exposure was observed in female rabbits after IV administration of 
zanamivir. 
Zanamivir was administrated by IH in rats up to 26 weeks of duration and up to 52 weeks in dogs, with no 
noteworthy change of parameters by repeated administration. A dose proportional increase in exposure 
was observed, with little difference between the sexes. The same pattern was observed after IH dosing of 
zanamivir in the carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats (104 weeks) with no difference in exposure 
between males and females or due to repeated administration and systemic exposure increasing with 
increasing dose. Similar systemic exposure to zanamivir was demonstrated in pregnant and 
non-pregnant rabbits. Systemic exposure was demonstrated following subcutaneous (SC) administration 
of zanamivir. 
Distribution 
In vitro 
It was observed that zanamivir was bound to plasma proteins and to erythrocytes from rats and dogs and 
rats to a low degree, less than 10 % (quite similar to the situation in man). Drug interactions due to 
protein displacement are therefore not likely to occur in humans. It was shown that zanamivir is not a 
substrate for human P-gp, and that it has a low passive permeability (measured in MDCKII-MDR1 cells in 
the presence of 2 µM GF120918A (a potent inhibitor of P-gp). 
It was also shown that zanamivir did not inhibit renal transporter-mediated uptake, since less than 50 % 
inhibition of uptake was measured via all tested transporters (hOAT1, hOAT2, hOAT3, hOAT4, hOCT1, 
hOCT2, hOCT2-A, hOCT3 and hURAT1). 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 27/143 
 
 
 
In vivo 
In a study in rats, zanamivir was given IV and it was shown distribution, but not to CNS. It was shown that 
with the exception of bladder, kidney, and lung, the tissue concentrations were generally below those 
present in blood. The highest concentrations were seen in the bladder and kidney, with zanamivir rapidly 
clearing from most tissues, consistent with urine being the most important way of excretion. 
Zanamivir had a low volume of distribution in rats, dogs and monkeys with values from 0.2 to 0.3 L/kg, 
less than the intercellular fluid volume, indicating limited distribution into tissues. Low levels were still 
present 168 h post-dosing in the gastrointestinal tract and in the eyes of pigmented rats. However, no 
increased binding of drug-related material was found in any other melanin containing tissues. 
Low levels of zanamivir were found to cross the placenta (0.04% and 0.02% of the administered dose 
reaching the foetus 0.5 hours post dose on Days 12 and 19 in rats) following IV administration to rats and 
rabbits of 10 mg/kg. In lactating rats, the drug concentration was higher in the milk than in the plasma, 
indicating some exposure of drug-related material in the milk to suckling pups. Zanamivir was detected in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) with a BAL/plasma ratio of up to 0.161 at 1 hour following dosing in a 
single IV study in rats given 10 mg/kg. In male cynomolgus monkeys, it was confirmed that zanamivir 
distributed into the pulmonary compartment at concentrations greater than the IC50 for H5N1 throughout 
the 12-hour dosing interval. 
Metabolism 
There was no metabolism observed in vitro after incubation with rat lung microsomes or rat lung 
supernatant preparations. Zanamivir was not metabolised in rats, dogs, pregnant rats or pregnant rabbits 
after IV administration of 10 mg/kg 14C-Zanamivir. 
Excretion 
Excretion of zanamivir was investigated in rats, pregnant rabbits and dogs. Almost all of the radiolabelled 
zanamivir was excreted in urine, mostly in the first 24 hours. 91-100 % was excreted in urine in rats and 
between 80-95 % was excreted in urine in dogs. Faecal excretion was low and was less than 3% in male 
rats and 0.2-0.8 % in male dogs. Excretion was also primarily in urine in female rats (84.1 % of 
administered dose), pregnant rats (95 % of the administered dose) and pregnant rabbits (64 % following 
a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg with total recovery of 83 %). 
Drug interactions 
Zanamivir is not metabolised and there is low risk of drug interactions due to inhibition or induction of 
drug metabolising enzymes by co-administered drugs. In an in vitro study, no changes to the uptake of 
glucose, urate or Gly-Sar were observed following incubation with zanamivir indicating no interactions of 
zanamivir in the reabsorption process in renal tubules. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose acute toxicity studies were performed in the mouse or rat by the intravenous and oral routes 
of administration, and additionally in the rat by inhalation. Studies showed a low potential for acute 
toxicity of zanamivir by the intravenous, inhalation or oral route. Doses used were limited by the solubility 
in sodium chloride. Target organ toxicity was not seen following IV administration of zanamivir of 90 
mg/kg to mice, rats or following oral doses in mice or rats. In a study with mice following intravenous 
administration of 90 mg/kg zanamivir, one mouse was killed for humane reasons due to low posture and 
loss of co-ordination, indicating CNS effects. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 28/143 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and dogs using IV, IH and or intranasal (IN) route of 
administration.  
IV studies were performed in rats and dogs up to 5 weeks duration. In rats, the continuous (24-hour) IV 
infusion of Zanamivir for 48 hours at a dose level of 13824 mg/kg/day produced renal damage in one rat. 
The continuous IV infusion in rats of zanamivir at dose concentration up to 6912 mg/kg/day for 14 
consecutive days was associated with vacuolar degeneration in the kidneys and increased prominence of 
the sinusoidal macrophages in the lymph nodes. In another 14 –days IV infusion study in rats, reduced 
body weight gain was observed in females at 1728 mg/kg/day and a dose-related (reversible) vacuolation 
of the proximal convoluted tubules in the renal cortex in males and females at 864 and 1728 mg/kg/day, 
which was considered to represent hydropic change in the cortical tubule cells. No toxic treatment related 
effects were seen in the 5-week IV administration study in rats. 
In a 5-week inhalation study in rats, reduced neutrophil counts were observed in males and a temporary 
disturbance of urinary output and urinary electrolyte concentration was observed in female rats. 
In rats and dogs, the AUC data from IV pivotal studies resulted in margins of 0.75 to 16 for zanamivir 
(observed at NOAEL). 
Genotoxicity 
Overall, zanamivir was not considered genotoxic when tested in a battery of in vitro an in vivo tests. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenic studies were only performed in mice and rats by inhalation route and revealed no 
tumorigenic findings related to long-term inhalation carcinogenicity studies. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Zanamivir did not affect fertility or reproductive performance in male or female rats and rabbits. Some 
behavioural effects were observed in F1 generation males in a fertility study with IV doses of zanamivir up 
to, 90 mg/kg/day. Physical and functional developmental effects consisting of a reduction of mean 
performance times in the rotarod test, a slight reduction in forelimb grip strength and a slight reduction 
in the level of arousal were reported in males derived from the group given 90 mg/kg/day in the fertility 
study. A possible effect was apparent also at 9 mg/kg/day.  
Following administration of 80 mg/kg TID SC in rats, there were slightly higher incidences of some minor 
alterations and variants that indicated a delay in development. 
In an organogenesis study in rabbits, the incidence of malformations (post implantation loss) seemed 
elevated in treated groups. 
Subcutaneous (SC) repeat administration tests were performed in young rats and via inhalation in 
juvenile dogs. There were no adverse treatment-related effects on juvenile rats or dogs related to 
zanamivir administration subcutaneously or via inhalation. 
Local Tolerance  
No dermal irritancy, ocular irritancy or skin sensitisation potential was observed in the performed studies 
investigating local tolerance. 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 29/143 
 
 
 
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities 
The impurities was considered as safe and qualified up to the set specifications.  
Antigenicity 
No antigenic potential was revealed when zanamivir given by intraperitoneal or SC administration 
followed by IV challenge in an antigenicity study in guinea pigs. 
Immunotoxicity 
The immunotoxic potential of zanamivir in rats was investigated following daily SC administration at 
doses of 9 and 80 mg/kg/day for 28 days and no adverse effects indicating immunotoxicity was detected. 
Phototoxicity 
Zanamivir does not absorb light in the 290 to 700 nm wavelength range therefore, there is no concern 
with regard to photosafety in patients and photosafety testing was not warranted, according to ICH S10. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The zanamivir PECSW refined value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, zanamivir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
A Phase II Tier A assessment is not required for Dectova. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Zanamivir was shown as a weak inhibitor of the human lysosomal neuraminidase and the neuraminidase 
from several other organisms. It is therefore unlikely to affect other pharmacologically relevant targets 
and it can be accepted that no specific secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with 
zanamivir. 
Increased arterial blood pressure (lasting less than 4 minutes) at IV doses of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg was 
observed in a study on cardiovascular and respiratory function in cats. This was however not reproduced 
in dogs (single IV dose of up to 30 mg/kg or in the repeat dose toxicity IV studies), and the clinical 
relevance of the finding in cats is likely to be low. 
A tendency for prolonging of the sleeping time was observed in mice administered Zanamivir of 100 
mg/kg. However, studies of effects of various P-450 isoenzymes (below) showed that there were no 
effects of Zanamivir on metabolic pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in human liver 
microsomes in vitro or in expression levels of hepatic CYP enzymes in vivo in the rat. It is not expected 
that zanamivir will affect the hepatic clearance of compounds metabolized by CYP enzymes, which may be 
administered concomitantly. 
In Ames test, statistically significant increases in revertant colonies were observed in some strains with or 
without S9, but the results were small and not reproducible. In a plate incorporation assay, positive 
results were obtained with some strains in the absence or presence of S9 that were not dose-related or 
reproducible. In the mouse lymphoma assay, there were also positive results that were not reproducible 
or performed according to current guidelines. In conclusion, zanamivir was not considered genotoxic. 
It  is  noted  that  in  study,  the  route  of  administration  is  oral.  The  guideline  for  OECD474  (Mammalian 
Erythrocyte  Micronucleus  Test)  states  the  anticipated  route  of  human  exposure  should  be  considered 
when designing an assay. The impurity is controlled to less than 0.01% in the zanamivir drug substance 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 30/143 
 
 
 
 
and  was  studied  in  a  mammalian  erythrocyte  micronucleus  test  for  worker-safety  reasons  and  not 
conducted specifically in support of IV zanamivir. As such, the applicant’s choice of route of administration 
is considered justified for this study. 
It can be accepted that no carcinogenicity studies were performed with the IV route of administration. 
Based  on  the  absence  of  neoplastic  findings  in  the  inhalation  carcinogenicity  studies,  indication  of 
carcinogenic  potential  in  the  IV  repeat-dose  studies  and  no  positive  genotoxicity  results,  zanamivir  is 
considered not to pose a carcinogenic risk in the proposed IV short-term clinical use.  
In a fertility and reproductive study with IV doses given to rats (male and female) up to 90 mg/kg/day, 
behavioural effects were observed in F1 generation males. This was for example a reduction in mean 
performance times in the accelerating rotarod test or reduction in forelimb grip strength was seen. These 
effects were however not observed in other studies (including the pre and post-natal study) with same 
dose levels, and the biological relevance appears low. 
In an organogenesis study in rabbits, the incidence of malformations (post-implantation loss) seemed 
elevated in treated groups. However, the majority of these were multiple, confined to a few litters and 
minor background anomalies were not increased consistent with a spontaneous pattern. Overall the 
distribution as well as pattern of anomalies and malformations among foetuses in different groups was 
indicative of a spontaneous aetiology 
Higher incidence of some minor variants and alterations was observed after administration of zanamivir 
SC, at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats. Incomplete ossification of skull bones and sacral 
vertebral arches, slightly kinked ribs, slightly dilated ureter and elongated innominate artery, was 
observed, but without statistical significance. Since the findings often occur spontaneously in the Wistar 
Han rat they are considered to be either associated with a delay in skeletal development or minor 
changes. 
Zanamivir is not considered teratogen in animals, but was shown to cross the placenta. Zanamivir was 
secreted in low amounts in milk in rats. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, or toxicity to reproduction 
and development, with the exception of a rat embryofoetal development study (subcutaneous 
administration). In the rat embryofoetal study, there was an increase in the incidence rates of a variety 
of minor skeletal and visceral alterations, most of which remained within the background rates of the 
historical occurrence in the strain studied. 
The CHMP considers that from a non-clinical point of view, no issues remain which would preclude 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Zanamivir hydrate sterile 10 mg/ml solution for infusion in 0.9% NaCl (IV zanamivir) is an aqueous 
formulation that was developed originally to support the nonclinical safety assessment and Phase I clinical 
studies of Relenza (zanamivir) inhalation powder. Five legacy studies that included the aqueous 
formulation are now used to support the current MAA in addition to several more recent Phase I studies 
specifically conducted to support development of IV zanamivir. The clinical pharmacology programme for 
IV zanamivir with PK data includes eleven Phase I studies, one BE study, and two clinical studies in adults 
and children hospitalised with influenza. Population PK analyses of zanamivir following IV administration 
were performed in combined populations of healthy subjects, and paediatric and adults with influenza, 
with various degrees of renal impairment enrolled across eight Phase I to III studies. In addition, in vitro 
studies using human biomaterial to investigate DDI potential and extent of plasma protein binding have 
been presented. The proposed posology is 600 mg BID in adults ≥ 18 years and weight-based dose in 
children below 18 years.

popPK: Population PK and PKPD model analysis have been performed to inform the clinical 
pharmacological development of zanamivir. The results generated from the popPK analyses were used to 
characterise the zanamivir disposition, while simulations and the PKPD model were used to support 
dosing recommendations in adults and children 6 months to <18 years. Simulations of 300 mg and 600

mg BID and QD regimens for zanamivir IV, analysed by age and renal function, have been presented as 
well as estimates of percentages with steady state concentrations throughout the dosing interval above 
the IC50 and IC90 values (see PD section). The model was based on data from studies with extensive 
(healthy subjects) and sparse (influenza patients) PK sampling covering a range of doses (100-1200 mg) 
given as IV infusion over 30 minutes. The data were best described by a simple two-compartment IV 
infusion model. The inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and volume of distribution (V1, V2) were 
positively correlated with body weight. 
Absorption  
The current product is an aqueous formulation intended for infusion only. Mean oral bioavailability was 
2% (range 1-4%), with or without glucose. A BE study was conducted to support the use of blinded, 
over-encapsulated Tamiflu capsules as the active comparator in the pivotal study NAI114373. 
Distribution 
Binding of 14C-zanamivir to human plasma proteins and red blood cells was found to be ≤10% over the 
investigated concentration range (0.05, 0.5, 10 µg/ml). Following IV administration, zanamivir 
concentrations in serum decline in a bi-exponential manner, with a rapid initial distribution phase. In the 
popPK analysis the Vd ss was estimated to be 18.8 L for a typical adult subjects, and was not affected by 
infection with influenza virus. Following IV 600 mg BID zanamivir, the median trough concentrations in 
epithelial lining fluid were 47-66% compared to orally inhaled zanamivir 10 mg BID (the approved 
posology for Relenza) in healthy individuals. Urea-corrected drug concentrations of zanamivir could be 
detected in throat gargles and/or nasal washes at 1h following IV administration of 50 mg to 600 mg 
single doses zanamivir, and at 4h and 12h following IV administration of 600 mg BID zanamivir. A high 
inter-subject variability was observed. 
Elimination 
No mass balance study has been conducted. No metabolites have been reported in nonclinical studies, 
and predominantly renal elimination of unchanged drug was observed in the investigated species. 
Following IV administration, zanamivir concentrations in human serum decline in a bi-exponential 
manner, with a half-life of approximately 2-3 hours. The individual studies as well as the popPK analysis 
indicate that zanamivir undergoes extensive renal elimination. More than 90% of zanamivir is excreted 
unchanged in urine. Total and renal clearance correlated well with CrCL. Mean clearance (CL) following IV 
administration ranged between 90 to 111 ml/min across doses of 1-16 mg, and renal clearance (CL R) of 
unchanged drug ranged between 93 to 130 ml/min across doses of 50-600 mg. In a popPK analysis the 
typical value of zanamivir clearance (CL) was estimated to be 113.67 ml/min in healthy adults. 
The potential consequences of possible genetic polymorphism have not been discussed. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Zanamivir serum concentrations (Cmax and AUC) appear to be dose-proportional over the investigated 
dose range (single dose 1 to 1200 mg) in healthy individuals. Cmax ranged from 2263 (50 mg) to 43371 
ng/ml (600 mg). Cmax after initial dose (300 or 600 mg) was approximately proportional to dose 
regardless of renal function. Negligible accumulation (accumulation ratio 1.05) based on AUCτ was 
observed following zanamivir 600 mg IV BID for five days.

EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 34/143 
 
 
 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Across doses, inter-individual variability in serum concentrations in NAI106784 was low. In 
NAI117104 the inter-subject CV% for all the PK parameter estimates ranged from 13.9% to 24.5% on 
Day 1 (300 mg single dose) and 8.7% to 15.6% on Day 8 (end of 300 mg q12h IV dosing). After 600 mg 
q12h the inter-subject CV% for all the PK parameter estimates ranged from 17.0% to 25.4% on Day 1 
and 7.0% to 23.5% on Day 8. High inter-subject variability in zanamivir PK exposure were observed 
within the target population following repeated administration of zanamivir 600 mg IV BID. In the popPK 
analysis inter-individual variability on CL in patients (69.4%) was 3 times higher than in healthy subjects 
with similar renal function. IIV on V1 was 34.8%. Intra-subject variability has not been reported. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The proposed posology includes a 600 mg loading dose (irrespective of renal function), followed by 
reductions in maintenance dose when CrCL is < 80 ml/min with prolonged administration of the second 
dose. Zanamivir is expected to be removed by CRRT, and the zanamivir dose is selected based on CRRT 
clearance (CL CRRT in ml/min) in individual CRRT patients in place of calculated CLCr. For patients on 
intermittent haemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis, the zanamivir dose as determined by CLCr is given after 
completion of the dialysis session. The proposed dose recommendations were used in clinical studies. 
Zanamivir PK parameters in target patients following IV administration by 30 minute infusion of doses 
adjusted for age, weight and renal function were overall similar with those observed in Phase I studies, 
however variability was higher. After an initial dose of 600 mg zanamivir in adults, AUC increased 1.4- to 
11-fold with decreasing CLCr. Comparable Cmax was observed in individuals irrespective of renal function 
as expected considering the initial 600 mg loading dose and the 30 minutes infusion period. After 
repeated doses of zanamivir (600 mg BID dosing schedule adjusted for renal function) in adults, Cmax 
decreased with decreasing renal function, but AUC was comparable with exception of the <30 ml/min 
cohorts: lower AUC in subjects with CLCr <15 mL/min and two-fold higher AUC in patients with CLCr 15 
to <30 ml/min. 
Mean exposures (AUC) in patients 6 months to <18 years with normal renal function ranged from 64.5 to 
107 h*µg/ml as compared to adult exposure of 82.9 to 90.3 µg*h/ml following 600 mg single and BID 
dosing. Few patients were included within each age and renal cohort, only seven children in this study 
(NAI113678) were aged <1 year. 
In the popPK analysis CL in hospitalised patients was found to be 24% lower (5.16 L/hr [85.9 ml/min]) as 
compared with healthy subjects (6.82 L/hr [113.67 ml/min] for a typical subject of 70 kg), and was 
further reduced by ~26-54%, ~54-72% and ~72-86% in patients with mild (CrCl 50-79 ml/min), 
moderate (30-49 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (15-29 ml/min), respectively and by > 86% for 
ESRD (<15 ml/min). Half-life increased to 3.88 hours, 5.79 hours and 12.8 hours in mild, moderate and 
severe renal impaired subjects respectively, compared to 2.44 hours in subjects with normal renal 
function). 
Special populations 
In a dedicated renal impairment study, zanamivir AUC and t1/2 increased and CL and CLr decreased with 
decreasing renal function, while as expected after a single dose Cmax, tmax, and Vz appeared to be similar 
across the renal function groups. Zanamivir AUC (0-∞) was approximately 56%, 153%, and 427% 
greater in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with 
subjects in the normal renal function group. Corresponding increases in t1/2 were observed. Zanamivir 
total and renal clearance were both highly correlated with CLCr (r2> 0.87, p<0.0001).

The effect of liver impairment on zanamivir PK has not been assessed.  However, zanamivir is not 
metabolised, therefore no effect of hepatic impairment is expected. 
No dedicated PK study investigating the effect of gender on zanamivir PK has been performed. The popPK 
analysis did not support a co-variate effect on the PK, and  justifies the omission for a dedicated PK study 
in this regard.  This is accepted by CHMP. 
PK in healthy Caucasians compared to PK in Thai, Chinese and Japanese healthy subjects appears to be 
overall similar. Exposures (AUC and Cmax) following 600 mg BID dosing in healthy East-Asians were up to 
35% higher as compared to exposures in healthy Caucasians. In a popPK analysis race was not shown to 
impact on zanamivir CL, although there was a trend for a slightly higher CL in the Asian population. 
No dedicated PK study investigating the effect of weight on zanamivir PK has been performed. Since the 
Vdss is consistent with extracellular volume no effect of obesity is expected. Weight was not included as 
a covariate in the popPK analysis. 
No dedicated PK study in elderly has been performed. Available PK data in elderly patients were obtained 
in the supportive and pivotal studies NAI113678 and NAI114373. In the popPK analysis, age was 
found to be correlated with CLCr but had no significant effect on zanamivir pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro, zanamivir was shown to have no inhibitory effect on the metabolism of the probe substrates for 
CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 by human liver microsomes over the investigated 
concentration range 0.1 to 500 µM (0.033 µg/ml to 166 µg/ml). No direct or metabolism dependent 
inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4 and no induction of CYP1A2 or 2B6 was observed 
at concentrations up to 10 mM zanamivir (i.e. >50-fold free Cmax following repeat dosing of 600 mg IV 
BID zanamivir). Weak induction of CYP3A4 was observed with concentrations up to 2 mM zanamivir, and 
a more marked induction of CYP3A4 mRNA, of up to 7 fold (mean ~20% positive control) was observed 
with 10 mM zanamivir. 
Zanamivir 10 µM (3.32 µg/ml) was not a substrate for Pgp and had low passive membrane permeability. 
Zanamivir 1 mM (332.3µg/ml) produced less than 50% inhibition of uptake via all the tested transporters, 
hOAT1, hOAT2, hOAT3, hOAT4, hOCT1, hOCT2, hOCT2-A, hOCT3 and hURAT1. No inhibition of the 
investigated transporters (BCRP, MDR1/Pgp, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
OCT2) was observed at zanamivir concentrations 0.01µM to 10 mM. 
In an in vivo DDI study investigating the impact of zanamivir on oseltamivir PK, Cmax and AUC of 
oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate were not significantly different when oseltamivir was given 
separately or together with zanamivir. Zanamivir CL was shown to be similar, however no formal BE 
testing of zanamivir PK with or without oseltamivir was performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Zanamivir is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, an enzyme that releases viral particles from 
the plasma membrane of infected cells and promotes virus spread in the respiratory tract.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Challenge study NAIA 1010:  Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Zanamivir administered 
intravenously as repeated doses to healthy male volunteers inoculated with Influenza A 
Texas/91 (H1N1) Virus 
Study Design 
This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre parallel study in 16 healthy male serologically 
susceptible (HI antibody titer of ≤1:8 to the challenge strain) subjects to evaluate the effect of zanamivir 
administered intravenously in preventing illness and reducing viral replication following inoculation with 
influenza A virus. Subjects were dosed as inpatients twice daily for 5 days starting at 4 hours prior to the 
scheduled viral inoculation. 
Sixteen healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 35 years were enrolled in the study. Eight subjects in the 
placebo group and seven in the zanamivir group were evaluable in the efficacy analyses. One subject in 
the zanamivir group shed virus different from the inoculated influenza A/Texas/91 and was excluded from 
the evaluable population for efficacy assessment. The age distribution was similar among treatments, 
with a median age of 24 years in both treatment groups. The majority were Caucasian (88% in each 
treatment arm). 
Treatment Administration 
Sixteen serologically susceptible male subjects were randomized to receive zanamivir 600mg or placebo 
intravenously over 30 minutes at approximately 8 am and 8 pm for a total of 10 doses in a blind fashion 
starting 4 hours prior to viral inoculation on Day 0. 
Influenza A/Texas/91 (H1N1) virus suspension (105TCID50) was administered intranasally to each subject 
on Day 0 at approximately noon. The inoculum was administered intranasally (0.25ml per nostril) with 
the subject in a supine position and the neck hyperextended. Back titration indicated the strength of 
Influenza A/Texas/91 (H1N1) virus administered to each individual was approximately 105.7TCID50 
Efficacy Results 
A subject was considered infected if there was a positive culture for the inoculated virus in nasal washings, 
and/or at least four-fold increase in convalescent HI antibody compared with pre-inoculation. 
Convalescent antibody titres for all subjects were collected 3 to 4 weeks post-inoculation. 
All subjects in the placebo group shed virus and all seroconverted.  No subjects in the zanamivir group 
shed virus; one subject in the zanamivir group had seroconversion without shedding virus. 
Influenza-like symptoms were obtained by self-administered questionnaire. Symptoms were scored as 
follows: 0=none; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe. All subjects in the placebo group and 86% of subjects 
in the zanamivir group had at least one symptom after inoculation. 
There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of upper respiratory infection, myalgia, and 
fatigue, and statistically significant differences between groups in overall means (0.01 versus 0.37 in 
placebo) of daily upper respiratory infection scores (where severity of each symptom was recorded on a 
scale from 0 to 3, where 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). There were also statistically 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 37/143 
 
 
 
 
 
significant differences between groups in proportions of subjects (29% versus 100% in placebo) with 
upper respiratory infection symptoms after viral inoculation. 
There was a statistically significant difference in the number of subjects with fever (1 subject in the 
zanamivir group compared with 7 subjects in placebo). The one subject in the zanamivir group with fever 
had a slight temperature (37.0°C) for half a day on Day 2. 
Mean nasal discharge weight was lower in the zanamivir group compared with the placebo group from 
Day 0 to 7. 
There were no statistical or clinical differences between treatment groups in IL-6 or TNF-α plasma levels. 
Efficacy Conclusions 
The results from NAIA1010 indicate that IV zanamivir had significant prophylactic effect against an 
experimental challenge with influenza A. This was demonstrated by a low infection rate (14% vs. 100% 
positive serology in the placebo group), isolation by viral culture of virus (0% vs. 100% in the placebo 
group), as well as reductions in fever (14% vs. 88% in the placebo group), upper respiratory tract illness 
(0% versus 100% in the placebo group) and total symptom scores (1 vs. 44 median score in the placebo 
group). 
Virology 
Virology data from the clinical studies NAI114373 and NAI113678 are presented in the efficacy section 
for each of the studies. 
Zanamivir and drug resistance 
Resistance to oseltamivir is well documented, the most common NA resistance substitution being H275Y. 
The structure of zanamivir is similar to the natural substrate which is likely to contribute to the high 
barrier to resistance; the majority of oseltamivir resistant viruses remain sensitive to zanamivir. 
NA susceptibility and development of drug resistance in influenza viruses continues to be monitored 
through a number of surveillance initiatives and ad hoc studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
collates data from WHO National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres, through the Global 
Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Data from Europe (EU/EEA) is collated by the 
coordinators of Community Network of Reference Laboratories for Human Influenza in Europe (CNRL) 
under the aegis of the ECDC. 
Two basic mechanisms of resistance have been described: one involves changes in the HA and the other 
changes in the NA. Amino acid changes at or near the receptor binding site decrease the affinity of the HA 
for sialic acid. These variants have a decreased dependence on NA for release from infected cells in vitro. 
The role of the HA in resistance to zanamivir and other NA inhibitors in vivo is not fully understood. The 
second mechanism of resistance involves amino acid substitutions in the NA that confer reduced affinity 
of the NA binding site for zanamivir and result in reduced inhibition of NA enzyme activity by the drug. 
The most frequent variants selected in vitro have amino acid changes at position 119 from glutamic acid 
to glycine (E119G) or aspartic acid (E119D) or alanine (E119A). Using an H4N2 turkey virus, another 
resistant virus with an arginine to lysine substitution at residue 292 (R292K), which appeared after 
several passages in increasing concentrations of zanamivir, has been reported. Both the Glu119 mutant 
and the Lys292 mutants have reduced NA activity. Passage of influenza A (H1N1) and A/H5N1 in the 
Dectova assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 38/143 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presence of zanamivir produced resistant viruses with a large portion of the NA deleted between amino 
acids 92 and 362 and a substitution at D198N respectively. In vitro passage of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 
virus in the presence of zanamivir selected a virus with N146S NA and G158E HA substitutions that only 
reduced drug susceptibility by 2-fold in enzyme assays. The clinical importance of the resistant genotypes 
which have been selected from in vitro experiments has not been established. 
The NA substitution Q136K has been detected during passage of H1N1 viruses in zanamivir. Resistant 
viruses harbouring the Q136L NA substitution have been selected in ferrets infected with influenza 
A/H5N1 following treatment with zanamivir and confer high level resistance to zanamivir. The Q136K 
substitution has previously only been seen in cultured virus and the selection of Q136L in ferrets 
demonstrates that substitutions at this position in the NA can persist and may be transmittable. The 
Q136K/L substitution has only been isolated from a small number of immunocompromised patients 
treated with zanamivir has reduced replicative capacity and therefore is presently not thought to be a 
public health threat. 
Study NAI114373 
The applicant has provided data on two H3N2 viruses recovered from 2 subjects treated with 300 mg BID 
group with N294N/S and T325I substitutions. To ascertain the effect of neuraminidase (NA) substitutions 
N294S and T325I on susceptibility to zanamivir a reverse genetics project was carried out by Viroclinics 
Biosciences. The N294S and T325I substitutions were created in the genetic background of the influenza 
A/H3N2 virus A/Tokyo/Ut-Sk-1/07. The recombinant viruses were tested for susceptibility to the 
neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir.  The H3N2 virus with the N294S substitution and the 
parent virus had similar fold changes in susceptibility to zanamivir and oseltamivir relative to the 
reference strain (zanamivir fold change = 2.44; oseltamivir fold change = 0.95), which is within the 
normal level of inhibition as defined by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. However, the N294S 
substitution in this NA background may impact viral fitness as the virus could not be propagated in a 
second passage in tissue culture. It was concluded that the N294S amino acid substitution does not confer 
resistance to either zanamivir or oseltamivir in this NA background.  
Several cell culture passages of the T325I recombinant virus have been attempted, but virus of a 
sufficient titre to perform a susceptibility assay could not be obtained. Therefore, the T325I substitution 
appears to reduce fitness of the virus; this substitution may confer zanamivir resistance, although 
conclusive data could not be obtained as the virus could not be cultured. In addition, the NA 325 residue 
is a position of variability, as substitutions at this position in other subtypes have conferred reductions in 
susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors.  
Case reports of resistance observed in the clinic after treatment with Zanamivir 
Resistance analysis carried out in clinical studies of inhaled zanamivir and information on resistance 
reported in the literature to both inhaled and intravenous zanamivir are summarized. All case reports 
describing IV Zanamivir were from participation in the CUP (Compassionate Use Program). 
As of June 2017 there have been nine reported cases of zanamivir resistant viruses isolated from 
immunocompromised patients:

The NAIs which have been granted marketing authorisations (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and laninamivir) target the same region, the active site of the NA 
molecule, and therefore it may be expected that the four drugs would show high levels of cross-resistance. However, because the four molecules bind in different 
ways within the active site, not all substitutions show cross-resistance and the levels of resistance observed are different. These differences could be important 
in immunocompromised patients and when resistant virus is in circulation.  Zanamivir ’s structure is closely related to the natural substrate of NA and this 
contributes to the high barrier to resistance. Resistance to zanamivir following treatment is rare but resistance following oseltamivir treatment is in the order of 
about 1% (Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network, 2011). The caveat is that oseltamivir is used to treat influenza infection much more often than

zanamivir. The majority of oseltamivir resistant viruses, the most common being H275Y variants, are sensitive to zanamivir and therefore patients with these 
resistant viruses can be treated with zanamivir. 
There have been nine case reports in the scientific literature of treatment emergent resistant viruses with known resistance substitutions isolated from 
immunocompromised patients who received IV zanamivir via the CUP and one from an immunocompromised adult from study NAI113678 (E119D), who died on 
the study. Influenza infections in immunocompromised patients have been shown to have prolonged viral replication despite antiviral therapy, and therefore an 
increased risk of antiviral resistance emergence and persistent illness. 
There is some evidence that selection of resistance during IV zanamivir treatment is slightly higher than treatment with inhaled zanamivir. Two treatment 
emergent NA resistance substitutions, E119D and E119G, were detected in post Baseline samples in study NAI113678, the latter from an immunocompetent 
paediatric subject. By contrast, prior to the 2009 pandemic, only one resistant influenza B virus has been reported during treatment with inhaled (nebulised) 
zanamivir in an immunocompromised patient. The higher baseline viral loads and prolonged duration of shedding in hospitalised patients may account for the 
slightly higher frequency of resistance selection in subjects receiving IV zanamivir, although they are still rare occurrences. 
Zanamivir is active against the majority of oseltamivir resistant viruses including those with the most common oseltamivir resistant substitution, H275Y. In 
2008/2009 viruses harbouring the H275Y substitution acquired compensatory substitutions that enabled the viruses to readily transmit and rapidly became the 
predominant influenza A H1N1 virus circulating globally. Although similar events have not occurred with the current circulating influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus 
there have been clusters of transmittable viruses with the H275Y substitution. If widespread resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir were to occur, the only 
available treatment option active against H275Y viruses might be zanamivir.

Study Number: NAI114346:  A Phase I, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Four-Way Crossover Study to Evaluate the Effect of Intravenous 
Zanamivir on Cardiac Conduction as Assessed by 12-lead Electrocardiogram with Moxifloxacin as a Positive Control in Healthy Volunteers. 
Study period: 
Initiation Date: 19 May 2011, Completion Date: 02 August 2011 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018

Objectives: 
Primary 
• To demonstrate a lack of QT prolongation from single IV dose of zanamivir 600 mg and 1200 mg (standard dose and supra-therapeutic dose) as determined 
by the baseline-adjusted, maximum time-matched QTcF effect compared to placebo. 
Criteria for evaluation: 
Primary 
• Change from baseline in QTcF for zanamivir. 
Secondary 
• Change from baseline in QTcB, QTci, QT, and HR. 
• Pharmacokinetic parameters of AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), Cmax, tmax, CL, Vz, and t½ from serum zanamivir concentration-time data and (if needed) AUC(0-t), 
AUC(0-∞), Cmax, tmax, CL/F, Vz/F, and t½ from plasma moxifloxacin concentration-time data. 
• Safety and tolerability of zanamivir as assessed by change from baseline in 12-lead ECGs, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), AEs, and toxicity grading 
of clinical laboratory tests. 
Subject Disposition and Demographics: A total of 40 subjects were enrolled into this study. Two subjects withdrew from the study after Period 1: one subject due 
to investigator discretion and another subject did not return for Period 2 and was lost to follow-up. 
There were more males (63%) than females (38%) and the mean age of the subjects was 30 years. Most subjects were either Caucasians (60%) or of African 
American/African heritage (28%). 
On Day 1 of each period, IV zanamivir or placebo for zanamivir was administered in blinded fashion as 30-min IV infusions. Oral moxifloxacin (positive control) 
or placebo for moxifloxacin was also administered in a single blind fashion at the same time the IV dose was started. 
Each subject participated in the study for approximately 9 weeks i.e., 30 day screening period, 4-week treatment period, and a 5-7 day follow-up period. There 
were four treatment sequences with a 5-7 day washout between treatments. 
Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) including continuous Holter monitoring, clinical laboratory safety tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, 
adverse event (AE) reports, and PK samples were collected throughout the study. In each treatment period, a Holter monitor was used to measure cardiac 
conduction from pre-dose on the morning of Day 1 until the morning of Day 2 with the recording card being changed pre-dose on Day 1. Triplicate ECG readings 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018  
Page 43/143 
 
  
 
 
were extracted from the Holter monitor data for analysis on Day 1 at three timepoints pre-dose (-1.5, -1.0 and -0.5 hours pre-dose) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 
3, 4, 6.5, 8.5, 12, and 24-hours post-dose. 
A follow-up visit was conducted 5-7 days after administration of the last dose of study medication in treatment period 4.

Treatments: 
A: Single dose IV Zanamivir 600 mg over 30 minutes + oral moxifloxacin placebo. 
B: Single dose IV Zanamivir 1200 mg over 30 minutes + oral moxifloxacin placebo. 
For both dose levels, mean values for CL, volumes of distribution and t½ are essentially the same, indicating dose independence. Inter-subject variability was 
low for all PK parameters, as characterized by CVb% values ranging from 12-19%. Statistical results from regression analysis of dose proportionality by the 
power model (y = α*Dose β) indicate that Cmax and AUC(0-∞) were proportional to IV zanamivir dose.

Based on the results above, the upper limit of the 90% CI for ΔΔQTcF (correcting for baseline and placebo) and ΔQTcF (correcting for baseline only) is 2.661 msec 
and 3.566 msec, respectively, which suggests that Zanamivir will not have an effect on ΔΔQTcF and ΔQTcF at a peak concentration that is approximately two-fold 
greater than the expected Cmax from the highest dose (600 mg) evaluated in ongoing Phase II and Phase III clinical studies and currently considered as the 
standard clinical dose. 
Conclusions: 
• Single therapeutic (600 mg) and supra-therapeutic (1200 mg) doses of IV zanamivir were well-tolerated in this study of healthy subjects. 
• Zanamivir pharmacokinetics from IV administration demonstrated low inter-subject variability (12-19%) and was dose proportional from the 600 mg and 1200 
mg doses. 
• The study was sensitive enough to detect the effect of moxifloxacin, the positive control on QTcF, confirming that this study was valid for assessing the effects 
of IV zanamivir on cardiac repolarization. 
• IV zanamivir had no effect on cardiac repolarization at either the anticipated therapeutic dose (600 mg) or supra-therapeutic (1200 mg) dose. 
DER relationships 
No exposure-response relationship was established in single studies or by PKPD model analysis of clinical response data. Simulations predicted that the 
percentage of subjects that have the entire dosing interval above in vitro IC50 and IC90 values (influenza virus A and B) were >95.5 and >97% following 300 mg 
BID and 600 mg BID, respectively. Frequency of dosing appeared to be more important than amount given in a single dose (300 or 600 mg) with respect to 
keeping the exposure in subjects with influenza above in vitro IC50 and IC90 values for the A and B viruses, consistent with the PK characteristics of zanamivir.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
popPK: The model is considered to be of moderate regulatory impact as it is used to support dose 
recommendations in adult patients with impaired renal function and in paediatric/adolescent patients with 
normal or impaired renal function. Appropriate, standard methods have been used and the results are 
adequately presented. In general, the dataset includes wide ranges of covariates although the majority of 
subjects were Caucasians, and PK data obtained from children, patients with ESRD, ECMO or renal 
replacement therapy are limited. The ranges of covariates have been presented and all have been 
screened for potential relationship with the etas (η).  
Several issues were addressed at Day121 to further substantiate the suitability of the model, which 
pertains to the following: 
The BLQ observations, which accounted for approximately 8.5% of available data, mainly occurred at 
pre-dose (~72%). The BLQ observations are thus not likely to impact on model performance, and 
exclusion of the BLQ observations from the model dataset is acceptable. 
Weight was not included as a covariate, but was included in the calculation of CLCr. The effect of WT on 
CL was estimated to be only 0.137 with poor precision (RSE = 42%) and effects of CrCl and WT on CL 
were considerably correlated (>0.7). This suggested that CrCl plays a more dominant role in describing 
CL than WT, thus weight was dropped from the model. It is noted that the proposed posology is to some 
extent weight based and this results in lighter subjects receiving lower doses than would be predicted 
based on allometry alone. Therefore, the risk is to efficacy rather than safety. 
By inspection of the pcVPCs, the model appears to describe the observed data reasonably well. Although 
data are sparse for some subgroups, it is agreed that in general the model appears to be fit-for-purpose 
and could be used to make dose recommendations in renally impaired adults and children. The final model 
building dataset included PK data from 7, 7 and 12 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to <1 year, 1 to <2 
years and 2 to <6 years, respectively. 
The applicant places considerable weight on pcVPC plots for efficacy. The PKPD is not well understood, but 
time above IC50 or IC90 could be important (see PD discussion). It is noted that the goal is to target 
similar overall exposures rather than trough concentrations. The plots provided show a reasonable 
prediction of the trough concentrations, although there is an over-prediction in patients (with no specific 
trend based on age, body weight or renal impairment) which should be considered when proposing dose 
recommendations. From the safety and efficacy perspective, the adult trough PK data do not raise major 
concerns. However, there is a concern that in children efficacy may not be maintained. 
Simulated initial and steady state exposures (including peak and trough concentrations) for the different 
age and renal groups were in excess of the IC50 and IC90 values for the influenza B strains (day 180 
response). Although the exposure observed in paediatrics with severe renal impairment was lower than 
that of the adults, the plasma concentration was maintained above the IC50 and IC90 values for the B 
influenza strains despite the 24-48 hour dose delay between initial dose and BID maintenance dosing. 
Steady-state were quickly achieved. 
Accumulation of drug is seen in subjects with influenza following repeated administration, consistent with 
the 24% decrease in clearance estimated in subjects infected with influenza in the popPK analysis. The 
accumulation tend to increase with increase in impairment of renal function. 
Bioequivalence: Formally, BE to the marketed oseltamivir capsules, was not fully demonstrated for the 
oseltamivir over-encapsulated formulation.   
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 47/143 
 
 
  
  
Distribution: The binding of 14C-zanamivir to human plasma proteins and red blood cells was found to be 
negligible (≤10%) over the investigated concentration range (0.05, 0.5, 10 µg/ml) and is likely not 
clinically relevant. The volume of distribution (18.8L) is relatively low, slightly exceeds the volume of 
extracellular water (~16 L) and is consistent with zanamivir physicochemical characteristics as a polar 
compound with low protein binding. 
The observed trough concentrations indicate that zanamivir concentrations in the upper and lower 
respiratory epithelium following the proposed posology would be in excess of the highest in vitro IC50 
values and IC90 value for influenza virus neuraminidase (range: <1 to 4 ng/ml and range: ~1.7 to 7.8 
ng/ml, respectively), and the in vitro IC90 values for influenza virus Type A (1.8 ng/ml) and influenza B 
(7.8 ng/mL). However, an interpretation of these PK data in terms of relationship to efficacy against 
influenza virus in the target population is not possible. 
Metabolism & elimination: The individual studies as well as the popPK analysis indicate that zanamivir 
undergoes extensive renal elimination as unchanged drug. It appears that renal excretion is comparable 
to GFR and that active renal secretion is not likely. Since zanamivir is mainly recovered unchanged in 
urine in humans, consistently shown in several clinical studies, the lack of a mass balance study is 
acceptable. The potential consequences of possible genetic polymorphism has not been discussed. 
Considering the apparent lack of zanamivir metabolism, this is acceptable. 
Dose proportionality & time dependency: Dose-linear exposure has been demonstrated (1 mg to 
1200mg). Zanamivir does not appear to demonstrate time-dependent PK. 
Variability: There was a higher inter-individual variability in infected patients vs. healthy subjects. For 
example, in healthy subjects with normal renal function the inter-individual variability (IIV) for plasma 
zanamivir after BID dosing has been mostly < 15%. However, the popPK model estimated that IIV on CL 
was  69.4%,  which  was  3.1  times  larger  in  influenza  infected  subjects  than  in  healthy  subjects  with 
comparable renal function. Also, the data in patients do not suggest linearity in PK between 300 and 600 
mg doses. Some of this observed difference in IIV might be due to rapid shifts in renal function during 
recovery from acute infection. Overall, the differences between healthy subjects and patients are not a 
concern. 
Target population & impaired renal function: Renal impairment has a significant effect on zanamivir PK, 
and dose adjustment is thus required for IV zanamivir administration in patients with decreased renal 
function. The target population is expected to include a relatively large proportion of patients with 
pre-existing renal impairment and/or decrease in renal function due to the underlying infection. 
The proposed posology includes a 600 mg loading dose (irrespective of renal function), followed by 
reductions in maintenance dose when CrCL is <80 ml/min with prolonged administration of the second 
dose. The loading dose approach appears reasonable as single dose Cmax was unaffected by renal function. 
Although the DER relationship is not known, it is a well-established principle that treatment should be 
initiated as early as possible. As a result, the Day 1 exposure will be higher compared to the following 
treatment days. 
There is no scientific rationale for the infusion time of 30 minutes, which results in a high Cmax, when the 
applicant’s aim is to achieve target trough concentrations. The serum and ELF levels, especially trough 
levels,  have  simply  been  compared  to  concentrations  determined  to  be  required  for  neuraminidase 
inhibition and for in-vitro virus neutralisation. There is no concern regarding the safety of this infusion 
time in terms of local tolerance or AEs that could be related to Cmax. 
The renal impairment study did not enrol subjects with ESRD requiring dialysis, and only four subjects 
were included per cohort which is considered to be too few. Only one subject in the severe renal 
impairment cohort had CLCr <20 ml/min. The investigated dose was only 100 mg, despite scientific 
advice (2006) where it was suggested to use a dose as close as possible to the dose to be evaluated in the 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 48/143 
 
 
  
  
clinical studies (i.e. 600 mg). A renal impairment study performed in accordance to the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/83874/2014) would have provided further data on which to base the dose recommendations 
in patients with renal impairment. 
In study NAI113678, paediatric subjects received an age-adjusted, weight-based dose intended to 
provide comparable systemic exposures to 600 mg BID in adults. Paediatric/adolescent subjects with 
renal impairment received an adjusted maintenance dose of IV zanamivir based on calculated CLcr 
consistent with the dosing strategy in renally impaired adults. Paediatric/adolescent subjects received an 
initial dose of 14 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg (not to exceed 600 mg) regardless of renal function, followed first by 
a delay and then a twice daily maintenance dose according to their effective renal function. 
Haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are likely to remove zanamivir from the circulation. Zanamivir is 
also expected to be removed by CRRT and it seems appropriate that the dose should be selected using the 
appropriate CRRT clearance for the patient. Although the PK appeared similar compared to subjects not 
receiving such supportive measures, data are available for only a limited number of subjects on CRRT and 
no definite conclusions can be drawn. Additionally, there are limited data on patients on dialysis. 
Subject 1191 in NAI113678 had very high plasma concentrations, which is most likely explained by a 
sampling error where blood was drawn from the infusion arm. 
Gender: The popPK analysis did not support a co-variate effect on the PK and no dose adjustment 
accounting for gender is recommended. 
Race: In a popPK analysis race was not shown to impact on zanamivir CL, however the dataset consisted 
of predominantly Caucasians. No dose adjustment according to race is proposed which is found 
acceptable. 
Impaired liver function: The effect of liver impairment on zanamivir PK has not been assessed which is 
acceptable considering the low protein binding and predominant renal elimination of zanamivir. 
Weight: Creatinine clearance appears to play a more dominant role in describing CL than WT, and weight 
was not included as a covariate in the popPK model (see above). 
Elderly: No dedicated PK study in the elderly was performed. The popPK analysis did not support a 
co-variate effect on the PK and no dose adjustment is required based on age. 
DDI: Zanamivir is primarily renally eliminated and no metabolites have been identified. The absence of 
studies investigating zanamivir as a CYP enzyme substrate is thus acceptable. 
The CYP inhibition and induction interaction potential at clinically relevant concentrations is low. Likewise, 
the transporter inhibition potential of zanamivir is low. Zanamivir is not a substrate of human drug 
transporters. Based on a SIMCYP Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, the risk of 
CYP3A4 induction at clinically relevant concentrations is considered to be low. The current PBPK model 
and qualification data set for this application can therefore be considered acceptable to indicate a low risk 
of CYP3A4 induction with zanamivir 600 mg IV BID and the proposed SmPC wording (SmPC 4.5 and 5.2) 
is agreed.  It is also considered that the clinical risk is reduced by the short-term administration of 
zanamivir and its proposed use in a hospitalised setting where potential drug interactions can be 
monitored.   
The in vivo DDI study investigating the impact of zanamivir on oseltamivir PK was performed in healthy 
Thai subjects, which may not be representative to the Caucasian population. However, published 
literature indicates that renal transporters OAT1 and OAT2 have low potential for genetic and functional 
diversity. 
No other in vivo studies investigating the DDI potential when zanamivir is combined with other commonly 
used medications (e.g. paracetamol) have been performed.

Primary pharmacology 
Study NAIA 1010 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study in 16 healthy male serologically 
susceptible (HI antibody titer of ≤1:8 to the challenge strain) subjects to evaluate the effect of zanamivir 
administered intravenously in preventing illness and reducing viral replication following inoculation with 
influenza A virus. The infection rate was the main endpoint, but a number of other evaluations were 
performed, including clinical symptoms, serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody, nasal discharge and 
cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). 
This challenge study in healthy volunteers represent a proof of concept for the ability to zanamivir to 
prevent influenza A infection, virus replication and disease symptoms when IV zanamivir is administered 
4 hours prior to virus inoculation.  This was an experimental placebo-controlled challenge study in 16 
healthy males, not influenza patients.  Also, IV zanamivir was given prior to inoculation with influenza 
virus, so the relevance to the indication applied for is minor. 
Clinical Virology / Resistance 
See discussion on clinical efficacy for more details on virology from the clinical studies. 
The most commonly occurring influenza virus oseltamivir resistance substitution (H275Y) confers high 
level resistance to oseltamivir (and moderate level resistance to peramivir), but remains sensitive to 
zanamivir. In 2007-2009 viruses harbouring the H275Y substitution became widespread and within one 
year comprised nearly 100% of circulating influenza A/H1N1 viruses. There was a low incidence of H275Y 
during the Phase III study (NAI114373) so it was not possible to demonstrate clinical efficacy of IV 
zanamivir in this population. 
In the setting of widespread resistance to oseltamivir or peramivir, zanamivir may be the only available 
treatment option for patients with influenza. 
Many patients identified with oseltamivir resistant virus are also immunocompromised and thus at high 
risk of severe illness and complications of influenza, as well as a longer duration of severe illness due to 
a reduced ability to clear virus. Published reports from the IV zanamivir Compassionate Use Program 
highlight a number of these cases for whom IV zanamivir was requested due to the current lack of 
adequate treatment options. 
Resistance to zanamivir during treatment is rare reflecting its high barrier to resistance. Resistance to 
zanamivir was not observed in more than 14,000 subjects participating in treatment and prophylaxis 
clinical studies evaluating the inhaled zanamivir formulation, although the first report of resistance was in 
an immunocompromised child in 1998. In the IV zanamivir clinical studies, 1 resistance substitution was 
detected in an immunocompromised adult (N=130) and 1 in an immunocompetent child in study 
NAI113678 (N=71), who received prior oseltamivir treatment. In NAI114373, 1 potential resistance 
substitution was detected on Day 2 in an immunocompetent subject in the 300 mg arm (N=163) and none 
were detected in the 600 mg arm (N=162). 
Secondary pharmacology 
A phase I, randomised, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study was performed to evaluate the 
effect of intravenous zanamivir on cardiac conduction as assessed by 12-lead electrocardiogram with 
moxifloxacin as a positive control in healthy volunteers. 
Zanamivir pharmacokinetics from IV administration demonstrated low inter-subject variability (12-19%) 
and was dose proportional from the 600 mg and 1200 mg doses. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 50/143 
 
 
  
  
 
The study was sensitive enough to detect the effect of moxifloxacin, the positive control on QTcF, 
confirming that this study was valid for assessing the effects of IV zanamivir on cardiac repolarization. 
IV zanamivir had no effect on cardiac repolarisation at either the anticipated therapeutic dose (600 mg) 
or supra-therapeutic (1200 mg) dose. 
DER relationships 
With only one dose level (and dose adjustments according to renal function) in study NAI113678, the 
variability in exposure was not sufficient to elucidate a PKPD relationship. Additionally, the investigated 
doses of 300mg and 600 mg (study NAI114373 and PKPD model) are potentially at the flat higher end 
of the PKPD curve. 
The applicant has in a response explained why it is considered that comparing plasma and Epithelial 
Lining Fluid (ELF) exposures with IC values is a valid approach to justifying the clinical dose. 
Pharmacokinetic studies of zanamivir have demonstrated drug penetration into the pulmonary 
compartment following intravenous (IV) administration of 600 mg zanamivir and have established the 
ELF drug trough concentrations as 419 ng/ml. It has also been shown that following IV administration of 
zanamivir 600 mg dose BID, drug concentrations in ELF are 73% of serum drug concentrations. During 
influenza infection, viral replication takes place in the pulmonary compartment which is the same site ELF 
drug concentrations are measured and is therefore the appropriate site to measure drug concentrations 
for efficacy. ELF 12-hour concentrations (trough) were comparable following twice daily administration of 
oral inhaled zanamivir 10 mg (the approved dose) and twice daily administration of IV zanamivir 600 mg. 
There is currently lack of a clearly defined pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter 
linked to virologic (and clinical) efficacy for inhaled zanamivir or IV zanamivir. In an experimental in vitro 
hollow-fiber infection model utilizing oseltamivir sensitive and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, investigators 
at the Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infections at the Center for Medical Sciences predicted 
AUC/half maximal effective concentration (EC50) as the PD index for IV zanamivir 600 mg if dosed every 
8 hours, which is the same predicted PD marker for other NAI in this model. However, when dosed at 600 
mg every 12 hours, the Time >EC50 was the PD index that best predicted suppression of viral replication. 
Zanamivir drug concentrations above viral IC50 values provided sustained viral suppression, reducing 
peak viral titres by approximately 4 log10 PFU/ml and reducing the probability of resistance selection. 
Therefore, a single PK/PD index may not be sufficient to describe optimal therapeutic regimens for all 
patient groups.  
The applicant stressed that several prior applications for various antiviral agents have also focussed on 
trough levels being maintained over in vitro values derived from enzyme and/or viral inhibition studies. At 
this stage it seems unlikely that it would be fruitful to pursue this matter. The relationship between serum 
and ELF concentrations and the IC50 or IC90 values has been well described and do suggest that the 
selected dose would be adequate to exert the described antiviral effect. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Considering the relatively simple PK of zanamivir, the clinical pharmacological investigation programme is 
overall acceptable.  
The challenge study in healthy volunteers represents a proof of concept for the ability of zanamivir to 
prevent influenza A infection, virus replication and disease symptoms when IV Zanamivir is administered 
4 hours prior to virus inoculation. This was an experimental placebo-controlled challenge study in 16 
healthy males, not influenza patients. Also, IV zanamivir was given prior to inoculation with influenza 
virus, so the relevance to the indication applied for is minor. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 51/143 
 
 
  
  
The most commonly occurring influenza virus oseltamivir resistance substitution (H275Y) confers high 
level resistance to oseltamivir (and moderate level resistance to peramivir), but remains sensitive to 
zanamivir. There was a low incidence of H275Y during the Phase III study (NAI114373) so it was not 
possible to demonstrate clinical efficacy of IV zanamivir in this population. In the setting of widespread 
resistance to oseltamivir or peramivir, zanamivir may be the only available treatment option for patients 
with influenza. 
It should be noted that section 5.1 of the SmPC has been revised to add a section on resistance: 
Resistance 
Resistance selection during zanamivir treatment is rare. Reduced susceptibility to zanamivir is associated 
with mutations that result in amino acid changes in the viral neuraminidase or viral hemagglutinin or 
both. Neuraminidase substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to zanamivir have emerged during 
treatment with zanamivir in human viruses and those with zoonotic potential: E119D, E119G, I223R, 
R368G, G370D, N434S (A/H1N1); N294S, T325I (A/H3N2); R150K (B); R292K (A/H7N9). The 
neuraminidase substitution Q136K (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), confers high level resistance to zanamivir but 
is selected during adaptation to cell culture and not during treatment. 
The clinical impact of reduced susceptibility in these viruses is unknown, and the effects of specific 
substitutions on virus susceptibility to zanamivir may be strain-dependent. 
A phase I placebo-controlled QT study was sensitive enough to detect the effect of moxifloxacin, the 
positive control on QTcF, confirming that this study was valid for assessing the effects of IV zanamivir on 
cardiac repolarization. IV zanamivir had no effect on cardiac repolarisation at either the anticipated 
therapeutic dose (600 mg) or supra-therapeutic (1200 mg) dose. 
In vitro studies indicate that zanamivir is not an inhibitor or substrate of Breast Cancer Resistant Protein 
(BCRP), P-glycoprotein, Multidrug And Toxin Extrusion protein (MATE)1, MATE2-K, Organic Anion 
Transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 and Organic 
Cation Transporter (OCT)2 transporters, nor is it an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. 
Zanamivir is not an inducer of CYP1A2 and 2B6 and, although induction of CYP3A4 in vitro was observed 
at 50-fold higher than the clinically relevant concentrations, no interaction with CYP3A4 substrates is 
expected based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling.

NAI114373. The main study NAI114373 was randomized, double-blind, with three arms comparing 600 
mg IV Zanamivir with comparator 75 mg oral oseltamivir and 300 mg IV Zanamivir.  
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of 600 mg of IV Zanamivir twice daily compared to 75 mg 
of oral oseltamivir twice daily, and 600 mg IV Zanamivir twice daily compared to 300 mg IV Zanamivir 
twice daily on time to clinical response (TTCR). The patient population was hospitalised adults and 
adolescents (> 16 years) with influenza. 
Due to lack of randomized studies in patients hospitalised for influenza comparing the effect of 
neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo, a non-inferiority margin to compare Zanamivir with oseltamivir 
could not be estimated.  Therefore, a superiority analysis for the primary endpoint was the only option for 
a formal statistical comparison.  
NAI113678. The supportive study was open-label, single arm. 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) Zanamivir in the 
treatment of hospitalised adult, adolescent and paediatric subjects with influenza infection. Children age 
categories: 6 months<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <13 years, 13 to <18 years. 
This was mainly a safety study, but virology and clinical endpoints as well as pharmacokinetics were 
included. The study was initiated in 2009 during the H1N1 pandemic and for the adult population 
H1N1pdm2009 was the dominating strain. With no control arm, it is not possible to evaluate efficacy 
based on clinical endpoints. Due to large variability in influenza disease progress and outcome, the use of 
historical control data is of little value. 
NAI115215: The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of 600 mg of IV Zanamivir 
twice daily in the treatment of hospitalised subjects with influenza infection. 
The study title includes “to evaluate safety and efficacy”.  With no control arm, it is not possible to 
evaluate efficacy based on clinical endpoints. 
NAI115008: This was an observational, retrospective, multi-centre, cohort data collection study. The 
treating physician/delegate reviewed the patient’s chart and recorded data including demographics, 
medical data, safety variables and treatment outcomes on a paper CRF.  Efficacy cannot be evaluated 
from this study. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The rationale for selecting 600 mg IV zanamivir hydrate BID as the dose for clinical investigation in 
hospitalised patients with influenza was based on results from nonclinical studies and clinical studies: 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 53/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
•  Nonclinical safety and exposure data. 
•  NAI106784: Pharmacokinetic (PK) study in bronchoalveaolar lavage (BAL) following inhaled and 
IV Zanamivir hydrate administration demonstrating similar pulmonary exposure between the 
approved 10 mg inhaled Zanamivir hydrate dose and the 600 mg IV Zanamivir hydrate dose. 
•  NAIA1010: An experimental influenza challenge study in healthy volunteers demonstrating the 
significant clinical prophylactic and antiviral effect of 600 mg IV Zanamivir hydrate BID. 
•  Compassionate Use Programme (REL113375): Zanamivir hydrate (600 mg BID) aqueous 
solution supply on a compassionate use basis to hospitalised patients with serious influenza 
illness who have no other treatment options (Ongoing since May 2009 with >3,000 patients 
treated). 
In the clinical development programme for IV Zanamivir hydrate the dosage regimen of 600 mg BID was 
investigated in both the Phase II (NAI113678) and single pivotal Phase III (NAI114373) studies. An 
additional dosing regimen of 300 mg BID was investigated in the single pivotal Phase III study 
(NAI114373) as a result of CHMP scientific advice with lack of formal dose-ranging in the development 
programme been noted. 
Main study 
NAI 114373:  
A Phase III international, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of 300 mg or 600 mg of intravenous zanamivir twice daily compared to 75 
mg of oral oseltamivir twice daily in the treatment of hospitalized adults and adolescents with 
influenza 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible subjects were aged at least 16 years with: 
Fever [oral temperature ≥38 0C, rectal/core, tympanic ≥38.5 0C or axilla ≥37.4 0C] or history of fever 
within the prior 24 h or reported feverishness within the prior 48 h 
AND at least 2 out of the following 4: 
o  Oxygen  saturation  <95%  on  room  air  by  trans-cutaneous  method  or  need  for  any  supplemental 
oxygenation or ventilatory support or increase in oxygen supplementation requirement of ≥2 litres 
for subjects with chronic oxygen dependency; in chronic hypoxia without supplemental oxygen an 
oxygen saturation ≥ 3% below the historical baseline oxygen saturation was required 
o 
Respiration  rate  >24  breaths  per  minute  (unless  receiving  ventilatory  support  or  oxygen 
supplementation) 
o  Heart rate >100 beats per minute 
o 
Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg 
Onset of influenza symptoms was to be within 6 days prior to enrolment with a positive influenza 
diagnostic test result or strong suspicion of influenza based on local surveillance information. 
There was to be sufficient severity of any medical illness that, in the Investigator’s judgement, justified 
hospitalisation of the subject for treatment and supportive care. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 54/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The main exclusion criteria, in addition to hypersensitivity were: 
- Subjects who had taken more than a total of 3 days of approved anti-influenza therapy in the period 
from onset of symptoms and prior to enrolment.  
- Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator were not likely to survive beyond 48 hours from 
Baseline.  
- Subjects with creatinine clearance ≤ 10 ml/min.  
- Subjects who required (ECMO) at Baseline.  
- Subjects with liver toxicity or underlying chronic liver disease or history of severe cardiac disease. 
This included, but was not limited to subjects who were intubated/ventilated, pregnant, 
immunocompromised, HIV positive or had renal impairment and subjects who may have received prior 
licensed anti-influenza medication. 
Treatments 
IV Zanamivir hydrate 
Zanamivir hydrate aqueous solution, 10 mg/ml, was supplied as a single use, sterile clear, colorless 
preparation tonicity adjusted with sodium chloride and presented in 20 ml clear glass vials closed with 
rubber stoppers. Each vial contained 200 mg Zanamivir hydrate.  
Zanamivir hydrate aqueous solution could have been administered as supplied or as an infusion in 0.9% 
sodium chloride for intravenous administration. 
Placebo to Match IV Zanamivir hydrate 
No vials of placebo to match IV Zanamivir hydrate were provided, instead a normal saline solution of a 
matched volume was prepared by an unblinded pharmacist at site to act as a placebo to active IV 
Zanamivir hydrate. 
Oral Oseltamivir 
Oseltamivir (TAMIFLU) was provided as 75 mg capsules (Roche Pharmaceuticals). Product for this study 
was sourced in the US and was over-encapsulated. 
Over-encapsulation of oseltamivir was necessary to maintain the study blind. There were no other 
manipulation or changes to the capsule or the active powder contained within the capsule. GSK has 
conducted in vitro dissolution testing of marketed oseltamivir capsules in comparison to the 
over-encapsulated capsules and, as expected, there was a small delay (10-20 minutes) in the time for 
complete dissolution of the over-encapsulated oseltamivir relative to the standard capsule; however, 
both forms were fully dissolved within approximately 30 minutes. Oseltamivir is a prodrug that is readily 
absorbed and extensively converted over approximately 4 hours to the active metabolite, oseltamivir 
carboxylate, which is responsible for its antiviral activity. GSK has conducted a bioequivalence study 
evaluating the pharmacokinetic properties of the over-encapsulated oseltamivir 75 mg capsules used as 
a blinded comparator in this study relative to the commercially available 75 mg capsules. Results from the 
study demonstrated bioequivalence of the over-encapsulated and commercial capsules [Study 
NAI115096].

Placebo to Match Oseltamivir 
Placebo to match oral oseltamivir was supplied as capsules with a common excipient of appropriate 
quality. 
Dose and Administration 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms.

Subjects randomised to IV Zanamivir hydrate received placebo to match oral oseltamivir twice daily. 
Subjects randomised to oral oseltamivir received a normal saline infusion as a placebo to match IV 
Zanamivir hydrate. 
Where possible, the IV and oral IP were administered at approximately the same time. 
Subjects and all site staff were blinded to the study treatment. However, the pharmacist (or an 
appropriately qualified member of staff not involved in the routine care and management of subjects) was 
unblinded to allow preparation of study drugs. 
Duration of Treatment 
The duration of randomized treatment was 5 days. However, for a given subject, the initial 5-day 
treatment course may have been extended for up to 5 additional days if clinical symptoms or patient 
characteristics as assessed by the investigator warranted further treatment. Alternatively, if the 
investigator considered that a subject was failing to improve clinically on their randomized treatment, the 
investigator could choose to initiate the switch/rescue option on Day 6 through Day 10 for up to 5 days. 
With inclusion of the switch/rescue option, the maximum duration of treatment was up to 14 days.

Sample size 
The study was planned to have 160 influenza positive subjects per arm at a two-sided significance level 
of α=0.05 and power of over 90% under the assumptions of 1.5 days difference between the primary 
comparisons (i.e., the 600 mg IV zanamivir hydrate arm versus oral oseltamivir arm or the 600 mg IV 
Zanamivir hydrate arm versus 300 mg IV zanamivir hydrate arm) and standard deviation of 4 days based 
on TTCR. Therefore, a total of 600 subjects were planned to be enrolled into the study in order to have 480 
influenza positive subjects assuming an estimated 80% of subjects were influenza positive. The power 
was 84% at a two-sided α=0.02 under the same assumptions. 
At the final analysis, the primary endpoint of TTCR was tested at a 2-sided α = 0.02 for each of the two 
pairwise comparisons in IPP. Additionally, these tests were performed at a 2-sided α = 0.0075 in the two 
pre-specified subgroups. The alpha levels for the statistical tests and comparisons were chosen 
empirically with the aim of controlling the overall Type 1 error at 5% under multiplicity adjustment. The 
study had over 90% power and 65% power under the assumption of benefit in the symptom onset ≤4 
days subgroup and ICU/Mechanical ventilation subgroup, respectively. 
Based on the second interim analysis the influenza positive rate was about 78%, therefore 615 subjects 
were needed to be enrolled in order to have 480 IPP subjects. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule. Subjects were 
stratified based on time from onset of symptoms to initiation of treatment into one of two strata (≤4 days 
and 5 to 6 days) prior to randomization.  
Randomization was conducted via a central randomization procedure following confirmation of fulfilment 
of study entry criteria. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to study treatment in accordance with 
the computer generated randomisation schedule. The randomisation schedule, including stratification, 
was generated using the GSK validated randomization software RANDALL. 
GSK used an interactive voice response system, Registration and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS), 
for registration of subjects. Study site personnel were required to call RAMOS to register each subject 
participating in the study. Upon randomization, subjects were allocated a treatment number. 
Oseltamivir/placebo treatment assignment information was provided via RAMOS, and the unblinded 
pharmacist referred to the randomization schedule for zanamivir hydrate/placebo treatment assignment 
information.

Page 60/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind, double-dummy study and both subject and study staff were blinded to 
treatment, however an unblinded pharmacist (or an appropriately qualified member of staff not involved 
in the routine care and management of subjects) at each study site was unblinded to allow preparation of 
study drugs. 
During the blinded randomized treatment period, subjects received an IV infusion (zanamivir hydrate or 
placebo) twice daily plus an oral therapy (oseltamivir or placebo) twice daily via the unblinded 
pharmacist. 
• 
IV infusion: An unblinded pharmacist prepared an IV infusion of active zanamivir hydrate (300 mg 
or 600 mg, adjusted for renal function as appropriate) or a normal saline infusion for each subject 
twice daily. 
•  Oral therapy: An unblinded pharmacist prepared an oral therapy (oseltamivir or placebo) for each 
subject twice daily (or once daily dependent on renal function). For subjects who could swallow 
capsules, the oral therapy was administered as blinded capsules. For subjects who could not swallow 
capsules, oseltamivir powder/placebo powder was extracted from the capsule and mixed with food, 
or prepared as a suspension for administration via nasogastric, nasojejunal or gastrostomy tube.  
Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating physician only in the case of a medical 
emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the investigational product 
was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. GSK Global Clinical Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff could unblind treatment codes in the event of a serious adverse event 
(SAE).

Intent-To-Treat Exposed Population (ITT-E) = all treated 
Influenza Positive Population (IPP) = ITT-E population with proven influenza (positive PCR, culture or 
serology test as determined by the central virology laboratory). The IPP was used for the primary 
efficacy analyses. 
Influenza  Positive,  Oseltamivir  Resistant  Population  (IPR)  =  IPP  with  virus  showing  reduced 
susceptibility to oseltamivir and/or presence of H275Y; this was not used due to too few subjects.  
Per Protocol Population (PP) = IPP who had post-baseline data and no important protocol deviations.  
The PP population was used for sensitivity analysis in the primary efficacy comparisons. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 61/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Subpopulations and subgroups 
Sub-populations of interest were created as subsets of the ITT-E or IPP populations, including 
randomisation strata, viral load, demographic category, age and ethnic origin categories and/or 
geographic locations. 
Interim analyses 
The first interim analysis was conducted when 150 subjects had completed the study to determine 
whether one dose of IV zanamivir was more favourable than the other (based on safety, clinical and 
virologic assessments), whether one or both doses of IV zanamivir were significantly superior to 
oseltamivir, or whether there were insufficient data to recommend discontinuation of a treatment arm.  
The statistical comparisons on the primary efficacy endpoint between the zanamivir and oseltamivir 
groups were performed at alpha level of 0.001. This interim analysis was carried out by the IDMC in 
December 2012 and conditional power estimates and confidence intervals at various significance levels 
were included for IDMC review. 
The second interim analysis was conducted when ~450 subjects had completed the study to determine if 
there was sufficient evidence to justify continuing the study to the target sample size of 600 subjects. This 
second interim analysis was reviewed by the IDMC in August 2014 and allowed for the option of stopping 
the study for futility. At the request of the IDMC the median difference in TTCR between 600 mg IV 
zanamivir and the comparator as well as the associated 95% CI were also provided prior to the IDMC 
meeting. 
The recommendation from both the first and second interim analyses was to continue the study with all 
three treatment arms. Data from the first and second interim analysis were blinded, except to the IDMC. 
Final analyses 
The final statistical analysis and comparison were performed via van Elteren extension of the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test stratified by the randomisation stratification factor (time from symptom onset). Multiplicity 
and overall type I error were controlled at approximately 5%. Within each pairwise comparison the 
fall-back procedure was applied to the following ordered hypothesis tests with the initial pre-specified 
alpha level: H1 – Onset ≤4 days subgroup (α1=0.0075), H2 - ICU subgroup (α2=0.0075), H3 – influenza 
positive population (α3=0.02).  
Time to clinical response 
Two strategies were employed in the determination of TTCR regarding premature discontinuation and/or 
therapy switch prior to reaching the clinical response endpoint, with strategy a) as the primary efficacy 
analysis, and strategy b) as a sensitivity analysis. 
a) Discontinuation/Switch = Failure approach: classified subjects who prematurely discontinued and/or 
switched therapy prior to clinical response as failure if clinical response had not been achieved. Otherwise, 
success or failure of TTCR was determined by the data. All failures were assigned a worst value for TTCR 
(e.g. 99 days). 
b) Observed approach: Used all available data to determine a subject’s success or failure of TTCR, 
regardless of premature discontinuation or therapy switch. Missing data were not imputed. As in a), a 
failure was assigned a worst value to TTCR (e.g. 99 days). 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 62/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Death was considered a failure and assigned a worst value for both cases but deaths which occurred after 
clinical response were not considered as failures. Subjects discharged from hospital were considered to 
have met the clinical response endpoint at the time of discharge if TTCR had not been observed. 
Changes in planned analyses 
After the first interim analysis, resulting in an increase to the sample size to 600 subjects, a protocol 
amendment (04) was implemented to introduce a second interim analysis to inform and the statistical 
analysis framework was updated to allow for consideration of additional evidence beyond the original 
primary and secondary endpoints.

The study duration was approximately 33 days for subjects whose treatment duration was 5 days, up to 
approximately 38 days for subjects whose randomized treatment duration was extended to a maximum 
of 10 days, and up to approximately 42 days for subjects whose randomized and switch/rescue (S/R) 
treatment was extended to a maximum of 14 days. The study consisted of Pre-dose Baseline 
Assessments (Day 1), During Treatment Assessments (Days 1 to 5/6, up to Day 10/11, and S/R Days 1 
to 5/6), and daily Post-Treatment Assessments (PT +1 to +28 Days) while a subject remained 
hospitalized, or PT Assessments on PT +1 to +5, +9, +12, +16, +23, +28 Days if the subject had been 
discharged from hospital. 
Conduct of the study 
Four amendments to the protocol were made; they either occurred early or involved simple 
administrative changes that did not affect the conduct of the study. The exception was the last 
amendment, when 425 had been enrolled. This amendment added a second interim analysis when ~450 
subjects had completed the study or when those randomised by the end of the 2013/2014 Northern 
Hemisphere influenza season (31 March 2014) had completed the study, whichever occurred first. In 
addition, the statistical analysis framework was updated to add some secondary analyses.

Important protocol deviations were reported for 142 subjects (23%) in the ITT-E population with a similar 
across treatment groups. The most common were deviations related to treatment and administration 
which occurred in 10% subjects overall.

If the investigator considered that a subject was failing to improve clinically on their randomized 
double-blind treatment, the investigator could choose to initiate the switch/rescue option (open label 600 
mg IV Zanamivir hydrate) on Day 6 through Day 10 for up to 5 days. A total of 20 subjects in the ITT-E 
population received open-label IV Zanamivir hydrate via the switch/rescue option (5 subjects in the 300 
mg IV Zanamivir hydrate arm, 4 subjects in the 600 mg IV Zanamivir hydrate arm and 11 subjects in the 
oseltamivir arm). Seventeen subjects who received switch/rescue therapy were in the IPP (5 subjects in

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
There were no significant differences in time to clinical response across treatment comparisons in the 
overall IPP or in either of the two pre-specified subgroups, or in the additional post-hoc analyses. A 0.48 
day difference was seen between the 600 mg IV zanamivir hydrate arm and the oseltamivir arm in the 
overall IPP.

The median time to clinical response in days were not statistically different for IV Zanamivir 600 mg and 
oseltamivir 75 mg.  That relates to the total influenza positive population and the subgroups: 
ICU/mechanical ventilation and symptom onset ≤ 4 days, which were part of the primary endpoint 
analysis. Thus, the study failed the primary goal of demonstrating superiority of Zanamivir 600 mg IV 
over oseltamivir 75 mg. Also, post-hoc analysis showed that for the subgroups: symptom onset > 4 days, 
female and male, there were no significant differences between treatments. 
The median time to clinical response was 0.48 days shorter for IV Zanamivir 600 mg compared to 
oseltamivir 75 mg. There was a large non-significant difference in favour of IV zanamivir  in the subgroup 
symptom onset > 4 days, time to clinical response was 9.8 days for zanamivir 600 mg IV and 19 days for 
oseltamivir 75 mg (p value 0.178).

Ancillary analyses 
Clinical response (cumulative incidence) 
The cumulative incidence of clinical response was comparable until about Day 10, after which a higher 
cumulative incidence was observed for the IV zanamivir arms vs. oseltamivir. For 600 mg IV vs. 
oseltamivir, the p-value from the log-rank test adjusting for randomisation stratification was 0.1417.

Figure 3 
The ICU/mechanical ventilation subgroup responded more slowly and with more separation between 
treatment arms. The median treatment difference was 1.79 days in favour of 600 mg IV zanamivir vs. 
oseltamivir. 
Figure 4 
There was more separation observed in the post-hoc analysis of the late symptom onset subgroup (>4 
days) with a slower response in the oseltamivir arm (median treatment difference of 9.50 days in favour 
of 600 mg IV zanamivir compared to oseltamivir). 
An additional post-hoc analysis of gender effect on clinical response did not show a difference in 
cumulative incidence of clinical response by gender. 
Based on Kaplan-Meier, 600 mg IV zanamivir demonstrated improved TTCR vs. oseltamivir in subjects 
receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline (p-value value from log-rank analysis is p=0.0696 and 
p=0.0617 by Wilcoxon-rank sum test). There was an imbalance in mortality across the treatment arms in 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 70/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
this analysis with 5/28 (18%) deaths in the 300 mg IV zanamivir arm, 6/25 (24%) deaths in the 600 mg 
IV zanamivir arm and 3/27 (11%) deaths in the oseltamivir arm.  
The combined analysis of TTCR and time to improvement in respiratory status showed no significant 
difference between either treatment comparison in the overall IPP or the two subgroups.  
Clinical reponse rates by duration ≤5 Day Treatment Course vs >5 Day Treatment Course 
The duration of double-blind treatment detailed in the protocol was 5 days. However, the initial 5-day 
treatment course could have been extended for up to 5 additional days if clinical symptoms or patient 
characteristics as assessed by the investigator warranted further treatment. A summary of length of 
treatment (≤5 Day Treatment Course and >5 Day Treatment Course) for the Influenza Positive 
Population (IPP) is presented below. The majority of subjects (88%) received no more than a 5 day 
course of treatment and treatment was extended in approximately 12% of subjects.

Overall, the clinical response rate was higher in the subgroup of subjects who received ≤5 days of 
treatment, this would be expected compared with those subjects who required the treatment course to be 
extended.

Outcomes by Influenza A and B 
Subtyping results from all available virology assays on all assessment days were taken into account in 
order to obtain comprehensive data on influenza types and subtypes. Using this approach, influenza type 
information was obtained for all 488 subjects in the Influenza Positive Population (IPP). The majority of 
subjects (84%) were infected with influenza A (410 subjects). A total of 70 subjects (14%) were infected 
with influenza B and there were 9 subjects (2%) with co-infections (8 with influenza A & influenza B 
co-infection and one with influenza A subtype coinfection). Influenza subtypes were similar across 
treatment groups. 
Clinical response rates and time to clinical response (TTCR) for subjects in the IPP who were infected with 
influenza A or influenza B are summarised below.  Subjects with co-infection were excluded from the 
analysis. In both subgroups, the proportion of subjects achieving a clinical response was higher in the IV 
zanamivir arms than the oseltamivir arm. Clinical response rates were similar across the subgroups.

compared with 300 mg IV zanamivir or oseltamivir for subjects infected with influenza A or influenza B. 
Outcomes by Time of Symptom Onset Relative to Initiation of Treatment (≤2 Days or >2 
Days) 
Entry criteria allowed for subjects to be included within 6 days of symptom onset. Clinical response rates 
and TTCR for subjects in the IPP with time of symptom onset to initiation of treatment of ≤2 days or >2 
days are summarised below. 
The proportion of subjects who met the criteria for clinical response in the symptom onset ≤2 days 
subgroup were similar across treatment groups with a slightly higher number reaching a clinical response

in the IV zanamivir arms compared with the oseltamivir arm. Similar results were observed in the analysis 
for the symptom onset >2 days subgroup.

Effect of prior oseltamivir therapy  
Up to 3 days (or 6 doses which could span 4 calendar days) of prior anti-influenza therapy was allowed 
including Day 1 (before the first dose of study drug). In the Influenza Positive Population (IPP), 255 
subjects (52%) received prior oseltamivir and the median duration of treatment was 2 days in each 
treatment arm.

Clinical response rates and time to clinical response (TTCR) for subjects in the IPP who did or did not 
receive prior oseltamivir are summarised below. In both subgroups, the proportion of subjects achieving 
a clinical response was higher in the IV zanamivir arms than the oseltamivir arm. Overall, there were 
slightly higher clinical response rates in the subgroup with no prior oseltamivir use.

The median TTCR was longer in subjects who received prior oseltamivir compared with subjects who did 
not receive oseltamivir prior to inclusion into the study for all 3 treatment arms. In subjects who received 
prior oseltamivir, TTCR was longer in the oseltamivir arm compared with both IV zanamivir groups, 
however differences were small. In subjects who did not receive prior oseltamivir, TTCR was longer in the 
oseltamivir arm compared with 600 mg IV zanamivir but not 300 mg IV zanamivir, however differences 
were minimal.

compared to subjects who had not received oseltamivir prior to study treatment. 
Analysis by age category 
The number of subjects enrolled in the pivotal Phase III study NAI114373 are summarised by age (<65, 
65 to <75, 75 to <85 and ≥85) in table below. In the Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population, the 
majority of subjects (397, 65%) were in the <65 age group, 103 (17%) were in the 65 to <75 age group, 
84 subjects (14%) were in the 75 to <85 age group and 31 (5%) were ≥85 years old. There were no 
notable differences across the treatment arms with respect to the distribution of the age for the ITT-E 
population and Influenza Positive Population (IPP). Numbers are small but generally similar across 
treatment arms for the subgroups.

Clinical response rates and time to clinical response (TTCR) for subjects in the IPP are summarised by age 
in tables below.  
The proportion of subjects in the IPP who met the criteria for clinical response was similar across 
treatment groups for the 65 to <75, 75 to <85 and ≥85 years age groups. For the <65 years age group, 
the proportion of subjects who met the criteria for clinical response was 86% in the 300 mg IV zanamivir 
arm, 92% in the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm and 77% in the oseltamivir arm. Overall, the clinical response 
rate was higher in the younger age groups and decreased with increasing age, although numbers in the 
older age groups are small limiting interpretation of these results.

The median TTCR for each treatment arm and the median difference and associated 95% confidence 
interval between 600 mg IV zanamivir and the other two treatment arms were assessed by the bootstrap 
percentile method and are presented in table below for subjects in the <65, 65 to <75, 75 to <85 and ≥85 
years age groups. It should be noted that for subjects not achieving a clinical response, 99.9 days was 
assigned for TTCR as defined in the analysis plan. The TTCR was similar across treatment arms for 
subjects in the <65 and 65 to <75 years age groups. The TTCR was shorter in the oseltamivir arm 
compared with the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm for the 75 to <85 and ≥85 years age groups where TTCR was

more protracted in these older age groups however numbers are small, limiting interpretation of these 
results. The numerical differences and wide confidence intervals (CI) seen in the ≥85 years age group is 
likely driven by the small sample size and the relatively higher number of subjects in the 600 mg IV 
zanamivir arm who did not achieve clinical response and were assigned a TTCR of 99.9 days.

expected, the clinical response rates decreased and TTCR increased with increasing age. 
Influence of nausea /vomiting at baseline 
The presence and severity of a predefined list of influenza symptoms which included nausea and vomiting 
were assessed at baseline. In the Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population, nausea was present in 
24% of subjects and vomiting in 12% of subjects, overall the percentage of subjects with nausea and 
vomiting was the same for the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm and the oseltamivir arm.

In order to present the time to clinical response (TTCR) and clinical response rates for subjects who did 
not have nausea and vomiting symptoms at baseline, the following rule was applied: 
•  Subjects who had either nausea or vomiting at any severity level were classified as a ‘yes’ and 
subjects with a reported absence of both symptoms were classified as a ‘no’, also: 
•  One symptom is experienced at any severity level and the other is ‘unable to assess’: classified 
as ‘yes’  
•  One symptom is absent and the other is ‘unable to assess’: classified as ‘missing’ 
•  Both symptoms are ‘unable to assess’: classified as ‘missing’ 
The proportion of subjects in the Influenza Positive Population (IPP) without nausea and/or vomiting at 
baseline who met the criteria for clinical response was 90% in the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm compared 
with 76% in the oseltamivir arm and 88% in the 300 mg IV zanamivir arm. The proportion of subjects with 
nausea and/or vomiting at baseline who met the criteria for clinical response was similar between the 
treatment arms: 89% in the 300 mg IV zanamivir arm, 92% in the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm and 88% in 
the oseltamivir arm. 
The median TTCR for each treatment arm and the median difference and associated 95% confidence 
interval between 600 mg IV zanamivir and the other two treatment arms were assessed by the bootstrap 
percentile method and are presented below for subjects in the IPP with or without nausea and/or vomiting 
at baseline. It should be noted that for subjects not achieving a clinical response, 99.9 days was assigned 
for TTCR as defined in the analysis plan. The TTCR was similar across treatment arms for subjects with or 
without nausea and/or vomiting at baseline. Overall, TTCR was slightly longer in subjects without nausea 
and/or vomiting at baseline.

In summary, in the IPP only slightly more subjects in the oseltamivir arm had nausea and/or vomiting at 
baseline compared with the IV zanamivir arms. The presence or absence of these symptoms did not 
appear to significantly impact the clinical response rate or TTCR.

Mortality 
There were 41 deaths in the ITT-E population [15 (7%), 15 (7%) and 11 (5%)] in respective arms. 
Thirty-two subjects in the influenza positive population (IPP) [6%, 7% and 6% in the 300 mg IV 
zanamivir, 600 mg IV zanamivir and oseltamivir arms, respectively] died during the study. The number of 
deaths was similar across treatment groups. 
In the IPP, 18 subjects died on or before day 14 and 26 died on or before day 28. Median time to death 
was 16 days (range 10 to 39), 10 days (range 2 to 37) and 17 days (range 2 to 32) in respective 
treatment groups.  
Seventeen subjects in the IPP died due to complications of influenza (with complications determined as 
per investigator assessment), 3%, 4% and 4% in the 300 mg IV zanamivir, 600 mg IV zanamivir and 
oseltamivir arms, respectively.  Of those subjects, 11 (2% in each treatment arm) died on or before day 
14 and 15 (3% in each treatment arm) died on or before day 28. Median time to death was 14 days (range 
10 to 19), 7 days (range 2 to 37) and 12.5 days (range 2 to 32), respectively.

Non-inferiority assessed by attributable mortality was achieved for the comparison of 600 mg IV 
zanamivir against oseltamivir based on a non-inferiority margin of 5%. 
Functional status 
Based on the Katz ADL score 15% zanamivir and 20% oseltamivir IPP subjects did not return to 
pre-morbid functional status. The mean time to return to pre-morbid functional status was 5.7 days for 
300 mg IV zanamivir, 4.6 days for 600 mg IV zanamivir and 6.4 days for oseltamivir.  
Figure 5 
By the end of the study (PT+28), 26 subjects (6%) were still on bed rest while 49 (12%) reported limited 
ambulation and 344 (82%) were unrestricted. The level of activity was similar across treatment groups, 
with 86% and 83% subjects in the 300 mg and 600 mg IV zanamivir arms, respectively with unrestricted 
activity by end of study compared with 77% in the oseltamivir arm.  
Symptom duration /complications 
Due to the conditional nature of the data collected, the following assumptions were made to calculate the 
duration of symptoms: “unable to assess” at Day 1 assumed the symptom was not present and would not 
contribute the “number of days” but if a subject had an “unable to access” after Day 1, then the previous 
result was carried forward. Additionally, if there was a missed assessment, the previous result was carried 
forward. Overall, the incidence of influenza symptoms was similar across treatment groups but there 
were more subjects with sore throat in the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm (71% vs. 58% and 60%) and more 
with nausea and vomiting in the oseltamivir arm (nausea: 47% vs. 35% and 31%; vomiting: 28% vs. 
17% and 14%). 
Influenza complications identified by the investigator from AEs were recorded for 108 (22%) IPP subjects. 
The most common complications included respiratory disorders (10%) and infectious disorders (6%). 
Pneumonia was the commonest individual complication.  
Ventilatory support 
There were 80 (16%) subjects in the IPP on mechanical ventilation but none on ECMO at baseline. Most 
subjects in the IPP required ventilation or oxygenation support at some point during the study (21% 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 82/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
mechanical ventilation, 8% BiPAP, 4% CPAP and <1% ECMO). Ventilatory support and supplemental 
oxygen requirement was similar across treatment groups except that more subjects in the oseltamivir 
group received BiPAP compared with the IV zanamivir groups (14% vs. 5% and 6%). The median 
duration of mechanical ventilation (invasive and non-invasive combined) was 9.0, 5.2 and 8.2 days for 
the 300 mg IV zanamivir, 600 mg IV zanamivir and oseltamivir groups, respectively. The median duration 
of supplemental oxygen was 4.4, 4.2 and 3.7 days, respectively. 
The duration of hospitalization and ICU stay was similar across treatment arms.   
Viral load/ virological improvement 
For the population of subjects who were PCR positive at Baseline from NP swabs (N=410), the median 
time to virologic improvement for influenza A and B from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs was 3.0 days for all 
treatment arms.  Virological improvement was defined as a 2 log drop in viral load and the rate of success 
for those positive at baseline were 90% for Zanamivir hydrate IV 600 mg and 92% for oseltamivir 75 mg.

Among 55 subjects who were PCR positive from ET aspirates at baseline (N=55), the median time to 
virologic improvement was 2.5 days for 600 mg IV zanamivir arm vs. 4 days for the other arms. 
The median time to no detectable viral RNA as determined by qPCR for all subjects from NP swabs was 4 
days across all treatment groups. For the population of subjects who were culture positive at baseline in 
NP swabs (N=264), the median time to no detectable virus was 3.0 days across all treatment groups. 
The reductions in viral load were similar across treatment groups for influenza A and B combined (drops 
of 1.50, 1.83 and 1.75 log10 vp/mL by Day 3 for the 300 mg IV zanamivir, 600 mg IV zanamivir and 
oseltamivir arms, respectively). Similar reductions in viral load were seen across treatment groups for the 
influenza types/subtypes.  For subjects who were positive at baseline by qVC from NP swabs, the median 
change from baseline on Day 3 was - 2.01 log 10 TCID 50/mL for all treatment groups.  
Development of resistance 
In study NAI114373 238 Day 1 and 248 post Day 1 samples, a total of 502 cultured samples 
(nasopharyngeal) from 262 subjects (126 subjects with both Day 1 and post Day 1 samples) had 
sufficient viral titer for phenotypic analysis. Although many influenza A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2 and 
influenza B viruses showed shifts in susceptibility of >2 to Zanamivir, all were <10 and therefore within 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 83/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the normal range of inhibition. Influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses show normal levels of inhibition 
to oseltamivir (fold change <10). However, influenza A/H1N1pdm09 viruses demonstrate an elevated 
shift in susceptibility to oseltamivir as a result of the presence of the known resistance substitution, 
H275Y. From measurements of IC50 at baseline and during treatment, no strains were found to be 
resistant to zanamivir, while 5 samples were found to be resistant to oseltamivir. 
The H275Y substitution which is the most common oseltamivir resistance substitution was detected 
during treatment in four subjects (four immunocompetent patients and one immunocompromised) in the 
oseltamivir arm and conferred high level resistance to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to Zanamivir. A 
fifth subject (immunocompetent) in the 600 mg IV zanamivir arm harboured a H275Y at Baseline and a 
H275H/Y at Day 3, but had reverted to wildtype by Day 5. Subject 2475 had had 1 day of prior treatment 
with oseltamivir, which may have contributed to the selection of the H275Y substitution by Day 1. 
Two variants were identified in Day 2 samples from 2 subjects in the 300mg IV Zanamivir arm with 
potential resistance associated NA substitutions, N294N/S and T325I in H3N2 viruses. Both subjects with 
resistant genotypes were immunocompetent and had positive clinical responses. The viruses in this study 
could not be cultured so the effect on susceptibility could not be determined. To ascertain the effect of the 
NA substitutions N294S and T325I on susceptibility to zanamivir reverse genetics analysis was carried 
out.  Recombinant H3N2 virus with the N294S substitution was shown not to have an affect on 
susceptibility to zanamivir.  However, recombinant virus with the T325I substitution could not be cultured 
so its effect on susceptibility could not be determined.  The T325I substitution appears to reduce fitness 
of the virus which is a property commonly linked to resistance.  In conclusion the T325I substitution may 
confer zanamivir resistance, although conclusive data could not be obtained as the virus could not be 
cultured.    
No known zanamivir-associated resistance mutations developed in the 600 mg IV Zanamivir arm, 
demonstrating the high barrier to resistance of zanamivir.

Regarding the dose effect relationship the applicant claims that both 300 mg and 600 mg doses 
demonstrated a similar efficacy profile. The recommended dose of 600 mg was the maximum daily dose 
for use in clinical trials based on the nonclinical data. The obvious advantage of the higher dose is higher 
concentration of zanamivir in the target organs which means less chance of developing resistance and 
better effect against viral strains with reduced sensitivity towards zanamivir. Further justification for the 
selected dose has been presented by the applicant in response to question related to dose.

Supportive studies 
NAI113678 :  An Open-Label, Multi-Centre, Single Arm Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Tolerability of Intravenous Zanamivir hydrate in the Treatment of Hospitalized Adult, 
Adolescent and Paediatric Subjects with Confirmed Influenza Infection. 
This was an uncontrolled study in which IV zanamivir was administered twice daily for 5 days to 
hospitalized subjects with laboratory confirmed influenza (based on a positive RDT, antigen test, virus 
culture or RT-PCR). Treatment could be extended to 10 days if viral shedding was ongoing or if clinical 
symptoms warranted further treatment with IV zanamivir. 
Eligible subjects included adults, children, pregnant women, renally impaired and immunocompromised 
subjects. The permitted time from onset of symptoms to initiation of study medication was up to 7 days. 
The target enrolment was 200 subjects, to include ~150 adults/adolescents and ~50 paediatric subjects 
with an aim to enrol across the following age cohorts: 
• Cohort 1: 6 months to <1 year 
• Cohort 2: 1 year to <2 years 
• Cohort 3: 2 years to <6 years 
• Cohort 4: 6 years to <13 years 
• Cohort 5: ≥13 years 
The adult dose and adjustment schema were as reported in the Phase III study. The paediatric dose 
schema is shown below.

Exploratory analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between serum zanamivir PK to 
selected clinical, safety and virology endpoints.

The initial analysis was conducted with Pearson’s correlation analyses to examine the correlations 
between PK parameters (i.e. AUC and Cmax from initial dose and AUC, Cmax and Cmin from repeat dose) 
and selected clinical, safety, or virology endpoints for the initial and maintenance doses. If any of the 
endpoints showed a consistent association with PK parameters, additional logistic regression analysis was 
carried out for overall evaluation. 
Also in this study a separate virology report was included with assessment of viral susceptibility to 
zanamivir and presence of resistance substitutions that emerged during treatment. 
Results – Adults 
There were 130 adults enrolled of which 87 received ≤5 days and 43 received >5 days zanamivir. Of 23 
withdrawn from study, 20 were due to fatal AEs. Subjects were 57% male with median age 47.5 years 
(24% were ≥60 years). Three subjects were pregnant and one was immediately post-partum. Four were 
on CRRT, 2 were on intermittent haemodialysis and one was on intermittent peritoneal dialysis. 
At baseline, 60 (46%) were on mechanical ventilation and 3 were receiving ECMO. Another 46 subjects 
(35%) were receiving supplementary oxygen without mechanical ventilation.  
Most (104; 80%) had received prior oseltamivir/oseltamivir phosphate and 2 had prior inhaled zanamivir.  
The median duration of prior influenza antiviral treatment was 2 days (range 1 to 12 days). 
Using data from all available virology assays on all assessment days influenza subtype information was 
obtained from 125/130 subjects (96%) with A/H1N1pdm2009 in 71%, A/H3N2 in 12%, influenza A 
(subtype unknown) in 11%, and influenza B in 2%. The type/subtype was unknown in 4% of subjects.  
Median time to virologic improvement (2 log reduction in titres in nasopharyngeal swabs or sustained 
undetectable virus <2.7 log 10 copies/ml on two or more occasions using qPCR) was 3 days regardless of 
the final duration of treatment and was also 3 days for those who were PCR positive at baseline. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 89/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 39 
The median influenza A and B viral load by qPCR at baseline was 4.67 log10 copies/ml, and the median 
change was -0.75 log 10 copies/ml by Day 3. For those who were PCR positive at baseline (n=93), the 
median viral load was 5.34 log 10 copies/ml, and the median change was -1.42 log 10 copies/ml by Day 3. 
Although the sample size was small, median baseline qPCR viral load was higher for A/H3N2 vs. 
H1N1pdm09 (6.98 vs. 5.34 log 10 copies/ml, respectively).  
Subjects who started treatment <5 days after symptom onset had higher median virus titres at baseline 
compared with those who started treatment ≥5 days after symptom onset (5.11 vs. 3.89 log10 copies/ml, 
respectively) and the median decrease in viral load was greater if treatment was started within 5 days. 
The median time to no detectable viral RNA as determined by qPCR was 3 days. 
Using all the viral load data excluding any non-detectable samples there was no correlation between the 
qPCR and qVC assays for measuring viral load within nasopharyngeal swabs (Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient ρ=-0.012, p=0.88) or in endotracheal samples (Pearson’s correlation coefficient ρ=0.45, 
p=0.31).  
There were 26 deaths (20%) of which 17 (13%) occurred on or before day 14 and 22 (17%) on or before 
day 28. Median time to death was 10.5 days (range 1 to 44 days). Another 4 subjects died after day 28. 
Of those subjects who died due to complications of influenza (determined as per investigator 
assessment), 13 (10%) died on or before day 14 and 14 (11%) died on or before day 28 with a median 
time to death of 5 days (range 1 to 44 days). 
Overall, 81 subjects (62%) contributed to the time to clinical response composite endpoint, while 49 
(38%) never reached success criteria. The median time to clinical response was 9 days (range 2 to 32 
days). The median time to return to normal criteria for each individual vital sign contributing to the 
composite clinical response endpoint was between 2 and 8 days.  
The median duration of hospitalisation was 15 days (range 1 to 133 days) and 108 (83%) had a stay in 
ICU with a median duration of 11.5 days (range 1 to 104 days; including possibly days in ICU before entry 
into the study). Excluding subjects who died the median duration of hospitalisation was 19 days (range 2 
to 133 days). 
There were 100 subjects (77%) with a discharge date recorded. The median time to discharge was 16 
days (2 to 133 days).  
Stepwise logistic regression showed that H3N2 subtype, Hispanic ethnicity and delayed time to treatment 
with zanamivir were significant risk factors associated with mortality (p<0.05) whereas age was 
marginally significant (p=0.078). Therefore, the adjusted OR of 4.516 indicates that the odds of death are 
4.516 times higher for subjects with H3N2 subtype than those without. Each single day delay in start of 
treatment increased the odds of death by 40%, and every 10 years increase in age increased the odds of 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 90/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
death by 37%. Multivariate Cox regression with stepwise selection method on time to mortality also 
confirmed the findings of the logistic regression. 
Results – Paediatrics (<18 years) 
Of 73 paediatric subjects enrolled into age cohorts shown below, 71 received zanamivir. 
Table 40 
All 5 subjects who withdrew due to an AE died. Overall 61% received at least 5 days of treatment and 25 
were prematurely withdrawn from zanamivir at investigators’ discretion. Most (66%) were male, the 
median age was 7 years and 40 had at least one chronic underlying medical condition, including 9 
immunocompromised subjects. Most subjects were confirmed to be influenza positive by rapid test for 
Influenza A or B (48%) or PCR (41%). Also, 34/58 subjects (59%) who had a chest X-ray at Baseline had 
an infiltrate present, 24 (34%) were on mechanical ventilation at baseline and another 4 were receiving 
ECMO while 12 were receiving supplementary oxygen but were not ventilated. 
Most (50; 70%) had received influenza specific therapies before study entry and 49 had received prior 
oseltamivir with a median duration of prior treatment of 2 days (range 1 to 11 days).  
Using results from all available virology samples and assays on all assessment days virus subtype 
information was obtained from 70/71 treated subjects. A/H3N2 and influenza B were reported in 25 
subjects each, A/ H1N1pdm2009 in 12 and influenza A (subtype unknown) in 7. One subject was 
co-infected with A/H3N2 and B and the type/subtype was unknown in another subject.  
For the total population, the median time to virologic improvement was 3 days (range 1 to 25 days) with 
no appreciable difference among the age cohorts (range 3 to 4 days). For the population who were PCR 
positive at baseline the median time to virologic improvement was 4.0 days with no appreciable difference 
among the age cohorts.

Virologic improvement occurred sooner for subjects infected with influenza A/H3N2 than with 
A/H1N1pdm09 or B.  
Among 55/71 (77%) subjects with NP samples that were positive at baseline by qPCR, the median viral 
load at baseline was 6.66 log 10  copies/mL and the median change viral load from baseline was -1.81 log 10 
copies/mL by day 3 and -2.94 log 10 copies/mL at day 5. In this subset, the median baseline qPCR viral 
load was highest in subjects with influenza B followed by A/H1N1pdm09 and then A/H3N2 (7.17, 6.76, 
and 5.90 log 10 copies/mL, respectively). The change in viral load at Day 3 was greatest for H3N2.  
Subjects who started treatment <5 days after symptom onset had higher median virus titres at baseline 
compared with those who started treatment ≥5 days after symptom onset (6.25 vs. 5.665 log 10 
copies/ml, respectively). The median decrease in viral load was greater if treatment was started <5 days 
from symptom onset. 
For the population who were virus culture positive, the median viral load at baseline by qVC was 3.0 log 10 
TCID 50/ml and the median change in viral load from baseline was -1.76 log10 TCID 50/ml by day 3. 
Overall, the median time to no detectable viral RNA as determined by qPCR was 4 days and the median 
time to no detectable virus as determined by qVC was 3 days.   
For the 9 subjects classified as immunocompromised the median time to virologic improvement was 5 
days and 44% achieved undetectable viral RNA compared to 62% in the ITT-E population although the 
median time to no detectable viral RNA was slightly shorter 
Three of the 5 subjects who died did so on or before day - 14. Median time to death was 12 days (range 
6 to 25 days).   
Among 24 subjects on mechanical ventilation there were 13 still receiving this treatment by day 5 and 3 
by the end of the study (post treatment +23 days).  
Clinical response was achieved in 65 subjects (92%) with a median time of 6 days (range 1 to 42 days).  
The median duration of hospitalisation was 6 days (range 1 to 45 days) and the median duration ICU stay 
was 7.5 days (range 2 to 50 days).  For 65 subjects (92 %) with a discharge date recorded the median 
time to discharge was 6.0 days (1 to 45 days).   
The median time to return to pre-morbid functional status was 5.0 days for the overall population, but 
ranged from 3.0 days for cohort 2 to 8.0 days for cohort 1.

Resistance 
In study NAI113678 adults a low number of 50 throat samples out of 612 were phenotyped. The mean 
IC50s for the influenza A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses were 0.20 ± 0.06 nM, 0.26 ± 
0.07 nM and 1.61 ± 0.35 nM respectively, were within the ranges previously observed. The role of the HA 
mutations observed in this study in susceptibility to Zanamivir is not clear. Two resistance associated HA 
mutations, S162N and Q223R in influenza A/H1N1pdm09 viruses from two subjects emerged during 
treatment with Zanamivir. There is no clear evidence of treatment emergent NA resistance mutations. 
In study NAI113678 children relatively few viruses were subjected to phenotypic analysis. Out of 
approximately 90 Day 1, and 200 post Day 1 samples, a total of 48 cultured samples from 35 subjects had 
sufficient viral titer for phenotypic analysis. Neither mean IC50 nor IC90 values increased during 
treatment. One immunocompetent subject (a 9 month old infant) had a treatment emergent substitution 
E119G in the NA gene on day 5 of treatment. This substitution is known to confer resistance to NAIs, 
however no phenotypic data were available for this subject. The subject had received oseltamivir for 3 
days prior to enrolling in the study.  One subject harboured the H275Y NA substitution at baseline, which 
may have been selected during 2 days of prior oseltamivir treatment. One subject harboured a treatment 
emergent HA resistance substitution but the effect on susceptibility could not be determined. 
NAI115215 
This was a small uncontrolled Japanese study that enrolled 21 adults (≥16 years of age; 20 confirmed 
influenza) hospitalised with influenza who were treated with 600 mg IV BID.  
The primary objective was safety, but a number of clinical and virology endpoints, similar to study 
NAI114373 were reported. 
The following efficacy endpoints were evaluated as secondary endpoint: 
Time to absence of fever, time to improved respiratory status, oxygen saturation, heart rate and 
systolic blood pressure, time to clinical response (TTCR same as NAI114373), time to return to 
pre-morbid level of activity, incidence and duration of clinical symptoms of influenza, incidence of 
complications of influenza and associated antibiotic use, ventilation status, length of ICU and 
hospital stays. 
The median time to absence of fever was 24.9 hours (range 9.5 to 82.3) and the median time to clinical 
response was 85 hours (range 12.7 to 530 hours; n=20). The median time to return to pre-morbid level 
of activity as measured by the 3-point scale was 87.6 hours (range 21 to 714 hours; n=16). No subject 
had a stay in ICU at any point during the study. 
The median time to virologic improvement was 3.0 days (range 2 to 5 days, n=19), the median time to 
no detectable viral RNA by quantitative RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal samples was 5.5 days (range 4 to 
7 days; n=10) and the value based on quantitative viral culture was 3.0 days (range 2 to 4 days; n=17). 
For those with A/H3N2, the median viral load by qPCR at baseline was 8.92 log10 copies/ml with median 
changes on days 3 and 5 that were -2.74 and -3.73 log 10 copies/mL. 
CUP REL113375  
As of 31 January 2017, the CUP for zanamivir aqueous solution supplied treatment to 3063 seriously ill 
hospitalised patients with influenza for which suitable approved alternative anti-viral treatment was 
unavailable, inappropriate or ineffective.  Among the 783 patients with a CRF, most (76%) had underlying

medical conditions and 73% required mechanical ventilation, with 21% receiving ECMO. In this group of 
783 patients the physicians considered the clinical outcome for 30% to be recovered or resolved, 37% not 
recovered or resolved and 26% fatal. Emerging signs of impairment of function or significant toxicities 
were noted most frequently for the renal (11%), hepatic (10%) and cardiovascular systems (10%). 
NAI115008 – CUP retrospective chart review 
With >1000 patients treated globally in the CUP up to 31 January 2011, this global retrospective chart 
review was used to obtain details on a subset. Tier 1 consisted of paediatric and pregnant/postpartum 
patients (1-14 days post-delivery) and Tier 2 cohort consisted of non-pregnant adults treated at Tier 1 
centres. The review included 113 patients from 34 sites in 12 countries of which 8 were pregnant at 
hospital admission (4 second and 4 third trimester) and 3 were postpartum. 
The physician was responsible for reviewing the patient’s medical record and completing the CRF. The 
following data were collected: 
Length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, underlying medical conditions, influenza 
history, oxygenation/ventilation, zanamivir treatment course, selected concomitant medications, clinical 
course/outcome, complications of influenza, all deaths. 
Exploratory statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship of the outcome 
(survival/death) and various factors including: gender, race, age, time from illness onset to initiation of 
antiviral therapy, and time from illness onset to hospital admission.  
All patients had a diagnostic test for influenza and influenza A H1N1 2009 was the most common influenza 
sub-type identified. Among 12 paediatric patients with data, resistance was detected in 4 
(H275Ysubstitution). Among 18 adult patients with data, resistance was detected in 4 (2 with an influenza 
H275Y variant and 2 with an E274 variant).  
More than 80% of paediatric and adult patients received oseltamivir therapy during the hospitalisation 
period in which they received zanamivir aqueous solution. The route of zanamivir aqueous solution 
administration for the majority of paediatric (92%) and adult (76%) patients was IV and the median 
number of IV doses was 10 (range 1 to 37). The median time from hospitalisation to initiation of IV 
zanamivir was 4 days.  
Overall, 34 paediatric patients (68%) were considered recovered or recovering at the time of their 
hospital discharge while 16 (32%) died (15 in the hospital and 1 after discharge).  Also, 32 adult patients 
(51%) were considered recovered or recovering at the time of hospital discharge while 27 (43%) died (24 
in the hospital and 3 after discharge).

Virology 
Several correlations of virological and clinical responses were investigated in the Phase II and Phase III 
zanamivir studies NAI113678 and NAI114373. Correlations between Pharmacokinetic (PK)/ 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters and virology and clinical responses were explored. 
A statistically significant correlation between time to clinical response (TTCR) and the reduction in viral 
load as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on day 3 was identified in 
NAI114373: Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.1380, p-value = 0.0123. Other correlations could not be 
identified. Patients hospitalised with influenza often have an immunological features of disease 
progression and although they respond to antiviral treatment do not necessarily respond clinically.

Of the 28 outliers that had time to No Quantitative PCR and time to Sustained Virological Improvement of 
greater than 20 days, none had any resistance associated substitutions and only one subject in 
NAI114373 showed a fold shift in susceptibility of 6.16 (influenza A/H3N2) relative to a reference strain, 
which is within the normal range of inhibition categorised by the World Health Organisation. The clinical 
status of these outliers reflects the overall study populations, 71% of which had underlying medical 
conditions and 7% were immunocompromised. Although these 28 outliers had longer time to virological 
response, the majority (86%) responded clinically.  
In conclusion, the 28 outliers did not have any single virological or clinical parameter there may account 
for lack of a virological response. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Zanamivir IV has been tested in clinical studies in age groups from 6 months to elderly and in patients 
with underlying diseases including immunosuppressed subjects.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Based on the design of the above studies, it is only the main study NAI114373 with an active control arm 
that has the potential to appropriately evaluate efficacy.  The use of oseltamivir, considered a standard 
treatment, as a control was according to scientific advice.  Indeed, the comparator was 75 mg oral 
oseltamivir, which is being used extensively for treatment of uncomplicated influenza as well as in 
patients hospitalised for severe, complicated influenza. Although there are no efficacy data from 
randomised, placebo-controlled trials in hospitalised influenza patients, oseltamivir has been 
recommended and used for many years. Use of placebo control is considered unethical for this patient 
group, therefore the use of oseltamivir as an active comparator is supported. The limitation by using this 
comparator is that no claim of efficacy can be made unless superiority is demonstrated. The extensive use 
of oseltamivir is based on efficacy shown for uncomplicated influenza in outpatients, the effect on viral 
load and case reports and retrospective studies in hospitalised influenza patients. 
The patient population enrolled met criteria that would be widely regarded as defining a population 
considered to have complicated influenza. There was stratification at randomisation based on time from 
onset of symptoms to initiation of treatment (≤4 days and 5 to 6 days; 6 days was the maximum 
allowed). The SmPC has been revised and it is now stated that treatment with Dectova should commence 
as soon as possible and usually within 6 days of the onset of symptoms of influenza. 
With a mean and median duration of treatment ~6 days in each group, some subjects had their treatment 
extended according to protocol.  Only 12% of patients (11-13% across treatment groups) received more 
than 5 days treatment.  
For NAI114373, the primary endpoint was the time to clinical response (TTCR) in subjects with confirmed 
influenza. Clinical response was defined as resolution of at least 4 of the 5 signs within the respective 
resolution criteria, maintained for at least 24 hours, or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. The 
5 responses were: fever AND oxygen saturation AND 2 out of 3, including respiratory status, hearth rate 
and systolic blood pressure. The same endpoints have been used for hospitalised influenza patients for 
other anti-influenza drugs. 
A large number of secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed: 
The combined analysis of TTCR and time to improvement in Respiratory Status, mortality rate, functional 
status (change from baseline, time and proportion that return to baseline), incidence and duration of 
clinical symptoms of influenza, complications and antibiotic use, ventilation status, length of ICU and 
hospital stays, time to absence of fever, time to improved respiratory status, oxygen saturation, heart 
rate and systolic blood pressure. 
Virology endpoints are also relevant for efficacy and both viral load and the presence of resistant strains 
were thoroughly measured and reported.  A separate virology report was included with assessment of 
viral susceptibility to zanamivir at baseline and throughout treatment by NA and HA sequence analysis 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 98/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and NA enzyme inhibition assay, frequency of resistance substitutions that emerged during treatment and 
the presence and frequency of minority species with resistance substitutions.

Time to virologic improvement, defined as a 2 log drop in viral load or sustained undetectable viral

Day 8, Day 10 and/or last day of randomized treatment.

PK was also part of the study. However, due to sparse PK sampling (one end-of-infusion sample on Day 
1 and a pre-dose, end-of-infusion and post-dose sample on Day 4) calculation of AUC was not planned for 
PK analysis. 
Only study NAI114373 had efficacy as primary endpoint.  The main controlled study NAI114373 and the 
two supportive studies NAI 113678 and NAI115215 were all adequate regarding methods, conducting, 
analysis and reporting. The large number of secondary endpoints related to clinical outcome and virology 
data for all three studies gave detailed and valuable information.  The large variability in the patient 
populations regarding age, underlying disease, time to treatment, progress and severity of influenza 
disease influence the precision of the endpoints. On the other hand, the variability may gain insight into 
what factors that have the largest impact on disease progression. Statistical analysis of factors affecting 
endpoints was conducted and reported for studies NAI113678 and NAI115008 Compassionate use. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal trial NAI114373, the median time-to-clinical-response in days was not statistically 
different for IV zanamivir 600 mg and oseltamivir 75 mg.  That relates to the total influenza positive 
population and the subgroups: ICU/mechanical ventilation and symptom onset ≤ 4 days, which were part 
of the primary endpoint analysis. Thus, the study failed the primary goal of demonstrating superiority of 
zanamivir 600 mg IV over oseltamivir 75 mg. Also, post-hoc analysis showed that for the subgroups: 
symptom onset > 4 days, female and male, there were no significant differences between treatments. 
The median time to clinical response was 0.48 days shorter for IV zanamivir 600 mg compared to 
oseltamivir 75 mg. There was a large non-significant difference in favour of IV zanamivir  in the subgroup 
symptom onset > 4 days, time to clinical response was 9.8 days for zanamivir 600 mg IV and 19 days for 
oseltamivir 75 mg (p value 0.178). 
A comparison of outcomes for subgroups with up to or more than 5 days treatment is limited by the 
smaller numbers in the latter subset. Nevertheless, as expected, the clinical response rates were lower 
and median TTCRs longer in the latter subset. This finding applied across the three treatment groups and 
there was no disadvantage for zanamivir. 
The indication applied for has a patient population limited by: 1) when circulation strains are resistant to 
approved anti-influenza medications and/or 2) cannot take medicines by other route than IV. The 
indication represents a patient population where zanamivir IV has a potential to be superior to other 
influenza therapies. However, none of the potential advantages of IV zanamivir was demonstrated in the 
comparative study or in other studies. Firstly, the inclusion criteria in study NAI114373 included the 
ability of patients to take oral capsules (randomised to oral oseltamivir) and secondly the circulation of 
oseltamivir-resistant virus was very low in the study period. Thus, the potential superiority of IV 
zanamivir over oral oseltamivir for the limited patient population according to the proposed indication 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 99/143 
 
 
  
  
could not be demonstrated. The one thing that was demonstrated was that IV zanamivir and oral 
oseltamivir had similar clinical and virology outcomes for the selected patient population. 
When the superiority analysis against oral oseltamivir failed, and there are no randomised studies to 
compare oseltamivir with placebo for hospitalised patients with complicated influenza, there is no direct 
proof of efficacy of zanamivir in this population of hospitalised influenza patients.  
A positive side of the clinical data, however, pertains to the fact that the patients represent a wide 
spectrum of severity of disease, age groups, underlying diseases and influenza strains. Both the 
pandemic H1N1pdm09 and seasonal H3N2 strains are well represented in the data, with a smaller fraction 
of influenza B.  In some of the studies high mortality due to influenza was reported. The large and detailed 
patient data material was analysed for risk factors of importance for clinical outcome.  Clearly, the time 
from symptom onset to treatment was one of the important factors. The applicant has performed an 
analysis of the effect of delayed start of treatment with zanamivir controlling for the prior use of 
oseltamivir. The data show that there is a large positive effect of early start of treatment (≤4 days) 
compared to delayed treatment (> 4 days), regardless of prior treatment with oseltamivir.  The patients 
receiving prior treatment with oseltamivir had slower response rate compared to those who did not 
receive oseltamivir prior to treatment, which could be due to differences in disease severity. In the pivotal 
study about half of all subjects had received oseltamivir for a median of 2 days before study entry but they 
still met the entry criteria. Clinical response rates were higher in those with no prior oseltamivir use, but 
this observation applied across the three treatments, with preservation of numerical superiority for 
zanamivir, suggesting that it was not oseltamivir use per se that was impacting the treatment effect but 
likely an issue related to duration of illness at the time of enrolment.  Median TTCR results overall are in 
keeping with clinical responses since those who had received pre-study oseltamivir took longer to respond 
in each treatment group. When comparing the proposed zanamivir dose (600 mg BID) with oseltamivir, 
TTCR values were slightly longer for oseltamivir regardless of prior treatment. However, in those without 
prior oseltamivir usage the TTCR was slightly longer for 300 mg BID IV vs. the oseltamivir group. The 
results suggest that the proposed dose performs at least as well as oseltamivir regardless of prior 
oseltamivir treatment. Furthermore, the revised indication would direct usage towards those who likely 
already received and failed oseltamivir.    
The breakdown of clinical response rates and TTCR in subsets with and without nausea and/or vomiting at 
baseline, do not indicate that having one or both symptoms had a negative impact on the responses to 
oseltamivir. Therefore, the concern that the presence of these symptoms might have favoured IV 
zanamivir over oral oseltamivir has been addressed. 
The following subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint TTCR were performed: 
1) Influenza A versus influenza B  
2) start with treatment ≤ 48 hours after onset of disease versus start with treatment > 48 hours 
after onset of disease. 
Clinical response rates were similar cross subgroups influenza A and B. The TTCR was slightly longer in 
the symptom onset > 2 days subgroup compared with the symptom onset ≤ 2 days subgroup. 
The applicant has provided the breakdown of clinical response rates and TTCR values by age sub-group. 
It is agreed that the results within subgroups should be interpreted with some caution. For the most part 
there is no disadvantage for zanamivir (both or at least one dose group) compared to oseltamivir. It does 
appear that the fewer subjects aged ≥85 years were least likely to do well, but this observation applies 
across treatments. Overall, considering the limitations of the numbers in the oldest categories, there are 
no specific concerns raised by the findings by age sub-group.   
Regarding the dose effect relationship the applicant claims that both 300 mg and 600 mg doses 
demonstrated a similar efficacy profile.  The recommended dose of 600 mg was the maximum daily dose

Page 100/143 
 
 
  
  
for use in clinical trials based on the nonclinical data. The obvious advantage of the higher dose is higher 
concentration of zanamivir in the target organs, which means less chance of developing resistance and 
better effect against viral strains with reduced sensitivity towards Zanamivir.  The applicant has 
adequately justified the dose of 600 mg. 
In study NAI113678 the results from stepwise logistic regression identified four important risk factors 
for mortality. H3N2 subtype, Hispanic ethnicity, and delayed time to treatment with Zanamivir were 
significant risk factors associated with mortality (p<0.05); whereas age was marginally significant 
(p=0.078). Each single day delay in start of treatment increased the odds of death by 40%, and every 10 
years increase in age increased the odds of death by 37%. The small numbers in the Hispanic ethnic 
group precludes any reliable conclusions on the effect on increased risk of mortality. It was not 
unexpected that more older subjects were infected with H3N2 than H1N1pdm09 strains and had a higher 
risk of adverse influenza outcomes. There were insufficient numbers to assess the interaction term in the 
model between A/H3N2 and age. However, the median age of influenza A/H3N2 infected subjects was 
higher than the median age of all other subjects, Factors found not to be strongly associated (p > 0.1) 
with mortality in this exploratory analysis included: duration of treatment, gender, pre-study antiviral 
use, immunomodulator use, BMI, and Baseline qPCR viral load. No consistent statistically significant 
correlations were identified between PK parameters and virology endpoints. 
The number of paediatric patients in study NAI113678 in each age interval is small: n=7 (6m to< 1y), 
n=11 (1 to<2y), n=12 (2 <6y), n=27 (6 to<13y), n=14 (13 to<18y).  A comparison with the adult 
population in the same study is difficult because the adults were exposed to the pandemic H1N1pdm09 
strain when it was introduced and experienced high mortality and more severe disease compared to the 
children.  The higher frequency of clinical response among the children is probably due to different study 
period resulting in exposure to different influenza strains with variable virulence. There is no indication of 
large differences in clinical outcome comparing data from children and adults. 
In the Compassionate use programme study NAI15008 exploratory statistical analyses were performed 
to assess the relationship of the outcome and various factors such as gender, race, age time from illness 
onset to initiation of therapy. The analyses were limited by small sample size. The only significant factor 
was time from symptom onset to first zanamivir administration, which may potentially have had impact 
on survival in adult and pregnant patients. 
Viral load 
Study NAI114373 is discussed, but the results from study NAI113678 Adults and children are 
comparable. The majority of patients experienced a clearance of virus within 3 days after start of 
treatment with no detectable viral RNA and no virus detected by culture.  The range in time to no 
detectable virus is large (1-36 days) and many patient lack post treatment measurements. 
At baseline the number of virology samples are n=156, while the numbers measured post treatment are 
less than half (n=73 and 58 at days post treatment +28 and +5, respectively).  One out of 73 patients is 
positive at post treatment + 28 days. The median time to success of 3.0 days is satisfactory. However, the 
mean days to success being 6.7, the standard deviation 8.86 and the maximum number of days being 35, 
indicate that a large proportion of patients used a long time to clear the virus. 
No single factor could characterise the patients that had more than 20 days to sustained virological 
improvement and no quantitative PCR detection, but a majority (86%) of them achieved clinical success. 
Resistance 
Across studies, 10 subjects in studies NAI113678 and NIA114373 had oseltamivir NA resistance 
substitutions.  Seven patients fully recovered, two failed to respond and one died on the study. Six 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 101/143 
 
 
  
  
 
subjects showed a reduction in viral load and four did not show a virological response. None of the viruses 
isolated from these subjects showed a >5-fold change in susceptibility to zanamivir. The presence of 
oseltamivir resistant virus did not seem to affect the clinical outcome of the subjects treated with IV 
zanamivir. 
There have been nine case reports in the scientific literature of treatment emergent resistant viruses with 
known resistance substitutions isolated from immunocompromised patients who received IV Zanamivir 
via the CUP and one from an immunocompromised adult from study NAI113678 (E119D), who died on the 
study. Influenza infections in immunocompromised patients have been shown to have prolonged viral 
replication despite antiviral therapy, and therefore an increased risk of antiviral resistance emergence 
and persistent illness. 
Treatment-emergent resistance to zanamivir is rare and is more commonly reported in 
immunocompromised patients (see detailed in “Pharmacology” section). There are 10 recorded cases of 
treatment-emergent zanamivir resistance in immunocompromised subjects, one from the IV zanamivir 
study NAI113678, one following treatment with nebulised zanamivir and two from inhaled zanamivir, 
reported in the literature, and six from the IV zanamivir Compassionate Use Programme. The clinical 
outcome was 9 deaths and one survived. The SPC, section 4.4, has been updated with a warning 
regarding a higher possibility of development of resistance in immunocompromised and the importance to 
monitoring resistance. 
Additional expert consultation 
A Scientific Advisory group (SAG) meeting was organised to address the following concerns: 
1.  The strength of  available evidence to support the efficacy of NAIs in complicated 
influenza, and the extent to which data generated with other NAI’s can be 
extrapolated to i.v. zanamivir 
It was acknowledged by the SAG that reviews of the available data on the clinical efficacy of NAIs in the 
treatment of complicated influenza by public health agencies, independent scientific review panels, and 
professional bodies have resulted in widespread recommendations to use NAIs in this patient group.  
The SAG discussed the available evidence in support of the efficacy of NAIs in complicated and potentially 
life-threatening influenza and concluded that although the body of evidence is weak, relying on 
observational studies and meta-analyses, it is nevertheless consistent with a clinical benefit.  
However, the group noted that the available evidence on the efficacy of NAIs in complicated and 
potentially life-threatening influenza is particularly weak in the paediatric population and identified this as 
a research priority. The group also raised the issue that the lack of definitions for ‘complicated’ and ‘life 
threatening’ influenza further complicates interpretation of data and implementation of guidelines.  
The SAG considered whether it was reasonable to extrapolate data generated with other NAIs to IV 
zanamivir. The SAG were in agreement that, given what is known about the mechanism of action, 
comparable data from in vitro and in vivo studies, and studies in uncomplicated influenza, relevant data 
generated with other NAI’s could be reasonably extrapolated to IV zanamivir.   
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 102/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
2.  The expectation of clinical benefit for i.v. zanamivir when used in complicated 
influenza given available in-vitro and in-vivo data for inhaled and i.v. zanamivir 
In the pivotal Phase III study, IV zanamivir failed to meet the primary endpoint of superiority in time to 
clinical response, showing similar clinical and virologic outcomes compared to oseltamivir.  
Whilst evidence of efficacy has not been demonstrated in prospective randomised controlled trials in the 
treatment of complicated influenza, the SAG concluded that an expectation of clinical benefit can be 
derived based on the totality of the available evidence on NAIs and the development programmes for 
inhaled and IV zanamivir. 
The SAG agreed that in vitro/ in vivo data obtained for inhaled and IV zanamivir provide a reasonable 
expectation of clinical benefit when used in complicated influenza. 
3.  The safety profile of i.v. zanamivir 
The safety profile of IV zanamivir has been determined in influenza patients with a range of comorbidities 
and co-medications, which would be reflective of the real-world population of complicated influenza. 
Considering the data seen by the experts and notwithstanding possible limitations in the size of the study 
population, the Group expressed the view that the safety profile of IV zanamivir is likely to be acceptable. 
4.  Zanamivir’s place in therapy if it was approved. 
The SAG considered the medical need for IV zanamivir and the proposed indication in the application to 
EMA.  
The SAG members were in agreement that there is an unmet medical need for IV zanamivir. Primarily, IV 
zanamivir would offer a parenteral option to critically ill patients and others with complicated and 
potentially life-threatening influenza in whom NAI treatment is recommended but who are unable to 
receive oral or inhaled NAIs. In addition, zanamivir has a different resistance profile to other NAIs and IV 
zanamivir would be of value in patients infected with oseltamivir/peramivir resistant influenza strains who 
are unable to receive treatment with inhaled zanamivir.  
The proposed indication would limit the use of IV zanamivir to second-line or “last-resort” treatment in 
most circumstances. 
The experts were in agreement with the indication as proposed, which clearly covers the group of patients 
who may benefit from the therapeutic intervention.  No extra restrictions, neither further widening of the 
indication was recommended 
5.  Whether and which other meaningful data could be collected to further support 
efficacy of zanamivir i.v. in complicated influenza. 
The applicant had proposed the following measures: 
  Post-authorisation effectiveness study (PAES) 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 103/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Post-authorisation European Pregnancy Registry  
  Neonatal study (0-6 months of age) as part of Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
The SAG extensively discussed the proposed measures and expressed the need for more robust data 
collection in order to further substantiate the effectiveness of IV Zanamivir. The retrospective chart 
review effectiveness study was not considered fully satisfactory since there are uncertainties regarding 
data completeness and quality when making use of medical records alone. This could potentially 
challenge reliable adjustment for confounding factors. The SAG were also unclear about the comparator 
group, and highlighted the importance of concurrent controls given that influenza severity and resistance 
profiles change over time. 
Also, the SAG expressed a concern that the available information may not be adequate to inform the 
correct use of IV zanamivir in some select sub-group of patients, such as patients on renal replacement 
therapy or ECMO. It was acknowledged that it may be difficult to obtain adequate comparative clinical 
data in these subgroups but the SAG felt it would be desirable to supplement the clinical data with PK/PD 
data in these subgroups to properly inform the clinical use of IV zanamivir. 
The SAG supported the proposed Post-authorisation European Pregnancy Registry and the neonatal 
study. 
Following the SAG, the indication was further narrowed following comments raised by the CHMP, and the 
Applicant submitted a revised SmPC addressing these concerns. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
The following measures have been agreed with the CHMP: 
The applicant commits to a retrospective observational chart review study to evaluate the clinical 
effectiveness of treatment with zanamivir 10 mg/ml solution for infusion in a cohort of ICU-treated 
patients with complicated influenza. A detailed protocol has been submitted and the study is to be 
initiated soon after obtaining the MA.  
In addition, a prospective observational study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of treatment with 
zanamivir 10 mg/ml solution for infusion in patients with complicated influenza infection if and when 
specific conditions are met which may lead to an increase usage of IV zanamivir, is agreed.  Examples of 
such conditions being when European Public Health Clinical Practice Guidelines for the treatment of 
influenza recommend the early or first line use of IV zanamivir, such as during a severe influenza 
pandemic or when there is influenza known to be resistant to other antivirals than zanamivir widely 
circulating in the European Union as reported by the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human 
Influenza (ERLI-Net).  The applicant envisages Scientific Advice regarding the design and criteria for 
initiation of the prospective study.   
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The comparative study in hospitalised influenza patients showed that 600 mg IV zanamivir and 75 mg oral 
oseltamivir have similar results regarding clinical and virology endpoints. As there is no data on 
oseltamivir compared to placebo in hospitalised influenza patients from randomised clinical trials there is 
no definite demonstration of efficacy.  
The indication is limited to patients infected with influenza virus strains that are resistant to approved 
therapies or who are unable to receive therapy through other routes than IV administration. The potential 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 104/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
benefit of zanamivir IV to the limited patient population was not demonstrated in the studies due to lack 
of circulating strains resistant to oseltamivir. Nevertheless, zanamivir has in vitro activity against viruses 
with the most common mechanisms of resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir. In a human challenge 
study (though preventative setting), the proposed dose clearly showed virological and clinical effects.  
Oseltamivir is widely used to treat complicated influenza even though data are lacking to unequivocally 
demonstrate its benefit. If oseltamivir-resistant virus emerges to a considerable extent having an IV 
preparation of zanamivir available for use would be expected efficacious. In cases of resistance to 
oseltamivir or peramivir, there would be a lack of alternative therapies and considering the severity of the 
potential life-threatening disease, the rationale of a medical need for IV zanamivir can be agreed. This is 
supported by the fact that approximately 3000 patients have been treated in the Compassionate use 
programme (CUP). 
Compared to CUP, the use of IV zanamivir based on a Marketing Authorisation (under exceptional 
circumstances) is favourable in that more systematic collection of data from use will be generated 
through Risk Management Plan and Periodic Safety Updates. Furthermore, two specific obligations related 
to collect further data on effectiveness are agreed.  
The applicant has presented a review of the current public health recommendations for use of NAIs in 
complicated influenza and the clinical data that support the recommendations.  Recent review of the 
public health recommendations included studies by Cochrane, studies from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and 
others.  
The public health guidelines from Europe and globally, as well as recent reviews on clinical data, support 
current recommendations. Guidelines from USA, England WHO, ECDC, Japan and Australia have been 
presented.  NAIs are generally recommended for use against severe influenza. According to ECDC there 
are 21 countries in EU/EEA that have national recommendations regarding influenza antiviral use for 
patients with severe or progressive influenza requiring hospitalisation.  Antiviral agents are also 
recommended for outpatients who are at risk of influenza complications. 
The recent confirmation of the public health recommendations [ECDC, 2017] about the use of NAIs 
together with the fact that 3000 patients have received IV zanamivir in compassionate use programme, 
demonstrates the medical need involved. It is unfortunate that the absolute efficacy of NAIs in the 
treatment of complicated influenza has not been determined in RCTs against placebo, and probably never 
will due to the inherent difficulties involved. However, in spite of that, it is a fact that NAIs have for a long 
time been used as a standard of care in hospitals and there are data from different sources to support the 
recommendation and use.   
Regarding justification for the dose regimen, the selection of 600 mg IV BID for 5-10 days can be 
accepted.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
1. A retrospective observational chart review study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of treatment with 
zanamivir 10mg/ml solution for infusion in a cohort of intensive care unit-treated (ICU) patients with 
complicated influenza infection 
2. A prospective, observational effectiveness study of IV zanamivir in patients with complicated influenza

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical safety is based on 201 subjects exposed in phase I studies, 643 patients treated in clinical 
trials phase II and III and 3176 patients treated in the Compassionate Use Programme (3063 from CUP 
+ 113 from a chart review within the CUP programme). One of the supportive studies (phase II 
NAI113678, incl. both children and adults) was performed during the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic 
2009/2010. Both studies in the Compassionate Use Programme included patients treated during the 
influenza A/H1N1 pandemic 2009/2010. 
In the pivotal study (NAI114373) the safety of zanamivir IV could be compared to safety of oseltamivir 
treatment. 
Safety is evaluated in both children and adults: 
Table 47 
In the clinical trials phase II and III zanamivir IV were administered 300mg BID or 600mg BID. 
In the compassionate use programme patients were either administered IV zanamivir 600 mg or 
nebulized zanamivir 25 mg x 4, mentioned as administration of zanamivir aqueous solution, but most 
patients (98%) were administered IV zanamivir. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 106/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Adverse events 
In the pivotal phase III study NAI114373, in the open-label phase II study NAI113678 with adult and 
paediatric cohorts and in the open-label study in Japanese patients NAI115215, the safety assessments 
included AE recording, haematology and clinical chemistry, ECGs, and vital signs. 
In the Compassionate use programme (study REL113375) physicians are asked to provide safety and 
clinical outcome data to GSK via a brief CRF. However, only SAE reporting is mandatory in accordance 
with local regulations. As the programme is not a GSK-sponsored clinical study, the quality and 
completeness of the data cannot be assured, and it is possible that not all SAEs have been reported. 
Completion of the CRF to collect safety and clinical follow-up information for patients in the CUP was 
optional and the CRF was only returned for 783/3063 patients (26%). Furthermore, as the CUP was not 
a clinical study, there was no monitoring and no mechanism to resolve inconsistencies or obtain missing 
data. Abnormal laboratory test results (haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsened 
from Baseline and judged by the treating physician to be clinically significant, were to be recorded as AEs 
or SAEs. As a condition of receiving zanamivir aqueous solution for compassionate use, treating 
physicians were asked to report all SAEs from the time of first dose through 14 days after completion of 
treatment to GSK. For analysis of safety, data was collected from a Master Summary Tracking Sheet 
including data on the patient and dosage, from the CRF filled in by the physician and from GSK Global 
Clinical and Pharmacovigilance database ARGUS, where adverse events where recorded. 
The retrospective chart review (NAI115008) was specifically designed to collect safety and clinical 
outcome data from any paediatric or pregnant patients (collectively referred to as the “Tier 1” cohort). In 
addition, as a secondary objective, data were collected from other adult patients (referred to as the “Tier 
2” cohort). 
In the clinical trials drug-related AEs were seen in 7-22% of adult patients and in 7% of children. Most 
common AEs in adults were diarrhoea (7%), constipation (6%), increase in liver transaminases (5%) and 
cytolytic hepatitis (4%). In the CUP, drug-related AEs were seen in 2% of patients, most common were 
pyrexia (<1%). In the CUP mostly treatment-related AEs were reported, but no pattern of drug-related 
AEs could be seen.  
In the following a more detailed overview of the AEs seen in the individual studies is given. The reactions 
seen in the clinical trials and in the CUP studies are reflected in the proposed SmPC section 4.8. All 
reactions should, however, be referred to in the table format with frequencies. 
An overall summary of AEs for IV zanamivir-treated subjects in the Phase II (NAI113678) and Phase III 
(NAI114373 – pivotal and NAI115215 – Japanese) studies is presented in Table below. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 107/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 48 
In general, the incidences of AEs across all categories in the adult cohort of Phase II Study NAI113678 
were higher compared with the Phase III study. This is not surprising given that the adult cohort of the 
Phase II study enrolled patients primarily during the H1N1 pandemic and immediate post-pandemic 
period. In addition, the adult cohort Phase II entry criteria favoured sicker patients compared with the 
Phase III study (e.g., Phase III patients had to be able to take oral medication for enrolment and fewer 
were in an ICU setting or receiving ECMO). 
Pivotal study NAI114373 (phase III) 
In the pivotal study NAI114373, the most common events were diarrhoea (6%) and constipation (5%). 
These AEs were also the most common events in the 600 mg IV zanamivir and 75 mg oseltamivir groups; 
diarrhoea and hypertension were the most common AEs in the 300 mg IV zanamivir group. In general, 
the nature and incidence of AEs were similar across treatment groups. 
Eighty-two subjects (13%) reported AEs considered by the investigator to have a possible causal 
relationship to the study drug, with slightly more considered attributable to study drug in the oseltamivir 
arm (17%) compared with the 300 mg and 600 mg IV zanamivir arms (12% and 11%, respectively). 
Overall, the most common drug-related AEs were diarrhoea, increased ALT, and increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), each occurring in a similar percentage of subjects in the 2 IV zanamivir groups 
as well as the oseltamivir group.

Table 49 
No safety signals or clinically significant trends in clinical laboratory values, vital signs or ECG values were 
identified that were considered attributable to IV zanamivir. 
Exclusion criteria were: Patients with creatinine clearance ≤10 mL/min who were not being treated with 
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), who required routine/intermittent haemodialysis or 
continuous peritoneal dialysis, who met liver chemistry toxicity criteria or with underlying chronic liver 
disease with evidence of severe liver impairment, who had a history of severe cardiac disease or clinically 
significant arrhythmia and female subjects who were pregnant or were breastfeeding were not included in 
the pivotal study. 
Supportive study NAI113678 (phase II) 
Adult cohort: 
Twenty-eight subjects (22%) reported AEs considered by the investigator to have a possible causal 
relationship to the study drug. The most common drug-related AEs were increased ALT (5%) and cytolytic 
hepatitis (4%).

There were no specific patient groups excluded from the study. Adjustment of dose were done to patients 
with impaired renal function. 
Paediatric cohort: 
Five subjects (7%) reported AEs considered by the investigator as possibly related to study drug (Table 
16). The most common drug-related AE was neutropenia, which was reported in 2 subjects (3%). Both 
incidences of treatment-related neutropenia were also indicated by the investigator to be related to 
influenza 
Table 51 
Exclusion criteria: There were no specific patient groups excluded from the study. 
Supportive study NAI115215 (Japanese cohort) 
Drug-related AEs during the On-treatment Period and Follow-up Period were reported in 3 subjects 
(14%). Reported drug-related AEs were injection site joint redness, pyrexia, diarrhoea, and haemoglobin 
decreased (1 subject each; 5%). 
There were no specific patient groups excluded from the study. Adjustments of dose were done to 
patients with impaired renal function. 
Compassionate use programme (study REL113375 and NAI115008) 
In study REL113375 treating physicians reported non-serious AEs for 4% of patients with a CRF. Renal 
and urinary disorders were most frequent (2%), followed by infections and infestations (1%), and 
investigations (1%). When summarised by AE preferred term, all non-serious AEs occurred in <1% of 
patients. The most frequently reported were: renal impairment (7 patients), renal failure (5 patients), 
and thrombocytopenia (5 patients). 
Treating physicians were asked on the CRF if there was a reasonable possibility that an AE may have been 
caused by zanamivir. A small percentage of patients (2%) had at least one non-serious AE that was 
considered possibly related to IV zanamivir treatment by the treating physician. The most frequent of 
these was pyrexia (4 patients [<1%]). 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018

Table 52 
In study NAI115008, the chart review, only AEs considered by the treating physician to be drug-related 
were reported. Treating physicians were asked to provide details on any treatment-emergent events they 
considered related to administration of zanamivir aqueous solution within the following body systems: 
cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, haematology, or renal organ systems, or other. No distinction 
was made between possibly or probably related. Of note, the individual who completed CRFs was not 
necessarily the treating physician. 
Among paediatric patients, treatment-emergent events were reported for 13 (26%) patients, most 
frequently in the renal organ system (7 [14%] patients). Few treatment-emergent events were 
documented in more than one patient; these included: renal failure in 6 patients (12%), hypotension in 
3 patients (6%), and renal impairment in 2 patients (4%). 
Among adult patients, treatment-emergent events were reported for 11 (17%) patients. Only one 
treatment-emergent event was recorded for a pregnant patient (circulatory disturbance). In adults, the 
greatest numbers of treatment-emergent AEs were reported for the cardiovascular organ system (14%). 
Overall, fewer patients in the Tier 1 pregnancy group (9%) had treatment-emergent events documented 
than in the Tier 2 adult group (19%). Treatment-emergent events reported for more than one adult 
patient included: 8 patients (13%) with hypotension, 3 patients (5%) with paralytic ileus, 3 patients (5%) 
with renal failure, 2 patients (3%) with acute neuro-psychologic disorder, and 2 patients (3%) with 
encephalopathy. 
The severity of AEs was not analysed in the CUP or in Study NAI115008. 
Both studies included patients treated during the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic 2009/2010. The chart 
review included both children and pregnant women.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Pivotal study NAI114373 
Grade 3 and 4 AEs: In total, 128 subjects (21%) reported any Grade 3 or 4 AEs, the incidence of which 
was similar across all 3 treatment groups (Table 18). Overall, the most common Grade 3 or 4 AEs were 
respiratory failure (1%, 3% and 1% of subjects in the 300 mg IV zanamivir, 600 mg IV zanamivir and 
oseltamivir arms, respectively) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (1%, 3% and <1% of subjects in 
the 300 mg IV zanamivir, 600 mg IV zanamivir and oseltamivir arms, respectively). 
Fifteen subjects (2%) reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs considered by the investigator to have a possible causal 
relationship with study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): A total of 109 subjects (18%) reported SAEs during the study. The 2 
most common SAEs were respiratory failure and pneumonia. Three SAEs were hepatic reactions. The 
nature and frequency of SAEs were similar across treatment groups. 
Table 53 
Fatal AEs: A total of 41 subjects (7%) died during the study, 15 subjects (7%) in each of the IV zanamivir 
arms and 11 subjects (5%) in the oseltamivir arm. The 3 most common causes of death were respiratory 
failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. Overall, there were no notable difference in 
nature and frequency of deaths across treatment groups. Two of the deaths (respiratory failure and 
worsening of influenza A) were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to 
zanamivir.

Supportive study NAI113678 
Adult cohort 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs: Fifty-seven subjects (44%) reported a Grade 3 or 4 AEs and 16 subjects (12%) 
reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship with study 
drug, the most common of which were cytolytic hepatitis (2%), ALT increased (2%), hepatic enzyme 
increased (2%) and encephalopathy (2%). 
Serious adverse events (AEs): Forty-four subjects (34%) reported SAEs during the study. The most 
common SAEs were pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock and cardiac arrest. Twenty-two subjects 
(17%) had SAEs while on study treatment. Seven subjects (5%) reported SAEs considered by the 
investigator to have a possible causal relationship with study drug. There were two cases each of cytolytic 
hepatitis and encephalopathy and one each of Torsade de Pointes, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular 
tachycardia and renal failure. 
Deaths: Twenty-six subjects (20%) died during the study. The most common causes of death were 
respiratory failure (4%), sepsis (2%), pneumonia (2%), multi-organ failure (2%) and bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis (2%). None of the deaths was considered by the investigator to have a possible causal 
relationship to zanamivir. Fourteen subjects (11%) died during the treatment period. 
Paediatric cohort: 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs: Twenty-three subjects (32%) reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs. The most common Grade 3 or 
4 AEs were hypotension (4%), neutropenia (4%), and respiratory failure (4%). Two subjects (3%) 
reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs considered by the investigator as possibly related to study drug (NAI113678 
Paediatric CSR Table 3.12). Both AEs were neutropenia reported for subjects in Cohort 2 and were also 
indicated to be related to influenza. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): Fifteen subjects (21%) reported SAEs during the study. The most 
common SAEs were tachycardia and respiratory failure. Six subjects (8%) reported SAEs during the 
treatment period. 
Drug-related SAEs: No subjects reported SAEs considered by the investigator as possibly related to study 
drug. 
Deaths: Five subjects (7%) died during the study. Multi-organ failure, encephalitis, brain herniation, 
lactic acidosis and respiratory failure were reported in one subject each. None of the deaths was 
considered by the investigator as possibly related to Zanamivir. Three subjects (4%) died during the 
treatment period.

Supportive study NAI115215 (Japanese) 
Grade 3 and 4 AEs: Grade 3 or 4 or severe AEs during the On-treatment Period plus Follow-up Period were 
reported in 2 subjects (10%). Reported Grade 3 or 4 or severe AEs during the On-treatment Period plus 
Follow-up Period were pneumonia bacterial, haemoglobin decreased, and hypokalaemia (1 subject each; 
5%). Pneumonia bacterial and hypokalaemia were reported in the same subject. Among Grade 3 or 4 or 
severe AEs, one case with haemoglobin decrease (level not provided) was considered to be drug related 
by the investigator. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs): SAEs including fatal SAE were reported in 4 subjects (19%) in the study. 
The reported non-fatal SAEs were respiratory tract infection, hyperthyroidism and haemoglobin 
decreased (1 subject each). Among non-fatal SAEs, haemoglobin decreased was considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator. 
Deaths: One subject (5%) died due to pneumonia bacterial during the study. This event was not 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
Compassionate use programme (study REL113375 and chart review NAI115008) 
REL113375 - Serious adverse events (SAEs): 
In study REL113375, as a condition of receiving zanamivir aqueous solution for compassionate use, 
treating physicians were asked to report all SAEs from the time of first dose through 14 days after 
completion of treatment to GSK. As of the 31 January 2017 data cut-off date, 411 patients had at least 
one SAE in the ARGUS database. 
Among the 411 patients with at least 1 SAE, the most frequently reported SAEs were death (18%), 
respiratory failure (14%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (11%). 
Among patients with at least one SAE, 73 had an SAE considered possibly related (or with an unknown 
relationship) to zanamivir aqueous solution treatment. Related SAEs were most frequently in the Blood 
and Lymphatic Systems or Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC.

Table 55 
By preferred term, the most frequent SAE considered possibly related (or with an unknown relationship) 
to treatment with zanamivir aqueous solution was acute kidney injury (8 patients [2%]), followed by 
alanine aminotransferase increased (5 patients [1%]) and hepatic failure (5 patients [1%]). 
REL 113375 - Deaths: 
Of the 411 patients with at least one SAE, 332 patients (81%) were known to have died, i.e., either had 
an SAE with an outcome of death, or had an SAE outcome other than death, but were otherwise known to 
have died. The estimated mortality rate for the CUP is therefore 332/3063 or 11%. Among the 411 
patients with at least 1 SAE, the most frequently reported SAEs for patient who were known to have died 
were death (18%), respiratory failure (13%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (11%). 
In summary, data from the CUP have significant limitations regarding the interpretation and extrapolation 
of results. Patients who were eligible for compassionate use treatment represented the most severely ill 
patient population and were treated with zanamivir aqueous solution as salvage therapy very late in their 
course of illness. As a result, patients were at high risk of severe/fatal outcomes and the lack of a control 
cohort makes safety data difficult to interpret. 
Completion of the CRF to collect safety and clinical follow-up information for patients in the CUP was 
optional and the CRF was only returned for 783/3063 patients (26%). Furthermore, as the CUP was not 
a clinical study, there was no monitoring and no mechanism to resolve inconsistencies or obtain missing 
data.

NAI115008 (chart review) - Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths: 
GSK’s safety reporting system (ARGUS) contains serious adverse event (SAE) reports for 23 patients who 
were included in the retrospective chart review, including 5 pregnant/postpartum patients. All SAEs were 
fatal except for events of hypernatremia, colitis, transient psychosis, pyrexia, and one SAE of cardiac 
arrest. 
Table 56 
Patients included in the retrospective chart review were a sample of severely ill hospitalised patients from 
around the world at the time of the 2009 influenza pandemic, most of whom (76%) had underlying 
medical conditions. Most patients (97%) were admitted to the ICU with all but 1 requiring ventilator 
support or supplemental oxygen, 27% receiving ECMO and the majority (79%) receiving inotropic 
medication, indicating multi-system organ failure. 
The mortality rate in the retrospective chart review, including non-pregnant adults, was higher than that 
reported in the overall CUP and Phase II Study NAI113678 and may indicate possible physician bias 
toward entering patients with fatal outcomes in the retrospective chart review. In addition, the degree of 
critical illness of these patients was possibly even more severe than in other described populations. 
The question of effectiveness of zanamivir IV treatment is not discussed in this context of fatal cases by 
the applicant, but “lack of efficacy” could have been considered a SAE in some of these cases. However, 
given the limitations of the CUP data and confounding factors, it is not possible to interpret the effect (or 
lack of effect) of zanamivir, when typically used as a last resort in patients with advanced disease.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Hepatic reactions 
Several liver-related adverse events were reported early in the open-label, single arm Phase II Study 
NAI113678. As a result, liver-related events were monitored closely during the remainder of the clinical 
programme. Adverse event and laboratory data from the blinded Phase III study of IV zanamivir 
(NAI114373) compared with oseltamivir show a low number of protocol-defined liver events (2%), and a 
similar incidence between treatment arms. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 116/143 
 
 
  
  
 
Pivotal study (NAI114373): 
The incidence of protocol defined liver events was low (14 subjects, 2%) and similar across treatment 
groups. Three events were SAEs and 11 were AEs, of which two were consistent with Hy’s Law criteria 
(ALT ≥3 upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin ≥2 ULN). One was seen in the oseltamivir group (possibly 
related), the other in the zanamivir 300 mg group (not related). Four cases with an ALT≥5xULN, but 
bilirubin ≤2xULN, were considered study drug related. The applicant concludes that zanamivir IV did not 
appear to be associated with the development of drug-induced liver injury. 
Supportive study (NAI113678): 
Adult cohort 
Seventeen subjects (13%) experienced protocol-defined liver events during the study; three were SAEs 
and 14 were AEs. Two of the 3 liver events which met the SAE criteria (i.e. Hy’s law criteria: ALT ≥ 3 times 
the upper limit of the normal range [ULN] and bilirubin ≥2xULN [>35% direct bilirubin]) were considered 
by the investigator to have a possible relationship to Zanamivir. However, one subject was in acute 
cardiac shock at Baseline and died shortly thereafter. In the other subject meeting Hy’s Law criteria, for 
whom the investigator assigned possible causality to zanamivir, ALT and bilirubin levels returned to 
Baseline by approximately 2 weeks following the end of IV zanamivir treatment. In the third subject with 
a liver SAE, the event was not attributed to study drug or participation, but to shock and underlying 
Hepatitis C. 
Of the 14 liver AEs in which an elevation of ALT of at least 5 times the upper limit of the normal range was 
observed but Hy’s law criteria were not met, 11 cases were considered by the investigator to be possibly 
study drug related. All 14 cases were reported to be ‘resolved’ ‘or ‘resolving’ by the end of the study. The 
subjects’ underlying influenza illness, other medical conditions and concomitant medications make 
evaluation of causality of hepatic related events difficult to assess. In the overall study population, there 
were no clinically significant trends in median ALT, AST and total bilirubin levels during or post-treatment. 
Of those with treatment-emergent ALT elevations in the IV zanamivir ≤5 days group, the majority were 
shifts from ‘normal’ to Grade 1 (n=10). Two subjects shifted from ‘normal’ to Grade 2 and two to 
Grade 3. Of the 18 subjects who were Grade 1 at Baseline, 3 subjects each shifted to Grade 2, Grade 3, 
and Grade 4. One subject improved from Grade 2 to Grade 1. For those subjects who were normal at 
Baseline in the >5 day treatment group, 6 subjects shifted to Grade 1, two to Grade 2, and two to Grade 
4. 
Of the 75 subjects who were normal for total bilirubin at Baseline in the ≤5-day treatment group, the 
majority remained in the normal category. Three subjects shifted from normal to Grade 1, 2 subjects each 
to Grade 2 and Grade 3, and 1 subject to Grade 4. Two subjects shifted from Grade 3 to 4. Two subjects 
improved and shifted from Grade 1 or 2 to normal. In the >5 day treatment group, the majority of 
subjects were normal at Baseline and remained normal. 
Paediatric cohort: 
Two subjects (3%) experienced protocol-defined liver events during the study; 1 met SAE criteria (ALT 
≥3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN] and bilirubin ≥2×ULN [>35% direct bilirubin]) and 1 
was an AE (ALT ≥5x ULN). Neither was considered by the investigator as possibly related to zanamivir. In 
the overall adolescent and paediatric study population there were no clinically significant trends in median 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST and total bilirubin levels during or posttreatment. 
Most subjects had ALT levels within the normal range at Baseline and remained ‘normal’ throughout the 
study. Five subjects with elevated ALT at Baseline improved during the study. Fourteen subjects had 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 117/143 
 
 
  
  
 
shifts to a higher grade. The majority of the shifts were from ‘normal’ to Grade 1 (n=9), and 2 subjects 
shifted from ‘normal’ to Grade 2. Two subjects shifted from Grade 1 to Grade 2 and 1 subject shifted from 
Grade 2 at Baseline to Grade 3. 
Most subjects had bilirubin levels within the normal range at Baseline and remained ‘normal’. Six 
subjects with elevated bilirubin at Baseline improved during the study. Six subjects had bilirubin shifts to 
a higher grade, all in cohorts 4 (6 to <13 years) and 5 (13 to <18 years). 
Supportive study NAI115215 (Japanese cohort):  
No hepatic events reported. 
Compassionate use programme 
Study REL113375:  
Since a number of liver-related AEs were reported early in the Phase II study (NAI113678), all hepatic 
events reported in the CUP are closely reviewed. Of the 411 patients who were reported to have at least 
one SAE, 39 patients had an event in the broad Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) “Drug-Related 
Hepatic Disorders - Comprehensive Search”. Of these 39 patients, 24 had a fatal outcome. All, with the 
exception of 2 cases with insufficient information, had multiple confounding factors including severity of 
the influenza-related disease, critical illness, underlying concurrent medical conditions, or concurrent 
medications. Overall, the majority of patients with reported hepatic findings were confounded and a 
causal association with zanamivir aqueous solution could not be established. 
Study NAI115008:  
In NAI115008, liver-related safety findings were reported as part of the clinical laboratory evaluations, 
but are discussed in this section to facilitate comparison across studies. 
Of the 84 patients for whom both abnormal ALT and AST values were reported at any time during the 
influenza hospitalisation, 46 patients had ALT or AST values >3xULN, while 15 patients had ALT or AST 
>20xULN. 
For the 16 patients with ALT >3xULN on treatment, ALT was ≥3xULN (or missing) at Baseline. Of the 26 
patients with abnormal on-treatment ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bilirubin values reported, 7 
patients had elevated values that met the "possible Hy’s Law" screening threshold for drug-induced liver 
injury (ALT >3xULN combined with bilirubin ≥2xULN and [ALP <3xULN or ALP missing]). Additional 
details are provided for each of these 7 patients in the NAI115008 CSR. For 3 cases the elevations 
occurred before the start of treatment with zanamivir aqueous solution (administered IV), which makes 
a causal relationship to zanamivir not possible. For the remaining 4 patients, elevated liver values were 
much more likely to have been caused by other factors than zanamivir aqueous solution. 
Cardiac reactions 
Serious treatment-related events in the cardiac disorders SOC were reported for one patient in the IV 
zanamivir 300 mg arm (one event of cardiac arrest, possibly related as considered by the investigator in 
NAI114373.  Two patients in the adult cohort of NAI113678 (3 events; Torsades de Pointes, ventricular 
arrhythmia and ventricular tachycardia). In the first case, the investigator considered that there was no 
reasonable possibility that the cardiac arrest was caused by zanamivir but that there was a reasonable 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 118/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
possibility that the ventricular arrhythmia and Torsades de Pointes may have been caused by zanamivir. 
However, the investigator also considered that the events were also possibly due to the concomitant 
medication, and the Torsades de Pointes to be complications of influenza. In the second case the 
investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the ventricular tachycardia may have 
been caused by zanamivir as no other cause was identified. 
In order to conduct a comprehensive review of the events of arrhythmias, a search of the GSK global 
safety database (ARGUS) using the Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) Broad for cardiac arrhythmias 
was conducted. Fifty-five cases were retrieved which described use of the IV formulation of zanamivir, 
most of which were from the CUP. Six cases were from the pivotal Phase III study, 10 cases were from the 
Phase II study and one came from retrospective chart review. All of the cases occurred in patients who 
were seriously unwell. Many described patients on mechanical ventilation and in 35 cases the outcome 
was fatal.  
Detailed review of individual cases does not support a causal relationship between IV zanamivir and 
cardiac arrhythmias in general, or between IV zanamivir and any particular type of cardiac arrhythmia. 
The reported cases are heavily confounded by the severely-ill status of patients receiving compassionate 
use treatment. Although “cardiac arrhythmias” is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) stated in the summary 
of product characteristics (SmPC) for oseltamivir, the scientific evidence for this is not apparent in the 
published literature, and there is no evidence to suggest a class effect.  
It is proposed that cardiac arrhythmia should be monitored through routine post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance activity. 
Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and skin reaction) 
In the Phase II/III studies, there was one, serious, related adverse event that may be suggestive of a 
hypersensitivity reaction. This was a case of respiratory failure in a 53-year-old in the IV zanamivir 600 
mg arm of NAI114373. However, on review of the case by the Applicant, the symptoms in this case did 
not suggest an allergic origin. In the CUP, serious, treatment-related events that may be indicative of 
hypersensitivity were reported in the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders SOC (3 rashes and one 
event of Stevens Johnson Syndrome). A review of clinical trials data and the cases of hypersensitivity and 
IV zanamivir in the GSK global safety database supports the addition of ‘rash’ and “urticaria” to the SmPC 
as ADRs in Section 4.8 with the frequencies of common and uncommon, respectively.  
The current evidence does not support the addition of specific hypersensitivity terms, such as anaphylaxis 
or serious cutaneous adverse reactions with IV zanamivir. However, in view of the fact that 
hypersensitivity reactions are stated in the SmPC for zanamivir for inhalation it will also be added to 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC for IV zanamivir and a warning in SmPC 4.4 in line with SmPC for zanamivir for 
inhalation. Allergic-type reactions, including oropharyngeal oedema, facial oedema, 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and severe skin reactions including erythema multiforme, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis to be listed with frequency “not known”. 
Laboratory findings 
No abnormalities in laboratory tests were identified in any of the studies submitted. 
Abnormal hepatic tests are not commented in this part; see discussion above. 
ECG data have not reported clinically relevant changes, however, arrhythmias were reported as SAEs for 
a few patients; see above.

Safety in special populations 
Age related aspects  
Table 57 
Adverse reaction data has not identified any special safety concerns for a paediatric population. 
In the supportive Study NAI113678, SAEs were reported less frequently in younger children (<6 years of 
age, 10%) relative to older children (6 to <13 years, 30%), adolescents (13 to <18 years, 29%), and 
adults (34%). 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 120/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Among the paediatric and adolescent subjects, 2 of 71 (3%) experienced protocol-defined liver events. In 
contrast, 13% of adult subjects experienced liver events during the study. The difference may have been 
related to the higher overall morbidity of the adult subjects or to the high prevalence of influenza 
A/H1N1pdm2009 circulating when adults were enrolled into the study. Liver-related events are known to 
be associated with severe influenza, and multisystem organ failure was a key feature of influenza A 
H1N1pdm2009 in hospitalised critically ill subjects [Jain, 2009; Writing Committee of the WHO, 2010]. 
In the pivotal Study NAI114373, while the median age of the study population was nearly 10 years older 
than the study population in the adult cohort of NAI113678 (57 years versus 47.5 years) and there were 
20% more subjects enrolled who were ≥60 years of age (44% versus 24%), no new or additional safety 
findings were observed in Study NAI114373 compared with the adult cohort of Study NAI113678. 
In the zanamivir 600 mg arm of the Phase III study NAI114373, 134 patients were <65 years of age, 36 
were between 65 and <75, 29 were between 75 and <85 and 10 were 85 years or older. In the zanamivir 
600 mg arm, treatment-related AEs were reported for 12%, 14%, 3% and 0% for these age groups, 
respectively. The nature of the related AEs was similar across the age groups and the data did not indicate 
special safety concerns for the older adults. 
Ethnicity 
In the pivotal Phase III study (NAI114373), the Study NAI113678 adult cohort, and the Study NAI113678 
paediatric cohort, the majority of subjects were Caucasian (76%, 75%, and 68%, respectively). In Study 
NAI115215, which was conducted in Japan, all subjects were Asian. 
There were no notable differences in the nature or frequency of treatment-emergent AEs reported for 
subjects from Japan in Study NAI115215 compared with the subjects in Study NAI114373 or Study 
NAI113678. 
In the adult cohort of NAI113678 75% were Caucasian, 8% African-American and 8% South-East Asian. 
In the paediatric cohort 68% were Caucasian, 18% African American/African, and 4% Japanese, 4% 
mixed race. In NAI114373 76% of subjects were Caucasian, 7% East Asian, 6% Central Asian and 4% 
African American/African. Furthermore, there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons to 
suspect that the safety profile will be significantly different in Asian populations. 
Use in patients with renal impairment (study NAI108127) 
Sixteen subjects with renal impairment were enrolled and all received a 100 mg single dose of IV 
zanamivir. Very few AEs were reported during the study. Only 2 AEs were reported in more than 1 
subject: diarrhoea (3 subjects) and headache (3 subjects). Four subjects had AEs considered by the 
investigator to be drug-related, including abdominal pain, headache, and diarrhoea (1 subject each) and 
1 subject with weakness, light headedness, intermittent pounding sensation, and rash on the arms and 
face. All these AEs resolved within 5 minutes to 4 days. No clinically significant changes in clinical 
laboratory data, vital signs, or ECGs were observed. 
Use in pregnancy 
The supportive Phase II Study NAI113678 allowed inclusion of pregnant women. Three subjects were 
pregnant (one in the second trimester, two in the third trimester), and 1 subject was 1 day postpartum. 
All 3 pregnant subjects survived and gave birth to healthy infants. No SAEs were reported in the pregnant 
or postpartum subjects. 
Up to the data-lock point of 31 January 2017 in the CUP, 59 patients received zanamivir either during 
pregnancy or shortly postpartum/post-foetal death. Limited information has been received in the global 
safety database for 16 pregnant/postpartum patients. Of these, 12 were pregnant and four were 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 121/143 
 
 
  
  
postpartum. The outcome for the pregnant mothers was fatal in 5 patients, positive in 6 patients and 
unknown in 1 patient. Serious AEs were reported in 9 pregnant patients. 
The CUP retrospective chart review (NAI115008), Tier 1 included 8 pregnant patients and 3 postpartum 
patients (1 to 14 days post-delivery). Of the 8 patients who were pregnant at hospital admission, 4 were 
in the second trimester and 4 were in third trimester of pregnancy; all of these patients received 
zanamivir aqueous solution via the IV route of administration. Only 1 treatment-emergent event was 
recorded for a pregnant patient (circulatory disturbance). Overall, fewer patients in the Tier 1 pregnancy 
group (9%) had treatment-emergent events documented than in the Tier 2 adult group (19%). Four of 
the 11 pregnant/postpartum patients (36%) died. 
No specific trend in difference in the safety profile was seen between different age groups in children. 
Most differences seen between studies in adults may be related to morbidity status of patients at baseline 
and influenza seasoning. 
Based on the data provided, it is difficult to conclude on safety in pregnancy. Animal models have shown 
that placental transfer of zanamivir occurs. However, it is not known if this can occur in humans. 
Non-clinical data did not indicate a risk of teratogenicity or maternal or foetal toxicity at exposures 
approximately 3 times the human exposure at the clinical intravenous dose (600 mg BID). 
Exposure in pregnant women with IV zanamivir is limited and the effect of IV zanamivir administered in 
pregnancy is unknown.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
From Relenza (zanamivir for inhalation) it is known that zanamivir is not bound to proteins, and is not 
metabolized, nor modified in the liver.  Clinically relevant interactions are therefore not expected.  A drug 
interaction study (NAI112977) was performed in collaboration with the Influenza Clinical Research 
Network in Thailand [Pukrittayakamee, 2011]. The results indicated there was no evidence for significant 
PK interaction between IV zanamivir with oral oseltamivir 150 mg BID that could result in a change in the 
safety profile of IV zanamivir. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were 7-15% of the reported AEs that were leading to premature discontinuation from the study. 
Most of these were related to different kind of respiratory impairment and can be disease related. 
In the studies, 3 - 13% reported AEs were leading to premature discontinuation of investigational 
product. A wide spectrum of AEs leading to discontinuity were reported, including respiratory and hepatic 
reactions, and no specific pattern can be seen. Many of these may be disease related as well. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile has been assessed based on 844 patients in clinical trials and 3149 patients in the 
Compassionate Use Programme. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 122/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety profile 
The safety profile is rather similar in both 300 mg BID and 600 mg BID zanamivir drug-related AEs 
observed in 11-22%. The safety profile for zanamivir IV is similar to the safety profile of oral oseltamivir 
(drug-related AEs observed in 17%). Drug-related AEs were observed less commonly in children (7%). 
However, in the chart review study, about 26% of children were reported with treatment-emergent 
reactions. 
In adults, the most common drug-related AEs in the clinical trials are gastrointestinal (diarrhoea) and 
hepatic reactions (transaminase increased, cytolytic hepatitis). In the compassionate use programmes, 
the most common drug-related AEs was pyrexia (REL113375 study) and in the chart review most 
frequent reported treatment-emergent events in adult patients was hypotension, paralytic ileus, renal 
failure, acute neuro-psychologic disorder and encephalopathy. 
In children, neutropenia was most commonly observed in the clinical trial. In the compassionate use 
programmes, renal reactions were reported in 10%. Few treatment-emergent events were documented 
in more than one patient; renal failure, hypotension and renal impairment. 
Causality assessment is in most patients confounded by co-mortality of the patients. Given the small 
number of clinical trials and the duration of follow-up on patients who participated in the studies, the 
clinical development programme for IV zanamivir is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or 
cumulative exposure. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs were seen in 18% in the pivotal study (7% died), 34% (20% died) in adults and 21% (7% died) in 
children the supportive study. In the CUP data, SAEs occurred in 13% of cases, of which 81% died. A 
majority of the SAEs were death, respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. Given the limitations of the CUP data and confounding factors, it is not possible to 
interpret the effect (or lack of effect) of zanamivir, when typically used as a last resort in patients with 
advanced disease.    
Cardiac reactions 
A few cases of treatment-related cardiac reactions (cardiac arrest, Torsade de Pointes, ventricular 
arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia) were reported in the clinical trials which may have been caused 
by zanamivir and fifty-five cases of arrhythmias were identified the CUP studies. Cardiac reactions 
(cardiac arrhythmias) are listed as important potential risk in the RMP and to be further monitored 
through routine pharmacovigilance. 
Hepatic reactions 
The assessment of causality of hepatic reactions during zanamivir treatment can be difficult in patient 
groups included in the studies. In particular because of high degree of co-morbidity in patients 
hospitalised because of influenza and because abnormal liver function tests (increased transaminases) 
are reported in about 20% of patients with influenza (Polakos NK et al., Am J Path 2006;168: no 4; Jain 
S et al., N Engl J Med 2009;361;1-10). 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 123/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, majority of the cases were firstly treated with oseltamivir, then with zanamivir. Hepatic 
reactions like increase in transaminases and a few cases of hepatic failure, cholestasis and hepatocellular 
injury have been considered related to zanamivir treatment. Hepatotoxicity is not discussed in the 
non-clinical assessment. 
The safety profile has been found similar for zanamivir and oseltamivir in the pivotal study. Hepatic 
reactions like increased transaminases, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and hepatitis is listed in SmPC 
4.8 for oseltamivir. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations, 
alkaline phosphatase increased and hepatocellular injury are proposed to be listed for Dectova in SmPC 
4.8. To collect more knowledge on risk of hepatic reactions during treatment with zanamivir IV it is added 
as potential important risks in the RMP. 
Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and skin reaction) 
In the CUP, there was one event of Stevens Johnson Syndrome was reported (not confirmed on review). 
A review of clinical trials data and the cases of hypersensitivity and IV zanamivir in the GSK global safety 
database supports the addition of ‘rash’ and “urticaria” to the SmPC as ADRs in Section 4.8 with the 
frequencies of common and uncommon, respectively and severe skin reactions including erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic with frequency “not known”. 
The current evidence does not support the addition of specific hypersensitivity terms, such as anaphylaxis 
or serious cutaneous adverse reactions with IV zanamivir. However, in view of the fact that these 
hypersensitivity reactions are stated in the SmPC for zanamivir for inhalation it will also be added to 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC for IV zanamivir and a warning in SmPC 4.4 in line with SmPC for zanamivir for 
inhalation.  Allergic-type reactions including oropharyngeal oedema, facial oedema, 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to be listed with frequency “not known”. 
Pregnancy 
Safety in pregnancy is still considered as missing information. Limited serious adverse event data in 
pregnant/post-partum women from the ARGUS global safety database (n=59, with outcomes for 16 
patients) did not identify any special safety concerns for this population. The proposal of a PASS 
(pregnancy registry) is endorsed. The study will be initiated when there is wide-spread resistance to 
oseltamivir and circulating influenza virus is susceptible to zanamivir. This might be far in the future, 
while pregnant women may be exposed from the time of marketing. It is proposed the Pregnancy registry 
should be established from the time of marketing and patients included consecutively as they are exposed 
independently of the pattern of resistance. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional expert consultations 
None. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of zanamivir IV is similar to oseltamivir as found in the pivotal study. The true safety 
profile is difficult to assess as the patients included were highly ill with influenza and had a high degree of 
co-morbidity. Mortality is rather high, but is considered associated to the seriousness of the influenza to 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018

be treated and often related to respiratory related problems. Most drug-related AEs observed were 
diarrhoea and constipation in addition to increase in transaminases. A few serious hepatic reactions were 
seen. The causality in this severely ill population is difficult to assess, but cases have been considered 
drug-related by the investigator and the association to use of zanamivir cannot be fully excluded. The 
same is for some of the cases reported on cardiac arrhythmias and skin reactions.  As appropriate, 
reactions are reflected in the proposed SmPC section 4.4 (warnings on hypersensitivity reactions) and in 
SmPC section 4.8 (hepatic and hypersensitivity reactions). 
The safety specifications in the RMP include hepatic failure and cardiac arrhythmias as important potential 
risks. 
The proposal of a PASS to collect more knowledge on safety during pregnancy is endorsed.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested the harmonisation of the PSUR 
cycle with the Data Lock Point (DLP) of zanamivir, inhalation powder. Therefore, 31 January will be used 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Relenza (zanamivir inhaled). The bridging report submitted 
by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Dectova (zanamivir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is approved under exceptional circumstances under Article 14 (8) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final proposed indication for Dectova is: 
“Dectova is indicated for the treatment of complicated and potentially life-threatening influenza A or B 
virus infection in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months) when: 
• 
The patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to anti-influenza medicinal 
products other than zanamivir, and/or 
•  Other anti-viral medicinal products for treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are 
not suitable for the individual patient. 
Dectova should be used in accordance with official guidance.” 
There are no successful development programs with randomized, placebo controlled studies to provide 
robust evidence of efficacy in patients hospitalized due to influenza. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018

The main clinical endpoints in clinical trials to support registration of products in the treatment of 
influenza have generally included time to clinical response, with clinical response defined by a reduction 
of influenza symptoms, including fever and impact on respiratory status. Other endpoints that have been 
evaluated include mortality, complications following the influenza disease and functionality status.  
Virological endpoints such as reduction of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs, are not considered 
surrogate for clinical benefit. Still, the characterization of antiviral activity, as well as the pattern of 
resistance, including cross-resistance with other agents, forms an important part of a development 
program. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
All EU Member States recommend neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), in combination with clinical 
supportive care, for treatment of severe, complicated or progressive illness, and for patients at high risk 
of complications, irrespective of vaccination status.  Oseltamivir oral (Tamiflu), zanamivir inhalation 
(Relenza) and peramivir IV (Alpivab) have received a Marketing Authorisation in Europe for treatment of 
influenza.  For peramivir IV, the indication is limited to uncomplicated influenza.  The reason for this 
limitation was lack of conclusive evidence of efficacy in hospitalised patients.  In the case of oseltamivir 
oral and zanamivir inhalation, which are older products, the indication has no such limitation, even though 
these products have no efficacy data in hospitalised influenza patients based on randomized 
placebo-controlled studies. Nevertheless, oseltamivir is the recommended standard treatment in this 
patient population. The extensive use of oseltamivir is based on efficacy shown for uncomplicated 
influenza in outpatients, impact on viral load, case reports and retrospective studies in hospitalised 
influenza patients.  
In a situation where the H275Y mutation in H1N1, a strain resistant to both oseltamivir and peramivir, is 
circulating, or other mutations with similar resistance pattern is circulating, there is a medical need for 
agents  to which such variants are susceptible. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
NAI114373. The main study NAI114373 was randomized, double-blind, with three arms, comparing 600 
mg IV Zanamivir with comparator 75 mg oral oseltamivir and 300 mg IV Zanamivir. A total number 615 
(ITT) patients aged ≥16 years were recruited which included 205 randomised to the control arm. 
The primary endpoint was time to clinical response (TTCR). The patient population was hospitalised adults 
and adolescents (> 16 years) with influenza. A superiority analysis for the primary endpoint was 
performed. Further, the use of placebo control was considered inappropriate given the above mentioned 
guideline recommendations.  
Main inclusion Criteria 
Presence of influenza symptoms (fever, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, hearth rate, blood pressure) 
and laboratory confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection.  Onset of influenza within 6 days prior to 
study enrollment. 
Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects who had taken more than a total of 3 days of approved anti-influenza therapy in the period from 
onset of symptoms and prior to enrolment; subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, were not 
likely to survive beyond 48 hours from Baseline; subjects with creatinine clearance ≤ 10 mL/min. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 128/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Subjects who required (ECMO) at Baseline; subjects with underlying chronic liver disease or history of 
severe cardiac disease. 
Endpoints NAI114373 
The primary endpoint was the time to clinical response (TTCR) in subjects with confirmed influenza. 
Clinical response was defined as resolution of at least 4 of the 5 signs within the respective resolution 
criteria, maintained for at least 24 hours, or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. The 5 responses 
were: fever AND oxygen saturation AND 2 out of 3, including respiratory status, heart rate and systolic 
blood pressure. Similar endpoint has been used for hospitalised influenza patients for other anti-influenza 
drugs. 
NAI113678. This supportive study was an open-label, single arm study. Patients ≥6 months old, 130 in 
adult cohort and 71 in paediatric cohort. 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) Zanamivir in the 
treatment of hospitalized adult, adolescent and paediatric subjects with influenza infection. Children age 
categories: 6 months<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <18 years.  This was mainly a safety 
study, but virology and clinical endpoints as well as pharmacokinetics were included. The study was 
initiated in 2009 during the H1N1 pandemic and for the adult population H1N1pdm2009 was the 
dominating strain.  
NAI115215. This supportive study was open-label, single arm study. in 21 patients aged ≥16 years. 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of 600 mg of IV Zanamivir twice daily in 
the treatment of hospitalized subjects with influenza infection. 
NAI115008. This was an observational, retrospective, multi-center, cohort data collection study from 
the Compassionate Use program.  This contains reports from 63 adults including pregnant and 50 
paediatric patients. The treating physician reviewed recorded data including demographics, medical data, 
safety variables and treatment outcomes on a paper CRF. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Data from the single pivotal Phase III study NAI114373 demonstrated clinical benefit, antiviral effect and 
safety that was at least comparable to oseltamivir, the global standard of care.  The median times to 
clinical response in days were not statistically different for IV zanamivir 600 mg and oseltamivir 75 mg.  
This was consistent in both the total influenza positive population and the subgroups: ICU/mechanical 
ventilation and symptom onset ≤ 4 days, which were part of the primary endpoint analysis.  The median 
time to clinical response was 0.48 days shorter for IV zanamivir 600 mg compared to oseltamivir 75 mg.  
For the population of subjects who were PCR positive at Baseline from nasopharyngeal swabs (N=410), 
the median time to virologic improvement for influenza A and B from nasopharyngeal swabs was 3.0 days 
for all treatment arms. Virological improvement was defined as a 2 log drop in viral load and the rate of 
success for those positive at baseline were 90% for zanamivir IV 600 mg and 92% for oseltamivir 75 mg. 
There was minimal circulating influenza oseltamivir resistance during 2011-2015, the period of study 
conduct for NAI114373. Antiviral activity was very similar across treatment arms. Six subjects on 
oseltamivir developed treatment-emergent resistance (4 subjects developed H275Y in H1N1 strains, 1 
subject developed D198D/G and another R292R/K both in H3N2 strains) and 1 subjects on the 300 mg IV 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 129/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
zanamivir arm developed potential treatment-emergent resistance (T325I in H3N2 strain). No treatment 
emergent resistance was observed in subjects on the 600 mg IV zanamivir. 
The results of the supportive studies were generally consistent with the results of the pivotal study. Data 
from the clinical studies conducted as part of the IV zanamivir programme as well as data from the global 
CUP contribute to an assessment of the clinical benefit of the product. Clinical data are available from 
study NAI113678 and the CUP, and these patients are more closely matched to the proposed target 
population than the pivotal study. In the global CUP, over 3,000 patients have been treated with 
zanamivir (99% IV). Clinical data from NAI113678 is limited by its single arm, open-label design; 
however, subjects were observed to have a rapid antiviral response to 600 mg IV zanamivir treatment 
despite most patients having been treated with oseltamivir prior to study enrolment. Most adult subjects 
in this study were critically ill, with the majority in ICU and many on MV or ECMO. Treatment emergent 
resistance to zanamivir was not observed in the adult subjects with the exception of one adult subject 
where treatment-emergent resistance was noted in one sample (E119D) but not on subsequent samples. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Since superiority over oral oseltamivir was not demonstrated, and as there are no randomised studies 
comparing oseltamivir with placebo in hospitalised patients with complicated influenza, the available data 
do not provide comprehensive evidence of the clinical efficacy of Zanamivir in the population of 
hospitalized influenza patients.  
Further on, in the study programme, the number of paediatric patients in each age interval is small: n=7 
(6m to< 1y), n=11 (1 to<2y), n=12 (2 <6y), n=27 (6 to<13y), n=14 (13 to<18y). A comparison with 
the adult population in the same study (NAI113678) is difficult because the adults were exposed to the 
pandemic H1N1pdm09 strain and experienced high mortality and more severe disease compared to the 
children. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Exposure to IV zanamivir (irrespective of dose) is limited to 844 subjects within clinical trials, of which 643 
received IV zanamivir as treatment for complicated influenza. The database includes a direct comparison 
with oral oseltamivir for 410 subjects with complicated influenza who were treated with 300 mg or 600 mg 
IV BID regimens. In the CUP, there were 3063 patients exposed as of 31 January 2017, of which 98% 
received IV administration, but there was no prospective and systematic collection of AEs in this total 
CUP. In addition, AEs have been assessed in a chart review study including 113 patients from the CUP. 
Safety in adults 
In adults, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs in the clinical trials are gastrointestinal 
(diarrhoea) and hepatic reactions (variably ALT and/or AST increases)); while in the CUP data pyrexia was 
the most commonly reported event. In this seriously ill population, a few cases of cardiovascular AEs 
including hypotension as well as renal failure, paralytic ileus and neuropsychiatric reactions were 
reported.  
In the pivotal study, AEs deemed to be drug-related were observed in 11% of patients in the 600mg IV 
treatment group as compared to 17% in the oral Oseltamivir group. In the pivotal study, Grade 3 and 4 
laboratory abnormalities (whether considered drug-related or unrelated) occurred at similar rates in 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 130/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
zanamivir and oseltamivir groups. There was no excess of ALT ≥5xULN in the zanamivir groups. In elderly, 
treatment-related AEs were reported for 12%, 14%, 3% and 0% for the age groups <65, 65 to <75, 75 
to <85 and ≥85, respectively. The nature of the related AEs was similar across the age groups and the 
data did not indicate special safety concerns for the older adults. 
Overall the safety profile of zanamivir and oseltamivir were similar. 
Safety in children 
Neutropenia was the most commonly reported adverse effect in the clinical trial NAI113678. In the CUP 
data, renal adverse effects were reported in 10%. There were no specific trends that were noticed in the 
rate or severity of different adverse events reported in children. In the chart review subgroup of the CUP, 
the reported incidence of adverse events in children was 26%, and the most frequently involved organ 
system was the renal organ system (7 [14%] patients). Few treatment-emergent events were 
documented in more than one patient; these included: renal failure in 6 patients (12%), hypotension in 
3 patients (6%), and renal impairment in 2 patients (4%). For this dataset, there is no comparator arm. 
Serious adverse events 
In the pivotal study, a total of 109 subjects (18%) reported SAEs and a total of 41 (7%) subjects died. The 
most common SAEs were respiratory failure and pneumonia. The nature and frequency of SAEs were 
similar across treatment groups. SAEs deemed drug-related by the investigator were less than 1% in 
zanamivir arms and was 1% in the oseltamivir arm. In the CUP data, SAEs were reported in 13% of cases 
and 81% of the reported SAEs was death. 
SAEs that were deemed drug related by the investigator were few. Six cases (<1%) in the pivotal study: 
One case of cardiac arrest and one case of influenza in the group administered 300mg zanamivir BID and 
one case with respiratory failure in the 600 mg BID group). In the oseltamivir group, there were three 
SAEs (1%) that were deemed drug related, which included one case with drug-induced liver injury, one 
case with ECG signs of ventricular hypertrophy and one case of allergic dermatitis. 
SAEs deemed related by the investigator in the supportive study were seven cases (5%) in the adult 
cohort: Two cases of cytolytic hepatitis, two cases of encephalopathy, one case each of Torsade de 
pointes, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia and renal failure. None SAEs was considered 
related to zanamivir treatment in the paediatric cohort. 
In the CUP data 18% (73/411) had SAEs related to zanamivir treatment, most frequently reported was 
reactions to Blood and Lymphatic System Disorder (3%) and to Renal and Urinary Disorders (3%) – most 
common term were acute kidney injury (eight patients - 2%), ALT increase (1%) and hepatic failure 
(1%). 
Cardiac reactions 
Few cases of Zanamivir treatment-related cardiac reactions (one case each of cardiac arrest, Torsade de 
Pointes, ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia) were reported in all the clinical trials 
combined and fifty-five cases of arrhythmias were identified in the CUP Cardiac arrhythmias is 
characterized as an important potential risk. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 131/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and skin reaction) 
In the Phase II/III studies, there was no serious drug-related hypersensitivity reaction such as 
anaphylaxis, but one event of Stevens Johnson Syndrome was reported in the CUP. Cases of ‘rash’ and 
“urticaria” were identified in the GSK global safety database. 
Renal toxicity 
Zanamivir is eliminated by renal clearance; therefore, the dose of zanamivir when administered 
intravenously must be reduced in patients with renal impairment. Renal impairment is common in 
hospitalised patients with influenza or other chronic underlying conditions, however it is routine practice 
to monitor renal function in hospitalised patients and therefore this risk should be adequately mitigated. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The causality assessment of adverse events is in most patients confounded by co-morbidity of the 
patients. 
It is not possible to evaluate with certainty, the causality of these events to zanamivir treatment. Notably, 
in the pivotal study, the safety profile of zanamivir did not markedly differ from that of oseltamivir. The 
majority of cases were associated with disease progression or comorbidity and symptoms of severe 
influenza disease. A review of all deaths reported in the two CUP studies including all pertinent 
information (including information on co-morbidity, antiviral treatment before zanamivir IV treatment 
started and time period from influenza debut till zanamivir treatment was started) did not raise any 
significant concerns. Further, the data from CUP is considered to be less robust than from clinical studies 
due to the severity of the underlying illness as well as the lack of a comparator arm. 
Notably, abnormal liver function tests (increased transaminases) are reported in about 20% of patients 
with influenza (Polakos NK et al Am J Path 2006;168: no 4, Jain S et al N Eng j Med 2009;361;1-10). 
Furthermore, majority of the cases were firstly treated with oseltamivir, then with zanamivir. However, in 
several cases the study drug was discontinued due to hepatic reactions according to the criteria in the 
study protocol. Hence, it is considered that a possible causality to zanamivir or a contribution of zanamivir 
cannot be excluded. 
Although the available data in children shows the safety profile to be consistent with that in adults, the 
number of children included and the spread in adverse events reported are limited and so there are some 
residual uncertainties. 
Since the risk of DDIs appears to be low, no safety issue is expected due to PK interactions,  however 
direct clinical experience demonstrating lack of DDI is limited. 
Pregnancy/lactation 
Pregnant women are recognised as a high-risk group as they suffer disproportionately from 
severe/complicated influenza requiring hospitalisation. There are insufficient data on the use of IV 
zanamivir in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risk. Data from several clinical studies have not 
shown an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes following in utero exposure to inhaled zanamivir, 
but due to limited sample sizes and significant differences in exposure between 10 mg inhaled and 600 
mg administered intravenously, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the safety of zanamivir 
in pregnancy. Reproductive studies performed in rats and rabbits indicated that placental transfer of 
zanamivir occurs but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Results from a rat peri and post-natal study 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 132/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
showed no clinically meaningful impairment of offspring development. A limited number of pregnant 
women participated in the clinical program (Phase II study NAI113678 and CUP), and while no adverse 
effects on the mother or fetus have been reported, the numbers are too small to draw robust conclusions 
on the safety in this population. 
Safety in pregnancy and during lactation is still considered as missing information. The proposal of a PASS 
(pregnancy) is endorsed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with oseltamivir is the recommended standard of care for patients with complicated influenza, 
even if no placebo-controlled studies have been performed demonstrating efficacy in such patients. The 
recommendation for such use is based on the ability of the oseltamivir to reduce viral load, the reduction 
of clinical symptoms in uncomplicated influenza demonstrated in placebo-controlled randomised studies, 
case reports and observational studies in hospitalised patients and a large number of nonclinical and in 
vitro studies. 
The data from the controlled randomised study included in this dossier indicate that treatment with 
zanamivir 600 mg IV and oseltamivir 75 mg treatment result in comparable results related to both clinical 
endpoints and viral load in a hospitalised influenza population. The impact of treatment on outcome, 
however, is definitely confirmed, since there is no effect estimate for the comparator, oseltamivir, and 
there was no placebo arm.

Seasonal influenza strains as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza strains are susceptible to the 
antiviral effects of neuramindase inhibitors. The resistance profile of zanamivir differs from oseltamivir 
and peramivir in the case of the H275Y mutation in H1N1. While the strain is resistant to oseltamivir and 
peramivir, it remains sensitive to zanamivir. The H275Y may appear during treatment with oseltamivir 
and was also seen circulating in a large proportion of isolated influenza viruses ten years ago. In a 
situation where the H275Y mutation in H1N1 is circulating, or other mutation with similar resistance 
pattern is circulating, a medical need for an agent presumed to be active is identified.  Further, it is 
asserted that highly pathogenic avian influenza strains are also sensitive to the neuraminidases and 
zanamivir IV could theoretically prove useful as treatment during any emerging pandemic (with or 
without avian strains), when the condition of the patient warrants IV administration. 
In response to the need for further justification for use of zanamivir in complicated influenza the applicant 
has presented an extensive overview of public health guidelines from Europe and globally, as well as 
recent reviews on clinical data to support current recommendations. Guidelines from USA, England WHO, 
ECDC, Japan and Australia have been presented.  NAIs are generally recommended for use against severe 
influenza. The recent confirmation of the public health recommendations about the use of NAIs together 
with the fact that 3000 patients have received IV zanamivir in compassionate use program, demonstrates 
the medical need involved. It is unfortunate that the absolute efficacy of NAIs in the treatment of 
complicated influenza has not been determined in RCTs against placebo, and probably never will due to 
the inherent difficulties involved. However, in spite of the deficiencies in the evidence, it is a fact that NAIs 
have for a long time been used as a standard of care in hospitalised influenza patients and there are data 
from different sources (observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses) to support the 
recommendations and clinical use. 
The safety profile of zanamivir IV is similar to oseltamivir as found in the pivotal study. Mortality is rather 
high, but is considered associated to the seriousness of the influenza to be treated and often due to 
problems related to respiration. Most AEs deemed drug related by the investigator, that were observed 
were diarrhoea and constipation in addition to increase in transaminases. A few serious hepatic reactions 
were seen. The causality of adverse drug reactions in this severely ill population is difficult to assess. The 
same is true, for some of the cases reported on cardiac arrhythmias and neutropenia. Hypersensitivity 
reactions, including anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions have been reported with NAIs and might be a 
risk for zanamivir IV as well. Overall, the available data shows that the adverse effect profile of zanamivir 
is comparable to that of oseltamivir. 
In addition, the larger experience with use of zanamivir inhalation has not identified any serious safety 
concerns, which is reassuring. However, the systemic exposure when zanamivir is administered by the 
inhaled route is considerably lower. Therefore, the reassurance that can be drawn from the clinical 
experience with inhaled zanamivir is subject to limitations. 
Safety in pregnant and lactating women is considered missing information. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Oseltamivir is currently the standard treatment used in hospitals for influenza. That is so even if efficacy 
data from placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials in hospitalised patients with complicated influenza 
is lacking. Data from the comparative study NAI114373 show similar outcomes for oseltamivir and 
zanamivir IV on clinical and virological endpoints; however the clinical efficacy of zanamivir cannot be 
demonstrated by this study, since the efficacy of oseltamivir in complicated influenza has not been 
established by placebo-controlled randomized control studies.  Rather, the indication of efficacy is 
inferred based on in vitro virology, animal studies, a challenge study in healthy volunteers, the efficacy 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 135/143 
 
 
  
  
 
seen for inhaled zanamivir as well as oseltamivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor in uncomplicated 
influenza, and the plasma and BAL exposure reached at the selected dose. 
The benefit of IV zanamivir can be inferred based on: 
• 
evidence of adequate exposure at the infection target tissue (upper and lower respiratory tract), 
as compared to inhaled zanamivir, which has proven efficacy against uncomplicated influenza;  
•  demonstrated in vitro susceptibility and in vivo efficacy in preclinical models of infection; 
• 
comparable effects of zanamivir iv and oseltamivir iv in study NAI114373; 
• 
• 
• 
extrapolation of the efficacy  from the Phase III randomised placebo-controlled studies of other 
NAIs  conducted in patients with uncomplicated influenza, to that of the complicated setting; 
particularly with Relenza (inhaled zanamivir) against which comparable plasma and BAL fluid 
exposure levels are available; 
extrapolation of the available evidence supporting the public health guidance on use of 
neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment of, hospitalized patients with influenza illness, and 
a generally favourable safety profile of NAIs including zanamavir i.v. 
The Applicant has discussed and argued for the justification for submitting under exceptional 
circumstances based on the unmet need in the niche indication and the difficulty to generate conclusive 
evidence in the current circumstances, to which the CHMP agreed (see 3.7.3).  This is in the context of the 
accepted effectiveness of NAIs in treatment of complicated influenza as reflected by the public health 
guidelines and the data used in support of public health guidelines. IV zanamivir was initiated as a 
response to the need of an IV formulation to be used in hospitals when resistant strains to oseltamivir 
circulate.  Importantly, the different resistance pattern of zanamivir and oseltamivir could make 
zanamivir an important medicinal product to be used in situations where strains resistant to oseltamivir 
are circulating or emerge during treatment.   
Given the lack of conclusive efficacy data from randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials for any 
neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) in complicated influenza, the CHMP sought the inputs of experts (Scientific 
Advisory Group- SAG) on the available efficacy data for IV zanamivir to support a favourable benefit-risk 
conclusion in the context of a MAA under exceptional circumstances. The SAG acknowledged the 
deficiencies in the current evidence base for the efficacy of NAIs in the treatment of hospitalised influenza 
patients but were unanimous in their view that the available evidence from observational studies and 
meta-analyses was adequate to recommend the use of NAIs in the treatment of hospitalised influenza 
patients. In addition, the SAG agreed that based on the comparability of IV zanamivir and other NAIs in 
in vitro, in vivo, human challenge studies and the results of the pivotal study NAI114373, it was 
reasonable to expect that zanamivir IV would have a similar efficacy to oseltamivir in hospitalised 
influenza patients.  
Based on the above, it is accepted that there is a reasonable expectation of benefit for the use of 
zanamivir IV in hospitalized influenza patients particularly those who do not have other appropriate 
anti-viral agents either due to the resistant pattern of the influenza virus or due to other practical/safety 
reasons.  
The safety profile has been reasonably characterized and the available data do not raise any major 
concerns. Therefore, the benefit-risk analysis for the use of zanamivir IV (Dectova) in the treatment of 
hospitalised influenza patients for whom patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to 
anti-influenza medicinal products other than zanamivir, and/or other anti-viral medicinal products for 
treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are not suitable for the individual patient, is 
considered to be positive. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 136/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As argued above, oseltamivir, the comparator used in the pivotal study has recognised efficacy in 
uncomplicated influenza and is the standard of care in complicated influenza, although the evidence in 
complicated influenza is from observational studies/meta-analyses rather than from randomized, 
placebo-controlled studies. Based on the results of the pivotal study, comparable efficacy of Zanamivir IV 
can be inferred.  
Based on the in-vitro viral susceptibility profile, Zanamivir IV is expected to have efficacy in patients with 
complicated and life-threatening influenza who are infected with influenza virus resistant to other 
neuraminidase inhibitors including oseltamivir 
In addition, given that zanamivir IV is expected to have the same exposure in patients who are unable to 
take other NAIs, efficacy can be anticipated in this patient population. 
In order to get a better insight, the applicant commits to conduct post-approval studies to evaluate the 
effectiveness (and safety) of zanamivir in the post-authorisation setting. 
The applicant describes plans for two post-authorisation effectiveness studies, as a specific obligation:  
1. 
A retrospective observational chart review study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of 
treatment with zanamivir 10 mg/ml solution for infusion in a cohort of intensive care unit-treated (ICU) 
patients with influenza infection.  The primary objective is to compare all-cause in-hospital mortality in a 
group of ICU admitted patients with influenza who receive treatment with zanamivir IV as part of their 
clinical care with all-cause mortality in-hospital mortality in a propensity score-matched group of ICU 
patients who did not receive this therapy during the same influenza seasons and/or pandemic(s). 
It is the opinion of the CHMP that it is challenging to obtain unbiased effectiveness data from such a 
patient population, but it is acknowledged that a prospective study may be difficult under current 
circumstances and therefore the design and plans for data analysis are considered relevant and 
supported.  
2. 
A prospective study will be initiated when certain criteria related to increased use of zanamavir IV 
are met.  Examples of such conditions being when European Public Health Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
the treatment of influenza recommend the early or first line use of IV zanamivir, such as during a severe 
influenza pandemic or when there is influenza known to be resistant to other antivirals than zanamivir 
widely circulating in the European Union as reported by the European Reference Laboratory Network for 
Human Influenza (ERLI-Net). 
The applicant will seek Scientific Advice soon following receipt of the Marketing authorisation, regarding 
design and criteria for initiation of this prospective, observational study. 
Additional data on safety will be provided by routine pharmacovigilance. However, a pregnancy registry is 
proposed to systematically collect more information on safety in pregnant women. This registry should be 
established from the time of marketing authorisation. 
There is no important safety concern requiring additional risk minimisation measures for the moment. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available and is not considered feasible to generate such 
data, a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances was requested by the applicant in the 
initial submission.  
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 137/143 
 
 
  
  
 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use based on all three grounds: 
the proposed indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to 
provide comprehensive evidence; there is an inability to provide comprehensive information due to the 
present state of scientific knowledge; and it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical 
ethics to collect required information  
The following arguments were carefully considered and supported by CHMP:  
• 
Influenza virus that is resistant to other approved anti-influenza medications occurs so rarely that 
it is not feasible to conduct clinical studies in this patient population.   
•  Currently, there is a significant gap in the scientific knowledge:  
o 
o 
Lack of data from placebo-controlled studies to quantify the benefit of current standard of 
care and consequent inability to derive conclusive evidence from a non-inferiority study  
Lack of correlation of virologic and clinical responses which prevent use of biomarkers or 
surrogate endpoints to measure efficacy 
• 
It is not feasible to conduct controlled clinical studies in a patient population who can only be 
administered anti-influenza medication via the IV route as there are no anti-influenza IV 
medications approved for hospitalised patients in the European Union. It would be unethical to 
conduct a placebo-controlled study in this extremely sick patient population who have 
complicated and potentially life threatening influenza 
1. Rarity  
Since the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009, the global incidence of oseltamivir resistant virus 
has remained low, ranging from 0.8%-1.6%% in 2011-2014 based on data from the WHO [Lackenby, 
2011; Takashita, 2015]. Based on an analysis of 10,641 influenza viruses circulating globally in 
2013-2014, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria or B/Yamagata-lineage viruses with 
reduced or highly reduced susceptibility was low, on the order of 1.6%, 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.1% 
respectively to one or more of the NAIs tested (including oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and 
laninamivir) [Takashita, 2015].  
In the Phase III study, 1potential resistant virus from 1 subject in the 300 mg IV zanamivir arm with NA 
substitutions T325I emerged during treatment. There was no resistance detected in subjects in the 600 
mg IV zanamivir arm in the Phase III study. Six subjects in the oseltamivir arm of the Phase III study 
selected virus with known resistance substitutions, D198D/G, R292R/K and 4 with the most common 
oseltamivir resistance substitution H275Y. Resistance to zanamivir during treatment is rare and has only 
been previously reported in 9 immunocompromised patients and 1 immunocompetent paediatric patient. 
While the occurrence in 2007 to 2009 of widespread oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) virus carrying the 
H275Y substitution demonstrates the real and significant threat of an epidemic of oseltamivir-resistant 
virus, such a strain has not yet emerged in the postpandemic period. To conduct a clinical study 
exclusively in subjects with oseltamivir resistant virus would therefore not be feasible if the incidence 
remains at the rates observed during the most recent pandemic and post-pandemic period. 
The rarity of patients in the approved indication (resistance and /or other antivirals including inhaled 
zanamivir not suitable to the individual patient) prevent the conduct of confirmatory studies in this 
specific population. 
EMA/CHMP/851480/2018 
Page 138/143 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
2. Inability to provide comprehensive information due to the present state of scientific knowledge 
There is a lack of data from placebo-controlled studies to quantify the benefit of current standard of care 
and inability to derive conclusive evidence from a non-inferiority study.   Imposing a requirement to 
demonstrate superiority against an established active control (standard of care) in the general population 
of hospitalised complicated influenza patients proves unfeasible in the present state of scientific 
knowledge and would likewise be inappropriate for the proposed indication that is limited to patients with 
highest unmet needs.  
3. Inability to collect such information because it would be contrary to medical ethics 
All approved influenza antivirals have demonstrated efficacy in placebo-controlled studies in the setting of 
acute uncomplicated influenza illness in which mild illness in healthy outpatients presents a different 
benefit-risk assessment.  
Due to the standard practice of prescribing NAIs for treatment of hospitalised patients with 
severe/complicated influenza and the substantial associated morbidity/mortality associated with the 
illness, the conduct of a placebo-controlled study is considered difficult even in patients with influenza 
viruses that are not resistant to other NAIs. Given the lack of data from placebo-controlled studies to 
document the benefit of other NAIs like oseltamivir, a conclusive non-inferiority study against other NAIs 
like oseltamivir is also not feasible, as appropriate non-inferiority margins cannot be ascertained. 
According to the recent ECDC Expert Opinion on NAIs [ECDC, 2016], 
“All EU Member States recommend NAIs, in combination with clinical supportive care, for treatment of 
severe, complicated or progressive illness, or for patients at high risk of complications, irrespective of 
vaccination status. Furthermore, influenza antivirals are being used for treatment and prophylaxis of 
severe influenza disease caused by zoonotic influenza strains”, further stating that “national 
recommendations regarding influenza antiviral use are available in 24 EU/EEA Member States. These 
policies generally recommend use of antivirals for patients with severe or progressive influenza requiring 
hospitalization”. 
These recommendations are generally aligned to guidance from the WHO Guidance on use of 
Pharmacologic Management of Pandemic Influenza and support NAIs as the widely accepted standard of 
care in the clinical management of patients hospitalised with severe/complicated influenza illness. 
Therefore, even if it were possible to conduct a randomised controlled clinical study whilst drug-resistant 
influenza virus was in circulation, it would not be ethical to conduct a placebo-controlled study due to the 
issues described above. 
The totality of the above limitations prevents generation of comprehensive data for Dectova. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dectova in the presently sought indication is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Dectova is favourable in the following indication: 
“Dectova is indicated for the treatment of complicated and potentially life-threatening influenza A or B 
virus infection in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months) when: 
• 
The patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to anti-influenza medicinal 
products other than zanamivir, and/or 
•  Other anti-viral medicinal products for treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are 
not suitable for the individual patient. 
Dectova should be used in accordance with official guidance.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions:

Divergent position to the majority recommendation

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 February 2019 
DECTOVA EMEA/H/C/004102/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of DECTOVA indicated for “the treatment of complicated 
and potentially life-threatening influenza A or B virus infection in adult and paediatric patients (aged 
≥6 months) when: 
• 
The patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to anti-influenza medicinal 
products other than zanamivir, and/or 
•  Other anti-viral medicinal products for treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are 
not suitable for the individual patient. 
Dectova should be used in accordance with official guidance.” 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Dectova was compared to oseltamivir in the randomised NAI114373 study, in hospitalised adults with 
influenza. This trial showed no significant difference in the clinical efficacy of Dectova and oseltamivir. 
Since it is unknown whether oseltamivir is efficacious in the studied population and what might be the 
magnitude of any such effect, superiority would have been required to established efficacy. 
The  marketing  authorisation  for  Dectova  in  the  abovementioned  population  would  be  under 
“exceptional circumstances”. According to the Guideline on procedures for the granting of a marketing 
authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances,  pursuant  to  article  14  (8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004,  such  a  marketing  authorisation  may  be  granted  if  it  is  not  possible  to  provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications 
for  which  the  product  in  question  is  intended  are  encountered  so  rarely  that  the  applicant  cannot 
reasonably  be  expected  to  provide  comprehensive  evidence;  or  in  the  present  state  of  scientific 
knowledge,  comprehensive  information  cannot  be  provided;    or  it  would  be  contrary  to  generally 
accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information 
While it may be agreed that for the particular conditions encompassed by the indication, it would not be 
anticipated that a direct demonstration of efficacy would be presented, this would neither be the only 
nor, arguably, the standard way of generating relevant efficacy data. 
In  order  to  establish  efficacy  in  patients  infected  with  virus  known  or  suspected  to  be  resistant  to 
anti-influenza medicinal products other than zanamivir, an efficacy demonstration of Dectova using a 
relevant comparator in patients with virus susceptible to both Dectova and the comparator could have 
been bridged to patients with virus susceptible only to zanamivir. 
Similarly, in order to establish efficacy in patients for whom other anti-viral  medicinal products for 
treatment  of  influenza  are  not  suitable,  an  efficacy  demonstration  of  Dectova  using  a  relevant 
comparator  in  patients  for  whom  both  Dectova  and  the  comparator  are  suitable,  could  have  been 
bridged to those only suitable for Dectova, provided that exposure to zanamivir was similar. 
In  summary,  efficacy  has  not  been  demonstrated;  furthermore,  the  provision  of  a  marketing 
authorisation under “exceptional circumstances” is inappropriate insofar as what is lacking is a relevant 
demonstration of efficacy, rather than the possibility of providing a relevant demonstration of efficacy.

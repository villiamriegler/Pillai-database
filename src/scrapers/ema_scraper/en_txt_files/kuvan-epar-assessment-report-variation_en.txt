To assess Kuvan safety in responsive patients with PKU after 6 weeks of treatment. 
Study design 
Open-label non-comparative phase III trial to evaluate the degree and frequency of response to 
and safety of Kuvan. 
Study population /Sample size 
108 Outpatients of 4 to 18 years of age with hyperphenylalaninaemia due to phenylketonuria and 
with blood phenylalanine level at screening ≥ 450 μmol/L, screened for a planned participation of 
90. 
Treatments 
Kuvan, manufactured by Merck KGaA and Co, Spittal an der Drau, Austria. 
100 mg soluble tablets of sapropterin dihydrochloride. 
The drug was administered orally once a day in the morning with food. Before administration the 
tablet is was to be dissolved in 120-240 ml of water and taken within 15-20 minutes after it was 
dissolved. 
Drug dose was 20 mg/kg/day. Dose adjustment was not planned during the treatment course. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
Primary endpoint: 
Response to Kuvan after 8-day treatment defined as a reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥ 30% 
compared to beginning of the test prior to dosing. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Percentage change of blood Phe level after 8-day Kuvan therapy (response test period) compared 
to Phe level at the beginning of the test prior to dosing 
In the overall subject population; 
In the sub-population of subjects who responded to Kuvan. 
Safety: 
Incidence and description of adverse events 
In the sub-population of subjects who responded to Kuvan; 
In the overall subject population. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed for the intention to treat (ITT) population. For 
qualitative endpoints absolute number, relative frequency (proportion) and exact (Clopper- 
Pearson) two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for proportion were calculated. For quantitative 
endpoints the arithmetical mean, two-sided 95% CI for the mean value, median, minimum and 
maximum were calculated.

Safety analysis was performed in the safety population. Adverse events (AE) were classified using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 16.0. The safety analysis was 
performed for the entire sample, and for the responders’ sub-population. 
The analysis of the AEs including the serious AE (SAE), included defining the total number of AEs, 
total number of subjects with AE, number of treatment-related AEs, number of AEs resulted in 
treatment discontinuation, number of withdrawals from the trial at the subject’s initiative. Results 
were presented in a descriptive way. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
One hundred eight (110) subjects were screened. The trial included 90 subjects with PKU. 30 
subjects responded to treatment and continued participation in the trial. One subject refused to 
participate in the trial due to a reason not related to AE. No withdrawals due to AE occurred. 
Baseline data 
Blood Phe level (mean of two measurements) was 782.2 ± 222.6 μmol/L. 43 (47.8%) subjects 
had blood Phe level ≥ 600 and < 900 μmol/L. There were no clinically significant deviations from 
normal ranges in haematology, biochemistry; one clinically significant case of red blood cells in 
urine was revealed at screening visit. Pregnancy test was performed to 8 females; in all cases it 
was negative. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 30 (33.3%) subjects responded to 8-days treatment (95%CI: 23.7; 
44.1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: The mean percentage change in blood Phe level after 8-days 
response test period compared to baseline was 14.1 ± 28.4% in overall subject population 
(95%CI: 8.2; 20.1) and 44.3 ± 15.1% in the sub-population of responders (95%CI: 38.6; 49.9). 
Safety results 
Safety analysis included 90 subjects. Thirty four AEs occurred in 24 (26.7%) subjects. In the sub-
population of responders 25 AEs occurred in 16 (53.3%) subjects. 
Two (5.9%) AEs were related to the investigational drug based on the Investigator’s judgment in 
the overall population and 2 (8.0%) AEs were related to the investigational drug in the 
subpopulation of responders. Other AEs were not related to the investigational drug. 
Most AEs, 30 (88.2%) in overall population and 21 (84.0%) AEs in the sub-population of 
responders, were mild; other AEs were moderate. 
Eighteen (52.9%) AEs required concomitant medications administration, one (2.9%) AE required 
surgical treatment and 15 (44.1%) AEs did not require any intervention. In the subpopulation of 
responders, 9 (36.0%) AEs required medications administration, one (4.0%) AE required surgical 
treatment and 15 (60.0%) AEs did not require any intervention. 
Seven (20.6%) AEs in overall population and 7 (28.0%) AEs in the sub-population of responders 
were ongoing at the termination of a subject’s participation in the trial. Other AEs (79.4% and 
72.0%) terminated before the end of subjects’ participation in the trial. 
Twenty five (73.5%) AEs in overall population and 19 (76.0%) AEs in the sub-population of 
responders did not require changing the dose of Kuvan.

In the overall population 27 (79.4%) AEs completely resolved; 5 (14.7%) AEs not resolved and 2 
(5.9%) AEs resolved with sequelae. In the sub-population of responders 19 (76.0%) AEs 
completely resolved; 5 (20.0%) AEs not resolved and 1 (4.0%) AEs resolved with sequelae. 
Overall rate of SAE in this trial was 1.1%. This one SAE was not related to the investigational drug. 
There were no cases of early withdrawal from the trial due to AE. One subject refused to 
participate in the trial due to a reason not related to AE. 
Most common systems of organs with AEs were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(13.3% in overall population and 20.0% in responders), gastrointestinal disorders (3.3% and 
10.0%); renal and urinary disorders (4.4% and 13.3%); vascular disorders (3.3% and 10.0%). 
Most common AEs were respiratory tract infection viral (10.0% in overall population and 13.3% in 
responders), retinal vascular disorder (2.2% and 6.7%), phenylalaninaemia (2.2% and 6.7%). 
No clinically significant changes in the parameters of complete blood count and blood chemistry 
test were observed. One case of clinically significant red blood cells in urine was revealed at 
screening visit; one such case of white blood cells in urine was revealed at Follow-up visit. There 
were no clinically significant changes in other parameters of urinalysis. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, 30 (33.3%) subjects responded to 8-days treatment (95%CI: 
23.7; 44.1). For Secondary efficacy endpoints, the mean percentage change in blood Phe level 
after 8-days response test period compared to baseline was 14.1 ± 28.4% in overall subject 
population (95%CI: 8.2; 20.1) and 44.3 ± 15.1% in the sub-population of responders (95%CI: 
38.6; 49.9). 
The safety of Kuvan in Study EMR700773_510 was assessed by the type, frequency and intensity 
of adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, total number of AEs, total number of 
subjects with AE, number of treatment-related AEs, number of AEs resulting treatment 
discontinuation, number of withdrawals from the trial. 
Safety analysis included 90 subjects. Thirty four AEs occurred in 24 (26.7%) subjects. In the sub-
population of responders 25 AEs occurred in 16 (53.3%) subjects. 
Kuvan was generally well-tolerated in subjects 4-18 years (inclusive). There were no deaths 
during the study and no subjects withdrew from the study or permanently discontinued treatment 
due to an AE. 
Two (5.9%) AEs were related to the investigational drug based on the Investigator’s judgement in 
overall population and 2 (8.0%) AEs were related to the investigational drug in the subpopulation 
of responders. Other AEs were not related to the investigational drug. 
Most AEs, 30 (88.2%) in overall population and 21 (84.0%) AEs in the sub-population of 
responders, were mild; other AEs were moderate. 
Eighteen (52.9%) AEs required concomitant medications administration, one (2.9%) AE required 
surgical treatment and 15 (44.1%) AEs did not require any intervention. In the subpopulation of 
responders, 9 (36.0%) AEs required medications administration, one (4.0%) AE required surgical 
treatment and 15 (60.0%) AEs did not require any intervention. 
Overall rate of SAE in this trial was 1.1%. This one SAE was not related to the investigational drug.

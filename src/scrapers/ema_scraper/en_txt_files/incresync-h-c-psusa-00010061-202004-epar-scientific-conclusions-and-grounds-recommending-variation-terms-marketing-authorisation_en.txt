Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, 
alogliptin / pioglitazone, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on bullous pemphigoid and interstitial nephritis from the literature and 
spontaneous reports, a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in 
view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between alogliptin 
and bullous pemphigoid and interstitial nephritis is at least a reasonable possibility/established. The 
PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, 
alogliptin / pioglitazone should be amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, alogliptin / pioglitazone 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 
alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, alogliptin / pioglitazone is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

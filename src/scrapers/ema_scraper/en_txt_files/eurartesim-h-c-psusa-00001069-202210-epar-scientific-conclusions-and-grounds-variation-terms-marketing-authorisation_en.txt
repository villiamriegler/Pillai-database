Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for artenimol / piperaquine 
tetraphosphate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on hepatocellular injury from spontaneous reports in adults including in some 
cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship 
between artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate and hepatocellular injury is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing artenimol / 
piperaquine tetraphosphate should be amended accordingly.
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing artenimol / piperaquine 
tetraphosphate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

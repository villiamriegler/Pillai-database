The procedure started on 18 June 1996. 
During  the  15-18  July  1996  CPMP  meeting,  a  GMP  inspection  of  the  manufacturing  site  in 
Puerto Rico was agreed upon. 
The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on 
23 August 1996. The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members 
on 26 and 27 August 1996. 
An  addendum  to  the  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP 
Members on 11 October 1996. 
During  the  meeting  on  14-17  October  1996,  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of 
questions  to  be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the 
company on 17 October 1996. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 4 March 1997. 
The  Rapporteur  and  the  Co-Rapporteur  circulated  the  joint  response  assessment  report  on  the 
company’s responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 17 April 1997. 
A  hearing  was  held  at  the  CPMP  meeting  on  13  May  1997,  to  address  the  remaining 
outstanding  issues  (therapeutic  indication,  long-term  efficacy,  retinal  degeneration  and  gender 
differences with respect to dyskinesia). 
The  CPMP,  during its  meeting  on 17-18 June  1997  discussed  the  recommendations  presented 
by  the  Rapporteur,  considering  the  responses  provided  by  the  company  were  satisfactory. 
Amendments  were  discussed  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  on  the  Therapeutic 
Indication and Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use and Package Leaflet texts. 
During the meeting on 17-18 June 1997 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and 
the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a 
Marketing Authorisation to Mirapexin on 18 June 1997. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the

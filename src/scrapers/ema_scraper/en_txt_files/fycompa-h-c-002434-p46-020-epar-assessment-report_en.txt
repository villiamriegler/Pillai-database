1.  Introduction 
Perampanel is a highly selective non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist. In the EU, 
Fycompa  (perampanel),  following  the  recent  extension  of  indication  in  the  paediatric  population 
(EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047), is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of: 
- 
partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 
years of age and older. 
- 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). 
Perampanel  has  also  been  approved  as  monotherapy  or  adjunctive  therapy  in  pediatric  patients  with 
POS aged 4 years and older in the US as of September 2018. The International Birth Date is 23 July 
2012  in  the  EU  (via  the  centralized  procedure).  Perampanel  is  marketed  under  the  trade  name 
Fycompa and is available as 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-mg tablets and 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension. 
With  this  post-authorisation  measure  (PAM)  EISAI  is  hereby  submitting  final  study  results  and  report 
related to paediatric population in line with Article 46 of paediatric regulation 1901/2006, as amended, 
for  Study  E2007-J000-335  (Study  335).  Study  335  was  a  phase  3,  multicentre,  randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with an open-label extension phase in adults and 
adolescents  aged  12  years  and  older  who  had  a  diagnosis  of  inadequately  controlled  partial-onset 
seizures. The study was conducted in Australia, China, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (4, 8, 12 mg/day of perampanel, or placebo) in 
a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The study randomised 710 subjects (planned 680 subjects, 170 subjects per treatment 
group) into the Core phase, 73 of whom were less than 18 years of age.  
The  primary  objective of  Study  335  was  to  confirm  the  efficacy  of  perampanel  (4,  8,  and  12  mg) 
compared to placebo given as an adjunctive therapy in subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  a)  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  perampanel  compared  to 
placebo given as an adjunctive therapy in subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures, b) to evaluate 
the long-term maintenance effect of perampanel (4, 8, and 12 mg) given as an adjunctive therapy in 
subjects  with  refractory  partial-onset  seizures,  c)  and  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of 
perampanel  including  the  effects  of  concomitant  antiepileptic  drugs  (AEDs)  and  to  explore  the 
relationship between PK and efficacy of perampanel. 
This study E2007- J000-335 (Study 335) was completed on 02 Nov 2020. The submission of the final 
clinical  study  report  for  Study  335  is  being  made  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  to  fulfil  the 
obligation to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in a paediatric population. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  Study  E2007-J000-335  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  335),  a 
Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study (Core Study) 
followed  by  the  Extension  Phase  to  confirm  the  efficacy  and  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
perampanel compared to placebo given as an adjunctive therapy in subjects 12 years of age and older 
with refractory partial-onset seizures. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
The phase 3 study was divided into two parts: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Core 
study  and  an  open  label  extension  phase  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  perampanel 
administered as an adjunctive therapy in subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
The primary objective of the study is to confirm the efficacy of perampanel compared to placebo given 
as an adjunctive therapy in subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures  
Secondary Objectives: 
•  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  perampanel  compared  to  placebo  given  as  an  adjunctive 
therapy in subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures 
•  To  evaluate  the  long-term  maintenance  effect  of  perampanel  given  as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in 
subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures 
•  To  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  perampanel  including  the  effects  of  concomitant 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and to explore the relationship between PK and efficacy of perampanel. 
Study design 
Study  335  has  been  designed  to  confirm  the  efficacy  of  perampanel  and  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
tolerability  of  perampanel  prescribed  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  epilepsy  in  Australia,  China, 
Korea, Japan and Malaysia. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (4, 8, 12 mg/day of 
perampanel, or placebo) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The figure below represents the overall study design:

a: Depending on the requirements in each country, the Maintenance Period of the Extension Phase was to be terminated within 3 
months from the launch date of perampanel in the country or at Week 75, whichever is later. 
CHMP comment:  
The Core  randomized  study consisted of 2 phases: prerandomization (6 weeks) and randomization 
(19 weeks). The randomization phase consisted of 2 periods: titration (6 weeks) and maintenance (13 
weeks). During the prerandomization phase, subjects were assessed for their eligibility to participate, 
including seizure frequency. Once all eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion criteria met, subjects 
entered the randomization phase. 
The subjects were prestratified based on country and concomitant AEDs. Inducer AEDs are defined as 
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, vs non-inducer AED.  
They were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment groups (4, 8, 12 mg/day of perampanel, or placebo).  
During  the  titration  period,  the  dose  was  increased  at  weekly  intervals  in  increments  of  2  mg  to  a 
target dose of 4, 8, or 12 mg.  
During the maintenance period, subjects entered this period on the last dose they achieved at the end 
of  the  titration  period  and  continued  taking  this  dose  level  once  daily  at  bedtime  until  end  of  study. 
Adjustment of the study drug dose level during this period was not recommended. However, according 
to the investigator’s clinical judgment, subjects experiencing intolerable AEs were allowed to have their 
dose reduced and increased again if tolerated.  
For both periods, subjects who could not tolerate 2 mg dose were discontinued from the study. 
The extension study included subjects who completed the Core study. The extension phase consisted 
of  3  periods:  preconversion  (4  weeks,  where  subjects  continued  taking  the  same  dose  level  as  they 
took in the  maintenance  period of  the  Core  Study  in  a  blinded  manner),  conversion  (6  weeks,  where 
subjects  previously  assigned  to  the  placebo  group  in  the  Core  Study,  began  receiving  perampanel  2 
mg/day in a blinded manner and were up-titrated in weekly 2-mg increments to a maximum of 12 mg

of  perampanel  or  until  an  optimal  dose  was  found),  and  maintenance  (46  weeks  or  longer,  where 
subjects were maintained with the perampanel dose that provided the optimal combination of efficacy 
and  tolerability).  A  Follow-up  visit  was  conducted  4  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  perampanel  was 
administered. 
Overall,  adjustment  of  the  study  drug  dose  level  during  this  maintenance  period  was  not 
recommended.  However,  according  to  the  investigator’s  clinical  judgment,  subjects  experiencing 
intolerable AEs were allowed to have their dose reduced if needed.  
Study population /Sample size 
The study planned to enrol 680 patients (170 subjects per treatment group).  
Subjects were eligible for participation in the study if they were aged 12 years and older, with a clinical 
diagnosis of epilepsy with partial seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures and who had 
been  treated  for  at  least  12  weeks  but  confirmed  to  be  uncontrolled  with  more  than  1  standard  AED 
within the 2 years before Visit 1. 
Randomized:  710  subjects  (177in  the  placebo  group,  176  in the  perampanel 4  mg  group,  177 in  the 
perampanel 8 mg group, 180 in the perampanel 12 mg group).  
Completed  the  Core  Study:  599  subjects  (152  in  the  placebo  group,  156  in  the  perampanel  4  mg 
group, 147 in the perampanel 8 mg group, 144 in the perampanel 12 mg group).  
Discontinued from the Core Study: 108 subjects. 
Entered the Extension Phase: 596 subjects.  
Sample  size  rationale:  it  was  assumed  that  in  comparison  to  the  prerandomization  phase,  subjects 
would show a percent reduction in seizure frequency of 10% in the placebo treatment group and 30% 
in the 8 mg treatment group in the randomization phase of the ITT Analysis Set. Therefore, a sample 
size  of  170  subjects  for  each  treatment  group  in  the  ITT  Analysis  Set  would  have  more  than  80% 
power  to  detect  a  treatment  difference  in  seizure  frequency  change  of  20%  (assuming  a  common 
standard  deviation  of  62%)  between  placebo  and  each  of  the  active  treatment  groups  based  on 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a 0.05 2-sided significance level. 
CHMP comment:  
The  patients  were  selected  to  receive  Fycompa  as  an  adjunctive  treatment  starting  at  Visit  1.  The 
patients should also be treated with stable doses of 1, 2, or a maximum of 3 approved AEDs (only 1 
inducer AED was allowed; i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin, or oxcarbazepine). 
The discontinuation rate from the Core study is rather acceptable (15%). The number of patients that 
entered  the  extension  study  (596)  is  nearly  equivalent  to  the number of  patients  that  completed  the 
Core study (599) at week 19.  
Treatments 
Fycompa was taken as a single oral dose taken once daily before bedtime. Perampanel was supplied as 
2-mg tablets. Treatment was initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day as approved in the PIL.  
Comparator  drug:  Placebo  was  supplied  as  matching  perampanel  2-mg  tablets.  Perampanel-matched 
placebo was also taken as a single oral dose taken once daily before bedtime.

The planned duration of treatment in this study was 75 weeks or longer. The duration of treatment in 
the Core study was 19 weeks and the planned total duration of treatment in the extension phase was a 
minimum of 56 weeks (for more details of each period, see table 1 above). 
CHMP comment:  
The  dose  was  increased  based  on  clinical  response  and  tolerability  by  increments  of  2  mg/day  to  a 
maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day for at least 19 weeks or until 75 weeks if entering and 
completing the extension study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
Efficacy:  
-  Percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28-days:  the  seizure  frequency  and  percent  change  from 
baseline  in  seizure  frequency  from  the  randomization  phase  until  the  maintenance  period  of  the 
extension phase were summarized using descriptive statistics. 
- Response rate: the number (percentage) of responder (ie, subjects who had at least a 50% reduction 
in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  relative  to  baseline)  from  the  randomization  phase  until  the 
maintenance period of the extension phase was summarized. 
•  Safety:  
- All Adverse Events (AEs) including Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). 
-  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  (AESI)  such  as  Medication  Errors,  Lack  of  Therapeutic  Efficacy, 
Overdose, Abuse, Misuse, Off Label Use, Pregnancy and exposure to drug during breast feeding. 
-  TEAE:  the  incidence  of  TEAEs,  treatment-related  TEAEs,  serious  TEAEs,  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation,  TEAEs  leading  to  dose  reduction,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  interruption  was 
summarized by SOC and PT, by maximum severity of TEAEs, by the time point of first onset of TEAEs 
and by the mean daily dose of perampanel.  
CHMP comment:  
The following assessments / procedures were carried out during the 75 weeks treatment period: 
-  Efficacy:  The  seizure  counts  and  seizure  types  were  recorded  on  the  diary  and  by  the  investigator 
and  this  allows  the  assessment  of  the  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  and  the 
responder rate. 
-  Safety:  Examining  and  recording  number  and  details  of  AEs,  withdrawal  from  treatment,  AESI  and 
TEAE. Other safety findings like clinical laboratory tests (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), vital 
signs,  weight,  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  Columbia-Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  (C-SSRS) 
were also recorded for assessment. 
Efficacy is the primary endpoint and safety the secondary. 
Two other outcomes were summarized in the CSR using descriptive statistics although not detailed in 
this  report:  Complex  partial  seizure  and  secondary  generalized  seizure  frequency  and  the  Clinical 
Global Impression of Change. A focus is made on the main efficacy criteria. 
Furthermore,  subgroup  analyses  for  the  seizure  frequency  and  50%  responder  rate  were  performed 
using  the  following  subgroups:  1)  country  (Japan/China/Korea/Other),  2)  baseline  concomitant  AEDs 
(inducer  [carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine/phenytoin/overall],  noninducer),  3)  Japan  and  concomitant 
AEDs. This is not detailed in this report. These subgroup analyses are not displayed in this report.

Statistical Methods 
The  Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  Analysis  Set  included  all  subjects  who  signed  informed  consent,  were 
randomized,  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication,  and  had  at  least  1  post  dose  seizure 
frequency data. 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT Analysis Set. The results for the ITT Analysis Set were 
summarized by treatment group assigned in the randomization phase and by active treatment groups 
in the extension phase.  
The Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who signed informed consent, were randomized, received 
at least 1 dose of perampanel, and had at least 1 post dose safety assessment.  
CHMP comment:  
The statistical methods are acceptable for the Core study and extension phase.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Table 1 extracted from the CSR displays the subject disposition and primary reason for discontinuation 
from the extension phase.  
In total, 596 subjects entered the extension phase: 151 subjects in the placebo group, 156 subjects in 
the  perampanel  4  mg  group,  146  subjects  in  the  perampanel  8  mg  group,  and  143  subjects  in  the 
perampanel 12 mg group.

CHMP comment:  
The study was conducted at 119 sites in Australia (7 sites), China (22 sites), Korea (14 sites), Japan 
(61 sites), Malaysia (5 sites), Taiwan (5 sites), and Thailand (5 sites). 
Of  the  596  subjects,  196  completed  the  extension  Phase  and  400  were  discontinued  from  the 
extension  phase.  Overall,  the  most  common  primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  the  extension 
phase  were  subject  choice  (24.2%),  inadequate  therapeutic  effect  (16.8%),  AE  (10.6%),  and  other 
(10.4%).  400  subjects  that  discontinued  the  study  represents  two  thirds  (67%)  of  all  participants  at 
week 75. Regarding the high rate of discontinuation, any conclusion based on these end-of-study data 
could not be considered as reliable. 
Baseline data 
Table  1  extracted  from  the  CO  summarizes  the  demography,  baseline  characteristics,  and  epilepsy-
specific medical history for the Safety Analysis Set.

table 3 
CHMP comment:  
Baseline  demographic  characteristics  and  epilepsy-specific  medical  history  were  balanced  across  the 
treatment groups. Most (88.1%) of the 704 subjects in the ITT Analysis Set were 18 to 64 years old. 
There were 74 (10.5%) subjects less than 18 years old, and 10 (1.4%) subjects were 65 years of age. 
The  mean  ±  SD  age  was  33.4±13.22  years.  Overall,  48.9%  of  the  subjects  were  male.  The  highest 
percentage  of  subjects  by  country  was  35.5%  in  Japan.  Korea  and  China  were  nearly  similar  with 
23.7%  and  25.6%.  The  median  time  since  diagnosis  was  182.00  months  (range:  8.0,  666.0)  i.e. 
around 15 years.  
Complex partial seizures were the most common seizure type (85.4%) whereas simple partial seizures 
without motor signs were the less common seizure type (25.5%). 
Regarding the concomitant medications, all subjects were taking AEDs at baseline. Of all the subjects, 
over 50% were taking 3 AEDs and approximately 67% were taking at least 1 inducing AED at baseline. 
(43.7%  for  carbamazepine,  13.8%  for  oxcarbazepine,  and  9.7%  for  phenytoin).  The  most  common 
non-inducing  AEDs  used  at  baseline  were  valproic  acid  (41.4%),  levetiracetam  (40.8%),  and 
lamotrigine (27.2%). 
The paediatrics (< 18 years of age) are underrepresented, which undermines the validity of the study 
in this age cohort. No firm conclusion concerning this age group is therefore possible.

Pharmacokinetic results 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set included subjects who had at least 1 evaluable plasma concentration. 
Of all randomized subjects (710 subjects), 1 subject was excluded from the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Set because the subject received an incorrect study drug kit.  
A total of 709 subjects (placebo group, n = 176; perampanel 4 mg group, n = 176; perampanel 8 mg 
group, n = 177; and perampanel 12 mg group, n = 180) were included. 
Core Study 
Summaries  of  plasma  perampanel  concentrations  by  treatment  group  except  for  placebo  group  are 
summarized  for  population  PK  and  PK/PD  analysis.  The  details  were  described  in  the  separately 
prepared analysis plan and its report. 
Extension Phase 
PK assessments were not performed during the Extension Phase. 
CHMP comment:  
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of perampanel including the effects of concomitant antiepileptic 
drugs (AEDs) and to explore the relationship between PK and efficacy of perampanel was defined as a 
secondary endpoint of this study. However, the PK results are not submitted in an assessable format. 
As  these  data  were  previously  submitted  and  discussed  for  assessment  of  PK  data  in  adults  and 
adolescents, this concern is not pursued. 
Efficacy results 
The  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  Analysis  Set  (704  subjects)  was  the  primary  analysis  set  used  for  efficacy 
analyses.  Of  all  randomized  subjects  (710  subjects),  6  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  ITT  Analysis 
Set  because  they  did  not  receive  any  study  drug  or  did  not  have  any  post-dose  seizure  data.  There 
was a total of 74 subjects aged 12 to < 18 years (Placebo group, n = 12; perampanel 4 mg group, n = 
23; perampanel 8 mg group, n = 25; and perampanel 12 mg group, n = 14) in ITT Analysis Set. 
During the study, two main efficacy parameters were evaluated: percent change in seizure frequency 
per 28 days and responder rate.  
1.  Percent Change in Seizure Frequency per 28 Days 
The seizure frequency and percent change from baseline in seizure frequency per 28 days during each 
phase/period  (stratified  by  the  treatment  assigned  in  the  Core  study)  for  the  Core  study  and  the 
extension phase were summarized in table 4:

The median percent changes from baseline in seizure frequency per 28 days during the Core study and 
each period of the extension study (Preconversion Period, Conversion Period, Weeks 30 to 47, Weeks 
48  to  55,  Weeks  56  to  63  and  Weeks  64  to  75)  in  subjects  who  previously  received  placebo  were 
respectively –10.76%, –16.50%, –48.87%, –44.43%, –43.69%, –49.00%, and –47.62%. 
For those patients who previously received perampanel, the median percent changes were respectively 
–26.57%, –36.72%, –43.26%, –46.15%, –53.85%, –52.00%, and –55.93%, respectively. 
When comparing the results according to the perampanel dosing, during the Core study, the treatment 
differences from placebo were statistically significant for the perampanel 8 mg group (p=0.0003) and 
12 mg group (p<0.0001), but not for the perampanel 4 mg group (p=0.2330). 
According  to  the  CO,  it  seems  that  when  focusing  on  the  subanalyses  for  patients  aged  12  to  <  18 
years, the median percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days during the Core study was -9.25% 
in the placebo group, -5.82% in the perampanel 4 mg group, -15.11% in the perampanel 8 mg group, 
and  -63.71%  in  the  perampanel  12  mg  group.  The  median  treatment  differences  from  placebo  were 
estimated  to  be  4.09%,  -12.68%,  and  -51.62%  respectively  for  the  perampanel  4,  8,  and  12  mg 
groups. 
CHMP comment:  
During  the  Core  study,  the  treatment  differences  from  placebo  were  statistically  significant  for  the 
perampanel 8 mg group (p=0.0003) and 12 mg group (p<0.0001), but not for the perampanel 4 mg 
group.  
During  the  extension  phase,  the  median  percent  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  in  the  subjects  who 
previously  received  placebo  changes  similarly  to  that  in  the  subjects  who  previously  received 
perampanel.  The  median  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  shows  that  the  efficacy  of  perampanel 
established in the Core study is maintained throughout the extension phase. This result is however to 
be  considered  cautiously  taking  into  account  the  high  level  of  discontinuation  during  the  extension 
phase (67%). 
For  the  paediatric  subgroup,  the  subanalysis  concluded  that  the  median  treatment  differences  in 
seizure frequency from placebo are weak for the perampanel 4 and 8 mg groups (4.09% and -12.68% 
respectively)  and  rather  high  for  the  perampanel  12  mg  group  (-51.62%).  The  MAH  is  requested  to 
provide  a  detailed  table  with  the  median  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  in 
paediatrics during the Core study and the extension study for each dosage compared to placebo. These 
results should be discussed by the MAH. 
Overall,  these  data  do  not  challenge  the  known  efficacy  results  for  perampanel  in  the  studied 
population, in adults and adolescents. 
2.  Responder Rate 
The  responder  rate  (ie,  subjects  who  had  at  least  a  50%  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days 
relative to baseline) during each phase/period (stratified by the treatment assigned in the Core study) 
for the Core study and the extension phase were summarized in table 5:

Overall,  the  50%  responder  rates  for  all  partial  seizures  during  the  Core  study  were  greater  in  the 
perampanel  4  mg  group  (23.0%),  the  perampanel  8  mg  group  (36.0%)  and  the  perampanel  12  mg 
group (43.3%) than in the placebo group (19.4%). The p values for the differences from placebo were 
0.3954 for the perampanel 4 mg group, 0.0005 for the perampanel 8 mg group, and <0.0001 for the 
perampanel 12 mg group.  
During the extension phase, the 50% responder rates in the subjects who previously received placebo 
changes  similarly  to  that  in  the  subjects  who  previously  received  perampanel.  This  indicated  that 
efficacy established in the Core study was maintained throughout the extension phase. 
According  to  the  CO,  it  seems  that  when  focusing  on  the  subanalyses  for  patients  aged  12  to  <  18 
years, the 50% responder rate for all partial seizures during the Core study was 25.0% in the placebo-
group, 13.0% in the perampanel 4 mg group, 20.0% in the perampanel 8 mg group and 78.6% in the 
perampanel 12 mg group respectively. 
CHMP comment:  
During the Core study, the responder rate is significantly greater in the perampanel 8 mg group (p = 
0.0005)  and  12  mg  group  (p  <  0.0001)  compared  to  placebo  group.  This  result  is  not  significant  for 
the 4 mg group. The responder rate is maintained throughout the extension phase. These data do not 
challenge  the  known  efficacy  results  for  perampanel  in  the  studied  population,  in  adults  and 
adolescents.  This  result  is  however  to  be  considered  cautiously  taking  into  account  the  high  level  of 
discontinuation during the extension phase (67%). 
For  the  paediatric  subgroup,  the  subanalysis  concluded  that  the  responder  rate  is  weaker  for  the 
perampanel 4 and 8 mg groups (13% and 20% respectively) than for placebo (25%) and rather high 
for  the  perampanel  12  mg  group  78.6%).  The  MAH  is  requested  to  provide  a  detailed  table  with  the 
responder rate in paediatrics during the Core study and the extension study for each dosage compared 
to placebo. These results should be discussed by the MAH. 
Overall,  these  data  do  not  challenge  the  known  efficacy  results  for  perampanel  in  the  studied 
population, in adults and adolescents. 
Safety results 
For the safety variables, the data collected during the perampanel treatment in the entire study (Core 
Study plus Extension Phase) were summarized for the Safety Analysis Set.  
Extent of Exposure 
For the Core study, the Safety Analysis Set (707 subjects) included the group of randomized subjects 
who  received  study  drug  and  had  at  least  1  post  baseline  safety  assessment.  Of  all  randomized 
subjects (710 subjects), 3 subjects were excluded from the Safety Analysis Set because they did not 
receive any study drug. Of the 707 subjects, 74 were the subjects aged 12 to <18 years. 
For  the  extension  phase,  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  (679  subjects)  included  the  group  of  randomized 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of perampanel and had at least 1 post dose safety assessment. 
Of  710  randomized  subjects,  31  were  excluded  from  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  because  they  did  not 
receive any dose of perampanel. Of the 679 subjects, 73 were the subjects aged 12 to <18 years. 
Overall, 67.0% of the subjects received perampanel for more than 12 months (336 days). And 41.7% 
of the subjects received perampanel for more than 24 months (672 days). 
Overall, 51.8% of the subjects received a perampanel daily dose of 12 mg at last dose. And the mean 
perampanel dose received is 9.81 mg (SD±2.852).

CHMP comment: 
The Safety Analysis Set is rather substantial for gathering safety long-term data. 
The  actual  administered  daily  doses  are  in  accordance  with  the  dosing  recommendations  already 
approved  in  the  SmPC  for  children  above  12  years  of  age  and  adults  for  the  treatment  of  POS,  in 
conjunction with other AED. 
Adverse events 
Adverse  events  refers  to  TEAEs  (ie,  an  adverse  event  that  emerges  after  study  treatment  initiation 
until  the  last  visit  of  the  study  or  within  30  days  after  the  last  study  treatment).  TEAEs  were 
summarized by SOC and PT for the Safety Analysis Set. 
An overview of TEAE is displayed in table 6:

CHMP comment: 
TEAE occurred in 624 (91.9%) subjects, treatment-related TEAE in 531 (78.2%) subjects and severe 
TEAE in 75 (11.0%) subjects.  
There  were  113  (16.6%)  serious  TEAE,  among  them  7  deaths  (1.0%)  and  104  subjects  requiring 
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (15.3%).  
For  the  TEAE  leading  to  study  drug  dose  adjustment,  most  cases  led  to  a  dose  reduction  for  39%  of 
subjects or to study/drug withdrawal in 20.8% of subjects. 
Summary of TEAE 
Core Study 
•  Common TEAE 
TEAEs  occurred  in  117  subjects  (66.5%)  in  the  placebo  group,  121  subjects  (68.8%)  in  the 
perampanel  4  mg  group,  129  subjects  (73.7%)  in  the  perampanel  8  mg  group,  and  156  subjects 
(86.7%) in the perampanel 12 mg group. The most frequently (≥10%) reported TEAEs were: 
- nasopharyngitis (14.8%) and somnolence (13.1%) in the placebo group;  
-  dizziness,  somnolence,  and  nasopharyngitis  across  all  perampanel  treatment  groups 
(perampanel  4  mg  group,  22.7%,  15.9%  and  13.1%;  perampanel  8  mg  group,  28.6%,  17.7%  and 
13.7%; and perampanel 12 mg group, 42.2%, 17.8% and 12.8%, respectively).  
The  following  TEAEs  occurred  at  a  frequency  of  5%  or  more  and  at  rates  that  were  at  least  twice  as 
high  in  any  of  the  perampanel  groups  as  those  in  the  placebo  group:  dizziness,  irritability,  gait 
disturbance, and rash.  
When focusing on TEAE reported during the Core Study for adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 
<18 years), the most frequently (≥10%) reported TEAEs in adolescent subjects were: 
-  dizziness  (30.4%),  somnolence,  nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(13.0% each) in the perampanel 4 mg group,  
- nasopharyngitis (24.0%), somnolence (16.0%), and dizziness (12.0%), in the perampanel 8 mg 
group,  
-  dizziness  and  somnolence  (35.7%  each),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (21.4%),  and 
weight  increased, blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased and headache (14.3% each) in the 
perampanel 12 mg group.

CHMP comment:  
Dizziness  increases  in  a  dose-dependent  fashion  as  its  occurrence  increases  with  the  perampanel 
dosing groups (22.7% for perampanel 4 mg group, 28.6% for perampanel 8 mg group and 42.2% for 
perampanel 12 mg group). This is confirmed by the PI: “The adverse reactions most commonly (≥ 1% 
in the total perampanel group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and 
somnolence”  and  in  section  4.8  Undesirable  effects  dizziness  is  classified  as  a  very  common  AE  (≥ 
1/10). 
The most frequently (≥10%) reported treatment-related TEAEs were dizziness and somnolence across 
all  perampanel  treatment  groups  (perampanel  4  mg  group,  22.2%  and  15.3%;  perampanel  8  mg 
group,  28.0%  and  17.1%;  and  perampanel  12  mg  group,  40.6%  and  16.7%,  respectively)  as 
compared to the placebo group. No treatment-related TEAE  was reported by ≥10% of the subjects in 
the placebo group.  
•  Deaths 
There  were  a  total  of  2  deaths  during  treatment  or  within  30  days  after  the  last  dose  in  the  Core 
Study,  1  subject  each  in  the  placebo  and  the  perampanel  8  mg  group.  No  death  was  assessed  as 
related to study treatment. There was no death in the 12 to <18 years age group. 
•  Treatment-emergent SAEs 
Treatment-emergent SAEs (including fatalities) occurred in 10 subjects (5.7%) in the placebo group, 6 
subjects (3.4%) in the perampanel 4 mg group, 7 subjects (4.0%) in the perampanel 8 mg group, and 
12 subjects (6.7%) in the perampanel 12 mg group.  
In  the  12  to  <18  years  age  group,  treatment-emergent  SAEs  occurred  in  2  subjects  (14.3%)  in  the 
perampanel 12 mg group.  
With the exception of the 2 subjects who died as a result of a SAE, most subjects recovered from their 
SAE with no sequelae during the Core Study. Most SAEs were considered not related to study drug. 
CHMP comment: 
The  treatment  emergent  SAE  and  the  deaths  that  occurred  in  the  overall  study  are  detailed  in  the 
extension period. 
•  TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study / study drug 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study or study drug occurred in 6 subjects (3.4%) in the placebo 
group, 8 subjects (4.5%) in the perampanel 4 mg group, 20 subjects (11.4%) in the perampanel 8 mg 
group, and 25 subjects (13.9%) in the perampanel 12 mg group. 
In the 12 to <18 years age group, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study or study drug occurred in 
1  subject  (8.3%)  in  the  placebo  group,  1  subject  (4.3%)  in  the  perampanel  4  mg  group,  1  subject 
(4.0%)  in  the  perampanel  8  mg  group,  and  2  subjects  (14.3%)  in  the  perampanel  12  mg  group, 
respectively.  
Overall,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  such  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  perampanel  8  mg  and  12  mg 
groups than in the placebo group. Dizziness was the event that most commonly led to study or study 
drug discontinuation in the perampanel groups compared with the placebo group.

CHMP comment: 
The  results  of  this  core  study  are  in  compliance  with  the  information  displayed  in  the  PI,  i.e.:  “the 
adverse  reactions  most  commonly  (≥  1%  in  the  total  perampanel  group  and  greater  than  placebo) 
leading  to  discontinuation  were  dizziness  and  somnolence”.  Thus  the  safety  data  of  this  core  study 
confirms the known safety profile of perampanel in adults and adolescents. 
Extension Phase 
Summaries  for  the  Extension  Phase  include  only  TEAEs  that  occurred  on  or  after  the  first  day  of 
perampanel treatment in the entire study (Core Study and Extension Phase). 
•  Common TEAE 
The  TEAEs  that  occurred  in  at  least 10%  of  the  subjects  were  dizziness  (46.8%),  nasopharyngitis 
(25.2%),  somnolence  (24.3%),  headache  (13.8%),  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(10.3%).  
The treatment-related TEAEs that occurred in at least 10% of the subjects were dizziness (44.6%) and 
somnolence (23.0%).  
When focusing on TEAE reported during the Core Study for adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 
<18  years),  the  most  frequently  ( ≥ 10%)  reported  TEAEs  in  adolescent  subjects  were 
nasopharyngitis  (35.6%),  dizziness  (32.9%),  somnolence  (31.5%),  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (20.5%), influenza (13.7%), headache (11.0%), and pyrexia (11.0%). 
CHMP comment: 
The safety profile shown during the extension phase is similar to that of the core study.  
•  Deaths 
Seven deaths during perampanel treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of perampanel were 
reported in the entire study (including the 2 events that occurred during the Core Study).

12 to <18 
CHMP comment: 
Of the 7 deaths, 6 were considered unrelated to the study drug. The other death, caused by a sudden 
unexplained  death  in  epilepsy  (SUDEP),  was  considered  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
investigator.  
There  was  one  death  in  the  12  to  <18  years  age  group.  A 
 subject  died  due  to  immune 
thrombocytopenic  purpura,  haemorrhage  intracranial  and  haemorrhage  intracranial.  All  3  events  that 
occurred in this subject were considered unrelated to the study drug by the investigator.

•  Treatment-emergent SAEs 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 113 subjects (16.6%) in the Safety Analysis Set.  
Treatment-emergent SAEs that occurred in more than 1 subject were: 
- status epilepticus (6 subjects; 0.9%),  
- pneumonia, epilepsy and seizure (5 subjects; 0.7% each),  
- cataract, contusion, skin laceration and abortion induced (4 subjects; 0.6% each),  
-  ankle  fracture,  brain  contusion,  intervertebral  disc  protrusion,  aggression  and  suicide  attempt  (3 
subjects; 0.4% each),  
-  and  pyelonephritis  acute,  road  traffic  accident,  hypernatremia,  osteoarthritis,  altered  state  of 
consciousness,  dizziness,  haemorrhage  intracranial,  partial  seizures  with  secondary  generalization, 
seizure cluster, pregnancy, postictal psychosis and psychotic disorder (2 subjects; 0.3%).  
CHMP comment: 
Most of the treatment-emergent SAEs were considered unrelated to the study drug and resolved with 
appropriate measures such as medication.  
Most of the subjects recovered without sequelae from the treatment-emergent SAEs. Except one fatal 
treatment-emergent SAE (case of SUDEP considered possibly related to the study drug seen previously 
among  the  deaths),  32  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  considered  related  (possibly  related  and 
probably related) to the study drug by the investigator in 27/113 subjects. 
•  TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study or study drug 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation (study or drug withdrawal) were reported in 141 subjects (20.8%).  
In the 12 to <18 years age group, those TEAEs were reported in 15 subjects (20.5%).  
TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  that  occurred  in  more  than  3  subjects  (0.4%)  were  dizziness  (25 
subjects; 3.7%), irritability (16 subjects; 2.4%), aggression (11 subjects; 1.6%), somnolence (10 
subjects;  1.5%),  nausea,  ataxia  and  balance  disorder  (5  subjects;  0.7%  each),  and  fatigue, 
seizure, pregnancy, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt and rash (4 subjects; 0.6% each). 
CHMP comment: 
The safety profile shown during the extension phase is overall similar to that of the core study or to the 
known  safety  profile  as  described  in  the  PI.  Indeed,  all  the  AE  described  above  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  study  or  study  drug  (in  particular  dizziness  and  irritability)  are  already  stated  in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC of perampanel. 
In the SmPC, it is stated: “The adverse reactions most commonly (≥ 1% in the total perampanel group 
and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and somnolence”. Therefore, this 
is overall in line with what was observed in controlled phase 3 studies assessing the efficacy and safety 
of perampanel when given for the treatment of POS in adjunction to other AED.  
Other Safety Findings 
There  were  no  changes  of  clinical  importance  in  mean  and  median  laboratory  values  over  time.  The 
incidence  of  markedly  abnormal  laboratory  values  was  low  and  generally  comparable  across  the  4 
treatment groups.

There  were  no  changes  of  clinical  importance  in  mean  and  median  vital  signs  and  weight  over  time. 
The incidence of clinically notable values for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse 
rate was low and comparable across the 4 treatment groups. 
Clinically  notable  elevations  in  body  weight  occurred  in  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the 
perampanel groups than in the placebo group. 
There  were  no  changes  of  clinical  importance  in  mean  and  median  ECG  parameters  over  time. 
Regarding QTc assessments, no clinically significant results were found. 
There were no reports of abuse, misuse, or overdose with perampanel.  
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour,  while  low,  was  higher  in  the 
perampanel  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  suicidal  ideation 
or behaviour based on the C-SSRS results was 7.7% in the Safety Analysis Set, although comparable 
across the 4 treatment groups. 
CHMP comment: 
Regarding  laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  blood  pressure  measurements  and  ECG  parameters,  there 
were no notable changes of clinical importance in this study and the rate of changes were comparable 
across the treatments groups and the placebo group. 
There were clinically notable elevations in body weight that occurred in a higher percentage of subjects 
in  the  perampanel  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  weight  increase  is  an  AE  already  stated  in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC as a common AE. 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour,  while  low,  was  higher  in  the 
perampanel  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group,  although  comparable  across  the  4  treatment  groups. 
The  suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal  attempt  are  AEs  already  stated  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  as 
uncommon  AEs.  The  incidence  of  the  AEs  seems  higher  that  uncommon  in  this  study,  however  it  is 
difficult to draw any conclusion on its frequency as the recording of these AEs is probably not similar 
between the blinded phase 3 studies and this extension study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Fycompa  (perampanel)  as  an 
adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and adolescents.  
Fycompa was taken as a single oral dose once daily. The drug was taken at doses of 4 mg/day to 12 
mg/day  to  be  effective  therapy  in  partial-onset  seizures.  The  drug  was  initiated  with  a  dose  of  2 
mg/day  as  per  the  approved  package  insert.  The  dose  was  increased  based  on  clinical  response  and 
tolerability by increments of 2 mg/day to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day. 
The primary endpoint for the core study was efficacy and for the extension period it was the safety on 
a long-term manner. 
Regarding the efficacy, perampanel has shown efficacy in adults and adolescents using 4mg, 8 mg or 
12  mg  of  perampanel,  with  significant  results  in  comparison  to  placebo  for  the  two  highest  dosages. 
This  non-significant  result  for  the  4  mg  dosing  however  does  not  allow  to  draw  any  firm  conclusion 
regarding  the  lack  of  efficacy  of  this  dosage  and  does  not  challenge  the  known  efficacy  results  for 
perampanel in the studied population, mainly in adults.  
For  the  paediatric  subgroup,  the  results  showed  that  the  median  treatment  differences  in  seizure 
frequency  from  placebo  are  weak  for  the  perampanel  4  and  8  mg  groups  (4.09%  and  -12.68% 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

respectively)  and  rather  high  for  the  perampanel  12  mg  group  (-51.62%).  The  MAH  provided  a 
detailed table with the median percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days in paediatrics during 
the  Core  study  and  the  extension  study  for  each  dosage  compared  to  placebo.  These  results  are 
discussed by the MAH. In the same manner, the results showed that the responder rate is weaker for 
the perampanel 4 and 8 mg groups (% and % respectively) than for placebo (%) and rather high for 
the  perampanel  12  mg  group  %).  The  MAH  provided  a  detailed  table  with  the  responder  rate  in 
paediatrics during the Core study and the extension study for each dosage compared to placebo. These 
results are discussed by the MAH. Overall, as for the median percent change in seizure frequency, the 
overall  same  trend  for  the  responder  rate  is  observed  for  the  low  and  high  perampanel  doses.  The 
main  drawback  for  interpretation  is  probably  linked  to  the  low  number  of  paediatrics  which  did  not 
allow  to  draw  any  precise  and  robust  conclusion.  Therefore,  although  no  specific  conclusion  could  be 
drawn from this additional analysis, this issue is not pursued and considered solved as it did not put in 
question the recommended daily dose of perampanel in the studied population as agreed in the PI. 
Regarding  the  safety,  the  AEs  described  in  Study  335  are  overall  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile for Fycompa described in the SmPC. The safety results of the study reported that 113 subjects 
(16.6%)  experienced  at  least  one  SAEs.  When  scrutinizing  more  in  detail  with  PT  classification,  the 
most common AE from MedDRA SOC Nervous System Disorders are those already stated in the SmPC: 
dizziness  and  somnolence.  For  the  MedDRA  SOC  Psychotic  Disorders,  the  most  common  AE  are 
irritability,  aggression  and  agitation.  Events  reported  in  patients  who  had  medical  history  of  suicidal 
behaviours were consistent with the known safety profile of perampanel or could also be related to the 
medical  history  of  the  patients.  In  some  cases,  the  dose  decrease  was  an  option  to  continue  the 
treatment. In other cases, the subjects discontinued the study or study treatment. A total of 7 deaths 
were reported in the study with only one in a paediatric subject 
 whose death is not related 
to the study drug.  
From  these  data,  no  further  safety  conclusion  could  be  drawn  regarding  the  paediatrics  for  the 
following  reasons:  they  represent  only  11%  of  the  overall  included  patients  and  the  MAH  did  not 
provide separate data for patients aged 12 to 17 years, as the data are mixed for the overall included 
patients. This issue is a flaw of this study however not pursued. 
As detailed recently in the PSUSA  for perampanel, available post marketing data since the marketing 
authorization in July 2012 did not show additional risks associated with long-term use of perampanel. 
Nevertheless,  post-marketing  studies  are  ongoing  and  long  term  safety  in  adolescents  and  adults 
should remain a missing information in the PSUR. 
Overall,  there  were  no  significant  changes  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  previously  identified 
adverse reactions. On the basis of the review of the AEs and TEAEs in this study, no additional changes 
to the safety information of the SmPC are requested by the Applicant which is acceptable.  
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
The  MAH  submitted  the  results  of  study  335  in  order  to  fulfil  the  requirement  of  reporting  paediatric 
data  as  outlined  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  regulation  (EC)  no  1901/2006,  as  amended.  The 
fulfilment of this requirement is questionable regarding the small number of paediatrics included in this 
study (i.e. 11% of the patients). 
However,  the  MAH  provided  responses  to  the  request  for  supplementary  information  as  part  of  this 
procedure (see section “Additional clarification requested”) and the issues raised are not pursued and 
considered solved.

The  MAH  determined  that  the  benefit-risk  ratio  for  Fycompa  remains  unchanged  and  positive  for  the 
three dosages of perampanel despite the non-significant efficacy result at the end of core study for the 
4 mg dosage. Indeed, the results of this study are considered as supportive of the known safety profile 
and efficacy results of perampanel in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age and do not allow to 
draw any further robust conclusion.  
The  MAH  does  not  propose  any  changes  of  the  currently  approved  SmPC  based  on  the  present  data, 
which is supported. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this 
procedure: 
1.  For the paediatric subgroup, the subanalysis concluded that the median treatment differences 
in seizure frequency from placebo are weak for the perampanel 4 and 8 mg groups (4.09% and 
-12.68% respectively) and rather high for the perampanel 12 mg group (-51.62%). The MAH is 
requested to provide a detailed table with the median percent change in seizure frequency per 
28  days  in  paediatrics  during  the  Core  study  and  the  extension  study  for  each  dosage 
compared to placebo. These results should be discussed by the MAH.  
2.  In  the  same  manner,  the  subanalysis  concluded  that  the  responder  rate  is  weaker  for  the 
perampanel  4  and  8  mg  groups  (13%  and  20%  respectively)  than  for  placebo  (25%)  and 
rather  high  for  the  perampanel  12  mg  group  78.6%).  The  MAH  is  requested  to  provide  a 
detailed table  with  the  responder  rate  in  paediatrics  during  the  Core  study  and  the  extension 
study for each dosage compared to placebo. These results should be discussed by the MAH. 
The timetable is a 30-day response timetable without clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
The MAH provides responses to the RSI. 
1.  For the paediatric subgroup, the subanalysis concluded that the median treatment differences 
in seizure frequency from placebo are weak for the perampanel 4 and 8 mg groups (4.09% and 
-12.68% respectively) and rather high for the perampanel 12 mg group (-51.62%). The MAH is 
requested to provide a detailed table with the median percent change in seizure frequency per 
28  days  in  paediatrics  during  the  Core  study  and  the  extension  study  for  each  dosage 
compared to placebo. These results should be discussed by the MAH.  
MAH’s response: 
The  percent  change  from  baseline  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days,  as  along  with  the  treatment 
differences  compared  to  placebo,  during  the  Core  study  was  provided  for  each  dose  group  by  age 
subgroup  in  the  Core  CSR  Table  14.2.1.1.1.1.6.  For  ease  of  reference,  this  table  is  presented  in  this 
response as Table 1. 
During  the  Core  study,  the  treatment  effect  based  on  the  overall  study  population  showed  a  similar 
dose-response relationship as for the pediatric subgroup, with increasing median treatment difference 
from  placebo  as  the  dose  increased  (overall  study  population:  -5.09%,  -16.45%,  and  -24.95%  and

pediatric  subgroup:  4.09%,  -12.68%,  and  -51.62%  for  the  perampanel  4,  8,  and  12  mg  groups, 
respectively). Based on rank ANCOVA, the treatment differences from placebo in the Core Study were 
statistically significant for the perampanel 8 mg group (P=0.0003) and 12 mg group (P<0.0001), but 
not for the perampanel 4 mg group (P=0.2330). Therefore, in this study, the weak efficacy  for the 4 
mg  dose  group  was  observed  not  only  in  the  paediatric  subgroup  but  also  in  the  overall  study 
population (of which majority [87.9%] were adults aged 18 to <65 years). 
Shown in Figure 1 is a forest plot depicting the median treatment differences in seizure frequency from 
placebo  for  the  overall  study  population  and  the  paediatric  subgroup  (12-<18  years)  by  each  dose. 
Note that there was a much larger variability in paediatric data and that the 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) for the paediatric data overlapped with the corresponding 95% CI for the overall study population 
for the respective dose group (Table 1). This suggests that there may not be a true difference in the 
treatment  effect  or  dose-response  relationship  of  perampanel  in  pediatric  (12  to  <18  years)  vs  adult 
(18  years  and  older)  subjects.  Rather  it  may  reflect  a  large  variability  due  to  the  small  number  of 
subjects  in  the  paediatric  subgroup  (n=12  to  25  per  treatment  group)  relative  to  the  adult/older 
subgroup (n=146 to 164 per treatment group). 
In  the  Extension  Phase,  subjects  previously  assigned  to  the  placebo  group  were  switched  to  receive 
perampanel  treatment  at  starting  dose  of  2  mg  per  day  and  up-titrated  to  reach  individual  subject’s 
optimal maintenance dose (not to exceed 12 mg per day). Subjects previously assigned to perampanel 
4,  8,  or  12  mg  groups  continued  to  receive  perampanel  treatment  in  Extension  Phase.  For  subjects 
who  achieved  4  or  8  mg/day  during  the  Core  study,  up-titration  of  perampanel  dose  was  allowed 
during Extension Phase to reach individual subject’s optimal maintenance dose (not to exceed 12 mg 
per day). 
The  median  percent  change  from  baseline  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  during  Extension  Phase 
was provided for each dose group by age subgroup in the Extension CSR Table 14.2.1.2.1.1.1.2 (pages 
700 – 701). For ease of reference, the data are presented in this response as Table 2 and Figure 2.

Overall, the patterns observed in the median percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days across 
the  treatment  groups  in  the  Core  Study  continued  into  the  Extension  Maintenance  Phase  (Figure  2). 
For example, the median percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days remained relatively low in 
the pediatric subgroup compared to adult subgroup in the Core-4 mg treatment group.

Eisai examined demographic and baseline characteristics of the pediatric subgroup vs the overall study 
population  by  treatment  groups  in  Study  335  (Table  3),  with  focus  on  clinical  factors  that  have  been 
identified  as  potential  predictive  factors  for  achieving  a  major  treatment  effect  in  patients  with 
refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures using data from three 
Phase  3,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  studies  (E2007-G000-304  [Study  304],  E2007-G000-305 
[Study 305], and E2007-G000-306 [Study 306]), as well as their open-label Extension study (E2007-
G000-307 [Study 307]) (data on file). These factors are: (a) presence of secondarily generalized tonic-
clonic  seizures  (SGTCS)  during  baseline,  higher  perampanel  plasma  concentration,  older  age  at 
diagnosis,  and  lower  baseline  seizure  frequency  in  the  double-blind  studies;  and,  (b)  lower  baseline 
seizure frequency, absence of complex partial seizures at baseline, presence of SGTCS during baseline, 
lower  number  of  baseline  AEDs,  absence  of  enzyme-inducing  antiepileptic  drugs  (EIAEDs;  defined  as 
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin) during baseline, older age at diagnosis, and absence of 
structural  etiologies  in  the  open-label  extension  study.  Examination  of  the  demography  and  baseline 
profile  data  in  Study  335  (Table  3)  shows  similar  characteristics  between  the  pediatric  subgroup  and 
the overall study population across treatment groups, except for the presence of structural etiologies in 
17.4%  vs  0%  of  pediatric  subjects  in  the  4-mg  dose  group  vs  placebo  group  that  might  partially 
explain for the “weak” effect seen in the 4-mg pediatric subgroup relative to placebo. 
To further investigate why the low dose (4-mg) group in Study 335 did not show statistically significant 
benefit  compared  to  placebo,  Eisai  examines  the  data  from  Study  a  previous  Phase  3,  multicenter, 
double--blind,  randomized,  placebo--controlled  study  (E2007-G000-306;  Study  306)  that  evaluated 
the  efficacy  of  perampanel  (2,  4,  and  8  mg/day)  given  as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in  adolescent  and 
adult  subjects  (12  to  72  years  of  age)  with  refractory  partial  seizures.  In  Study  306,  statistically 
significant  benefit  was  demonstrated  for  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  measure  percent  change  in 
seizure frequency per 28 days including the 4-mg dose group, compared to placebo. 
Table  4  shows  the  demography  and  baseline  characteristics  of  subjects  in  the  4-mg  and  8-mg  dose 
groups  with  focus  on  clinical  factors  that  may  affect  efficacy  outcome  measures  in  Study  335  and 
Study  306.  Consequently,  the  proportions  of  subjects  who  had  3  or  4  concomitant  AEDs  and  the 
proportion  of  subjects  who  were  taking  concomitant  EIAED  at  baseline  were  slightly  higher  in  Study 
335 than those in Study 306 8 mg. This suggests a more refractory patient population may have been 
entered into Study 335 and the concomitant inducer (which lowers perampanel plasma concentrations 
which  in  turn)  may  might  be  associated  with  the  lower  treatment  effects  of  perampanel  observed  in 
Study 335, relative to Study 306.

CHMP comment: 
During  the  Core  study,  the  treatment  effect  in  the  overall  study  population  showed  a  similar  dose-
response  relationship  in  the  paediatric  subgroup,  with  median  treatment  difference  from  placebo 
increasing  with  the  dose:  overall  study  population:  -5.09%,  -16.45%,  and  -24.95%  and  paediatric 
subgroup:  4.09%,  -12.68%,  and  -51.62%  for  the  perampanel  4,  8,  and  12  mg  groups,  respectively. 
These  results  were  statistically  significant  for  the  perampanel  8  mg  group  (P=0.0003)  and  12  mg 
group (P<0.0001), but not for the perampanel 4 mg group (P=0.2330). The MAH  concluded that the 
weak efficacy for the 4 mg dose group was similarly observed in the paediatric and in the overall study 
population (with nearly 90% of adults aged 18 to <65 years).  
It  should  be  highlighted  that  the  dose-response  relationship  is  more  “abrupt”  in  paediatrics  (from 
4.09% to -51.62%) than in the overall population (from -5.09% to -24.95%) where the relationship is 
more “progressive”. The MAH explains this kind of relation by a larger variability in the paediatrics data 
with  larger  confidence  intervals  in  comparison  to  the  CI  in  the  overall  population  (comprising  nearly

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

90% of adults). This aspect may be due to the small number of paediatrics per treatment groups which 
enlarges  the  CI.  This  is  acceptable  as  regards  the  low  number  of  patients  in  each  dosing  group:  23 
patients in the 4 mg group, 25 patients in the 8 mg group and 14 patients in the 12 mg group. 
The  pattern  of  change  observed  in  the  core  study  was  rather  similar  in  the  extension  phase  with  a 
median percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days in the 4 mg treatment group relatively low in 
the paediatric subgroup compared to the adult subgroup. The MAH suggested that potential predictive 
factors  like  the  kind  of  seizures  or  their  severity  could  offer  some  explanation  and  clarified  that  the 
demography  and  baseline profile  data  showed  similar  characteristics  between the  paediatrics  and the 
overall study population across treatment groups, except for the presence of structural etiologies more 
frequently  observed  in  paediatrics  receiving  4  mg  perampanel  than  in  paediatrics  receiving  placebo 
(17,4%  vs  0%).  These  aspects  could  be,  according  to  the  MAH,  a  justification  for  the  “weak”  effect 
seen  in  the  4mg  perampanel  group  in  paediatrics,  considering  that  17%  of  23  patients  (=  almost  4 
patients) are more “severe” in the 4 mg group. This interpretation is uncertain and it should rather be 
kept in mind that the 4 mg dose is mainly used as an intermediate dose in the titration scheme with a 
recommended maintenance dose of 8 mg (until 12 mg if necessary). 
Regarding Figure 2, the median percent change from baseline in seizure frequency per 28 days during 
the  different  maintenance  phases  for  the  12  mg  perampanel  group  is  systematically  higher  in  the 
paediatrics (and in the elderly i.e. > 65 years) than in the overall adult study population which could 
be  linked  to  a  higher  exposure  to  perampanel  of  paediatrics  (and  elderly)  in  comparison  to  adults, 
similarly  to  what  was  seen,  from  a  PK  point  of  view,  within  the  scope  of  variation  II/47  for  the 
paediatric data.  
Finally, for the 8 mg perampanel group, no specific comment is raised regardless of the age group.  
Overall, all these results should be considered with caution regarding the low number of paediatrics for 
each dosing group. 
To conclude, the MAH provides further analyses of paediatric data during the core study in comparison 
to  the  overall  adult  and  elderly  population,  for  each  dosage  and  discussed  them.  The  dose  response 
relationship in paediatrics is similar to that in adults, with however less precise CI around the median 
change  in  seizure  frequency  which  is  probably  related  to  the  low  number  of  paediatrics  in  each 
treatment subgroup. Although no specific conclusion could be drawn from this additional analysis, this 
issue is not pursued and considered solved as it did not put in question the recommended daily dose of 
perampanel in the studied population as agreed in the PI. 
2.  In  the  same  manner,  the  subanalysis  concluded  that  the  responder  rate  is  weaker  for  the 
perampanel  4  and  8  mg  groups  (13%  and  20%  respectively)  than  for  placebo  (25%)  and 
rather  high  for  the  perampanel  12  mg  group  78.6%).  The  MAH  is  requested  to  provide  a 
detailed table  with  the  responder  rate  in  paediatrics  during  the  Core  study  and  the  extension 
study for each dosage compared to placebo. These results should be discussed by the MAH. 
MAH’s response: 
The requested analysis was provided in the CSR for Study 335 as Table 14.2.1.2.2.1.1.2, pages 766 – 
767. For ease of reference this sub-group analysis is presented in this response as Table 5. 
As well as percent change in seizure frequency, the trend is similar in responder rate. 
This result is also considered to be related to the severity of the patients who entered in this study.

At Core study, the responder rate of 4 and 8 mg paediatric subgroups was low. During the extension 
phase,  the  responder  rate  gradually  increased  up  to  40-50%.  However,  the  responder  rate  was 
dramatically increased during the extension phase in patients who took placebo at Core study. Due to 
the small number of patients, the reason of the different response is unknown. 
CHMP comment: 
The  MAH  provides  further  data  regarding  the  responder  rate  and  discussed  them.  The  additional 
interpretation  for  the  weaker  responder  rate  for  the  perampanel  4  and  8  mg  groups  (13%  and  20% 
respectively)  than  for  placebo  (25%)  and  rather  high  for  the  perampanel  12  mg  group  78.6%  is  not 
convincing.  However,  as  for  the  median  percent  change  in  seizure  frequency,  the  overall  same  trend 
for  the  responder  rate  is  observed  for  the  low  and  high  perampanel  doses.  The  main  drawback  for 
interpretation  is  probably  linked  to  the  low  number  of  paediatrics  which  did  not  allow  to  draw  any 
precise  and  robust  conclusion.  Therefore,  although  no  specific  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  this 
additional  analysis,  this  issue  is  not  pursued  and  considered  solved  as  it  did  not  put  in  question  the 
recommended daily dose of perampanel in the studied population as agreed in the PI.

Summary of the risk management plan for eptacog 
alfa (activated) recombinant coagulation factor VII  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for NovoSeven. The RMP 
details important risks of NovoSeven, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more information will be obtained about NovoSeven’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
NovoSeven’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how NovoSeven 
should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for NovoSeven should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
NovoSeven’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for  
NovoSeven is authorised for the treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention 
of bleeding in those undergoing surgery or invasive procedures. In addition, 
NovoSeven is authorised for the treatment of severe postpartum haemorrhage when 
uterotonics are insufficient to achieve haemostasis (see SmPC for the full indication). 
It contains activated recombinant coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) as the active 
substance and it is given intravenously.  
Further information about the evaluation of NovoSeven’s benefits can be found in 
NovoSeven’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: EPAR link.  
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of NovoSeven, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about NovoSeven’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals.  
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
 
  The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of NovoSeven is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of NovoSeven are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
NovoSeven. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information 
on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine). 
Following reclassification of safety concerns, there are no important risks or missing 
information relevant for inclusion in the RMP for NovoSeven (see below).

obligation of NovoSeven.

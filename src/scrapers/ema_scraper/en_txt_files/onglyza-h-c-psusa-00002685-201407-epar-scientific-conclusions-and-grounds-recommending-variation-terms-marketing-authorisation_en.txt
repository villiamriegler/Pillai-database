Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for saxagliptin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Gastrointestinal effects are known for saxagliptin and constipation is a known adverse reaction for 
other GLP-1 based therapies (sitagliptin, liraglutide). For saxagliptin currently 18 cases of 
constipation have been reported with a positive de-challenge, including two positive re-challenges 
which indicate a causal relationship between saxagliptin and constipation. Furthermore, 3 of these 18 
cases (1 with positive rechallenge) had a short time to onset (a few days) and no concomitant 
medication or relevant co-morbidities that could have confounded the development of the 
constipation. Based on the review of cases of constipation, the PRAC considers constipation an 
adverse drug reaction with possible causal association with saxagliptin. The product information 
should therefore be updated to include “constipation” with a frequency “not known” in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC, and the PL should be updated accordingly.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding constipation, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for saxagliptin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing saxagliptin is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

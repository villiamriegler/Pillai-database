2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant seeks approval in the following indication: Durvalumab is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not 
progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Primary lung cancer is the most common form of cancer worldwide (13% of all new cancers) and the fourth 
most common form of cancer in the European Union (Ferlay et al 2015)1. Lung cancer remains the leading 
cause of cancer-related death globally (19.4% of all cancer deaths), with only 17.7% of patients surviving for 
5 years, irrespective of stage (Novello et al 2016, SEER 2016)2. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are 
NSCLC, of which the major histological types are adenocarcinoma (representing 35% to 40% of all lung 
cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (25% to 30%), and large cell carcinoma (10% to 15%) (GLOBOCAN 
2012)3. Stage III NSCLC consists of a heterogeneous population with two subsets: Stage IIIA and IIIB. 
Approximately one-third of the patients with Stage IIIA disease are considered operable. The majority of

patients with Stage IIIA/B have inoperable (unresectable) disease, but are amenable to receiving curative 
intention chemoradiation treatment.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The biological characteristics of locally advanced Stage III disease are poorly defined, although the clinical 
characteristics known to be associated with prognosis are nodes or nodes station involved, size of primary 
tumour, baseline pulmonary function, gender, presence or absence of significant weight loss, and 
performance status. 
Historically, NSCLC has been considered a non-immunogenic disease (Brahmer 2013)4. However, emerging 
evidence has demonstrated that the lack of an effective immune response is, in fact, often the result of 
specific, active immune-evasive mechanisms. These mechanisms, if understood, can be overcome 
therapeutically with meaningful clinical efficacy (Carbone et al 2016)5. The most significant advances in 
NSCLC immunotherapy have been made in metastatic setting by targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune 
checkpoint (Shu and Rizvi 2016)6. The PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors shift the balance of immune activity 
from a tumour-induced immune suppressive state toward an active antitumor immune response. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Approximately 70% of subjects with NSCLC have advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection at the 
time of diagnosis. The 5-year relative survival rates for lung cancer overall and metastatic lung cancer have 
been reported to be 17.7% and 4.3%, respectively (SEER stat facts. 2016). Poor prognostic factors for 
survival in patients with NSCLC include advanced stage of disease at the time of initial diagnosis, poor 
performance status (PS), and a history of unintentional weight loss. More than half of the patients with 
NSCLC are diagnosed with distant metastatic disease, which directly contributes to poor survival prospects. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current standard-of-care for patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC is concurrent 
chemoradiation with a platinum-based doublet and 60 Gy of radiation daily over 6 weeks administered with a 
curative intent (NCCN® Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology 2017;7 Eberhardt et al (ESMO) 2015;8 Saijo 
et al 2010)9. While chemoradiation can achieve initial disease control, the majority of patients eventually 
progress. More than 50% of patients develop distant metastasis (Bezjak et al 2015)10, and up to 40% can 
experience local recurrence (Bradley et al (RTOG 0617) 2015)11. The standard-of-care for patients with 
locally advanced, unresectable, NSCLC has remained unchanged for the past 2 decades. Several randomized 
studies have confirmed that additional induction chemotherapy (prior to chemoradiation) or consolidation

chemotherapy (after chemoradiation) in this setting does not improve clinical outcomes. The prognosis 
remains poor, and the 5-year survival rate is approximately 15% (Aupérin et al 2010)12. Therefore, new 
therapies are needed to prevent disease progression after delivery of definitive chemoradiotherapy. 
Patients whose disease does not progress after chemoradiation are carefully monitored and followed up 
without treatment. The uncertainty of knowing whether chemoradiation will provide long term benefit causes 
great psychological stress and anxiety, which is associated with lung cancer mortality (Vodermaier et al 
2017)13. While advances have been made in improving survival by optimizing locoregional control, a 
significant majority of these patients eventually progress. Most patients experience local and/or distant 
metastasis and thereby present a clinical challenge for improving outcomes. Brain metastasis disease is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Approximately one third of 
NSCLC patients develop brain metastasis, including nearly two-thirds of patients who have a systemic 
relapse. Moreover, the brain as the sole site of release occurred in approximately 20% of patients (Govindan 
et al 2008)14. For patients with distant metastatic disease who have relapsed, treatment is similar to 
management of Stage IV disease; first-line platinum-based chemotherapy is provided if the patient has been 
disease-free for more than a year, and second-line single agent chemotherapy or immunotherapy is provided 
if the patient has been disease free for less than a year  15. 
Despite continuing improvement in therapy of advanced disease, little progress has been made in locally 
advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Many randomized Phase III trials investigating the clinical benefit of 
maintenance therapy post chemoradiation failed to demonstrate OS benefits. Therefore, a significant unmet 
medical need exists for the development of new treatment strategies that can prolong these patients’ 
favourable clinical state after achieving initial disease control with chemoradiation. 
About the product 
Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that helps 
tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 can be induced by inflammatory 
signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells 
in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and 
CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation and cytokine 
production. 
Durvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks 
the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Durvalumab does not induce antibody dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Selective blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions enhances 
antitumour immune responses.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Imfinzi is presented as a sterile concentrate for solution for infusion containing 50 mg/ml of active substance 
durvalumab formulated with histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, trehalose dehydrate, polysorbate 
80 and water for injections. 
The product is available in a single-use Type I glass vial containing 2.4 mL or 10 mL of concentrate, 
corresponding to 120 mg or 500 mg durvalumab, respectively. It is diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% 
glucose prior to administration. 
The pack size of Imfinzi is 1 vial. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and CD-80, 
resulting in enhanced anti-tumor activity by eliminating the immunosuppressive effects of PD-L1 on cytotoxic 
T-cells. The heavy chain CH2 domain of durvalumab was engineered to contain three amino acid substitutions 
that are referred to as triple mutation (TM); a leucine to a phenylalanine at residue 238, a leucine to a 
glutamatic acid at residue 239, and a proline to a serine at residue 335. These TM amino acid substitutions 
were introduced to reduce Fc-mediated effector functions of the antibody molecule such as antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement fixation. 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody of approximately 149 kDa, including oligosaccharides. 
The antibody is composed of two identical heavy chains of approximately 49 kDa each (theoretical mass 
without glycosylation), and two identical light chains of approximately 24 kDa each. Durvalumab has 
primarily N-linked biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides attached to each heavy chain at Asn-301. The 
average size of the oligosaccharide moiety is approximately 1500 Da per heavy chain. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Durvalumab active substance is manufactured at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LC (formerly MedImmune 
LLC) Frederick, Maryland, USA. This is also the site for storage and testing of active substance, except for 
mycoplasma testing which occurs at Charles River Laboratories, Malvem, Pennsylvania, USA.  
Both sites are covered by valid EU GMP certificates. No issues have been identified during the review of the 
dossier calling for an inspection. 
The durvalumab active substance production process includes cell culture process in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells, harvest and a series of purification steps.  
The cell culture and harvest process consists of five steps: working cell bank (WCB) vial thaw; inoculum 
expansion in shake flasks of increasing size and rocker bags; seed bioreactors; durvalumab production in 
bioreactor, and cell removal and clarification during harvest. The production bioreactor is operated in a fed-
batch mode. When the bioreactor reaches the target product concentration, the target culture duration, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 15/143 
 
the lower limit for cell viability, the harvest is initiated. Overall, the upstream (cell culture and harvest) 
process and the process controls has been described in sufficient detail. A few minor concerns were raised 
during the procedure regarding the criterion for initiation of harvest. These issues were adequately addressed 
in the responses provided. 
The purification process consists of three chromatography steps: a product capture step and to remove 
process-related impurities; anion exchange chromatography is designed to bind and remove process-related 
impurities and putative viruses; cation exchange chromatography is carried out in bind and elute mode to 
remove product- and process-related impurities. Two virus clearance steps are conducted: a low pH 
treatment step and a virus filtration step. Finally, a concentration and diafiltration step is conducted to 
achieve a specific target protein concentration. The formulated bulk is prepared by dilution and excipient 
addition to achieve a specific target protein concentration and formulation composition. The formulated bulk 
is 0.2 micron filtered and filled directly into a storage container, after which it is designated active substance. 
The active substance is stored at 2-8℃ prior to shipment at 2-15℃ to a finished product manufacturing site 
for fill and finish.  
Two purification process steps are qualified as reprocessing steps for the manufacture of the active 
substance. Overall, the description of the harvest and isolation process and the product purification is 
sufficient.  During the procedure, the applicant was asked to provide additional details on the column steps 
(dimensions and volumes, process times, and conditions for discard/collection of eluate). Furthermore, the 
applicant was asked to specify post-use integrity test of bioburden filters. Finally, the applicant was asked to 
indicate the sterile filtration steps in the process flow diagrams. All issues were sufficiently addressed in the 
responses provided. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials 
Raw materials used in the manufacture of durvalumab active substance have been listed appropriately, 
identifying where each raw material is used in the process. For non-compendial materials internal quality 
standards exists. Raw materials are tested and released according to approved specifications and require a 
minimum of appearance and identification testing. 
A risk assessment on the use of FBS in the culture and banking of the host cell line has been performed and 
concludes that the risk posed for potential Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) infectious agent 
introduction is low. The raw materials therefore do not pose a Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy 
(TSE) risk or viral risk. No formal TSE risk or virus risk assessment in accordance with Ph. Eur was initially 
presented so the information was requested during the procedure. Although not presented in the format 
requested (risk-assessment for each individual raw material), the response provided is considered to cover 
the information requested and the issue is resolved. 
Source, history and generation of the cell substrate 
The Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line, is used as the host cell line, . The source history and generation of cell 
substrate is considered adequately described and in accordance with current guidelines. A minor concern on 
the potential use of porcine trypsin in the early stages of development of the host cell line was raised during 
the procedure. With the response provided, the requested information regarding the potential use of porcine 
trypsin in the early stages of the host cell development has been provided. 
The cell banking system employed for durvalumab is a standard two-tiered system including a MCB from 
which multiple WCBs are derived. Active substance lots are generated from the WCB. Testing of MCB and 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 16/143 
 
WCBs was performed according to relevant guidelines (ICH Q5A and ICH Q5D). All results complied with the 
acceptance criteria, demonstrating that the cell banks are microbiologically and virologically safe for clinical 
and commercial applications.  The potential relevance of including specific tests for porcine viruses (from 
trypsin) was raised during the procedure. In the response the applicant confirmed that the Master Cell Stock 
has been tested for porcine viruses. 
The cell line stability was tested according to ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D.  
Criteria are listed for the qualification of new WCBs. 
In general, the cell banking system, including establishment of the MCB, WCB and generation of EOP cells, 
the characterisation and testing are considered adequately described and in accordance with current 
guidelines.   
Process validation 
The proposed manufacturing control strategy for the durvalumab active substance is considered appropriate 
to ensure process consistency and product meeting the required quality attributes. A risk-based approach in 
line with ICH Q8 has been used for the identification of CQAs and CPPs.  
Process characterisation studies for the production of active substance have been carried out. These studies 
determined the impact of the process parameters on product quality, resulting in their classification as Critical 
Process Parameters (CPPs) or non-Critical Process Parameters (NCPPs). Impacts of process parameters on 
process performance were also determined. The process characterisation studies were performed using scale-
down models that were verified to adequately predict the performance of the commercial scale process. 
The approach for manufacturing process characterisation is described in sufficient detail and is found 
acceptable. No design space is claimed and no significant or unusual flexibility in the manufacturing process 
has been requested.  
The control strategy for durvalumab is based on a systematic risk assessment which was presented. The 
control strategy has been sufficiently described and found acceptable.  
The commercial manufacture of durvalumab active substance at the AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, 
Frederick Manufacturing Center (FMC) has been validated. The process validation included CPPs, some 
NCPPs, In-Process Controls (IPCs), Microbial Controls (MCs), and Performance Attributes (PAs). 
Validation was performed on five consecutive process validation lots. Except for one out-of-specification 
result (OOS), all process validation study results met the pre-approved validation criteria. OOS root cause 
was investigated and corrective actions were taken as a result of the investigation. There was no impact to 
product quality. 
Overall, the process validation confirmed that the active substance manufacturing process is robust, 
adequately controlled, and consistently able to produce quality product. Minor concerns were raised during 
the procedure. These issues have been clarified.  
Manufacturing process development 
Two manufacturing processes have been used during the development of durvalumab.  
Evaluation of the comparability of the durvalumab active substance between manufacturing changes during 
manufacturing process development, including routine and extended characterization, supports that the 
process changes implemented from clinical batches to conformance batches did not impact product 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 17/143 
 
characteristics or the process consistency. Process robustness studies conducted during process development 
and characterisation generally confirmed that the described manufacturing process is suitable for the 
production of durvalumab active substance meeting the required quality attributes. 
Characterisation 
Durvalumab is characterised with the standard analytical methods for a monoclonal antibody. The classical 
IgG1 structure is confirmed with identification of the higher order structure, glycosylation profile, charge and 
size heterogeneity and biological activity.   
Durvalumab is classified as a Class II antibody (binding to cell bound antigen with blocking function) and with 
minimised effector function potential due to the engineered Fc mutations. The overall characterisation of 
durvalumab has been performed with a sufficient level of detail.  
The characterisation of the product-related impurities has been described in sufficient detail. Request for 
further information was raised for process-related impurities, with a request to describe in more detail. This 
information has been provided by the applicant on the methods used for detection of product related 
impurities. 
Specification 
The active substance specification is provided and includes control of identity, purity and impurities, 
bioactivity and other general tests. 
The analytical procedures have been described in sufficient detail and adequate system suitability tests with 
suitable acceptance criteria have been composed for the methods. The applicant was requested to include 
representative chromatograms, electropherograms and electrophoresis profiles where relevant. This has been 
done. For the AP-1 reporter gene bioassay, the statistical approach for analysis of data and setting of 
suitability test was requested to be clarified. This has been sufficiently addressed in the response provided.  
The extent of the validation of the analytical procedures is found sufficient.  
The active substance and finished product specifications are part of the control strategy composed based on 
the product quality attribute risk assessment. The attributes included in the release and shelf-life 
specifications have been found adequate. The justification of the limits for the attributes in the active 
substance specification is found satisfactory and the limits are acceptable. The justification of the limits are 
based on compendial limits/guidance and literature, clinical experience, nonclinical toxicology experience, and 
characterisation of the structure-function relationship for the relevant quality attributes. In addition, the 
stability data and manufacturing process capability have been considered.  
Batch analysis 
The batch data presented demonstrate manufacturing consistency. All lots produced met the specifications in 
place at the time of release. 
Reference materials 
The applicant has established a two-tiered (primary and working) reference standard system as 
recommended in ICH Q6B. The reference standards are prepared in-house. 
In the dossier, the preparation, qualification and stability of the current primary reference standard have 
been described. This includes the description of the preparation, qualification and summary of the stability 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 18/143 
 
data. In addition, a description of the historical reference standard used during the pre-clinical and toxicology 
studies has been included.  
The future establishment of primary and working reference standards has been described, including 
preparation, routine characterisation/qualification and stability programme. Overall, the description is found 
adequate. However, the applicant was requested during the procedure to perform further characterisation of 
future reference standard unless otherwise justified. The applicant has confirmed that future reference 
standards will be characterised with the same panel of tests that will adequately describe both primary and 
working standard. In addition, the statistics behind the assignment of potency to future reference standard 
was requested to be discussed and justified. With the response provided, the applicant has sufficiently 
explained the statistic behind assignment of potency and acceptance criteria for future reference standards.  
Stability 
The primary packaging component for the durvalumab active substance is a disposable, single-use bag 
intended for long-term storage of the active substance at 2-8° C. The commercial container provides 
protection from microbial contamination and environmental effects. The materials used for the container are 
in compliance with compendial requirements for plastic containers, as specified in relevant Ph. Eur. 
monographs. 
Leachables and extractables from the container were assessed by performing a simulation study at the 
intended long-term storage temperature (2-8°C), and under accelerated (23-27°C/55-65 % residual 
humidity (RH)) and stressed (38-42°C/70-80 % RH) storage conditions for six months. The results presented 
support the safety of long-term, 2-8°C active substance storagefor at least 24 months.  
Real-time, real-temperature long-term stability studies of durvalumab active substance were performed at 2-
8°C for 24 months using three primary lots and supporting lots according to the definitions in ICH Q1A (R2).  
Comparability has been demonstrated between Clinical and Commercial lots.  
Three different container closure systems are represented in the stability studies. Material from all processes 
demonstrated similar stability in the commercial container closure. 
The proposed active substance shelf life is 24 months at the long-term storage condition of 2-8°C in 
commercial container. Twenty-four months of real-time, real-temperature data are presented for the primary 
stability studies as well as 24 months of data for supporting stability studies. Stability test results meet the 
commercial acceptance criteria at the long-term storage condition for all primary and supporting stability lots. 
In addition to this, each year of manufacturing, one representative batch of active substance will be placed 
into the ongoing stability program. A minor concern regarding the lack of references to the methods used in 
the stability study was raised. This has been clarified. 
Stability data have been provided, supporting an active substance shelf-life of 24 months when stored at 2-
8°C in commercial container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Composition 
The durvalumab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, liquid dosage form intended for intravenous 
infusion after dilution. It is supplied as a single-dose vial in two presentations: 500 mg of durvalumab per vial 
with a 10.0 mL nominal volume (10.77 mL target fill volume) and 120 mg of durvalumab per vial with a 2.4 
mL nominal volume (2.77 mL target fill volume). Minimum fill volumes are described. The finished product 
contains 50 mg/mL durvalumab in 26 mM histidine/histidine-HCl, 275 mM trehalose dihydrate, 0.02% (w/v) 
polysorbate 80 and water for injections, pH 6.0.  
Both presentations of the finished product are aseptically filled into 10R glass vials and closed with a latex-
free elastomeric stopper. The finished product vial is then capped with an aluminium seal. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The formulation development has been thoroughly described and the rationale for the selection of the 
formulation has been adequately addressed and justified. The same formulation composition was used 
throughout the clinical and commercial development of the product. The dosage form has changed from a 
lyophilised form to a liquid form through clinical development. A fill overage is added to the two vial 
presentations and justified.  
The manufacturing process development has been described in detail. CQAs and commercial control strategy 
have been described. The durvalumab finished product is presented in single-use vials without preservative. 
The measures to control microbiological quality and sterility of the finished product are considered 
acceptable. The container closure system and the assessment of the suitability of the components have been 
described. Results of extractable and leachable studies revealed no unexpected components.  
The results of the finished product comparability studies have been presented in the dossier. All results met 
the comparability acceptance criteria. The results demonstrate that batches are comparable. Both routine and 
characterisation test results showed that the quality of the material intended for commercial use is similar to 
material used in clinical studies. Degradation rates and/or profiles from accelerated and stressed stability of 
durvalumab finished product batches were comparable over 3 months of stability. 
A compatibility study with the infusion system demonstrated that the finished product diluted into 0.9% 
(w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) glucose was compatible with the infusion system and the diluents. Comparability 
has been adequately described. 
Overall, the pharmaceutical development of durvalumab finished product has been described in sufficient 
detail. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The active substance is pre-filtered into a mixing vessel and pooled. During filling, pooled active substance is 
continuously 0.2 µm sterile filtered as it is aseptically filled into sterile vials, closed with sterile stoppers and 
sealed. The resulting finished product is 100% visually inspected, labelled and packaged, and stored at 2-
8°C. The description of manufacture of durvalumab finished product is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 20/143 
 
The proposed manufacturing control strategy for the durvalumab finished product manufacturing process and 
the performed process validation are considered appropriate to ensure process consistency and product 
meeting the required quality attributes. 
On request, missing information on validation of the secondary manufacturing (labeling and packaging) at 
the AstraZeneca site was provided. 
Container Closure System 
The primary packaging for finished product is a colourless Ph. Eur. Type I glass vial sealed with a 20 mm 
Teflon-coated rubber stopper and crimped with a 20 mm aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. All 
product-contacting materials comply with relevant pharmacopeia requirements. 
The container-closure system used for durvalumab finished product is adequately described. Compatibility of 
the container-closure system with durvalumab is demonstrated with the stability information. Extractables 
from the container and closure are evaluated to be non-toxic. The container closure integrity is 
demonstrated. 
The sterilisation methods and conditions for the primary packaging materials are described. 
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes control of identity, purity and impurities, bioactivity and other 
general tests. 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications are considered adequate to ensure the quality of the 
finished product. It was requested that the finished product release and shelf-life specifications should include 
reference to relevant monographs or internal methods. Tables have been provided with the method 
references.  
Validation studies are presented for the methods that are only applicable for the finished product. The 
validations presented and the transfer qualification information presented are considered acceptable. A short 
summary of the robustness study for the container closure integrity including the parameters investigated 
and the conclusion was requested and has been provided.  
An evaluation of elemental impurities, as required according to the ICH Q3D Guideline, has been submitted.  
The justification for the limits for the finished product specific specification parameters are in line with the 
specification for active substance and are found acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
The lot release test results were presented. All lots produced met the specifications in place at the time of 
release. The batch data presented demonstrate manufacturing consistency. 
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for finished product is the same as that used for active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The intended shelf life for durvalumab finished product is 36 months, when stored at 2-8°C. Real-time long 
term stability studies are designed according to ICH guidance, including a minimum of three primary lots of 
each presentation (120 mg and 500 mg) of durvalumab finished product as well as supporting lots. All 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 21/143 
 
primary and supporting studies were performed using durvalumab finished product material in the final 
formulation, and the same container closure system (10R glass vials with Teflon-coated rubber stoppers), 
which is also intended for storage and distribution. 
The stability studies performed, the protocols used, and the results of the studies are presented. In short, 
real-time, long term studies were performed at 2-8°C. The results obtained to date comply with the 
acceptance criteria. A discrepancy regarding the time-points for which long-term stability data was provided, 
was detected between the information given in the finished product Quality Overall Summary and Module 3, 
which has to be addressed by the applicant. This has been done. 
Stability studies at accelerated (23-27°C/55-65% RH, 6 months) and stressed (38-42°C/70-80% RH, 3 
months) storage conditions have been performed. These studies are completed. 
Based on the stability data presented the claimed shelf life of 3 years (2°C – 8°C) for the finished product 
can be accepted. Regarding the diluted solution, if not used immediately, chemical and physical in-use 
stability of Imfinzi has been demonstrated for no more than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C or 4 hours at room 
temperature up to 25°C from the time of vial puncture to the start of administration. 
Photostability 
A photostability study was performed according to ICH Q1B using one commercial scale batch of each 
presentation (). It was demonstrated that the marketing pack satisfactorily protects the finished product 
material from the effects of light exposure, as all results obtained complied with the acceptance criteria.  
Water loss 
A study was conducted for determination of water loss during storage at recommended long-term conditions 
and accelerated conditions, for which 24 months of results have been obtained. To date, no water loss has 
been detected from the primary packaging.  
Elemental purities 
Finally, elemental purities studies were performed, using three commercial scale lots representing both 
presentations. Results obtained through the 24 month time point are below the dose-adjusted Permissible 
Daily Exposure level established according to ICH Q3D. 
Adventitious agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents 
As required, a risk assessment of the transmission of BSE from FBS used in the culture and banking of the 
host cell line has been performed and concludes that the risk posed for potential BSE infectious agent 
introduction is low. However, a TSE risk assessment on the remaining biologically derived raw materials could 
not be located in the dossier. These documents were requested and have been provided. 
Viral adventitious agents 
Assurance of viral safety of durvalumab active substance and finished product is based on the following 
approaches as defined by ICH Q5A: control of raw materials used in manufacturing, virus testing and 
characterisation of the cell banks used in GMP manufacturing, virus testing of unprocessed bulk, and 
inactivation assessment of the purification process. 
For the FBS used, this risk is considered very low as no viruses were detected in any of the virus assays 
including the in vitro assay for bovine adventitious viral agents (Modified 9 CFR) applied for testing of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 22/143 
 
MCB. For the cholesterol used, the preparation process is evaluated to minimise the risk of transmitting 
infectious viruses.  
Testing of both MCB and WCB cell banks was performed according to current guidelines (ICH Q5A and ICH 
Q5D), including testing for cell identity, mycoplasma, sterility (bacteria, fungi), endogenous and adventitious 
viruses. The cell banks have been extensively tested for presence of endogenous and adventitious viruses 
according to ICH Q5A, using both unspecific and specific in vitro and in vivo assays. All results complied with 
the acceptance criteria, demonstrating that the WCB is microbiologically and virologically safe for clinical and 
commercial applications. A question was posed to the potential relevance of including specific testing for 
porcine viruses. The applicant confirmed specific testing for porcine viruses. 
Aseptic processing of the inoculum train and closed system processing of the rest of the steps adds to 
minimising the risk of potential virus contamination or process carry-over during manufacturing.  
The measures applied in order to minimise the risk of introducing adventitious viruses and for contamination 
by process carry-over are considered acceptable. 
The capability of the durvalumab downstream purification process for viral clearance has been validated using 
four model viruses with different physicochemical properties. Five steps, including four orthogonal steps, of 
the purification process were evaluated, including the Capture chromatography, the low pH treatment, the 
anion and cation exchange chromatography, and the virus filtration (20 nm) step.  
The virus clearance studies have demonstrated significant clearance of all four model viruses by the 
manufacturing process. A safety margin for clearance of endogenous RVLPs of > 8.3 log10 corresponding to 
less than 1 retrovirus particle for every 2.0 x 108 doses was obtained, which is considered acceptable. The 
design of and the safety margin obtained from the performed virus clearance studies are in accordance with 
ICH Q5A. 
In addition to the viral clearance capability demonstrated for the manufacturing process, the extensive 
testing of cell substrates and unprocessed bulk, the control of raw materials and manufacturing process, and 
the environmental monitoring and pest control programs enable the durvalumab active substance and 
finished product to be considered as virologically safe.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No Major Objection was identified during the procedure. 
Overall, the quality of Imfinzi is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines. The cell culture and purification of the active substance are adequately described, 
controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its physicochemical and 
biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The 
manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of 
the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
The overall quality of Imfinzi is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in 
the SmPC.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets human (h)PD-L1. It contains 3 
point mutations in its constant domain that reduce binding of C1q as well as the affinity of the Fc domain for 
the antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity-inducing Fcγ receptors (Oganesyan et al, 2008). The 
binding of durvalumab to PD-L1 inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 receptors expressed 
on immune cells. This activity overcomes PD-L1-mediated inhibition of antitumour immunity. 
PD-L1 is a member of the B7 family of ligands that normally regulate the activation of T cells through binding 
to the PD-1 receptor (Keir et al, 2008). PD-L1 is aberrantly expressed in malignancies of several origins at a 
high frequency (Dong et al, 2002). PD-L1 represses antitumour T-cell responses in tumours and secondary 
lymphoid organs and protects tumours from immune elimination (Zou and Chen, 2008). Expression of PD-L1 
in tumours is associated with reduced survival and unfavorable prognosis (Mu et al, 2011; Thompson et al, 
2005; Thompson et al, 2006; Krambeck et al, 2007; Nomi et al, 2007; Loos et al, 2008; Wang et al, 2010; 
Hamanishi et al, 2007). Inhibition of the PD-L1 /PD-1 axis has demonstrated antitumour activity in several 
preclinical studies (Hirano et al, 2005; Iwai et al, 2002; Okudaira et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2008). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro: 
Analysis of sequence homology of human, mouse, rat and cynomolgus monkey PD-L1 (ONC4736-0012) and 
confirmation that binding of durvalumab to recombinant human PD-L1 depends on arginine at position 95 in 
PD-L1 (ONC4736-0014).  
Extracellular domain sequences of hPD-L1 were compared to its homologous for other species (cynoPD-L1, 
rPD-L1 and mPD-L1). After comparison, the identity of the protein sequence was established as follows: hPD-
L1 vs. cynoPD-L1 (95.9%); hPD-L1 vs. mPD-L1 (73.5%) and hPD-L1 vs. rPD-L1 (74.4%). 
In addition, arginine at position 95 in B7-H1 (PD-L1), which is critical for the binding of MEDI4736 to 
recombinant human B7-H1 (PD-L1), is conserved only in human and cynomolgus monkey B7-H1 (PD-L1). 
Thus, the likelihood of binding of MEDI4736 to cynomolgus monkey B7-H1 (PD-L1) is high. In contrast, the 
binding of MEDI4736 to mouse and rat B7-H1 is unlikely. 
Durvalumab affinity and specificity [ONC4736-0001 and -0007]: Durvalumab Binds to Human and 
Cynomolgus Monkey PD-L1 with High Affinity (ONC4736-0001) and does not Bind to Human Proteins of 
Related Sequence or Function or Mouse PD-L1 (ONC4736-0007). The affinity (represented by the equilibrium 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 24/143 
 
dissociation constant [KD]) of durvalumab for rhPD-L1 and rcynoPD-L1 in solution was measured using 
KinExA label-free technology). The KD values for binding of durvalumab to rhPD-L1 and rcynoPD-L1 were 22 
and 78 pM, respectively. Based on these results, durvalumab has a high affinity and specificity for both rhPD-
L1 and rcynoPD-L1. 
Durvalumab inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 or CD80 (ONC4736-0002) and overcomes the PD-L1-
mediated inhibition of primary human T Cells in vitro (ONC4736-0003): The half-maximal inhibitor 
concentration (IC50) values were 0.10 (PD-L1) and 0.04 (CD80) nM, respectively.  
When anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and CAT004 (mouse IgG1) were incorporated to the cultures of primary human T 
cells, an increase of proliferation and IFN- was observed. In this study, the effect of rhPD-L1 was confirmed 
by reducing both T-cell proliferation and IFN- releasing. This reducing effect was reverted with durvalumab, 
which was not observed in the case of incubation with CAT254 (isotype control). 
The in vitro potency of durvalumab varies when using primary T Cells from different donors (ONC4736-
0020): A CHO cell line expressing a membrane bound form of the anti-CD3 antibody and hPD-L1 was treated 
with Mitomycin-C and cultured with primary human CD3+ T cells. Durvalumab increased the proliferation of T 
cells, while the incorporation of the isotype matched control antibody (NIP228) did not affect T cells 
proliferation. The EC90 value could be estimated at 0.99 g/mL. The cumulative frequency distribution 
indicated that concentrations above 3 g/mL achieved 90% of maximal response. 
Durvalumab does not inhibit the activity of antigen-presenting cells or trigger effector function (ONC4736-
0005, ONC4736-0015): No effect of durvalumab was observed in an in vitro antigen-recall assay. These 
results showed that durvalumab did not affect the activity of antigen-presenting cells. 
Assessment of durvalumab-induced release of cytokines (IFN-, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-) in human whole blood 
(ONC4736-0004). Cultures of plasma-depleted human whole blood were incubated during 24 hours in the 
presence of durvalumab or anti-human CD3, as a control positive. No cytokines were released in the 
presence of durvalumab. 
Assessment of release of cytokines induced by durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab (a fully 
humanized anti-CTLA-4 antibody, which blocks CD80 and CD86) (ONC4736-0017): The combination of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab did not increase the levels of cytokines in supernatants. 
Cellular PD-L1 (ONC4736-0013) and soluble PD-L1 (ONC4736-0008) are present in a range of human 
cancers:  The PD-L1 expression was investigated by using the chimeric 2.14H9 mIgG1 antibody. The higher 
number of positive samples to 2.14H9 mIgG1 were obtained in gastric (6/6), colorectal (7/8), renal (9/10) 
and lung (7/9). In this study, some nontumour cells, including infiltrating mononuclear and stroma cells, 
showed a positive membranous and cytoplasmic staining for PD-L1. An additional study showed that levels of 
soluble PD-L1 in plasma of patients with cancer (NSCLC-ADC, NSCLC-SCC and CRC) were higher than in 
healthy subjects.  
10F.9G2 (surrogate antimouse PD-L1 antibody) binds mouse PD-L1 with high affinity and inhibits the binding 
of mouse PD-L1 to PD-1 and CD80 (ONC4736-0009, ONC4736-0010): The aim of this study was to validate 
this antibody to test in an in vivo mouse models of human cancer. The KD value for binding of 10F.9G2 to 
rmuB7-H1 was 7.66 pM. 
In vivo 
Durvalumab was evaluated in vivo murine models of human cancer.

EMA/548232/2018 
Page 25/143 
 
Durvalumab inhibits the growth of human tumours in mice via an immune-mediated killing mechanism 
(ONC4736-0006): The Applicant used A375 (human melanoma) and HPAC (human pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma) cells enriched for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Treatment with durvalumab reduced the tumour 
volume in the HPAC xenograft model, resulting in a maximum tumour growth inhibition of 74%. In the case 
of A375 xenograft model, durvalumab inhibited tumour growth in the presence of T cells.  
The antitumor activity of anti-mouse PD-L1 is dose dependent in the CT26 mouse colorectal cancer model 
(ONC4736- 0019): Animals administered with 10F.9G2  (a surrogate antimouse PD-L1 antibody) improved 
median survival time compared to control group, although only 1, 10 and 20 mg/Kg dose levels showed 
significant differences (1 mg/Kg (p=0.006), 10 mg/Kg (p=0.0003), and 20 mg/Kg (p=0.006) of 10F.9G2). 
The dose of 5 mg/Kg did not significantly increase the median survival rate (p=0.111). The highest survival 
rate was recorded in the group treated at 10 mg/Kg (87.5%), followed by 1 and 20 mg/Kg (62.5%); and 
finally 5 mg/Kg of 10F.9G2 (37.5%).  
Combination of anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody with oxaliplatin (ONC4736-0011) or with anti-mouse CTLA-4 
antibody (ONC4736-0018). All treatments given alone increased the median survival time. The combination 
(PD-L1 antibody with oxaliplatin or PD-L1 antibody with CTLA-4) prolonged the values obtained with the 
individual components. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies with durvalumab were conducted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology parameters were evaluated following administration of durvalumab in the GLP 4- and 
13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys (Study VMM0008 and Study VMM0033).  
These included neurological parameters (assessed by clinical observations), cardiovascular parameters 
(electrocardiogram [ECG; including heart rate, wave form morphology, ST segment and PR and QT interval, 
corrected QT interval (QTcM or QTcB)] and blood pressure parameters, and respiration rate.  
Cardiovascular measurements were conducted pre-dose, days 8 and 29, 1h post dose. Tmax was 1.5 or 6.5 
hours in VMM0008 on day 1. The lowest dose of 30 mg/kg provided similar Cmax (mean 625 and 634 µg/ml, 
male and female monkey, respectively) to Cmax in clinic (mean 364, range 200-1221 µg/ml). The highest 
dose administered provided a Cmax of 3780 and 3810 µg/ml, in male and female monkey, respectively, 
providing a safety margin of approximately 10 compared to the clinically relevant plasma concentrations. 
Neurobehavioural screening was performed on all animals at three occasions, before treatment, on Days 1 
and 29 of treatment at 1 hour post dose (±15 mins) and during Week 8 of the treatment-free period. There 
were no treatment-related effects on any of the neurobehavioural parameters investigated.  
The safety pharmacology endpoint assessments (Study VMM0008 and Study VMM0033) did not lead to any 
changes for either cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system measurements.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with durvalumab.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies were performed, but kinetic samples were taken in all the in vivo 
toxicity studies. A comprehensive evaluation of the PK/TK and PK/PD relationships was reported by referring 
to the four toxicity studies conducted in cynomolgus monkey: 
•  302833; A PK/PD dose range finding study (Non-GLP). 
•  VMM0008; A four weeks toxicity study with eight-weeks recovery period (GLP). 
•  VMM0033; A thirteen weeks toxicity study with eight-weeks recovery period (GLP). 
•  8291365; ePPND study (GLP). 
302833: The study design involved dosing at pharmacologically relevant doses (0.1 or 1 mg/kg durvalumab) 
on Day 1, followed by 2 weeks off dose and then repeat dosing at potential toxicologically relevant doses (10 
or 100 mg/kg) on Day 15, 22, and 29.. Animals were immunized with 10 mg Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin 
(KLH) on Day 1 and 29 to monitor potential effects of durvalumab on the antibody response to a T cell-
dependent antigen. Non-linear kinetics was evident between doses 0.1 and 1 mg/kg due to target-mediated 
drug disposition as expected, but also between 10 and 100 mg/kg. The nonlinear PK at 10 and 100 mg/kg 
correlated with all animals in the low dose group and 4 out of 5 animals in the high dose group were tested 
positive for antidrug antibodies. Regarding pharmacodynamics, almost complete suppression of sPD-L1 was 
observed after the first dose (including 0.1 mg/kg). The target suppression was dose dependent but also time 
dependent, as after the last dose, target suppression decreased faster than after the first dose. A similar 
outcome was observed for the membrane bound PD-L1, measured by flow cytometry. Almost complete 
occupancy (>97%) after the first dose of durvalumab was observed in animals administered a low dose of 
0.1 mg/kg, a complete suppression of target can be achieved at a plasma concentration of approximately 2 
µg/mL serum (C0 = 1.77 µg/ml for 0.1 mg/kg) in the absence of antidrug antibodies in monkeys.

VMM0008: Dosing was initiated with a loading dose in order to minimize formation of antidrug antibodies 
leading to the following dose groups: 30/15, 60/30 and 200/100 mg/kg administered one week apart. 
Exposure was linear between the doses on Day 1 and was consistent with 100 mg/kg dose in study 302833. 
The clearance was lower and t½ higher compared to study 302833, as these doses were designed to be in the 
linear segment (target mediated clearance saturated) of the previously tested dose range of durvalumab. 
Volume of distribution was consistent with plasma volume and data from study 302833. The number of 
animals that tested positive for presence of ADA increased with time. Prior to the last dose (Day 29), 11 of 12 
animals in the 30/15 mg/kg dose group tested positive for the presence of ADA. The number of animals that 
tested positive for presence of ADA on Day 29 was lower in the 60/30 and 200/100 mg/kg dose groups (5 of

12 animals in each group). Anti-drug antibodies in animals treated with durvalumab persisted throughout the 
8-week recovery period. By the end of the recovery period, ADA was detectable in all animals in Groups 2 
and 3 and in 4 of 6 animals in Group 4. The presence of ADA had variable impact on pharmacokinetics and 
PK data from animals with obvious impact of ADAs were excluded from summary statistics calculations. ADAs 
were not detected in any sample from any control animal (Group 1).The PD measure sPD-L1 was suppressed 
from Day 1 to day 32 in 9 out of 12 animals in group 2 (30/15 mg/kg), in all animals in group 3 (60/30 
mg/kg) and in 11 out of 12 animals in group 4 (200/100 mg/kg). 
VMM0033: In-study pharmacokinetic linearity was demonstrated on Day 1. Comparable AUCT between 
VMM0033 and 8291365 is observed, whereas a factor of 1.4, 1.4 and 1.6 fold increase is observed for the 
three dose levels 30, 60 and 200 mg/kg, respectively, between VMM0008 and VMM0033. The only difference 
between the studies, was the age of the animals, consequently the weight was higher and therefore also the 
dose. The older animals, which showed higher exposure, were of higher body weight, especially the males. 
Clearance was determined in VMM0008 and in 8291365, the ePPND study using sexually mature female 
animals. Clearance was determined to be higher in the young animals used in study VMM0008 (6-7 
mL/kg/day) and lower in study 8291365 (3 L/kg/day). Thirty-three percent (33%, 4 of 12 animals) of the 
control Group 1 animals were positive for ADA. 
8291365: Pregnant females received a loading dose (double the maintenance dose) of 60 or 200 mg/kg 
durvalumab by IV infusion upon confirmation of pregnancy on gestation day 20 (GD20). This was followed by 
weekly doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg durvalumab from GD27 until delivery. Control animals received vehicle 
following the same dosing schedule. Transfer of durvalumab from dam to infant was shown to occur during 
gestation and demonstrates the existence of a placental transfer mechanism. Also durvalumab excretion into 
milk in lactating mothers was demonstrated, although in low concentration not anticipated to induce 
pharmacological activity in infants. The serum concentrations in infants was likely due to placental transfer 
illustrated by the relatively high and pharmacological relevant mean serum concentrations of 7.85 and 42.2 
µg/mL at day 90 post partum.  
In general, after the first dose of durvalumab, a biphasic decline in serum durvalumab concentration was 
reported. The highest durvalumab concentrations were achieved by the end of product infusion. Median Tmax 
for all dose levels ranged from 1.5 to 6 hours post dose. Mean elimination half-life estimated for the 
concentration declined out to 7 days post dose and was approximately 6 to 8 days. In the 13 week repeated 
dose study Cmax and AUCτ, was approximately dose proportional to dose from 30- to 200 mg/kg with a mean 
accumulation ratio of 1.56 to 1.91. 
Table 3 lists selected pharmacokinetic parameters from Day 1 of all studies conducted with durvalumab. Vz 
and Clearance were not reported for VMM0033 and 8291365, however comparing data from VMM0008 with 
302833, dose dependent changes in clearance and t½ is demonstrated due to target mediated clearance at 
lower doses, whereas volume of distribution is largely conserved over the whole dose range of 0.1 to 200 
mg/kg as expected.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology package completed with durvalumab is considered in accordance with ICH S6(R1) 
and ICH S9 guidance. The IV route of administration was used for all in vivo toxicology studies as this is the 
intended route of administration.  
The cynomolgus monkey was found to be the only pharmacological relevant nonclinical species for evaluation 
of local and systemic toxicities of durvalumab.

Studies 302833, VMM0008 and VMM0033 
The main aims of the non-GLP PK/PD and DRF toxicity study (Study 302833) were to determine the PK/PD 
relationship and a preliminary toxicity profile of durvalumab upon IV bolus administration. Scheduled 
necropsies were carried out on Day 39 and tissues were taken for microscopic analysis. 
Two GLP repeat-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with durvalumab, a 4-week (Study VMM0008) and a 
13-week (Study VMM0033) repeat-dose toxicity study. To mitigate the high incidence of immunogenicity and 
ADA-mediated adverse effects observed in the non-GLP repeat-dose toxicity study (Study 302833), in both 
studies a loading dose (double the maintenance dose) of 30, 60, or 200 mg/kg durvalumab was administered 
on Day 1, and followed by 4 or 13 weekly doses of 15, 30, or 100 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, animals 
were dosed by 30 min IV infusion rather than IV bolus administration to reduce the risk of anaphylactic 
reactions. The majority of animals were tested positive for ADAs, however, exposure was maintained in most 
animals and serum levels of sPD-L1 were generally fully suppressed within 24 hours following the first 
administration of durvalumab and throughout the dosing period for both studies. 
Table 6 below lists the findings, considered to be drug related in the DRF study 302833 and the two GLP 
pivotal toxicity studies VMM0008 and VMM0033.

Clinical observations: Male 645 (200/100 
mg/kg durvalumab) presented with rash on 
the legs, ears, arms, ocular regions, and 
head and had red stained urine beginning on 
Day 29 shortly following administration of 
the final dose of 100 mg/kg durvalumab. Red 
stained urine was also observed in the home 
cage of this animal on Day 30. The rash had 
completely resolved by Day 32. There were 
no toxicology significant findings in the 
remaining animals. 
Gross pathology: small thymus in all animals 
administered 200/100 mg/kg durvalumab. 
Enlarged kidneys for Male 645 (200/100 
mg/kg durvalumab). 
Organ weights: thymi of animals 
administered 200/100 mg/kg of durvalumab 
were generally of lower weight than 
concurrent controls (without reaching 
statistical significance). There were no 
treatment-related changes in the remaining 
animals. 
Microscopic pathology: slight to moderate 
reduction in cellularity of the thymic cortex in 
some animals (1 of 3 M and 2 of 3 F) in 
200/100-mg/kg dose group, which was 
absent in animals examined after the 8-week 
treatment-free period. Bilateral, marked, 
tubular ischemic necrosis and multifocal 
vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis (one with a 
small thrombus) in Male 645 (200/100-
mg/kg dose group). This animal also had 
inflammation in the choroid plexus, a 
medium-sized artery in the heart, in a 
complex of vessels in one epididymis, and 
slight inflammatory cell infiltration in the 
section of sciatic nerve. 
Microscopic pathology: In the thymus, an 
increase in incidence and/or severity of 
involution/atrophy (cortex and medulla or 
cortex) was observed in males and females.

Microscopic pathology: In the thymus, an 
increase in incidence and/or severity of 
involution/atrophy (cortex and medulla or

In the mesenteric lymph node, decreased 
germinal center development was noted in 
two males treated at 200/100 
mg/kg/occasion. Following the 8-week 
treatment-free period, no difference from 
control was observed in either of these 
tissues. These findings were not associated 
with any changes in peripheral-blood T cells 
counts, were considered to have an uncertain 
relationship to treatment and given their 
incidence or severity, if they were related to 
treatment, they were considered not to be 
adverse.  
The selection of the high dose in all three studies is therefore also accepted as NOAEL (200/100 mg/kg) in 
the pivotal toxicity studies.

Reproduction Toxicity 
To assess the potential effects of durvalumab on embryofetal and postnatal development, an ePPND study 
(Study 8291365) was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant females were administered durvalumab 
IV from confirmation of pregnancy (GD20) until parturition, and development of the infants was monitored in 
a 6-month postnatal phase, which included an assessment of immune-competence of the infants by inclusion 
of a challenge with a T cell-dependent antigen (KLH).

Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics (TK) was monitored in all three toxicity studies including ADA and pharmacological relevant 
biomarkers. Based on study 302833, the doses chosen for the pivotal toxicity studies were all in the 
pharmacokinetic linear range which was confirmed by toxicokinetics. As no gender differences were 
determined in the studies, TK was pooled across sex. Accumulation of durvalumab in repeat dose studies was 
lower or as expected (theoretical accumulation ratio is approximately 1.8) for the selected dosing schedule 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 33/143 
 
 
 
 
(QW) and observed half-life (approximately 6 days). Maximum accumulation ratio observed was 1.9, which is 
very close to the theoretical value. 
Exemplifying and assessing impact of antidrug antibodies on TK can be done using the table of accumulation 
ratios from the TK report of VMM0008. The exposure after day 15 was severely impacted in the low dose 
group, but seems to be reliable in group 3 and 4 until Day 29. See Table 10 of accumulation ratios below: 
Table 10: Individual Accumulation ratios determined using AUCτ and Cmax (VMM0008). 
A more direct way of determining validity of the toxicity study with antidrug antibodies, is to monitor target 
occupancy. Soluble PD-L1 was below Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in all animals in group 3, all except 
animal 645 up to day 29 in group 4, which correlates with toxicokinetics. In group 2, three animals showed 
signs of neutralising antibodies as sPD-L1 increased to near normal levels in the third week of the study.  
A few samples obtained pre-study initiation (week-3 samples), were determined ADA positive: 631 group 3, 
negative day 8, positive thereafter, 645 group 4, positive thereafter, 646 group 4, negative thereafter. One 
sample from group 1 were tested ADA positive in this study: 609 Day 56 of recovery.

A similar picture was observed for the 13-week toxicity study with decreasing number of animals with PK 
affected by ADAs for higher doses.

Local Tolerance  
A dedicated local tolerance study with durvalumab was not conducted. Injection sites were evaluated as part 
of the repeat-dose toxicity studies with durvalumab in cynomolgus monkeys (Studies 302833, VMM0008, and 
VMM0033). In the non-GLP PK/PD and DRF toxicity study with durvalumab (Study 302833), local tolerance 
was assessed by microscopic evaluation of the IV injection site 10 days after the final dose. In the GLP 4- and 
13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies with durvalumab (Studies VMM0008 and VMM0033), local tolerance at 
the IV infusion site was assessed by dermal Draize evaluation throughout the dosing period and by 
microscopic evaluation of the injection site 3 days after the final dose. 
Arteritis/periarteritis, subcutaneous inflammation, subcutaneous haemorrhage and thrombus were observed 
at the injection sites (left and right saphenous veins) of treated animals and controls in study Study 
VMM0033. Occasional incidences of bruising, oedema, erythema and acanthosis were recorded at the 
injection sites. The Applicant stated that all of these signs were observed in both control and treated animals 
and there was no evidence of an increase in severity, incidence or duration in treated animals and these signs 
are therefore considered to be related to the injection procedure and not associated with treatment with 
durvalumab.  
Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross reactivity (TCR studies 20014789 and 20014791) was studied in a panel of tissues from humans 
and cynomolgus monkeys. In human tissues, staining with durvalumab was present in the membrane and 
cytoplasm of mononuclear cells and trophoblastic epithelium. Cytoplasmic staining only was also present with 
durvalumab in pituitary epithelium. In the placenta, durvalumab stained extracellular proteinaceous material. 
PD-L1 expression has been reported in mononuclear cells, including dendritic cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
and macrophages and placenta trophoblasts. The soluble form of PD-L1 may account for the staining of 
extracellular proteinaceous material in the placenta. The expression of PD-L1 has not specifically been 
reported in pituitary epithelium; however, other epithelial cell types have been reported to express PD-L1. 
TCR in cynomolgus monkey showed similar staining patterns as compared to human tissues.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Durvalumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to 
the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), durvalumab is exempt from preparation of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the 
environment.

EMA/548232/2018 
Page 35/143 
 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Durvalumab was found to only bind to human and cynomolgus monkey PD-L1, and the cynomolgus monkey 
was found to be the only relevant nonclinical species for the safety and toxicity studies. For the PD studies, 
either a model of immunodeficient mice inoculated with a mixture of human tumour cell lines expressing B7-
H1 (PD-L1) and human T-cells alloreactive to the human tumour cell lines or in a syngeneic mouse model 
using a mouse surrogate monoclonal antibody against mouse PD-L1. Both models showed dose related 
tumour reducing effects and in vivo proof of concept is accepted.  
In the set of in vitro studies, the binding affinity and specificity of Durvalumab with the proposed target, i.e. 
human PD-L1, was calculated. In this regard, the action of Durvalumab (nM range) on hPD-L1 was reported 
by inhibiting the binding to its ligands, both hPD-1 and hCD80 receptors. This action was also estimated in T 
cells obtained from donors. In this assay, the serum concentration of Durvalumab with 90% of the maximal 
response observed was 3 µg/mL. As PD-L1 mechanism of action is to re-activate the host immune response 
to tumours overexpressing PD-L1, there is also a risk that autoimmune reactions could be stimulated 
following treatment with durvalumab. 
No dedicated PK studies were performed, but samples for PK/TK were taken in the DRF toxicity study as well 
as in the pivotal toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Durvalumab administration resulted in Cmax 
generally reached after fist dose. A relatively dose proportional increase of AUC was seen at low doses and 
with a more than dose proportional increase a high doses (100x). This non-linear PK at high doses may be 
influenced by a saturable target-mediated clearance which is not unexpected in antibodies that have 
membrane targets. A very high variability exposure was reported with increased dose frequency and this 
variability is attributed to the high presence of ADAs when the last dose is administered. PK variability was 
reduced in those animals that did not present ADA formation. Durvalumab administration resulted in total 
suppression of free sPD-L1 as expected due to the pharmacology of the product. Almost complete occupancy 
(> 97%) of membrane PD-L1 in various cell subsets CD4+ also on CD8+ lymphocytes and CD14+ 
monocytes. Maximal suppression was seen from dose of 0.1mg/kg. Although the first doses resulted in free 
sPD-L1 suppression, this was later diminished or abolished after repeated administration due to the presence 
of ADAs. Not surprisingly ADA formation increased with time. 
Durvalumab was administered by the intravenous route in pivotal toxicity studies, therefore the applicant did 
not evaluate absorption. Distribution studies were not conducted for durvalumab which is acceptable as 
according to ICH S6(R1), distribution studies are not needed for monoclonal antibodies. It should be noted 
that the volume of distribution is in the range of 40.5 to 73.0 mL/kg, which is expected for large protein 
molecules as these primarily resides in the plasma volume. The absence of classical distribution studies are 
considered acceptable. No studies of metabolism or excretion of durvalumab have been conducted. According 
to ICH S6(R1), the expected metabolism and clearance of monoclonal antibodies is degradation to small 
peptides and individual amino acids, which are taken up by the body and incorporated into other proteins or 
catabolised. Therefore, the metabolism and clearance pathways are generally understood. Classical 
biotransformation and excretion studies are therefore not needed. 
In the toxicity studies where safety pharmacology endpoints were included, no clinically relevant adverse 
effects were observed. Two monkeys showed ADA-associated reactions, one which died in the non-GLP DRF 
study, and one animal in the 4 week toxicity study showed clinical signs and histopathological findings 
consistent with immune complex depositions. Further to the submission of an additional study designed to 
assess this issue together with information from published literature, it was considered that immune complex 
deposition is the plausible cause of  enlarged kidneys and potentially responsible as well of the epididymis

Page 36/143 
 
toxicity reported. These findings in the nonclinical studies were not considered to be predictive of the 
potential for clinical adverse reactions, as human immunogenicity is not well predicted in the nonclinical 
setting.  
As reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by 
maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus, and in mouse allogeneic pregnancy models disruption 
of PD-L1 signalling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. In animal reproduction studies, 
administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of pregnancy through 
delivery, at exposure levels approximately 18 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 
10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC), was associated with placental transfer but not with maternal 
toxicity or effects on embryofoetal development, pregnancy outcome or postnatal development. Negligible 
levels of durvalumab were found in milk of cynomolgous monkey on Day 28 after birth (see sections 4.6 and 
5.3 of the SmPC). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for the 
marketing authorisation application for durvalumab, were considered adequate and acceptable for the 
assessment of non-clinical aspects. The lack of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, fertility and early embryonic 
development was well justified.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The PK of durvalumab has been investigated in patients enrolled in the Phase 3 study D4191C00001 
(hereafter referred to as PACIFIC), in the Phase 1/2 study CD-ONMEDI4736-1108 (hereafter referred to as 
Study 1108), and in the Phase 2 study D4191C00003 (hereafter referred to as ATLANTIC) following 
administration by IV infusion.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of durvalumab was studied in 1902 patients with solid tumours with doses ranging from 0.1 to 20 
mg/kg administered intravenously once every two, three or four weeks.  
Analytical  methods:  The  immuno-assays  for  quantification  of  durvalumab  and  soluble  PD-L1  in  human 
serum samples were adequately validated.  
The flow cytometry methods for quantification of T, B, NK cells and for quantification of proliferating T cells in 
human whole blood, were only partly validated and included inter-assay precision, short-term stability and 
drug tolerance. The immuno-assays for detection of ADAs, neutralising anti-bodies and for ADAs specific to 
TM were all qualitative methods and the testing limited. The nAb assay was tested for selectivity as matrix 
interference in serum from healthy individuals and cancer patients. The ADA methods were not tested for 
matrix interference as this had been accounted for in the cut point calculation based on serum from patients 
with different types of cancer.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis: No single dose study has been conducted with durvalumab. Non-
compartmental analysis (NCA) was used to analyse the PK of multiple dose durvalumab in study 1108. 
Sparse PK samples (Ctrough) were available from the ATLANTIC and PACIFIC study conducted in patients with 
NSCLC. A Pop PK model has been developed with data from the 3 clinical studies: PACIFIC, Study 1108, and 
ATLANTIC. The PopPK model has been validated with 679 patients with 3408 samples from PACIFIC and 
Study 1108 with at least 1 new PK sample that were not used for the previous PK model development. All 
studies included male and female patients ≥18 years of age with advanced solid tumours. The ATLANTIC and 
PACIFIC studies were conducted in patients with NSCLC. No PK data are available in healthy volunteers.  
The population PK modelling was used to describe durvalumab serum concentrations in patients (NSCLC and 
other solid tumours) and to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in special populations based on patients’ 
baseline characteristics.   
The durvalumab final population PK model was externally validated with 679 patients with 3408 samples from 
PACIFIC and Study 1108 with at least 1 PK sample that was not used in the model development.

Absorption  
Durvalumab is administered intravenously and the bioavailability 100 %. 
Bioequivalence 
No bioequivalence studies have been conducted. Full comparability has been demonstrated between the 
formulation used in the clinical studies and the product to be commercialized. 
Distribution 
Distribution studies were not conducted for durvalumab.  
The population PK model adequately described durvalumab PK profiles. A 2-compartmental population PK 
model with both linear and Michaelis Menten nonlinear elimination components was initially developed for 
patients across all dose levels and was later updated to a final population PK model with linear elimination at 
doses doses ≥10 mg/kg Q2W IV in a posthoc analysis. 
Based on this final model, the mean systemic linear CL and central volume of distribution (V1) were 0.266 
L/day and 3.51 L with a modest between-patient variability of 27.3% and 22.1% expressed as CV%, 
respectively. Based on the analysis population that included all of the patients in the final model development 
and in the external validation (1878 patients), the geometric mean (CV%) Vss was 5.64 L (17.6%).  
The PK parameters estimated by popPK analysis were consistent with the non-compartmental analysis in 
study 1108.

The estimates of AUCss, Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss following durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W were predicted in the 
Pop PK analysis to be: AUCss (ug*day/mL):3816 [1562,17800], Cmax,ss (µg/mL) 364.1 [200.4,1221] and 
Cmin,ss (µg/mL) 160 [55.4,839.2]. 
Elimination 
No studies regarding durvalumab metabolism have been conducted. No mass balance studies have been 
conducted. The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial 
system (RES) or target-mediated disposition.  Durvalumab is not metabolized in the liver and not subject to 
elimination by P450 enzymes.  
For the 3 studies (PACIFIC, Study 1108 and ATLANTIC), the durvalumab serum PK data at the durvalumab 
dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W IV were similar (Figure 4).   
The Km estimate was 0.533 mg/L (95% CI: 0.072 – 1.58 mg/L). Vmax was 0.931 mg/day. Durvalumab 
clearance (CL) decreased over time resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.16 mL/h 
at Day 365; the decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The terminal half-life (t1/2), based on 
baseline CL, was approximately 18 days. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. 
Exposure-response 
The Exposure-response evaluation was conducted with data from the PACIFIC study where all patients were 
treated with the same durvalumab dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W and PK sampling was sparse. The exposure 
parameters were simulated from the POP PK model. 
The final pop PK model included time varying clearance. A semi-mechanistic model including disease state 
variable such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), albumin (ALB) and tumour 
size supported a biological explanation for the deceased clearance as a matter of improvements in diseases 
state over time. The higher exposure as a result of the time dependent decrease in clearance of 
approximately 23 % is not associated with a higher incidence of AEs.

Inter-individual variability in the target population was moderate (CL CV=27.3% and V1 CV=22.1%) and the 
intra-subject variability also relatively small (proportional residual error σ1 (CV%) and the additive error 
standard deviation σ2 (CV%) 21.3% (2.2%) and 4.91 µg/mL (13%), respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
The PK time profile of the low-dose cohorts in the dose-escalation phase of Study 1108 (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 
mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg) show a faster CL. Following the first IV dose, mean maximum serum concentration 
following the first dose (Cmax1) increased in a dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 20 
mg/kg (Table 13).  Exposure levels at 20 mg/kg Q4W provide similar AUCss levels as 10 mg/kg Q2W over a 
period of 28 days, but a higher Cmax to Ctrough ratio. Mean area under the concentration-time curve from time 
0 to 14 days (AUC0-14) increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner with doses <3 mg/kg and 
reached linearity at dose  3 mg/kg Q2W.

Time dependency 
Accumulation of durvalumab was observed following repeated dosing. The mean Cmax_ss and Ctrough,ss 
increased in an approximately more than dose-proportional manner at doses ≤1 mg/kg Q2W. Accumulation 
of durvalumab was evaluated by the ratio of steady state Cmax and Ctrough (on Day 84 or beyond) to those at 
first dose.  Following 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W dose, the mean accumulation ratio for Cmax (ARCmax) from the 
first to eighth dose ranged from 0.64 to 1.87, whereas mean accumulation ratio for Ctrough (ARCtrough) ranged 
from 3.16 to 4.93.

In the Pop PK analysis a statistically significant decrease in durvalumab linear clearance (CL) was observed 
over time with a mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from baseline values of 
approximately 22.9% (46.3%) resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance CLss (CV%) of 8.24 mL/h 
(37.3%). The time-varying clearance was included in the updated pop PK model (model 2).  
The decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant since changes in PK parameters ((AUCss, Cmax,ss, 
and Cmin,ss) were <30% for a typical patient with time-varying CL (reduced CL with an estimate of Tmax = -
0.270) compared to a typical patient with time-independent CL (Tmax = 0, CL = 0.266).

Special populations 
The effect of intrinsic factors (i.e., race, age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, sex, and body weight) 
on the PK of durvalumab has not been studied through specific dedicated studies. 
The popPK analysis indicated that body weight, sex, post-baseline ADA, CLCR, ECOG/WHO performance 
status, LDH level, soluble PD L1 levels, tumour type, and ALB were statistically significant covariates, but no 
change in exposure parameters (AUC, Cmin, Cmax) was more than 30%. None were considered clinically 
relevant on key PK exposure metrics of durvalumab at steady state (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss).

Impaired renal function:  
Mild and moderate renal impairment did not affect the PK of durvalumab. No patients with severe renal 
impairment were included. Based on the population PK analysis performed on patients with normal (n=609, 
46.4%, CRCL ≥ 90 mL/min), mild (n=522, 39.8%, CRCL=60-89 mL/min), moderate (n=179, 13.6%, CRCL = 
30-59 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (n=2, 0.2%, CRCL=30-59 mL/min), the effect of CRCL was not 
identified as having a clinically relevant impact on durvalumab PK since it did not change PK parameters and 
exposure parameters by more than 30% from a typical patient (defined with median CRCL of 87.32 mL/min). 
The updated, final population PK model confirmed that the impact of CLCR on durvalumab PK was not clinically 
relevant, with an effect of no more than −6% to +5%, −4% to +3%, or −8% to +6% on AUCss, Cmax,ss, and 
Cmin,ss, respectively. 
Impaired hepatic function:  
The majority of patients in the clinical studies had normal hepatic function. Mild hepatic impairment does not 
appear to affect clearance and no dose adjustment is required for this population. No effect of aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin (BIL) on durvalumab PK was 
observed in the population PK analysis in solid tumours.  
Based on the population PK analysis performed on patients included all of the patients included in the final 
model development (Model 2) and in the external validation (n=1878) with normal hepatic function (n=1598 
[85.1%], BIL ≤upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST ≤ULN), mild hepatic impairment (n=255 [13.6%], BIL ≤
ULN and AST >ULN, or BIL >1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), moderate hepatic impairment (n=3 [0.16%], BIL 
>1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST), no clinically relevant effect of hepatic function was noticeable on the PK of 
durvalumab. This is supported by the covariate analysis of the PK model of durvalumab that showed no 
statistically significant impact of hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT, and BIL) on either CL, V1, or V2 of durvalumab. 
Gender:  
Sex was found to be a strong predictor of CL, V1, and V2 of durvalumab, with females having a 13.4% (95% 
CI: 10% – 17.5%) lower CL than males, a 16.4% (13.5% – 19.2%) lower V1 than males, and a 23.4% (95% 
CI: 16.3% – 29.6%) lower V2 than males. The updated, final population PK model (Model 2) confirmed the 
impact of sex on durvalumab PK.  Females had +16%, +18%, and +16% higher AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss, 
respectively, compared to males. 
Weight:  
Dosing of durvalumab is weight based, but no capping of dose has been suggested. For body weight, despite 
a combined effect of increased CL and V1 with increasing body weight, this did not translate into more than a 
30% difference in AUCss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss with -17%, -17%, and -18%, respectively, for the 10th percentile 
patient (body weight = 51 kg) compared to a typical patient (body weight = 69.15 kg) and +21%, +21%, 
and +23% for the 90th percentile patient (body weight = 93.4 kg) compared to a typical patient (body 
weight = 69.15 kg) for AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss, respectively. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentile were 45 kg 
and 111 kg, respectively. Exposure in subjects with extreme body weight was assessed. Expected differences 
in exposure for obese patients (BMI>30) was compared to the typical patient. The observed/predicted 
exposure exceeds the 90% exposure range covered in the exposure-response analysis: Males: AUCss (NA), 
Cmaxss (54%), Cminss (88.1%) and Females: AUCss (66.2%), Cmaxss (73.6/78.6%%), Cminss (100/99.9%).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

potential of durvalumab is unknown.   
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No in vitro permeability, in vitro metabolism, or in vitro metabolic drug-drug interaction studies that used 
human biomaterials were performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD L1) 
and blocks its interaction with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cluster of differentiation (CD)80 (B7.1).  
The binding of durvalumab to PD-L1 inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 receptors 
expressed on immune cells. This activity overcomes PD-L1-mediated inhibition of antitumor immunity. 
Durvalumab does not have ADCC or CDC activity due to the triple mutation in the Fc domain, confirmed in 
the cellular cytotoxicity studies. PD-L1 binding is completely saturated at therapeutic durvalumab 
concentrations and no increase in durvalumab concentration is therefore expected to cause cytokine release. 
Durvalumab at concentrations up to 300 μg/mL, did not induce cytokine release in a whole blood assay from 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 48/143 
 
 
any healthy human donor. No cytokine release syndrome or ADCC/CDC induced cytotoxicity is therefore 
expected even at Cmax concentrations >  300 µg/mL. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology  
IPD markers: 
In study 1108, target engagement was assessed through measurement of reduction in levels of free soluble 
PD-L1  (sPDL1)  in  serum  as  a  peripheral  pharmacodynamics  marker.  Following  administration  of  0.1  to  20 
mg/kg durvalumab, sPD-L1 concentrations were maximally suppressed at Day 14 (or after the first dose) for 
all doses except 0.1 mg/kg.  
*sPD-L1 was highly variable at day 42 since SUBJID (3mg/kg Q2W) was ADA positive with high titer value of 4.96 
Figure 8: Mean (SD) sPD-L1 serum Concentration profiles measured at Ctrough by cohort following IV 
administration of durvalumab 
The extent and duration of the suppression was dose dependent. Following administration of durvalumab, 
complete sPD-L1 suppression was observed around the dose levels at 0.3 mg/kg.  Following 10 mg/kg Q2W, 
approximately 97% of patients demonstrated complete sPD-L1 suppression throughout the dosing interval.  
Suppression of free sPD-L1 was similar among 10 mg/kg Q2W, 15 mg/kg Q3W, and 20 mg/kg Q4W cohorts. 
An additional objective was to explore CD8+Ki67+ T cells as potential markers of the biological activity of PD-
L1 blockade by durvalumab.

Inmunogenicity: 
Across the 3 studies, durvalumab demonstrated a 2.9% (45 of 1570 patients; antidrug antibody [ADA] 
evaluable population) ADA incidence (treatment emergent ADAs [ie, treatment-induced ADA plus treatment-
boosted ADA]) with no clinically significant effect on PK following 10 mg/kg Q2W IV dose across tumor types. 
There was no clear evidence that the presence of ADA or neutralizing antibodies (nAb) had any potential 
impact on safety but ADA increased durvalumab CL by 23.8% and decreased AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss by 
19%, 12% and 25%, respectively, for a typical patient.  The median titer of the treatment emergent ADA-
positive patients was 4 %. nABs was detected in 8 of 1570 patients (0.5 %). 
Exposure-efficacy relationship: 
The PFS Kaplan-Meier curves in the durvalumab-treated patients stratified by model predicted exposures at 
steady state and overlaid with patients in the placebo group are presented in Error! Reference source not 
found.. Durvalumab treatment led to longer PFS compared to placebo. Patients with AUCss and Cmin,ss 
exposure above the median had slightly longer PFS compared to those with exposure below the median.

Figure 10: Progression-free survival profiles stratified by durvalumab exposure categories 
In order to assess whether the time-varying CL is a confounding factor on the exposure response 
relationship, the relationship between PFS and AUCss with the change in CL over time was examined. The 
results suggest that larger percent reductions in time-varying CL were associated with longer PFS; however, 
greater percent reductions in durvalumab CL were also associated with higher AUCss.  Therefore, the trend of 
longer PFS with higher AUCss is attributed to the PK being confounded by the decreased durvalumab CL in 
patients benefitting from the treatment. 
A small trend of a longer PFS with higher AUCss was found

Exposure-safety relationship: 
Safety endpoints (Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AE, grade 3 or 4 drug-related AESI, AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation, and incidence of pneumonitis) were binary responses (yes/no). No exposure-response 
relationship was observed for the selected AEs based on the durvalumab-treated patients in PACIFIC. 
An electrocardiography (ECG) study of patients enrolled in cohort 2 of ATLANTIC was conducted and included 
the study of ECG interval changes from baseline, categorical outlier values, and potential relationships 
between drug concentration and QTcF interval change. Modelling results did not identify a significant linear 
relationship between durvalumab concentrations and ∆QTcF.  The mean change of QTcF from baseline was 
around 2 ms. These results indicate that durvalumab does not have an effect on QTcF and other ECG 
parameters in patients who have EGFR/ALK wild type NSCLC. 
The PK-QT analysis supports that no QT prolongation or other ECG changes were seen for the proposed 
dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg QW, but cannot exclude QT prolongation at higher doses and concentrations.

Dose rationale 
A durvalumab monotherapy dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W IV was used in Studies PACIFIC, 1108, and ATLANTIC 
and no other doses have been investigated in clinical trials. At the 10 mg/kg dose, no dose limiting toxicities 
were observed. In vitro studies have identified the target concentration, which is translated to human target 
exposure levels. 
The 10 mg/kg dose was chosen to ensure a mean trough concentration of 50 µg/mL. The Km estimate from 
the Pop PK model was 0.533 mg/L (95% CI: 0.072 – 1.58 mg/L) and the target concentration of 53.3 µg/mL 
was based on 100 fold of the Km estimate. A target concentration of >53.3 µg/mL would in theory translate 
into >99 % target saturation in serum, and simulations of the proposed dose has indicated that 95.4 % of 
patients will have Ctrough above 53.3 µg/mL and 78.6 % Ctrough above >100 µg/mL. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD L1) 
and blocks its interaction with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cluster of differentiation (CD)80 (B7.1).  
The immunoassays used for durvalumab quantification were adequately specific and validated. Development 
of antibodies against durvalumab was measured throughout the clinical program. 
The multiple-dose PK of durvalumab monotherapy has been investigated in three clinical studies. All studies 
included male and female patients ≥18 years of age with advanced solid tumours. The ATLANTIC and PACIFIC 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 54/143 
 
 
studies were conducted in patients with NSCLC. No PK data are available in healthy volunteers. No single-
dose PK studies with durvalumab have been conducted, which is acceptable for an anticancer product. 
A Pop PK model has been developed with data from the clinical studies: Study 1108, and ATLANTIC. Linear 
distribution and elimination processes were assumed in the two-compartment model, including a time-
varying effect on CL (using a sigmoid function) in order to characterize the decrease in CL over time. The 
final pop PK model included time varying clearance. The time dependent decrease in clearance of 
approximately 23 % is a result of change in disease state where the clearance of the immune inhibitor 
decreases over time as the patient’s disease state improves due to less inflammation and lower protein 
catabolism. No safety concerns were identified related to the higher exposure. 
The final population PK model of durvalumab adequately described the PK data and inter and intra individual 
variability of the patients in PACIFIC and Study 1108, suggesting the PK characteristics of durvalumab in 
NSCLC patients in PACIFIC was consistent with that in previous studies. Inter and intra- individual variability 
was moderate. 
Several covariates were included in CL, Vc and Vp with the aim of partially explaining the inter-individual 
variability on durvalumab’s PK. An external validation was performed including new individuals that were not 
used during model development. Bias and precision of model predictions were computed, showing no 
significant bias and 10% imprecision on model predictions. According to the results from pc-VPC, the 
population PK model developed is able to reproduce the observations after the administration of durvalumab. 
The population PK modelling was used to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in special populations based 
on patients’ baseline characteristics. 1283 of the 1324 patients included in the pop PK analyses received the 
durvalumab 10 mg Q2W regimen. The final model was updated with exclusion of data <10 mg/kg given very 
low number of patients, removal of non-linear CL, and incorporation of time varying CL. 
Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was used to analyse the PK of multiple dose durvalumab in study 1108. 
Durvalumab exhibited nonlinear PK at doses <3 mg/kg Q2W, likely due to saturable target-mediated 
elimination of the antibody, and approached linearity at doses ≥3 mg/kg Q2W. The PK parameters estimated 
by popPK analysis were consistent with the non-compartmental analyses. The pharmacokinetic parameters 
are overall in agreement with what have previously been defined for other IgG medicinal products. 
The Exposure-response evaluation was conducted with data from the PACIFIC study where all patients were 
treated with the same durvalumab dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W and PK sampling was sparse. The exposure 
parameters were simulated from the POP PK model. 
Full comparability has been demonstrated between the formulation used in the clinical studies and the 
product to be commercialized, and no bioequivalence studies have been conducted (see section 2.2 Quality 
aspects).  
The geometric mean steady state volume of distribution of durvalumab is 5.64 litres indicating that 
durvalumab is mostly confined to the blood compartment. Durvalumab, being an IgG antibody is not 
expected to bind to plasma proteins. 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin and not subject to metabolism by P450 enzymes. No 
studies regarding durvalumab metabolism have been conducted and none are required in line with ICH SA6. 
No mass balance studies have been conducted. The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein 
catabolism via RES or target-mediated disposition. Linear PK is seen at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg due to target-
mediated drug disposition. Clearance is small (8.16 mL/h) as expected of an IgG antibody. Half-life is 
approximately 18 days. Steady state was achieved at approximately Week 16 after repeated dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 55/143 
 
Dose proportionality is seen for durvalumab at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg. Lower doses had higher clearance likely due 
to target-mediated elimination. A dose above 3 mg/kg is supported.  
The estimates of AUCss, Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss following durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W were predicted in the 
Pop PK analysis to be: AUCss (ug*day/mL):3816 [1562,17800], Cmax,ss (µg/mL) 364.1 [200.4,1221] and 
Cmin,ss (µg/mL) 160 [55.4,839.2]. 
Potential covariates of durvalumab pharmacokinetics were evaluated by popPK analysis. The popPK analysis 
indicated  that  body  weight,  sex,  post-baseline  ADA,  CLCR,  ECOG/WHO  performance  status,  LDH  level  , 
soluble PD L1 levels, tumour type, and ALB were statistically significant covariates, but none had changed PK 
exposure  parameters  (AUC,  Cmin,  Cmax)  by  more  than  30%.  Several  covariates  (body  weight,  ADA  status, 
albumin, UC type) modified exposure parameters around 20 %. 
Durvalumab  is  a  human  monoclonal  immunoglobulin  and  not  subject  to  metabolism  by  P450  enzymes  or 
excreted intact by the kidneys. No metabolism studies and no studies in hepatic and renal impaired patients 
have been conducted.   
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) had no 
clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The effect of moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
> 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the 
pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown; however, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily 
cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is not expected to influence durvalumab exposure. 
No dose adjustment of durvalumab is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment as no difference in 
exposure is expected (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
(CrCL) 30 to 59 mL/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.The effect of severe 
renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 mL/min) on the PK of durvalumab is unknown. No dose adjustment of 
durvalumab is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Data from patients with 
severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC). 
Dosing of durvalumab is weight based, but no capping of dose has been suggested. The 97.5th percentile 
body weight was 111 kg, which is not representative of patients with extreme overweight or obesity. 
Individual simulation shows that dose adjustment may be necessary in these patients, and that the 8 mg/kg 
provide results are within the 90% range from the PopPK of the 10 mg/kg. However, the trial simulation 
show acceptable results, and it could be concluded that dose adjustment may not be necessary in obese 
patient. From a clinical perspective it is important that patients are not under-dosed. In case of over 
exposure in obese patients, there may be a higher risk of AEs. However, the treating physician can in such a 
case adjust the dose according to the guidance provided in the SmPC. Thus, it is endorsed that dose 
adjustment in obese patient is not necessary. 
No clinical relevant effect of ECOG status, high sPD-L1 level, race or albumin on PK parameters was 
identified. 
Patients tested positive for post-baseline ADAs had significant increased clearance, but as the prevalence was 
low, no obvious trend could be concluded in the Pop PK analyses. No safety issues are expected in patients 
and the reduction of PK exposure of less than 30% compared to a typical patient is not expected to be 
clinically relevant.

Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody and is not expected to induce or inhibit the major drug metabolizing 
cytochrome P450 pathways. The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting 
durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is 
not recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of 
durvalumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting 
durvalumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see Section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
In study 1108, target engagement was assessed through measurement of reduction in levels of free soluble 
PD-L1 (sPDL1) in serum as a peripheral pharmacodynamics marker.  No relationship between sPD-L1 
suppression and clinical response has been demonstrated and sPD-L1 is not a useful biomarker for clinical 
efficacy. An additional objective was to explore CD8+Ki67+ T cells as potential markers of the biological 
activity of PD-L1 blockade by durvalumab.  Biomarkers and translational research will be investigated further 
in durvalumab NSCLC development programmes.  
Exposure-efficacy relationship has been evaluated against AUCss, Cminss and Cmaxss. No trend was observed 
between Cmaxss and PFS and this endpoint was discarded. AUCss and Cminss were slightly correlated to PFS.  
A relevant change in exposure parameters (AUCss, Cmaxss and Cminss) was observed for several covariates: 
body weight, ADA, UC tumour type and albumin. A 30% threshold was established in order to consider 
clinical relevance, but those covariates influenced nearly 20% AUCss and Cminss values. Considering those 
parameters (AUCss and Cminss) were established as significant exposure endpoints during exposure-efficacy 
analysis, model predictions in extreme individuals would be necessary in order to assess how the lack of 
clinical relevance would affect PFS prolongation. 
No trend were observed between any exposure PK metric (AUCss, Cmaxss and Cminss) and the selected 
grade 3 and 4 adverse events.  
No thorough QTc study has been conducted, but an ECG study was conducted in cohort 2 of the ATLANTIC 
study. In the ATLANTIC study all patients were treated with the same durvalumab dose 10 mg/kg Q2W, and 
PK was measured in one post-dose sample and a few predose trough samples. PK-QT relationship was 
assessed based on the common visits that both ECG and PK were measured, ie. Week 0 predose, Week 0 end 
of infusion, Week 16 predose and Week 40 predose. The PK-QT analysis supports that no QT prolongation is 
seen for the proposed dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg Q2W.  
The proposed durvalumab monotherapy dose 10 mg/kg has been used in the clinical studies, but overall, 
uncertainties regarding the optimal dose have been identified. It is agreed that most patients will have an 
exposure that result in almost complete target saturation in serum, and it is also acknowledged that it is not 
feasible to show direct assessment of target saturation in tumour.  However, the applicant has provided 
reasonable evidence that the target is expected to be saturated with the 10 mg/kg. 
Durvalumab has a low immunogenic potential. The reduction in exposure observed in ADA positive patients is 
< 30 % and not expected to haveclinically relevant impact on efficacy. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab has overall been adequately described, but few issues remain to be 
addressed.  
No dose adjustments have been proposed to special populations, such as renal impaired, hepatic impaired, 
elderly and, extreme body weights according to the claimed clinical relevance threshold of 30%. Dose is

weight based with no capping.  
Durvalumab has a low immunogenic potential, but data are yet limited. Durvalumab clearance is increased in 
ADA positive patients. No safety issues are expected in patients with ADAs but lack of efficacy for the 
individual patient could be a risk.  
The pharmacodynamics of durvalumab is well understood. Durvalumab does not have ADCC or CDC activity 
due to the triple mutation in the Fc domain, and durvalumab is not expected to cause cytokine release.   
The applicant is recommended to further investigate biomarkers to identify patients likely to respond to 
durvalumab treatment. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response study was conducted.  
The recommended dosage of durvalumab is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 
minutes Q2W until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This dosing regimen is supported by a 
dataset from clinical and nonclinical trials. The key features are:  
• 
Tolerability: no dose-limiting toxicity were observed up to a durvalumab dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W or 20 
mg/kg Q4W (Study ID 302833, VMM0008, VMM0033: non clinical part) 
•  Achieves target exposure based on clinical PK/PD: durvalumab PK approached linearity at ≥3 mg/kg 
Q2W dose (trough concentration approximately 50 μg/mL), indicating complete target saturation. 
Population PK simulations indicated that following a durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen, >99% of 
the patients will reach the target trough concentration of ≥50 μg/mL to achieve complete target 
saturation. 
•  Achieves target exposure based on nonclinical efficacy models: durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W achieves 
a median trough concentration of >100 μg/mL (identified as a target concentration of durvalumab 
that yielded maximum tumor growth inhibition in mouse models).  
• 
The exposure-efficacy analysis based on PACIFIC indicated a longer PFS in durvalumab-treated 
patients (all exposure quartiles) compared to the placebo group. A slight trend suggesting longer PFS 
with higher durvalumab exposure at steady state is likely due to the PK being confounded by the 
slight decrease in durvalumab CL in patients benefitting from the treatment. 
•  No exposure-safety relationship was observed in the PACIFIC safety population following 10 mg/kg 
Q2W durvalumab. 
•  A 2.9% (45/1,570 patients) ADA incidence was observed following durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. There 
is no clear evidence that the presence of ADAs or nAbs has any potential impact on safety and 
population PK analysis showed that the presence of ADA had no clinically relevant effect on 
durvalumab PK.

Treatments 
Table 18: Details of study treatments 
The study treatment was to be discontinued prior to 12 months if there was confirmed progression of disease 
(PD), unacceptable toxicity, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent. Patients who 
achieved and maintained disease control (i.e., CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of the 12-month study 
treatment period could re-start treatment with the study drug upon evidence of disease progression during 
follow-up. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To assess the efficacy of Durvalumab treatment compared with placebo in terms of OS and PFS. 
Secondary objectives 
- 
To  further  assess  the efficacy  of  durvalumab  compared  with  placebo  in  terms  of:  OS24,  ORR,  DoR, 
APF12, APF18, and TTDM. 
- 
To  assess  symptoms  and  health-related  quality  of  life  in  patients  treated  with  MEDI4736  compared 
with placebo using EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 and LC13. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  pivotal  PACIFIC  study  has  2  primary  efficacy  endpoints:  progression  free  survival  (PFS)  and  overall 
survival (OS). 
Primary endpoints 
PFS  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  until  the  first  date  of  objective  progression  (using 
BICR assessments according to RECIST 1.1) or death. 
OS defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. 
Secondary endpoints 
-  Estimates of survival (24m) and PFS (12m and 24m) at different time points from randomisation. 
- 
TTDM  using  BICR  assessments  according  to  RECIST  1.1  –  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of 
randomization until the first date of distant metastasis or death in the absence of distant metastasis. 
-  ORR using BICR assessments according to RECIST 1.1– defined as the number (%) of patients with 
at least 1 visit response of CR or PR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 62/143 
 
 
-  DoR  using  BICR  assessments  according  to  RECIST  1.1  –  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  first 
documented  response  until  the  first  date  of  documented  progression  or  death  in  the  absence  of 
disease progression, whichever was earlier. 
- 
PFS2 as defined by local standard clinical practice 
-  EORTC QLQ-C30: Time to symptom deterioration (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, loss of 
appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea). Time to QoL/function deterioration (physical function, 
role function, emotional function, cognitive function, social function, and global health status/QoL). 
-  EORTC QLQ-LC13: Time to symptom deterioration (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and pain) Changes 
in WHO PS Scores were also to be assessed. 
PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue samples was assessed using a proprietary PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 
assay SP263; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. (Midha et al 2016). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
mutations were assessed using a central laboratory (QIAGEN Therascreen) for those patients who did not 
have local laboratory results. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements were collected in 
this study. 
Sample size 
Three interim analyses (one for PFS and two for OS) were planned. In total, the sample size was estimated to 
be approximately 702 patients to obtain 491 death events in the ITT population (70% maturity). The primary 
PFS analysis data cut-off will occur when it is expected that 458 PFS events have occurred (65% maturity). If 
the true PFS HR is 0.67, the study will provide 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
for PFS with a 2-sided significance level of 2.5% in the ITT population; this translates to a 5-month benefit in 
median PFS over 10 months on placebo if PFS is exponentially distributedThe smallest treatment difference 
that would be statistically significant is a HR of 0.80.  
The primary OS analysis data cut-off will occur when it is expected that 491 OS events have occurred (70% 
maturity). If the true OS HR is 0.73, this number of death events will provide at least 85% power to 
demonstrate a statistically significant difference for OS, assuming a 2.5% 2-sided significance level in the ITT 
population; this translates to an 8-month benefit in median OS over 22 months on placebo if OS is 
exponentially distributed. The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant is a HR of 
0.81.  
Randomisation 
Randomization is stratified by: age at randomisation (<65 vs ≥65 years of age), sex (male vs female), and 
smoking history (smoker vs non-smoker). Patients must not have progressed following definitive, platinum-
based, concurrent chemoradiation therapy; radiation therapy must be completed within 1 to 42 days prior to 
randomisation in the study (the last dose of radiation therapy is defined as the day of the last radiation 
treatment session). For patients who were recovering from toxicities associated with prior treatment, 
randomisation may be delayed by up to 42 days from the end of the chemoradiation therapy. 
The actual treatment given to patients was determined by the randomization scheme in the Interactive Voice 
Response System/Interactive Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). One randomization list was produced for 
each of the randomization strata, and all study centres used the same list in order to minimize any imbalance 
in the number of patients assigned to each treatment group. At Visit 2, patients who satisfied all entry criteria 
were randomized to either durvalumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.

Blinding (masking) 
This is a double-blinded study.  
Statistical methods 
The overall 5% type 1 error is split between the two primary endpoints OS and PFS. An alpha level of 2.5% is 
allocated to OS analysis and an alpha level of 2.5% is allocated to the PFS analysis. Several interim analyses 
were planned (see Figure xx below). The 2.5% alpha level allocated to PFS and to OS is controlled at the 
interim and primary time points by using the Lan DeMets (Lan and DeMets 1983) spending function. The 
family wise error rate (FWER) is controlled at 5% for PFS and OS according to Ye et al 2012. In this 
procedure, the testing will start from PFS, if the testing for PFS is significant at the alpha level specified in 
Figure xx at either interim or primary analysis the full 2.5% alpha level for PFS can be propagated to the 
testing of OS, which means that the OS will be tested at an overall alpha level of 5%. The alpha level for the 
interim analyses of OS will not be changed but the alpha level for the primary analysis of OS will be 
recalculated based on 5% alpha level overall with interim alpha levels as specified in Figure xx. OS24 and 
ORR will not be tested unless the null hypotheses for both PFS and OS are rejected. ORR will only be tested 
after the null hypothesis of PFS, OS, and OS24 are all rejected and ORR will be tested at a 5% level. The 
FWER for PFS, OS, and OS24 is also strongly controlled at 5% due to the fix-sequence testing nature and 
according to Glimm et al 2009. Finally, the FWER is still strongly controlled after adding the fix-sequence 
testing of ORR. So the FWER is strongly controlled at 5% for the testing of all four endpoints. In the 
presented analyses, the alpha level was derived based upon the exact number of PFS and OS events using 
the Lan and DeMets approach (PFS significance level = 1.1035 %; OS significance level =0.274%).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
Important amendments to the original study protocol, including when those amendments came into effect 
with respect to the recruitment of patients, and other significant changes to study conduct were introduced 
by means of 4 protocol amendments. Main changes are summarized below: 
•  Amendment 1 (10 June 2014):  
-  Addition of text to indicate study treatment should be discontinued if there is confirmed progression 
of disease following a previous response (PR or CR) to study treatment. 
•  Amendment 2 (8 August 2014): 
-  Addition of an interim analysis for PFS 
-  Added secondary objectives and outcome measures for time to relapse and time to death or distant 
metastasis 
•  Amendment 3 (18 February 2015): 
- 
The protocol was updated to allow patients who had completed radiation therapy from within 14 days 
from their last dose to within 42 days 
•  Amendment 4 (11 February 2016):  
-  Removal of time to relapse from study assessments. 
- 
“Investigator site” assessments revised to “BICR” assessments 
-  Additional OS interim analysis added to determine if the results show superiority in OS 
- 
The alpha allocation between PFS and OS has been changed to 2.5% and 2.5% from 0.5% and 4.5%, 
respectively, so that the statistical test can detect a smaller yet clinical meaningful treatment effect 
on PFS 
- 
The timing of PFS interim analysis was changed to a later time point when more PFS events have 
occurred 
- 
The Type I error was split between the 2 two primary endpoints, OS and PFS. The alpha level for OS 
and PFS was changed from 4.5% and 0.5%, respectively, to 2.5% equally. Additional adjustments 
were made with respect to this new approach in the multiple testing procedures for controlling the 
Type I error rate.

b Total RT dose was calculated through medical review of the prior RT case report for, data. 
c For the 2 patients in the missing row, the biological effective dose could not be calculated. This primarily occurred because we neither 
collected nor had access to their RT treatment planning data required to calculate a biological effective dose. One patient received a single 
8Gy fraction to gross disease followed by a course of conventionally fractioned external beam RT (receiving 52Gy in 26 fractions). 
Whereas the other patient received a pre-operative course of RT comprising 50.6Gy delivered in 23 fractions followed post-operatively by a 
total dose of 40Gy, delivered in 8 fractions, to the residual tumor. 
d Data entry error in the case report form. The data indicate the patient received neo-adjuvant (induction chemotherapy). 
Two patients also received high dose-rate brachytherapy before having gone on to receive a radical dose of conventionally fractionated 
external beam RT.

aTwo patients in the placebo group inadvertently received a single infusion of durvalumab therapy at Week 8 and Week 28, respectively, and 
thus were included in the safety analysis set for durvalumab. This deviation was discovered post-unblinding; the integrity of the blind 
remained intact. 
Full analysis set - all randomized patients analyzed on an ITT basis. 
Safety analysis set - all patients who received at least 1 dose of randomized study treatment, durvalumab or placebo. 
PK analysis set - all patients who receive at least 1 dose of durvalumab per the protocol, for whom any post-dose data are available and do 
not violate or deviate from the protocol in ways that would significantly affect the PK analyses. The 2 patients randomized to placebo group 
received 1 dose of durvalumab and were excluded from the PK analysis due to protocol violation.

Patients who have not progressed or died, or who progress or die after two or more missed visits, are censored at the latest non-
missing RECIST assessment, or day 1 if there are no non-missing visits. Patients who have no non-missing visits or do not have 
baseline data will be censored at study day 1 unless they die within 2 visits of baseline. 
Calculated using Kaplan-Meier technique. 
The analysis was performed using a stratified log rank test adjusting for age at randomisation (<65 vs ≥65), sex (Male vs Female) and 
smoking history (smoker vs non-smoker) with ties handled using the Breslow approach. 
The adjusted alpha levels for the treatment comparison was derived based upon the exact number of PFS events using the Lan and 
DeMets approach that approximates the O'Brien Fleming spending function.

Sensitivity analyses 
Analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the PFS effect to the potential source biases in PFS. 
An additional sensitivity analysis was performed using stratification factors as determined by the baseline CRF 
variables instead of the IVRS values in the stratified log-rank test. Two multivariate Cox regression models 
were used to adjust for the following prespecified covariates: 
•  Covariates for model 1: sex, age at randomization, and smoking history 
•  Covariates for model 2: sex, age at randomization, smoking history, stage of disease at study entry 
(Stage IIIA vs Stage IIIB), histology (squamous vs all other), best response to prior anticancer 
therapy (CR vs PR vs SD), WHO performance status (normal vs restricted activity), region (Asia vs 
Europe vs North America and South America), and race (White vs Black/African-American vs Asian vs 
Other). 
The results of these sensitivity analyses of PFS were consistent with those of the primary analyses. 
Another sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of alternative censoring rule of censoring patients at the last 
evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment (instead of the last RECIST 1.1 assessment) also showed consistent PFS 
effect (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.65) with the primary analysis where patients were censored at the last 
non-missing RECIST 1.1 assessment.

Subgroup analysis of progression free survival (PFS)  
The Forest Plot of PFS (BICR, RECIST 1.1) by pre-specified subgroups is presented in Figure 18. 
Hazard ratio (Durvalumab: Placebo) and 95% CI.  This is not calculated if the subgroup level has less than 20 events. 
The hazard ratio and 95% CI are estimated from an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the only cova riate and 
with the Efron method to control for ties. 
Progression includes deaths in the absence of RECIST progression. 
Patients who have not progressed or died, or who progress  or die  after two or  more  missed  visits,  are censored at the latest  non-missing 
RECIST assessment, or Day 1 if there are no non-missing visits.  Patients who have no non-missing visits or do not have baseline data will 
be censored at study Day 1 unless they die within 2 visits of baseline. 
Unknown is either insufficient tumour tissue, not able to be analysed or analysed but results were not interpretable.

Primary endpoint: OS 
The data included in this report is from the first planned interim OS analysis from the DCO date of 22 March 
2018. This analysis was planned after the occurrence of 285 deaths. At the time of this analysis, 299 deaths 
had occurred (61% of the final target 491 OS events). 
Treatment with durvalumab resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to placebo 
(Table 30 and Figure 19).

For both treatment groups, the ORRs based on Investigator assessments were consistent with those based on 
BICR assessments (32.3% for the durvalumab group and 19.7% for the placebo group; p-value less than 
0.001). The denominator included randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline as per BICR.

Duration of response seems to be longer in the durvalumab arm, but data are not yet mature. A formal 
comparison between the two treatment arms was not pre-planned, however, a post-hoc analysis for DOR 
shows a HR = 0.43 (95%CI: 0.22, 8.84).

Ancillary analyses 
- Outcomes in subgroups by PD-L1 expression: 
The Applicant conducted a retrospective analysis of PFS using a PD L1 TC 1% cut off.  The SP263 stained 
tumour samples were therefore re-scored after completing validation of the PD L1 TC1% cut off, and were 
read by pathologists trained and certified specifically at this cut-off.  Rescoring for the TC 1% cut off showed 
that of the 713 patients randomized, only 148 had TC expression <1% (90 in durvalumab group, 58 in the 
placebo group) and 303 had TC expression ≥1%.  As previously noted, for 262 patients, PD L1 expression 
was unknown. 
The results of this retrospective, exploratory analysis of PFS based on the PD L1 TC<1% and PD L1 TC≥1% 
cut offs, as well as PFS analysis in the PD-L1 unknown group, are summarized in Table 40.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) subclass that blocks 
the interaction of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) with its receptors programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) 
on T cells and cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 (B7.1) on immune cells. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has provided one pivotal study to support the claimed indication. The PACIFIC study is a 
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. The study design is acceptable in this patient population. 
The inclusion criteria clearly define the patient population as unresectable stage III NSCLC, who have 
received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy. The PACIFIC study 
enrolled patients regardless of their programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD L1) expression.  Tumour tissue 
collection was, not mandatory for inclusion, and testing was not conducted prospectively prior to 
randomization. However tumour PD L1 expression was tested retrospectively using, where available, tumour 
samples consisting of archival tissue obtained prior to chemoradiation with the VENTANA PD L1 (SP263) IHC 
assay. The study recruited all-comers with regard to PD-L1 expression, however, in the pre-defined subgroup 
analyses based on PD-L1 expression the applicant has applied a cut-off for PD-L1 expression at 25%. Patients

with prior exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody are excluded. This is has been reflected in the 
SmPC, section 5.1. 
The primary objectives of the study are clearly defined: to assess the efficacy of durvalumab compared with 
placebo in terms of PFS and OS. The Applicant has defined two primary endpoints; PFS by BICR and OS. Both 
endpoints are fully acceptable in this patient population. Several secondary endpoints are also defined; PFS2, 
OS24, ORR, DoR, AFP12 and AFP18 (proportion of patients alive and progression free at 12 months and 18 
months from randomisation), and TTDM (time to death or distant metastasis).   
Age is prognostic factor in this disease. Mean age at diagnosis has risen over the last decades from 60-65 to 
approximately 70-72 years in Caucasian patients. Most patients are above 65 years at the time of diagnosis 
(Postmus et al, 2017). However, patients in the study are younger, mean age is approximately 63 years.  
Furthermore, the majority of patients are ECOG/WHO PS 0 or 1. However, demographics and baseline 
characteristics are balanced and clearly reflected in the SmPC, section 5.1.   
During the course of the study, several anti PD-1/PD-L1 agents were approved for treatment of NSCLC and, 
as such, a number of requests were made for patients to be unblinded in order to determine the best option 
for the subsequent treatment.  A total of 86 patients were unblinded (47 in the durvalumab group and 39 in 
the placebo group).  It was determined that these unblinding had no effect on the PFS analysis, as they 
occurred after progression 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met both of its pre-specified endpoints, PFS by BICR and OS. Median PFS was improved by 11.2 
months in the durvalumab arm (16.8 vs 5.6 months in the durvalumab and placebo arm respectively). The 
HR is 0.52 (98.90%CI: 0.39, 0.70) , p<0.0001). This difference is statistically highly significant. 
It is noted the median PFS in the placebo considerable shorter than what is observed in the clinical setting 
(Butts et al. 2014). However, there are several important differences between the findings in the PACIFIC 
study and the Butts paper. Most importantly PFS was assessed by BICR in the PACIFIC study, while PFS by 
investigator in the PACIFIC study seems to be more in line with the finding in the Butts paper, where PFS was 
assessed by investigator.  
The Applicant presents OS interim data, which are 61% of the target number of final event. The results show 
an OS benefit in favour of durvalumab, the threshold for demonstrating superiority was crossed, and thus the 
Applicant considers the results as final. However, OS data are not fully mature yet, especially in the 
durvalumab arm. Thus, the Applicant is recommended to continue collecting OS data post-approval and 
provide yearly updates.  
The Applicant has also provided PFS2 data during the procedure. These results are in line with PFS and OS 
data, confirming the benefit of early treatment with durvalumab in the proposed patient population. Overall, 
the totality of evidence clearly shows that early treatment with durvalumab not only improves PFS, but also 
PFS2 and OS. The results are considered clinically relevant in a patient population with high risk of relapse 
and a dismal prognosis.  
The study is critically weakened by the fact that the Applicant did not stratify per PD-L1 expression. This may 
seem illogical considering the mode of action of the drug, i.e. selective blocking of the interaction of PD-L1 
with PD-1 and CD80. The applicant was asked to provide evidence that efficacy was maintained for all 
patients irrespective of their expression of PD-L1 to provide subgroup analyses in patients with <1% and  ≥ 
1%, of tumour cells expressing PD-L1 (as well as other PD-L1 cut-off). 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 97/143 
 
The Applicant presented a retrospective analysis of PFS by PD-L1 1% cut-off. This was done by BICR. In 
total, information on PD-L1 expression was available for 451 patients (63%). Of these, 148 patients had PD-
L1 expression below 1%, and 303 patients had an expression over 1%. The results show that durvalumab is 
effective regardless of PD-L1 expression in terms of PFS, however, the size of the effect is considerable lower 
in patients with PD-L1 <1% (10.7 vs 5.6 months). Furthermore, OS data were provided during the procedure 
and do not show benefit of durvalumab in patients with PD-L1 <1%. Thus, it was concluded that efficacy had 
not been clearly established across all patients irrespective of their expression of PD-L1. In patients with PD-
L1 expression below 1% efficacy could not be unequivocally established which is also supported by the 
mechanism of action of durvalumab.  
The applicant provided efficacy data in various subgroups: 
Smoking status:  patients who never smoked derived a PFS benefit (HR: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.15, 0.57]) along 
with smokers (HR: 0.59 [0.47, 0.73]). 
EGFR mutations:  A PFS benefit was observed in the EGFR wild type subgroup (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.36, 
0.60).  Additionally, the observed treatment effect was also in favour of durvalumab in the EGFR mutant 
subgroup (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.35, 1.64).  However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to 
the small number of patients who were EGFR mutant (29 in the durvalumab group and 14 in placebo) and 
the small number of events (17 in the durvalumab group and 11 in the placebo group). 
Histology: Although the trial was not specifically designed to answer the question whether there could be 
relevant differences in efficacy across subgroups of NSCLC histology (squamous vs. non squamous), results 
in these subgroups in terms of PFS (squamous (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.92) vs. other (HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 
0.33, 0.59) did not appear to show any clinically relevant difference according to histology. Additional data on 
subgroups according to histology remains consistent with results on PFS.  
Age: There seems to be greater effect in younger patients (<65 years) compared to older patients (>=65 
years). 
The number of ADA positive patients is very limited (19 patients in the durvalumab arm vs. 10 patients in the 
placebo arm), and thus formal efficacy analyses for PFS and OS was not conducted. The applicant is 
recommended to further investigate efficacy in ADA positive patients post-authorisation. 
Patient-reported symptoms, function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were collected using the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The LC13 and C30 were assessed at 
baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks until completion of the treatment 
period or discontinuation of durvalumab due to toxicity or disease progression. Compliance was similar 
between the Imfinzi and placebo treatment groups (83% vs 85.1% overall of evaluable forms completed). 
At baseline, no differences in patient reported symptoms, function and HRQoL were observed between 
durvalumab and placebo groups. Throughout the duration of the study to Week 48, there was no clinically 
meaningful difference between durvalumab and placebo groups in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL (as 
assessed by a difference of greater than or equal to 10 points).  
The applicant had planned several exploratory analyses. However, none of these were submitted in this 
application. It is recommended that the Applicant submits these analyses together with the final analysis 
(CSR) post-approval.  
The Applicant provides two supportive studies. Overall, it is seen that efficacy is considerably smaller in the 
subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression <25% compared to the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 98/143 
 
expression ≥ 25%. The results should be interpreted with caution. These studies are conducted in a different 
patient population, non-comparative and with different primary endpoints. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the study met both of its primary endpoints. However, the study included all-comers, but the 
Applicant did not systematically collect data on different levels of PD-L1 expression. Considering the mode of 
action (i.e. the blocking of the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1/CD80 receptors) the Applicant was asked 
to provide evidence of efficacy across all patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Efficacy in patients with 
PD-L1 expression below 1% could not be unequivocally established. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
An overview of durvalumab clinical studies that provide the safety and tolerability data in this application is 
presented in Table xx. The Pivotal Safety Analysis Set that provides evidence supporting the safety and 
tolerability claims in the proposed indication is based on the interim analysis of the ongoing pivotal 
D4191C00001 study (PACIFIC). This dataset includes 475 patients who received at least 1 infusion of 
durvalumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W and 234 patients who received at least 1 infusion of placebo. A supportive 
assessment of the safety and tolerability is provided in the Supportive Safety Dataset (the Monotherapy Pool) 
that includes patients across the clinical program who received durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. The Monotherapy 
Pool (1889 patients) includes data from 3 sponsored studies that have achieved a predefined interim data 
cut-off (DCO) date: 475 patients from the PACIFIC study, 444 patients from the ATLANTIC study, and 970 
patients from Study 1108 (which enrolled patients with advanced solid tumours, including NSCLC). Patients 
with NSCLC were enrolled in all 3 studies, but the disease stage and prior therapy differed substantially 
across the 3 studies.

Immunogenicity 
Of the 1570 patients who were treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the 
presence of ADAs, 2.9% (45/1570) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising 
antibodies (nAbs) against durvalumab were detected in 0.5% (8/1570) of patients. 
Data from the PACIFIC trial are described below.

No patients with positive ADA status experienced infusion-related reactions. Three patients treated with 
durvalumab were nAb-positive and did not report AEs suggestive of an infusion reaction or hypersensitivity 
type reaction. The types of AEs reported in ADA-positive patients were similar to those reported in patients 
who were ADA-negative (Data not shown). 
Local tolerance 
In the combined safety database with durvalumab monotherapy, infusion related reactions occurred in 35 
(1.9%) patients, including Grade 3 in 5 (0.3%) patients.

Comparison of adverse events between the durvalumab group in PACIFIC and the Monotherapy 
Pool 
The patient population in PACIFIC differed from that in the Monotherapy Pool in that PACIFIC included 
patients who had undergone chemoradiation within 6 weeks of enrolling in the study and the pooled dataset 
included patients who had advanced late-stage disease and had received multiple prior lines of therapy. Aside 
from these (per-protocol) differences, the demographic and baseline characteristics of the durvalumab-
treated patients were similar, although the Monotherapy Pool included fewer male patients, fewer patients 
located in Europe, and fewer current smokers. 
The treatment duration for patients in the Monotherapy Pool was shorter (17.9 week) than for patients in the 
durvalumab group in PACIFIC (44.0 weeks), which is likely reflective of the patient population included in the 
pooled data.  
With the exception of the events of pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary infection events 
(which were higher in both treatment groups of PACIFIC than in the Monotherapy Pool), the type, incidence 
and severity of AEs reported in the Monotherapy Pool were generally similar to those reported in the 
durvalumab group of PACIFIC, with no new or unexpected safety findings identified within this larger pooled 
dataset. 
There was a higher incidence in the Monotherapy Pool of Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs (43.9% vs 32.0% in the 
durvalumab group of PACIFIC) and SAEs (37.2% vs 28.6% in the durvalumab group of PACIFIC), which may 
be accounted for by the differences in patient population in the 2 datasets. The exposure-adjusted rate for 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 events per 100 patient-years was 94.0 in the Monotherapy Pool and 47.5 in the PACIFIC 
durvalumab group. 
The higher rate of discontinuation due to AEs in the durvalumab group of PACIFIC (15.4% vs 9.4% in the 
Monotherapy Pool) is largely due to the higher incidence of pneumonitis, which resulted in discontinuation of 
study treatment for 4.8% of patients in the durvalumab group of PACIFIC and 1.5% of patients in the 
Monotherapy Pool; the rate of discontinuation in the PACIFIC placebo group was 2.6%. 
Excluding patients with infusion-related/hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, AESIs were reported for 
1048 patients (55.5%) in the Monotherapy Pool, which was lower than the 65.5% reported for the 
durvalumab group of PACIFIC. The corresponding exposure-adjusted rate was 98.2 AESIs per 100 patient-
years for the durvalumab group, as compared to 82.1 per 100 patient-years for the placebo group. 
Given that all except 1 of the patients with radiation pneumonitis were from PACIFIC, an additional analysis 
was conducted comparing the durvalumab group in PACIFIC and a pooled dataset that included only 
ATLANTIC and Study 1108. Within this smaller pool, the incidence of AESIs of pneumonitis was 2.3% and the 
incidence of imAEs of pneumonitis was 2.0%, which confirms that the incidence of this event is driven by its 
occurrence in PACIFIC, in patients with recent chemoradiation.  
Among the other AESIs, the results from the Monotherapy Pool were largely consistent with those from the 
durvalumab group in PACIFIC. For example,  
•  Dermatitis/rash:  
AESIs, 25.8% Monotherapy Pool and 32.6% durvalumab in PACIFIC; 
•  Diarrhea/colitis: 
AESIs, 17.8% Monotherapy Pool and 18.9% durvalumab in PACIFIC; 
•  Hyperthyroidism:

Post marketing experience 
The Applicant has provided the data of the 3rd quarterly Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Report (PADER) 
for Imfinzi (durvalumab), covering the reporting period from 01 November 2017 to 31 January 2018. The 
data are summarized below: 
There were 297 reports that met the criteria for inclusion in this periodic report. Of the 297 reports (179 
initial, 118 follow-up), 280 met criteria for expedited reporting and 17 were classified as non-expedited. Of 
the 280 expedited reports (regardless of the causality), there were 5 reports of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI), 2 reports of encephalopathy, 1 report of autoimmune, encephalitis, and 1 report of encephalomyelitis.  
Determination of causality is difficult in these reports. The applicant did not identify any new risk that would 
change the benefit/risk profile of durvalumab. There were 52 reports with event(s) that had a fatal outcome : 
7 indicated sudden death, 5 fatal outcome (diarrhea, hepatitis, pneumonitis/respiratory failure, hemorrhagic 
colitis, and pneumonitis/hepatitis), 9 were not causally related to durvalumab, 11 involved an infection, 3 had 
alternative causes, 3 had substantial confounding explanations/confounders, 6 had disease progression 
and/or underlying disease that contributed to the fatal outcomes, 2 reports of interstitial lung disease, 2 
additional reports involving possible immune-mediated events and the remaining 4 reports contained limited 
information for causal assessment. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The pivotal safety analysis set from the PACIFIC study included patients in the relevant treatment setting for 
the proposed indication, i.e. post-chemoradiation. Of 709 patients, 475 patients received durvalumab, and 
234 patients received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 44 weeks in the durvalumab arm. The 
Applicant has provided updated safety data (from the 90-DSU), with approximately 5 months of additional 
follow-up (new data cut-off date: 31/07/2017) and an additional 3.5 patient years of exposure to durvalumab 
treatment. Nearly all patients had completed the 12 mths of tx at the 13 Feb DCO – a large portion of 
patients continue in the study for follow up for progression and survival. During these additional 5 months, 
20 patients were re-treated (12 and 8 patients, respectively in the durvalumab and placebo groups, 
respectively). Almost all of them were ongoing retreatment at the DCO of the 90-DSU (one patient in the 
durvalumab group completed 12 months of re-treatment). The safety profile of durvalumab is clinically 
manageable with no major safety concerns. No new safety findings were observed during the additional 
follow-up. 
Almost every patient in the pivotal study experienced at least one AE. Treatment-related AEs were reported 
more frequent in durvalumab-treated patients (67.8% vs. 53.4% for placebo, respectively). The proportion of 
placebo-treated patients with treatment-related AEs seems surprisingly high. It needs to be noted that 
patients were randomized into the PACIFIC study after 1 to 42 days (initially) or 14-42days (after study 
amendment#3) from the end of the previous therapy. The Applicant presented AEs data occurring in the 
following time points from the start of treatment: 0-3 months, 3-6 months and > 6 months (data not 
shown). Overall, no major concerns have been identified. The majority of events were reported within 3 
months from the start of treatment. The main differences in frequency between both treatment groups can 
be mostly accounted for risks already described for durvalumab and other PD-L1 inhibitors (e.g., immune-
mediated events, infections). 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 127/143 
 
 
In the PACIFIC study, the most frequent adverse reactions were cough (40.2% vs 30.3% in placebo), upper 
respiratory tract infections (26.1% vs 11.5% in placebo) and rash (21.7% vs 12.0% in placebo). The most 
frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reaction was pneumonia (6.5% vs 5.6% in placebo). The overall incidence of 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 12.8% in the durvalumab arm vs 9.8% in placebo. 
Immune-mediated Pneumonitis 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic 
corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab.  
Radiation pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and the 
clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the PACIFIC Study, in 
patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation within 1 to 42 
days prior to initiation of the trial, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 161 (33.9%) patients in 
the durvalumab-treated group and 58 (24.8%) in the placebo group, including Grade 3 (3.4% vs 3.0%) and 
Grade 5 (1.1% vs 1.7%).  
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis. Patients with 
suspected pneumonitis should be evaluated with radiographic imaging.  
Immune-mediated hepatitis 
Immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate 
aetiology, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for 
abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment with durvalumab, and as indicated based on 
clinical evaluation. 
Immune-mediated colitis 
Immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear 
alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of colitis or diarrhoea. 
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies 
Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism 
Immune-mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) occurred in patients receiving 
durvalumab, and hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism. Patients should be monitored for abnormal 
thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. 
Adrenal insufficiency 
Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving durvalumab. Patients should be 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in patients receiving durvalumab. Patients should be 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

EMA/548232/2018 
Page 128/143 
 
 
 
Hypophysitis/hypopituitarism 
Immune-mediated hypophysitis or hypopituitarism occurred in patients receiving durvalumab. Patients should 
be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For symptomatic 
hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. 
Immune-mediated nephritis 
Immune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate 
aetiology, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for abnormal renal 
function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with durvalumab. 
Immune-mediated rash 
Immune-mediated rash or dermatitis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear 
alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab. Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic 
epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or dermatitis. 
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Given the mechanism of action of durvalumab, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions may 
occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients treated with 
durvalumab monotherapy in clinical trials (n = 1889): myocarditis, myositis, polymyositis. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms. Events of pancreatitis have been reported in patients in the clinical study 
programme. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms. 
Infusion related reactions 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion related reactions. Severe infusion related 
reactions have been reported in patients receiving durvalumab (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Overall, 15.4% vs 9.8% of the patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. The most common AEs leading to 
discontinuations were pneumonia, pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis, which is considered expectable 
and acceptable in this setting. The rate drops, however, if only treatment-related events are included (9.9% 
vs 3.4%). Overall, 35 patients died due to any AE, but treatment-related deaths were rare and balanced 
between the treatment arms.  
Some  decreases  in  baseline  creatinine  clearance  were  observed  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  shifts  in 
creatinine  clearance  from  baseline  to  a  worse  renal  impairment  seemed  reversible  and  transient  in  the 
majority of the patients in both groups (durvalumab and placebo). 
Hypertension and hypotension were more common in the durvalumab arm. The data submitted on ECG 
abnormalities are currently of no concern (data not shown), and durvalumab is not at this point in time 
considered cardiotoxic.  
No overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. Data from 
NSCLC patients 75 years of age or older are limited. 
Patients were enrolled in the pivotal study regardless of their PD-L1 expression. However, the type, 
incidence, and severity of AEs were comparable across PD-L1 status in both treatment arms.  Overall, there 
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 129/143 
 
 
was no observable pattern that would suggest a different safety profile of durvalumab based on PD L1 status 
(approximately 39% had PD-L1 <25%, 24.2% had PD-L1 > 25 and 36 % had an unknown status).  
The Applicant presented data that show ADA prevalence of approximately 4.5-5% in both treatment arms. 
There seems to be no difference between ADA positive and negative patients in terms of safety, but data are 
too limited to draw any firm conclusions. 
Regarding safety, although some AEs categories were numerically higher in the subset of patients with 
squamous histology (Any AEs related to treatment, Any SAEs) the same trend is observed in the placebo 
group. 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with durvalumab and for 
at least 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab. There are no data on the use of durvalumab in pregnant 
women. Based on its mechanism of action and non-clinical data available, durvalumab has the potential to 
impact maintenance of pregnancy. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and placental transfer 
of durvalumab was confirmed in animal studies. Durvalumab may cause foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman and is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. 
It is unknown whether durvalumab is secreted in human breast milk. In humans, antibodies may be 
transferred to breast milk, but the potential for absorption and harm to the newborn is unknown. However, a 
potential risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast feeding or to discontinue or abstain from durvalumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast 
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
There are no data on the potential effects of durvalumab on fertility in humans or animals (see section 4.6 of 
the SmPC).  
At the time of this assessment, durvalumab has been on the market in the US for over 6 months. The 
Applicant has provided the data of the 3rd quarterly Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Report (PADER) for 
durvalumab, covering the reporting period from 01 November 2017 to 31 January 2018. The adverse events 
reported during this reporting period seem to be consistent with the safety profile of durvalumab assessed in 
this application. No new signals have been identified. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of durvalumab was as expected for PDL1-inhibitors. Cough, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, 
diarrhea and lung infections were observed. Most of the toxicity was clinically manageable and treatment-
related deaths were rare. The discontinuation rate was 15.4% in the durvalumab arm, which is considered 
acceptable in this patient population. 
Overall, the safety profile of durvalumab seems acceptable and in line with other PD-L1-inhibitors.

Routine risk minimisations measures are considered sufficient to minimise the safety concerns of Imfinzi. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 01 May 2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that durvalumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers durvalumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Imfinzi (durvalumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.>

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The following indication is applied for: 
Durvalumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Locally advanced disease (Stage IIIA and IIIB) comprises approximately 30% of the NSCLC diagnoses. 
Approximately, one-third of the patients with Stage IIIA disease are considered operable. However, the 
majority of patients with Stage IIIA/B have inoperable (unresectable) disease, and are amenable to receiving 
curative intention chemoradiation treatment. The biological characteristics of locally advanced, Stage III 
disease are poorly defined; the clinical characteristics associated with prognosis are nodal station 
involvement, size of primary tumour, baseline pulmonary function, gender, presence or absence of significant 
weight loss, and performance status (PS). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no established treatments for patients that have completed curative intent chemoradiotherapy.  
The majority of these patients will eventually relapse. It is seen that patients relapse relatively fast, and 
approximately 65% relapse within 12 months in the placebo arm. This is in line with the clinical reality 
(Goldstraw et al., 2016). Thus, there is an unmet medical need, which durvalumab attempts to fulfil. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Applicant has provided one pivotal study (PACIFIC) to support the claimed indication. The PACIFIC study 
is a double-blind, randomised, place-controlled study. The study design is acceptable in this patient 
population. The inclusion criteria clearly define the patient population as unresectable stage III NSCLC, who 
have received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met both of its pre-specified endpoints, PFS by BICR and OS. Median PFS was improved by 11.2 
months in the durvalumab arm (16.8 vs 5.6 months in the durvalumab and placebo arm respectively). The 
HR is 0.52 (98.90%CI:0.39, 0.70) , p<0.0001). This difference is statistically highly significant.  The 
Applicant presents OS interim data, which are 61% of the target number of final event. The results show an 
OS benefit in favour of durvalumab, the threshold for demonstrating superiority was crossed, and thus the 
Applicant considers the results as final. However, OS data are not fully mature yet, especially in the 
durvalumab arm.  
The Applicant has also provided PFS2 data as requested. These results are in line the PFS and OS data, 
confirming the benefit of early treatment with durvalumab in the proposed patient population. Overall, the 
totality of evidence clearly shows that early treatment with durvalumab not only improves PFS, but also PFS2 
and OS. The results are considered clinically relevant in a patient population with high risk of relapse and a 
dismal prognosis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/548232/2018 
Page 138/143 
 
Secondary endpoints included to provide additional evidence of clinical benefit all showed consistency with 
the PFS results. An ORR 28.4% (95% CI 24.28, 32.89) vs 16% (95% CI 11.31, 21.59) was observed in 
durvalumab and placebo arms respectively (p<0.001). Median DoR was not reached in the durvalumab arm 
and it was 13.8 months in the placebo group.  
A median TTDM time of 23.2 months (95%CI 23.2, NR) was observed for durvalumab vs. 14.6 months 
(95%CI 10.6, 18.6) (Δ 8.6 months). Updated results continue to favour durvalumab. 
Time to first subsequent therapy, which indirectly could reflect the quality of life of patients, was longer in the 
durvalumab arm (19.1 months; 95%CI: 16.6, NR) than in placebo arm (11.3 months; 95%CI: 9.0, 15.8) (HR 
0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.78; p<0.0001). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study recruited all-comers, and the subgroup analyses showed efficacy in patients with PD-L1 expression 
>= 25%, PD-L1 expression < 25% and PD-L1 expression “unknown”. However, as discussed above, it is not 
entirely clear how and why the cut-off is at 25%. The Applicant has been asked to provide subgroup analyses 
in patients with <1%, >= 1%, 5% and 50%, and compare and discuss these results with the results based 
the on the 25% cut-off. The Applicant provided a retrospective analysis of PFS by PD-L1 1% cut-off. This was 
done by BICR. In total, information on PD-L1 expression was available for 451 patients (63%). Of these, 148 
patients had PD-L1 expression below 1%, and 303 patients had an expression over 1%. The results show 
that durvalumab is effective regardless of PD-L1 expression in terms of PFS, however, the size of the effect is 
considerably lower in the PD-L1 negative patients (10.7 vs 5.6 months).  
Looking at the OS data (provided after the formal responses), there is an uncertainty about the benefit of 
durvalumab in patients with PD-L1 <1%. Many of the patients in the placebo arm received immunotherapy 
post progression, which could have influenced the outcome, the extent of which cannot be determined. Data 
indicate that patients with PD-L1 <1% could be better off by treatment with immunotherapy at progression 
compared to early use in the switch maintenance setting. The Applicant argued that there is in imbalance in 
squamous vs. non-squamous histology that could bias the results. However, retrospective multivariate 
analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the two histologies. Other imbalances are also 
mentioned, and there seems to inconsistencies between ORR, PFS and OS. The limitations in the 
interpretation of post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis are acknowledged, however the pattern of the 
curves of PFS and OS according to PD-L1 expression suggest a correlation between PD-L1 expression and 
benefit. The Applicant has not convincingly demonstrated that the use of durvalumab in patients with PD-L1 
<1% is justified. The study is critically weakened by the fact that the applicant did not stratify per PD-L1 
expression. This may seem illogical considering that an anti-PD-L1 was being investigated in the PACIFIC 
study. Moreover, durvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that 
selectively blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). It is therefore considered reasonable 
that PD-L1 expression could play an important role in the efficacy of this medicinal product, reinforcing the 
rationale for a benefit driven by PD-L1 ≥1% patients. 
The lack of data beyond 12-months of treatment precludes from concluding about B/R with different 
treatment duration. Treatment duration should be limited to pivotal clinical trial conditions. The Applicant has 
revised section 4.2 accordingly.  
The Applicant has provided a post-hoc analysis, which shows that there seems to be no difference between 
the treatment groups with regards to patients, who were treated through progression. This is now reflected in 
the SmPC.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients in both treatment groups experienced AEs (96.8% vs. 94.9%, for durvalumab and 
placebo,  respectively).  Treatment-related  AEs  were  reported  more  frequent  in  durvalumab-treated  patients 
(67.8% vs. 53.4% for placebo, respectively). 
The most common AEs were: cough (35.4% and 25.2% for durvalumab and placebo, respectively), pyrexia 
(14.7% and 9.0%), pneumonia (13.1% and 7.7%), pruritus (12.2% and 4.7%), hypothyroidism (11.6% and 
1.7%), and hyperthyroidism (7.4% and 1.7%). 
Grade 3-4 events were 32.0% and 27.8%, for durvalumab and placebo respectively. The proportion of 
patients who experienced SAEs was 28.6% and 22.6%, for durvalumab and placebo, respectively.  SAEs 
were more frequently reported in the respiratory, thoracic disorder SOC for both groups.  
A total of 311 patients (65.5%) in the durvalumab group and 114 patients (48.7%) in the placebo group 
experienced an AESI during the study. The most frequently reported AESIs were the combined term of 
pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (33.9% in the durvalumab group and 24.8% in the placebo group), the 
combined term of dermatitis/rash (32.6% vs. 17.9%), the combined term of diarrhea/colitis (18.9% vs 
19.7%), hypothyroidism (13.3% vs. 3.0%), and hyperthyroidism (10.1% vs. 3.0%). 
A total of 15.4% of patients receiving durvalumab and 9.8% receiving placebo had AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study medication. The most frequent AE leading to treatment discontinuation were 
respiratory/thoracic disorders (6.3% and 3.0%, for durvalumab and placebo, respectively), followed by 
infection (2.3% and 2.6, for durvalumab and placebo, respectively). 
Overall, the safety profile of durvalumab seems acceptable and in line with other PDL1-inhibitors.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite the recent advances in the treatment of NSCLC the prognosis of patients with unresectable locally 
advance disease is still poor with survival rates still disappointing. Outcomes from PACIFIC trial show 
statistically significant results in terms PFS supported by OS data.   
The safety profile of durvalumab can be considered as expected with immune check-point inhibitors. 
Immune-related AEs occur more frequently in the durvalumab arm. Of most concern is pneumonitis. 
However, the majority of the AEs are clinically manageable.  
All in all, treatment with durvalumab offers a valuable option for patients with unresectable locally advanced 
NSCLC, in delaying the progression disease and prolonging survival.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The gain in PFS and OS is considered clinically meaningful. This represents a valuable option for patients in 
the locally advanced setting of NSCLC. However, due to the uncertainties identified in patients whose 
tumours express PD-L1 <1%, it is not possible to determine the benefit/risk balance in that patient 
population, which has therefore been excluded from the authorised indication. Such restriction is also 
supported by the mechanism of action of Imfinzi. 
The safety profile seems manageable and acceptable, which is considered important in a population where 
there is not an actual treatment.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imfinzi is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Imfinzi is favourable in the following indication: 
“Imfinzi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable non small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not 
progressed following platinum based chemoradiation therapy (see section 5.1)” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

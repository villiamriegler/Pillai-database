are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Sofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with ledipasvir was

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC (Epclusa, Harvoni, Sovaldi) and 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.2 (Vosevi) in order to add new information 
regarding the use of the sofosbuvir-containing 
products in patients with renal impairment, based on 
final results from studies GS-US-342-4062, GS-US-
337-4063 and GS-US-334-0154, listed as a category 
3 study in the RMP and study GS-US-338-1125. 
Study GS-US-342-4062 was a phase 2, multi-centre, 
open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 Weeks in subjects 
with chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis for 
administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 
chronic hepatitis C and severe renal impairment in an 
open-label study (Study 0154). The safety of sofosbuvir in 
a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or 
velpatasvir has been studied in 154 patients with ESRD 
requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this 
setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 
20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse 
reactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this 
limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events 
and deaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected 
in ESRD patients. 
The CHMP considered that safety data on the use of the 
sofosbuvir-based products in patients with severe renal 
impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 
Page 9/20

concluded that the sofosbuvir-based products can be used 
in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other 
relevant treatment options are available.

Study GS-US-337-4063 was a phase 2, multi-centre, 
open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in subjects with genotype 1, 
4, 5 and 6 chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis 
for end stage renal disease.  
Study GS-US-334-0154 was a phase 2b, open label 
study of 200 mg or 400 mg Sofosbuvir+ribavirin for 
24 Weeks in Genotype 1 or 3 HCV infected subjects 
with renal insufficiency.  
Study GS-US-338-1125 was a phase 1, open-label,

pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir in subjects with 
normal renal function and severe renal impairment.

(sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) and atorvastatin and earlier 
experience with co-administration of Vosevi 
(sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir) and other statins, the 
CHMP concluded that atorvastatin may be administered 
with Vosevi at a dose that does not exceed atorvastatin 20 
mg. 
Update of sections 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add 
new information regarding co-administration with 
atorvastatin, based on final results from study GS-
US-342-4034. 
Study GS-US-342-4034 was a phase 1 study to

atorvastatin.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order

final results from study GS-US-334-2130. This was a 
phase I study to evaluate the effects of cytochrome 
rifabutin and carbamazepine administration on the drug 
levels of sofosbuvir have been updated throughout the 
Product Information.  
With regards to the rifabutin interaction, a 28% reduction 
in sofosbuvir exposure was observed. Considering that 
reduction in sofosbuvir dose of <50% is expected to be 
safe in terms of potentially reduced efficacy, the CHMP 
concluded that the data support removal of co-

and probe drug pharmacokinetics in healthy 
subjects.  Furthermore, section 4.3 of the Sovaldi 
SmPC was updated in order to remove the use of 
rifabutin as a contraindication. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the

administration of rifabutin as contraindication from the 
Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) Product Information. The 
contraindication is maintained for Epclusa, Harvoni and 
Vosevi, given the lack of data on interactions with the other 
active substances contained in these combination products. 
The data available for interactions with carbamazepine 
indicated that sofosbuvir levels were reduced by 48%, but 
the confidence interval included the 50% value. Therefore, 
the CHMP considered that a cautionary approach should be 
taken and contraindication concerning co-administration of 
carbamazepine should be retained. 
Furthermore, the term “potent P-glycoprotein inducers” 
was replaced by “strong P-glycoprotein inducers” 
throughout the Product Information in line with terminology 
used in the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug 
interactions.

previously treated with a sofosbuvir/velpatasvir-containing 
regimen. The median time to re-treatment was 414 days. 
Of the 31 patients enrolled, 74% were male, 81% were 
white, 71% had a baseline body mass index < 30 kg/m2, 
48% had compensated cirrhosis, 58% had previously 
received sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, and 42% 
had previously received sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Most 
subjects had genotype 1 (61%), 1a (48%), 1b 13% or 
genotype 3 (26%) HCV infection. The overall sustained 
virologic response rate at 12 weeks was 100%.

Velpatasvir was not carcinogenic in the 2-year rat 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC based on data 
from a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study TX-281-
2030. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
update the ATC code in line with the new 
classification of antivirals for treatment of HCV 
carcinogenicity study at exposures at least 5-times higher 
than human exposure.

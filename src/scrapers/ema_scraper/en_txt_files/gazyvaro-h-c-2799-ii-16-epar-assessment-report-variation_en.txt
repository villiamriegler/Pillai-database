2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The benefit of adding rituximab to combination chemotherapy during the initial treatment of advanced 
NHL has been documented in multiple clinical trials over the past decade.  
Efficacy and safety results of the pivotal, randomized, open-label, Phase III study BO21223 (GALLIUM) 
in  patients  with  previously  untreated  advanced  indolent  non  –Hodgkin  lymphoma  NHL  compare 
obinutuzumab to established treatment with rituximab.  
2.1.2.  Disease or condition 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) includes all types of malignant lymphomas except from Hodgkin's 
disease. These include a heterogeneous group of malignancies, ranging from slow-growing iNHL, which 
comprise about a third of all NHLs, to more aggressive forms of NHL. The main subtypes of iNHL are 
follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphomas, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Follicular 
lymphomas are indolent (slow-growing) NHL and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas overall. 
2.1.3.  Epidemiology , Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Follicular  lymphomas  (FLs)  are  the  second  most  frequent  subtype  of  nodal  lymphoid  malignancies  in 
Western  Europe.  The  annual  incidence  of  this  disease  in  the  EU  has  rapidly  increased  during  recent 
decades  and  has  risen  from  2–3/100  000  during  the  1950s  to  5/100  000  recently  [1],  representing 
approximately  22%  of  all  NHLs  and  70%  of  indolent  NHL.  Marginal  zone  lymphomas  account  for 
approximately 5-10% of NHL cases. 
2.1.4.  Biologic features and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
NHL is distinguished from Hodgkin's disease only by the absence of binucleate giant cells. Follicular 
lymphomas are indolent (slow-growing) NHL and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas overall, defined as a lymphoma of follicle center B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts), 
which has at least a partially follicular pattern. It is positive for the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD22, 
and usually CD20, but almost always negative for CD5.  
Follicular  lymphoma  is  defined  as  a  mature  B-cell  neoplasm  in  the  2008  World  Health  Organization 
(WHO)  classification  of  tumors  of  hematopoietic  and  lymphoid  tissues.  Follicular  lymphoma  cells  are 
malignant counterparts of normal germinal center B cells. Approximately 85% of patients with FL have 
a  genomic  translocation  t(14;18)(q32;q21),  [2]  which  results  in  the  overexpression  of  the  BCL-2 
protein, a member of a family of proteins that blocks programmed cell death or apoptosis. 
2.1.5.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Diagnosis should be based on a surgical specimen/excisional lymph node biopsy and in the cases 
without easily accessible lymph nodes core biopsies can be carried. Fine needle aspirations are 
inappropriate for a reliable diagnosis. The histological report should give the diagnosis according to the 
World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Grading of lymph node biopsies is carried out 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 7/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
according to the number of blasts/high-power field (Table 1). FL grade 3B (with sheets of blasts) is 
considered an aggressive lymphoma and treated as such, whereas grade 1, 2 and 3A should be treated 
as indolent disease [3]. Review, especially of grade 3A or 3B, by an expert haematopathologist is 
performed if the infiltration pattern is atypical (diffuse areas, even with small cells). 
Since treatment largely depends on the stage of the disease, initial staging should be thorough, 
particularly in the small proportion of patients with early stages I and II (10%–15%) including a 
computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis, and a bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy; Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT is particularly important to confirm 
localised stage I/II before involved-field radiotherapy. 
A complete blood count, routine blood chemistry including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), β2 
microglobulin and uric acid as well as screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C are required. The staging is carried out according to the Ann 
Arbor classification system with mention of bulky disease (>7 cm) when appropriate. 
For prognostic purposes, a ‘Follicular Lymphoma-specific International Prognostic Index’ (FLIPI, see 
Table 1) has been established [4]. A revised FLIPI 2 (incorporating β2 microglobulin, diameter of 
largest lymph node, bone marrow involvement and haemoglobin level) has been suggested for patients 
requiring treatment which may be more informative on progression-free survival (PFS) [5].

2.1.6.  Management 
Current  treatment  options  for  patients  with  previously  untreated  advanced  follicular  lymphoma 
according  to  recommendations  for  initial  treatment  of  follicular  lymphoma  in  ESMO  and  NCCN 
guidelines,  treatment  options  for  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  FL  include  “watch  and  wait”, 
radiotherapy, and systemic treatments. 
Systematic treatments include chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP, R-CVP, R-benda) and in selected cases 
(elderly/infirm  patients)  rituximab  monotherapy  (or  R-chlorambucil  for  elderly  patients).  For  patients 
who achieve response (CR/PR) rituximab maintenance is indicated. 
About the product 
Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA®, GAZYVARO®; also known as GA101 and RO5072759) is a glycoengineered, 
humanized Type II CD20 monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype. It consists of 
two heavy chains and two light chains with inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds, as is typical of IgG1 
antibodies. Obinutuzumab was derived by humanization of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and is 
produced in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) K1 cell line. It has been glycoengineered to improve a 
number of characteristics compared with the anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab. The calculated molecular 
mass  of  intact  obinutuzumab  is  146,321 Da  (peptide  chains  only,  with  heavy  chain  C-terminal  lysine 
residue and heavy chain N-terminal glutamines). 
Obinutuzumab recognizes a type II epitope of the CD20 molecule found on B cells. It has high-affinity 
binding  to  the  CD20  antigen,  low  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  activity,  high  direct  cell 
death  induction  and  high  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  and  antibody-dependent 
cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP).  Based  on  these  features  and  nonclinical  studies,  obinutuzumab  was 
expected to have improved efficacy with similar toxicity to rituximab, which is an established treatment 
for  patients  with  B-cell  malignancies,  including  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL),  non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) and other B-cell disorders. 
Obinutuzumab was first approved for use in combination with chlorambucil in the first-line treatment of 
patients  with  CLL  in  the  United  States  (US)  (November  2013),  the  European  Union  (EU)  (July  2014) 
and many other countries based on the results of the pivotal Phase III trial, study BO21004 (CLL-11).  
Obinutuzumab was later approved for use in combination with bendamustine in patients with follicular 
lymphoma (FL) who did not respond to a rituximab-containing regimen, in the US (February 2016) and 
in the EU (June 2016), based on the results of the pivotal Phase III trial, GAO4753g (GADOLIN).  
This  application  is  seeking  approval  of  an  additional  indication  for  obinutuzumab  in  patients  with 
previously  untreated  FL  based  on  the  results  of  the  pivotal  Phase  III  trial,  BO21223  (GALLIUM).  The 
proposed indication is as follows: 
“Gazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance therapy in patients 
achieving a response, is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced 
follicular lymphoma.” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017

the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA has not been submitted as part of this application (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects. 
No new non-clinical-related information is relevant for the present application. 
Since obinutuzumab is a monoclonal antibody and as such it is a protein (molecular mass ~150 kDa), 
it  is  exempted  from  the  submission  of  an  ERA  as  according  to  the  Guideline  on  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment  (ERA)  for  Non-GMO  Human  Medicinal  Products  [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr.  2]  an 
ERA  is  not  required  proteins  and  peptides,  as  “due  to  their  nature  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  a 
significant risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  primary  and  secondary  pharmacology  of  obinutuzumab  and  chemotherapy  drugs  has  been 
previously investigated. 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK model (Report 1072889): 
Analysis objectives: 
- 
To  update  a  previously  developed  population  model  [Report  No.  1065581]  that  describes 
pharmacokinetics  of  obinutuzumab  following  intravenous  administration  in  patients  with 
- 
- 
- 
- 
CD20+ B-cells malignancies. 
To re-estimate population PK parameters of the model 
To  determine  post-hoc  estimates  for  derived  PK  parameters  (steady-state  AUCτ,  Cmax, 
Ctrough, terminal half-life and effective half-life) 
To re-estimate the inter-individual variability of model parameters in the patient population 
To re-estimate the residual variability of the dependent variable (obinutuzumab concentration) 
in the patient population 
- 
To confirm and re-estimate the effects of previously identified covariate factors that influence 
disposition of obinutuzumab, and to estimate the effects of new covariates 
- 
To determine whether the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) affects pharmacokinetics of 
obinutuzumab 
following 
intravenous  administration 
in  patients  with  CD20+  B-cells 
malignancies 
- 
To perform model-based simulations of clinically relevant dosing regimens. 
The analyzed dataset:

The population PK model was previously built using data from studies BO20999, BO21000, BO21003, 
BO21004,  GAO4753g,  and  GAO4915g.  These  data  included  16301  serum  concentration  values  of 
obinutuzumab from a total of 961 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), FL (406 patients), 
MZL  (35  patients),  other  indolent  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (iNHL)  subtypes,  diffuse  large  B-cell 
lymphoma  (DLBCL),  or  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (MCL).  The  current  population  PK  analysis  added  the 
data from study BO21223 (7550 concentration values from a total of 493 patients with FL [408], MZL 
[84], and CLL [1]) to the previous data set, thus including a total of 23,851. 
Model characteristics: 
The  PK  model  comprises  two  clearance  pathways:  a  linear  clearance  and  a  nonlinear  time  varying 
clearance pathway (target mediated drug disposition: TMDD). This model was applied to the data and 
the  model  parameters  were  re-estimated  consecutively  to  the  inclusion  of  the  data  from  study 
BO21223.  The  estimated  parameters  are  reported  below  (Table  4)  as  well  as  the  parameters  of  the 
prior model (table 14) for analysis and comparison purpose.

Systemic exposure to obinutuzumab predictions: 
The model was used for the predictions of systemic exposure to obinutuzumab in the target population

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  mechanism  of  action  as  well  as  the  primary  and  secondary  pharmacology  of  obinutuzumab  and 
chemotherapy drugs has been previously investigated. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
As part of the study BO21223, B-cells counts and tumor size were measured in patients with FL and 
MZL. A PK-PD modelling has been attempted by the applicant in order to assess the relationship these 
PD endpoints and the systemic exposure. The PPK model described above was used in order to 
estimate the systemic exposure to obinutuzumab. 
Relationship between obinutuzumab exposure and time course of B-cell counts: 
The graphical analysis performed to assess the relationship between the observed values of B-cell 
counts and obinutuzumab exposure (Cmean) indicated that in all exposure groups B-cell counts 
declined from their baseline values to nearly zero after start of drug administration. B-cells remained

at very low levels for most patients (for majority of patients at BLQ levels) for most of the observation 
period (Figure 3).

-  Relationship between obinutuzumab exposure and tumor size decrease: 
A graphical analysis was  performed to assess the  relationship between the change in tumor size and 
obinutuzumab  exposure  (Figure  198).  Tumor  size  decreased  during  Induction  from  a  median  of 
approximately 5000 mm2 to 500 mm2 with a slow additional decrease during Maintenance. Change in 
tumor size was similar in all exposure categories.

Reduction  in  tumor  size  is  observed  in  all  Cmean  groups.  However,  no  optimal  target  mean 
concentration could be defined. 
In  the  submitted  PopPK  report  (September  2016),  ADAs  were  detected  in  29  patients  from  study 
BO21223 (5.8%). By comparison, ADAs were detected in 17 patients (5.5%) from study BO21004, 2 
patients  (2%)  from  study  GAO4915g,  1  patient  (0.5%)  from  study  GAO4753g.  All  ADAs  detected  in 
Study BO21223 were detected prior to initiation of obinutuzumab treatment only. In an update, 1/565 
patient (0.2% of patients with a post-baseline assessment)  developed  HAHA  at  induction  completion. 
While the clinical significance of HAHA is not known, a potential correlation between HAHA and clinical 
course  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Patients  with  detected ADAs  had  higher  initial  time-dependent  clearance 
and  a  higher  rate  of  decline  of  this  clearance,  but  the  same  time-independent  clearance  as  patients 
without ADAs, indicating a transient effect of ADAs on obinutuzumab concentrations only. 
The rate of ADAs observed in study BO21223 is comparable to that observed in previous studies. ADAs 
do  not  exhibit  a  neutralizing  activity  as  obinutuzumab  PKs  appears  to  have  no  clinically  impact  on 
systemic exposure.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Obinutuzumab is currently approved in patients with CLL in combination with chlorambucil non eligible 
to full-dose fludarabine and in patients with FL in combination with bendamustine who did not respond 
to rituximab or rituximab-containing regimen. In the current variation the applicant seeks the use of 
obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP or bendamustine) in previously 
untreated patients with FL. 
The claimed induction dosing scheme for the pursued new indication is slightly different from that 
currently approved. Indeed, when administered with CHOP or CVP shorter administration cycles are to 
be followed (eight 21-day cycles instead of six 28-day cycles). Consequently, the total dose of 
obinutuzumab in the induction phase is higher (8000 mg versus 6000) for patients treated with CHOP 
or CVP in the new indication. 
The pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab has been characterized using non compartmental analysis 
(NCA) in early studies but also and mainly through a population-PK approach (PPK) using all available, 
consisting mostly in sparse data collected during clinical studies. 
Study BO21223 is pivotal for the claimed indication. The study included PK sampling (approximately 23 
samples per obinutuzumab-treated patient) from a planned sample of 460 patients with FL or MZL who 
received obinutuzumab. The obinutuzumab PK data from Study BO21223 were added to the population 
PK dataset and the population PK model was updated. The presence of ADAs was also analyzed in all 
patients receiving obinutuzumab. Therefore, the previously developed PPK model was updated by the 
inclusion of data collected in study BO21223. The PPK model was refined and the model parameters 
were re-estimated. This update is provided by the applicant in report 1072889 and analyzed below.  
The current population PK model of obinutuzumab (with the inclusion of data from BO21223) was 
consistent with a previously developed model in patients with CLL, FL, other iNHL subtypes, DLBCL, 
and MCL. The model confirmed the influence of previously identified covariates (body weight, sex, 
tumor size and serum albumin at baseline, disease types [CLL, FL/DLBCL, MCL], iNHL subtypes [SLL], 
and concomitant chemotherapies [CHOP, CVP, bendamustine, FC]). The PK model also better 
quantified the influence of a MZL diagnosis compared to FL, with a slightly higher time-dependent 
clearance and a similar linear clearance. Doxorubicin (administered as part of CHOP regimen) had no 
influence on obinutuzumab PK. 
As typical for mAbs, obinutuzumab exposure is lower in patients with high body weight (following Q3W 
regimen, mean AUCτ and Ctrough at Cycle 8 of induction and Cycle 4 of maintenance is 31-39% higher 
for WT < 60 kg and 28% - 37% lower for WT >90 kg compared to patients weighting 60 – 90 kg), and 
is also lower in male patients (31%-43% lower in male FL patients compared to females). As most of 
the targeted agents, obinutuzumab exposure depends on tumor burden and therefore decreases in 
patients with high tumor size at baseline (following Q3W regimen in FL patients, mean AUCτ and 
Ctrough at Cycle 8 of induction and Cycle 4 of maintenance is 5% -7% higher for BSIZ < 2777 mm2 
and 1% - 2% lower for BSIZ >8998 mm2, compared to BSIZ of 2777 - 8998 mm2). 
The approach used by the applicant to characterize the PKs of obinutuzumab in the new target 
population (untreated patients with FL) and according to claimed dosing scheme could be considered 
acceptable. As expected, higher systemic exposure to obinutuzumab is observed in patients treated 
with bendamustine and obinutuzumab every 21 days comparatively to those receiving other 
chemotherapy (CHOP or CVP) and obinutuzumab every 28 days. The systemic exposure appears to be 
approximately proportional to the dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 26/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Body weight appears to be the most determinant factor for systemic exposure. For instance, systemic 
exposure in FL patients is estimated to be approximately doubled in patients weighing less than 60 Kg 
comparatively to those weighing more than 90 kg. In order to explore the the adequacy of the 
proposed dosing scheme PFS was compared in normal weighted (BMI  30 mg/m2 ) and in obese 
patients (BMI 30 mg/m2 and body weight  90 kg or  90 kg), and no significant difference was 
observed (see discussion on clinical efficacy) thus  confirming the fixed dose/regimen of 
obinutuzumab.   
Even though tumor size was identified as a significant covariate in the final model, the influence of 
tumor size on the systemic exposure to obinutuzumab remains limited.  
The influence of obinutuzumab on the PKs of the co-administered chemotherapies has not been 
formally investigated, however it is generally accepted –due to the nature of obinutuzumab- that any 
significant impact of on the PKs of concomitant chemotherapies is unlikely (See discussion on clinical 
safety).  
The PKs of obinutuzumab is adequately elucidated in the new group of patients (untreated patients 
with FL) treated with the claimed dosing scheme. The concentration time-course of obinutuzumab is 
accurately described by a two-compartment PK model with both time-dependant and time-independent 
clearance components (TMDD). The prior model was refined by the inclusion of the data collected in 
the pivotal study BO21223.  
Since obinutuzumab is given more frequently when combined with CHOP/CVP (every 21 days), higher 
obinutuzumab systemic exposure is observed compared to when obinutuzumab is given in combination 
with bendamustine (every 28 days). The systemic exposure appears to be approximately proportional 
to the dose. 
The influence of obinutuzumab on the PKs of the co-administered chemotherapies has not been 
formally investigated. But it could be agreed that significant impact of obinutuzumab on the PKs of the 
drugs used in chemotherapies is unlikely. 
No relationship between obinutuzumab exposure and time course of B-cell counts was established. The 
relationship between the observed values of B-cell counts and obinutuzumab exposure (Cmean) 
indicated that in all exposure groups B-cell counts declined from their baseline values to nearly zero 
after start of drug administration. B-cells remained at very low levels for most patients. 
The rate of ADAs observed in study BO21223 is comparable to that observed in previous studies. ADAs 
do not exhibit a neutralizing activity as obinutuzumab PKs appears to have no clinically impact on 
systemic exposure (See discussion on clinical safety). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology aspects of obinutuzumab in the proposed indication have been sufficiently 
characterised.

Adult patients with previously untreated indolent NHL were eligible for the study. 
Inclusion Criteria: 
Patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for the study entry: 
  Histologically  documented,  CD20-positive,  indolent  B-cell  NHL  consisting  of  one  of  the 
following: FL (Grades 1-3a), splenic MZL, nodal MZL, or extranodal MZL 
Tissue  diagnostic  procedures  had  to  be  performed  within  12  months  prior  to  randomization. 
Biopsy material from an excisional or core biopsy had to be submitted for retrospective central 
confirmation. Tissue samples dated >12  months prior to randomization were accepted only if 
tissue  material  was  available  for  retrospective  confirmation,  if there  was  no  clinical  indication 
for transformation of disease, and if the request for additional biopsy was unethical treatment 
of the patient. Bone marrow alone was not suitable to make the diagnosis of FL. 
Approximately  200  patients  with  MZL  (splenic,  nodal,  or  extranodal)  were  to  be  randomized. 
After reaching the cap of 200, recruitment of patients with MZL was stopped.

In patients with splenic MZL without splenic tissue available for histologic review, the diagnosis 
could  be  confirmed  by  the  presence  of  splenomegaly  and  typical  morphologic  and 
immunophenotypic findings in the blood and bone marrow. 
Bone marrow had to be submitted for retrospective central confirmation.

haemoglobin >10 g/dL, and/or platelet count > 100 x 109/L) 
o 
Involvement of ≥ 3 nodal sites, each with a diameter of ≥ 3 cm 
o  Symptomatic splenic enlargement

radiotherapy) and required therapy, as assessed by the investigator 
 
For  patients  with  symptomatic  gastric  extranodal  MZL:  Helicobacter  pylori-negative  disease 
that  was  de  novo  or  had  relapsed  following  local  therapy  (i.e.,  surgery  or  radiotherapy)  and 
required therapy, as assessed by the investigator, or H. pylori-positive disease that remained

by  the  investigator  (see  Appendix  G  of  the  protocol  for  additional  details  regarding  gastric 
extranodal MZL) 
  At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (> 2 cm in its largest dimension by CT scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) 
In patients with splenic MZL, an enlarged spleen on CT scan or extending at least 2 cm below 
the  costal  margin  by  physical  examination  constituted  measurable  disease  providing  that  no 
explanation  other  than  lymphomatous  involvement  was  likely.  For  an  enlarged  liver  to

Cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  and  bendamustine  have  a  moderate  risk  of  emesis.  It  was 
recommended  that  infusions  be  administered  following  premedication  with  a  serotonin  antagonist  or 
per institutional practice.

The  following  secondary  objectives  applied  to  patients  with  previously  untreated  advanced  indolent 
NHL (i.e., overall population) and to the subset of patients with previously untreated advanced FL (i.e., 
follicular population): 
 
To  evaluate  and  compare  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC)-assessed  PFS  between  the 
two arms. In the US, IRC-assessed PFS will be the basis of regulatory decisions. 
 
To evaluate and compare overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) after the end of 
induction treatment, as assessed by the investigator, between the two arms, with and without 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 
 
To evaluate and compare OR and CR after the end of induction treatment, as assessed by the 
IRC, between the two arms, with and without FDG-PET

To evaluate and compare overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival 
(DFS),  duration  of  response  (DOR),  and  time  to  next  anti-lymphoma  treatment  (TTNLT) 
between the two arms  
EFS, DFS, and DOR are based on investigator assessment. 
 
To  evaluate  and  compare  the  safety  profiles  between  the  two  arms  during  induction  and 
maintenance 
 
To  assess  patient-reported  outcomes  (PROs)  in  both  arms.  HRQoL  was  assessed  using  two 
self-administered validated questionnaires, FACT-Lym and EuroQol EQ-5D-3L.   
The exploratory objectives for this study were as follows: 
 
To evaluate and compare the proportion of patients who transformed to aggressive histology at 
first relapse between the two arms 
 
To  evaluate  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  partial  response  (PR)  or  stable  disease  (SD)  at 
the  end  of  induction  treatment  who  converted  to  CR  or  to  PR/CR,  respectively,  during 
maintenance treatment or post-induction observation, as assessed by the investigator 
 
To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of obinutuzumab in combination 
with chemotherapy

and during follow-up (IgH clonality could  be used  as a marker of MRD  in  patients without an 
identifiable BCL2/IgH translocation at baseline) 
 
To correlate FDG-PET results with efficacy parameters 
  A dedicated analysis to adequately assess PFS in the MZL subcohort was performed 
 
To  identify  and  characterize  changes  in  tumor  gene  expression  and  cell  surface  markers  that 
occur  in  patients  who  have  relapsed  and/or  transformed  after  initial  treatment  with  a

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  is  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  study.  PFS  is  defined  as  time 
from  the  day  of  randomization  until  the  first  documented  day  of  disease  progression,  symptomatic 
deterioration, disease transformation, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients who 
did not experience documented disease progression or death were censored at the last valid (SD, PR, 
CR) tumor assessment prior to the clinical cut-off date. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  EFS,  TTNLT,  DFS,  and  DOR  and  additionally  -  on  account  of  the 
primary  endpoint  crossing  the  pre-specified  boundary-  key  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in 
hierarchical order by the fixed sequence testing procedure. 
  CR  rate  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  FL  population  based  on  tumor  assessment 
without PET 
  CR rate at the end of induction therapy in the overall population based on tumor assessment 
without PET 
  Overall survival in the FL population; Overall survival in the overall population 
OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. 
OS for patients who were not reported to have died at the time of the analysis were censored 
at the date when they were last known to be alive as documented by the investigator. 
  ORR at the end of induction therapy in the FL population based on tumor assessment without 
PET 
  ORR  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  overall  population  based  on  tumor  assessment 
without  PET.  The  ORR  is  defined  as  the  percentage  of  patients  with  CR  or  PR  as  the  end-of-
induction response. All other cases are designated non-responders. 
All analyses are based on the investigator’s assessment. Analyses of PFS, CR rate, and ORR are based 
on IRC assessments in the application for the FDA registration.  
EFS,  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  to  disease  progression/relapse, 
death  from  any  cause,  or  initiation  of  a  NALT.  If  the  specified  event  (disease  progression/relapse, 
death, or initiation of a NALT) did not occur, EFS was censored at the date of last tumor assessment. 
For patients without an event who have not had post-baseline tumor assessments, EFS was censored 
on the date of randomization. 
Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNLT) is defined as the time from the date of randomization 
to  the  start  date  of  the  next  anti-lymphoma  treatment  or  death  from  any  cause.  Patients  without  a 
TTNLT event were censored at the date at which the patient was last known to be alive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 35/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented 
CR to the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause (PFS event). DFS is evaluated 
for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  a  response  of  CR  at  any  time  prior  to  NALT.  DFS  for  patients  who 
have had no documented disease progression, relapse, or have not died after CR, were censored at the 
last disease assessment date. 
Duration of response, defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or 
PR to the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause (PFS event) for the subgroup 
of patients with a response of CR or PR any time prior to NALT. For patients achieving a response who 
have  not  experienced  disease  progression,  relapse,  or  died  prior  to  the  time  of  the  analysis,  the 
duration of response was censored on the date of last disease assessment. 
Sample size 
The primary analysis of the study tested the equality of PFS distributions in the R-chemo and G-chemo 
arms  the  following  null  hypothesis  with  use  of  a  two-sided  stratified  log  rank  test  at  an  overall  5% 
significance level: 
 
Equality  of  PFS  distributions  in  the  G-chemo  and  R-chemo  arms  in  the  FL  population  by 
investigator assessment: H0: PFSG-chemo = PFSR-chemo versus H1: SG-chemo ≠ SR-chemo 
In  the  FL  subset,  estimates  on  the  number  of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with 
 
 
 
respect to PFS were based on the following assumptions: 
Two-sided log rank test at the 0.05 level of significance 
Powered for the FL population 
Eighty  percent  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  (HR)  for  G-chemo  versus  R-chemo  of  0.74, 
corresponding to an improvement in 3-year PFS from 70.7% to 77.4% or in median PFS from 
6 years to 8.1 years (35%). Note that estimates of median PFS were not likely to be reached in 
either study arm at either interim or final PFS analysis 
 
Exponential distribution of PFS 
  An annual dropout rate of 2.5% 
Performance  of  interim  analysis  on  PFS:  one  futility  analysis  when  approximately  30%  of  the  total 
(investigator-assessed) PFS events had occurred and one efficacy analysis when approximately 67% of 
the total (investigator-assessed) PFS events had occurred. Efficacy and (nonbinding) futility boundaries 
were  calculated  using  the  Lan-DeMets  approximation  to  the  O-Brien-Fleming  boundary  shape. 
Resulting significance levels at the interim and final analyses are documented in the SAP. 
In addition, a futility analysis based on CR rates at the end of induction as determined by CT (or MRI, 
but not PET), was performed on the first 170 randomized patients with FL. 
With  the  above  assumptions,  370  PFS  events  were  required  to  achieve  80%  power  for  the  primary 
analysis. Recruitment was staggered in order  to recruit the first 170 patients at a smaller number of 
sites,  followed  by  the  activation  of  all  sites  after  the  IDMC  meeting  for  futility  based  on  CR  rates.  It 
was  expected  that  during the  first  stage,  after  a 6-month  ramp  up,  18  patients  per  month  would  be 
recruited, and after the IDMC meeting and another  4-month ramp  up, an  accrual  rate  of 37 patients 
per month was expected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017

The  1200  patients  with  FL  enrolled  over  49  months  and  followed  for  an  additional  29  months  after 
randomization of the last patients were required to provide 370 PFS events, with a total duration for 
PFS follow-up of approximately 78 months (6.5 years). 
Although  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  is  the  investigator-assessed  PFS,  PFS  based  on  IRC 
assessments  was  also  analyzed  to  support  the  primary  analysis.  In  the  United  States,  IRC-assessed 
PFS will be the basis for regulatory decisions. Approximately 200 additional patients with non-follicular 
lymphoma  (i.e.,  with  MZL)  were  enrolled.  This  number  was  selected  on  the  basis  of  estimation  from 
the  enrolment  feasibility  assessment  prior  to  the  start  of  the  study.  This  estimation  indicated  that  at 
least  200  patients  with  MZL  would  likely  be  enrolled  in  49  months,  in  addition  to  the  planned 
enrollment  of  1200  patients  with  FL.  As  such,  data  from  the  patients  with  MZL  can  be  interpreted  in 
context  of  subgroup  analyses.  However,  this  subgroup  was  not  powered  to  detect  statistically 
significant differences.  
Randomisation 
1202 eligible patients with FL who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 
1:1  ratio  to  either  G-chemo  followed  by  G-maintenance  in  responders  or  R-chemo  followed  by  R-
maintenance in responders. In addition, 195 patients with MZL were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to the two treatment arms. There were an additional 4 patients with non-FL. 
Randomization was stratified for the following factors: 
1. Chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) 
2.  FLIPI  (for  FL:  low,  intermediate,  or  high)/IPI  (for  MZL:  low/low-intermediate  or  high-
intermediate/high) group (see the protocol for further details) 
3.  Geographic  region  (Western  Europe,  Eastern  Europe,  South  and  Central  America,  North  America, 
other)  
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  an  open-label  study;  however  the  IRC  was  blinded  to  treatment  assignment  throughout. 
Clinical Scientists from the MAH’s study team reviewed eCRF data for ambiguous, contradictory and/or 
potentially  erroneous  data  entry  as  part  of  routine  data  cleaning.  For  these  activities,  they  were  not 
blinded  to  treatment  allocation  on  an  individual  patient  basis.  However,  no  aggregated  efficacy  or 
safety  analyses  by  treatment  arm  were  conducted  by  the  Sponsor  using  unblinded  data  before  the 
IDMC released the data following the interim analysis. 
At  the  pre-specified  interim  analysis  for  efficacy,  the  IDMC  recommended  that  the  study  be  fully 
analyzed because the pre-specified boundary for the primary endpoint, investigator-assessed PFS, had 
been  crossed  and  the  results  were  considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  Sponsor  endorsed  this 
recommendation  and  the  interim  analysis  is  now  considered  the  primary  analysis  of  efficacy.  The 
Sponsor was only exposed to aggregate efficacy or safety analyses by treatment arm after the IDMC 
recommendation and Sponsor decision. 
Statistical methods 
A  two-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  (0.05  significance  level)  stratified  by  chemotherapy  regimen 
(CHOP,  CVP,  or  bendamustine)  and  Follicular  Lymphoma  International  Prognostic  Index  (FLIPI)  risk 
group (low, intermediate, or high) in patients with FL, or international prognostic index (IPI) risk group 
(low  or  low-intermediate  vs.  high-intermediate  or  high)  was  used  for  the  primary  analysis.  Kaplan-
Meier  methodology  was  used  to  estimate  PFS  distribution  for  each  treatment  arm.  Estimates  of

treatment  effect  were  expressed  as  hazard  ratios  through  the  use  of  a  stratified  Cox  proportional 
hazards analysis, including 95% confidence intervals. 
PFS was compared using a two-sided log-rank test stratified by chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, or 
bendamustine),  FL  international  prognostic  index  (FLIPI)  risk  group  (low,  intermediate,  or  high)  in 
patients  with  FL  or  international  prognostic  index  (IPI)  risk  group  (low  or  low-intermediate  vs.  high-
intermediate or high) in patients with non-follicular lymphoma. 
Estimates of the treatment effect are expressed as hazard ratios, estimated with the use of a stratified 
Cox  model,  including  95%  confidence  limits.  An  unstratified  log-rank  test  was  also  performed  as  a 
sensitivity analysis. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate median (if reached), 2-year and 
3-year PFS and 95% CIs for each treatment arm, and the Kaplan-Meier curve is provided for a visual 
description of the difference across treatment arms. 
Three interim analyses were planned: two for futility (one on CR and one on PFS) and one for efficacy 
(on PFS).  
The first interim analysis was based on differences in end-of-induction CR rates in the first 170 enrolled 
patients with FL. The IDMC reviewed the  data on  24  October 2012 and recommended that the study 
continue. 
The  second  interim  analysis  (futility  on  PFS)  was  conducted  when  30%  of  the  required  investigator-
assessed  PFS  events  (i.e.,  approximately  111  events)  had  occurred.  The  clinical  data  cutoff  for  the 
second  interim  analysis  was  20  February  2014.  The  IDMC  reviewed  the  data  on  31  July  2014  and 
recommended that the study continue. 
The  third  interim  analysis  (efficacy)  was  planned  after  67%  of  the  events  had  occurred  (i.e. 
approximately 248 events), and all patients had been enrolled and followed for an estimated minimum 
of 11 months. The clinical cutoff date for the third interim analysis was 31 January 2016. This analysis 
is  now  referred  to  as  the  primary  analysis.  The  IDMC  reviewed  the  data  on  20  May  2016  and 
recommended  that  the  study  be  fully  analyzed  at  this  time,  as  the  primary  endpoint  had  been  met. 
The IDMC recommendations are provided. 
PFS was analyzed for the follicular lymphoma population based on assessments by the investigators as 
well  as  by  the  IRC;  both  investigator-  and  IRC-assessed  PFS  endpoints  were  analyzed  in  the  same 
manner. In the US, IRC-assessed PFS will be the basis of regulatory decisions. It was anticipated that 
in the worst case, the number of corresponding IRC  events at clinical cutoff would be,  at most, 10% 
lower  than  the  number  of  investigator-assessed  events.  Such  a  worst  case  loss  in  number  of  events 
would  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  power  of  approximately  5%  to  detect  the  assumed  treatment 
difference. All analyses of PFS and secondary efficacy endpoints were performed for the FL population 
and  the  overall  population,  with  the  exception  of  PFS,  which  was  analysed  only  in  the  overall 
population  as  a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  (PFS  for  the  follicular  population  is  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint). Patients were analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
To adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, thereby 
controlling  the  overall  Type  I  error  rate  at  a  two-sided  0.05  level  of  significance,  the  fixed  sequence 
testing procedure (Westfall and Krishen 2001) was used. These endpoints were tested in the following 
order:  
 
PFS in the overall population 
  CR  rate  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  FL  population  based  on  tumor  assessment 
without PET

The primary efficacy analysis population is the intent-to-treat follicular lymphoma population (FL ITT), 
defined as all randomized patients with follicular histology. Efficacy analyses were conducted according 
to  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  principle,  where  patients  were  grouped  according  to  their  randomized 
treatment arm regardless of what treatments were actually received. 
The  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  also  determined  in  the  intent-to-treat 
population, defined as all randomized patients (overall population, ITT). 
Pharmacokinetic analyses and the evaluable population are defined in a separate analysis plan. Patient 
data was included in the pharmacokinetic analysis if they contained sufficient dosing information and at 
least one adequately documented and quantifiable concentration per patient. 
The  safety  analysis  population  included  all  patients  who  received  any  amount  of  study  drug 
(obinutuzumab,  rituximab,  or  chemotherapy  [CHOP,  CVP,  or  bendamustine]),  and  patients  were 
analyzed according to the treatment received (i.e., a patient who received obinutuzumab at least once 
for  any  reason  was  analyzed  under  the  G-chemo  treatment  arm;  if  only  chemotherapy  and/or 
rituximab was received, the patient was analysed under the R-chemo treatment arm).

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Overall Population) 
In the overall population, the median age was 60.0 years (range: 23 to 88 years). The G-chemo arm 
had more patients > 60 years old than the R-chemo arm (53.0% vs 47.8%, respectively). The 
majority of patients were White (82.4% [1154/1401] of patients). Overall, more female than male 
patients were randomized (739/1401 patients [52.7%] vs. 662/1401 patients [47.3%]).  
The majority of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (96.8%). Overall, 60.2% of patients 
were classified as stage IV according to Ann Arbor criteria. Baseline B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, 
weight loss) were present in 34.5% of patients. FCγ receptor polymorphism results were available for 
1332/1401 patients (95.1%) for the FCγreceptor IIa and IIIa, and 1245/1401 patients (88.9%) for the 
FCγ receptor IIb analyses. For FCγ receptor IIa, overall the 131HR genotype was most frequent 
(47.5% of patients) and the frequency was comparable in both treatment arms. For FCreceptor IIIa, 
the 158FF genotype was  most frequent (44.9% of patients) in the R-chemo arm, but the 158VF 
genotype was most frequent (48.5% of patients) in the G-chemo arm. For FCreceptor IIb/IIc, overall 
the 232II genotype was most frequent (78.1% of patients) and the frequency was comparable in both 
treatment arms. 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (MZL Population) 
Regarding geographic region, the R-chemo arm had more patients from Eastern Europe than the G-
chemo arm (16.7% versus 10.1%; respectively). There were 32/195 patients (16.4%) who received 
CHOP chemotherapy (18/96 patients [18.8%] in the R-chemo arm and 14/99 patients [14.1%] in the 
G-chemo arm). There were 24/195 patients (12.3%) who received CVP chemotherapy (12/96 patients 
[12.5%] in the R-chemo arm and 12/99 patients [12.1%] in the G-chemo arm). There were 139/195 
Assessment report

patients (71.3%) who received bendamustine chemotherapy (66/96 patients [68.8%] in the R-chemo 
arm and 73/99 patients [73.7%] in the G-chemo arm). 
Central Pathology Assessments (Overall Population) 
As randomization was stratified according to FLIPI group for FL (low, intermediate, or high) or IPI 
group for MZL (low/low-intermediate or high-intermediate/high), among other criteria, patients were 
randomized separately depending on their diagnosis (FL or MZL). The investigator provided the 
diagnosis as two categories, FL or non-FL, to IxRS. The investigator reported the diagnosis in the eCRF 
in three categories: FL, non-FL (with subtypes), or other. Three patients had an eCRF diagnosis of 
other: (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [transformed FL]; R-chemo), (DBCL; G-chemo), and CLL; G-
chemo).

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis for PFS by INV 
The robustness of the PFS results (by investigator or IRC review) was assessed by performing a series 
of pre-specified sensitivity analyses applying alternative censoring rules or specific analysis criteria

characteristics (FL ITT population) 
Concordance rate between PFS by INV and IRC 
Agreement  between  the  IRC  and  the  Investigator  on  the  type  of  PFS  event  (i.e.,  agreement  on 
assignment  of  PD,  death  or  no  event  per  patient)  was  high  (92.1%  overall)  and  balanced  between 
arms (91.0% in the R-chemo arm vs. 93.2% in the G-chemo arm). In particular, for the R-chemo arm, 
the Investigator and IRC agreed that progression had not occurred in 444 of 601 patients (73.9%) and 
that  progression  had  occurred  in  91  of  601  patients  (15.1%).  Similarly,  for  the  G-chemo  arm,  the 
Investigator and the IRC agreed that progression had not occurred in 486 of 601 patients (80.9%) and 
had occurred in 54 of 601 patients (9.0%). The majority of discordance between IRC-and Investigator 
PFS events was related to cases where the Investigator registered a progression event, but the IRC did 
not (54 patients; Table 29). Note that once  the  Investigator had  diagnosed progression, no more CT 
scans  were  expected  to  be  available  to  the  IRC,  preventing  subsequent  registration  of  disease 
progression. A small subset of these cases (7/54) were related to disease transformation.

Disease Transformation 
Of  the  1202  patients  with  Follicular  Lymphoma  enrolled  in  the  study,  210  patients  (17.5%)  had 
documented progression (130/601 patients in the R-chemo arm [21.6%], and 80/601 patients in the 
G-chemo arm [13.3%]). Disease transformation (to a high grade malignancy or DLBCL) was reported 
for  29/601  patients  (4.8%)  in  the  R-chemo  arm,  and  18/601  patients  (3.0%)  in  the  G-chemo  arm 
(Table 33), with a difference in transformation rates of - 1.8% (95% CI:  - 4.1, 0.4). When considered 
as a percentage of patients with disease progression, 22.3% of patients in the R-chemo arm (29/130) 
and 22.5% of patients in the G-chemo arm (18/80) progressed with disease transformation. 
Table 21 Proportion of patients with disease transformation (FL ITT population) 
Response conversion during maintenance treatment 
At the end of the induction therapy, 794/1201 patients (66.1%) achieved a PR (379 patients (63.1%) 
in  the  R-chemo  arm  vs.  415  patients  (69,1%)  in  the  G-chemo  arm).  A  total  of  493  patients  with  an 
end  of  induction  response  of  PR  also  had  an  available  end  of  maintenance  response  assessment.  Of 
these  patients,  an  improvement  in  response  to  CR  during  maintenance  was  observed  in  97/222 
patients (43.7%) in the R-chemo arm, compared with 134/271 patients (49.4%) on the G-chemo arm. 
End of Maintenance Response (FL ITT Population) 
A non-pre-specified end of maintenance response (EOMR) analysis was conducted. EOMR was defined 
as  the  first  response  assessment  that  occurred  after  the  last  dose  of  maintenance  treatment.  The 
population included all patients randomized other than those who had not yet reached the end of the 
maintenance  assessment.  Patients  with  disease  progression  or  death  at  any  time  or  with  missing 
response  assessments  at  the  end  of  maintenance  were  considered  non-responders.  This  analysis  is 
similar  to  that  exploring  conversion,  but  includes  all  randomized  patients  in  the  study  long  enough, 
i.e., also early withdrawals and non-responders, within the denominator. 
Based on the Investigator assessment, 712/1058 patients with FL (67.3%) achieved a CR or PR at the 
end of maintenance phase: 341 patients (64.0% [95% CI: 59.7, 68.1]) in the R-chemo arm and 371 
patients (70.7% [95% CI: 66.6, 74.5]) in the G-chemo arm, an absolute difference of 6.7% (95% CI: 
1.0, 12.4; p-value = 0.0197, CMH test) in favor of G-chemo at this time point. Similarly, an absolute 
difference in CR rate of 2.5% (95% CI: - 3.5, 8.4; p-value = 0.39, CMH test) was found in favor of G-
chemo at this time point (Table 22)

When response was assessed by IRC, the IRC assessed EOMR was similar to the Investigator assessed 
EOMR with 65.1% (95% CI: 60.9, 69.2) for the R-chemo arm and 70.9% (95% 
CI:  66.8,  74.8)  for  the  G-chemo  arm;  and  CR  rates  were  42.6%  (95%  CI:  38.4,  46.9)  and  45.2% 
(95% CI: 40.9, 49.6), respectively.

Supportive study 
The data to support the current application to extend the use of obinutuzumab to previously untreated 
patients with FL comes from one pivotal Phase III study, with supporting data from a Phase Ib study: 
BO21000 (GAUDI): An open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase Ib study to investigate the safety 
and  efficacy  of  RO5072759  given  in  combination  with  CHOP,  FC  or  bendamustine  chemotherapy  in 
patients with CD20+ B-cell follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

In Study BO21000, the number of scheduled obinutuzumab doses  was lower than in Study  BO21223 
since only two doses of obinutuzumab were scheduled in Cycle 1 (on Day 1 and 8 in BO21000 vs. Day 
1, 8, and 15 in BO21223), fewer treatment cycles were scheduled during induction (4 or 6 for G-benda 
and 6 or 8 for G-CHOP in BO21000 vs. 6 for G-benda and 8 for G-CHOP or G-CVP in BO21223), and 
because  of  less  frequent  maintenance  dosing  (every  3  months  for  a  total  of  8  maintenance  doses  in 
BO21000 vs. every 2 months for a total of 12 maintenance doses in BO21223). The number of planned 
chemotherapy cycles was also lower in BO21000 than in BO21223.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  Applicant  has  provided  one pivotal,  randomised  (1:1),  open-label,  phase  III  study  (BO21223) to 
support  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication.  The  study  included  patients  with  previously 
untreated stage III/IV or stage II Bulky disease (>7cm) Follicular Lymphoma (FL). Patients with Grade 
3b FL  are  excluded from  the study as  reflected in  the SmPC, since  they usually are  more aggressive 
and treated as DLBCL. The recent GOYA study comparing R-CHOP with G-CHOP in patients with DLBCL 
showed that the latter was not superior to the first. Patients with Grade 3b FL  are in clinical practise 
perceived to behave as DLBCL.  
The  choice  of  backbones  (CHOP,  CVP  or  bendamustine)  and  regimens  are  fully  acceptable,  since  R-
CHOP,  R-CVP  and  R-B  followed  by  rituximab  maintenance  are  considered  standard  of  care  in  this 
patient population.  
Randomisation  and  the  three  stratification  factors  are  acceptable.  The  stratification  factors  are: 
Chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine),  FLIPI (for FL:  low,  intermediate,  or high)/IPI 
(for  MZL:  low/low-intermediate  or  high-intermediate/high)  group  and  geographic  region  (Western 
Europe,  Eastern  Europe,  South  and  Central  America,  North  America,  other).  It  is  noted  that 
randomization occurred separately for the patients with FL and MZL. The Western Europe region only 
included countries within the European Union. 
The  trial  was  adequately  powered  for  the  FL  population  (in  line  with  the  claimed  indication),  with  3 
planned  interim  analyses  (2  for  futility,  one  for  efficacy)  using  the  O’Brien-Fleming  sequential 
procedure  for  controlling  the  overall  0.05  type-1  error,  with  a  nominal  type-1  error  of  0.012  for  the 
efficacy  interim  analysis.  Calculations  were  based  upon  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.741    representing  a  26% 
reduction  risk  of  disease progression.  Assuming  a 6-year  PFS  in  the  R-Chemo  arm  and  exponentially 
distributed PFS times, this corresponds to a 2.1-years increase of median PFS with Gazyvaro compared 
to  SOC.  Analysis  in  the  MZL  cohort  was  exploratory  only;  therefore  no  power  calculation  was 
performed for this subgroup of subjects.  
The primary objective of this study is to compare efficacy between R-chemo and G-chemo in terms of 
Progression-free survival as assessed by Investigator. PFS is fully acceptable in patients with FL, since 
the course of the disease typically stretches over years to decades. The Applicant has included PFS by 
IRC  as  a  secondary  objective.  This  is  acknowledged  since  the  study  is  open-label.  To  adjust  for 
multiple  statistical  testing  of  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  the  Applicant  has 
applied  a  fixed  sequence  testing  procedure.  Other  secondary  objectives/endpoints  include  OS,  EFS, 
TTNALT, DFS and DOR. The testing of  EFS, TTNALT, DFS and DOR  were not adjusted for multiplicity, 
and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

The Applicant applied 3 planned IA’s. However, the first two IAs were concerned with futility, while the 
last IA was related to PFS (efficacy) and was planned after 67% of the events had occurred.  
The protocol was amended 4 times. None of the amendments are considered critical for conduct of the 
study or the interpretation of data. With regard to protocol deviations, the overall number of deviations 
is  similar between  the  two  arms.  In  the  updated  analysis  427  patients  in  the  G-chemo  arm  and  418 
patients in the R-chemo arm had  at least  one  deviation. The subcategory “other tumour  or  response 
related  assessments”  comprised  194  patients  in  the  G-chemo  arm  and  187  patients  in  the  R-chemo 
arm.  The  pattern  of  deviations  is  more  or  less  similar,  the  majority  of  deviations  in  the  subcategory 
included “missing” or “out of window” MRD assessments, missing laboratory assessments or related to 
patients with MZL who were not the target population. The deviations were considered having no direct 
impact on the primary endpoint.  
In general, the baseline demographic characteristics are well balanced between the two treatment 
arms. The majority of patients are white, below 65 years of age. Mean age is approximately 58 years. 
There are slightly more patients in the age group 60-69 years in the G-chemo arm. If any, this is in 
favour of the R-chemo arm. The baseline disease characteristics are well balanced. The majority of 
patients had ECOG score of 0 or 1, Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4, FLIPI score intermediate or high. Slightly 
more patients had Bulky disease at baseline in the R-chemo arm, however, the difference is not 
considered major. Baseline B-symptoms are well balanced without any major differences. Overall, at 
baseline, patients in the two treatment arms had similar levels of HRQoL (as measured by the FACT-
Lym questionnaire) and health status (as measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire).  Patients in both 
treatment arms had some impairment of physical function, functional wellbeing, emotional and social 
function at baseline as a result of their disease, similar to that reported in the literature in a sample of 
newly diagnosed patients with FL (Pettengell et al, 2009), and in other cancer and non-cancer 
populations (Janda et al 2009; Brucker at al 2005).

The dosing rationale was based on a comprehensive review of safety, efficacy and PK data in Phase I 
studies. A unit dose of 1000 mg for all infusions was chosen as the dose to be used in future Phase II 
and Phase III studies since it was the dose most likely to be well tolerated and efficacious in a majority 
of  NHL  patients  regardless  of  their  initial  tumor  burden.  Furthermore,  PK  modelling  suggested  that 
additional  doses  of  obinutuzumab  on  Days  8  and  15  of  Cycle  1  would  saturate  the  target-mediated 
clearance,  achieve  a  steady  state  of  drug  early,  and  maintain  it  for  the  duration  of  treatment.  In 
addition,  when  used  as  monotherapy  in  the  iNHL  Phase  II  extension  portion  of  the  BO20999  study, 
obinutuzumab showed greater efficacy with doses around 1000 mg compared with lower doses of 400 
mg,  with  a  doubling  of  response  rate  in  rituximab-refractory  patients.  The  maintenance  regimen  of 
2-monthly  dosing  for  up  to  two  years  was  also  familiar  to  clinicians  as  this  regimen  is  used  for  R-
maintenance in patients with previously untreated FL and had been shown to be safe in the Phase I/II 
obinutuzumab Studies BO21003 and BO21000.   
The median PFS by INV was not reached in any arm at the time of analysis. The HR for PFS in the FL 
population was 0.66, p-value 0.0012. The results of the primary endpoint are further supported by the 
key  secondary  endpoint,  PFS  by  IRC.  The  concordance  rate  between  the  two  analyses  is  considered 
acceptable  and  in  line  with  what  has  previously  been  accepted.  The  IRC-assessment  hazard  ratio  is 
0.71  [95%  CI:  0.54,  0.93]  and  is  in  the  range  of  the  expected  reduction  risk  in  FL  population.  The 
study  was  stopped  for  efficacy  based  on  IDMC  recommendations  as  planned  and  described  in  the 
protocol.  
In order to confirm the proposed dosing scheme -since body weight was the most determinant factor 
for systemic exposure (See Clinical Pharmacology)-  PFS was compared in normal weighted and in 
obese patients and similar PFS observed in patients with BMI  30 mg/m2 or  30 mg/m2 and body 
weight  90 kg or  90 kg. The lack of relationship between exposure and PFS previously reported in 
Study BO21223, confirm the recommended fixed dose/regimen of 1000 mg of obinutuzumab for 
previously untreated patients with FL across the whole range of body weight.  These findings are also 
consistent with saturation of CD20+ tumor cells during the course of treatment.  Therefore, a body 
weight-adjusted dosing is unlikely to improve PFS in patients with extreme body weight, such as obese 
patients. 
OS data in the updated analysis were also consistent with the primary analysis, showing no significant 
effect of G-chemo as compared to R-chemo. The Applicant will provide updated OS data at the time of 
the final analysis post authorisation. This is as expected, due to the natural history of the disease, the 
OS data are not mature, but there is no indication of any detrimental effect.  
In  terms  of  OS  across  subgroups,  findings  of  higher  number  of  AEs  of  fatal  outcome  in  the  G-benda 
and  R-benda  arms  as  compared  to  the  other  chemotherapy  backbones  are  discussed  under  Clinical 
Safety.  A  comparison  between  chemotherapy  backbones  is  difficult  in  view  that  this  is  not  a 
randomised comparison and that there are likely confounding factors due to patient selection. Indeed, 
although  small  numbers,  patients  in  the  R-benda  and  G-benda  subgroup  were  of    older  age  >  80 
years, had more baseline comorbidity and/or new anti-lymphoma treatment than patients in the CHOP 
subgroups.  More mature OS data are needed to further investigate the impact of these findings. 
With  regard  to  secondary  endpoints,  EFS,  DOR  and  TTNALT  data  are  consistent  with  the  primary 
endpoint and show a benefit in favour of G-chemo. It needs to be highlighted that EFS, DOR andDFS 
were not adjusted for multiplicity. With regard to DFS, data are not mature, but there is no indication 
of any detrimental effect.   
When  comparing  progression  disease  events  between  investigators  and  IRC  at  the  end  of  treatment 
induction,  agreement  is  relatively  high,  reaching  0.75  kappa  values  in  both  arms.  However,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 70/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agreement between both assessment bodies is lower when it involves the whole range of events (CR, 
PR,  SD,  PD  and  unevaluable).  The  observed  discrepancies  between  investigators  and  IRC  PFS 
assessments were all addressed, especially in case of conflicting assessments (not evaluable response 
or disease progression vs positive response). Conflicting situations were equally observed in both arms 
(8.3%  and  8.9%  respectively  in  G-  and  R-Chemo).  A  focus  on  all  possible  impacts  on  the  patient 
management  from  these  specific  conflicting  situations  showed  no  detrimental  effect  on  the  affected 
patients. 
Several  pre-specified  sensitivity  analysis  of  PFS  were  conducted.  All  analyses,  except  for  one,  were 
consistent with the primary analyses. The  “impact of  loss to follow-up”  (worst case  analysis) showed 
no  difference  between  the  two  treatment  arms.  Thus,  even  when  patients  in  G-chemo  arm  withdrew 
prior to disease progression and were consequently counted as “events” in the sensitivity analysis, the 
result indicate that G-chemo is at least non-inferior to R-chemo. Overall, the sensitivity analyses show 
that the primary estimate is robust and reliable.  
Subgroups analyses  in both the IRC and INV  assessed  PFS are  consistent  with the  primary estimate. 
With regard to subgroup analysis of PFS by INV by stratification factors, no relevant difference in terms 
of chemotherapy backbone or region was shown.  There seems to be no difference  between G-chemo 
and  R-chemo  in  patients  with  FLIPI  score  low.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  these  patients  in 
general  have  low  disease  activity,  leading  to  difficulties  in  showing  a  difference  between  the  two 
treatment  arms  or  the  fact  that  patients  with  FLIPI  score  low  only  comprised  21%  of  the  ITT 
population. No explanation could be found as to why obinutuzumab had no effect in the FLIPI low score 
subgroup, however these results were reported in the SmPC.   
No significant difference according to transformation of the disease is seen in the G-chemo population 
versus the R-chemo population, which is reassuring.  
Over the course of treatment, HRQoL was similar in the two treatment arms.  Patients in both arms 
experienced clinically meaningful improvements in lymphoma-specific symptoms and the summary 
scales that included this subscale (i.e., TOI, Lym-Total).  No clear differences were detected in HRQoL 
between the two treatment arms and at no timepoint during the study, however, the value of these 
subjective data are limited in an open-label study.  
The Applicant has also provided a supportive study, BO21000, a small phase 1b study that investigates 
obinutuzumab in combination with CHOP and bendamustine. The study is divided in two parts, where 
the second part of the study included previously untreated patients. Since study BO21000 main 
objective is safety, the interpretation of efficacy should be cautious, however, the secondary endpoints 
included efficacy measures, such as PFS, TTNALT, DOR, ORR and EFS, and seems to provide 
supportive evidence for the findings in the pivotal study.  
It is noted that patients with Grade 3b FL were excluded from the pivotal study. These patients are in 
the clinical setting often treated with R-CHOP. The GOYA study comparing R-CHOP with O-CHOP in 
patients with DLCBL showed that the latter was not superior to the first. Patients with Grade 3b FL are 
in clinical practise perceived to behave as DLBCL, and are as such treated the same way. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  Applicant  has  provided  the  BO21223  study,  that  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically  relevant  improvement  of  PFS  in  patients  with  FL  being  treated  with  obinutuzumab 
+chemotherapy  (bendamustine,  CHOP  or  CVP)  compared  with  Rituximab+chemotherapy,  thus  the 
study  met  its  primary  endpoint.  The  primary  results  are  confirmed  by  PFS  by  IRC  and  all  sensitivity 
analyses support these findings. Furthermore, the findings are consistent across all relevant subgroups

and stratification factors. 
Updated analysis of PFS and OS were performed with 6.6 months additional median follow-up (data 
cut-off as of 10 September 2016). The investigator-assessed PFS demonstrated a HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 
0.54, 0.87), p=0.0016, being consistent with the primary analysis. The updated OS data were also 
consistent with the primary analysis, showing no significant effect of G-chemo as compared to R-
chemo. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary safety data for patients receiving first-line  treatment  for FL  are derived from  the pivotal 
Phase III study BO21223 (GALLIUM) with 595 patients treated with G-chemo, but safety of the overall 
population (FL + MZL and other NHL) are provided with 698 patients treated with G-chemo. 
The safety of obinutuzumab from the GALLIUM study is supported by data from 81 patients from the 
Phase Ib  study  BO21000  (GAUDI)  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (induction 
therapy), followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy in patients with FL.  
Safety data are presented separately for the induction, maintenance and follow-up phases. Data have 
been  collected  up  to  31 January  2016,  which  corresponds  to  the  clinical  cut-off  date  for  the  third 
interim  analysis  for  efficacy.  Safety  data  from  Studies  BO21223  and  BO21000  are  presented 
separately  as  of  the  different  drug  exposures  during  induction  (difference  in  number  of  cycles  and 
doses), the different maintenance dosage schedules (every 2 months in BO21223 and every 3 months 
in BO21000), different eligibility requirements for maintenance, and the large difference in population 
sizes between the studies (595 vs 81 patients). 
Safety data collection 
Safety  monitoring  comprised  the  collection  of  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs), 
protocol-specified  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  urinalysis  variables,  vital  signs,  pharmacodynamic 
parameters, and immunological tests. SAE was defined as any experience that suggested a significant 
hazard,  contraindication,  side  effect,  or  precaution  (see  ICH  Guideline  for  Clinical  Safety  Data 
Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2). The severity of all adverse 
events was graded on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5) and reported in detail on the eCRF according to 
the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  (NCI  CTCAE)  version  4.0  for  Study 
BO21223  and  version  3.0  for  Study  BO21000.  All  deaths  are  summarized  by  analysis  population, 
including AEs that resulted in death. Deaths were outcomes, not events. Progression of lymphoma was 
not recorded as an AE or SAE if it was clearly consistent with the suspected progression of the patient’s 
underlying  cancer.    Hospitalization  due  solely  to  the  progression  of  underlying  lymphoma  was  not 
reported as an SAE.   
All AEs (related and unrelated) were recorded up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug, Grade ≥ 
3 AEs (related and unrelated) were recorded up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug, Grade 3 
or  4  infections  (related  and  unrelated)  were  recorded  up  to  24  months  after  the  last  dose  of  study 
drug. 
All  grade  events  of  infusion  related  reactions  (IRRs),  neutropenia,  infections  (including  progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), thrombocytopenia (including acute 
thrombocytopenia  and  hemorrhagic  events),  gastrointestinal  (GI)  perforation,  cardiac  events,  second 
malignancies  and  hepatitis  B  reactivation  were  identified  as  AEPIs  (adverse  events  of  particular

interest). 
Safety Population 
The  safety  population  included  all  patients  who  received  any  amount  of  study  drug  (obinutuzumab, 
rituximab,  or  chemotherapy  [CHOP,  CVP,  or  bendamustine]).    The  FL  safety  population  consisted  of 
1192  patients:  597patients  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and  595  in  the  G-chemo  arm.    Of  1202  randomized 
patients with FL, 10 patients (four patients in the R-chemo arm and six patients in the G-chemo arm) 
did not receive any amount of study drug (obinutuzumab, rituximab, or chemotherapy [CHOP, CVP, or 
bendamustine])  and  therefore,  per  protocol,  were  excluded  from  the  FL  safety  population.  Three 
patients in the G-chemo arm received one or more doses of rituximab in error – these patients are also 
included in the G-chemo arm for safety analyses.

Patient exposure 
In Study BO21223, the median observation time (randomization to last available assessment) among 
FL  patients  at  the  cutoff  date  was  34.4  months  (range:  0.1  54.5  months)  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and 
34.8 months (range: 0.0  53.8 months) in the G-chemo arm. The median duration of post-treatment 
follow-up  at  the  cutoff  date  of  31  January  2016  was  9.2  months  (range:  0.042.3 months)  in  the 
R-chemo arm and 9.4 months (range: 0.046.9 months) in the G-chemo arm.   
Of  676 patients  with  previously  untreated 
FL 
treated  with  an  obinutuzumab-based 
chemoimmunotherapy  induction  regimen  in  the  two  studies,  620 patients  went  on  to  receive 
obinutuzumab maintenance for up to 2 years as monotherapy.

Adverse Events by Severity   
The  majority  of  AEs  reported  in  the  study  were  NCI  CTC  AE  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  in  each  arm 
(8022/9341 events [85.9%] in the R-chemo arm and 8767/10311 [85.0%] in the G chemo arm (see 
Table 16). 
The numbers of AEs that were Grade 3-5 (1,319 in the R-chemo arm and 1,544 in the R-chemo arm) 
were much lower than the numbers of Grade 1-2 AEs (see paragraph above). In the R-chemo arm vs. 
the  G-chemo  arm  of  the  study,  67.8%  of  patients  and  74.6%  of  patients,  respectively,  experienced 
Grade 3-5 AEs.  The percentages of patients with  FL  with  at least  one Grade  3-5  AE in the R-chemo 
arm  vs.  G-chemo  arm,  respectively,  were  36.2%  vs.  35.3%  Grade  3;  28.3%  vs.  35.3%  Grade  4 
(driven by a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia in the G-chemo arm (29.5% in the R-chemo arm 
vs. 36.6% in the G-chemo arm); and 3.4% vs. 4.0% Grade 5.

AE:  adverse event; NCI CTC = National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 
Multiple occurrences of the same AE in the same individual are counted in the total number of AEs. 
Adverse events of special interest 
A higher incidence  of AEs (all grades and  Grade  3-5)  in the G-chemo arm compared  to the R-chemo 
arm was observed for the following AEPIs:  IRRs, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections (no PML 
case  was  reported),  and  second  malignancies.    The  incidence  of  hemorrhagic  events  and 
gastrointestinal perforations were comparable between the study arms.

Prolonged neutropenia and late onset neutropenia 
Prolonged  neutropenia  was  defined  as  low  neutrophil  counts  at  the  last  visit  before  last  antibody 
administration (LAA) followed by an assessment of low neutrophil count between Day 24 and Day 41 
after LAA.  Prolonged neutropenia occurred  in 3/537  patients (0.6%) in  the R chemo  arm and 5/533 
patients (0.9%) in the G chemo arm.   
Late onset neutropenia (i.e., low neutrophil count at LAA with absolute neutrophil count within normal 
range at last previous visit prior to LAA) occurred in 22/537 patients (4.1%) in  the R chemo arm and 
21/533 patients (3.9%) in the G chemo arm.

Gastrointestinal perforation 
Gastrointestinal  perforation  was  reported  in  three  patients  (0.5%)  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and  in  four 
patients (0.7%) in the G-chemo arm. The events included fistulas in two patients in the R-chemo arm 
(one  of  whom  had  a  history  of  diverticulitis  and  intermittent  constipation  at  study  entry)  and  one 
patient in the G-chemo arm (with a history of sigmoiditis at study entry); each of these three patients 
had extranodal involvement at study entry.  
Cardiac events 
The incidence of cardiac AEs (SOC of “Cardiac Disorders”) was 9.7% in the R-chemo arm and 13.1% in 
the G-chemo arm.  The most frequently occurring cardiac events, for patients in the R-chemo and G-
chemo  arms,  respectively,  were  palpitations  (2.7%  vs.  2.5%),  tachycardia  (1.2%  vs.  2.7%),  atrial 
fibrillation (1.3% vs. 1.7%), sinus tachycardia (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and angina pectoris (0.8% vs. 0.7%).   
The  percentage  of  patients  with  Grade  3  to  5  cardiac  AEs  was  similar  in  the  two  arms:  2.8%  for  R-

chemo and 3.7% for G-chemo), with four patients in each arm experiencing Grade 4 events and two in 
each arm experiencing Grade 5 events. The fatal events were cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction 
in the R-chemo arm, and two cases of cardiogenic  shock in the G-chemo arm.  Each fatal cardiac AE 
occurred in elderly patients (  65 years old) with pre-existing conditions. 
Serious cardiac AEs were reported in 2.0 % of patients in the R-chemo arm and 4.4% in the G-chemo 
arm.  The  incidence  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  and  serious  AEs  in  patients  without  pre-existing  cardiac 
conditions was low and balanced between arms. 
Of the patients who experienced cardiac events, one patient in the R chemo arm (due to cardiac failure 
and  cardiogenic  shock)  and  two  patients  in  the  G  chemo  arm  (one  due  to  tachycardia  and  the  other 
due to ventricular dysfunction) had a study treatment withdrawn due to the event.  Ten patients in the 
R-chemo arm and 20 patients in the G-chemo arm had a dose interruption of any drug due to cardiac 
events.  Twenty-six patients in the R-chemo arm and 41 patients in the G-chemo arm had treatment 
for cardiac events, and the cardiac events had  resolved in most patients by the data cutoff date  (for 
41/58 patients in the R-chemo arm and 66/78 patients in the G-chemo arm).   
Some  of  the  patients  had  cardiac  events  that  occurred  during  or within  24  hours of  the  end  of  an 
infusion  and  were  therefore  considered  infusion-related  events  (10  patients  [1.7%]  who  experienced 
cardiac events in the R-chemo arm and 26 patients [4.4%] who experienced cardiac events in the G-
chemo  arm).    When  excluding  cardiac  AEs  reported  as  IRRs  (such  as  palpitations,  tachycardia,  and 
bradycardia  occurring  within  24  hours  of  infusion),  the  incidence  of  cardiac  AEs  was  comparable 
between arms: 8.2% of patients in the R-chemo arm vs. 9.6% in the G-chemo arm. 
Twenty-six patients in the R-chemo arm and 41 patients in the G-chemo arm had treatment for cardiac 
events,  and  the  cardiac  events  had  resolved  in  most  patients  by  the  data  cutoff  date  (for  41/58 
patients in the R-chemo arm and 66/78 patients in the G-chemo arm).    
There were four fatal cardiac AEs in total, two in each arm (cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction in 
the R-chemo arm, and two cases of cardiogenic shock in the G-chemo arm).  The fatal cardiac AEs in 
the G-chemo arm occurred in elderly patients (> 65 years old) with preexisting cardiac conditions.

arm had an event as compared to a 7.9% of the patients in the G-chemo arm. 
Hepatitis B Reactivation 
Overall, 53 patients in the R-chemo arm and 29 patients in the G-chemo arm were hepatitis B core 
antibody positive at baseline, and therefore at risk of developing hepatitis B reactivation. Five patients 
experienced AEs of HBV reactivation: two in the R-chemo arm and three in the G-chemo arm; all the 
events reported in the G-chemo arm were Grades 1 or 2.   
Patients could receive prophylactic anti-viral medication to prevent HBV reactivation in countries where 
they are administered as part of the standard of care or national guidelines.  Of the patients with 
hepatitis B core antibody positive at baseline, 15 in the R-chemo arm and 7 in the G-chemo arm 
received prophylaxis for hepatitis B on-study.  Of the 5 patients who experienced the AE PT of 
Hepatitis B reactivation, both patients in the R-chemo arm and one of the 3 patients in the G-chemo 
arm, received prophylaxis for hepatitis B.

Laboratory findings 
B-cell depletion and recovery 
Almost  all  patients  who  had  a  B-cell  result  reported  showed  B-cell  depletion  at  the  last  antibody 
administration. Of the 452 patients in the R-chemo arm with a B-cell result, 445 patients showed B-cell 
depletion at the LAA.  Of the 457 patients in the G chemo arm with a B-cell result, 454 patients had B-
cell depletion at the LAA. 
Immunoglobulin  depletion  was defined as levels below 0.5 g/L, 5.0 g/L  and 0.3 g/L  for IgA, IgG and 
IgM,  respectively,  at  any  time  during  the  study.    The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing 
immunoglobulin depletion at the last dose of antibody was: 
• 
• 
• 
IgA: 9.5% in the R-chemo arm and 6.4% in the G-chemo arm. 
IgG: 11.6% in the R-chemo arm and 9.4% in the G-chemo arm 
IgM: 29.0% in the R-chemo arm and 29.7% in the G-chemo arm 
Immunoglobulin  depletion  was  comparable  between  the  treatment  arms.  At  the  time  of  data  cutoff, 
only  a  few  patients  (3.4  –  10.7%)  with  immunoglobulin  depletion  had  recovered,  hence  the  time  to 
recovery could not be calculated in a meaningful way.

Chemistry 
The  highest  NCI-CTCAE  Grade  for  chemistry  parameters  throughout  the  study  is  shown  in  Table  41 
(also  see  Section  8.12.12.2  in  primary  BO21223  CSR).    Grade  3  and/or  Grade  4  abnormalities  were 
reported  for  the  following  chemistry  parameters  on  both  treatment  arms  during  the  study:    albumin 
(low), ALT (high), AST (high), calcium (low and high), CrCL (low), BSA corrected CrCL (low), creatinine 
(high  and  low),  potassium  (low  and  high),  sodium  (low),  bilirubin  (high),  and  uric  acid  (high).    High 
uric acid (any grade and Grade 3, in particular) was more frequently (≥ 5% difference) reported in the 
G-chemo  arm.  Abnormalities  of  the  following  parameters  were  also  more  frequently  reported  (≥  5% 
difference)  in  the  G-chemo  arm:  low  albumin,  high  ALT,  high  AST,  low  calcium,  high  potassium  and 
low sodium. 
Anti-therapeutic antibodies 
The detection of human anti-human (HAHA) anti-drug antibodies against obinutuzumab was performed 
using a validated ELISA.  The sensitivity of the method was 18.4 ng-equiv./mL antibody titer in human 
serum.  For  the  positive  control,  a  purified  rabbit  polyclonal  antibody  directed  against  obinutuzumab 
was used.  The mean drug tolerance factor was 95.6 (the tolerated ratio of drug to positive control), 
allowing  the  detection  of  anti-obinutuzumab  antibodies  with  a  sensitivity  level  of  0.500  µg/mL  at 
obinutuzumab serum concentrations of up to 47.8 ≥g/mL. 
Immunogenicity  testing  of  study  samples  in  the  G  chemo  arm  was  performed  using  a  3  tiered 
approach  (screening,  confirmation,  and  titration).    The  confirmatory  assay  was  statistically  evaluated 
during  validation  to  allow  for  the  presence  of  approximately  1%  false  positive  results.    For  samples 
confirmed  positive,  titration  was  performed  and  an  antibody  titer  value  was  reported.    The  titer  was 
defined as the highest sample dilution that resulted in a response at or above the assay cut point. 
At baseline, 25 patients (5.1%) in the G chemo arm had positive HAHA results.  As these patients had 
not been exposed to obinutuzumab before, these results can be regarded as false positive. One patient 
in the G chemo arm had a detectable positive HAHA result for anti obinutuzumab antibodies after Cycle 
1, Day 1.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No  dose  reductions  were  permitted  for  obinutuzumab  in  either  study  (nor  for  rituximab  in  Study 
BO21223).  Certain  AEs  warranted  slowing  of  antibody  infusion  rate,  interruptions,  or  dose  delays.  
Chemotherapy  regimen  modifications  included  dose  delays  and  reduction  of  certain  chemotherapy 
components under certain circumstances. 
A  patient  was  considered  to  have  withdrawn  from  study  treatment  if  they  discontinued  all  of  the 
components of their allocated treatment.  
Post marketing experience 
There is currently no Post Marketing Experience with obinutuzumab in this indication. No new safety 
concerns have been identified since the last RMP was submitted. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The size of the safety database with approximately 600 patients exposed to obinutuzumab in both the 
induction phase and the maintenance phase is acceptable. Demographic and patient characteristics 
were balanced between the treatment arms. 
Dose intensity and duration of treatment was overall comparable between treatment arms in both 
induction and maintenance phase. During induction, most patients received all planned doses of 
obinutuzumab or rituximab. Overall, 99.5% of patients in the R-chemo arm and 99.7% of patients in 
the G-chemo arm received at least 90% of the planned cumulative dose of therapeutic antibody. 
In the FL population of Study BO21223, the treatment arms were generally well-balanced with respect 
to demographic factors.  The median age of patients was 59.0 years (range: 23 to 88 years) and very 
similar in each study arm.  The majority of patients were less than 65 years of age (68.7%).   Overall, 
more  female  than  male  patients  were  randomized  in  the  study  (53.2%  female).    The  majority  of 
patients were White (80.5%).  The median BSA was 1.84 m2 and the median BMI was 25.69 kg/ m2, 
and these characteristics were also very similar in both treatment arms.

Baseline disease characteristics including B-symptom data, bone marrow involvement, FLIPI scores 
and other parameters, were also balanced overall between the two arms of the study. The treatment 
arms were well balanced with regard to the baseline stratification factors: FLIPI (low, intermediate and 
high), chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, bendamustine) and geographic region (Eastern Europe, 
Western Europe, North America, Asia, Other).  AEs and SAEs were defined according to acceptable 
standards. The causal relationship of AEs to the investigational products was assessed by 
investigators. Deaths were outcomes, not events, and progression of lymphoma was not recorded as 
AEs or SAEs. 
In the G-chemo arm, only four patients missed either the Cycle1 Day 8, or Cycle 1 Day 15 dose (note, 
the other 11 patients in this listing were withdrawn from treatment after Cycle 1 Day 1 so only 
received one dose of study medication in total). 
During maintenance, most patients received all planned doses of obinutuzumab or rituximab. Overall, 
99.2%  of  patients  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and  99.8%  of  patients  in  the  G-chemo  arm  received  at  least 
90% of the planned cumulative dose of therapeutic antibody. The median duration  of treatment  with 
rituximab and obinutuzumab during maintenance was the same in the two arms (92 weeks). 
Overall, AEs are more frequently observed in the G-chemo arm. This is not unexpected and is in line 
with  the  previous  findings  in  studies  with  obinutuzumab.  However,  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal of study treatment is considered similar. Thus, even though AEs  occur more frequently in 
the G-chemo, patients seem to adhere to treatment. Looking at AEs with an incidence rate of at least 
10%,  the  most  relevant  differences  are  seen  with  regard  to  neutropenia,  diarrhoea,  pyrexia  and 
infusion related reactions (IRR). These are all well-known AEs related to anti-CD20 antibodies and are 
adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Looking  at  the  AEs  reported  with  a difference  of  at  least  2%,  it is 
observed  that  the  difference  in  neutropenia  does  not  translate  into  a  relevant  difference  in  terms 
febrile  neutropenia.  Differences  are  observed  with  regard  to  other  AEs,  but  none  are  considered 
clinically significant and the majority of these AEs are adequately handled in the clinical setting.  
More  AEs  occurred  during  induction  phase,  where  the  majority  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  observed. 
During both induction, maintenance and follow-up, more AEs occurred in the G-chemo arm. This is as 
expected and do not pose any major clinical concerns or challenges.   
There are no relevant difference between the two treatment arms in terms of Grade 1-3 and 5 AEs was 
reported, however, a significant difference is observed in Grade 4 AEs. The updated data  as of clinical 
cutoff  of  10  September  2016  showed  consistency  between  these  data  and  the  primary  analysis  data 
concerning  the  AEs,  SAEs,  fatal  AEs,  and  resolved  AEs.  A  difference  less  than  2%  was  reported  in 
either sex compared with the overall FL patient population.  
No  significant  difference  in  safety  between  the  two  treatment  arms  was  observed  related  to  gender. 
With  regard  to  age,  there  seems  to  be  more  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  and  death  in  patients 
>=65 years, which was expected. 
With regard to adverse events of particular/special interest IRR, a well-known AE related to anti-CD20 
antibodies,  is  more  frequently  observed  in  patients  treated  with  obinutuzumab,  especially  during  the 
first  couple  of  cycles  of  treatment.  Most  of  the  IRR  resolved  with  either  treatment  modifications  or 
spontaneously.  IRR  is  well  described  in  the  SmPC,  were  precautionary  measures  in  terms  of 
premedication are given.  
Neutropenia was another adverse event of particular/special interest; slightly more Grade 3 and 4 AEs 
are observed in the G-chemo arm. This is not unexpected. No Grade 5 AEs are observed. Neutropenia 
in itself is not a major concerns, however, prolonged neutropenia give rise to more infections. Overall, 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 96/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more infections and Grade 3-5 infections were reported in the G-chemo arm compared to the R-chemo 
arm.  The incidence of Grade 3-5 infections was lower among G-chemo patients who received G-CSF 
prophylaxis compared with those who did not. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) could be 
considered  in  patients  who  experience  neutropenia.The  incidence  and  rate  of  infection  is  higher  for 
obinutuzumab  compared  to  rituximab,  also  in  the  maintenance  phase.  This  could  be  related  to 
prolonged  B-cell  depletion  and  longer  recovery.  Patients  that  received  bendamustine  seems  to  be  at 
higher risk. Updated B-cell assessments as of data cutoff of 10-september-2016 are still immature and 
no  conclusion  can  be  drawn.  B-cell  depletion  and  recovery  data  will  be  submitted  in  the  final  clinical 
study report.  
Serious cardiac AEs were reported in 2.0 % of patients in the R-chemo arm and 4.4% in the G-chemo 
arm;  the  imbalance  between  the  arms  was  largely  due  to  more  reports  of  atrial  fibrillation, 
bradycardia,  and  acute  myocardial  infarction  (mostly  in  elderly  patients  with  previous  or  concurrent 
coronary disease) in the G-chemo arm.  
When IRRs were excluded the difference in the incidence of cardiac events was reduced. The number 
of  cardiac  Grade  3-5  and  serious  AEs  in  patients  without  cardiac  conditions  was  low  and  balanced 
between  arms.  Overall,  the  risk  of  cardiac  events  in  patients  with  pre-existing  conditions  is  notable, 
and  these  patients  should  be  monitored  closely  if  treated  with  obinutuzumab.  This  is  adequately 
reflected  in  the  SmPC.  The  updated  cardiac  AEs  were  similar  to  the  first  analysis.  The  numbers  are 
small and overall a similar proportion of patients had cardiac grade 3-5 events in both treatment arms 
when  cardiac  IRRs  were  excluded.  Most  patients  in  the  R-chemo  and  G-chemo  arms  with  grade  3-5 
cardiac  events  had  predisposing  factors,  hypertension  being  the  most  frequent,  other  factors  were 
diabetes  and  pre-existing  cardiac  conditions.  The  4  fatal  events  were  in  patients  who  received 
bendamustine  during  induction. Patients who  receive  bendamustine  are  often more frail compared to 
those who receive CHOP. The cardiac events are adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
With regard to secondary  malignancies,  there  are  slightly more events in the G-chemo arm,  6.0% in 
the R-chemo arm and 7.9% in the G-chemo arm comparable to the proportion observed in the primary 
analysis.    Although,  no  apparent  pattern  can  be  observed,  hematological  malignancies  were  only 
observed  in  the  G-chemo  arm.  The  number  for  each  different  cancer  is  small,    it  could  be  chance 
findings  and  was  driven  mainly  by  a  difference  in  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  and  hematological 
malignancies.  Cytogenetic  tests  performed  in  patients  with  secondary  AML/MDS,  however  were 
inconclusive as to whether the cases were treatment related or de novo. 
With  regard  to  other  adverse  events  of  particular/special  interest  (thrombocytopenia,  TLS,  GI 
perforation) no clinically relevant differences were observed.  
There  was  a  higher  rate  of  thrombocytopenia  in  the  G-chemo  arm  compared  to  the  R-chemo  arm, 
especially in cycle 1, but the incidence of hemorrhage was low. Patients should be carefully monitored 
as  addressed  in  the  SmPC.  Concomitant  treatment  with  agents  like  platelet  inhibitors  and 
anticoagulants  could  increase  the  risk.    Thrombocytopenia  was  only  seen  in  few  patients  in  the 
maintenance phase.  This AE is known with Gazyvaro. 
The  risk  of  TLS  is  already  flagged  in  the  FL  population.  Patients  considered  at  risk  should  receive 
prophylaxis. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Hepatitis  B  reactivation  is  a  known  risk  of  anti-CD20  antibodies.  The  numbers  are  small,  but  seems 
comparable  between  the  treatment  groups.  Screening  should  be  performed  and  local  guidelines 
followed. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC. No case of PML was observed. 
The above findings are also reflected in the pattern of SAEs and Grade 3-5 AEs, where more are seen 
in the G-chemo arm, mainly driven by infections, neutropenia, IRR and thrombocytopenia. Overall, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 97/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher toxicity of obinutuzumab compared  to rituximab is as expected from the mechanism of action 
and seems manageable.  
Updated  data  with  regard  to  secondary  malignancies,  showed  slightly  more  events  in  the  G-chemo 
arm:  6.0%  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and  7.9%  in  the  G-chemo  arm.  Hematological  malignancies 
malignancies  (Hodgkin  disease,  acute  myeloid 
leukemia,  acute 
lymphocytic 
leukemia  and 
myelodysplastic syndromes) were only observed in the G-chemo arm.  Although no clear pattern in the 
type  of  tumor  and  the  onset,  latency,  or  chemotherapy  regimen,  in  either  treatment  arm  was 
observed,  the  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  a  difference  in  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  and 
hematological  malignancies.  Cytogenetic  tests  performed  in  patients  with  secondary  AML/MDS, 
however were inconclusive as to whether the cases were treatment related or de novo. 
The frequency of death was similar in the R-chemo and G-chemo arm, (3.4% vs. 4.0%, respectively).  
The causes  of death  due to adverse events are overall as expected and with no apparent differences 
between treatment arms. However, the number of deaths and number of AEs with fatal outcome in the 
R-Benda  and  G-Benda  arm  are  high  compared  to  the  other  chemo  backbones.  This  is  in  contrast  to 
common clinical understanding of the safety profile of bendamustine, which is considered to be more 
tolerable  than  CHOP  and  CVP.  The  updated  analysis  as  of  clinical  cutoff  date  10  september  2016 
revealed  1  more  patient  in  the  R-benda  subgroup  with  a  fatal  outcome.    Although  small  numbers, 
more  patients  in  the  R-benda  and  G-benda  subgroup  were  confounded  by  older  age  >  80  years, 
baseline  comorbidity  and/or  new  anti-lymphoma  treatment  than  patients  in  the  CHOP  subgroups.  
Thus no specific cause could be identified which could explain the higher incidence of fatal AEs  in the 
G-benda  (5.9%)and  R-benda  (4.4%)  subgroup,  when  compared  to  patients  who  received  CVP-  and 
CHOP–containing regimens (range of 1.6% to 2.0%). 
No concerns regarding anti-drug antibodies were identified. 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with obinutuzumab. This is acceptable as 
such  interactions  are  not  expected  with  this  monoclonal  antibody.  A  comparison  of  serum 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  from  studies  of  obinutuzumab  monotherapy  with  pharmacokinetic 
parameters from studies of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (BO21000) suggests that 
concomitant chemotherapy has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab. 
Delayed reporting of AEs was reported, however this was widely spread and not confined to specific 
sites with no trends detected. Updated safety data as of the 5th May 2017 showed an increase of 
adverse events between the snapshot dates 29 April 2016 and 5 May 2017 by 8.3 % and 7.9 % in the 
R-chemo arm and G-chemo arm respectively. The number of patients with any AE (all grades), Grade 
3-5 AEs, Fatal AEs, SAEs or AE leading to withdrawal from any treatment was only slightly affected and 
did not differ between the treatments.  The updated safety data did not cause a difference between 
treatment arms of ≥ 2 %. An increase in number of patients experiencing a Grade 3-5 AE of 2.2 % in 
the R-chemo arm and 2.0 % in the G-chemo arm was mainly driven by neutropenia. The incidence of 
neutropenia is highest in the G-chemo arm.  No differences between treatment arms was identified by 
AE grade, nature or severity. The incidence by treatment phase and by chemotherapy was also 
unaffected by the safety update. The small numerical differences in incidences caused by the safety 
update did not change the overall safety profile of either treatment and no concerning changes in 
incidences between treatments has been identified. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics and section 4.8 has been updated accordingly.

The final report from study BO21223 as foreseen in the RMP- focus on safety updates; events of 
thrombocytopenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia, prolonged B-cell depletion, immunogenicity, 
will be specifically investigated. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety of the combination of obinutuzumab with chemotherapy is acceptable and as 
expected. There are more AEs and SAEs, but the withdrawal rates are comparable between the two 
treatment arms, thus, indicating that patients adhered to treatment. The observed toxicities are 
manageable in clinical practice.

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
  Within this procedure, the MAH has submitted an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP version 
3.0) and based on the latest approved RMP (version 2.2), including data from the pivotal study 
BO21223/GALLIUM in previously untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphoma as well 
as data from the supportive study BO21000/GAUDI. 
In addition, the MAH proposed to update the due date for the final clinical study report of study 
BO21223/GALLIUM listed in the Gazyvaro Risk Management Plan "Category 3: Required 
additional pharmacovigilance activities”. 
The PRAC considered the risk management plan version 3.1 to be acceptable. The PRAC 
endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment reports are attached.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 3.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which 
were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
  No  significant  changes  impacting  the  readability  of  the  package  leaflet  are  made.  The  new 
additions follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the 
approved package leaflet. 
 
The  target  group  of  users  has  not  fundamentally  changed:  the  age  range  of  patients  with 
previously untreated follicular lymphoma is similar to the age range of participants interviewed 
during  the  Gazyvaro  user  test.  Gazyvaro  is  already  approved  in  the  follicular  lymphoma 
setting. 
  Moreover,  posology  proposed  in  this  application  does  not  essentially  differ  to  the  currently 
approved follicular lymphoma indication.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
This  is  a  type  II  variation  to  extend  the  indication  of  GAZYVARO  in  combination  with  chemotherapy, 
followed  by  Gazyvaro  maintenance  therapy  in  patients  achieving  a  response,  for  the  treatment  of 
patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma. 
The  MAH  has  provided  the  interim  results  of  one  pivotal,  randomized,  open-label,  Phase  III  study 
BO21223 (GALLIUM) in patients with previously untreated advanced indolent non –Hodgkin lymphoma 
NHL.  Obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  significantly  decreases  the  risk  of  relapse 
compared to R-chemo with HR for PFS at 0.66, p-value 0.0012. In a disease characterized by several 
relapses,  where  the  patient  finally  becomes  refractory  to  the  different  chemotherapy  agents,  this  is 
clinically highly relevant,  as time-to relapse  is further  postponed.  Secondary  endpoints, such as EFS, 
DOR and TTNALT are consistent with the primary endpoint and show a benefit in favour of G-chemo. 
With  regard  to  DFS,  as  expected  in  a  disease  entity  with  a  relatively  long  survival,  data  are  not 
mature, but there is no indication of any detrimental effect. 
The median PFS by INV was not reached in any arm at the time of analysis. Due to the course of FL, 
median PFS may take considerable long time to reach. An updated analysis after 6.6 months additional 
median follow-up with a data cut-off of 10 September 2016 was performed. The investigator-assessed 
PFS  increased  to  281/370  =  76%  of  total  planned  events  with  a  HR  of  0.68  (95%  CI:  0.54,  0.87), 
p=0.0016,  being  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  The  HR  estimate  for  secondary  time–to-event 
endpoints  are  consistent with  data  from  the  primary  analysis.  OS  data  were  also  consistent  with  the 
primary  analysis,  showing  no  significant  effect  of  G-chemo  as  compared  to  R-chemo.  A  PFS  blinded 
assessment  was  performed  by  an  Independent  review  committee  (IRC)  in  order  to  support  primary 
outcomes  resulting  in  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.71  -  in  the  range  of  the  expected  reduction  risk  in  FL 
population,  but  not  statistically  significant  in  regard  to  the  type-1  error  set  in  the  trial  for  the  3rd 
interim  analysis  (0.012).    The  concordance  rate  between  the  two  analyses  is  considered  acceptable 
and in line with what has previously been accepted. The study was stopped for efficacy based on IDMC 
recommendations as planned and described in the protocol.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There seems to be no difference between G-chemo and R-chemo in patients with FLIPI score low, but 
patients with FLIPI score low only comprised 21% of the ITT population and no explanation could be 
found as to why obinutuzumab had no added effect in the FLIPI low score subgroup. This information 
was reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
There are no data on the activity of Gazyvaro in Follicular Lymphoma grade 3b patients. These patients 
were excluded from the clinical studies GALLIUM and GOYA, (see SmPC section 5.1) as in clinical 
practice they are more aggressively treated, similar to DLBCL. Data from DLBCL patients from the 
GOYA trial indicated similar activity for Gazyvaro and Rituximab in patients with DLBCL.  
Update on the overall survival data (still immature at the time of the updated analysis) will be provided 
with the final report from Study BO21223 (see RMP).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, AEs are more frequently observed in the G-chemo arm. This is not unexpected and is in line 
Assessment report  
EMA/538285/2017  
Page 104/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with  the  previous  findings  in  studies  with  obinutuzumab.  However,  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal of study treatment is considered similar.  Thus, even  though AEs  occur more  frequently in 
the G-chemo, patients seem to adhere to treatment. Looking at AEs with an incidence rate of at least 
10%,  the  most  relevant  differences  are  seen  with  regard  to  neutropenia,  diarrhoea,  pyrexia  and 
infusion related reactions (IRR). These are all well-known AEs related to anti-CD20 antibodies and are 
adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
More  AEs  occurred  during  induction  phase,  where  the  majority  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  observed. 
During both induction, maintenance and follow-up, more AEs occurred in the G-chemo arm. This is as 
expected and do not pose any major clinical concerns or challenges.   
Slightly  more  Grade  3  and  4  AEs  are  observed  in  the  G-chemo  arm.  This  is  not  unexpected. 
Neutropenia  in  itself  is  not  a  major  concerns,  however,  prolonged  neutropenia  give  rise  to  more 
infections.  Overall,  more  infections  and  Grade  3-5  infections  were  reported  in  the  G-chemo  arm 
compared  to  the  R-chemo  arm.    The  incidence  of  Grade  3-5  infections  was  lower  among  G-chemo 
patients who received G-CSF prophylaxis compared with  those  who did  not. Thus  Granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factors (G-CSF) could be considered in patients who experience neutropenia. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Considering that the results from the subgroup analysis in FLIPI low patients are currently 
inconclusive, section 4.4 of the SmPC was amended to include a recommendation that the therapy 
choice in these patients should take into account the overall safety profile of obinutuzumab plus 
chemotherapy and the patient situation. Final report from Study BO21223 will provide more 
information on adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia, 
prolonged B-cell depletion and immunogenicity (see RMP). 
Subgroup  analyses  of  outcome  by  chemotherapy  backbone  showed  that  the  number  of  deaths  and 
number of AEs with fatal outcome in the R-Benda and G-Benda arm are higher compared to the other 
chemo  backbones. Although  small  numbers,  patients  in  the  R-benda  and  G-benda  subgroup  were  of 
older age > 80 years  and had  more  baseline comorbidity and/or  new  anti-lymphoma treatment  than 
patients in the CHOP subgroups.  No specific cause could be identified which could explain the higher 
incidence  of  fatal  AEs   in  the  G-benda  (5.9%)and  R-benda  (4.4%)  subgroup,  when  compared  to 
patients  who  received  CVP-  and  CHOP–containing  regimens  (range  of  1.6%  to  2.0%).  Final  study 
report is expected to provide mature data (see RMP).

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The PFS gain is considered clinically meaningful for patients with FL with HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54, 
0.87), p=0.0016 from the updated analysis - consistent with the primary analysis (HR = 0.66 [95% 
CI: 0.51, 0.85]).  Overall survival data are as expected immature at this stage, but will be updated at 
the final CSR. 
There  are  no  new  safety  findings  and  the  observed  toxicities  are  overall  manageable  in  the  clinical 
setting.  However,  the  adverse  event  profile  of  obinutuzumab  including  uncertainties  (i.e.  risk  of 
secondary malignancies) is in line with well-known so far safety in CLL.   
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Data  to  support  the  efficacy  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  patients  with 
previously untreated FL are provided from one pivotal Phase III study (study BO21223/GALLIUM), with 
additional data from the supporting study BO21000 (GAUDI). Study BO21223, showed that treatment 
with obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful  reduction  in  the  risk  of  progression  or  death  as  assessed  by  the  investigator,  compared

with  rituximab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  The  results  of  the  primary  endpoint  are  further 
supported by the key secondary endpoint, PFS by IRC. Due to the course of FL, median PFS may take 
considerable  long  time  to  reach,  however  the  difference  in  PFS  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in 
patients  with  FL,  favoring  obinutuzumab  +chemo  followed  by  obinutuzumab  maintenance  is 
statistically  significant  and  clinically  important  and  seems  robust.    Results  from  secondary  endpoints 
are  consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint.  OS  data  in  the  updated  analysis  were  also  consistent  with 
the  primary  analysis,  showing  no  difference  in  the  effect  of  G-chemo  as  compared  to  R-chemo.  The 
Applicant  will  provide  updated  efficacy  data  including  OS  data  at  the  time  of  the  final  analysis  post 
authorisation.  
Obinutuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  induction  followed  by  obinutuzumab  maintenance  in  patients  with 
previously-untreated  FL  was  associated  with  a  tolerable  and  manageable  safety  profile.  Overall,  no 
unexpected safety signals were detected in study BO21223 or study BO21000.   
The final study report from the pivotal study will be provided.

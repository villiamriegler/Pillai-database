CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults (see section 5.1).
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents (see section 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be initiated by a physician experienced in the 
management of HIV infection.
Posology
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg: One tablet, once daily.
Separate preparations of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are available for treatment of HIV-1 
infection if it becomes necessary to discontinue or modify the dose of one of the components of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.. Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
for these medicinal products.
If a dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is missed within 12 hours of the time it is 
usually taken, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be taken as soon as possible and 
the normal dosing schedule should be resumed. If a dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka 
d.d. is missed by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for the next dose, the missed dose should 
not be taken and the usual dosing schedule should be resumed.
If vomiting occurs within 1 hour of taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., another tablet 
should be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 1 hour after taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
2
Krka d.d. a second dose should not be taken.
Special populations
Elderly: No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: Emtricitabine and tenofovir are eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to 
emtricitabine and tenofovir increases in individuals with renal dysfunction (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Adults with renal impairment:
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should only be used in individuals with creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) <80 mL/min if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. 
See Table 1.
Table 1: Dosing recommendations in adults with renal impairment
Mild renal impairment
(CrCl 50-80 mL/min) 
Moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-
49 mL/min) 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection
Limited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing (see 
section 4.4). 
Administration every 48 hours is recommended based on modelling 
of single-dose pharmacokinetic data for emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil in non-HIV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal 
impairment (see section 4.4). 
Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30
mL/min) and haemodialysis patients 
Not recommended because appropriate dose reductions cannot be 
achieved with the combination tablet. 
Paediatrics with renal impairment:
Not recommended for use in individuals under the age of 18 years with renal impairment (see section 
4.4).
Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 
4.4 and 5.2).
Paediatric population:
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 12 years 
have not been established (see section 5.2).
Method of administration
Oral administration. It is preferable that Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is taken with 
food.
The film-coated tablet can be disintegrated in approximately 100 mL of water, orange juice or grape 
juice and taken immediately.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients 
with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation (see section 5.1).
Patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection
3
HIV-1 infected patients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an 
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Physicians should refer to 
current HIV treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary 
of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. See also under Use with ledipasvir and 
sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir below.
Tenofovir disoproxil is indicated for the treatment of HBV and emtricitabine has shown activity 
against HBV in pharmacodynamic studies but the safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil have not been specifically established in patients with chronic HBV infection.
Discontinuation of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. therapy in patients infected with 
HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients infected with HBV who 
discontinue Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be closely monitored with both 
clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, 
resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In patients with advanced liver disease or 
cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis 
may lead to hepatic decompensation.
Liver disease
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been established in patients with 
significant underlying liver disorders. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir has been studied in patients 
with hepatic impairment and no dose adjustment is required. The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine 
has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on minimal hepatic metabolism and 
the renal route of elimination for emtricitabine, it is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required 
for Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2).
HIV-1infected patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an 
increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) 
and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease 
in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
Renal and bone effects in adults
Renal effects
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular 
filtration and active tubular secretion. Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, 
hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with 
the use of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.8).
Renal monitoring
Prior to initiating Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, it 
is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all individuals.
In individuals without risk factors for renal disease, it is recommended that renal function (creatinine 
clearance and serum phosphate) is monitored after two to four weeks of use, after three months of use 
and every three to six months thereafter.
In individuals at risk for renal disease more frequent monitoring of renal function is required.
See also under Co-administration of other medicinal products below.

Renal management in HIV-1 infected patients
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dL (0.48 mmol/L) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 mL/min 
in any patient receiving Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., renal function should be re-
evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine 
glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration should be given to 
interrupting treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. in patients with creatinine 
clearance decreased to < 50 mL/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L). 
Interrupting treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should also be considered in 
case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified.
Renal safety with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in 
HIV-1 infected patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min). Dose 
interval adjustments are recommended for HIV-1 infected patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 
mL/min (see section 4.2). Limited clinical study data suggest that the prolonged dose interval is not 
optimal and could result in increased toxicity and possibly inadequate response. Furthermore, in a 
small clinical study, a subgroup of patients with creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 mL/min who 
received tenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine every 24 hours had a 2-4-fold higher 
exposure to tenofovir and worsening of renal function (see section 5.2). Therefore, a careful benefit-
risk assessment is needed when Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is used in patients with 
creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, and renal function should be closely monitored. In addition, the 
clinical response to treatment should be closely monitored in patients receiving 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. at a prolonged dosing interval. The use of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and in patients who require haemodialysis since 
appropriate dose reductions cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Bone effects
Bone abnormalities such as osteomalacia which can manifest as persistent or worsening bone pain, 
and which can infrequently contribute to fractures, may be associated with tenofovir disoproxil-
induced proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8).
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD).
If bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained.
Treatment of HIV-1 infection
In a 144-week controlled clinical study (GS-99-903) that compared tenofovir disoproxil with 
stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small 
decreases in BMD of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in BMD of 
spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly greater in this 
group until 96 weeks. However, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically 
relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks in this study.
In other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen 
in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease 
inhibitor. Overall in view of the bone abnormalities associated with tenofovir disoproxil and the 
limitations of long term data on the impact of tenofovir disoproxil on bone health and fracture risk,
alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are at a high 
risk for fractures.
Renal and bone effects in the paediatric population
There are uncertainties associated with the long-term renal and bone effects of tenofovir 
disoproxilduring the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population. Moreover, the 
reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.
5
A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to weigh the benefit/risk balance of the use of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for 
treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for supplementation on a case by case basis.
Renal effects
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV 1 
infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see sections 4.8 
and 5.1).
Renal monitoring
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to treatment, and 
should be monitored during use as in adults (see above).
Renal management
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, 
including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see 
section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation 
with a nephrologist should be obtained to consider interruption of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil
use. Interrupting use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should also be considered in case 
of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified.
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see Co-administration of other medicinal products 
below).
Renal impairment
The use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not recommended in individuals under the 
age 18 years with renal impairment (see section 4.2). Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued in 
paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
use.
Bone effects
Use of tenofovir disoproxil may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil -
associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown 
(see section 5.1).
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected during use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in any
paediatric patient, consultation with an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained.
Weight and metabolic parameters
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these 
have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders 
6
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be 
considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical 
findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current 
national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV.
Immune Reactivation Syndrome
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Opportunistic infections
HIV-1 infected patients receiving Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. or any other 
antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of 
HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced 
in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases.
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Co-administration of other medicinal products
Use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be avoided with concurrent or recent use 
of a nephrotoxic medicinal product (see section 4.5). If concomitant use with nephrotoxic agents is 
unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly.
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and 
with risk factors for renal dysfunction. If Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is co-
administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.
A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. Close monitoring of 
renal function is required in these patients (see section 4.5). In HIV-1 infected patients with renal risk 
factors, the co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be 
carefully evaluated.
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should not be administered concomitantly with other 
medicinal products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or other 
cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.5). Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil.
7
Use with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and 
voxilaprevir
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, 
especially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil when co-administered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir,
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not 
been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration should be 
considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with 
tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions 
related to tenofovir disoproxil.
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine:
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Triple nucleoside therapy
There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early 
stage in HIV-1 infected patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and 
abacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. There is close structural 
similarity between lamivudine and emtricitabine and similarities in the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of these two agents. Therefore, the same problems may be seen if 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is administered with a third nucleoside analogue.
Elderly
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in individuals over the age of 65 years. 
Individuals over the age of 65 years are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution 
should be exercised when administering Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. to older people.
Lactose
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare 
hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose 
malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Sodium
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, 
that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
As Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. contains emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any 
interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
The steady-state pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir were unaffected when emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil were administered together versus each medicinal product dosed alone.
In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP450 
mediated interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products 
8
is low.
Concomitant use not recommended
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should not be administered concomitantly with other 
medicinal products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or other 
cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.4). Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil.
Didanosine: The co-administration of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. and didanosine is 
not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 2).
Renally eliminated medicinal products: Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by 
the kidneys, co-administration of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with medicinal 
products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may 
increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal 
products.
Use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be avoided with concurrent or recent use 
of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, 
amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see 
section 4.4).
Other interactions
Interactions between emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or its individual component(s) and other 
medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change 
as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.” and once daily as “q.d.”). If available, 90% confidence intervals are

Co-administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine results 
in a 40-60% increase in systemic 
exposure to didanosine.
Co-administration of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. and didanosine is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Increased systemic exposure to 
didanosine may increase didanosine 
related adverse reactions. Rarely, 
pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, 
sometimes fatal, have been reported.
Co-administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 
400 mg daily has been associated with a 
significant decrease in CD4 cell count, 
possibly due to an intracellular 
interaction increasing phosphorylated 
(i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased 
dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-
administered with tenofovir disoproxil 
therapy has been associated with 
reports of high rates of virological 
failure within several tested 
combinations for the treatment of HIV-
1 infection.

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
17
Pregnancy
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1 000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil.
Animal studies on emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Therefore the use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. may be considered 
during pregnancy, if necessary.
Breast-feeding
Emtricitabine and tenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is insufficient 
information on the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants. Therefore 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should not be used during breast-feeding.
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil are available. Animal studies do not 
indicate harmful effects of emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
individuals should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with both 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to 
emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil were nausea (12%) and diarrhoea (7%) in an open-label 
randomised clinical study in adults (GS-01-934, see section 5.1). The safety profile of emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil in this study was consistent with the previous experience with these agents 
when each was administered with other antiretroviral agents.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with the tenofovir disoproxil 
and emtricitabine from clinical study and post-marketing experience in HIV-1 infected patients are 
listed in Table 3, below, by body system organ class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, 
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10 000 
to < 1/1 000).

2 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was 
administered to paediatric patients.
3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical 
studies in adults or paediatric HIV clinical studies for emtricitabine or in randomised controlled clinical studies or the 
tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program for tenofovir disoproxil. The frequency category was estimated from a 
statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical studies 
(n = 1,563) or tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical studies and the expanded access program (n = 7,319).
Description of selected adverse reactions
Renal impairment: As Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. may cause renal damage 
monitoring of renal function is recommended (see section 4.4). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally 
resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. However, in some HIV-1 infected 
patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil 
discontinuation. Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, 
advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased 
risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation 
(see section 4.4).
Lactic acidosis: Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in 
combination with other antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with 
decompensated liver disease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic 
acidosis are at increased risk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil 
treatment, including fatal outcomes.
Metabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during 
antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time 
of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections 
may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been 
reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many 
months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally 
acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of 
this is unknown (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population
Assessment of adverse reactions related to emtricitabine is based on experience in three paediatric 
studies (n = 169) where treatment-naïve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced (n = 46) paediatric HIV 
infected patients aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in combination with other 
antiretroviral agents. In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin 
discolouration (31.8%) occurred more frequently in clinical trials in paediatric patients than in adults 
(see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse reactions).
Assessment of adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil is based on two randomised trials 
(studies GS-US-104-0321 and GS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV 1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to 
< 18 years) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n 
= 91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1). The adverse 
reactions observed in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were 
consistent with those observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1).
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In HIV 1 infected adolescents (aged 12 
to < 18 years), the BMD Z scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower 
20
than those observed in subjects who received placebo. In HIV 1 infected children (aged 2 to 15 years), 
the BMD Z scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those 
observed in subjects who remained on their stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1).
In study GS-US-104-0352, 89 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients with a median age of 7 years (range 
2 to 15 years) were exposed to tenofovir disoproxil for a median of 331 weeks. Eight of the 89 patients
(9.0%) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events. Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory 
findings clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir 
disoproxil therapy. Seven patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 
and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Among them, 3 patients experienced a clinically meaningful decline in 
estimated GFR during therapy which improved after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil.
Other special populations
Individuals with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close 
monitoring of renal function is recommended in any adults with renal impairment receiving 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). The use of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not recommended in individuals under the age of 18 
years with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
HIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: The adverse reaction profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil in a limited number of HIV-infected patients in study GS-01-934 who were co-infected 
with HBV (n = 13) or HCV (n = 26) was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV 
without co-infection. However, as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and 
ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV infected population.
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HBV infected patients, clinical and 
laboratory evidence of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
If overdose occurs the individual must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and 
standard supportive treatment applied as necessary.
Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by 
haemodialysis. It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal 
dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations. ATC code: J05AR03
Mechanism of action
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to 
21
tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Both 
emtricitabine and tenofovir have activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and 
HIV-2) and hepatitis B virus.
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate 
and tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and 
tenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells. Emtricitabine triphosphate and 
tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain 
termination.
Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA 
polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo.
Antiviral activity in vitro
Synergistic antiviral activity was observed with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 
vitro. Additive to synergistic effects were observed in combination studies with protease inhibitors, 
and with nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase.
Resistance
In vitro: Resistance has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development 
of the M184V/I mutation with emtricitabine or the K65R mutation with tenofovir.
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but 
retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The K65R mutation can also 
be selected by abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus 
lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir. Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with HIV-
1 harbouring the K65R mutation. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has 
been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, 
lamivudine and tenofovir. HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations 
(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced 
susceptibility to tenofovir disoproxil.
In vivo - treatment of HIV-1: In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) in antiretroviral-
naïve patients, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all patients with confirmed 
HIV RNA > 400 copies/mL at weeks 48, 96 or 144 or at the time of early study drug discontinuation. 
As of week 144:
-
The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil /efavirenz group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed from 
the lamivudine/zidovudine/efavirenz group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher's Exact test comparing the 
emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all 
patients).
No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation.
Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 
13/19 (68%) patients in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil /efavirenz group and in virus 
from 21/29 (72%) patients in the comparative group.

Clinical data
In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934), antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected adult 
patients received either a once daily regimen of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz (n =
255) or a fixed combination of lamivudine and zidovudineadministered twice daily and efavirenz once 
daily (n = 254). Patients in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil group were given 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz from week 96 to week 144. At baseline the 
randomised groups had similar median plasma HIV-1 RNA (5.02 and 5.00 log10 copies/mL) and CD4 
counts (233 and 241 cells/mm3). The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the achievement and 
maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL over 48 weeks. Secondary 
22
efficacy analyses over 144 weeks included the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA concentrations 
< 400 or < 50 copies/mL, and change from baseline in CD4 cell count.
The 48-week primary endpoint data showed that the combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil 
and efavirenz provided superior antiviral efficacy as compared with the fixed combination of 
lamivudine and zidovudine with efavirenz as shown in Table 4. The 144 week secondary endpoint 
data are also presented in Table 4.

a: Van Elteren Test
In a randomised clinical study (M02-418), 190 antiretroviral-naïve adults were treated once daily with 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir given once or twice 
daily. At 48 weeks, 70% and 64% of patients demonstrated HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL with the once 
and twice daily regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively. The mean changes in CD4 cell count 
from baseline were +185 cells/mm3 and +196 cells/mm3, respectively.
Limited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with 
emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection 
results in a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log10 reduction or 4 to 5 log10 reduction, respectively) (see 
section 4.4).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 12 years 
have not been established.
Treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population
There are no clinical studies conducted with emtricitabine/tenofovir disproxil in the paediatric 
population with HIV-1 infection.
23
Clinical efficacy and safety of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil was established from studies 
conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil when given as single agents.
Studies with emtricitabine
In infants and children older than 4 months, the majority of patients taking emtricitabine achieved or 
maintained complete suppression of plasma HIV 1 RNA through 48 weeks (89% achieved ≤ 400 
copies/mL and 77% achieved ≤ 50 copies/mL).
Studies with tenofovir disoproxil
In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV 1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years of age 
were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an optimised 
background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of tenofovir 
disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV 1 RNA levels at week 24. 
However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult data and 
comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2).
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z 
score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, 
at baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar 
spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and 
placebo groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil group 
compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir disoproxil group and one 
adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). 
Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, BMD Z scores declined 
by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body.
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, 
virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either 
replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original 
regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks. At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment 
group and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV 1 RNA 
concentrations < 400 copies/mL. The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained < 400 
copies/mL at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment group. When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment 
group had HIV 1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL at week 48.
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received treatment with 
tenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z score was -1.034 and -
0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline. Mean 
changes at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z score, 
and -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or 
zidovudine groups, respectively. The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar 
between the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. 
Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine 
or zidovudine treatment group. One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or 
zidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48. BMD 
Z scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were 
treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks. BMD Z scores were not adjusted for height and weight.
In study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events. Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings 
clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil 
therapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
24
Absorption
The bioequivalence of one emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil film-coated tablet with one emtricitabine 
200 mg hard capsule and one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet was established following 
single dose administration to fasting healthy subjects. Following oral administration of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to healthy subjects, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are 
rapidly absorbed and tenofovir disoproxil is converted to tenofovir. Maximum emtricitabine and 
tenofovir concentrations are observed in serum within 0.5 to 3.0 h of dosing in the fasted state. 
Administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with food resulted in a delay of approximately 
three quarters of an hour in reaching maximum tenofovir concentrations and increases in tenofovir 
AUC and Cmax of approximately 35% and 15%, respectively, when administered with a high fat or 
light meal, compared to administration in the fasted state. In order to optimise the absorption of 
tenofovir, it is recommended that Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should preferably be 
taken with food.
Distribution
Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution of emtricitabine and tenofovir was 
approximately 1.4 L/kg and 800 mL/kg, respectively. After oral administration of emtricitabine or 
tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine and tenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body. In vitro
binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of concentration over 
the range of 0.02 to 200 µg/mL. In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was 
less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/mL.
Biotransformation
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes 
oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and 
conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). In vitro
studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 
enzymes. Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of 
the major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation. Also, emtricitabine did not 
inhibit uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation.
Elimination
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in 
urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine 
dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 
307 mL/min. Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 
10 hours.
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system 
with approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous 
administration. The apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 mL/min. Renal 
clearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 mL/min, which is in excess of the glomerular 
filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of 
tenofovir. Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 
18 hours.
Elderly
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine or tenofovir (administered as 
tenofovir disoproxil) in the elderly (over 65 years of age).
Gender
25
Emtricitabine and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female patients.
Ethnicity
No clinically important pharmacokinetic difference due to ethnicity has been identified for 
emtricitabine. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) have not been 
specifically studied in different ethnic groups.
Paediatric population
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children 
and adolescents (under 18 years of age). Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 
8 HIV-1 infected adolescent patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 23 HIV-
1 infected children aged 2 to < 12 years. Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients 
receiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir 
disoproxil up to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving 
once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed 
with tenofovir disoproxil in children under 2 years. In general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine 
in infants, children and adolescents (aged 4 months up to 18 years) are similar to those seen in adults.
Renal impairment
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for emtricitabine and tenofovir after co-administration of 
separate preparations or as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in patients with renal impairment. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were mainly determined following administration of single doses of 
emtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected subjects with varying 
degrees of renal impairment. The degree of renal impairment was defined according to baseline 
creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function when CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild impairment with 
CrCl = 50-79 mL/min; moderate impairment with CrCl = 30-49 mL/min and severe impairment with 
CrCl = 10-29 mL/min).
The mean (%CV) emtricitabine drug exposure increased from 12 (25%) µg•h/mL in subjects with 
normal renal function, to 20 (6%) µg•h/mL, 25 (23%) µg•h/mL and 34 (6%) µg•h/mL, in subjects with 
mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. The mean (%CV) tenofovir drug exposure 
increased from 2,185 (12%) ng•h/mL in subjects with normal renal function, to 3,064 (30%) ng•h/mL, 
6,009 (42%) ng•h/mL and 15,985 (45%) ng•h/mL, in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment, respectively.
The increased dose interval for emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected patients with 
moderate renal impairment is expected to result in higher peak plasma concentrations and lower Cmin
levels as compared to patients with normal renal function. In subjects with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug exposures substantially increased over 72 
hours to 53 (19%) µg•h/mL of emtricitabine, and over 48 hours to 42,857 (29%) ng•h/mL of tenofovir.
A small clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of 
tenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine in HIV infected patients with renal impairment. 
A subgroup of patients with baseline creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 mL/min, receiving once 
daily dosing, had a 2-4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure and worsening renal function.
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) in 
paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied. No data are available to make dose 
recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Hepatic impairment
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been studied in subjects with 
26
hepatic impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of hepatic insufficiency. In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected 
subjects were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients.
A single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) classification. 
Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment 
suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects. The mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax and 
AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/mL and 2,050 (50.8%) ng•h/mL, respectively, in normal subjects 
compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/mL and 2,310 (43.5%) ng•h/mL in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/mL and 2,740 (44.0%) ng•h/mL in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Emtricitabine: Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic 
potential and toxicity to reproduction and development.
Tenofovir disoproxil: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no 
special hazard for humans. Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels 
greater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include 
renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed 
as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced BMD (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats 
and dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity 
occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-
fold the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a 
substance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in 
BMD.
Genotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results 
in one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat 
hepatocytes. However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an 
extremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans.
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or 
foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a 
periand postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.
Combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil: Genotoxicity and repeated dose toxicity 
studies of one month or less with the combination of these two components found no exacerbation of 
toxicological effects compared to studies with the separate components.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is and what it is used for
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. contains two active substances, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil. Both of these active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to 
treat HIV infection. Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a 
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they 
work by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for 
the virus to reproduce itself.
-
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults.
It is also used to treat HIV in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 
35 kg, and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that are no longer effective 
or have caused side effects.
-
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should always be used combined with other 
medicines to treat HIV infection.
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. can be administered in place of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil used separately at the same doses.
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.
2. What you need to know before you take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.if you are allergic to emtricitabine, 
tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
→ If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately.
Warnings and precautions
42
While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. to treat HIV
-
-
-
-
-
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. may affect your kidneys. Before and during 
treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. Tell your doctor if you 
have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d. should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney problems. If you 
have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d. or, if you already have HIV, to take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. less frequently. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not recommended if 
you have severe kidney disease or are on dialysis.
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures.
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss was 
seen in clinical studies when patients were treated for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with a boosted protease inhibitor.
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in 
adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.
Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are at a 
higher risk of fractures.
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients 
infected with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are 
treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. 
If you have hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for 
you.
Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d.. If you have HBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop 
taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., whether or not you also have HIV. It is 
important not to stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. without talking to 
your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d..
Talk to your doctor if you are over 65. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. has not 
been studied in patients over 65 years of age.
Talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. contains lactose later in this section).
Children and adolescents
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not for use in children under 12 years of age.
Other medicines and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. if you are already taking other medicines 
that contain the components of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. (emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil) or any other antiviral medicines that contain tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine 
or adefovir dipivoxil.
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with other medicines that can damage 
your kidneys: it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, 
43
including
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection)
amphotericin B (for fungal infection)
foscarnet (for viral infection)
ganciclovir (for viral infection)
pentamidine (for infections)
vancomycin (for bacterial infection)
interleukin-2 (to treat cancer)
cidofovir (for viral infection)
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains)
If you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may 
order blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function.
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection.
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with other medicines containing 
didanosine (for treatment of HIV infection): Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood 
and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess 
lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes death, have been reported when medicines 
containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully 
consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine.
→ Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with food and drink
-
Whenever possible, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be taken with food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
If you have taken Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. during your pregnancy, your doctor 
may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In 
children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV 
outweighed the risk of side effects.
-
-
-
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.. 
This is because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your 
doctor as soon as possible.

-
-
If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d., take the tablet preferably with food as soon as possible. Then take the next dose at 
your usual time.
If you notice 12 hours or more after the time you usually take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d., forget about the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose, preferably with 
food, at your usual time.
If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., take 
another tablet. You do not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d..
45
If you stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
-
Stopping tablets may reduce the effectiveness of the anti-HIV therapy recommended by your 
doctor.
→ Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. without contacting your 
doctor.
If you have hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for several 
months after stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping 
treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-
threatening.
→ Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Possible serious side effects:
-
-
-
Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side 
effect. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in 
people with liver disease. The following may be signs of lactic acidosis:
-
-
-
-
→ If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately.
deep rapid breathing
drowsiness
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)
stomach pain
Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) 
and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune 
system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
anti-HIV treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in 
the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms.
Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as:
-
-
-
→ If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, get medical help 
immediately.
muscle weakness
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity

47
-
-
-
-
-
The frequency of the following side effects is not known.
-
Bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). Taking this type of medicine for a long 
time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being 
overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of 
osteonecrosis are:
-
-
-
joint stiffness
joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder)
difficulty with movement
→ If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.
During treatment for HIV there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. 
This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the 
HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Other effects in children
-
darkening of the skin in patches
Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including
-
Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia).
-
This may cause the child to be tired or breathless
-
→ If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.

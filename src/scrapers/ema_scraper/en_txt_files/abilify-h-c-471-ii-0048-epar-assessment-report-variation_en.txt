1.   Introduction 
In general, there is consensus that schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder both in childhood and 
adolescence  as  well  as  in  adulthood.  The  lifetime  prevalence  of  schizophrenia  is  approximately 1%.  
It is assumed that only 0.1 to 1% of all schizophrenic psychoses manifest themselves before the age of 
10, and 70% of all schizophrenic disorders occur between the age of 20 and 451. 
The prevalence rate of very early-onset schizophrenia (manifestation before the age of 12) is less than 
one  child  in  10,000 children  between  2  and  12 years  of  age2  .  It  is  estimated  that  childhood-onset 
schizophrenia  is  approximately  50 times  less  frequent  than  adult-onset  schizophrenia.  There  is  a 
remarkable increase of schizophrenia after the 13th year of life3, and the prevalence of schizophrenia 
among adolescents has been estimated to be as high as 0.5%4. 
The  course  of  the  disease  in  the  adolescent  population  is  variable.  Some  adolescents  with 
schizophrenia  experience  only  one  cycle  of  these  phases,  although  most  have  multiple  cycles5.  
The  long-term  outcome  of  adolescents  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  has  been  studied  by  several 
investigators and psychiatrists in follow-up studies. In the majority of cases schizophrenia turned out 
to be a chronic or relapsing disorder with only a minority of patients that were fully employed or were 
attending school full-time6. 
In a published retrospective study7 , only 37% and 42% of patients had no symptoms and no findings 
after  follow-up  examinations  at  5 years  and  11 years,  respectively.  Moreover,  21%  and  20%  of  the 
patients  were  hospitalized  for  the  entire  6 months  proceeding  the  follow-up  examinations  at  5  and 
11 years, respectively.  
In this type II variation, the MAH applied for an extension of indication of Abilify as follows (the new 
indication is underlined): 
‘treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents (13-17 years).’ 
In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  update  the  details  of  the  local  representatives  for 
Estonia, Belgium and Luxembourg. 
2.  Non Clinical aspects 
Toxicology 
To  support  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  in  adolescents  (13-17  years),  4  non  clinical  studies 
were  conducted  to  investigate  the  oral  toxicity  of  aripiprazole  in  juvenile  dogs  (DM4042  and 
DM04023)  and  postnatal  and/or  juvenile  rats  (DN04081  and  DN04048).  The  non  clinical  studies 
D04048  and  DM4023  were  not  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Laboratory  Practices  (GLP)  as 
stated by the MAH. 
In study DN04048, results suggested that rat exposure to aripiprazole and its metabolite was higher at 
earlier age (Post-Natal-Day or PND 7) and decreased with age. The values collected at the same PNDs 
were  similar,  reinforcing  the  idea  that  exposure  change  seen  along  time  may  be  related  to 
developmental aspects.

In  study  DN04081,  oral  administration  of  doses  of  10,  20,  and  40  mg/kg/day  of  aripiprazole  to 
juvenile rats from PND 21-80 resulted in in-life, behavioral, developmental, and clinical and anatomic 
pathology  findings.  All  drug-related  findings  in  male  rats  and  most  findings  in  female  rats  were 
reversible.  Additionally,  no  evidence  of  neurotoxicity  was  observed  further  to  the  microscopic 
examination  of  the  brain  finding  in  the  study  (i.e  increased  diagonal  length  across  the  striatum 
(caudate-putamen) of the brain in females) and this finding did not appear to translate into behavioural 
changes up to animal adulthood. 
In  study  DM04042,  the  principal  drug-related  findings  in  juvenile  dogs  given  daily  doses  of  3,  10, 
and/or 30 mg/kg aripiprazole for 6 months were pharmacologically mediated, central nervous system-
related clinical observations (ie, hypoactivity, tremors, ataxia) in both sexes and minimally to mildly 
reduced  body  weight  gain  in  females.  There  were  no  drug-related  findings  in  the  neurobehavioral 
assessment  or  in  the  comprehensive  microscopic  examination  of  the  central  and  peripheral  nervous 
systems at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures up to 23100 ng.h/mL aripiprazole and 19100 
ng.h/mL metabolite). All drug-related changes observed were reversible. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
At the time of the submission of this application, the MAH referred to the ERA previously submitted 
within the approved type II variation to extend the indication of oral aripiprazole in the treatment and 
prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I disorder (EMEA/H/C/471/II/39).  
Results  of  a  number  of  ERA  studies  (OECD  106,  OECD  211,  OECD  308  and  OECD  210)  were 
subsequently  evaluated  by  the  CHMP  as  part  of  commitments  and  considered  fulfilled,  provided  an 
updated ERA assessment was provided by the MAH. 
During  the  assessment  of  this  variation,  the  MAH  provided  further  ERA  update  with  currently 
available data on ecotoxicity and fate, which included new data on the Collembola Reproduction test 
ISO 11267. Following this update, the PEC/PNECsoil ratio changed from 0.0051 to 0.12. 
Although the value of the PEC/PNEC soil ratio (<1), the CHMP considered that the terrestrial fate and 
effect  analyses  should  be  completed  prior  any  conclusions  are  made  on  the  terrestrial  impact  of 
aripiprazole. The MAH proposed to submit these studies, OECD 216 (Soil Micro-organism: Nitrogen 
Transformation Test) and 307  (Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in soil), and the updated ERA 
terrestrial  compartment,  as  part  of  a  follow-up  measure,  which  was  considered  acceptable  by  the 
CHMP with an agreed deadline. 
At present, the MAH predicted that the approval of oral aripiprazole in the new proposed indication 
will not significantly increase the use of aripiprazole in the EU. Based on available forecasts, the use 
of aripiprazole is estimated to account for approximately 1.0% of the total aripiprazole use in the EU. 
Discussion on non clinical aspects 
A comparative analysis of the findings observed in juvenile and adults animal studies was performed 
by  the  MAH.  Results  indicated  that  most  of  the  effects  observed  in  the  juvenile  rats,  through 
administration  in  the  two  development  periods  were  also  observed  in  adults,  many  of  these  effects 
being possibly related to the pharmacological activity of aripiprazole.  
Overall, the CHMP considers that the studies in juvenile animals did not give evidence for a different 
toxicological  profile  of  aripiprazole  in  relation  to  adult  animals,  and  did  not  raise  particular 
developmental  concerns  regarding  its  use  in  paediatric  patients  ≥  13  years  of  age  as  claimed  in  the 
proposed indication. 
The  main  concerns  related  to  potential  effects  of  aripiprazole  in  postnatal  development,  including 
brain and sexual development, were covered during the treatment period in these non-clinical juvenile 
toxicity  studies.  Moreover,  despite  the  fact  that  adult  monkeys  have  been  used  to  support  the  adult 
indication,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  difficulties  associated  with  the  availability  of  the  monkey

species and the handling aspects of very young animals, which justified the use of juvenile dogs as the 
non-rodent species.  
According  to  the  CHMP  guideline  on  ‘the  need  for  non-clinical  testing  in  juvenile  animals  of 
pharmaceuticals  for  paediatric  indications’(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005,  January  2008), 
appropriate studies in one species only could have been acceptable.  
Considering  that  the  systemic  exposures  of  the  animals  at  40mg/Kg/day  dose  were  1.9-2.9  fold  the 
exposures  achieved  in  children  with  the  dose  of  30mg,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  these 
exposures  were  appropriate  and  in  line  with  the  recommendations  provided  in  the  above  CHMP 
guideline. 
The  studies  in  juvenile  animals  did  not  give  evidence  for  a  different  toxicological  profile  of 
aripiprazole in relation to adult animals, and did not raise particular developmental concerns regarding 
its use in pediatric patients ≥ 13 years of age as claimed in this application. 
With respect to the ERA, the CHMP requested the MAH to provide a justification on the change of the 
Csludge value applied in the latest submitted ERA. Furthermore, a full ERA should be submitted once 
the terrestrial risk analysis is completed.  
3.  Clinical aspects 
The clinical development program completed to support the proposed extension of indication in 
adolescents (13-17 years), consisted of: 
- 
two Phase I studies to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of aripiprazole in children and 
adolescent  patients  with  a  primary  schizophrenia  spectrum  diagnosis,  bipolar  spectrum 
diagnosis, or other paediatric psychiatric disorders between the age of 10 - 17 years (Study 31-
03-238)  and  in  children  and  adolescents  with  conduct  disorders  between  the  age  of 
6 - 17 years (Study CN138014); 
-  One  randomised,  double-  blind,  placebo  controlled  study  (31-03-239),  conducted  in 
adolescents  (13  to  17 years  ),  with  a  DSM-IV  (Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders  –  Fourth  Edition)  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia,  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
aripiprazole (two fixed doses, 10 mg and 30 mg) compared to placebo; 
-  Two  phase  III/IIIb  open-label  studies  (31-03-241  and  31-05-243),  designed  to  provide 
additional long term safety data of aripiprazole in the paediatric population. Patients who had 
completed study 31-03-239 were offered to continue in the open-label, flexible-dose study 31-
03-241  for  an  additional  26 weeks;  thereafter,  patients  who  had  completed  study  31-03-241 
were offered to continue in the open-label, flexible-dose study 31-05-243 (ongoing roll-over 
study). 
Additional pharmacokinetic analysis (study 31-05-242) was performed and included a comparison 
with historical data from adults. 
Pharmacokinetics 
  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
1)  Study 31-03-238 
The objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated 
doses  of  aripiprazole  following  oral  administration  to  children  and  adolescent  subjects(10-17  years)  
with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar spectrum disorders. This was a multicenter, open-
label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation trial with aripiprazole at doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg.  
Page 4 of 30

Subjects  were  treated  in  sequential  cohorts  receiving  escalating  doses  of  aripiprazole  ranging  from 
2 mg  to  a  maximum  of  30 mg.  After  subjects  were  deemed  eligible  to  participate,  they  entered  the 
dose-escalation  phase  of  the  study.  Subjects  were  administered  aripiprazole  oral  tablets  for  a 
maximum of 12 days (depending of the maximum dose of the cohort) using a forced titration scheme 
to achieve one of the following dose levels: 20 mg, 25 mg, or 30 mg. Subjects then entered a fixed-
dose phase and were administered the maximum dose for that cohort for 14 days.  
A  total  of  21 subjects  were  enrolled,  8 subjects  in  the  20 mg  cohort,  7 subjects  in  the  25 mg  cohort, 
and 6 subjects in the 30 mg cohort. Seventeen subjects (81%) completed the dose-escalation and fixed-
dose  phases.  Four  subjects  (19%)  discontinued  prematurely  from  the  study,  2  (2/8;  25%)  in  the 
aripiprazole  20 mg  cohort  due  to  protocol  deviation  (n=1)  and  withdrawal  of  consent  (n=1),  and  2 
(2/7; 29%) in the aripiprazole 25 mg cohort due to the AEs ‘dystonic reaction’ (n=1) and ‘akathisia’ 
(n=1), respectively. 
Aripiprazole doses were titrated to the final fixed dose that was given for 14 days to achieve steady-
state  plasma  concentrations.  Mean  plasma  levels  of  aripiprazole  peaked  approximately  2 hours  after 
the dose and declined slowly thereafter. 
In children and adolescent subjects with different psychiatric diagnoses aged from 10 to 17 years the 
pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear. Cmax values were higher compared to adult subjects, due 
to differences in body weights. Oral clearance of aripiprazole was similar in children/adolescents and 
adults when adjusted for body weights. The AUCτ ratio in children and adolescents was similar to that 
from adult subjects. 
Similarly to aripiprazole, the pharmacokinetics of dehydro-aripiprazole (major active metabolite) were 
linear, and Cmax values in children and adolescents were higher compared to adults because of lower 
body  weights.  The  AUCτ  ratio  of  dehydro-aripiprazole  relative  to  aripiprazole  was  similar  between 
children/adolescents and adults.  
2)  Study CN138014 
The objectives of this study were to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of aripiprazole following 
multiple  oral  doses  of  approximately  0.1 mg/kg  per  day  in  children  (6  to  12 years)  and  adolescents  
(13 to 17 years) with a diagnosis of conduct disorders. This was an open-label, 15-day, 3-center study 
with an optional 36-month open-label safety extension.  
For  Phase  A  (from  Screening  to  Day 15),  subjects  received  daily  doses  of  approximately  0.1 mg/kg 
aripiprazole starting on Day 1 and continuing through Day 14. Specifically, administered daily doses 
were  1 mg  for  subjects  weighing  less  than  25 kg,  2 mg  for  subjects  weighing  25  to  50 kg,  5 mg  for 
subjects  weighing  50  to  70 kg,  and  10 mg  for  subjects  weighing  more  than  70 kg.  If  doses  of  2  to 
10 mg  aripiprazole  were  poorly  tolerated,  subsequent  doses  may  have  been  reduced  at  the 
Investigator’s discretion. Subjects who successfully completed Phase A of the study were permitted to 
enter the 36-month extension period (Phase B) with no interruption of dosing.  
A  total  of  23  subjects  (12  children  and  11  adolescents)  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  All  subjects 
completed Phase A of the study and continued on into Phase B. During this phase, 5 subjects (21.7%) 
completed treatment.  
Eighteen subjects (78.3%) were discontinued from the study. Of these, 7 subjects were lost to follow-
up,  6  subjects  were  discontinued  for  non-compliance,  3  subjects  withdrew  consent,  and  2 subjects 
discontinued  for  lack  of  efficacy  and  protocol  dose  limitations,  respectively.  No  subjects  were 
discontinued  due  to  AEs.  Ten  subjects  discontinued  prior  to  completion  of  1  year  of  the  study  (one 
subject  discontinued  prior  to  completion  of  Period  A),  5  subjects  discontinued  after  enrollment  for 
between 1 and 2 years and 2 subjects discontinued after enrollment for over 2 years.

In  children  and  adolescents  who  received  a  daily  dose  of  aripiprazole  through  Days 1  to  14  of  the 
study, aripiprazole geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were between 2.4 and 6.4-times higher on 
Day 14 compared to Day 1. This extent of accumulation was similar for children and adolescents and 
was also similar to a 3- to 5-fold accumulation observed in young adults.  
The apparent clearance values for aripiprazole were similar in children, adolescents, and adults when 
normalized for body weights, and appeared to be independent of the aripiprazole dose.  
Steady-state was attained within 14 days of dosing in both paediatric and adult populations.  
The  overall  metabolic  profile  was  similar  in  children  and  adolescents.  Similarly  to  adults,  dehydro-
aripiprazole was the predominant circulating metabolite in the plasma of children and adolescents with 
mean exposure values being approximately one-quarter to one-third of those of aripiprazole. 
  Additional pharmacokinetic analysis 
3)  Study 31-05-242 
The objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in children and 
adolescent patients (ages 10-17 years), 2) investigate the impact of key covariates, especially size and 
age,  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  aripiprazole  and  3)  estimate  the  between  and  random  residual 
variability 
The  pharmacokinetic  analysis  contained  1,444 plasma  samples  of  343 patients  from  three  different 
clinical studies (31-03-238, 31-03-239 and 31-03-240).  
The demographics and size were relatively well-balanced across the three studies. Patient body weight 
correlates with age i.e from 10 to 14 years.  
Typical population PK parameters (95% CI) given the reference covariates (70 kg weight and 50 kg 
lean  body  mass)  were  3.44  (3.26, 3.63) L/h,  255  (231,  283) L,  and  1.67  (0.748,  4.28) h-1  for  CL,  V, 
and  Ka,  respectively.  Model  performance  assessments  showed  adequate  precision  of  the  parameter 
estimates and slight under prediction for concentrations greater than 650 ng/mL.  
Approximately 3% of the concentrations were greater than 650 ng/mL.  
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  aripiprazole  in  the  paediatric  patients  was  linear  across  evaluated 
doses.  
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  aripiprazole  in  the  analysed  paediatric  population    appeared  to  be 
similar to adults, when compared to historical adult population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
  Discussion on pharmacokinetic aspects 
Based  on  studies  31-03-238  and  CN138014,  the  linearity  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of 
aripiprazole in children and adolescents can be considered as established. In the paediatric population, 
Cmax  levels  were  generally  higher  compared  to  those  reported  from  studies  with  adults.  However, 
when  values  were  normalized  for  body  weight,  apparent  oral  clearance  was  similar  in  children, 
adolescents, and adults. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  steady-state  was  attained  after  14 days  of  oral  daily  (QD)  dosing  of 
aripiprazole;  similarily  to  the  time  to  steady-state  observed  in  studies  with  adults.    Aripiprazole 
accumulation after 14 days of dosing was similar between children and adolescents i.e 2.4- to 6.4-fold 
and adults i.e 3 to 5 fold.

The  overall  metabolic  profile  following  oral  dosing  of  aripiprazole  was  similar  in  children  and 
adolescents, with dehydro-aripiprazole as the predominant circulating metabolite.  
Clinical efficacy 
  Main clinical study 
1)  Study 31-03-239 
METHODS 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 
Objective 
The objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of two fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 mg and 30 mg) 
compared  to  placebo  in  adolescent  subjects,  13  to  17 years  of  age  (inclusive),  with  a  DSM-IV 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Treatment period 
After a minimum 3-day antipsychotic washout period, patients were evenly randomized to receive a 
double-blind medication as follows:  
-  Arm  1  (10 mg  treatment  arm):  aripiprazole  2  mg  QD  for  2  days,  aripiprazole  5 mg  QD  for 
2 days, and aripiprazole 10 mg QD as the target dose, starting on Day 5; 
-  Arm  2  (30  mg  treatment  arm):  aripiprazole  2 mg  QD  for  2 days,  aripiprazole  5 mg  QD  for 
2 days,  aripiprazole  10  mg  QD  for  2  days,  aripiprazole  15  mg  QD  for  2  days,  aripiprazole 
20 mg QD for 2 days, and aripiprazole 30 mg QD as the target dose, starting on Day 11; 
-  Arm 3 (placebo arm): matching placebo for aripiprazole tablets. 
Aripiprazole was titrated to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mg treatment arm and in 11 days in the 
30 mg  treatment  arm.    Subjects  remained  at  the  assigned  dose  for  at  least  2 weeks.  Subjects  who 
experienced  dose-related  tolerability  issues  prior  to  study  Day 25  were  to  be  discontinued  from  the 
study. Beginning on Day 26, investigators could decrease the dose of aripiprazole for tolerability (to 
5 mg QD in the 10 mg treatment arm and to 15 mg QD in the 30 mg treatment arm).  
Inclusion Criteria 
Male and female subjects, 13 to 17 years of age, with a K-SADS-PL (Schedule for Affective Disorders 
and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children: Present and Lifetime Version) confirmed Axis I (DSM-
IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia. The initial diagnosis was to be made by an experienced clinician who 
was  trained  in  treating  adolescent  patients  with  a  psychiatric  disorder.  The  DSM-IV  diagnosis  was 
confirmed  by  a  K-SADS-PL  interview  administered  by  a  trained  clinician.  Patients  were  to  have  a 
PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) Total Score ≥ 70 at baseline (Day 1). 
Sample size 
The study was designed to have 85% power given a difference between aripiprazole and placebo of -
11.4 for the change from baseline in PANSS Total Score. The difference of -11.4 was the median of 
the mean differences seen in the adults for schizophrenia over the aripiprazole dose ranges of 2 to 10 
mg QD and 2 to 30 mg QD. A pooled standard deviation (SD) of 22.5 was used.

Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  the  mean  change  from  Baseline  to  Endpoint  (Day 42)  in  the 
PANSS Total Score. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy measures were the mean changes in scores from Baseline to Endpoint (Day 42) in 
the  Children’s  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS),  Clinical  Global  Impression  (CGI)-Severity  Scale, 
CGI-Improvement  Scale,  and  PANSS  Positive  and  PANSS  Negative  Subscales;  and  time  to 
discontinuation due to all reasons. 
Other outcome measures 
Other  outcome  measures  were  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  Endpoint  (Day  42)  in  Pediatric 
Quality  of  Life  Enjoyment  and  Satisfaction  Questionnaire  (P-QLES-Q)  Total  Score  and  Pediatric 
Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-QLES-Q) Overall Score. 
Post hoc analyses 
Post-hoc  analyses  were  performed  to  determine  the  percentage  of  subjects  achieving  remission, 
defined as a score of mild or less (≤ 3) for items P1, P2, P3, N1, N4, N6, G5, and G9 in the PANSS 
Score. 
RESULTS 
Patient distribution 
A total of 302 subjects were randomized and treated in this study: 100/302 (33.1%) in the aripiprazole 
10 mg arm, 102/302 (33.8%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 100/302 (33.1%) in the placebo arm. 
Of the 302 subjects randomized, all were analyzed for efficacy. All subjects having a baseline and a 
post-baseline  efficacy  measurement  were  included  in  a  “change  from  baseline”  analysis,  and  all 
subjects  having  a  post-baseline  measurement  were  included  in  CGI-I  analysis  based  only  on  post-
baseline measurements.  
A  total  of  258/302  (85.4%)  subjects  completed  the  study  (at  day  42):  84/100  (84.0%)  in  the 
aripiprazole  10 mg  arm,  84/102  (82.4%)  in  the  aripiprazole  30 mg  arm,  and  90/100  (90.0%)  in  the 
placebo  arm.  Overall,  AEs  and  subject  withdrawal  of  consent  were  the  most  common  reasons  for 
discontinuation. 
The  mean  age  in  the  groups  of  patients  treated  with  aripiprazole  (10,  30 mg)  or  placebo  was  15.6, 
15.4, or 15.4 years, respectively, with a range between 13 and 17 years for each treatment group.

p = 0.0004) for the aripiprazole 30 mg arm.   
Other Outcome Measures 
Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-
QLES-Q) Total Score 
Using  the  LOCF  data  set,  improvements  were  observed  in  all  three  treatment  arms;  however,  no 
statistically significant differences were observed between either of the aripiprazole arms and placebo.  
Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-
QLES-Q) Overall Score 
Using this data set, baseline scores were statistically significantly higher in the placebo arm than in the 
aripiprazole  10 mg  arm  (p = 0.0477).  At  Week 6,  statistically  significant  improvements  compared  to 
placebo  were  seen  in  the  aripiprazole  10 mg  arm  (0.6  versus  0.1,  p  =  0.0045)  and  the  aripiprazole 
30 mg arm (0.6 versus 0.1, p = 0.0030). The difference from placebo in mean change from baseline at 
Week 6 was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.13 to 0.68; p = 0.0045) for the aripiprazole 10 mg arm and 0.40 (95% 
CI = 0.14 to 0.67; p = 0.0030). 
Post hoc analysis - Percentage of Subjects Achieving Remission 
Using the LOCF data set, the percentage of subjects achieving remission was statistically significantly 
greater than placebo for the 10 mg aripiprazole arm (53/99, 53.5% for aripiprazole 10 mg compared 
with 35/98, 35.7% for placebo; p = 0.0130); as well as for the 30 mg aripiprazole arm (56/97, 57.7%; 
p = 0.0024 against placebo). 
  Supportive studies 
1)  Study 31-03-241 
METHODS 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, open-label, flexible dose study. All subjects enrolled in Study 31-03-241 had 
previously completed Study 31-03-239  (adolescents with schizophrenia) or had withdrawn from the 
double-blind extension phase of Study 31-03-240 (children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder).  
Subjects enrolled in Study 31-03-241 were eligible to receive up to a total of 6 months of open-label 
aripiprazole treatment at daily doses of 2 mg to 30 mg. The open-label trial overlapped with the parent 
study for 1 day. The End of Treatment evaluations conducted at the last office visit of the parent study 
served as baseline (Day 0) evaluation for this open-label trial. 
Objective 
The  objective  is  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  aripiprazole  by  enrolling  subjects 
from the parent studies.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy  and  other  outcome  measures  were  summarised  as  changes  from  baseline  using  descriptive 
statistics. 
Efficacy outcome measures 
The efficacy outcome measures for subject with schizophrenia were mean changes from baseline on 
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score, the Positive and Negative subscales; 
the  Clinical  Global  Impression  Severity  Scale  (CGI-S)  score  and  mean  CGI-I  score;  the  Children’s 
Depression  Rating  Scale-Revised  (CDRS-R);  the  Children’s  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS); 
evaluated by visit. 
Other outcome measures 
The Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-QLES-Q) (translated into 
different languages when applicable) was completed  by each subject at baseline (Day 0) and End of 
Treatment/Early Termination (Week 26). 
RESULTS 
Patient distribution, Extent of Exposure 
A total of 239 adolescent schizophrenia patients from the parent study 31-03-239 were enrolled, for 
whom an average daily dose of aripiprazole of 16.7 mg was calculated. One hundred and eighty-one 
subjects (75.7%) completed the study. A total of 28/239 (11.7%) subjects withdrew consent and 7/239 
(2.9%) were lost to follow-up. 6/239 (2.5%) subjects discontinued study medication due to AEs. 
For two of the patients, no post-baseline measurement for any efficacy endpoint was available. Of the 
remaining 237 patients, for whom efficacy results were available, 80 patients were treated with 10 mg 
aripiprazole,  78 patients  with  30 mg  aripiprazole  and  79 patients  were  treated  with  placebo  in  the 
parent study.  
Primary efficacy measures 
PANSS Total Score 
During this study, improvements were observed at each post-baseline visit. The greatest improvement 
was  observed  in  the  subjects  formerly  in  the  placebo  arm  of  the  parent  study,  who  showed  a  mean 
decrease from baseline in PANSS Total Score of -10.71 at the Last Visit. For subjects formerly in the 
10 mg and 30 mg aripiprazole treatment arms, improvements were maintained over time, including at 
the Last Visit (mean changes from baseline of -5.23 and -6.21, respectively). 
CGI Severity Score 
During this study, improvements were observed at each post-baseline visit starting at Week 2 for the 
total aripiprazole group. The greatest improvement seen at Last Visit was in the subjects formerly in 
the placebo arm of the parent study, who showed a mean decrease from baseline in CGI-S of -0.70. 
For  subjects  formerly  in  the  aripiprazole  10 mg  and  30 mg  treatment  groups,  improvements  were 
maintained  over  time  starting  from  Weeks 2  to  3,  including  at  the  Last  Visit  (mean  changes  from 
baseline of -0.38 and -0.45, respectively).

CGI Improvement Score 
For the CGI-Improvement, a lesser mean score indicated improvement. At Week 1, the mean scores in 
the  groups  that  formerly  received  aripiprazole  10 mg,  aripiprazole  30 mg,  and  placebo,  respectively, 
were 2.82, 3.06, and 3.14, which generally indicated improvement. Scores were decreased from these 
Week 1  values  for  all  three  groups  at  every  subsequent  visit,  indicating  improvements  at  each  visit 
over  time.  The  greatest  improvement  seen  at  the  Last  Visit  was  in  the  subjects  formerly  in  the 
aripiprazole  30 mg  arm  of  the  parent  study,  who  had  a  mean  CGI-I  Score  of  2.38  at  the  Last  Visit 
compared  to  3.06  at  Week  1.  For  subjects  formerly  in  the  10 mg  and  placebo  treatment  arms, 
improvements were also observed at the Last Visit, with mean scores of 2.26 and 2.53 compared with 
Week 1 scores of 2.82 and 3.14, respectively. 
PANSS Positive Subscale Score 
During this study, improvements were observed at each post-baseline visit. The greatest improvement 
seen was in the subjects formerly in the placebo arm of the parent study, who showed a mean decrease 
from baseline in PANSS Total Score of -2.91 at the Last Visit. For subjects formerly in the 10 mg and 
30 mg treatment arms, improvements were maintained over time; at the Last Visit, the mean changes 
from baseline were -1.61 and -1.87, respectively. 
PANSS Negative Subscale Score 
During this study, improvements were observed at each post-baseline visit. The greatest improvement 
seen was in the subjects formerly in the placebo arm of the parent study, who showed a mean decrease 
from baseline in PANSS Total Score of -3.03 at the Last Visit. For subjects formerly in the 10 mg and 
30 mg treatment arms, improvements were maintained over time; at the Last Visit, the mean changes 
from baseline were -1.33 and -1.70, respectively. 
Children’s Global Assessment Scale Score 
The greatest improvement seen was in the subjects formerly in the placebo arm of the parent study, 
who  showed  a  mean  increase  from  baseline  in  CGAS  Score  of  8.90  at  the  Last  Visit.  For  subjects 
formerly  in  the  10 mg  and  30 mg  treatment  arms,  improvements  were  maintained  over  time;  at  the 
Last Visit, the mean changes from baseline were 6.86 and 6.97, respectively. 
Children’s Depression Rating Scale – Revised Score 
The greatest improvement seen was in the subjects formerly in the placebo arm of the parent study, 
who showed a mean decrease from baseline in CDRS-R Score of -5.49 at the Last Visit. For subjects 
formerly  in  the  10 mg  and  30 mg  treatment  arms,  improvements  were  maintained  over  time;  at  the 
Last Visit, the mean changes from baseline were -1.62 and -2.83, respectively. 
Other outcome measures 
Change  From  Baseline  in  Pediatric  Quality  of  Life  Enjoyment  and  Satisfaction  Questionnaire  (P-
QLES-Q) Total Score 
The  greatest  improvement  seen  was  in  the  subjects  formerly  in  the  placebo  arm  of  the  parent  study 
who  showed  a  mean  increase  from  baseline  in  P-QLES-Q  Total  Score  of  2.28  at  the  Last  Visit.  
For subjects  formerly in the 10  mg and 30 mg treatment arms, improvements were  maintained over 
time (mean change from baseline 0.67 and 0.57, respectively).

The greatest improvement seen was in the subjects formerly in the placebo arm of the parent study, 
who  showed  a  mean  increase  from  baseline  in  P-QLES-Q  Overall  Score  of  0.16  at  the  Last  Visit.  
For subjects formerly in the 10 mg and 30 mg treatment arms, test scores were slightly decreased at 
the Last Visit (mean changes from baseline of -0.01 and -0.08, respectively). 
1)  Study 31-05-243 (ongoing) 
This  study  is  currently  ongoing.  An  interim  analysis  was  conducted  with  a  cut-off  date  of  
21 June 2007. 
METHODS 
Study design 
This is an open-label multicenter, rollover study.  
Objective 
The  objective  is  to  continue  to  provide  flexible  doses  of  aripiprazole  therapy  (5 mg,  10 mg,  and/or 
15 mg tablets) to adolescents (13-17 years of age) and adults (adolescents who reached 18 during the 
studies 31-03-239 or 31-03-241) male and female subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia 
and  who  had  completed  the  study  31-03-241  for  patients  from  countries  in  which  aripiprazole  is 
currently unavailable through marketed means. 
Treatment period 
Each subject received daily aripiprazole at a dose between 5 and 30 mg established in the study 31-03-
241.  However,  modifications  to  the  daily  dose  could  be  made  at  the  investigator’s  discretion,  if 
clinically warranted.  
Following the Baseline visit, there are four study visits during the first year of treatment, three visits 
during the second year, and twice a year thereafter. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy  and  other  outcome  measures  were  summarised  as  changes  from  baseline  using  descriptive 
statistics. 
Efficacy Outcome Measures 
A  Clinical  Global  Impression-Severity  (CGI-S)  Scale  is  collected  to  assess  the  continuation  of 
therapeutic  benefit  of  the  aripiprazole  treatment  for  the  adolescent  subject.  The  CGI-S  score  is 
summarized over time. 
The Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-QLES-Q) is administered 
in translated languages when available. 
RESULTS 
Patient distribution 
As  of  this  date,  a  total  of  85 patients  have  been  included  in  this  study.  Of  85  subjects  included,  10 
(11.8%)  discontinued  the  study  prematurely  and  the  remaining  75  (88.2%)  are  ongoing.  Among  the 
Page 14 of 30

discontinuations, 4 (4.7%) withdrew for adverse events, 3 (3.5%) met withdrawal criteria (aripiprazole 
became  commercially  available  for  2  subjects  and  one  had  a  positive  drug  screen  for  cocaine),  2 
(2.4%) withdrew consent, and 1 (1.2%) withdrew for lack of efficacy. 
Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) 
Paired  data  for  change  from  baseline  in  CGI-S  were  available  for  82,  69,  26,  and  3 subjects  at 
Months 3, 6, 9, and 12, respectively . Mean scores for CGI-S ranged from 2.26 at Month 3 to 1.67 at 
Month 12. These values represented decreases from baseline at each timepoint evaluated (range −0.11 
at Month 3 to −0.67 at Month 12), indicating maintenance of efficacy with aripiprazole treatment. The 
analysis at the last visit which included data from subjects who discontinued prematurely also showed 
maintenance of efficacy.  
Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-QLES-Q) 
Paired values for P-QLES-Q, a quality of life outcome that was assessed semi-annually, were available 
for  66  (total  score)  and  68 subjects  (overall  score)  at  Month 6,  but  only  3  subjects  at  Month 12. 
Summary data from the last scheduled visit which included ongoing and withdrawn subjects showed 
little change  from baseline, indicating that efficacy was  maintained for up to  one year in this study. 
The  overall  rating  of  3.82  on  the  P-QLES-Q  indicated  that  on  average  the  subjects’  quality  of  life, 
enjoyment, and satisfaction were better than fair and approaching good at the last visit. 
  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Results  from  study  31-03-239,  a  large  randomised  controlled  trial  conducted  in  adolescents,  with  a 
mean age around 15, showed that aripiprazole was effective in the treatment of schizophrenia in this 
target  population  at  daily  doses  of  10 mg  and  30 mg,  as  demonstrated  by  statistically  significant 
improvements  compared  with  placebo  in  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  PANSS  Total  Score  at 
Week 6 (LOCF). 
Aripiprazole  10 mg  and  30 mg  were  effective  at  Week 6  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in 
adolescents  based  on  statistically  significant  improvements  compared  with  placebo  in  secondary 
efficacy  endpoints  (LOCF)  that  included  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  Positive  Subscale  Score, 
CGAS Score, and CGI-Severity Score, and mean CGI-Improvement Score. 
However,  the  CHMP  was  concerned  about  the  studied  population  which  may not  have  reflected  the 
characteristics of the European population, given that study 31-03-239 was performed in a number of 
non  European  countries. Following detailed  analysis  provided by the  MAH  on  the  characteristics  of 
the  studied  population,  the  CHMP  was  particularly  reassured  that  the  percentage  of  previous 
antipsychotic medication in study 31-03-239 was similar to that observed in adolescent patients being 
treated in Europe for the same condition. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  raised  a  major  concern  related  to  the  size  of  the  treatment  effect  in 
comparison  with  that  observed  in  the  adult  population.  Also,  data  on  remission  rates  were  collected 
from a post-hoc analysis, which questioned the clinical relevance of these results. 
To  address  these  concerns,  the  MAH  performed  2  comparative  analyses  of  results  according  to 
original  and  post-hoc  statistical  analyses,  respectively.  The  first  analysis  showed  that  the  95% 
confidence  interval  for  the  treatment  difference  between  aripiprazole  and  placebo  for  the  paediatric 
study (31-03-239) and adult study (CN-138-001) were overlapping. The range of the effect size was 
rather similar between these two populations. The 7 point (point estimate value) observed for the 30 
mg  dose  arm  in  the  adolescent  Study  31-03-239  falls  well  within  the  95%  confidence  intervals 
observed  for  the  adult  Study  CN-138-001.  The  second  analysis  showed  that  the  standardized 
difference  for  treatment  differences  from  placebo  (effect  size)  for  mean  change  from  baseline  in 
PANSS Total score between the 30 mg aripiprazole  and placebo groups in the paediatric population 
was similar to that of adults dosed at 10, 15, and 20 mg/day.

The  MAH  also  emphasized  that  there  is  a  clear  trend  of  improvement  over  the  time  course  of  the 
adolescent  trial  confirming  a  positive  drug  effect  for  both  10 mg  and  30 mg  aripirazole  doses.  The 
treatment  effect  was  consistent  as  shown  by  the  steady  progression  of  improvement  observed  in  all 
outcome  measures  (PANSS  total  score,  PANSS  positive  symptoms  subscale  and  CGI  Improvement 
score) as compared to placebo from Weeks 3-6. This was noted in both the 10 mg and 30 mg arms. 
On the basis of the above and despite data on remission rates were collected as post-hoc analysis, the 
CHMP  considered  that  overall,  the  short-term  efficacy  results  could  support  the  proposed paediatric 
indication. 
With  respect  to  the  long-term  data,  only  open  label  studies  were  performed.  The  lack  of  active 
comparator and the open label design make the results of the submitted extension studies difficult to 
interpret. 
In light of these concerns, the CHMP requested the PDCO to discuss whether a study with long-term 
efficacy  data  for  aripiprazole  in  the  proposed  indication  would  be  required  and  the  feasibility  and 
value  of  a  randomised  controlled  withdrawal  trial  in  this  setting.  The  main  PDCO  conclusions  were 
the following: 
-  Efficacy  and  safety  data  for  antipsychotics  cannot  safely  be  extrapolated  between  different  age 
groups  (adult  versus.  different  paediatric  subgroups)  or  between  indications  (e.g.  schizophrenia  and 
bipolar), as susceptibility to primary and secondary pharmacodynamic effects may be different across 
age  groups  and  indications.  Therefore,  a  6  month  maintenance  study  in  adolescents  with 
schizophrenia,  and  an  8  week  duration  efficacy  study  in  adolescents  to  assess  the  effect  of  the 
treatment upon negative symptoms would be required.  Long-term safety data would also be required  
 -  Although  schizophrenia  is  considerably  rarer  in  adolescents  than  in  adults,  the  PDCO  considered 
that such studies are feasible.   
Subsequently,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG)  Central  Nervous 
System (with additional experts in child psychiatry) to discuss in further details the need for long-term 
efficacy  data  for  aripiprazole  in  the  proposed  paediatric  indication.  The  SAG  CNS  was  held  on  5 
February 2009 and the main conclusions were the following: 
-  In  general  terms  continuity  in  the  phenomenology  of  schizophrenia  is  recognised  across  ages. 
However  the  manifestations  of  disease  are  often  more  severe  with  a  worst  prognosis  and  disease 
appears less responsive to treatment in younger patients with respects to adults. 
-  Incidence  of  schizophrenia  rises  with  age.  No  specific  differences  are  observed  across  age  strata 
except the very rare observation of cases in the youngest individuals; schizophrenia is also very rare 
during pre-puberty. 
- The efficacy of antipsychotics on positive/negative symptoms is not different per se, nevertheless in 
relation  with  the  greater  severity  of  the  syndrome  more  variability  in  the  response  is  commonly 
observed in adolescents. Pharmacological benefits are not systematically different but less predictable 
in individual patients. 
- Linear correlation in the pharmacokinetic parameters is not considered appropriate for extrapolation  
of efficacy, since possible differences exist in terms of dopaminergic receptors density in the brain of 
adolescents  and  children  with  respect  to  adults.  Therefore  the  dosage  regimen  is  not  directly 
comparable in adolescents/children and adults. 
-  Ideally,  a  6-12  month  duration  efficacy  maintenance  study  versus  active  treatment  (best  available 
used  pharmacological  treatment)  is  also  recommended  to  completing  the  data  extrapolated  from 
relapse  prevention  randomised  clinical  trials  already  performed  in  adults.  Six  months  is  seen  as  a 
minimum duration to effectively capture relapses (which are becoming frequent after 5.5 months), and 
results observed over 12-month duration would be more relevant.

Having  considered  the  SAG  conclusions,  the  available  short-term  efficacy  results  and  further 
comparative  analyses  provided  with  the  adult  population  (e.g  in  a  sub-analysis  of  the  adolescent 
patients  between  the  ages  of  15  to  17  years,  representing  74%  of  the  total  enrolled  population, 
maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial and was similar to the 
long-term efficacy seen in adults), the CHMP considered that the extrapolation from the adult to the 
adolescent  populations  was  still  questionable,  although  it  was  expectable  that  the  older  adolescent 
group might be closer to the adult population. 
Whereas: 
The overall database on schizophrenia in children and adolescents is limited compared to the 
There is clinical experience with several antipsychotics regarding pharmacological treatment 
- 
adult population; 
- 
options, however, there is no established gold standard yet, 
- 
Poor  responding  to  treatment  resulting  in  worse  outcome  compared  to  adult  patients,  may 
make  extrapolation  of  data  of  the  adult  population  to  adolescents  and  children  difficult,  particularly 
with  regard  to  patients  with  first  episode  schizophrenia  or  symptoms  not  fulfilling  the  diagnostic 
criteria yet; 
The  CHMP  also  agreed  to  convene  a  follow  up  SAG  to  discuss  in  further  details  the  clinical 
requirements for development of medicinal products for the treatment of schizophrenia in children and 
adolescents. The SAG was held on 11 May 2009 and the main conclusions were the following: 
Short-term trials (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) are actually needed to prove 
- 
efficacy and safety of antipsychotics in the younger population. 
The  recommended  duration  is  6-8  weeks.  PANSS  can  be  used  to  assess  signs  and  symptoms  of 
schizophrenia in the paediatric population whether it is recognised this tool is not validated before the 
age  of  14  years.  Other  scales  may  equally  be  considered  to  assess  specific  dimensions  (negative 
symptoms),  if  adequate  validation  is  provided.  Co-morbidities  should  not  represent  a  systematic 
cause for exclusion. 
For the time being considering the lack of definitive clinical evidences the use of an active control 
(instead of placebo) is not recommended. 
- Phenomenology  of  schizophrenia  is  considered  as  a  continuum,  very  rare  in  children  (under  12 
years), where it usually comes with a severe prognosis but steadily more frequent after puberty and in 
late  adolescence  where  the  clinical  course  becomes  more  similar  to  the  young  adults,  without  any 
recognizable age threshold. 
-  Maintenance  of  efficacy  can  not  be  extrapolated  from  clinical  trials  conducted  in  adults  (often 
patients  with  chronic  forms  of  schizophrenia  are  already  in  their  40s)  to  children  and  or 
adolescents  (with  a  shorter  course  of  disease,  different  physiologic  status  and  possibly  different 
susceptibility to safety risks). 
There  is  noticeable  lack  of  information  on  the  natural  course  of  the  disease  in  the  paediatric 
population.  However the follow up SAG felt that a reasonable duration for maintenance studies is 12 
months.  
Definition  of  relapse  in  this  population  should  be  based  on  absolute  increase  of  PANSS  (possibly 
looking  to  the  most  specific  items)  rather  than  on  relative  worsening  of  total  score.  Superiority 
studies  are  not  ruled  out  however  the  randomised  withdrawal  design  versus  placebo  is  the  most 
informative methodology both in terms of maintenance of efficacy and for the evaluation of safety.  
While the follow up SAG recognised the difficulties in implementing long-term maintenance studies 
versus placebo arm, nevertheless in the lack of long term safety data it is considered equally risky to 
expose the adolescents to a product approved for the adults (because of risks of endocrine unbalance 
Page 17 of 30

or weight gain, or Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms, or cognitive problems among others) and the safety 
risks of the new drug could be easily underestimated versus the ones of the “active control(s)”.  
The follow up SAG recommended both treatment groups receive background better standard of care 
(like familial/behavioural therapy, cognitive rehabilitation programs) over 12 months. 
- 
The  follow  up  SAG  also  considered  that  no  golden  standard  is  available  (see  also  above) 
because  of  current  lack  of  controlled  clinical  data  in  the  paediatric  population.  Currently  each 
child/adolescent  psychiatry  department  mostly  follows  his  own  clinical  practice  largely  guided  by 
experience  with antipsychotics build in other indications and on safety considerations applied to the 
individual case. Low ineffective dosages may be used. Switch to clozapine or augmentation strategies 
are also applied in variable extent according to centres and country. 
During the oral explanation held on 20 July 2009, the MAH provided the following argumentation to 
support an indication in adolescents 15 years and older: 
- To address the CHMP concerns over the influence of sexual maturation on disease progression and 
responsiveness to treatment in adolescent patients with schizophrenia, particularly at pre-pubertal and 
pubertal  stages,  the  MAH  presented  data  indicating  similar  acute  and  long-term  efficacy  results 
compared to adults,  
- To address the validity of the extrapolation of long-term efficacy from adult data, adolescent patients 
(15-17  years,  from  study  31-03-239/241)  were  compared  to  a  subgroup  of  adult  patients  with  early 
episode of schizophrenia (from previous adult study 31-98-217/304), characterised by: age < 40 years 
and  shorter  duration  of  disease  i.e.  ≤  5  years  since  first  episode).  Results  showed  similar  baseline 
PANSS score of 95.0 and 93.4 for adults and adolescents, respectively and the percentage of patients 
with treatment response was comparable in these populations.  
Having considered the follow up SAG conclusions and the oral explanation provided by the MAH, the  
CHMP considered the proposed indication approvable provided that in terms of efficacy: 
-  The paediatric population is restricted to adolescents older than 15 year-old; 
-  Long-term study to further support the maintenance of the effect is performed by the MAH, as 
part of a post-authorisation commitment. 
In terms of the dosing recommendation, the MAH proposed to titrate aripiprazole with a starting dose 
of  2  mg  to  5 mg  after  2 days  and  to  the  target  dose  of  10 mg  after  two  additional  days.  Subsequent 
dose  increases  should  be  administered  in  5 mg  increments.  The  maximum  daily  dose  should  not 
exceed 30 mg. The CHMP acknowledges that the 2 mg dose is only available with the oral solution 
(1mg/ml) formulation and considered the proposed dosing recommendation acceptable. 
Clinical safety 
 
Patient exposure 
The safety sample comprised a total of 303 adolescent subjects with schizophrenia who were enrolled 
in five studies (CN138014, 31-03-238, 31-03-239, 31-03-241 and 31-05-243). Of these, 282 subjects 
were exposed to aripiprazole. 
In a pooled analysis from 3 phase III/IIIb studies (31-03-239,31-03-241 and 31-05-243), Seventy six 
subjects (27.0%) were exposed to aripiprazole for more than 52 weeks, and 3 subjects (1.1%) for more 
than 78 weeks. 
 
Adverse events 
Study CN138014 
A total of 132 AEs occurred; 48 in 17 (73.9% ) subjects in Phase A, and 84 in 17 (73.9%) subjects in 
Phase B. All of the events were of mild to moderate intensity.  Twenty-six TEAEs with no resolution

date  occurred  during  the  study  (6  events  in  6  subjects  during  Phase  A  and  20  events  in  13  subjects 
during Phase B). 
The AE profiles were generally similar in children and adolescents with most of the AEs occurring in 
the gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders system organ classes. 
There  were  8  subjects  (4  children  and  4  adolescents)  who  experienced  11  marked  laboratory 
abnormalities (MAs). One of these was reported as an AE. One child had an AE of increased hepatic 
enzymes  reported.  The  subject  had  elevations  in  both  ALAT  and  ASAT  that  were  considered  MAs. 
Other  MAs  included  an  additional  subject  with  increased  in  ALAT,  3  subjects  with  decreased 
hemoglobin,  2  subjects  with  increased  urinary  glucose,  and  1  subject  each  with  increased  alkaline 
phosphatase, uric acid and eosinophils. 
Study 31-03-238 
All 21 subjects enrolled reported at least one TEAE. The fewest number of TEAEs was reported in the 
Aripiprazole 30 mg cohort. No clear dose-related trends were observed. 
One  subject  (aripiprazole  25 mg  cohort)  experienced  a  TEAE  of  acute  dystonic  reaction,  considered 
by the investigator to be definitely related to aripiprazole.  
Study 31-03-239 
A  total  of  567  TEAEs  were  reported  by  202/302  (66.9%)  subjects  (see  Table  3).  The  percentage  of 
subjects who experienced at least one TEAE was slightly higher in the aripiprazole arms than in the 
placebo arm. A total of 188 TEAEs were experienced by 71/100 (71.0%) subjects in the aripiprazole 
10 mg arm; 232 TEAES were experienced by 74/102 (72.5%) subjects in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm; 
and 147 TEAEs were experienced by 57/100 (57.0%) subjects in the placebo arm. 
The majority of TEAEs in all treatment arms were mild to moderate in severity. A greater percentage 
of subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm experienced severe TEAEs (7/100, 7.0%) than did subjects 
in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (4/102, 3.9%) or subjects in the placebo arm (3/100, 3.0%).

There appeared to be a general trend of increasing incidence across the treatment groups for TEAEs of 
nausea, akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor, with the highest incidence in the 
aripiprazole 30 mg arm. 
There was 1 suicidal ideation event in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (1%), and 1 suicidal attempt and 1 
suicidal ideation (1% each) in the placebo arm. 
An overall low incidence of clinically significant hyperprolactinemia was observed in this study: 3% 
in the aripiprazole 10mg arm, 0% in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 6% in the placebo arm.  
The  incidences  of  low  prolactin  levels  were  8%,  34%,  and  26%,  respectively,  in  the  placebo, 
aripiprazole 10 mg, and aripiprazole 30 mg arms. 
There was no signal of increased abdominal obesity associated with aripiprazole in this study.  
No clinically meaningful changes were observed in the overall evaluation of metabolic parameters. 
Study 31-03-241 
A  total  of  499  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  165/239  (69.0%)  of  the  subpopulation  of  subjects  with 
schizophrenia.  The  most  common  TEAEs  reported  at  an  incidence  of  ≥ 5%  in  the  subpopulation  of 
adolescents with schizophrenia were extrapyramidal disorder (19.2%), somnolence (13.8%), insomnia 
(9.2%),  akathisia  (8.4%),  weight  increased  (7.9%),  headache  (7.1%),  nausea  (6.7%),  tremor  (6.3%), 
vomiting (5.9%), nasopharyngitis (5.9%), and increased appetite (5.4%). 
Overall, EPS-related AEs were observed in 63/239 (26.3%) adolescent with schizophrenia.  
Only 1 (0.3%) case of suicidal ideation was reported. 
No  clinically  relevant  transaminase  elevations  or  changes  in  hematology  parameters  were  noted  in 
adolescents with schizophrenia.  
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  mean  QT  or  QTc  intervals,  or  other  ECG  abnormalities,  were 
observed following long-term treatment with aripiprazole. 
In  adolescent  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  at  the  Last  Visit,  the  percentage  of  subjects  who 
experienced a potentially clinically significant weight gain (defined as ≥ 7% weight gain compared to 
baseline) was 24.5%; 4.6% of subjects experienced a weight loss of ≥ 7% relative to baseline.  
Study 31-05-243 
At least one TEAE was reported by 48.2% of subjects receiving long-term treatment with aripiprazole. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  (≥  5%  of  subjects),  irrespective  of  causality,  were  influenza  (7.1%)  and 
vomiting  (5.9%).  Extrapyramidal  and  akathisia  events  were  reported  by  5.8%  and  2.3%  of  subjects, 
respectively.

No clinically meaningful changes in mean QTc intervals were evident in this sample population. 
At the last visit, the percentage of subjects who experienced a potentially clinically significant weight 
gain  (defined  as  ≥  7%  weight  gain  compared  to  baseline)  was  12.7%;  whereas,  7.0%  of  subjects 
experienced a weight loss of ≥ 7% relative to baseline.  
There was no signal of increased abdominal obesity associated with aripiprazole. 
 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
One  death  was  reported  in  study  31-03-241  in  an  adolescent  with  schizophrenia.  The  event  was  an 
accidental  electrocution  (PT  electrocution,  SOC  Injury,  Poisoning  and  Procedural  Complications), 
which was not attributed to study drug by the investigator.  
There were no SAEs reported in pharmacokinetic studies 31-03-238 and CN138014.  
Study 31-03-239 
The  percentage  of  subjects  who  experienced  SAEs  was  similar  across  the  3  treatment  arms:  4/100 
(4.0%) and 4/102 (3.9%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively, and 3/100 (3.0%) in 
the placebo arm. 
The most commonly reported SAEs overall were psychotic disorder (3 subjects, 1 in each treatment 
arm) and schizophrenia (2 subjects, 1 in each aripiprazole treatment arm).  
In the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, the following SAEs were reported by 1 subject each in the aripiprazole 
10 mg arm: extrapyramidal disorder, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, aggression, psychotic 
disorder, schizophrenia, and thrombophlebitis.  
In  the  aripiprazole  30 mg  arm,  the  following  SAEs  were  reported  by  1  subject  each:  varicella, 
depression, psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, and suicidal ideation.  
In  the  placebo  arm,  intentional  overdose,  overdose,  psychotic  disorder,  and  suicide  attempt  were 
reported by 1 subject each. 
Study 31-03-24 
A total of 14/239 (5.9%) subjects with schizophrenia experienced SAEs. The majority of these SAEs 
were severe in intensity.  
The  following  SAEs  were  reported  by  1  subject  each:  acute  bronchitis,  hepatitis  A,  electrocution, 
intentional overdose, acute psychosis, auditory hallucination, homicidal ideation, impulsive behavior, 
intentional self-injury, and suicidal ideation.  
Overall, 5 subjects with schizophrenia reported SAEs resulting in premature discontinuation of study 
medication:  psychotic  disorder  (n=2),  electrocution  (n=1),  acute  psychosis  (n=1),  and  auditory 
hallucination (n=1).  
Study 31-05-243 
Overall,  5  (5.9%)  subjects  experienced  SAEs  during  the  study.  Suicide  attempt  was  reported  by  2 
subjects, considered unrelated or not likely to be related to study medication.  
One subject experienced severe psychomotor hyperactivity and aggression that were both classified as 
serious.  The  remaining  SAEs  reported  by  one  subject  each  were  ligament  injury  and  worsening  of 
schizophrenia.

  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study CN138014 
No subjects prematurely discontinued due to AEs. 
Study 31-03-238 
One subject, an 11-year-old black male with a psychiatric history of schizophrenia in the aripiprazole 
25 mg cohort withdrew from the study because of an AE of moderate dystonia that was considered by 
the investigator to be definitely related to the study medication. 
Study 31-03-239 
A  total  of  13/302  (4.3%)  subjects  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  TEAEs.  The  percentage  of 
subjects who discontinued study medication due to TEAEs was greater in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm 
(7/100, 7.0%) than in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (4/102; 3.9%) or the placebo arm (2/100, 2.0%). 
The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  study  medication  (reported  by 
more  than  1  subject  overall)  were  psychotic  disorder  (1  subject  in  each  treatment  arm)  and 
schizophrenia (2 subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm and 1 subject in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm).  
Study 31-03-241 
A  total  of  6/239  (2.5%)  subjects  with  schizophrenia  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  AEs.  
The majority of these AEs were moderate to severe in intensity. The reasons for discontinuation were 
leukopenia,  electrocution,  acute  psychosis  and  auditory  hallucination  in  one  subject  each  (0.4%),  as 
well as psychotic disorder in 2 subjects (0.8%). 
Study 31-05-243 
Four subjects (4.7%) discontinued study medication due to SAEs: suicide attempt (2 subjects), 
aggression (1 subject), and schizophrenia (1 subject). 
 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  from  the  five  clinical  studies  conducted  in  children  and  adolescent  populations 
appeared to be similar to the one observed in the adult population. 
In  the  short-term  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial  involving  302  adolescents  (13-17  years)  with 
schizophrenia, the frequency and nature of undesirable effects were similar to those in adults except 
for the following events that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than 
in  adults  receiving  aripiprazole  (and  more  frequently  than  placebo):  somnolence/sedation  and 
extrapyramidal  disorders  were  reported  very  commonly,  and  dry  mouth,  increased  appetite,  and 
orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  lack  of  long  term  data  do  not  allow  to  make  any  conclusions, 
particularly  for  the  high  rate  of  EPS  symptoms  and  of  weight  gain  and  the  effects  on  sexual 
maturation,  growth,  metabolism  and  suicidality,  that  have  been  identified  as  concerns  for  other 
antipsychotics. 
The MAH argued that on the basis of available paediatric data (studies 31-03-239 and 31-03-241) for 
aripiprazole, there is no increased reporting of EPS in comparison to other atypical antipsychotics nor 
a high rate of weight gain associated with aripiprazole. Furthermore, the MAH considered that there 
were no signals observed in clinical trials indicating an increased risk for suicidality with aripiprazole 
treatment.

The long-term open-label study 31-05-243 is ongoing. An interim analysis with a clinical data cut-off 
date of 1 June 2008 has been conducted to provide data on growth and sexual maturation. On the basis 
of  this  analysis  and  data  from  study  31-03-239,  the  MAH  concluded  that  there  is  no  signal  of  a 
negative influence of aripiprazole on growth or sexual maturation in adolescent patients. 
However,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  further  proactive  data  should  be  collected  for  the 
following safety concerns: EPS symptoms, weight gain, suicidality, growth and sexual maturation.  
At  the  SAG  CNS  meeting  held  on  5  February  2009,  the  experts  were  also  requested  to  discuss  the 
main  safety  concerns  identified  with  antipsychotics  intended  to  be  used  in  the  treatment  of 
schizophrenia  in  the  adolescent  population  in  the  context  of  long  term  safety  and  concluded  the 
following: 
- Considering long term safety, 2 to 5-year observational studies are viewed as clinically meaningful to 
allow adequate collection of clinical data in adolescents on cognition (developmental aspects), social 
adjustment,  suicidality,  sexual  maturation,  weight  gain  and  metabolic  adverse  effects,  as  well  as  on 
EPS/akathisia. 
At the follow up SAG held on 11 May 2009, the experts considered that: 
- Pre-authorisation long-term safety studies should address at least the most important (suicidality) or 
most  common  (EPS,  weight  gain,  amenorrhea)  or  most  specific  (impact  on  cognition,  memory, 
executive functions) safety risks. These will not exclude a comprehensive appraisal of rare situations 
via post-marketing studies in the frame of the Risk Management Plan. 
-  Reasonable  study  duration  is  estimated  2-year.  For  the  assessment  of  adverse  effects  for  which 
signals  have  been  caught  (see  above)  it  is  critical  that  specific  studies  are  implemented.    It  was 
mentioned that collected data could be also analysed versus healthy controls cohorts.  
To assess suicidality, a well identified and meaningful risk in the adolescent age group, the Columbia 
University scale and questionnaire can be used but other validated tools may be considered.  
Finally,  for  cognitive  impact,  if  on  one  hand  the  current  knowledge  does  not  allow  to  ask  for 
predefined  improvements  in  cognitive  domains,  on  the  other  hand  the  Experts  agreed  that  possible 
deterioration should also be investigated. If a specific cognitive improvement is expected this should 
adequately investigated. 
Taking into consideration the SAG conclusions, the CHMP recommended that the prospective safety 
data should cover a minimum period of 2 years. The CHMP also recognised that there are risks that 
although important are extremely difficult to be evaluated in practice like the impact in cognition for 
example. 
Following the CHMP’s view, the MAH agreed to conduct a number of pooled analysis from paediatric 
placebo-controlled completed studies and from ongoing studies (as post authorisation commitments) 
to further investigate these concerns, as follows: 
- a pooled analysis on prolactin levels, height, weight, lipid parameters, glucose, insulin and ECGs of 
the following studies performed in adolescent schizophrenia patients (13-17 years) for up to two years: 
31-03-239, 31-03-241 and 31-05-243; 
- a pooled analysis on prolactin levels, height, weight, lipid parameters, glucose, insulin and ECGs of 
the  studies  performed  in  children  and  adolescents  (10-17 years)  with  bipolar I  disorder  for  up  to  32 
weeks: 31-03-240 and 31-03-241; 
- data analysis on prolactin levels, height, weight, lipid parameters, glucose, insulin, ECGs and Tanner 
staging for study CN138-180 conducted in children and adolescents (6-17 years) with autistic disorder 
for up to 1 year. 
In accordance with the updated RMP, prospective safety data will be collected over 2-years exposure 
in adolescent schizophrenia patients (13-17 years). 
Page 23 of 30 
  © EMEA 2009 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  also  agreed  to  conduct  an  epidemiologic  cohort  study  to  assess  suicide  in 
adolescent patients using aripiprazole as post-authorisation commitment. 
Having  considered  the  above,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  proposed  follow  up  measures  were 
adequate to ensure a safe use of the product in the proposed new indication.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome 
(NMS): NMS is a potentially fatal 
symptom complex associated with 
antipsychotic medicinal products. In 
clinical trials, rare cases of NMS 
were reported during treatment with 
aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of 
NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle 
rigidity, altered mental status and 
evidence of autonomic instability 
(irregular pulse or blood pressure, 
tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac 
dysrhythmia). Additional signs may

include elevated creatine 
phosphokinase, myoglobinuria 
(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal 
failure. However, elevated creatine 
phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, 
not necessarily in association with 
NMS, have also been reported. If a 
patient develops signs and 
symptoms indicative of NMS, or 
presents with unexplained high fever 
without additional clinical 
manifestations of NMS, all 
antipsychotic medicinal products, 
including ABILIFY, must be 
discontinued." 
Warnings & Precautions, section 4.4 
of SPC: 
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon 
cases of seizure were reported during 
treatment with aripiprazole. Therefore, 
aripiprazole should be used with 
caution in patients who have a 
history of seizure disorder or have 
conditions associated with seizures." 
Warnings & Precautions, section 4.4 
of SPC: 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus: 
hyperglycaemia, in some cases 
extreme and associated with 
ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar 
coma or death, has been reported in 
patients treated with atypical 
antipsychotic agents, including 
ABILIFY. Risk factors that may 
predispose patients to severe 
complications include obesity and 
family history of diabetes. 
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, 
there were no significant differences in 
the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-
related adverse reactions (including 
diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia 
laboratory values compared to 
placebo. Precise risk estimates for 
hyperglycaemia-related adverse 
reactions in patients treated with 
ABILIFY and with other atypical 
antipsychotic agents are not available 
to allow direct comparisons. Patients 
treated with any antipsychotic agents, 
including ABILIFY, should be 
observed for signs and symptoms of 
hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, 
polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) 
and patients with diabetes mellitus or 
with risk factors for diabetes mellitus 
should be monitored regularly for 
worsening of glucose control.

Pregnancy and lactation, section 4.6 of 
SPC: 
There are no adequate and well-
controlled trials of aripiprazole in 
pregnant women. Congenital 
anomalies have been reported; 
however, causal relationship with 
aripiprazole could not be established. 
Animal studies could not exclude 
potential developmental toxicity 
(see section 5.3). Patients should be 
advised to notify their physician if they 
become pregnant or intend to become 
pregnant during treatment with 
aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety 
information in humans and concerns 
raised by animal reproductive studies, 
this medicinal product should not be 
used in pregnancy unless the expected 
benefit clearly justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk 
of treated rats during lactation. It is not 
known whether aripiprazole is 
excreted in human milk. Patients 
should be advised not to breastfeed if 
they are taking aripiprazole."

Cardiovascular disorders: Aripiprazole 
should be used with caution in patients 
with known cardiovascular disease 
(history of myocardial infarction or 
ischaemic heart disease, heart 
failure, or conduction abnormalities), 
cerebrovascular disease, conditions 
which would predispose patients to 
hypotension (dehydration, 
hypovolemia, and treatment with 
antihypertensive medicinal products) 
or hypertension, including accelerated 
or malignant. 
Warnings & Precautions, section 4.4 
of SPC: 
Conduction abnormalities: In clinical 
trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of 
QT prolongation was comparable to 
placebo. As with other antipsychotics, 
aripiprazole should be used with 
caution in patients with a family 
history of QT prolongation. 
Warnings & Precautions, section 4.4 
of SPC: 
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly 
seen in schizophrenic and bipolar 
mania patients due to co-morbidities, 
use of antipsychotics known to 
cause weight gain, poorly managed 
life-style, and might lead to severe 
complications. Weight gain has been 
reported post-marketing among 
patients prescribed ABILIFY. When 
seen, it is usually in those with 
significant risk factors such as history 
of diabetes, thyroid disorder or 
pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials 
aripiprazole has not been shown to 
induce clinically relevant weight gain 
(see section 5.1)."

patients with psychosis associated with 
Alzheimer's disease, patients treated 
with aripiprazole were at increased 
risk of death compared to placebo. The 
rate of death in aripiprazole-treated 
patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% 
in the placebo group. Although the 
causes of deaths were varied, most of 
the deaths appeared to be either 
cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, 
sudden death) or infectious (e.g. 
pneumonia) in nature. Cerebrovascular 
adverse reactions: in the same 
trials, cerebrovascular adverse 
reactions (e.g. stroke, transient

1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients 
reported cerebrovascular adverse 
reactions compared with 0.6% of 
placebo-treated patients in these 
trials. This difference was not 
statistically significant. However, in 
one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, 
there was a significant dose response

5.  User Consultation 
The  MAH  referred  to  the  Readability  Testing  of  the  aripiprazole  tablets  Package  Leaflet  (PL) 
conducted during the assessment of the initial marketing authorisation application.  
The  MAH  considered  that  the  key  safety  information  differences  concerns  adverse  drug  reactions 
already  listed  in  the  PL  and  that  the  layout  is  not  significantly  changed.  This  justification  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
6.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk assessment 
Results  from  study  31-03-239,  a  large  randomised  controlled  trial  conducted  in  adolescents,  with  a 
mean age around 15, showed that aripiprazole was effective in the treatment of schizophrenia in this 
target  population  at  daily  doses  of  10 mg  and  30 mg,  as  demonstrated  by  statistically  significant 
improvements  compared  with  placebo  in  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  PANSS  Total  Score  at 
Week 6 (LOCF). 
Aripiprazole  10 mg  and  30 mg  were  effective  at  Week 6  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in 
adolescents  based  on  statistically  significant  improvements  compared  with  placebo  in  secondary 
efficacy  endpoints  (LOCF)  that  included  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  Positive  Subscale  Score, 
CGAS Score, and CGI-Severity Score, and mean CGI-Improvement Score. 
With  respect  to  the  long-term  data,  only  open  label  studies  were  performed.  The  lack  of  active 
comparator and the open label design make the results of the submitted extension studies difficult to 
interpret.  
Having requested several experts’ views on these concerns, the CHMP considered that extrapolation 
from the adult to the adolescent population was still questionable, although it was expectable that the 
older adolescent group might be closer to the adult population.

At  the  oral  explanation  held  on  20  July  2009,  the  MAH  presented  adolescent  data  (15-17  years) 
indicating similar acute and long-term efficacy results compared to adults. In addition, to address the 
validity  of  the  extrapolation  of  long-term  efficacy  from  adult  data,  the  MAH  provided  comparative 
analysis between a subgroup of adult patients, with early episode of schizophrenia (characterised by: 
age  <  40  years  and  shorter  duration  of  disease  i.e.  ≤  5  years  since  first  episode)  showing  similar 
baseline PANSS score of 95.0 and 93.4 for adults and adolescents, respectively and the percentage of 
patients with treatment response was comparable in these populations.  
On  the  other  hand,  the  safety  profile  from  the  five  clinical  studies  conducted  in  children  and 
adolescent populations appeared to be similar to the one observed in the adult population. However, 
the  CHMP  considered  that  the  lack  of  long  term  data  do  not  allow  to  make  any  conclusions, 
particularly  for  the  high  rate  of  EPS  symptoms  and  of  weight  gain  and  the  effects  on  sexual 
maturation,  growth,  metabolism  and  suicidality,  that  have  been  identified  as  concerns  for  other 
antipsychotics. 
Having  requested  several  experts’  views  on  these  concerns,  the  CHMP  considered  that  further 
proactive  data  should  be  collected  in  terms  of  safety  concerns  (e.g  EPS  symptoms,  weight  gain, 
suicidality, growth and sexual maturation) and recommended that the prospective safety data should 
cover a minimum period of 2 years.  
Following the CHMP’s view, the MAH agreed to conduct a number of pooled analysis from paediatric 
placebo-controlled completed studies and from ongoing studies (as post authorisation commitments) 
to  further  investigate  these  concerns.  In  addition,  in  accordance  with  the  updated  RMP,  prospective 
safety data will be collected over 2-years exposure in adolescent schizophrenia patients (13-17 years). 
To  specifically  address  the  concern  over  suicidality,  the  MAH  agreed  to  conduct  an  epidemiologic 
cohort  study  to  assess  suicide  in  adolescent  patients  using  aripiprazole  as  post-authorisation 
commitment. 
Having considered the above, the CHMP considered the proposed indication approvable provided that: 
-  The paediatric population is restricted to adolescents older than 15 year-old; 
-  Long-term efficacy and safety studies to further support the maintenance of the effect and to 
better characterise the safety profile in the adolescent population are performed by the MAH, 
as part of post-authorisation commitments. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the benefit risk assessment of Abilify in the proposed indication 
(new  text=  underlined),  “ABILIFY  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adults  and  in 
adolescents  15  years  and  older.”  is  positive  and  recommended  by  majority,  the  variation  to  the 
Marketing Authorisation, subject to post-authorisation commitments related to long term efficacy and 
safety.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this Extension Application is to register Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml solution for 
(intraperitoneal) infusion. Insuman already has the following approved formulations which are 
solutions or suspensions for injection, with strengths of 40 or 100 IU/ml: Insuman Rapid, Comb 15, 
Comb 25, Comb 30, Comb 50, Basal and Infusat. These formulations are intended for subcutaneous 
use (the Rapid formulation may also be administered intravenously). 
The Applicant aligned the remaining Insuman presentations with the latest QRD template, version 9, in 
this line extension procedure. 
Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml (solution for infusion in a vial) was developed to replace Insuplant 
400 IU/ml (French national registration °1998, MAH Prostrakan Pharma).   
Both Insuman Implantable and Insuplant have the same formulation. The only difference between 
these two drug products is the source of the human insulin used. The active substance in Insuman is 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 7/79 
 
 
 
 
human insulin produced via recombinant DNA technology in E. coli, while the human insulin used in the 
manufacture of Insuplant is insulin derived from enzymatic modification of porcine insulin. 
The manufacturing of this porcine-derived insulin was recently stopped. The recombinant human 
insulin Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL was developed as a replacement therapy for Insuplant and is 
currently the only insulin available which can be used with the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump 
(MIP) for continuous intra-peritoneal insulin infusion (CIPII). The pump is implanted between the 
subcutaneous abdominal tissue and the abdominal muscle and delivers insulin from a reservoir through 
a catheter into the peritoneal cavity. Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml is delivered by a continuous 
infusion at a basal rate with the remaining 40 – 60% as boluses divided between the three main 
meals. The reservoir is filled (and re-filled) with Insuman 400 IU/ml by trained healthcare personnel in 
hospital using aseptic procedures. Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL has to be used under restricted 
medical prescription, in hospital only and in specialized units. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The extension of the Marketing Authorisation concerns a new route of administration (intraperitoneal 
use) associated with a new strength (400 IU/mL) and a new pharmaceutical form (solution for 
infusion). Insuman Implantable 400 UI/ml solution for infusion has been specifically formulated for use 
with a Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump (MIP). The implantable Medtronic MiniMed intraperitoneal 
insulin pump is a CE marked medical device, however there is a current procedure on going at the 
Notified Body (GMED) in order to update the CE mark (please refer to section 2.2.6). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Insulin human (HR1799) is manufactured from a fusion protein produced by an Escherichia coli strain 
that has been genetically modified with a corresponding recombinant plasmid. This fusion protein 
contains human proinsulin linked to an E. coli polypeptide. Insulin HR 1799 is delivered from this 
precursor by a multi-step procedure, including enzymatic cleavage, followed by rigorous purification. 
Insulin HR 1799 (human insulin of rDNA origin) is a white to almost white powder practically insoluble 
in water, soluble in diluted mineral acids and sensitive to light. 
No further data was provided regarding the active substance for this line extension application as the 
active substance has been approved for manufacturing finished product preparations for subcutaneous 
and intravenous use. The active substance used in this formulation is of the same quality as that used 
for the manufacture of the already approved Insuman, thus no new information or assessment is 
required.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Insuman Implantable 400 UI/ml solution for infusion is a sterile neutral solution supplied in 10 ml 
single dose containers. The colourless type I glass vials are closed with a flanged cap made of 
aluminium with tear-off lid and inserted sealing disk made of chlorobutyl rubber. Details and 
specifications for the vial, stoppers and seals have been provided and are satisfactory. 
The solution is only for use with the Medtronic implantable pump for intraperitoneal delivery. At each 
refill of the implanted pump, insulin human 400 IU/mL solution for infusion is transferred into the 
pump reservoir using the sterile refill syringe and needle provided. The refill is performed at hospital 
under aseptic conditions and the procedure is described in detail in the Pump Manual.

Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 8/79 
 
 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is a neutral buffered solution (pH 7.5) of insulin HR1799, stabilized with 
polyethylene-polypropylene glycol (poloxamer 171). The neutral pH was chosen to have an optimum 
local tolerability of the preparation. The formulation contains phenol as an antimicrobial preservative 
and Trometamol as a buffering agent to stabilize the pH at 7.5. 
The excipients were chosen taking into account compatibility with insulin, stability, local tolerance and 
manufacturing process.  
All the excipients are described in the European Pharmacopoeia, except Poloxamer 171 which is a non-
compendial excipient. Additional requirements for microbiological purity and bacterial endotoxins have 
been included.  The specifications proposed for Poloxamer 171 are satisfactory and the methods can be 
considered as suitably validated. 
Insulin human 400 IU/ml solution for infusion should not be mixed with other products. The solution 
can only be in contact with the buffer solution, (a placebo solution comprising the excipients minus 
insulin and zinc chloride) used as shipping fluid and rinsing buffer. Medtronic MiniMed Implantable 
pumps are shipped with shipping fluid inside the pump reservoir. During the first implant, the pump is 
emptied and rinsed with Insulin human 400 IU/ml solution for infusion and then filled for use. Any 
trace of shipping fluid / rinse buffer left in the pump will not be incompatible with Insuman 
Implantable.  
The information provided on pharmaceutical development is considered satisfactory and the applicant 
adequately outlined the criticalities of the finished product. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal derived material are used in the manufacture of this medicinal 
product. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is based on conventional dissolving, mixing, pH-adjustment, filtration, 
filling and packaging techniques. Since the product is heat labile the sterility is ensured by sterile 
filtration and aseptic filling. Appropriate controls are in place. 
The content of the vial is intended to be transferred aseptically to the reservoir of the implanted pump. 
Although the (re-)filling procedure of the pump is performed in hospital under aseptic conditions, 
phenol was added to the formulation as antimicrobial preservative in order to provide microbial 
protection in case of accidental contamination during transfer. 
The preserving properties of the formulation are sufficiently supported by the preservative efficacy 
testing also covering an in-use period of 45 days. 
Validation results have been provided for three consecutive production scale batches manufactured 
with three different active substance batches. Results of process controls and of final quality controls of 
three consecutive production scale batches were reviewed and assessed.  
The manufacturing process is sufficiently described and the validation data demonstrate that the 
process is reproducible and capable, within its specified design parameters, of consistently producing a 
finished product of the required quality. The assay results obtained during manufacture and filling 
indicate that the solution is stable during preparation and filling.

Product specification 
The control of finished product is ascertained by suitable specification tests and limits. The limits are 
well in line with pharmacopoeial requirements and have been appropriately justified. The analytical 
methods have been adequately validated and, where relevant, are compliant with Ph. Eur. 
requirements.  
Batch analyses data from three consecutive production scale batches of insulin human solution for 
infusion have been provided. All batches met the acceptance criteria.  
Stability of the product 
The stability of the finished product was studied with three full scale batches stored for 24 months at 
long-term conditions (+5 ± 3°C), for 6 months at accelerated conditions (+25 ± 2°C/60% ± 5%RH) 
and for 8 weeks under stress conditions (+37 ± 2°C).  A photostability study was also performed on 
one batch exposed for 1 day to artificial sunlight.  Vials were stored in an inverted position.   
Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months for the finished product when stored 
at 2-8°C, protected from light is considered acceptable.  
To support the prescribed use of Insuman in combination with the pump the following information has 
been provided: 
- in-use in vitro stability study 
- analysis of in vivo samples (analysis of solutions recovered from the pump reservoir before a refill) 
The provided data shows that insulin solution is stable during the 45-day in-use period in the pump. 
The data also indicate that the NaOH rinse procedure is suitable to prevent pump blockage by fibril 
formation.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Information on composition, pharmaceutical development and manufacture has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner.  
The manufacturing process is well described. It was demonstrated that the manufacturing process of 
Insulin Implantable is capable, within its specified design parameters, of consistently producing a 
finished product of required quality. 
The in-process control (IPC) tests are described and deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring the 
manufacturing process. 
Overall, the finished product is well controlled. The list of specification tests, their limits and 
justifications, the validation of the methods as well as the characterization of impurities are considered 
appropriate.   
The provided information on the reference standards is satisfactory. The packaging materials are 
suitably described and comply with the relevant requirements. The shelf-life and storage conditions as 
proposed by the applicant are acceptable. 
Insuman Implantable can only be used with the Medtronic implantable pump. The tests performed to 
demonstrate the suitability and compatibility of the pump with the Insuman implantable solution are 
adequately described.

To guarantee insulin solution stability and to prevent pump blockage, a refill cycle of 45 days is 
recommended together with a monitoring of the stroke volume. In addition, a sodium hydroxide rinse 
procedure should be performed every 6 months or when stroke delivery accuracy falls below the 
acceptance criterion. The sodium hydroxide rinse procedure performed under these conditions was 
demonstrated to be appropriate to prevent pump blockage by fibril formation. 
The rinsing sodium hydroxide solution composition is provided. It is classified and registered as a 
medical device. The EC Certificate has been provided together with the EC Certificates of the pump.  
The initial septum study/inlet valve assembly testing for absence of leakage was designed to 
demonstrate a 5-year of service with less frequent refill and rinse procedures than the currently 
proposed schedule.  
To take into account the modified shortened refill (45 days) and rinse cycles (every 6 months) as well 
as the extended battery life (7 years), the applicant has started a study to demonstrate septum/inlet 
valve integrity and absence of leakage. The presented protocol ETP13-5469 is considered acceptable. 
The purpose of this protocol is to define the procedure and test conditions to verify the functional 
reliability of the MIP Inlet Assembly through the expected life conditions, including manufacturing and 
service life.  
The CHMP recommends the applicant to provide results of the study and to modify the shelf-life of the 
pump if necessary.  
The applicant submitted a change to the notified body (LNE/G-MED) to extend the use of Medtronic 
MiniMed Implantable Infusion Pump with rDNA human insulin and to align the physician manual with 
Insuman 400 IU/ml SmPC (refill cycle and rinsing procedure). Currently it is under evaluation by 
LNE/G-MED and their feedback is expected in September 2013. The applicant is recommended to 
provide the outcome from the evaluation carried out by LNE/G-MED to the CHMP. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Overall, information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency 
and uniformity of important quality characteristics.  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.  
Based on the submitted data, the application for Insuman Implantable is recommended for approval 
based on quality grounds.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. 
 The CHMP recommends the applicant to provide results of the study to demonstrate septum/inlet 
valve integrity and absence of leakage (protocol ETP13-5469) and to modify the shelf-life of the 
pump if necessary.  
2.  The applicant is recommended to provide the outcome from the evaluation carried out by the 
notified body (LNE/G-MED) regarding the change to extent the use of the Medtronic MiniMed 
Implantable Infusion Pump with rDNA human insulin and to align the physician manual with 
Insuman 400 IU/ml SmPC (refill cycle and rinsing procedure) once available.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant provided the study reports of four non-clinical studies which were conducted in 
compliance with GLP regulations. In addition, the results of two non-GLP studies were submitted and 
described in the non-clinical overview and summaries. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In a rabbit study it was shown that formulations of recombinant human insulin (100 IU/mL) and semi-
synthetic human insulin (100 IU/mL) had the same blood glucose lowering effect, following 
subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal (IP) administration. However, the IP route of administration 
elicited only a pharmacodynamic response in half of the tested animals (6 out of 12) vs. most (11 out 
of 12) SC treated animals. The similar pharmacodynamic response of both tested insulins is in 
concordance with earlier studies where both insulins (100 IU/ml) were tested in different formulations 
after subcutaneous injection in rabbits and dogs. Since clinical efficacy data are available, no additional 
studies have been performed with Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL; this was acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Based on the identity of the recombinant human insulin (HR1799) to the endogenous human hormone, 
no absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion (ADME) studies were performed. 
Drug interaction studies were not considered necessary or appropriate to be performed in animal 
experiments, since additional administration of other drugs may potentiate or attenuate the 
pharmacological effect of insulin on blood glucose concentrations, for which considerable and sufficient 
clinical experience is available. 
The pharmacokinetics of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL in humans was investigated in the 
comparative phase of the clinical trial HUBIN_L_05335. 
The above approach taken by the applicant was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In a single-dose study, rats were administered semi-synthetic human insulin in a formulation with 
400 IU/mL and excipients identical to the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL formulation by IP injection 
at a volume of 10 mL/kg. This IP administration of 4000 IU/kg (including 27 mg/kg of phenol) did not 
cause any clinical symptoms, macroscopically visible changes or irritations in the abdominal cavity. 
One additional single-dose toxicity study in rats was performed, where recombinant human insulin 
(100 IU/mL) was compared with semi-synthetic human insulin (100 IU/mL) following SC injection. For 
both insulins no signs of toxicity were observed.  
There have been clinical findings of reversible hepatic subcapsular steatosis in diabetic patients treated 
with intraperitoneal insulin therapy. In view of this the applicant investigated this issue further in the 
non-clinical setting.

A published study in diabetic (Streptozotocin induced) rats (Ebel et al) that received Humulin 
(100U/ml) IP for 5 days via a pump and a catheter that had been fixed to the liver capsule 
demonstrated that focal steatosis occurred in livers from day 1 to day 5 after the start of treatment. 
Treatment was stopped at day 5 and complete reversibility was observed at day 10. This study 
confirmed the clinical findings and supported the hypothesis that high local insulin levels at the liver 
capsule may induce a focal hepatic steatosis.  
A second study (Stéphanie Dal-Ros, Nathalie Jeandidier, Elodie Seyfritz, William Bietiger, Claude 
Péronet, François Moreau, Michel Pinget, and Séverine Sigrist, Impact of intraperitoneal insulin infusion 
on metabolism and hepatic oxidative stress in streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic-rats, 2013, Hepatology) 
was done with Insuplant in diabetic rats to compare the IP route of administration to the SC route. This 
study has shown that insulin administered by IP is mainly absorbed by the portal vein and is not 
associated with insulin resistance in the liver. Livers were examined after 1 and 4 weeks of treatment: 
there were no signs of macroscopic or physiopathologic modifications, and no signs for subcapsular 
focal steatosis. There were also no signs for local intolerance that might be due to phenol in the 
formulation of Insuman Insuplant. 
No further toxicity studies were considered necessary since they would not eliminate the potential risk 
of focal hepatic steatosis in patients. 
In addition, the company provided an overview of the toxicity of phenol. In particular, the potential of 
phenol to induce local irritation or promote carcinogenicity of the formulation was assessed on the 
basis of the provided data. The data focuses on the genotoxic and clastogenic effects of phenol only. 
The Applicant discusses several publications which show that IP administration of phenol resulted in no 
or only weak clastogenic effect. A calculation showing that exposure of the liver after IP administration 
will be low is also presented. The Applicant also presented data showing that if phenol does not have a 
direct genotoxic and carcinogenic effect, it can act as a promoter of such an effect. Phenol has for 
example been demonstrated to be a skin-tumor promoter. Human insulin is mitogenic and could be 
expected to promote growth of pre-existing tumours but not to initiate formation of tumours. Phenol is 
a promotor, so it also is not considered to initiate a tumour. So, theoretically, no carcinogenic effect is 
expected as a consequence of exposure to a combination of a promotor and a mitogen. The CHMP 
concluded that based on the available data there was no reason for concern.  
Local Tolerance  
A local tolerance study, comparing 100 IU/mL formulations of recombinant human insulin with semi-
synthetic human insulin at a subcutaneous dose of 1 IU/kg revealed no local toxicity. This study, 
however is not relevant for the assessment of the local tolerability of Insuman Implantable. No local 
tolerance studies were conducted with Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL. This was accepted by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A justification for not performing an environmental risk assessment was submitted in line with the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). The CHMP agreed that Insuman Implantable is exempted of ERA due to 
the nature of its active substance. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL is a new formulation of recombinant human insulin. This formulation 
is to be used in Medtronic implantable pumps as a continuous infusion by the intraperitoneal route.

Insuman (human recombinant insulin for subcutaneous use) was already the subject of a nonclinical 
evaluation at the time of its initial authorisation and the local tolerance of this substance after SC 
injection is well known. 
A few nonclinical studies have been performed on the new formulation. Results show a pharmacological 
activity similar to that of the semi-synthetic insulin and a good local tolerance in the rabbit when 
administered subcutaneously.  
Two non-GLP non-clinical studies were submitted that studied the impact of insulin (either Humulin or 
Insuman Insuplant) administered IP along with phenol. Although of very short duration as compared to 
the clinical use, these studies are consistent with what has been observed in two clinical cases. Focal 
steatosis occurs very rapidly when the catheter is fixed to the hepatic capsule and that high 
concentrations of insulin (with phenol) reach the liver surface, always in the same region.  
Insuman Implantable contains phenol as excipient. Phenol is clastogenic in vivo in micronucleus assays 
and potentially genotoxic. Its co-administration along with insulin, a mitogenic compound, might be an 
issue  in  case  the  catheter  that  delivers  the  product  is  stuck  to  or  near  the  liver  capsule  and  the  two 
products are delivered long term and at high doses always near the same liver region. The long term 
risk  was  discussed  by  the  Applicant,  and  the  potential  risks  of  the  combination  insulin/phenol  in  a 
situation  where  the  catheter  is  not  mobile  were  also  discussed,  leading  to  the  conclusion  that  no 
carcinogenic effect is expected as a consequence of exposure to a combination of a promotor (phenol) 
and a mitogen (insulin). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers there are no outstanding non-clinical issues which preclude the granting of the 
marketing authorisation. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The studies described in this study programme investigated CIPII (Continuous Intraperitoneal Insulin 
Infusion) with Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml and/or Insuplant 400 IU/ml in patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus. There is one pivotal study, HUBIN _L _05335, comparing Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL and Insuplant 400 IU/mL (both active treatments). There is one supportive study, MIP 310, 
which compares either Insuman Implantable or Insuplant to subcutaneous insulin delivered either with 
multiple daily injection or external subcutaneous pump. There are six additional supportive studies in 
type 1 diabetic patients using Insuplant 400 IU/ml (active treatment) with the MIP (Medtronic MiniMed 
implantable pump). 
The comparative phase of HUBIN provides clinical experience in 168 patients, 84 randomized to 
Insuman Implantable and 84 in the Insuplant comparator arm. The study phase of MIP 310 provides 
experience in 50 patients with CIPII, exposed to both Insuman Implantable and Insuplant. In the 
uncontrolled MIP 310 study extension, the continuation and maintenance phases provided additional 
safety data in those patients on MIP. The six additional supportive studies provide clinical experience 
particularly for safety in approximately 600 type 1 diabetic patients with Insuplant 400 IU/ mL. 
Publications describing the EVADIAC (EVAluation dans le Diabète des Implants ACtifs) group’s clinical 
experience with the intra-peritoneal pump and other studies with Insuplant 400 IU/mL and the MIP are 
also discussed.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of insulin depend primarily on its route of administration, followed by 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 16/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
physical activity, temperature and other variables. In subjects without diabetes, the serum half-life of 
insulin is four to six minutes when injected subcutaneously. 
The intraperitoneal route of insulin infusion bypasses the subcutaneous interstitial milieu and causes a 
predominant diffusion of insulin through the hepatic portal venous system.  In the HUBIN study 
pharmacokinetic assessments were performed in a subset of 24 patients (11 on Insuman and 13 on 
Insuplant) all administered IP (see below). 
Absorption  
By means of a sub-study in the study HUBIN_L_05335, the PK profile of Insuman Implantable 400 
IU/mL following intra-peritoneal infusion has been investigated and compared with that of Insuplant 
400 IU/mL following intra-peritoneal infusion. 24 patients were evaluated (Insuman:11 – 
Insuplant:13).  
Following CIPII administration of 0.15 IU/kg Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL or Insuplant 400 IU/mL, 
no statistically significant differences were observed for Tmax, Cmax and AUC0-4h at visit 5. For 
Insuman Implantable, Tmax was 0.54 hours, Cmax in serum was 210 ± 129 μIU/ml and AUC0-4h was 
286 ± 122 μIU•h/ml. The similar Cmax and AUC0-4h indicate a similar exposure to both insulins. 
Summary of PK parameters of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml and Insuplant U400 
following intra-peritoneal infusion 
No statistically significant difference between the two insulins was observed for Cmax, Tmax, T1/2z 
and AUC0-4h 
A statistically significant difference (p=0.0066) was observed for AUCBolus,0 4h (defined as AUC0-4h-
4•Ctrough) with an intergroup ratio (Insuman Implantable / Insuplant) being 2.36 with CI 95 % [1. 
3108 ; 4.2538]. The AUCBolus,0 4h of Insuman Implantable was 217 ± 88.4 μIU•h/ml. 
The cause for this difference could not conclusively be elucidated. Even if potential causes are 
conceivable, the applicant cannot give a definite explanation for this observation.

Distribution 
No study was performed. The intra-peritoneal route of insulin infusion bypasses the subcutaneous 
interstitial milieu and mimics the function of normal beta cells by a predominant diffusion of insulin 
through the hepatic portal venous system. 
Elimination 
Following CIPII administration of 0.15 IU/kg Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL or Insuplant 400 IU/mL, 
no statistically significant difference was observed for t1/2z. After administration of Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL, insulin was eliminated from serum with an apparent mean half-life of 2.7 
hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Not applicable. 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
• 
Elderly 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
• 
Children 
The safety and efficacy of Insuman Implantable (intraperitoneal use) have not been established in 
paediatric patients.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin.  
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics.  
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 18/79 
 
 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-
lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by 
hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
The interactions properties of Insuman Implantable are documented based on earlier studies with 
other insulin formulations that apply to this submission. No specific drug-drug interaction study for this 
new route of administration is performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL. 
The Applicant has submitted a literature review of continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion.  CIPII is 
thought to offer a route of delivery more similar to the normal physiological route than current 
subcutaneous therapies. 
The pharmacodynamic action of insulin is sufficiently known and the CHMP agreed that no further 
studies were required. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the phase III study HUBIN_L_05335, except for AUCBolus,0-4h (intergroup ratio Insuman 
Implantable / Insuplant: 2.36 IC95 % [1.3108;4.2538]), no statistically significant between group 
difference in PK parameters was observed.  
The HUBIN study does not compare PK between other routes of insulin administration and IP, but it 
does show comparability between Insuman and Insuplant (both through IP route). Mean insulin 
concentrations reached tended to be slightly higher for Insuman (AUC bolus), but on the other hand 
trough levels tended to be lower and there were no statistical differences in regard to the other 
pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic parameters (hypo- and hyperglycaemia, glycaemic control) 
between Insuplant and Insuman. Therefore it was agreed that the differences between Insuman and 
Insuplant have no real clinical relevance. As IP insulin administration should be, and is in clinical 
practice, only used in a very small subset of patients and therefore recruitment potential of patients is 
very limited, the CHMP considers that the HUBIN trial is sufficient to assess differences in PK profile 
between Insuplant and Insuman Implantable IP administration. In addition the data are considered 
reassuring for comparability between both insulins. However, no direct comparison with other routes, 
such as subcutaneous, of insulin administration was made. As IP pumps are mainly used in a 
population were SC insulin administration has become problematic, one might wonder whether such a 
direct comparison would make sense. The fact that use of IP insulin should be restricted to patients 
with problematic SC treatment because of demonstrated absorption issues through SC administration 
of insulin is reflected in the SmPC. In conclusion, indirect comparison of SC (published data on PK from 
SC insulin administration) versus IP (HUBIN study, though limited) administration is now available and 
can suffice. It is considered by the CHMP that larger direct comparisons are probably not feasible nor 
clinically relevant when the patient population is clearly defined as a population in which SC treatment 
has been rendered impossible or highly problematic. 
In the scientific literature, the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous insulin injections were compared, 
intraperitoneal insulin delivery resulting in earlier, higher and more acute peak insulin concentrations 
than achieved by subcutaneous injection. After IP administration, plasma insulin profiles mimic 
physiological events more closely.  
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 19/79 
 
 
The literature speaks well about the important reduction of severe hypoglycaemic events, which is the 
most impressive benefit of the clinical use of implanted insulin pump using IP insulin delivery, related 
to the good reproducibility of insulin absorption, the combined quicker time to peak and return to 
baseline, and the closer-to-physiological insulin levels after IP vs. SC bolus administration. 
According to the literature and as discussed by the applicant in the dossier, using intraperitoneal 
insulin delivery is related to the increased production of anti-insulin antibodies in some patients. The 
applicant further discussed the effect of the increase in anti-insulin antibody levels on the PK 
parameters. As observed in the different articles, the apparition of insulin antibodies in insulin-treated 
patients is known for a long time but thanks to the use of semi-synthetic or recombinant human 
insulin, the prevalence has decreased. However, many patients still produce levels of insulin antibodies 
that may be clinically significant with respect to glycaemic control. Moreover, some data suggest that 
implantable insulin pumps induce a stronger immune response against insulin than conventional 
treatment. According to Lassmann-Vague et al. 1995, the increase in insulin immunogenicity did not 
induce significant metabolic consequences in the case of programmable insulin pumps. However, the 
consequences of high anti-insulin levels in type I diabetic patients are still controversial and not 
confirmed by all authors. In this context, the HUBIN study does not really add any new information in 
regard to this subject and all patients were pretreated with Insuplant, which makes impossible to 
assess the exact effect of Insuman Implantable.  
This issue can therefore be considered as resolved from a pharmacokinetic perspective especially as 
sufficient information is stated in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC, and the necessity for a potential 
dose-adjustment is adequately mentioned. With regards to immunogenicity the applicant presented 
safety data on the IP route of administration from study MIP310, including lack of clinically relevant 
immunogenicity for patients who were naive to IP therapy.  
Time dependency was not possible to explore as the results obtained on visit 2 were not presented by 
the Applicant as the serum samples taken at visit 2 were analysed after the expiring date of the 
confirmed storage stability. It was not clear whether the measured concentrations reflect the true 
values. The Applicant was requested to provide extended storage and stability data if possible. These 
measurements are ongoing and will be provided as a legally binding post-authorisation measure in 
December 2013.  
The Applicant provided a comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters determined on visit 2 with those 
determined approximately 4 months later on visit 5, which revealed no time dependency in the PK of 
human insulin following intraperitoneal administration of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL. Intra- and 
inter-patient variability data are provided. For Cmax and AUC0-4h, the intrapatient variability is similar 
following intraperitoneal administration of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL and Insuplant 400 IU/mL. 
For AUCBolus,0-4h, the intra-patient variability is markedly lower following administration of Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL. Compared to intraperitoneal administration of Insuplant 400 IU/mL, the 
respective administration of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL resulted in lower inter-patient variability 
of Cmax, AUCBolus,0-4h and AUC0-4h. 
In conclusion, the PK of human insulin following intraperitoneal administration of Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL is not time dependent and results in a similar or even lower variability in its PK compared to 
intraperitoneal administration of Insuplant 400 IU/mL.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the there are no outstanding pharmacology issues which preclude the granting of 
the marketing authorisation.

The applicant committed to submit the results of the extended storage and stability measurements, as 
these data are not yet available. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
There are two studies that support the efficacy of Insuman Implantable and they are discussed below. 
The comparative phase of HUBIN is the pivotal study that compares Insuman Implantable and 
Insuplant, and MIP 310 that compares the use of CIPII and SC insulin. The additional studies with 
Insuplant are observational trials that add to the safety data base and knowledge on the use of intra-
peritoneal insulin. 
2.5.1.  Main study (HUBIN_L_05335)  
Methods 
HUBIN was a phase 3, multicenter clinical trial that consisted of 3 phases: 
1.  The  first  phase  is  a  comparative,  randomized  in  parallel  group,  single  blind  (for  patient)  phase 
with  Insuman  Implantable  400  IU/mL  or  Insuplant  400  IU/mL  as  active  comparator,  during  4 
refill cycles, carried out in French patients (randomized: 169, treated 168).  One primary objective 
of  the  comparative  phase  of  the  pivotal  HUBIN  study  was  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of 
Insuman  Implantable  as  the  investigational  drug  compared  to  Insuplant  on  glycaemic  control  as 
evaluated by change in HbA1c from baseline. The co-primary objective of the comparative phase of 
HUBIN was the pump refill accuracy over 4 refill cycles, i.e. 160 ± 20 days in patients. 
2.  Running parallel with the comparative phase, there is a non-comparative  phase with Insuplant 
400  IU/mL  (164  patients).  The  objectives  of  the  Insuplant  non-comparative phase  was  to  assess 
efficacy measured as HbA1c and refill  accuracy,  safety and device  interventions during the open-
label treatment period with Insuplant (Insuplant noncomparative phase). 
  At the end of the comparative phase, all patients included in the comparative phase and the 
Insuplant non-comparative phase were entered into a non-comparative phase with Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL. In addition, starting in July 2011, 94 patients have been included directly 
in the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL non-comparative phase to ensure the continuity of their 
treatment up to the approval of the product. The objective was to assess efficacy, safety, refill 
accuracy evolution and device interventions during the open-label treatment period with Insuman.

Study Participants  
The comparative phase of HUBIN was carried out in 168 patients with type 1 diabetics already treated 
with CIPII (Insuplant 400 IU/ml via a Medtronic MiniMed Implantable System 2007) most of whom met 
EVADIAC criteria for intra-peritoneal pump at time of implantation. Indication for pump implantation 
was due to “brittle diabetes” in 63.8% of the patients and was similar in both insulin treatment 
groups.  Inclusion criteria were: HbA1c ≤9.0% and a percentage of error at refill equal or below 20%. 
Patients older than 65 years of age were allowed.  
Treatments 
In the comparative phase of HUBIN, patients were randomized to either Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL or Insuplant 400IU/mL in the MIP 2007 pump model. 
The starting dose regimen (basal rates and boluses) of treatment at inclusion visit was expected to be 
the same as the one administered to the patient prior to entering the trial.  
Before patient’s selection in the comparative phase, systematic 10 min-NaOH rinse procedure with 
catheter flush via sideport had to be performed before administration of randomized insulin. Pump refill 
had to be performed every 40 ± 5 days during the comparative phase. In case of pump system failure, 
patients were instructed to use subcutaneous insulin to control their diabetes. 
When refill accuracy was equal to or below 85% during the study, NaOH rinse procedure with catheter 
flush via sideport had to be performed. 
When a catheter blockage or encapsulation was diagnosed or suspected, laparoscopy was required to 
confirm the diagnosis and resolve catheter obstruction if confirmed.

Objectives 
One primary objective of the comparative phase of the pivotal HUBIN study was to demonstrate the 
non-inferiority of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL as the investigational drug compared to Insuplant 
400 IU/mL on glycaemic control as evaluated by change in HbA1c from baseline. The co-primary 
objective of the comparative phase of HUBIN was the pump refill accuracy over 4 refill cycles, i.e., 160 
days in patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy parameters (measured at baseline and each refill cycle): 
  Refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles: percentage difference between the theoretical refill volume 
calculated by the personal pump communicator (PPC) using programmed values and the actual 
refill volume used by weight measurement: 
(theoretical – actual)/theoretical x 100 % 
  HbA1c change from baseline after 4 refill cycles 
Secondary efficacy parameters: 
  Actual and theoretical daily insulin doses between two refills. 
 
 
Insulin basal rate and boluses of the 24 hours preceding each visit. 
Frequency of use of subcutaneous insulin, and total amount of subcutaneous insulin used. (“rescue 
insulin”) 
Key safety endpoints: 
Other assessments: Device interventions 
  Number of extra-refill. 
  Number of rinsing procedures. 
  Number of pump blockages as defined as no insulin delivery despite the 4-hour NaOH rinsing 
procedure. 
  Number of other device interventions: pump, catheter, PPC, refill kit and mini-med needle 
interventions. 
Sample size 
In the comparative phase of HUBIN, a total of 46 patients were required (or 23 per treatment group) 
to attain at least 95% power for the refill accuracy, the co-primary criterion, to establish the non-
inferiority comparison at the 5% level assuming that the standard deviation is 5%, with a non-
inferiority limit set at 5%. For the other co-primary criterion, change from baseline in HbA1c, a total of 
160 patients were required (or 80 per treatment group) to attain at least 80% power to establish at 
the 5% level the non-inferiority, assuming that the standard deviation of change from baseline in 
HbA1c is 1%, with a non-inferiority limit set at 0.4%. An assumed zero true difference between the 
two randomized treatments was considered for both criteria. So, a total of 160 patients were included 
and randomized in this study in order to reach an acceptable global power to establish the non-
inferiority for both co-primary criteria.

Randomisation 
For the comparative phase, the randomization list was produced and kept by the sponsor 
biostatistician. To randomize a patient, the Investigator had to call to an Interactive Voice Response 
System. 
Blinding (masking) 
The comparative phase of the HUBIN study was blinded for the patient only. In order to ensure the 
single blind, the preparation of syringes with the appropriate study medication at each refill was done 
by the investigator away from the patient before administration. 
The blinding was not respected for 4 patients: 3 on Insuman and 1 on Insuplant. 
Statistical methods 
The hypothesis of non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL compared to the Insuplant 
400 IU/mL was tested by calculating the bilateral 95% CI of the difference between groups (Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL and Insuplant 400 IU/mL) of the HbA1c change from baseline after 4 refill 
cycles. The non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL compared to the Insuplant 
400 IU/mL was established if the upper limit of the 95 % CI did not exceed the non-inferiority border, 
i.e., 0.4%. 
Similarly for the other co-primary endpoint, the hypothesis of non-inferiority of the Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL compared to the Insuplant 400 IU/mL was tested by calculating the bilateral 
95% CI of the difference between groups (Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL and Insuplant 400 IU/mL) 
of the refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles. The non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL 
compared to the Insuplant 400 IU/mL was established if the upper limit of the 95 % CI did not exceed 
the non-inferiority border, i.e., 5%. 
The non-inferiority analysis was performed in the per protocol (PP) and the modified intention to treat 
(mITT) populations. The two populations have equal importance and should lead to similar conclusion. 
Last observation Carried Forward method was applied for the main co-criteria for the patients who had 
missing values. 
For refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles, a complementary analysis with maximum bias (missing values 
replaced by 0 in Insuplant group and by Q3 value in Insuman Implantable group) was also conducted 
in the mITT population to assess the effect of missing refill accuracy values. 
Results 
Participant flow 
169 patients were included in the comparative phase between 16 November 2010 and 20 January 
2011 by 15 centers. All included patients were randomized: 84 in the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL 
group and 85 in the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group. 
Patients’ disposition: 164 patients (82 patients of each group) completed the study. In the Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL group, 2 patients (2.4 %) were withdrawn: one for adverse event 
(explantation before a planned pregnancy) and the other for pump blockage during the rinsing 
performed before investigational product initiation. In the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group, 3 patients 
(3.5 %) were withdrawn: one for adverse event (no healing of the skin after pump implantation), 
another for pump failure at first refill, and the third for deviation of inclusion criteria (error percentage 
superior to 20 %).

164 patients already treated with Insuplant 400 IU/mL via Medtronic MiniMed Implantable System 
2007, were included in the Insuplant non-comparative phase, running in parallel with the 
comparative phase (first patient enrolled: 22 November 2010; last patient completed: 19 September 
2011). Treatment and observation duration in the Insuplant non-comparative phase depended on the 
inclusion date. Patients enrolled later were followed for fewer cycles as all patients had to switch to 
Insuman during the same period. (6 cycles (0.6%), 5 cycles (12.8%), 4 cycles (50.6%), 3 cycles 
(70.1%), 2 cycles (81.7%) to 1 cycle (99.4%)). 
Patients’ disposition: 155 patients completed the study; 9 patients withdrew due to: adverse events 
(3, blocked catheter, catheter occlusion, pump explantation), death (1), lack of efficacy (1), pump 
explantation (1), pump failure (1), switch to external insulin pump (1) and pump battery low voltage 
(1). 
417 patients enrolled in the non-comparative phase with Insuman. The first patient enrolled 17 
November 2010. This means that the patients treated with Insuman in the comparative phase 
of the HUBIN trial are included in the analysis of the Insuman non-comparative phase. These 
involved patients already treated with Insuplant 400 IU/mL via Medtronic MiniMed Implantable System 
2007 or Patients being re-implanted with a new pump (first fill with insulin) or patients being implanted 
with MiniMed Implantable Pump. Patients completed 16 to 0 cycles (16 cycles (0.2%), 15 cycles 
(1.0%), 14 cycles (4.8%), 13 cycles (11.5%), 12 cycles (19.2%), 11 cycles (22.1%), 10 cycles 
(26.1%), 9 cycles (46.8%), 8 cycles (78.7%), 7 cycles (89.7%), 6 cycles (93.0%), 5 cycles (94.5%), 4 
cycles (96.4%), 3 cycles (97.4%), 2 cycles (98.3%), 1 cycles (98.8%), 0 cycles (100%)). 
Patients’ disposition: 404 patients (96.9%) continued at the cut-off date (30 June 2012); 13 
patients withdrew due to: adverse events (10); wish to discontinue (2); anti-insulin antibody syndrome 
(medical history, 1). The adverse events leading to study drug withdrawal were: 7 patients (1.7 %) 
with adverse events in relation with the pump (device battery issue: 1 patient, device dislocation: 1 
patient, drug delivery device removal: 1 patient, implant site inflammation: 1 patient, device related 
infection: 1 patient, implant site infection: 1 patient and skin erosion due to pump: 1 patient), 1 
patient with hyperglycaemia, ketosis and cognitive disorders, 1 patient with hypoglycaemia and 1 
patient with cerebrovascular accident. Out of the patients who experienced at least one serious 
treatment emergent adverse event, 2 patients died. 
Baseline data 
In general, patient populations in the Insuman Implantable and Insuplant groups were similar in terms 
of baseline characteristics including duration of diabetes, duration of CIPII and reason for treatment 
with CIPII. 
Patients were 53±10.85 years old (Table ). The distribution of the BMI classes is similar between the 
two groups; 17.9% of the Insuman Implantable group and 16.7% of the Insuplant group have a BMI 
>30 Kg/m².

Table 2: Demographic data in mITT population for HbA1c 
In the mITT population for HbA1c, the mean time from the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was 32.4 years 
on average (median: 32.1 years) and the duration of treatment with CIPII was on average 11.7 years 
(median: 11.0 years). The current pump had been implanted for 2.4 years on average (median: 2.1 
years) and current insulin (Insuplant) had been used for 8.9 years on average (median: 7.2 years). 
There was no clinically significant difference in the distribution of these criteria between the two 
treatment groups (Table Table 3). The data for the mITT population for HbA1c are shown. No 
differences were shown for diabetes history for other populations.

Table 4: Summary of analysis populations 
The modified intention to treat (mITT) population includes patients who gave their informed consent, 
for whom there is confirmation of successful allocation of a randomization number through the study 
treatment allocation system, who were exposed to the study drug, i.e., who received at least one 
administration of the study drug and who had an evaluation for each primary outcome (mITT for 
HbA1c and mITT for refill accuracy).  
No post-baseline refill value means no available post-baseline refill value (Insuman 1 patient and 
Insuplant 3 patients) or no valid post-baseline refill value (17 patients in each group). This is 20 % of 
the study population. Invalidation was deemed necessary because of inconsistencies of refill accuracy 
values at different visits for a same patient. 
Experts checked refill accuracy values. All outliers were defined as invalided values. 
The per protocol populations were defined as subsets of the mITT population without major protocol 
violations for each primary parameter. The main deviations observed were: “Duration of insulin 
injection >7 days” in 6.5% of the patients and “Time between refills not in the interval 40 ± 5 days” in 
4.8% of the patients. 
9.2% of the patients of the mITT population for refill accuracy presented at least one major deviation: 
6.1% of the patients in Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL group and 12.5% in Insuplant 400 IU/mL 
group. The rate of the deviation “Time between refills not in the interval 40 ± 5 days”, was also higher 
in the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group (6.3%) than in the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL one (1.5%). 
One patient of the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group who was not treated was excluded from Safety 
population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
In the comparative phase of the HUBIN study, conducted to show that recombinant insulin 
formulation (Insuman Implantable 400 UI/ml) could replace semi-synthetic insulin (Insuplant 
400 UI/ml), analysis in the PP populations and in the mITT populations both concluded on the non-
inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml compared to the Insuplant 400 IU/ml for the two co-
primary endpoints: 
1.  The refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles (95% CI of the intergroup difference [ -5.81 ; -0.50 ] in 
PP population and [ -5.21 ; -0.31 ] in mITT population for refill accuracy – non-inferiority limit: 
5%). 
2.  The HbA1c change from baseline after 4 refill cycles (95% CI of the intergroup difference       
[ -0.36 ; 0.11 ] in PP population and [ -0.30 ; 0.16 ] in mITT population for HbA1c – noninferiority 
limit: 0.4%). 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 28/79 
 
 
The non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml compared to the Insuplant 400 IU/ml was 
also confirmed in the complementary analysis with maximum bias (missing values replaced by 0 in 
Insuplant group and by Q3 value in Insuman) for the parameter refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles 
(95% CI of the intergroup difference [ -3.25 ; -0.61 ] in mITT population). 
Analysis of secondary efficacy criteria has shown similar results in PP population and mITT population 
for HbA1c: 
1.  A slight decrease in actual and theoretical daily insulin doses in both treatment groups with no 
clinically significant difference between treatment groups nor between actual and theoretical doses. 
2.  No clinically significant difference between both treatment groups for the dose used during the last 
24 hours at each visit. 
There were similar rates of patients in the two treatment groups who received at least one other 
insulin injection “rescue insulin” during the study: 11/84 patients of the Insuman Implantable group 
versus 10/84 patients of the Insuplant group. Subcutaneous insulin was used most of the time during 
delivery system dysfunction (catheter occlusion, PPC issue): 9/11 patients for Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/ml group and 7/10 patients for Insuplant 400 IU/ml group. 
The baseline HbA1c value in the mITT population for HbA1c was 7.74±1.04% and the change from 
baseline varied between -0.06 and -0.25 % for the same population. In the Insuman arm this was 
7.76±0.92 at baseline and the change from baseline varied between -0.08 and -0.31 %. 
The refill accuracy in the mITT population for refill accuracy varied between -0.19 and 1.13 and 
between -0.31 and -1.71 for the Insuman arm. 
No clinically significant difference was observed between the two treatment groups for the incidence of 
hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia. 
In the Insuplant non-comparative phase of the HUBIN study, the results for the primary efficacy 
criteria were:

The change in the refill accuracy error percentage from baseline did not substantially change during 
the Insuplant non-comparative phase; the mean (± sd) changes from baseline varying between 1.08 ± 
9.98 % (V4) and 2.67 ± 10.10 % (V2). Missing values for refill accuracy were mainly due to 
inconsistency in values, which was also the case in the comparative phase of the HUBIN trial. 
HbA1c was stable during the study, the mean (± sd) HbA1c varying between 7.80 ± 1.25 % (V3) and 
8.13 ± 1.32 % (V4), and the mean changes from baseline between -0.01 ± 0.57 % (V2) and -0.14 ± 
0.71 % (V3). The missing rate of HbA1c values is mainly due to study design. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy criteria has shown an actual daily insulin dose slightly smaller than 
theoretical dose at each visit, and a slight decrease in actual and theoretical daily insulin doses. 
The interim analysis all patients treated with Insuman in the HUBIN trial were considered since 
their first fill with Insuman until the cut-off date for the interim analysis. 
Refill accuracy error percentage did not substantially change during the study phase. The mean (± sd) 
changes from baseline varied between -0.59 ± 14.18 % (cycle 4 – 256 patients) and 6.12 ± 11.91 % 
(cycle 13 – 25 patients). Mean (± std) refill accuracy error percentage was -0.59 ± 8.50 % (median: -
0.12 %) at first refill after pump implantation and 4.40 ± 9.86 % (median: 3.35 %) at baseline. 
HbA1c was stable during the study phase, the mean (± sd) HbA1c varying between 7.74 % (C2 - 325 
patients and C12 - 65 patients) and 8.02 % (C9 – 144 patients), and the mean changes from baseline 
between -0.19 % (C2 – 294 patients) and 0.06 % (C8 – 223 patients). Mean ( ± std) HbA1c value at 
baseline (for interim analysis) was 7.92 ± 1.28 % (median: 7.70 %).  
Secondary efficacy criteria showed that actual and theoretical daily insulin doses of each cycle and the 
dose used during the last 24 hours did not significantly change from cycle 1 to 8. From cycle 9 to 14 
the required dose was higher. 
The basal and bolus doses (IU) of the last 24 h varied between 52.70 ± 27.73 and 55.91 ± 32.78 from 
cycle 1 to 8, in an ITT population above 300 patients. And from cycle 9 to 14, in an ITT population 
below 170 patients these values varied between 59.98 ± 37.95 and 67.02 ± 43.71. 
The apparent shift in insulin dose when examining the whole population most likely represents 
heterogeneity of patients at different cycles in the population in the Insuman non-comparative phase. 
For the subpopulation of those 90 patients who all achieved cycle 10, there was actually a decrease in 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report

Page 30/79 
 
 
 
insulin need from cycle 1 to cycle 10 and there was consistency between actual and theoretical doses 
of insulin. 
As obese subjects need larger amounts of insulin, the Applicant performed an analysis of the reduction 
in HbA1c and AEs according to BMI category. Efficacy and safety were comparable for the different 
categories. No differences between weight classes were observed for refill accuracy. 
163 patients (39.1 % of the ITT population) used subcutaneous insulin at least once during the study 
phase. Subcutaneous insulin was used most of the time during delivery system dysfunction (reason of 
241 / 389 injections; i.e. 62% of the cases) or due to metabolic control issues.

Modified Intent-to-treat: The modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) population 
included patients who have given their informed consent, for whom there was 
confirmation of successful allocation of a randomization number through the 
study treatment allocation system, and who were exposed to the study drug 
(i.e. who received at least one administration of the study drug) and who had 
an evaluation for each primary outcome (mITT for HbA1c and mITT for refill 
accuracy). 
Per-protocol: The Per-Protocol (PP) populations were subsets of the mITT 
population without major protocol violations for each primary parameter.

Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
169 patients were included in the comparative phase between 
16 November 2010 and 20 January 2011 by 15 centres. 164 patients 
(82 patients of each group) completed the study. In the Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL group, 2 patients (2.4 %) were withdrawn: one for adverse event 
(explantation before pregnancy planned, as specified in the protocol) and the 
other for pump blockage during the rinsing performed before investigational 
product initiation. In the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group, 3 patients (3.5 %) were 
withdrawn: one for adverse event (no healing of the skin after pump 
implantation), another for pump failure at first refill, and the third for 
deviation of inclusion criteria (error percentage superior to 20 %). 
Analyses in PP populations and in mITT populations concluded both to the 
non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml compared to the 
Insuplant 400 IU/ml for:  
• Refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles as the upper limit of the 95% CI did not 
exceed the non-inferiority limit (5%). 
• HbA1c change from baseline after 4 refill cycles as the upper limit of the 
95% CI did not exceed the non-inferiority limit (0.4%). Although not 
pre-specified, non inferiority is confirmed even with a more stringent non 
inferiority limit of 0.3%    
Analysis of secondary efficacy criteria has shown similar results in PP 
population and mITT population for HbA1c: 
• a slight decrease in actual and theoretical daily insulin doses between 
baseline and visit V5 in both treatment groups, and no clinically significant 
difference between treatment groups nor between actual and theoretical 
doses. 
• no clinically significant difference between both treatment groups for the 
dose used during the last 24 hours at each visit. 
Co-primary Endpoints 
The hypothesis of non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL 
compared to the Insuplant 400 IU/mL was tested by calculating the bilateral 
95% CI of the difference between groups (Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL - Insuplant 400 IU/mL) of the refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles. 
The non-inferiority of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL compared to the 
Insuplant 400 IU/mL was established if the upper limit of the 95 % CI did not 
exceed the non-inferiority border, i.e. 5%.

Supportive study MIP 310 and other supportive studies 
Figure 2. Schedule – Study Phase, Continuation and Maintenance Phases of Study MIP 310 
Study 310 was a randomised, active-control, parallel group, phase III study in T1DM subjects. The 
study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of IP administration of insulin using the MIP 2007 
model compared with intensive SC administration of insulin. The CIPII group received two insulin 
formulations during the 360 day Study Phase: Insuplant 400 IU/ml for the first 180 days and Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/ml for the second 180 days. The SC group received pre-existing insulin injected 
subcutaneously (by injection or infusion via external pump), at doses specified by the patient, for 360 
days and was not restricted in the type of insulin used during the study. For patients on CIPII a 
continuation phase and a maintenance phase were implemented after the study phase of 360 days. 
Patients received Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml for another 12 months before transferring to 
Insuplant 400 IU/ml for 12 months. 
Primary efficacy parameters in MIP 310 were HbA1c and number of severe hypoglycaemic events. 
Secondary efficacy parameters were self-monitored blood glucose measurements, mean amplitude of 
glycaemic excursions, low blood glucose index and relative pump refill error. 
The primary efficacy results are described in the following table:

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two important studies were submitted (Study MIP 310 and HUBIN). In addition, 6 other studies are 
considered supportive by the applicant; however, these studies are of limited relevance as these 
studies only used Insuplant.  
HUBIN Study: Comparative Phase 
Patient populations in the Insuman Implantable and Insuplant groups were similar in terms of baseline 
characteristics  including  duration  of  diabetes,  duration  of  CIPII  and  reason  for  treatment  with  CIPII 
(Table 2). 
Table 2. Treatment before implantation in mITT population for HbA1c 
On average 49% of the population was female, time from current pump implantation was 2.38 ± 1.75 
years, 78% had at least one diabetic late complication. The average baseline HbA1c value (at V1) was 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 35/79 
 
 
 
 
 
7.74±1.04 %. The average refill accuracy in the per protocol population for refill accuracy was 
0.30±5.81 at V1. 
The inclusion criteria possibly introduced bias in this study. The inclusion criteria were HbA1c ≤9% and 
percentage error at refill equal or below 20%. The HbA1c at baseline was slightly worse at 8.03% 
(N=138) in the Insuplant non-comparative phase compared to 7.76% for Insuman and 7.72% for 
Insuplant at baseline (mITT for HbA1c) in the comparative phase. The refill accuracy was also slightly 
worse at 3.59 (N=124, 24% missing data) compared to -1.27 for Insuman and -1.83 for Insuplant 
(mITT for refill accuracy; 8% and 22% missing data in the mITT) at baseline for the comparative 
phase.  
This is not expected to have an influence on the non-inferiority of Insuman Implantable versus 
Insuplant. However, this has a small influence on the safety and reliability of the therapy in the true 
therapeutic population. 
In the 6 months preceding the inclusion visit 5% of the patients (4 in each treatment group) presented 
at least one severe hypoglycaemia; 29 (17.3%) of the patients had at least one medical/surgical 
history of the current pump.  
Patients were excluded from the mITT population for refill accuracy if they had inconsistencies in 
measurement of their refill accuracy at any post-baseline visit and therefore no post-baseline refill 
values recorded. For these reasons, there were 66 out of 84 Insuman Implantable patients and 64 out 
of 85 Insuplant patients included in mITT population for refill accuracy. In addition, patients with any 
major protocol deviation were excluded from mITT population. For this reason, there were only 62 
patients in the Insuman Implantable and 56 patients in the Insuplant for PP population of the refill 
accuracy. Refill accuracy will therefore be overestimated due to exclusion of patients with inconsistent 
refill values.  
HUBIN Study: Insuplant Non-Comparative Phase  
In the non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial investigators followed their standard practice. The 
recommended rinsing procedure when refill accuracy error percentage was greater than 15 % was 
done in few patients: 2/10 patients (20 %) at V1, 4/17 patients (23.5 %) at V2, 5/15 patients (33.3 
%) at V3, 2/7 patients (28.6 %) at V4 and 4/11 patients (36.4 %) at V5. Rinsing procedures were also 
performed based on clinical evaluation (e.g. at V2, 9 rinsings were performed with a refill accuracy 
error percentage ≤ |15| %.). 
A protocol amendment was made: Pump refill was performed every 40 +/- 5 days, except for insuplant 
non-comparative phase (usual duration). The mean time between refills was 47±16 days in the non-
comparative Insuplant arm. 
There is a difference in baseline population characteristics between the patients in the comparative 
phase of the HUBIN trial and the remaining patient population on CIPII in the non-comparative 
Insuplant phase. 
- 
In the comparative phase 49% of the population was female, while in the non-comparative 
Insuplant phase, 70% of the population was female. 
- 
Time from current pump implantation was 3.95±2.77 years in the non-comparative Insuplant 
group while it was 2.38 ± 1.75 years in the comparative arm. 
-  78% of the patients in the comparative phase had at least one diabetic late complication. In 
the non-comparative Insuplant phase, this was a little lower: 74%. 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 36/79 
 
 
 
-  Reason for initiation in the patients in the comparative phase was insulin peripheral resistance 
for 5%, and hypoglycaemia (alone and in combination with brittle diabetes) for 32%. In the 
study population in the non-comparative Insuplant phase, this was insulin peripheral resistance 
in 13.5% (alone or in combination with brittle diabetes) and hypoglycaemia in 26% (alone or in 
combination with brittle diabetes). In the remaining part of the population it was ‘brittle 
diabetes’ (Table 3).  
Table 3. Treatment before implantation in analysis population 
- 
 At inclusion, refill accuracy error percentage was in average 3.59 ± 7.91 % (median: 3.15 %) 
and HbA1c 8.03 ± 1.18 % (median: 7.70 %). The average baseline refill accuracy error 
percentage in the comparative phase was -1.54 and the HbA1c value 7.74±1.04 %. 
HUBIN Study: Insuman Non-Comparative Phase  
In  the  interim  analysis  all  patients  treated  with  Insuman,  both  from  the  comparative  phase  of  the 
HUBIN trial and the non-comparative phase, were considered since their first fill with Insuman until the 
cut-off date for the interim analysis. 
Outliers were checked during the Data Review. Experts checked refill accuracy values. All outliers were 
defined as invalid values. 
The mean time between insulin refill, known for 407 patients, was 46 ± 13 days (median: 43 days). 
With  regards  to  the  baseline  characteristics,  the  ITT  population  was  composed  of  36.9  %  males  and 
63.1  %  females,  with  a  mean  age  of  51.2  years.  About  half  of  the  patients  (48.5  %)  had  a  normal 
weight, 32.2 % were overweight and 16.8 % were obese. 
The mean time from the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes was 30.7 years and the treatment with CIPII was 
started  on  average  10.7  years  before  the  start  of  the  study.  Current  pump  was  implanted  since  3.3 
years on average and current insulin (Insuplant) was started 9.1 years before the start of the study. 
The  following  table  shows  the  main  treatments  before  implantation  and  the  reasons  for  initiation  of 
CIPII.  
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 37/79 
 
 
  
 
Table 4. Treatment before implantation in ITT population 
Most of the patients (74.1 %) presented at least one diabetic late complication that mainly consisted of 
diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy. In addition, 19.7 % of patients had at least one medical 
or surgical history related to the current pump in the last six months. 
At baseline, refill accuracy error percentage was in average 4.40 ± 9.86 % (median: 3.35 %) and 
HbA1c 7.92 ± 1.28 % (median: 7.70 %). 
It should be highlighted that there were differences with the baseline characteristics in the comparative 
phase. 
-  63 % of the patients the Insuman non-comparative phase were female. This is more than in 
the comparative phase of the HUBIN trial. 
-  On average the current pump was implanted since 3.30±2.48 years, which is longer than in 
the comparative phase. 
-  Reason for initiation in the patients in the comparative phase was insulin peripheral resistance 
for 5%, and hypoglycaemia (alone and in combination with brittle diabetes) for 32%. In the 
Insuman non-comparative analysis 13% was included due to insulin peripheral resistance 
(alone or in combination with brittle diabetes) and 25% due to hypoglycaemia (alone or in 
combination with brittle diabetes). 
-  Refill accuracy error percentage at inclusion was 4.40 ± 9.86 % for the Insuman non-
comparative phase and 0.30±5.81 in the comparative phase. 
- 
The baseline HbA1c was 7.92 ± 1.28 % in the Insuman non-comparative phase and 7.74±1.04 
in the comparative phase. 
The mean time between refills was 41±3 days in the comparative phase of the HUBIN study and 
shifted to 46±13 days (N=407; median: 43 days) in the non-comparative Insuman analysis 
The baseline HbA1c in the Insuplant comparative phase was 7.72 ± 1.15, in the Insuplant non-
comparative phase this was 8.03 ± 1.18. According to the Applicant this is a non-significant difference. 
However, this most probably reflects the inclusion criterion of the comparative phase (HbA1c ≤ 9). The 
same is true for Insuman: 7.76 ± 0.92 in the comparative phase and 7.92 ± 1.28 for all the patients 
on Insuman.

Study MIP 310 
The difficulty associated to the design of study MIP310 was that it complicated the assessment of the 
benefit/risk of the studied product. First, effects of product and pump cannot be separated all the time 
and second, the test product is compared to Insuplant, which is approved in France, but not in other 
European countries. The two insulins in the CIPII group were not randomized (sequence) nor double 
blind. All patients in the CIPII group started with the Insuplant insulin. Therefore all start-related AEs 
were in this group. Randomization of the sequence would have prevented this problem. In addition, 
not all patients in the study belonged to the target population, inclusion criteria permitted patients to 
entry the study when not sufficiently controlled after at least three months of intensive insulin 
treatment. This period is too short to start the rather invasive therapy of CIPII. The appropriate patient 
population has been studied in the HUBIN trial.  
A hierarchical testing procedure has been employed with first testing primary hypotheses, and if 
statistically significant, secondary hypotheses could be tested. Note that the statistical plan did not 
explicitly specify whether non-inferiority was claimed if both or either of the two primary endpoints 
would be statistically significant. Since both endpoints are designated primary, both endpoints have to 
show non-inferiority.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, the only difference between Insuplant and Insuman Implantable is the origin of the Insulin. It 
is porcine for Insuplant and recombinant insulin for Insuman. Insuplant is registered in France since 
1998, which is a reassuring element. The fact that the manufacturing of Insuplant has been 
discontinued is an element of major importance for the evaluation of this file, as the patients which are 
already using the implantable pump need an insulin formulation that can be used with the pump. There 
are no objections for the new formulation of insulin itself, and the pump is already registered. This 
assessment however, covers the evaluation of the whole system of administration. 
The comparative phase of the HUBIN study provides data on comparison between Insuplant and 
Insuman IP administration. As noted above the findings are reassuring and Insuman and Insuplant are 
considered interchangeable. 
Although the HbA1c values were higher in the non-comparative phases of the Hubin trial, they 
remained stable during the study phase. 
The refill accuracy error percentage did not substantially change in the Insuman non-comparative 
phase. However, the error percentages were higher than in the Insuman comparative phase. Possibly 
due to a selection bias related with the inclusion criteria of the comparative phase. 
In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial, actual and theoretical daily insulin doses 
and the dose used during the last 24 hours of each cycle did shift from cycle 8 to 10.  This most likely 
represents the heterogeneity of the insulin need of patients at different cycles in this study arm. 
As obese subjects need larger amounts of insulin the Applicant performed an analysis of the reduction 
in HbA1c and AEs according to BMI category. Efficacy and safety were comparable for the different 
categories. No differences between weight classes were observed for refill accuracy.  
As data are understandably limited on IP insulin administration, it should be clear that the marketing 
authorisation only concerns patients in which SC treatment by insulin pump has become problematic. 
Only type 1 diabetics have been included in the HUBIN trial. Historical data also provide very limited 
data in regard to treatment of type 2 diabetes patients and to our knowledge no PK data exist, which 
might be of relevance as visceral fat may influence PK in type 2 diabetes patients. In addition, insulin 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 39/79 
 
 
requirements are often higher in type 2 diabetic patients because of hepatic and peripheral insulin 
resistance. This would render pump refills and subsequent risk of infection more frequent and thus 
affect the risk/benefit profile of IP insulin administration. Furthermore, problematic glycaemic 
fluctuations and severe hypoglycaemia are much rarer in type 2 patients. This is probably reflected by 
the fact that only type 1 diabetics were available for recruitment in the HUBIN trial and is reflected in 
the SmPC. In addition, in type 2 diabetes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is much more frequent than in 
type 1 diabetics, adding to the concern of a potential risk for liver steatosis when insulin is 
administered through IP route. 
Given the high risk associated with CIPII, it is clear that the marketing authorisation should be very 
restricted and limited to the type 1 diabetic or c-peptide negative population as represented in the 
HUBIN trial. IP insulin administration has only limited historical data and the HUBIN trial 
understandably is also limited due to its size. This is a reflection of the limited population in which IP 
administration is truly advisable. It should be a last resort in patients unresponsive to SC insulin 
treatment, including subcutaneous pump therapy, with subcutaneous insulin resistance, or high and 
unexplained glycaemic fluctuations leading to frequent and unpredictable severe hypoglycaemia and/or 
recurrent severe hyperglycaemia.  
In study MIP 310 comparing CIPII to SC administration, the results on HbA1C of Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/ml were not very strong. At the end of the study the HbA1C was 7.78 in the CIPII group and 
8.19 in the SC group (as treated analysis). The results in the CIPII group are sufficiently good as SC 
treatment but the power of this trial was not ideal: it should be noted that the number of patients 
treated with Insuman Implantable is small: 52 patients treated for 6 months. However, if the indication 
for the CIPII with Insuman Implantable is limited to a population in which SC administration has 
become problematic, this is sufficient. The Applicant has performed a post-hoc analysis in a sub-group 
of patients with use of CSII, HbA1c >7.5%, mean self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) value >180 
mg/dL. It can be debated whether this is the real EVADIAC group; however, in any case these are 
patients with insufficient glycaemic control. Effect on HbA1c with IP treatment was superior to that 
with SC treatment. 
The inclusion criteria were HbA1c ≤9% and percentage error at refill equal or below 20%. The HbA1c 
values were indeed higher in the Insuman non-comparative phase than in the comparative phase.  This 
is not expected to have an influence on the non-inferiority of Insuman Implantable versus Insuplant. 
However, this has a small influence on the safety and reliability of the therapy in the true therapeutic 
population.  
In the HUBIN comparative phase, one fifth of the study population was excluded from the ITT 
population for refill accuracy due to “no valid post-baseline refill value”. For each patient, the experts – 
blinded from the treatment allocation – did consider whether the refill accuracy error percentage 
values pattern was consistent or if one or several values had to be invalidated. This was not related to 
the actual value. Due to the limited number of points for each patient (5) when more than 2 values 
were suspicious, it was decided to invalidate the whole patient as it was impossible to determine which 
values were reflecting the reality. Refill accuracy will therefore be overestimated due to exclusion of 
patients with a bad refill accuracy. 
Also in the Insuman non-comparative phase of the Hubin trial about 15 to 20% of the patients in the 
different cycles were not included in the population used for evaluation of refill accuracy. In the 
Insuplant non-comparative phase, HbA1c measurements were not performed at each refill cycle, which 
explains the lower number of data points.  
In the comparative phase of the Hubin trial there were similar rates of patients in the two treatment 
groups who received at least one other insulin injection “rescue insulin” during the study: 11/84 
patients of the Insuman Implantable group versus 10/84 patients of the Insuplant group. 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 40/79 
 
 
Subcutaneous “rescue insulin” was used most of the time during delivery system dysfunction (catheter 
occlusion, PPC issue): 9/11 patients in the Insuman group and 7/10 patients in the Insuplant group. In 
the Insuman non-comparative phase, 39.1 % of the ITT population used subcutaneous insulin at least 
once during the study phase. Subcutaneous insulin was used most of the time during delivery system 
dysfunction (62% of the cases) and metabolic control issues.  
The applicant commits to submit the integrated report containing the complete data of all phases of 
the HUBIN study (Insuplant non-comparative phase, Insuman/Insuplant comparative phase and 
Insuman non-comparative phase) as this is not yet available. The applicant is requested to submit this 
report in October 2014 as a post authorisation commitment. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Given the high risk associated with CIPII, it is clear that the marketing authorisation should be very 
restricted. It should be a last resort in patients unresponsive to SC insulin treatment, including 
subcutaneous pump therapy, presenting with frequent, otherwise unexplained severe hyper- and/or 
hypoglycaemia.  
On the basis of the current evidence, Insuman Implantable and Insuplant are considered 
interchangeable. 
The HbA1c values in the patients in the Hubin trial treated with Insuman Implantable via CIPII were 
stable. The mean refill accuracy error percentage did not change substantially. 
Exclusion of patients with invalid post-baseline refill values due to inconsistent refill accuracy error 
percentages will select the patient population with less variability. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Several risks of using Insuman Implantable are similar to those observed with insulin in general, such 
as severe hypoglycaemia, antigenicity, hypersensitivity and hyperglycaemia which are also identified 
risks for Insuman with SC routes of administration. Since Insuman Implantable is administered 
through an implanted intra-peritoneal pump there are additional risks related to the placement of the 
pump and device issues. Additionally, focal hepatic steatosis has been observed with CIPII using 
Insuplant when the catheter was positioned very close to or in a liver capsule and is a risk with 
Insuman Implantable. 
The safety evaluation includes the two main studies (HUBIN and MIP 310), which were studies in type 
1 diabetes to demonstrate efficacy and safety of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL and Insuplant 400 
IU/mL in an intra-peritoneal pump, the MIP 2007 pump model. Additional safety information is 
provided from additional Insuplant studies. Particular attention is paid to metabolic and nutritional 
AE/SAE including their relationship to ADAs (anti-insulin antibodies) levels. No special approaches to 
monitoring were used. 
Patient exposure 
The patient exposure of the studies that contributed to the safety database is presented in the 
following table:

On average the patients in HUBIN were older with longer duration of diabetes and more complications 
than MIP 310 and would therefore be expected to have more AEs and more hypoglycaemia. The 
primary safety evaluation was based on the HUBIN study, which provides the safety assessment of 
Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL compared to Insuplant 400 IU/mL, of Insuplant in the non-
comparative phase and of Insuman Implantable throughout the entire study. The safety assessment 
was based on the safety population, which was composed of all randomized patients exposed to the 
study drug, i.e., who received at least one administration of the study drug. 
Patients in MIP 310 had type 1 diabetes, HbA1c levels ≥7.5% and had been receiving intensive SC 
insulin therapy, CSII or MDI, for at least three months prior to enrolment. In MIP 310, the CIPII and 
SC groups were comparable with regard to baseline and demographic characteristics. 
The safety assessment in MIP 310 is also based on the safety population, which was defined as all 
patients who completed Visit 3 (Start of Treatment). For the study phase, the safety data was 
primarily summarized by comparing CIPII and SC treatments. Additional summaries of AEs in the CIPII 
group during the Insuplant treatment period (first 6 months of the study phase) and the Insuman 
Implantable treatment period (the second 6 months of the study phase) were also provided. For 
continuation and maintenance phases, AEs from the continuation phase (Insuman Implantable 
treatment) and the maintenance phase (Insuplant treatment) were summarized.   
In study MIP 310, patients implanted with the Medtronic MiniMed Pump, received two insulin 
formulations via the MIP 2007 model during the 360 day study phase; Insuplant 400 IU/mL for the 
first 180 days and Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL for the second 180 days. Only 51 of the 52 
randomized patients received Insuman Implantable. Forty-nine (49) patients then entered a 
continuation phase with Insuman Implantable up to 1 year. The overall extent of exposure to Insuman 
Implantable was 109.75 patient-years. 
In supportive studies 302, 302H, CU, 303 and 307, in type 1 diabetic patients, study populations were 
comparable in their extent of exposure in clinical trials.

The comparative and non-comparative Insuplant phases of study HUBIN (Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL versus Insuplant 400 IU/mL for 6 months and Insuplant 400 IU/mL for 6 months) have 
been completed. Eighty four (84) patients were exposed to Insuman Implantable. The overall extent of 
exposure to Insuman Implantable was 37.33 patient-years. 
To ensure treatment continuation of all patients using a Medtronic MiniMed Implantable insulin pump 
system after the discontinuation and end of availability of Insuplant in June 2011, the patients are 
receiving Insuman Implantable in an open-label Insuman Implantable non-comparative extension 
phase of the HUBIN study, which is planned to run until the product is approved and marketed. An 
interim analysis was performed on 417 patients included. The mean time on the study drug, known for 
409 patients was 388 ± 100 days (median: 370 days). This population is closely followed every 45 
days at time of pump refill. 
Given the small number of subjects in the target population for CIPII, this small number is justified. 
The Insuman Implantable non-comparative phase of HUBIN provides data on 412 patients. Patients 
will enter a registry to further characterize the safety of this treatment in real life practice. This registry 
is part of the pharmacovigilance plan; it is planned to run for 10 years with interim analysis reported 
on a yearly basis. 
Adverse events  
HUBIN Study: Comparative phase 
Overall, the nature and the frequency of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the HUBIN 
study were in accordance with the safety profile of any insulin therapy, and globally, display of 
treatment-emergent adverse events was well balanced between the two treatment groups.  
During treatment period, TEAEs were reported in 52.4% of the patients of the safety population (56% 
in Insuman Implantable group versus 48.8% in Insuplant group) and were considered as possibly 
related for 11.3% (14.3% in Insuman Implantable group versus 8.3% in Insuplant group, Table 6). 
The respective incidences are shown in Table 7. The rate of possibly related TEAEs was 0.45 per 
patient-year exposure for the Insuman comparative phase and 0.37 for the Insuplant comparative 
phase. The statistical and clinical significance of this small difference in TEAEs and possibly related 
TEAEs in the two groups is not known since the groups are small and the trial was only over 4 refill 
cycles of 160 days.

Table 7. Incidence of TEAEs in the HUBIN comparative phase 
The most frequent TEAEs were infections and infestations (21.4% of the patients), metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (13.7%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (7.1%) and general 
disorders and administration site conditions (6.5%)(Table 8). 
Table 8. TEAEs by SOC 
At least one TEAE was considered as possibly related to the insulin and/or to the pump in 19 patients 
(11.3 %): 12 patients from the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL group (14.3%) and 7 patients from 
the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group (8.3%) (Table 9).

The System Organ Class most often affected by possibly related TEAEs was metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (8.3 % [7/84] of the patients in Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL group and 4.8% [4/84] of 
the patients in the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group), which included hyperglycaemia (3 patients treated 
with Insuman versus 2 patients treated with Insuplant), acetonaemia (1 patient treated with Insuman 
versus 3 patients treated with Insuplant), hypoglycaemic unconsciousness (2 patients treated with 
Insuman versus 1 patient treated with Insuplant), hypoglycaemia (1 patient treated with Insuman), 
and hypoglycaemic seizure (1 patient treated with Insuman). 
General disorders and administrative site conditions were considered as possibly related to treatment 
in 4.8% of the patients in Insuman group and 2.4% of the patients in Insuplant group; these patients 
presented device occlusion (3.6% (N=3) in Insuman group versus 2.4% (N=2) in Insuplant group) or 
catheter site pain (1.2% (N=1) in Insuman group versus 0% in Insuplant group). 
Other TEAE possibly related to the insulin and/or to the pump were nervous system disorders (1.2% in 
the Insuman group versus 2.4% in the Insuplant group), which were hypoglycaemic comas in 1 patient 
treated with Insuman and 2 patients treated with Insuplant and gastrointestinal disorders (2.4% in the 
Insuman group versus 1.2% in the Insuplant group), which were abdominal pain (2 patients treated 
with Insuman) and umbilical hernia (1 patient treated with Insuplant). Hepatic steatosis was 
considered as related to the study drug in 1 patient of the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group (without known 
hepatic steatosis reported at inclusion); as was medical device change (pump change) in 1 patient of 
the same treatment group. 
No clinically significant changes in weight, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed at 
V2, V3, V4 and V5. 
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
In the HUBIN study the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was a safety endpoint. The definition of 
serious hypoglycaemia was similar of the other studies in that the event led to loss of consciousness 
requiring administration of a parenteral countermeasure by a third party, seizure, or a visit to an 
emergency department. 
Table 10. Hyperglycaemias and hypoglycaemias in the HUBIN comparative phase 
The number of patients with symptomatic hypoglycaemia and their number of events during the week 
before each post-treatment visit was summarized and no clinically significant difference was observed 
between the two treatment groups. During the comparative phase, there were 12 patients (14.3%) in 
Insuman Implantable group and 11 patients (13.1%) in Insuplant group who presented with at least 
one severe hypoglycaemic event. One patient in Insuman Implantable group and 3 patients in the 
Insuplant group had at least one nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic event  
The number of patients experiencing at least one episode of severe hypoglycaemia in the comparative 
arm of HUBIN was balanced between the 2 groups. Annual incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 
0.451 vs. 0.343 episodes per patient-year for Insuman Implantable versus Insuplant. 
There were 5 patients in each arm that had serious AEs for hypoglycaemia, and most frequent serious 
TEAEs were metabolism and nutrition disorders in 6.0% of patients (5 patients) in both the Insuman 
Implantable and Insuplant groups: hypoglycaemic unconsciousness for 3 patients in each group, 
hypoglycaemia for 1 patient in each group and hypoglycaemic seizure for 1 patient of each group. 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013

Sixty nine (69) patients (82.1%) in the Insuman Implantable group and 67 patients (79.8%) in the 
Insuplant group had at least one hyperglycaemia event during the comparative phase. Among them, 
13 Insuman Implantable patients (15.5%) and 15 Insuplant patients (17.9%) had at least one event of 
hyperglycaemia with ketonemia. Hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia with ketonemia were not 
required to be reported as AEs unless specific criteria were met. Ketonemia >0.5 mmol/L had to be 
reported as AE. None of the events were reported as SAEs. Only diabetic ketoacidosis would be 
reported as an SAE and there were no events in either group during the comparative phase of HUBIN. 
The incidence of hyper- and hypoglycaemia observed in the comparative phase of the study is higher 
compared to the incidence observed in the other observational phases (described below). However, 
after review of the events, no meaningful differences among the study phases were noted. 
HUBIN study: Insuplant Non-Comparative Phase 
The following tables present an overall summary of the TEAEs together with their incidence rates. 
Table 11. TEAEs in the HUBIN Insuplant non-comparative phase 
Table 12. Incidence of TEAEs in the HUBIN Insuplant non-comparative phase 
The nature and the frequency of treatment emergent adverse events were in accordance with the 
known safety profile of insulin. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 40.2 % of the 
patients and were considered as possibly related to insulin and/or pump for 11.0 % of the patients. 
The incidence of possibly related TEAEs was 0.31 per patient-year exposure. Possibly related TEAE 
were mainly TEAE related to the pump: administration site disorders in 10 patients (6.1 %) and 
medical device change or removal in 5 patients (3.0 %). Other TEAE possibly related to the insulin 
and/or to the pump were hyperglycaemia in 2 patients (1.2 %), acetonaemia in 1 patient (0.6 %) and 
brittle diabetes in 1 patient (0.6 %). 
No clinically significant changes in mean weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed at 
V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6. 
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
An increase of the rate of patients with symptomatic hypoglycaemia was observed at 2nd (58.9 %), 
3rd (64.5 %) and 4th (58.4 %) cycle compared to 1st cycle (46.4 %).

Table 13. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in the HUBIN Insuplant non-comparative phase 
Six patients (3.7 %) presented at least one severe hypoglycaemia during the study phase. The number 
of severe hypoglycaemias per patient-year was 0.140. In 5 patients (3.1 %) the severe hypoglycaemia 
was diurnal and in 1 patient the moment was not determined. Four of these 6 patients had high level 
( ≥ 10 %) of free anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at inclusion. 
About half of the patients (49.1 %) presented at least one hyperglycaemia during the study phase and 
10 patients (6.1 %) at least one hyperglycaemia with ketonemia. The number of hyperglycaemia per 
patient-year was 8.272 and the number of hyperglycaemia with ketonemia per patient-year 0.187. No 
patient experienced protocol defined diabetic ketoacidosis (pH < 7.25).

Table 14. TEAEs in the HUBIN Insuman non-comparative phase 
Table 15. Incidence of TEAEs in the HUBIN Insuman non-comparative phase 
The incidence of possibly related TEAEs were overall similar in all treatment groups, regardless 
whether or not they had been enrolled in the comparative phase. 
Overall, 76.5 % of the ITT population reported at least one TEAE, at least one TEAE was considered as 
possibly related to treatment in 28.1 % of patients, and as serious adverse events in 41.2% of patients.  
No clinically significant change from baseline was observed at each cycle for weight, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure.

Possibly related TEAE were mainly TEAE related to the pump: 
• Medical device change, implantation or removal in 45 patients (10.8 %). 
•  Administration  site  disorders  in  41  patients  (9.8  %),  half  of  these  device  occlusion  (20 
patients: 4.8 %). 
Other TEAE possibly related to the insulin and/or to the pump were: 
•  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  in  36  patients  (8.6  %):  hyperglycaemia  (16  patients: 
3.8 %), hypoglycaemia (7 patients: 1.7 %), diabetes inadequate control (4 patients: 1.0 %), 
acetonaemia (4 patients: 1.0 %), ketoacidosis (2 patients: 0.5 %), ketosis (2 patients: 0.5 %) 
hypoglycaemic  unconsciousness  (5  patients:  1.2  %)  and  hypoglycaemic  seizure  (2  patients: 
0.5 %).

• Infections in 7 patients (1.7 %), including implant site infection (5 patients: 1.2 %), device 
related infection (1 patient: 0.2 %) and diabetic foot infection (1 patient: 0.2 %). 
• Gastro-intestinal disorders in 4 patients (1.0 %), including abdominal pain (4 patients: 1.0 %) 
and diarrhoea (1 patient: 0.2 %). 
• Nervous system disorders in 4 patients (1.0 %), including hypoglycaemic coma (3 patients: 
0.7 %) and loss of consciousness (1 patient: 0.2 %). 
• Blood glucose fluctuation in 3 patients (0.7 %). 
• Skin disorders in 3 patients (0.7 %), including erythema (1 patient: 0.2 %), skin erosion (1 
patient: 0.2 %) and scar (1 patient: 0.2 %). 
No hepatobiliary disorder was related to insulin or pump. 
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
Table 17. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in the HUBIN Insuman non-comparative phase 
The rate of patients with at least one symptomatic hypoglycaemia during the last week of each cycle 
did not significantly change. It was 58.1 % at baseline (cycle 0) and then varied between 54.2 % and 
61.2 %. 
62 patients (14.9 %) presented at least one severe hypoglycaemia and 96 episodes were reported 
during the study phase. In 45 patients (10.8 %) the severe hypoglycaemia were only diurnal, in 14 
patients (3.4 %) only nocturnal and 3 patients (0.7 %) had severe hypoglycaemia diurnal and 
nocturnal. The number of severe hypoglycaemia per patient-year was 0.218. 
During the study phase, 318 patients (77.2 %) presented at least one hyperglycaemia, and 78 patients 
(18.9 %) at least one hyperglycaemia with ketonemia. The number of hyperglycaemia per patient-year 
was 9.276 and the number of hyperglycaemia with ketonemia per patient-year 0.952. Compared to the 
Insuplant non-comparative phase, the number of hyperglycaemia per patient year was higher during 
the Insuman non-comparative phase (9.276 versus 8.272) as well as the number of hyperglycaemia 
with ketonemia per patient-year (0.952 versus 0.187). 
None of the patients of the ITT population presented protocol defined diabetic ketoacidosis during the 
study phase. 
Study – MIP 310 
Study Phase 
In the study MIP 310, done in patients with type 1 diabetes who were naive to intra-peritoneal insulin, 
the incidence of ‘severe hypoglycaemic events’ was a primary efficacy parameter. Severe 
hypoglycaemic events were defined as ‘a clinical episode of hypoglycaemia that required assistance 
from another person’ in the MIP 310 clinical study report (CSR).  
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 49/79 
 
 
 
The available data are not sufficient to test the statistical difference between the CIPII and SC groups 
in MIP 310. 
The analysis and reporting of events of (non-severe) hypoglycaemia were not officially required in MIP 
310 and, in accordance with this, there is no definition of (non-severe) hypoglycaemia in the MIP 310 
CSR. Adverse events of ‘hypoglycaemia’ were however reported in the MIP 310 CSR. In MIP 310, there 
were 25 events of hypoglycaemia; 23 in the CIPII group and 2 in the SC group.  
In the CIPII group alone, there were 13 AEs of hypoglycaemia during 6 months of Insuplant 400 IU/mL 
treatment and 10 AEs of hypoglycaemia during 6 months of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL 
treatment. 
There were 6 events of severe hypoglycaemia in 4 patients during MIP 310; 2 events in 2 patients in 
the CIPII group and 4 events in 2 patients in the SC group. The available data are not sufficient to test 
the statistical difference between the 2 groups. 
In the CIPII group alone, there were 2 severe hypoglycaemic events during 6 months of treatment 
with Insuplant 400 IU/mL and no severe hypoglycaemic events during 6 months of treatment with 
Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL. 
Continuation and Maintenance Phases 
There were 191 AEs during the continuation and maintenance Phases (134 during the continuation 
phase, 57 during the maintenance phase). The frequency of these AEs per 100 patient-years was 
151.5 (155.6 during the continuation phase, 142.6 during the maintenance phase). The frequency of 
AEs was higher in the continuation phase than the maintenance phase. 
There were 46 AEs probably or possibly related to the MIP System or study insulin (37 during the 
continuation phase, 9 during the maintenance phase). The frequency of these AEs per 100 patient 
years was 38.1 (43.0 during the continuation phase, 22.5 during the maintenance phase). The 
frequency of AEs probably or possibly related to the MIP System or study insulin was higher in the 
continuation phase than the maintenance phase. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No patient died during the comparative phase of the Hubin study or during the MIP 310 study. 
In the Insuplant non-comparative phase of the Hubin trial, one patient died due to a malignant lung 
neoplasm with liver and bone metastases. 
In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the Hubin trial, 2 patients (0.5%) died due to severe cardiac 
disorders for one and a cerebrovascular accident for the other. 
Pivotal Study – HUBIN: Comparative phase 
In the Hubin study, 15.5% of the patients (16.7% (14 patients) in Insuman Implantable and 14.3% 
(12 patients) in Insuplant) reported at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event during the 
study (Table 18).

Table 18. Serious treatment emergent adverse events 
Most frequent serious TEAEs were metabolism and nutrition disorders in 6.0 % (5 patients) in each 
group: hypoglycaemic unconsciousness for 3 patients in each group, hypoglycaemia for 1 patient in 
each group and hypoglycaemic seizure for 1 patient of each group. 
The other SOCs with the highest incidences of SAEs were: 
1.  General disorders and administration site conditions in 5 patients in the Insuman Implantable 
group and 3 patients in the Insuplant group (6.0% versus 3.6%): device occlusion in 4 patients in 
the Insuman Implantable group and 2 patients in the Insuplant group, catheter site pain in 1 
patient in the Insuman Implantable group and impaired healing (of the skin after pump re-
implantation) in 1 patient in the Insuplant group. 
2.  Nervous system disorders for 2 patients in each treatment group (2.4%) who experienced 
hypoglycaemic coma. 
3.  Infections and infestations for 1 patient with herpes zoster in the Insuman Implantable group (1.2 
%) and 1 patient with abscess in the Insuplant group (1.2 %). 
4.  Surgical and medical procedures for 1 patient whose drug delivery device was removed in the 
Insuman Implantable group (1.2 %) and for 1 patient whose medical device was changed in the 
Insuplant group (1.2 %).

Pivotal Study – HUBIN: Insuplant non-comparative phase 
One patient died due to a malignant lung neoplasm with liver and bone metastases.  
Serious treatment emergent adverse event were experienced by 18.3 % of the patients. About half of 
the serious TEAE were events concerning the pump (14 patients – 8.5 %) and most often serious TEAE 
were related to the pump and not the insulin (13 patients – 7.9 %). One device occlusion was related 
to the insulin and to the pump and 1 hypoglycaemic coma to the insulin but not to the pump. 
Pivotal Study – HUBIN: Insuman non-comparative phase 
Two patients (0.5 %) died during the non-comparative phase Insuman (before the cut-off date 30 June 
2012): one due to cerebrovascular accident, the other due to atrial fibrillation with ventricular 
dysfunction. None of these fatal events was reported as related to the insulin or to the pump. 
• A 69 year old female patient who started Insuman with Medtronic Mini Med Implantable 
Pump on 16-Jun-2011 and experienced severe stroke and heart attack leading to 360 days 
after the first Insuman administration. This cerebrovascular accident was considered as not 
associated with the insulin and not associated with the pump. 
• A 64 year old female patient who started Insuman with Medtronic Mini Med Implantable 
Pump on 29-Jun-2011 and experienced, first, a cerebrovascular accident after atrial fibrillation 
(AF) 138 days after first Insuman administration, then, died 169 days after the first Insuman 
administration secondary to tachycardia, AF and bad function of the left ventricle. These were 
considered as not associated with the insulin and not associated with the pump. 
An overview of the serious TEAEs is given in Table 19.  Overall, 172 patients (41.2 %) presented at 
least one serious TEAE (including the fatal events) during the Insuman non comparative phase (before 
the cut-off date for interim analysis). 
Most frequent serious TEAEs were in relation with the pump: 
• Surgical and medical procedures (58 patients: 13.9 %) mainly composed of medical device 
changes, implantations or removals (53 patients: 12.7 %). 
• General disorders and administration site conditions (40 patients: 9.6 %) including almost 
exclusively medical device occlusion, failure, malfunction and complications (with the exception 
of general physical health deterioration in 1 patient, chest pain in 1 patient and oedema 
peripheral in 1 patient). 
Serious TEAEs were most often determined to have a causal relationship with the pump and not 
with the insulin, or neither with the pump nor with the insulin.  
Only, 14 patients (3.4 %) experienced a serious TEAE related to the insulin and not to the pump: 
• Hypoglycaemia in 4 patients 
• Hyperglycaemia in 2 patients 
• Hypoglycaemic unconsciousness in 4 patients 
• Hypoglycaemic coma in 2 patients 
• Loss of consciousness in 1 patient 
• Hypoglycaemic unconsciousness and hypoglycaemic seizure in 1 patient 
And, 5 patients (1.2 %) experienced Serious TEAE related to the insulin and the pump: 
• Hypoglycaemic coma in 1 patient; 
• Hypoglycaemia in 1 patient; 
• Device occlusion in 1 patient; 
• Medical device change in 1 patient; 
• Hypoglycaemic seizure, diabetes mellitus inadequate control, medical device complication 
and device occlusion in 1 patient.

Table 19. Serious TEAEs 
In the Insuman non-comparative phase, the incidence rate of SAEs was slightly higher in patients from 
the non-comparative Insuplant arm (1.07 per patient-year exposure) than in patients from the 
Insuman comparative arm (0.79 per patient-year exposure) or from the Insuplant comparative arm 
(0.74 per patient-year exposure). 
The rate of SAEs was higher in the Insuman non-comparative phase (0.93 per patient-year exposure) 
than in the comparative study phase (0.57 per patient-year exposure) and in the Insuplant non-
comparative phase (0.64 per patient-year exposure). 
Study – MIP310 
In MIP 310, there were more SAEs in the CIPII group (12 SAEs in 9 patients) than the SC group (9 
SAEs in 7 patients) during the treatment period. 
Six of the 12 SAEs in the CIPII group were possibly associated with implantation surgery and/or device 
maintenance (SAE Verbatim: ‘skin erosion at pump site’ x 2, ‘post infection of pump pocket’, 
‘laparoscopy to reposition catheter’ and ‘device explant’ x 2). Of the 6 SAEs, the relationship of 5 of the 
SAEs to the study device was described as ‘probable’. There was no information on the relationship of 
the remaining SAE to the study device. Three of the 12 SAEs in the CIPII group were associated with 
the acute complications of diabetes or the treatment of diabetes with insulin (SAE Verbatim: 
‘hypoglycaemia’, ‘severe hypoglycaemia requiring assistance’ and ‘hyperglycaemia’). Of the 3 SAEs, 
the relationship to the study drug was described as ‘probable’ for 2 SAEs and ‘unlikely’ for 1 SAE. 
Seven of 9 SAEs in the SC group were associated with the acute complications of diabetes or the 
treatment of diabetes with insulin (SAE Verbatim: ‘hypoglycaemia’ x 2, ‘severe hypoglycaemia’ x 2, 
‘elevated blood sugar requiring hospitalization’ [Preferred Term: hyperglycaemia], ‘diabetes out of 
control’, ‘dehydration/pump malfunction/catheter kink/ketoacidosis’ [Preferred Term: 
hyperglycaemia]), although the relationship of 6 of the 7 SAEs to comparator drug and/or comparator 
device was described as ‘none’. 
In the CIPII group alone, there were 5 SAEs in patients receiving Insuplant 400 IU/mL during 
6 months of treatment and 7 SAEs in patients receiving Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL during 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 53/79 
 
 
 
 
6 months of treatment. Of the 5 SAEs in CIPII patients receiving Insuplant 400 IU/mL there were 
2 SAEs of ‘severe hypoglycemia’. Of the 7 SAEs in CIPII patients receiving Insuman Implantable 400 
IU/mL there were no SAEs of ‘severe hypoglycemia’. 
In MIP 310, 12 patients discontinued during the study; 5 patients in the CIPII group and 7 patients in 
the SC group. Most patients in the CIPII group, 4 of 5 patients, discontinued due to events associated 
with implantation surgery or device maintenance (‘device complication’ x 2, ‘pump pocket infection’ x 1 
and ‘patient request’ x 1 following catheter occlusion and swelling at the site of surgery). The fifth 
patient (patient request) discontinued following randomization but prior to start of treatment.  Most 
patients in the SC group, 5 of 7 patients, were discontinued due to ‘non-compliance/lost to follow-up’.  
Continuation and Maintenance Phases 
There were 40 SAEs during the continuation (Insuman 12 months) and maintenance (Insuplant 12 
months) phases (30 during the continuation phase, 10 during the maintenance phase). The frequency 
of SAEs per 100 patient-years was 31.7 (34.8 during the continuation phase, 25.0 during the 
maintenance phase). The frequency of SAEs was higher in the continuation phase than the 
maintenance phase. 
There were 26 SAEs probably or possibly related to the MIP System or study insulin (21 during the 
continuation phase, 5 during the maintenance phase). The frequency of SAEs probably or possibly 
related to the MIP System or study insulin per 100 patient-years was 20.6 (24.4 during the 
continuation phase, 12.5 during the maintenance phase). The frequency of SAEs probably or possibly 
related to the MIP System or study insulin was higher in the continuation phase than the maintenance 
phase. 
Overall, in the MIP 310 study, the higher number of SAEs in the IP group might be expected since 
CIPII patients underwent a surgical procedure for the implantation of the device. Six of the SAEs were 
possibly associated with implantation surgery and/or device maintenance. Although the SAEs cannot 
be attributed to the insulin used, they are the consequence of the method used and as such are 
relevant for the comparison with current treatment methods (SC). 
Device interventions and infectious complications 
Device interventions 
In the comparative phase of HUBIN the refill cycle was 40 days ± 5 days, in the non-comparative 
Insuman arm this was 45 days, both are of shorter duration compared to MIP 310 where the refills 
were done every 90 days. A 10 minute rinse was done at study entry into the comparative phase for 
all patients prior to randomization and no prophylactic rinses were done in either the comparative 
phase or the Insuman Implantable non-comparative phase. Reactive rinses in both phases of the study 
were done in response to a change in refill accuracy, change in insulin dose or persistent 
hyperglycemia.   
In the comparative phase of HUBIN, 9 patients (10.7%) in both treatment groups needed at least one 
extra refill during the study. Twelve (12) patients (14.3%) of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL 
group and 18 (21.4%) of the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group had at least one rinsing procedure during the 
study and 1 patient (1.2%) of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL group and 2 patients of the 
Insuplant 400 IU/mL group had at least one pump blockage, defined as blockage after a 4 hour NaOH 
rinse. In some cases pump blockage occurred during or just after the rinsing procedure required at 
study entry. There were a total of 19 patients (11.3%) that needed at least one device intervention 
during the study, that consisted of either pump, catheter, or PPC interventions; 8 (9.5%) of the 
patients of the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL group and 11 (13.1%) of the patients of the Insuplant

given in Table 20. 
Table 20. Incidence of device interventions in the HUBIN comparative phase 
In the Insuman non-comparative arm of HUBIN, 170 patients (40.8%) needed 255 extra-refill, 6 
patients (1.4%) experienced a pump blockage and 70 pump explantations were performed in 68 
patients (16.3%), two patients having experienced two pump explantations. An overview of the 
incidences of device interventions in the Insuman non-comparative phase is given in Table 21. 
Table 21. Incidence of device interventions in the HUBIN Insuman non-comparative phase 
344 patients (82.5%) needed 572 rinsing procedures. The mean delay of rinsing procedures after the 
preceding one was 151 days for the first, 191 days for the second, 151 days for the third and 88 days 
for the fourth. The reasons for rinsing procedures are tabulated in Table 22. The main reason of rinsing 
procedures was an increase of refill accuracy error percentage (53.6% of the rinsing procedures).

Table 22. Reasons of rinsing procedures - ITT population 
186 patients (44.6%) needed at least one other device intervention during Insuman non-comparative 
phase, that consisted of either pump interventions (121 patients – 29.0%), catheter interventions (133 
patients – 31.9%), or PPC interventions (78 patients – 18.7%). There was no case of intervention for 
refill kit or MiniMed needle. 
The number of device interventions during the Insuman non-comparative phase were generally higher 
in patients previously treated with Insuplant in the Insuplant non-comparative phase (or directly 
enrolled in Insuman non-comparative phase) when compared with other groups. This could be due to 
different baseline characteristics, e.g. the larger time from current pump implantation in the Insuplant 
non-comparative phase than in the comparative phase. The high number of device events reflects the 
complexity of the technique (even if it could also be explained by the fact that 14% of patients had a 
pump older than 6 years at study entry). 
The incidence of device interventions in the HUBIN Insuplant non-comparative phase is summarized in 
Table 23. 
Table 23. Incidence of device interventions in the HUBIN Insuplant non-comparative phase 
The incidence rates for Insuman and Insuplant non-comparative phases are comparable, but there was 
a higher number of extra refills in the Insuman non-comparative phase. 
In MIP 310, there were 79 device interventions with a similar number of catheter complications (n=35) 
and pump complications (n=32) and fewer PPC complications (n=12). There were device interventions 
which were described as such, but were done routinely. 
The Applicant has explained that 35 device interventions in the MIP 310 Study Phase were no real 
complications but routine procedures done at refill. From the genuine device interventions (44), 
underdelivery of insulin was the most occurring complication (15 events in 10 patients) followed by 
occlusion (7 events in 6 patients). With shortening of the refill procedure and the prophylactic sodium

hydroxide rinse procedure introduced in later phases of the study, the number of flush and rinse 
interventions decreased. Data from the Continuation and Maintenance Phases of the MIP 310 study 
indicate that the most common AEs were hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. The incidence of 
hyperglycaemia due to underdelivery and occlusion can be expected to be less in the current situation 
with the improved prophylactic rinse procedure. 
Infectious complications  
Infectious complications may result in pump explantation. In the comparative phase of HUBIN, one 
patient (Insuman Implantable group) had the pump explanted for 5 months due to pocket infection. 
The patient was treated with antibiotics and the pump was re-implanted without additional 
complications prior to the end of the comparative phase. This subject was considered a protocol 
deviation for use of rescue insulin for more than 7 days and was excluded from efficacy analysis. A 
second patient (Insuplant group) experienced a cutaneous infection at the pump site. The infection was 
treated with antibiotic for 7 days and the patient recovered. The patient remained on pump treatment 
during the course of the event. 
In MIP 310, the three pump pocket infections led to pump explantation; 1 pump was replaced, and 2 
other pumps were not replaced. 
In earlier studies using only Insuplant (studies 302, 302H, CU, 303 and 307), the number of device 
events per patient-year decreased in accordance with the study chronology (start of study) from 2.08 
events per patient year in Study 302 to 0.36 events per patient year in Study 307. These studies were 
carried out between 1989 and 2000. This decrease could reflect the development of the MIP and the 
insulin formulation. 
Anti-Insulin Antibodies 
Anti-insulin antibodies (ADAs) may result in hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. In general, levels of 
ADAs rise with initiation of any insulin treatment, which is exaggerated when intra-peritoneal insulin is 
used.  
Pivotal Study – HUBIN: Comparative Phase 
In HUBIN, patients were already on established treatment with an intra-peritoneal pump and would be 
expected to have elevated anti-insulin antibody titers and would not be expected to have a further rise 
in titers during the trial given the similarity of Insuman Implantable and Insuplant. 
The numbers of patients with normal and abnormal levels of ADAs at each visit are presented in Table 
24. The repartition of patients in each free ADAs class was slightly different between the two groups. 
However, no specific evolution was detected during the comparative phase for both of them.

There was globally no clinically significant difference in the repartition of ADAs (ELISA) values between 
the treatment groups whatever the visit (Table 25).

Pivotal Study – HUBIN: Insuplant Non-Comparative Phase 
An overview of abnormal free anti-insulin antibodies (≥ 2.5 %) values is given in Table 26. The rate of 
patients with abnormal values of free AIAs did not change substantially, between 75 % and 87 %, 
during the Insuplant non comparative phase. The only exception was at V6; however, the small 
number of evaluated patients at V6 prevents a meaningful comparison. 
Table 26. Number of patients with abnormal level of Free AIAs at each visit 
Pivotal Study – HUBIN: Insuman Non- Comparative Phase 
The rate of patients with abnormal values of free AIAs (≥2.5%) or AIAs (ELISA, ≥5.0KU/L) did not 
change substantially during the Insuman non comparative phase: 
• 88.1 % at baseline (cycle 0), then, between 76.2 % and 90.0 % from cycle 1 to cycle 13 for 
free AIAs 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report

•  50.3  %  at  baseline,  then,  between  50.0  %  and  69.2  %  from  cycle  1  to  cycle  13  for  AIAs 
(ELISA). 
Four patients in the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial had a history of anti-insulin 
antibody syndrome. 
Study MIP 310 
In MIP 310, the CIPII group reported much higher mean ADAs values, and frequencies of values 
outside the reference range, compared to both baseline values and SC group values during the 
360 day study phase (Table 27). Levels of ADAs rose according to baseline stratification. Evaluation of 
the relationship between ADAs values and HbA1c values phase showed no clear correlation between 
these factors. A medical review of all patients in MIP 310 revealed that while some patients exhibited 
elevated ADAs values there was no correlation with clinical signs of Insulin Antibody Syndrome. 
Table 27. Descriptive Statistics for special interest laboratory values by treatment group and study 
visit 
Hepatic Steatosis 
Two patients were diagnosed with hepatic steatosis during the HUBIN study, both patients were on 
Insuplant at the moment of diagnosis. Based on the information provided in the first case the patient 
had a history of unspecified hepatopathy prior to enrolment in the HUBIN study. The patient was 
treated with CIPII for 5 years prior to the diagnosis of hepatopathy. Medical history and use of 
concomitant medications may provide an alternative explanation for the aggravation of preexisting 
hepatic condition. In the second case it seems that the catheter was in very close proximity to the liver 
causing focal hepatic steatosis. In both cases it seems that steatosis was not clinically relevant since 
there were no additional AEs or SAEs that could be considered as potentially related to the event. 
Additionally, at the beginning of the study, 8 patients had a history of hepatic steatosis and 4 patients 
of focal hepatic steatosis. Based on the data available, patients had a long standing diagnosis of 
steatosis, ranging since 1983 and 2010. In 11 patients steatosis was deemed as ongoing and in one 
case the event resolved. In 9 patients elevated liver enzymes were not observed while 3 patients had 
GGT increased (one of those patients had increased ALT). Adverse and serious adverse events that 
were observed in HUBIN study do not seem to be related to the issue of hepatic steatosis. 
According to the Applicant, there is no additional clinical relevance of hepatic steatosis. The clinical 
features of subjects with and without steatosis are similar. 
According to Regnell and Lernmark (Regnell & Lernmark, 2011) however, insulin can have a role in the 
stimulation of fat synthesis and steatosis. The cases above indicate that there is a potential for the 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 59/79 
 
 
 
 
development of hepatic and focal steatosis. Additionally, the overall and liver-related mortality are 
increased in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis compared to the general population (Pais & 
Ratziu, 2012). 
The CHMP agreed that the consequences of the accumulation of liver fat remain poorly understood and 
the long term effects such as patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis potentially developing 
cirrhosis, endstage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, should be considered.  
The applicant aims to better characterize the risk of focal hepatic steatosis related to the use of 
Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL in the MiniMed Implantable Pump by means of the following 
additional pharmacovigilance activities: 
• Non-comparative pre-authorization efficacy and safety study until the actual availability of Insuman 
Implantable on the market 
• Insuman Implantable registry when Insuman Implantable is available on the market 
Laboratory findings 
Pivotal Study – HUBIN 
There were no laboratory tests measured. 
Study – MIP 310 
There were only slight variations between treatment groups and within groups for urine creatinine and 
microalbumin. The urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio was similar in the CIPII and SC groups at 
baseline, in terms of actual values and frequency of values outside the reference range. The SC group 
reported a mean ratio of 100.41 and 16 (30.8%) high alerts and the CIPII group reported a mean ratio 
of 98.76 with 15 (30.0%) high alerts at Visit 1. However, at Visit 5, while the SC group reported a 
decrease in mean ratio to 79.65 and decrease in number of high alerts to 10 (22.2%), the mean ratio 
in the CIPII group increased to 156.68 as did the number of high alerts to 18 (36%). This difference in 
ratio values between the SC and CIPII groups remained consistent at Visit 8. The statistical and clinical 
significance of this data is not known. There was no difference in AST and ALT between IP insulin and 
SC insulin. From other studies no data are available on renal function. The Applicant will collect 
microalbumin/creatinine ratio in the registry study which is planned to start once the product is 
marketed.  
Safety in special populations 
Use in the Elderly 
Efficacy for both co-primary endpoints change in HbA1c from baseline to V5 and refill accuracy at V5 
was similar in patients <65 and ≥65. The number of SAEs was slightly higher in those over 65. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Patients who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from participating in all the studies described in 
this report. No pregnancies occurred in the comparative phase of HUBIN or in any of the phases of MIP 
310. However, pregnancies did occur during Study 303a. Of the 6 SAEs in the SOC ‘pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions’, 4 were considered to be ‘not related’ to study drug and/or study 
device. The relationship of the event of ‘foetal macrosomia’ to study drug and/or study device was 
described as ‘unlikely’ and the relationship of the event ‘uterine contractions during pregnancy’ to 
study drug and/or device was described as ‘unlikely’. The safety of CIPII with Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/mL or Insuplant 400 IU/mL in pregnant or lactating patients has not been established. The 
appropriate warnings to this respect have been added to section 4.6 of the SmPC.  
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 60/79 
 
 
A protocol amendment was made for the non-comparative Insuman phase to allow Insuman 
Implantable use in pregnancy. No specific problems have been reported after this amendment. 
Use in Paediatric Patients 
Paediatric patients were excluded from the studies listed in this line extension. However, there is one 
subject in the non-comparative phase of HUBIN who is less than 18. The safety of CIPII with Insuman 
Implantable 400 IU/mL or Insuplant 400 IU/mL in paediatric patients cannot be considered to be 
established. Due to the large size of the implantable pump, implantation in children who have not 
reached adult size may not be feasible. As such a contraindication has been included in section 4.3 of 
the SmPC. References to the paediatric population can also be found in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC.   
Use in obese patients 
Subset analysis was not done in those patients with BMI >30 Kg/m2 in the comparative phase of 
HUBIN. Data from 12 obese patients in the IP group and 6 obese patients in the SC group in the study 
phase of MIP 310 showed similar efficacy data assessed as HbA1c in those with BMI >30 Kg/m2. This is 
evidence that the efficacy is not related to the route of administration.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
None other than those generally reported for all insulin preparations. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the safety population of the HUBIN comparative phase, only 2 patients (1.2%) presented at least 
one adverse event leading to study drug withdrawal: 1 patient whose drug delivery device was 
removed for personal convenience in the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/mL group and 1 patient with an 
impaired healing of the skin after re-implantation in the Insuplant 400 IU/mL group. 
In the Insuplant non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial, 4 patients (2.4 %) presented at least one 
adverse event leading to study drug withdrawal: 2 patients (1.2 %) with medical device occlusion, 1 
patient (0.6 %) with medical device removal and 1 patient (0.6 %) with hyperglycaemia. 
In the ITT population treated with Insuman Implantable in the HUBIN trial, 10 patients (2.4 %) 
presented at least one adverse event leading to study drug withdrawal. 
For 7 patients (1.7 %), the adverse events were in relation with the pump (device battery issue: 
1 patient, device dislocation: 1 patient, drug delivery device removal: 1 patient, implant site 
inflammation: 1 patient, device related infection: 1 patient, implant site infection: 1 patient and skin 
erosion due to pump: 1 patient). 
For the 3 other patients (0.4 %), the adverse events were: 
• Hyperglycaemia with ketosis and cognitive disorders: 1 patient 
• Hypoglycaemia: 1 patient 
• Cerebrovascular accident: 1 patient 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
An important consideration to bear in mind regarding this clinical program is that the number of 
patients is limited due to the small number of patients in the target population. 
Overall, it is clear that an intraperitoneal pump needs to be implanted and regular interventions are 
necessary for refill and flushing. A high number of patients treated with Insuman Implantable in the 
HUBIN study, 44.6%, needed at least one device intervention on an average exposure of 388 days per 
patient. Any problem with the device may have serious consequences. In addition, device interventions 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 61/79 
 
 
are a burden for patients. These device interventions can only be performed in a few specialized 
centres in Europe. 
In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial there was a high number of device events. 
The number of device interventions during the Insuman non-comparative phase were generally higher 
in patients previously treated with Insuplant in the Insuplant non-comparative phase (or directly 
enrolled in Insuman non-comparative phase) when compared with other groups. This could be due to 
different baseline characteristics, e.g. the larger time from current pump implantation in the Insuplant 
non-comparative phase than in the comparative phase. Possibly related TEAEs were mainly related to 
the pump: medical device change, implantation or removal in 10.8% and administration site disorders 
in 9.8%, half of these device occlusions. Other possibly related TEAEs were metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (8.6%) and infections in 1.7%, 6 of these 7 patients this was device or implant site related. 
During the treatment period in MIP 310, there were more serious adverse events in the CIPII group 
(12 SAEs in 9 patients) than the SC group (9 SAEs in 7 patients). In addition, there were 40 SAEs 
during the continuation and maintenance phases (30 during the continuation phase, 10 during the 
maintenance phase). In study 310, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was not different between 
the IP group and the SC group; but numbers were small. Incidence of hypoglycaemia other than 
severe is also an important parameter. Hypoglycaemia was not explicitly defined in the study protocol. 
Nevertheless, in the study phase of MIP 310, there were 25 events of hypoglycaemia; 23 in the CIPII 
group and 2 in the SC group. The increased risk of hypoglycaemia with IP insulin is a serious issue. 
There were no clinically relevant differences in device interventions and infections between Insuman 
and Insuplant.  
In the comparative part of the HUBIN trial, there were more adverse events with Insuman than with 
Insuplant (56.0 vs. 48.8%). In addition, more patients had adverse events possibly related to the 
insulin and/or to the pump during treatment with Insuman compared to Insuplant (12 patients 
(14.3%) vs. 7 patients (8.3%)). These findings suggest that Insuman may have disadvantages in 
comparison to Insuplant. 
In the comparative part of the HUBIN study, the System Organ Class most often affected by possibly 
related TEAEs was metabolism and nutrition disorders (8.3 % [7/84] with Insuman and 4.8% [4/84] 
with Insuplant), which included glucose abnormalities. Annual incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 
0.451 episodes per patient-year with Insuman Implantable and 0.343 episodes per patient-year with 
Insuplant. In the pharmacokinetic study, Cmax and AUC0-4h of Insuman Implantable seemed to be 
higher compared to Insuplant with respectively 70% and 40%. Also in the non-comparative arms the 
number of severe hypoglycaemia was higher with Insuman Implantable than with Insuplant (0.218 per 
patient-year versus 0.140 per patient-year). Although the numbers were small and  the differences 
were not statistically significant, Insuman may be associated with a higher risk for hypoglycaemia.  
Compared to the Insuplant non-comparative phase, the number of hyperglycaemia per patient-year 
was higher during the Insuman non-comparative phase (9.276 versus 8.272) as well as the number of 
hyperglycaemia with ketonemia per patient-year (0.952 versus 0.187). 
In rats and humans, it has been demonstrated that high local insulin levels may induce a focal 
reversible hepatic steatosis. Insulin can have a role in the stimulation of fat synthesis and steatosis. 
(Regnell & Lernmark, 2011)  The long term effects of IP insulin on the liver are unknown. In the HUBIN 
and MIP 310 study, hepatic steatosis was reported in one patient. No AE were observed during the 
study in this patient. However, laboratory measurements demonstrated no differences in liver enzymes 
between IP insulin and SC insulin. 
In the Insuplant non-comparative phase of the  HUBIN trial, one patient died due to a malignant lung 
neoplasm with liver and bone metastases. In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial, 2 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report

Page 62/79 
 
 
patients  (0.5%)  died  due  to  severe  cardiac  disorders  for  one  and  a  cerebrovascular  accident  for  the 
other. 
There was an increase in the urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio with intraperitoneal insulin treatment 
compared to SC treatment. The clinical significance is unclear, but harmful effects in the long term 
should not be excluded; this will be monitored in the planned registry study. There is limited data on 
renal function while on CIPII and this data is from MIP310. Prevalence of nephropathy, use of 
concomitant medications affecting the renin angiotensin system and Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs) related to renal function in the trials are similar to the rates seen in Epidemiology of 
Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) extension of the Diabetes Control and Complications 
Trial (DCCT). The Applicant will collect the microalbumin/creatinine ratio from the sites when available 
per standard of care. Those data will be collected in registry study. 
There was a higher number of anti-insulin antibodies with intraperitoneal insulin treatment compared 
to subcutaneous insulin. The clinical significance is unclear, but there may be harmful effects in the 
long term. There were no clinically relevant differences in antibodies between Insuman and Insuplant. 
IP treatment may cause an exaggerated rise in IA titre. However, this may return to normal with time 
and there does not seem to be a clinical significance of increased IA in the patients treated with CIPII.  
Given the larger amount of insulin that is needed in obese patients, a subset analysis according to BMI 
with respect to efficacy and safety was performed. This analysis revealed that efficacy and safety were 
comparable for the different categories. No differences between weight classes were observed for refill 
accuracy. 
The applicant commits to submit the integrated report containing the complete data of all phases of 
the HUBIN study (Insuplant non-comparative phase, Insuman/Insuplant comparative phase and 
Insuman non-comparative phase) as this is not yet available. The applicant will submit this report in 
October 2014. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Intraperitoneal insulin is only used by a very small group of patients. Compared to subcutaneous 
insulin, intraperitoneal insuman has several disadvantages. IP insulin is associated with more device 
interventions, administration site conditions, infections, hypoglycaemia, microalbuminuria and anti-
insulin antibodies. Information regarding safety in pregnancy/lactation, long-term safety, long-term 
exposure to phenol in intraperitoneal region, and safety in the paediatric population are still missing 
(see section 2.8, Risk Management Plan). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the safety data in the context of a 
MA: 
• Non-comparative pre-authorization efficacy and safety study until the actual availability of Insuman 
Implantable on the market - Submission of the integrated report containing the completed data of all 
phases of the HUBIN study (Insuplant non-comparative phase, Insuman/Insuplant comparative phase 
and Insuman non-comparative phase) in October 2014. 
• Insuman Implantable registry when Insuman Implantable is available on the market – the registry 
will last for 10 years. Interim analyses will be addressed on a yearly basis. 
Insuman X-91

The CHMP considers the above activities sufficient to further characterize the aforementioned 
important identified and potential risks of the product, as well as the missing information on the 
product. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.1 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for insulin human (Insuman) in the treatment of adult patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus that cannot be controlled with subcutaneous insulin (including pump) therapy, 
presenting with frequent, otherwise unexplained severe hyper-and/or hypoglycaemia is acceptable.    
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Insulin can be delivered into the intra-peritoneal cavity via an implanted pump device (MiniMed). 
Insuplant was being used as a concentrated insulin formulation in these pumps. Insuplant contains 
porcine-derived semi-synthetic human insulin as an active substance and received Marketing 
Authorisation in France in August 1998. The manufacturing of this porcine-derived insulin was recently 
stopped due to the insulin being a chemically modified porcine insulin. The recombinant human insulin 
Insuman Implantable was developed as a replacement therapy for Insuplant. The intended use for 
Insuman Implantable, is treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus that cannot be 
controlled with subcutaneous insulin (including pump) therapy, presenting with frequent, otherwise 
unexplained severe hyper-and/or hypoglycaemia. 
Severe hypoglycaemia is defined here according to the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1): 
“An event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagons, or 
other resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce 
seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but 
neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered 
sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.” 
In the present application, two pivotal studies using Insuman have been submitted (HUBIN and Study 
MIP 310). In addition to these, 6 other studies are considered supportive by the applicant; however, 
these studies are of limited relevance as these studies only used intraperitoneal administration of 
Insuplant.  
The newly submitted HUBIN study was performed in order to directly compare Insuman and Insuplant. 
This was a randomised non-inferiority trial comparing 84 patients using Insuman with 84 patients 
using Insuplant during 6 months. The patients in this study are relevant for the use of Insuman in 
clinical practice. The number of patients completing the HUBIN study was similar with Insuman and 
Insuplant. After 6 months, HbA1c was 0.1% lower with Insuman compared to Insuplant. Non-
inferiority of the HbA1c change from baseline after 4 refill cycles was reached. The upper limit of the 
95% CI was 0.11% in the per protocol population.  
The Insuman non-comparative continuation phase of the HUBIN trial showed that the HbA1c values 
remained stable for 14 refill cycles, although these were higher than in the comparative phase. 
In randomized study MIP 310, treatment with intraperitoneal insulin was compared to subcutaneous 
treatment during 1 year. The 52 patients in the intraperitoneal group were using Insuplant for the first 
6 months and Insuman for the last 6 months. Study MIP 310 suggests that intraperitoneal insulin 
administration using the MiniMed pump and Insuman/Insuplant can be used for the treatment of 
diabetes type 1. After treatment with intraperitoneal Insuplant for 6 months, in the as treated dataset 
HbA1c was 0.32% lower compared to subcutaneous insulin (95% CI 0.662 to 0.018). After treatment 
with intraperitoneal Insuman, HbA1c was 0.410% lower compared to subcutaneous insulin (95% CI -
0.786 to -0.034). The design of study MIP 310 did not permit a good differentiation between the 
effects of Insuplant and Insuman as administration of these insulins was not randomized in sequence 
or double blind.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Insuplant has only been approved in France. Therefore, although the Hubin trial may have 
demonstrated non-inferiority of Insuman in comparison to Insuplant, this does not necessarily result in 
a positive benefit-risk ratio.   
In clinical practice, intraperitoneal insulin administration is a last resort in patients unresponsive to SC 
insulin treatment (demonstrated resistance to SC treatment, problematic absorption profile of SC 
insulin and as a consequence problematic fluctuations in glycaemia). The marketing authorisation 
should be limited to this restricted type 1 diabetic population. It is important to note that not all 
patients in Study 310 belonged to the target population. The inclusion criteria of study MIP 310 allowed 
T1DM patients to start this rather invasive therapy when they are insufficiently controlled after only 
three months of intensive insulin treatment.  
The HUBIN study is a trial that contains a non-inferiority comparative phase comparing Insuman and 
Insuplant. The comparative phase was single blind as a double blind was not technically feasible due to 
the short timelines. The inclusion criteria (HbA1c ≤ 9% and percentage error at refill equal or below 
20%) introduced bias in the HUBIN trial. 
In the comparative phase of the HUBIN study, non-inferiority was reached between Insuman and 
Insuplant for the refill accuracy. The refill accuracy error percentage did not substantially change in the 
Insuman non-comparative phase. However, the error percentages were higher than in the Insuman 
comparative phase, possibly due to a selection bias related with the inclusion criteria of the 
comparative phase. Moreover, refill accuracy is overestimated due to the exclusion of all patients with 
inconsistent refill accuracy values. 
In study 310, the non-inferiority margin of 0.5% is considered too wide. A difference of 0.5% in HbA1c 
is not clinically irrelevant. A margin of 0.3% or 0.4% would have been more acceptable. Nevertheless, 
HbA1c was lower in the IP group, so the difference is in favour of IP treatment. However, 11/52 
patients needed rescue insulin treatment in the IP group for an average of 24 days. These patients 
could be considered treatment failures. In addition, patients in the IP group completed more blood 
glucose tests compared to the subcutaneous group. This may have decreased the HbA1c values in the 
IP group in comparison to the SC group. A further efficacy analysis has been performed in relation to 
those patients using non-study insulin (“insulin analysis”). This analysis showed superiority for the IP 
treatment in the device analysis; non-inferiority was not shown for the insulin analysis. Therefore 
superiority cannot be claimed. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The number of patients in the studies is limited, due to the small number of patients in the target 
population. 
It is clear that an intraperitoneal pump needs to be implanted and regular interventions are necessary 
for refill and flushing. A high number of patients treated with Insuman Implantable in the HUBIN study, 
44.6%, needed at least one device intervention on an average exposure of 388 days per patient. Any 
problem with the device may have serious consequences. In addition, device interventions are a 
burden for patients. These device interventions can only be performed in a few specialized centres in 
Europe. 
In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial there was a high number of device events. 
Possibly related TEAEs were mainly related to the pump: medical device change, implantation or 
Insuman X-91 
Assessment report  
EMA/565846/2013 
Page 73/79 
 
 
removal in 10.8% and administration site disorders in 9.8%, half of these were device occlusions. 
Other possibly related TEAEs were metabolism and nutrition disorders (8.6%) and infections in 1.7%, 
for 6 of these 7 patients this was device or implant site related. 
During the treatment period in MIP 310, there were more serious adverse events in the CIPII group 
(12 SAEs in 9 patients) than the SC group (9 SAEs in 7 patients). In study 310, the incidence of severe 
hypoglycaemia was not different between the IP group and the SC group. The incidence of 
hypoglycaemia other than severe is also an important parameter which should be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia was not explicitly defined in the study protocol. Nevertheless, in the study phase of MIP 
310, there were 25 events of hypoglycaemia; 23 in the CIPII group and 2 in the SC group.  
There were no clinically relevant differences in device interventions and infections between Insuman 
and Insuplant. There were no clinically relevant differences in antibodies between Insuman and 
Insuplant. 
In rats and humans, it has been demonstrated that high local insulin levels may induce a focal 
reversible hepatic steatosis. Insulin can have a role in the stimulation of fat synthesis and steatosis. 
(Regnell & Lernmark, 2011).  The long term effects of IP insulin on the liver are unknown. In the 
HUBIN and MIP 310 study, hepatic steatosis was reported in one patient. No AE were observed during 
the study in this patient. Laboratory measurements demonstrated no differences in liver enzymes 
between IP insulin and SC insulin. 
In the Insuplant non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial, one patient died due to a malignant lung 
neoplasm with liver and bone metastases. In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial, 2 
patients (0.5%) died due to severe cardiac disorders for one and a cerebrovascular accident for the 
other. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the comparative part of the HUBIN trial, there were more adverse events with Insuman than with 
Insuplant (56.0 vs. 48.8%). In addition, more patients had adverse events possibly related to the 
insulin and/or to the pump during treatment with Insuman compared to Insuplant (12 patients 
(14.3%) vs. 7 patients (8.3%)). These findings suggest that Insuman may have some disadvantages 
in comparison to Insuplant. 
In the comparative part of the HUBIN study, the System Organ Class most often affected by possibly 
related TEAEs was metabolism and nutrition disorders (8.3 % [7/84] with Insuman and 4.8% [4/84] 
with Insuplant), which included glucose abnormalities. Annual incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 
0.451 episodes per patient-year with Insuman Implantable versus 0.343 episodes per patient-year 
with Insuplant. In the pharmacokinetic study, Cmax and AUC0-4h of Insuman Implantable seemed to 
be higher compared to Insuplant with respectively 70% and 40%. Also in the non-comparative arms 
the number of severe hypoglycaemia was higher with Insuman Implantable than with Insuplant (0.218 
per patient-year versus 0.140 per patient-year). Although the numbers were small and the differences 
were not statistically significant, Insuman may be associated with a higher risk for hypoglycaemia. 
Compared to the Insuplant non-comparative phase, the number of hyperglycaemic events per patient-
year was higher during the Insuman non-comparative phase (9.276 versus 8.272) as well as the 
number of hyperglycaemic events with ketonemia per patient-year (0.952 versus 0.187). 
Given the larger amount of insulin that is needed in obese patients, a subset analyses according to BMI 
is important with respect to efficacy and safety.  This analysis revealed that efficacy and safety were 
comparable for the different categories. No differences between weight classes were observed for refill 
accuracy.

In MIP 310, there was an increase in the urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio with intraperitoneal 
insulin treatment compared to SC treatment. The clinical significance is unclear, but harmful effects in 
the long term should be excluded. There also was an increase in the number of anti-insulin antibodies 
with intraperitoneal insulin treatment compared to subcutaneous insulin. The clinical significance is 
unclear, but there may be harmful effects in the long term. Of note, in the Hubin study there were no 
differences between Insuman and Insuplant with respect to anti-insulin antibodies. The urinary 
microalbumin/creatinine ratio was not measured in this study.  The Applicant will collect the 
microalbumin/creatinine ratio from the sites when available per standard of care. Those data will be 
collected in the registry study. 
Study MIP 310 was carried out between 2002 and 2004 and the procedure of continuous 
intraperitoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) has undergone further developments with changes in pump 
handling that could affect both the benefit and the risk of procedure of continuous intraperitoneal 
insulin infusion (CIPII). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The HUBIN study demonstrates that with respect to HbA1c, both Insuplant and Insuman can be used 
for the treatment of diabetes type 1 in patients undergoing continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion 
(CIPII). In the comparative phase of this study, Insuman and Insuplant were non-inferior with respect 
to HbA1c and refill accuracy. However, refill accuracy is overestimated due to the exclusion of all 
patients with a bad refill accuracy (38 of the 169 patients). In order to make a benefit risk assessment, 
a realistic estimate of the refill accuracy should be taken into account. 
There was a higher risk for hypoglycaemia and treatment related adverse events metabolism and 
nutrition disorders with Insuman compared to Insuplant in the HUBIN comparative phase. Also in the 
non-comparative arms the number of severe hypoglycaemia was higher with Insuman Implantable 
than with Insuplant (0.218 per patient-year versus 0.140 per patient-year). Given the results of the 
pharmacokinetic study, it may be that Insuman is associated with a higher risk for hypoglycaemia. 
Compared to the Insuplant non-comparative phase, the number of hyperglycaemic events per patient-
year was higher during the Insuman non-comparative phase (9.276 versus 8.272) as well as the 
number of hyperglycaemic events with ketonemia per patient-year (0.952 versus 0.187). 
Given the larger amount of insulin that is needed in obese patients, a subset analysis according to BMI 
was performed. Efficacy (HbA1c) and safety were similar in each category. No differences between 
weight classes were observed for refill accuracy. 
Insuplant so far has only been approved in France and is not manufactured anymore; the benefit/risk 
of Insuman should therefore be assessed within the context of its intraperitoneal administration. IP 
insulin administration has only been used in a small group of patients in a few centres in France and 
Holland. Currently in Europe, 404 patients are being treated with IP insulin using the MiniMed pump. In 
study MIP 310, HbA1c after treatment with intraperitoneal Insuman was 0.41% lower than after 
treatment with subcutaneous insulin. However, this study was only in part performed in the target 
population.  The Applicant has performed a post-hoc analysis in a sub-group of patients with use of 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), HbA1c >7.5%, mean SMPG value >180 mg/dL. It can 
be debated whether this is the real EVADIAC group; however, in any case these are patients with 
insufficient glycaemic control. The effect on HbA1c with IP treatment was superior to that with SC 
treatment.

Many patients needed rescue insulin during treatment. This is not very serious in clinical practice, but 
these patients could be considered treatment failures. In the MIP 310 study, patients in the IP group 
completed more blood glucose tests compared to the subcutaneous group. Due to these issues, 
superiority cannot be claimed. In the Insuman non-comparative phase of the HUBIN trial, 39.1% of the 
ITT population used subcutaneous insulin, in 62% of these cases due to delivery system dysfunction. 
Several important disadvantages are obvious from this study. Surgical implantation is necessary. There 
is an increased risk of infections, and regular refills and flushes should be performed. Further 
disadvantages of the use of IP Insuman compared to SC insulin are the higher risk of serious adverse 
events and hypoglycaemia. Also an increased risk for anti-insulin antibodies and urinary 
microalbuminuria was observed. CIPII has been associated with hepatic steatosis in one patient. The 
clinical relevance of these findings is not clear, but these findings may be important, especially for 
long-term safety.  
In general, these disadvantages hamper its use in larger patient groups. Nowadays CIPII is mainly 
used in patients with so called "brittle diabetes" who fail to reach adequate glycaemic control while on 
intensive SC insulin therapy. The majority also failed CSII. Therefore, the approved indication is 
“treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus that cannot be controlled with subcutaneous 
insulin (including pump) therapy, presenting with frequent, otherwise unexplained severe hyper-and/or 
hypoglycaemia”.  
Although the design of study MIP 310 does not allow for a full comparison between intensive 
intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration of Insuman, this study does not show that the 
benefits of Insuman administered by CIPII outweigh the risks. However, this study was carried out 
between 2002 and 2004 and the number of pump dysfunction and pump explantations have decreased 
thereafter. Also in the Insuman treated patients in the HUBIN trial 44.6 % needed a device 
intervention during mean study period of 388±100 days.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
CIPII with Insuman is currently applied in a few centres in Europe. The safety and efficacy of Insuman 
Implantable administered by CIPII are fully established in the therapeutic population. Many device 
interventions were necessary (in 44.6% of the patients on Insuman in the HUBIN trial) and 
complications, in particular infections, occurred regularly with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The 
benefit/risk of CIPII is positive in a sufficiently restricted patient group. It should be a last resort in 
patients that cannot be controlled with subcutaneous insulin (including pump) therapy, presenting with 
frequent, otherwise unexplained severe hyper- and/or hypoglycaemia.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by concensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Insuman Implantable in the treatment of adult patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus that cannot be controlled with subcutaneous insulin (including pump) therapy, 
presenting with frequent, otherwise unexplained severe hyper and/or hypoglycaemia is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

1.  Introduction
On 10 January 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar 13, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Information on the development program
The MAH stated that A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety of a 20-valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants, B7471013 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study
The B7471013 study was the Phase 3 study in the paediatric population. The participants in the 
primary study population were administered either 20vPnC or 13vPnC in a 3-dose vaccination 
schedule. 13vPnC was a sterile liquid suspension formulation containing saccharides from 
pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated 
to CRM197 (a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin). The vaccine was formulated to contain 2.2 µg of 
each saccharide, except for 4.4 µg of 6B, per 0.5-mL dose. The vaccine contained 295 μg succinate 
buffer, 0.85% sodium chloride, 100 μg polysorbate 80, and 125 µg aluminum as aluminum phosphate, 
per 0.5-mL dose. The 13vPnC supply was considered representative of Prevanar 13, as it was 
manufactured according to the approved Prevnar 13 commercial drug product process using 
commercially released vaccine drug substances.
20vPnC and 13vPnC, supplied as syringes, were both white suspensions and have a matching 
appearance. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1 Introduction
The MAH submitted a final report for:
•
B7471013 - A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety of a 20-valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants
2.3.2 Clinical study
B7471013 - A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety of a 20-valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants. 
Description: 
The purpose of this trial was to provide key safety data in infants receiving a 4-dose vaccine series of 
20vPnC. The targeted enrollment age of the population for this study was infants ≥34 weeks of 
gestation who were ≥42 to 98 days of age, since the routinely recommended vaccination schedule for 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and other vaccines in infants starts at approximately 2 months of

age. The participants were administered either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of 
age.
Methods
Treatments
Participants received a single 0.5-mL dose of either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at each vaccination visit (Doses 
1, 2, 3, and 4 at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively) administered intramuscularly into the anterolateral 
thigh muscle of the left leg by a designated site staff member. Other routine Pediatric vaccines were 
permitted according to official local recommendations/regulations at any time throughout study 
participation. 
Objective and endpoints
Approximately  1500  infants  were  planned  to  be  enrolled.  Overall,  a  total  of  1511  participants  were 
randomized and 1447 (95.8%) completed all 3 infant doses. 1442 (95.4%) completed the follow-up visit 
after Dose 3, 1385 (91.7%) participants received all 4 doses, and 1357 (89.8%) completed all visits per 
protocol. 
Study objectives, estimands, and endpoints are provided in Table 1.

Study design/ Randomisation 
This  was  a  Phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind  study  with  a  2-arm  parallel  design. 
Approximately 1500 infants ≥42 to ≤98 days of age were randomized (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC or

13vPnC  at  2,  4,  and  6  months  of  age  (Doses  1  through  3)  and  12  to  15  months  of  age  (Dose  4). 
Participants  received  the  same  vaccine  (20vPnC  or  13vPnC)  for  all  4  doses.  The  targeted  age  of  the 
population for this study was selected as this is the routinely recommended age for initial vaccination 
with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and other vaccines in infants. 
The duration of this trial for each participant was approximately 16 to 19 months.
An overview of the study design is presented below.
Statistical Methods
The primary safety objective was evaluated by descriptive summary statistics for prompted local 
reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site), prompted systemic events (fever, 
decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability), AEs (including SAEs) and NDCMCs. 
AEs were categorized according to the MedDRA. Other exploratory safety objectives were evaluated by 
descriptive summary statistics for the same as the primary safety endpoints.   
Results
Recruitment
Overall, a total of 1511 participants were randomized, 1447 (95.8%) participants completed 
all 3 infant doses, 1442 (95.4%) completed the follow-up visit after Dose 3, 1385 (91.7%) 
participants received all 4 doses, and 1357 (89.8%) completed all visits per protocol (Table 3). 
Disposition of all randomized participants was similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups.   
Numbers analysed
Of the 150 (9.9%) participants that were withdrawn from the trial, the most common reasons were 
lost to follow-up (52 [3.4%] participants) and withdrawal by parent/legal guardian (51 [3.4%].

participants). For participants who were withdrawn because they no longer met eligibility criteria, the 
majority were because they relocated out of the area.   
The numbers and percentages of participants included in the safety populations are summarized in 
Table 3. All participants who received at least 1 dose of 20vPnC or 13vPnC with safety follow-up after 
any dose were analysed in the safety population. 
Baseline data
Demographic and baseline characteristics of sex, race, ethnicity, and age for the safety population 
were similar in the participants in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups (Table 4). The majority of the study 
population was White (87.4%) and non-Hispanic/non-Latino (61.5%).

Safety results

Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction in both groups. Most local reactions 
were mild or moderate in severity and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 2 
days.

Irritability was reported most frequently in both groups. Most systemic events were mild or 
moderate in severity and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 2 days. The 
percentage of participants with any fever were similar in both groups (9.3%–18.0% in the 20vPnC 
group and 9.8%–17.0% in the 13vPnC group). Fever of >38.9°C was reported infrequently.

From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, at least 1 AE was reported in 29.6% of participants in the 
20vPnC group and 27.6% of participants in the 13vPnC group, and from Dose 4 to 1 month after 
Dose 4, AEs were reported in 15.1% of participants in the 20vPnC group and 15.8 % of 
participants in the 13vPnC group. No safety concerns were identified.

The percentages of participants with SAEs from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 4 were low and 
similar in the 20vPnC (4.4%) and 13vPnC (5.6%) groups. Most SAEs reported were consistent with 
medical events or conditions that may occur in this population, and all were assessed by the 
investigator as not related to study intervention.

The percentages of participants with NDCMCs from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 4 were low 
(≤2.8%) and similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, and consistent with medical conditions 
that may occur in these populations.


The percentages of participants with local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were generally 
similar after 20vPnC or 13vPnC across each of the subgroups of sex, race, and country/region.
The percentages of late preterm participants (infants born at ≥34 to <37 weeks of gestational age, 
N=111) with local reactions, systemic events, and overall AEs reported after 20vPnC or 13vPnC 
were generally similar between vaccine groups and to infants born full term.
Local reactions
The percentages of participants with local reactions at the injection site within 7 days after Doses 1 
through 4 of 20vPnC or 13vPnC are presented in Table 7. The percentages of participants with any 
local reactions after Doses 1 through 4 were generally similar in the 20vPnC group (51.6%, 45.8%, 
38.6%, and 40.6%, respectively) and 13vPnC group (53.6%, 49.1%, 40.0%, and 42.3%, 
respectively). The most frequently reported local reaction after any dose was pain at injection site 
(24.7%–40.5% in the 20vPnC group and 26.8%–42.0% in the 13vPnC group). Most local reactions 
were mild or moderate in severity. There was no strong trend in frequency or severity of local 
reactions across all 4 doses. Across Doses 1 through 4, the median day of onset for local reactions was 
between Day 1 and Day 2 (Day 1 was the day of vaccination) and local reactions resolved with a 
median duration between 1 to 2 days.

Systemic Events
The percentages of participants with systemic events within 7 days after Doses 1 through 4 were 
generally similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, and the most frequently reported systemic event 
was irritability (54.8 % to 68.2% in the 20vPnC group and 54.7% to 68.5% in the 13vPnC group), 
followed by drowsiness (35.3% to 64.8% in the 20vPnC group and 35.9% to 62.2% in the 13vPnC 
group). Both irritability and drowsiness frequencies decreased in both groups between Dose 1 and 
Dose 3, and Dose 4 frequencies for both events were similar to Dose 3. Most systemic events were 
mild or moderate in severity. The percentages of participants with any fever of ≥38.0°C were similar in 
the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups (9.3%–18.0% in the 20vPnC group and 9.8%–17.0% in the 13vPnC 
group). Fever of >38.9°C was reported infrequently in both groups (≤3.8% and ≤3.3 % in the 20vPnC 
and 13vPnC groups, respectively), and fever >40°C was reported only at Dose 4 (1 participant in each 
vaccine group). There was no strong trend in frequency or severity of fever across the 4 doses.

Adverse events
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, at least 1 AE was reported in 29.6% of participants in the 
20vPnC group and 27.6% of participants in the 13vPnC group. As commonly seen in this population, 
AEs in the SOC of infections and infestations were reported most frequently in the 20vPnC (18.2%) 
and 13vPnC (15.9%) groups and included upper respiratory tract infection (4.1% and 3.0%, 
respectively) and nasopharyngitis (2.8% and 1.2%, respectively). From Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 
4, AEs were reported in 15.1% of participants in the 20vPnC group and 15.8 % of participants in the in 
the 13vPnC group. As with the AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs in the SOC infections and 
infestations were reported most frequently in participants in the 20vPnC (11.6%) and 13vPnC (13.4 
%) groups and included upper respiratory tract infection (2.1% and 3.0%, respectively) and 
nasopharyngitis (2.3% and 1.1%, respectively). 
Related adverse events: The frequencies of any reported related AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after 
Dose 3 (≤0.4% and ≤1.0%) and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 (≤0.2% and ≤0.2%) were low 
and  similar  in  the  20vPnC  and  13vPnC  groups.  The  most  frequently  reported  related  AEs  were  in  the 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions and Gastrointestinal Disorders SOCs. 
Immediate Adverse Events:  Immediate AEs were reported infrequently in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
groups (≤0.4% of participants after each dose; the same AE was not reported more than once per dose). 
Most  immediate  AEs  belonged  to  the  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  SOC,  and 
none of the immediate AEs represented serious allergic reactions to 20vPnC. 
Severe Adverse Events Severe AEs were reported infrequently in both groups from Dose 1 to 1 month 
after Dose 3 (≤1.0%) and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 (≤0.7%), and the percentages were 
similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups. No severe AEs were assessed by the investigators as related 
to study intervention. The severe AEs most often represented SAEs consistent with diseases and medical 
conditions that may occur in the baseline infant and toddler population. 
Newly Diagnosed Chronic Medical Conditions The percentages of participants with newly diagnosed 
chronic medical conditions (NDMCMCs) after Dose 1 were low (2.8%) in both the 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
groups. From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 of 20vPnC or 13vPnC, NDCMCs were reported for 2.0% of

participants and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC or 13vPnC, for ≤0.4% of participants. 
The majority of NDMCs were new diagnoses of atopic dermatitis, eczema, or food and milk allergy. 
Deaths: There were no deaths during the trial. 
2.3.3 Discussion on clinical aspects
In the current study “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety of a 20-valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants”, the purpose was to evaluate the safety of 20vPnC 
in infants. 20vPnC was compared with 13vPnC, where 13vPnC was included as a control group. Safety 
results from this study are consistent with the known profile of 13vPnC as reflected in the EU SmPC and 
support the continued use of 13vPnC. No changes are being proposed to the Prevenar 13 label in this 
submission. The study confirms what is already known about the safety profile of Prevenar 13 and the 
submitted study does not change the benefit-risk balance for Prevenar 13.
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation
  Fulfilled:
No regulatory action required.

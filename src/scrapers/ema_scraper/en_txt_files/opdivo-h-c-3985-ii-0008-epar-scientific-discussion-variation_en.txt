2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Opdivo (nivolumab) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to 
the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). The PD-1 
receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T cell 
immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen 
presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in 
inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab potentiates T cell responses, including 
anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. 
Opdivo was granted EU approval through an accelerated assessment procedure on 19-Jun-2015 for the 
treatment, as monotherapy, of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adult. In parallel, 
nivolumab was granted EU approval on 20-Jul-2015, under the brand name of Nivolumab BMS, for the 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic SQ NSCLC after prior chemotherapy in adults. On 28 October 
2015, the indication in treatment of locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy in adults was added to Opdivo MA and Nivolumab BMS MA was 
subsequently withdrawn. 
Problem statement  
Kidney cancer accounts for approximately 2%-5% of all cancers worldwide1,2,3. Rates of kidney cancer are 
highest in Europe, North America, and Australia and lowest in India, Japan, Africa, and China4,5. 
The incidence of RCC varies widely among European countries, with the highest incidence rates reported for 
the Czech Republic, with up to 15.3 cases per 100,000 among males4. Although RCC incidence rates range 
widely among individual regions, the incidence rate for men is consistently approximately twice as much as 
that observed for women across all regions examined4. 
Prognosis of advanced RCC is poor.  Approximately 30% of patients with RCC have metastatic disease at the 
time of diagnosis. For patients initially diagnosed with locally advanced RCC, 40% ultimately develop 
metastatic disease. .  There are several distinct histological subtypes of RCC, including clear cell (reported in 
approximately 80% of patients), papillary, chromophobe, translocation, and collecting duct tumors.

Important established risk factors that are commonly associated with the development of RCC include 
smoking and obesity. Patients with a history of smoking were reported to have an increased risk for RCC 
compared to those with a never-smoker history (RR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.27 1.50), with a dose-dependent 
increase in risk associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.  Excess body weight has also been 
associated with increased risk for RCC, with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI resulting in an RR of 1.24 (P < 
0.0001) in men and 1.34 (P < 0.0001) in women. 
The scientific literature has shown that HIFα signalling is involved in the pathogenesis of clear-cell RCC. The 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling has been identified as an important target pathway because constitutive 
activation of the upstream signalling pathway leads to HIFα upregulation and activation.  Constitutive HIFα 
activation has been demonstrated to lead to the upregulation and activation of several proteins including 
VEGF, which is involved in tumor proliferation and neovasculature formation. Until 2005, the cytokines IL-2 
and IFNα were the only active treatment for advanced RCC. Since 2005, targeted agents have been 
approved for the treatment of RCC that will specifically act at the level of VEGF and mTOR signalling 
pathways. Agents that target angiogenesis include VEGFr TKI (eg, sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and 
axitinib) and VEGF binding monoclonal antibodies (eg, bevacizumab), while agents that target the mTOR 
pathway include the mTOR inhibitors (eg, everolimus and temsirolimus). 
Everolimus and axitinib are considered the two standard therapies for use after first-line TKI therapy in 
advanced RCC by ESMO clinical practice guidelines.  In addition, everolimus and axitinib are the only two 
targeted therapies with a category 1 recommendation in the NCCN guidelines for use in advanced RCC after 
first-line TKI therapy. 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication to add treatment as monotherapy of patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after prior therapy in adults, based on Study CA209025; a phase 3 study of 
nivolumab vs. everolimus in subjects with advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior 
anti-angiogenic therapy, and the CA209010 addendum study report; phase 2 dose-ranging study of 
nivolumab in subjects with progressive advanced/metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior 
anti-angiogenic therapy. 
The proposed and recommended indication for nivolumab for RCC is as follows: 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after 
prior therapy in adults. 
The recommended dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy for RCC is the same as the approved dose 
of 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes Q2W for melanoma and SQ NSCLC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to 
the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is exempt from preparation of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the 
environment

2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is 
considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nivolumab’s clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK), 
drug-drug interaction potential, QT prolongation potential, and dose selection for phase 2/3 studies was well 
characterized at the time of the initial marketing authorization. 
The nivolumab PPK model was updated to assess the potential effects of tumor type and immunogenicity on 
nivolumab PK in subjects with advanced RCC. The E-R relationship for efficacy was assessed in subjects with 
advanced RCC from studies CA209025 (a global, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study of nivolumab 
monotherapy vs everolimus for advanced or metastatic RCC) and CA209010 (a randomized, blinded, phase 
2 dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with progressive advanced/metastatic RCC who have 
received anti-angiogenic therapy) and the E-R safety relationship was assessed in subjects from Study 
CA209025. Additionally, an integrated immunogenicity analysis across the solid tumor patient population 
was performed to assess the incidence and effect of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics and safety of 
nivolumab. 
Population PK analyses 
The initial PPK analysis was performed using data from three Phase 1 studies (MDX1106-01, MDX1106-03 
and ONO-4538-01 [CA209005]), three Phase 2 studies (CA209010, ONO-4538-02, and CA209063) and 
three Phase 3 studies (CA209017, CA209057, and CA209025), with a total of 1484 subjects included. 
Studies CA209010 and CA209025 allowed for the assessment of nivolumab PK in subjects with advanced 
RCC. Bio-analytical methods used for quantifying nivolumab serum concentrations across the development 
program were cross-validated, thereby allowed merging of the exposure data for PPK analysis. 
The PPK model was developed using a previously developed final model and included the effect of tumor type 
(RCC, NSCLC, or other), immunogenicity, and albumin on CL and VC. The final model was a 2-compartment 
model with zero-order IV infusion input and first-order elimination with a proportional residual error model. 
The final PPK model included effects of baseline WT, eGFR, and ECOG on CL and baseline WT, sex, and 
NSCLC histology (using the combined SQ and NSQ groups) on VC. 
Parameter estimates from the final PPK model are provided in table 1.

Immunogenicity of Nivolumab 
Immunogenicity Analysis 
During the clinical development of nivolumab, three assays were used to detect the presence of nivolumab 
ADA. The primary study in this submission, Study CA209025, and all of the studies included in the integrated 
summary of immunogenicity used assay ICDIM 140 V1.00/V2.02 for immunogenicity analysis.  
Immunogenicity Results from Study CA209025 
A summary of the ADA assessments for nivolumab subjects on Study CA209025 who had evaluable ADA 
data at baseline and on treatment is presented in the table below. 
Table 4: Summary of anti drug antibody assessments in study CA209025, based on 16-week definition for 
persistent positive-all nivolumab treated subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. 
There were 27 (7.3%) subjects who were ADA positive, of which 1 (0.3%) subject was considered persistent 
positive and no subjects were neutralizing ADA positive. The highest titer value observed in ADA positive 
subjects was 256, which occurred in only one subject. This subject had only one ADA positive sample 
observed at 2 weeks after initiation of nivolumab dosing and no other ADA positive samples (Other 
category). All other ADA positive subjects had titer values less than 16. 
A total of 26 nivolumab treated subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category events and 
all were ADA negative. Thus, the presence of ADA was not associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity 
and/or infusion-related reactions. Overall, it does not appear that immunogenicity had an effect on the 
safety of nivolumab in Study CA209025. A pooled analysis of nivolumab ADA assessments with data 
available from several BMS-sponsored studies in which ADA was assessed by a sensitive and drug tolerant 
assay showed similar results. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
The exposure-response relationship was characterized for nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) and OS using 596 
previously treated subjects with advanced RCC from studies CA209025 and CA209010, who had exposure 
data available. The relationship between the nivolumab exposure and OS was characterized using a CPH 
model that incorporated the effects of covariates that may modulate the E-R relationship. The estimated 
effects of all of the predictor variables (Cavgss, CL, and covariates) on the hazard ratio of OS in the full 
model are presented in figure 2. Nivolumab Cavgss was not a significant predictor of hazard of death (95% 
CI of effect included 1) in the full model after accounting for nivolumab CL.

Exposure-Response Analysis for Safety in RCC 
The E-R relationship for safety was characterized for nivolumab exposure and AE-DC/D in 402 previously 
treated subjects with RCC in studies CA209025 and CA209010. The relationship between nivolumab 
exposure (Cavgss) and time to AE-DC/D was described by a semiparametric CPH model, and included 
assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on the E-R relationship. The covariate variables 
investigated in the E-R analysis of AE-DC/D included age, baseline body weight, sex, number of prior 
anti-angiogenic therapies, and baseline performance status (Karnofsky scale). 
Figure 3 presents the estimated effects of all of the predictor variables on the hazard of AEDC/ D in the Full 
Model.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PPK analysis included in this submission has shown that nivolumab volume of distribution was similar 
across tumor types (data not shown).  
Overall, immunogenicity was not considered clinically meaningful based on low ADA titers, low persistent 
positive rates, low incidence of neutralizing antibodies, and minimal impact on nivolumab clearance, with no 
evidence of altered safety profile and no evidence of loss of activity with neutralizing antibodies.  
The results of the analysis demonstrated that Cavgss was not a significant predictor of hazard of death after 
accounting for nivolumab CL. 
The risk of AE-DC/D, appeared to increase with decreasing Cavgss, but this may be due to confounding with 
variables not included in the analysis.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacology data are overall in line with previous observed data in NSCLC and melanoma patients. No 
relevant differences have been observed.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
CA209010 was a randomised, double-blind, 3-arm dose-ranging, Phase 2 study of nivolumab (0.3, 2, or 10 
mg/kg) in adult (aged ≥18 years) subjects with advanced RCC with a clear-cell component who had received 
prior treatment with at least 1 anti-angiogenic therapy in the advanced setting. Subjects were randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups (0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg) and received nivolumab as an IV infusion 
over 60 minutes Q3 wks.  
CA209010 was designed to investigate the dose-response relationship in the nivolumab treatment groups. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationship in the 0.3, 2, and 10 
mg/kg nivolumab groups as measured by PFS. Secondary objectives included the estimation of PFS, ORR, 
OS, and the rate of adverse events (AEs) in each nivolumab treatment group. 
Subjects were evaluated for response according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the 
first 12 months from randomisation and then every 12 weeks (± 1 week) until progressive disease (PD) was 
documented. 
The data reported was based on a cutoff date of 15-May-2013. The database lock point for this final analysis 
occurred on 02-Jul-2013. At the time of this final CSR, the analysis of PFS was completed and evaluation of 
OS was ongoing. The median number of doses subjects received during the treatment period was 6.0, 7.5, 
and  8.0  in  the  0.3,  2,  and  10  mg/kg  treatment  groups,  respectively.  A  CSR  addendum  (database  lock 
12-Mar-2015) was completed to update the results of PFS, DOR, OS, and safety. 
Results 
Of the 168 randomized subjects, 167 were treated with nivolumab (59, 54, and 54 subjects in the 0.3, 2, and 
10 mg/kg groups, respectively). One subject randomized to the 0.3 mg/kg group was not treated because 
the subject no longer met study criteria. 
•  Median age was 61.0 years, with 6.5% aged 75 years or older. Most subjects were white (93.5%) 
and male (72.0%). 
•  33.0%, 42.0%, and 25.0% of randomized subjects in the favorable, intermediate, and poor-risk 
MSKCC prognostic categories, respectively (IVRS source). 
• 
• 
The median duration of time from initial diagnosis to randomization was 4 years. 
The most common tumor sites reported were visceral/lung (74% overall) and lymph nodes (58% 
overall). 
•  Most subjects had a baseline KPS of 80 to 100 (87.5%). 
•  Most subjects had a quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline (88.1%)  
PFS (primary endpoint) 
In  the  CA209010  Addendum,  the  PFS  was  similar  across  treatment  groups  (Table  5  and  Figure  4)  and 
consistent with results reported in the CA209010 Final CSR. Median PFS was reached for each treatment 
group  (2.7,  4.0,  and  4.2  months  in  the  0.3,  2,  and  10  mg/kg  treatment  groups,  respectively).  In  the 
CA209010  Final  CSR,  a  stratified  log-rank  trend  test  indicated  no  dose  relationship  for  PFS  and  was 
confirmed  by  estimated  HRs  with  80%  CI  including  1.  The  estimated  HRs  for  the  addendum  likewise 
indicated no difference in PFS between treatment groups.

OS (secondary endpoint) 
As of the cut-off date, median OS was reached for all three treatment groups in CA209010 (18.5, 25.5, and 
24.8  months  for  the  0.3,  2,  and  10  mg/kg  treatment  groups,  respectively).  Estimated  HRs  indicated  no 
statistically  significant  difference  in  OS  between  treatment  groups.  Updated  OS  (estimated  using  K-M 
methodology) for each treatment group was plotted along with the median and its 80% CI. At the time of the 
data cut-off, 113 (67%) of 168 randomized subjects had died. The K-M estimations of OS are shown in Table 
6 and Figure 5.

CR or PR was achieved in 12 out of 60 subjects, 12 out of 54 subjects, and 11 out of 54 subjects in the 0.3, 
2, and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively. Time to response ranged from approximately 1.2 to 10 months across 
treatment groups. The median DOR was achieved in the 2 and 10 mg/kg groups (21.6 and 22.3 months, 
respectively).

Dose reductions/Interruptions 
For nivolumab, no dose escalations or dose reductions were allowed. 
For everolimus, dose reductions and escalations were allowed as per the approved product label or as per 
standard practice in countries where everolimus is not approved for the treatment of advanced RCC. 
Dose delays  were permitted for nivolumab and everolimus for up to 6 weeks from the last dose. Delays 
longer than 6 weeks were allowed only in cases where a prolonged steroid taper was required to manage 
drug-related AEs, or in some cases, if the delay was due to a non-drug related cause. Prior to re-initiating 
treatment in a subject with a dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS Medical Monitor must have been 
consulted. Subjects were to be monitored continuously for AEs while on study. Treatment modifications (eg, 
dose delay) were to be based on specific laboratory and AE criteria. 
Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
The following medications were prohibited during the study: 
Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug-related AE). 
• 
•  Systemic corticosteroids > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent (except to treat a drug-related AE). 
•  Any  concurrent  antineoplastic  therapy  (ie,  chemotherapy,  hormonal  therapy,  immunotherapy, 
extensive radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment of cancer). 
Live vaccines. 
• 
•  Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or PgP inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers were to be 
avoided by all enrolled subjects. If subjects who received everolimus required moderate CYP3A4 
and/or PgP inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers during the course of study drug treatment, dose 
modifications should have occurred as outlined in the study protocol.

Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  calculated  in  order  to  compare  the  OS  between  subjects  randomized  to  receive 
nivolumab and subjects randomized to receive everolimus. Approximately 569 events (ie, deaths) with an 
interim analysis after 398 events (70% of total OS events needed for final analysis) provides 90% power to 
detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.76 with an overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided). 
The HR of 0.76 corresponds to a 32% increase in the median OS, assuming a median OS of 14.8 months for 
everolimus and 19.5 months for nivolumab. The stopping boundaries at interim and final analyses were to be 
derived based on the number of deaths using O’Brien and Fleming α spending function. It was projected that 
an observed hazard ratio of 0.845 or less, which corresponds to a 2.7 months or greater improvement in 
median OS (14.8 mo vs 17.5 mo), would result in a statistically significant improvement in OS for nivolumab 
at the final OS analysis. The final analysis was planned to take place after 569 events (ie, deaths). 
Approximately 822 subjects were to be randomized to the two arms in a 1:1 ratio. Assuming a piecewise 
constant  accrual  rate  (with  a  maximum  rate  of  63  subjects/month  and  an  average  rate  of  41 
subjects/month), the accrual was expected to be approximately 20 months. The total duration of the study 
from start of randomization to final analysis of OS was expected to be 42 months (20 months of accrual + 
22 months of follow-up). The table below summarizes the expected timing of each analysis.  
Table 8: Schedule of analysis   
Randomisation 
An IVRS randomly assigned subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either nivolumab or everolimus, and stratified by the 
following  factors:  MSKCC  risk  group  (favorable-  vs.  intermediate-  vs  poor-risk);  number  of  prior 
anti-angiogenic therapy regimens in the advanced or metastatic setting (1 vs. 2) and region (US/Canada vs. 
Western Europe vs Rest of World). 
The randomization was carried out via permuted blocks within each stratum.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The  enrolment  period  lasted  approximately  18  months  (Oct-2012  to  Mar-2014).  The  last  subject  was 
randomized on 11-Mar-2014, and the last patient’s last visit date for this CSR occurred on 06-May-2015, 
providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 months. 
A total of 146 sites in 24 countries randomized subjects. Of the 821 randomized subjects, 346 (42.1%) were 
in the US and Canada, 281 (34.2%) were in Western Europe, and 194 (23.6%) were in the ‘rest of world’. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 18-Jun-2012. Eight country-specific amendments and six 
global amendments were issued for this study. 
There were 15 amendments to the protocol. Of them the amendment 12 and 15 were the most relevant. The 
former changed the order of the secondary objectives, indicating that ORR would be first after testing OS 
and then PFS. The amendment 15 modified the protocol to allow the crossover from everolimus to nivolumab 
(nivolumab extension phase) and defined the interim analysis as final analysis. 
Relevant protocol deviations were low in frequency (12 subjects [1.5%]) and similar between treatment 
groups: 7 subjects (1.7%) and 5 subjects (1.2%) in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively. The 
most common relevant protocol deviation was subjects receiving concurrent anti-cancer therapy while on

study treatment: 8 subjects (1.0%) (3 subjects [0.7%] in the nivolumab group and 5 subjects [1.2%] in the 
everolimus group).  
Baseline data 
A total of 821 subjects were randomized (1:1), 410 to nivolumab and 411 to everolimus. Most of the patients 
received treatment (406 and 397 patients, for nivolumab and everolimus, respectively). 
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was 62 years 
(range: 18-88) with 40% ≥65 years of age and 9% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were male 
(75%) and white (88%), all Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups were represented, 
and 34% and 66% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80% and 90 to 100%, respectively. The majority 
of patients (72%) were treated with one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The median duration of time from 
initial diagnosis to randomisation was 2.6 years in both the nivolumab and everolimus groups. The median 
duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0- 29.6+ months) in nivolumab-treated patients and was 3.7 
months (range: 6 days-25.7+ months) in everolimus-treated patients. 
Table 9: Demographic characteristics summary – all randomized subjects 
The MSKCC and Heng risk group breakdown was as expected for an advanced RCC population: 
•  49.2%  and  15.1%  of  subjects  were  in  the  intermediate  or  poor  MSKCC  risk  groups  at  baseline 
(IVRS), respectively. 
•  58.8% and 21.8% of subjects were in the intermediate or poor Heng risk groups at baseline (CRF), 
respectively. 
Between the 2 treatment groups, the most common site of disease was the lung (67.1%), followed by the 
lymph node (49.0%), and ‘other’ (36.2%) sites. 
Most  randomized  subjects  had  a  quantifiable  PD-L1  status  at  pre-study  (baseline)  (756/821,  [92.1%]). 
Subjects  were  enrolled  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression  level,  and  PDL1  expression  level  was  not  a 
stratification factor.

Medical History 
Abnormal physical examination findings were reported at baseline for 42.2% of subjects randomized to 
nivolumab and 40.6% of subjects randomized to everolimus. The most frequent body system (≥10% of 
subjects) with abnormal physical exam findings at baseline was skin (14.1%) and musculoskelatal (10.0%) 
in the nivolumab group and skin (11.7%) in the everolimus group. The most frequent (≥10% of subjects)

pre-treatment events were fatigue (19.3%) and cough (11.0%) in the nivolumab group and fatigue (16.3%) 
in the everolimus group. 
Previous and Subsequent Treatments 
The numbers and types of prior cancer therapies (per CRF) were balanced between treatment groups (see 
table below). The most frequent prior systemic cancer therapies in the metastatic setting (10% of subjects) 
in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively, were the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
sunitinib (60.0% and 58.9%), pazopanib (29.0% and 31.9%), and axitinib (12.4% and 12.2%). 
Table 11: Prior cancer therapy summary – all randomized subjects 
Subsequent  systemic  anti-cancer  therapy  was  received  by  67.3%  of  nivolumab  subjects  and  69.1%  of 
everolimus subjects (Table 12).

Outcomes and estimation 
Nivolumab  demonstrated  superior  OS  and  ORR  compared  with  everolimus.  Responses  to  nivolumab 
occurred early (median time to objective response: 3.52 months) and were durable. 
PFS  was  not  statistically  significant,  but  the  available  data  suggested  a  benefit  with  nivolumab  vs. 
everolimus (HR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.75, 1.03], stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.1135), with separation of the 
K-M curves after 6 months favouring nivolumab. 
Of 803 treated subjects, 179/406 (44.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 183/397 (46.1%) subjects 
in the everolimus group were treated beyond initial RECIST v1.1 progression. Of the 179 subjects in the 
nivolumab group treated beyond initial RECIST v1.1 progression, 51 experienced non-conventional benefit 
(ie, durable reductions and/or stabilization in the size of target lesions after initial progression).

OS (primary endpoint) 
Nivolumab  demonstrated  superior  OS  compared  with  everolimus  (HR:  0.73  [98.52%  CI:  0.57,  0.93]; 
stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.0018). 
Median OS was 25.00 months in the nivolumab group and 19.55 months in the everolimus group. OS rates 
were higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group at 6 months (89.2% vs 81.2%, respectively) 
and 12 months (76.0 % vs 66.7%, respectively). 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS separated early, favouring nivolumab.

Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier overall survival plot – all randomized subjects 
A total of 227 (55.4%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 196 (47.7%) subjects in the everolimus group 
were censored. At the time of this database lock point, a higher proportion of subjects in the nivolumab 
group vs the everolimus group were still on treatment (16.3% vs 6.8%), and a similar proportion were either 
in follow-up (36.6% vs 36.7%) or off study (2.4% vs 4.1%). 
Median  follow-up  for  OS  (time  between  randomization  and  death  or  last  known  date  alive)  was  18.25 
months (range: 0.0 to 30.7 months) in the nivolumab group and 17.22 months (range: 0.0 to 31.5 months) 
in the everolimus group. 
Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of subjects; 96.1% and 93.9% of randomized subjects in the 
nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively, either died or had a last known alive date on or after the last 
patient last visit date for the CSR of 06-May-2015. 
Results of 3 sensitivity analyses (unstratified analysis, analysis using stratification factors as determined at 
baseline [CRF source], and analysis of all treated subjects) were consistent with the primary OS analysis. 
In a multivariate analysis of OS, the treatment effect when adjusted for time from diagnosis to start of first 
systemic therapy in metastatic regimen (< 1 year), baseline ANC > ULN, and baseline platelets > ULN, was 
consistent  with  the  primary  OS  analysis  (HR:  0.73;  stratified  Cox  model  p-value  =  0.0030).  Time  from 
diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen, baseline ANC, and baseline platelets were 
significant prognostic variables for OS. 
PFS (secondary endpoint) 
While  not  statistically  significant,  PFS  data  suggested  a  benefit  with  nivolumab  vs  everolimus  (HR:  0.88 
[95%CI: 0.75 to 1.03], stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.1135), with separation of the K-M curves after 6 
months favouring nivolumab; see Table 14 and Figure 8.

The median PFS was 4.60 months in the nivolumab group and 4.44 months in the everolimus group. 
The 6-month PFS rate was 39% in both treatment groups and the 12-month PFS rate was 23% in the 
nivolumab group and 19% in the everolimus group. 
The K-M curves overlapped until approximately 6 months and then separated, favouring nivolumab 
beyond this time point and more pronounced over time when looking at the tail of the curve (Figure 
8). 
•  318 (77.6%) subjects had a PFS event in the nivolumab group (311 progression and 7 deaths) 
and 322 (78.3%) subjects had a PFS event in the everolimus group (312 progression and 10 
deaths); 
•  92 (22.4%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 89 (21.7%) subjects in the everolimus group 
were censored. Among the randomized subjects censored on the date of last on study tumor 
assessment (72 [17.6%] nivolumab and 55 [13.4%] everolimus), the most common reason for 
censoring was ‘still on treatment’ in the nivolumab group (47 [11.5%] subjects) and ‘received 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy’ in the everolimus group (28 [6.8%] subjects). 
Results of 3 sensitivity analyses of PFS (analysis using stratification factors as determined at baseline [CRF 
source],  analysis  accounting  for  assessment  after  subsequent  therapy,  and  analysis  accounting  for 
radiographic progression or death) were consistent with the primary PFS analysis.

ORR 
The investigator-assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 which was superior in the nivolumab group (103/410, 
25.1%) compared with the everolimus group (22/411, 5.4%), with a stratified CMH test p-value of < 0.0001 
(Table 15). 
•  BOR was CR in 4 subjects (1.0%) in the nivolumab group and 2 subjects (0.5%) in the everolimus 
group 
•  BOR was PR in 99 (24.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 20 (4.9%) subjects in the 
everolimus group. 
•  BOR was unable to be determined (UTD) in 23 (5.6%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 47 
(11.4%) subjects in the everolimus group (see Table 15 for all reasons for UTD). 
• 
• 
In both treatment groups, the main reason for BOR UTD was ‘death prior to disease 
assessment.’ 
For the 2 subjects in the everolimus group with ‘not reported’ as the reason for BOR UTD, the 
BOR was reported as ‘not evaluable’, with no specified reason provided. 
Reductions in target lesion tumor burden appeared to be deeper in the nivolumab group as compared to the 
everolimus group.

The ORR with a confirmatory scan after at least 4 weeks (ie, confirmed ORR) was superior in the nivolumab 
group (88/410, 21.5%) compared with the everolimus group (16/411, 3.9%), with a stratified CMH test 
p-value of < 0.0001. 
DOR 
Median TTR was 3.52 months in the nivolumab group and 3.70 months in the everolimus group (see table 
below). The majority of responses occurred within the first 4 months (77/103 [74.8%] for nivolumab and 
14/22 [63.6%] for everolimus). 
At the time of the database lock point, the proportion of responders with an ongoing response of PR or CR (as 
of the last tumor assessment before censoring) was 49/103 (47.6%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 
10/22 (45.5%) subjects in the everolimus group (Table 14, Table 16, and Figure 9). 
Median  DOR  was  11.99  months  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  the  nivolumab  group,  49  responders  were 
censored  (36  still  on  treatment,  9  in  follow-up,  and  4  received  subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy).  In  the 
everolimus group, 10 responders were censored (7 still on treatment, 1 in follow-up, 1 received subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy, and 1 withdrew consent). 
Among subjects with a BOR of SD, the median duration of SD was 5.59 months (95% CI: 5.36, 7.36) in the 
nivolumab group (25/141 [17.7%] subjects with ongoing SD) and 7.29 months (95% CI: 5.88, 7.75) in the 
everolimus group (47/227 [20.7%] subjects with ongoing SD).

Quality of life results 
Overall survival could be accompanied by an improvement over time in disease related symptoms and 
non-disease specific quality of life (QoL) as assessed using valid and reliable scales in the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) and the 
EuroQoL EQ-5D. Apparently, meaningful symptom improvement (MID=2 point change in FKSI-DRS score; 
p<0.001) and time to improvement (HR= 1.66 (1.33,2.08), p<0.001) were significantly better for patients 
on the nivolumab arm. While both arms of the study received active therapy, the QoL data should be 
interpreted in the context of the open-label study design and therefore cautiously taken. 
Nivolumab Subjects Treated Beyond RECIST v1.1-Defined Progression 
A total of 44.1% (179/406) of treated subjects in the nivolumab group and 46.1% (183/397) of subjects in 
the everolimus group were treated beyond progression (defined as a last dosing date after a RECIST v1.1 
progression date). 
Of the 179 subjects treated beyond progression in the nivolumab group, 51 were considered 
non-conventional benefiters, defined as subjects who had not experienced a BOR of PR/CR prior to initial 
RECIST v1.1-defined progression, and met at least 1 of the following criteria: 
Criterion 1: Appearance of a new lesion followed by decrease from baseline of at least 10% in the sum of the 
target lesions (15 subjects). 
Criterion 2: Initial increase from nadir ≥20% in the sum of the target lesions followed by reduction from 
baseline of at least 30% (5 subjects). 
Criterion 3: Initial increase from nadir ≥20% in the sum of the target lesions or appearance of new lesion 
followed by at least 2 tumor assessments showing no further progression defined as a 10% additional 
increase in sum of target lesions and new lesions (44 subjects).

Ancillary analyses 
Results according to PD-L1 expression 
Subjects  were  enrolled  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression.  PD-L1  tumor  membrane  expression  levels  were 
evaluated  using  a  novel  automated  IHC  assay  incorporating  a  rabbit-anti-human  PD-L1  antibody.  PD-L1 
expression was defined as the percentage of viable tumor cells demonstrating plasma membrane  PD-L1 
staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells per this validated Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. 
All  randomized  subjects  had  tumor  samples  available,  and  subjects  with  evaluable  pre-study  (baseline) 
tumor samples were tested for PD-L1 expression. The majority of samples (74.7%) were collected at the 
primary tumor site. 
Most subjects (92.1%) had a quantifiable PD-L1 level at pre-study (baseline), and the proportion of subjects 
with  quantifiable  PD-L1  expression  was  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups  (90.2%  nivolumab  and 
93.9% everolimus) (see table below). 
Table 17: Overall frequency of PD-L1 expression at pre-study (baseline) – all randomized subjects 
Efficacy results were generally consistent across PD-L1 expression levels (1%, 5%, or 10%), with the 
exception of the OS result in the small subgroup of subjects with ≥10% PD-L1 expression (n = 32 nivolumab 
and n= 30 everolimus). 
OS per PD-L1 expression 
Nivoumab  demonstrated  superior  OS  compared  with  everolimus  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of OS by PD-L1 expression at the 1% level are provided in Figure 10, with unstratified 
HRs and 95% CIs provided in Figure 11. 
• 
• 
In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%: 
o  Median OS (months) was 21.82 for nivolumab subjects compared to 18.79 for everolimus 
subjects. 
o  The OS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.17). 
In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression < 1%: 
o  Median OS (months) was 27.37 for nivolumab subjects compared to 21.22 for everolimus 
subjects. 
o  The OS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.97). 
There was longer median OS in subjects with < 1% PD-L1 expression relative to subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 
expression (Figure 10). 
• 
The OS HR for PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% vs <1% was 1.27 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.78) in the nivolumab 
group and 1.24 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.70) in the everolimus group.

PFS per PD-L1 expression 
Results  across  pre-study  (baseline)  PD-L1  expression  subgroups  were  similar  to  the  PFS  result  in  all 
randomized subjects.  
• 
In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression ≥1%: 
o  Median  PFS  was  5.36  months  for  nivolumab  subjects  compared  to  4.17  months  for 
everolimus subjects. 
o  The PFS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.12). 
• 
In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression < 1%: 
o  Median  PFS  was  3.94  months  for  nivolumab  subjects  compared  to  4.67  months  for 
everolimus subjects. 
o  The PFS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.07). 
Similar  to  the  K-M  curve  of  the  all  randomized  population  (Figure  8),  the  K-M  PFS  curves  for  PD-L1 
subgroups overlapped initially and then separated, favoring nivolumab, becoming more pronounced over 
time when looking at the tail of the curve. 
ORR per PD-L1 expression 
In the nivolumab group, objective responses were observed in subjects regardless of PD-L1 expression. In 
the everolimus group, no objective responses were observed in the ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and indeterminate/not 
evaluable PD-L1 expression subgroups. 
•  A  higher  ORR  was  observed  in  nivolumab-treated  vs  everolimus-treated  subjects  across  PD-L1 
expression subgroups. 
• 
In the nivolumab group, the ORR was higher for subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 expression (30.9%) than 
subjects  with  <  1%  PD-L1  expression  (22.8%)  (see  table  below).  At  a  cut-off  of  5%  for 
pre-treatment  tumour  PD-L1  expression,  nivolumab-treated  patients  with  ≥5%PD-L1  expression 
had  an  ORR  of  43%  (95%CI:  28.3-59.0),  compared  to  22%  (95%CI:  18.0-27.3)  for 
nivolumab-treated patients with <5% baseline PD-L1 expression.

OS per subgroups 
Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  using  an  unadjusted  univariate  Cox  model  to  assess  the  impact  of 
baseline MSKCC risk group, number of prior anti- angiogenic regimens in the advanced/metastatic setting; 
region, age category, gender, race, smoking status, Karnofsky performance status, prior cytokine in the 
advanced/metastatic setting, time from diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen, 
and Heng risk group. 
The OS unstratified HR favored nivolumab vs. everolimus for all pre-defined subgroups, with the exception 
of the ≥75 years and Asian subgroups (Figure 12 ). The CIs in these subgroups were wide and encompassed 
1.0 due to small subgroup sizes. 
The poor MSKCC risk subgroup and Karnofsky performance status < 90% subgroup showed the greatest OS 
benefit with nivolumab vs. everolimus.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with nivolumab 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours. 
Elderly patients  
Regarding elderly patients, a relatively large number of patients aged ≥65–<75 years of age was enrolled in 
the pivotal study, and superiority of nivolumab over everolimus was demonstrated in this population.  
A relatively small number of patients aged ≥75 years of age was enrolled, and in this population no clear 
benefit from treatment with nivolumab relative to everolimus could be established (HR: 1.23, 95%CI: 
0.66-2.31, for OS).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
CA209025 was a randomized, open-label study that included subjects with advanced RCC who had received 
prior therapy. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria recruited a population in second line of RCC (clear cell) according to the 
current clinical practice.  
However it should be noted that third line patients could be also included into the trial. As per current 
guidelines (NCCN version 3.2015 Kidney Cancer) cytoreductive nephrectomy (when possible) is 
recommended in stage IV disease. From the full list of inclusion criteria, it appears that patients that were 
not amenable to this procedure were also eligible for enrolment in the study. The results in terms of ORR and 
OS in this sub-group point out the better results for those treated with nivolumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 44/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to nivolumab or everolimus and stratified according to the following factors: 
region, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups and number of prior anti-angiogenic 
therapies. These stratification factors were considered acceptable. MSKCC or Heng’s model are widely used.  
The primary objective was to compare the OS of nivolumab vs everolimus. A single pre-planned interim OS 
analysis was to be conducted when at least 398 (70%) of the 569 required events for the final analysis had 
been reported. This formal comparison of OS allowed for early stopping and would become the final analysis 
if results were statistically significant (P ≤0.0148) and clinically meaningful. 
The secondary endpoints of investigator-assessed ORR and PFS (per RECIST v1.1) were tested hierarchically 
to preserve the experimental-wise type I error rate at 5%. The endpoints were considered acceptable. 
Given that OS was the primary endpoint, the open label design was considered acceptable. However, for 
determination of the secondary endpoints PFS and ORR, investigator-assessed RECIST measurements were 
used, and no use was made of independent review committee (IRC)-based RECIST measurement. This 
approach was chosen despite the advice to use IRC-based response evaluation, as previously recommended 
by the CHMP (scientific advice EMEA/H/SA/2253/2/2011/II). The use of investigator-assessed response 
determination was not considered adequate in view of the open-label nature of the study, and the 
consequent high risk of bias influencing determination of PFS. However, this uncertainty is no longer 
relevant given the magnitude of the effect in terms of OS observed in favour of nivolumab treatment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The baseline characteristics were evenly balanced between both arms. The majority of subjects were men 
and white (75% and 88% respectively) with only 9% > 75 years. The majority of the population included in 
the study were in the intermediate and poor MSKCC risk group. The disease characteristics and prior 
treatments are reflecting the current clinical practice. Almost 83% did not receive cytokine agents in 
previous treatments and the majority of patients received 1 prior anti-angiogenic therapy (76.0%) with 23% 
receiving two. 
Results from study CA209025 are based on a pre-defined interim analysis (clinical database lock of 
18-Jun-2015). This interim analysis, according to the protocol and SAP was to be conducted when at least 
398 (70%) of the 569 required events for the final analysis had been reported. The independent DMC 
reviewed the interim OS data on 17-Jul 2015. The DMC confirmed that the pre-specified boundary for 
significance was crossed (P < 0.0148) and noted that there were no new safety signals that would affect 
continuation of the study. The last subject was randomized on 11-Mar-2014, and the last patient’s last visit 
date occurred on 06 May 2015, providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 months (median of 
18.25 months for nivolumab and 17.22 months for everolimus). 
The analysis of the primary endpoint (OS) revealed a longer survival for patients treated with nivolumab vs 
everolimus (HR: 0.73 [98.52% CI: 0.57, 0.93]; stratified log-rank test p value = 0.0018). The median of OS 
for nivolumab group was 25 months, whereas subjects treated with everolimus achieved a median of OS of 
19.55 months. This gain in OS (5.45 months) is considered clinically meaningful. The survival rate at 1 year 
was higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (76.0% vs 66.7%). The profile of the 
Kaplan-Meier curves showed a clear separation.  
This result seems quite robust, since 3 different sensitivity analyses (unstratified analysis, analysis using 
stratification factors as determined at baseline [CRF source], and analysis of all treated subjects) 
demonstrated similar results (HR and 98.5% CI; 0.76 [0.59, 0.97], 0.70 [0.54, 0.90] and 0.72 [0.56, 0.93] 
respectively). In addition, the results obtained with the multivariate analysis (adjusted for time from 
diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen (< 1 year), baseline ANC > ULN, and 
baseline platelets > ULN) was also similar with the main analysis (HR: 0.73; stratified Cox model p-value = 
0.0030). 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 45/84 
 
  
  
 
 
Also, the low degree of censoring prior to ~15 months (the minimum follow-up for OS) in both treatment 
groups substantiate the maturity of the results. 
Subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 67.3% of nivolumab subjects and 69.1% of 
everolimus subjects. The most frequently treatments administered were axitinib (24.1% vs 36.3%) and 
pazopanib (9.0% and 15.6%) for nivolumab subjects and everolimus subjects respectively. Of note, 25.6% 
of patients previously treated with nivolumab received everolimus after progression, versus 5.6% of the 
patients in the everolimus arm. However, the OS benefit seen for patients treated with nivolumab in 
comparison to those treated with everolimus, does not seem to be largely influenced by the use of more or 
more effective post study treatment by patients treated with nivolumab. More patients in the everolimus 
arm had post study treatment and the kind of used post study treatments was (apart from anti PDL-1 
treatment in the everolimus arm) not different in the two study arms. 
The subgroups analysis are consistent with the main study results.  
Of note, in the sub-population of subjects (N= 46 and 52 in the nivolumab and everolimus treatment groups, 
respectively) without nephrectomy enrolled in study CA209025, patients on  nivolumab had substantially 
better survival benefit (mOS: 19.78 [11.3-24.61] vs 8.48 [4.73-13.40]; HR 0.56, p=0.0188) than patients 
on everolimus. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, there is a lack of difference in PFS between the two treatment arms. 
This is discordant with the large treatment effect observed on the primary endpoint OS. A potential 
explanation could be related to the delayed effect of nivolumab.  In previous studies with nivolumab it was 
observed that there is a delay in the effect of nivolumab, for example observed in melanoma patients with 
rapid disease progression (before 3 months of treatment) where the effect of nivolumab seems to be limited. 
However, in that case also a delay effect on OS was observed.  
Although, the discrepancy between the observed PFS and OS results are not yet completely explained, it is 
unlikely that the OS benefit seen for nivolumab in comparison to everolimus is caused by subsequent use of 
different post study treatments in the nivolumab arm. 
ORR was superior in the nivolumab group (25.1% vs 5.4%; 21.5% vs 3.9% with a confirmatory scan after 
at least 4 weeks) even though the medians of the duration of response were identical (11.99 months).  
A relatively large proportion of patients were treated beyond progression in both treatment arms: 44.1% 
(179/406) of treated patients in the nivolumab group and 46.1% (183/397) of patients in the everolimus 
group were treated beyond progression. Despite a similar proportion of the patients being treated beyond 
progression, there was a clear and large difference in the treatment duration, demonstrating that patients in 
the nivolumab arm were treated far longer beyond progression than patients in the everolimus arm.  
The analysis of PD-L1 expression did not offer any conclusive data, probably due to the sample size of each 
subgroup. Overall, no effect on the predictive value of PD-L1 was observed in both treatment arms.  
The biomarker analysis presented by the Applicant was not comprehensive, and additional analyses can be 
envisioned which may lead to improved understanding of predictive biomarkers in patients treated with 
nivolumab, including: determination of other biomarkers (including but not restricted to PD-L2, PD-L1, 
mismatch-repair status) and alternative methods for immunohistochemical scoring of PD-L1/PD-L2 (e.g. 
expression localisation [e.g. tumour center vs. invasive margin], tumour versus immune cell staining).   
The impact of different biomarkers on nivolumab treatment will still be further investigated for all approved 
indications including RCC, post approval. Further investigations on the potential role of PD-L1/2 expression, 
or any other biomarker, on the efficacy of nivolumab in RCC was considered needed, consistent with 
Assessment report

Page 46/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
previous requirements for already approved indications. The annex II conditions have been updated to 
include the exploration of biomarkers in the RCC indication.  
In the pivotal study, only patients pretreated with antiangiogenic therapy were enrolled. Some limited data 
in patients without prior antiangiogenic therapy (9 out of 34 subjects from a phase 1 clinical trial) support 
that  efficacy  appears  in  line  to  that  of  patients  pretreated  with  antiangiogenic  therapies,  but    given  the 
limited  data  available,  no  definitive  conclusions  regarding  the  efficacy  of  nivolumab  in  this  subgroup  of 
patients can be drawn. However, as nivolumab has a different mode of action than the anti-VEGF and mTOR 
inhibitor therapies currently indicated for RCC, it is probable to extrapolate the rational that nivolumab would  
be effective after another treatment other than antiangiogenic therapy. Hence, a restriction to only after 
prior anti-angiogenic therapy is not deemed adequate. It is noted that antiangiogenic therapies constitute 
the  current  standard  of  care  in  first  line,  therefore,  it  is  expected  that  patients  treated  without  prior 
antiangiogenic treatment in the clinical practice would be limited. However, physicians should be aware of 
the existing limitations and appropriate information has been included in Section 5.1.  
In addition, no patients with non-clear cell RCC have been treated with nivolumab, but in light of the unique 
mechanism  of  action  of  nivolumab  which  is  independent  of  any  specific  mutations  such  as  the  Von 
Hippel-Liday (VHL) mutation, restrictions based on histology subtype are not deemed appropriate. This is 
consistent with regulatory precedent, taking also into account the rarity of non-clear cell RCC.  Additional 
data  will  be  generated  in  this  subgroup  of  patients  from  an  ongoing  study  (study  CA209374)  at 
post-approval. The lack of clinical data for nivolumab in patients with non-clear cell RCC has been mentioned 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The treatment with nivolumab in patients with RCC previously treated has shown a longer survival than 
everolimus. This result was considered clinically meaningful. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (changes 
underlined): 
To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane 
level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and 
specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with 
measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be 
provided for all the approved indications: 
- Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066  
- RCC: studies CA209025 and CA209009 
To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression conducted in Study 
CA209066 and CA209025. 
Also, the CHMP recommended that the efficacy results, of study CA209374 (on-going), for the sub-group of 
patients with non-clear RCC should be submitted post approval.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The assessment of safety of nivolumab in the proposed indication is based on safety data from the pivotal 
phase 3 study CA209025 and supportive phase 2 study CA209010. 
There  are  no  across  study  integration  analyses  in  this  summary  of  clinical  safety.  The  rationale  for  not 
integrating is due to the large sample size in the primary controlled study (CA209025) using the proposed 
dosing regimen allows for robust characterization of safety, and second, the supportive study (CA209010) 
was a 3-arm dose-ranging study which evaluated different dosing from the proposed dosing regimen. 
Patient exposure 
Study CA209025 
An overview of the number of subjects enrolled, randomised, and treated in study CA209057 is presented in 
the table below. 
Table  20:  End  of  Treatment  Period  Subject  Status  Summary  -  All  Enrolled,  Randomized,  and  Treated 
Subjects- CA209025 
The last subject was randomized on 11-Mar-2014, and the last patient’s last visit date for this CSR occurred 
on 06-May-2015, providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 months. 
At  the  time  of  the  database  lock  for  this  CSR  (18-Jun-2015),  there  were  708  subjects  (88%)  who 
discontinued study therapy (339 subjects [83.5%] in the nivolumab group and 369 subjects [92.9%] in the 
everolimus group). The most common reason for discontinuation of study therapy between the 2 treatment 
groups was disease progression: 285 subjects (70.2%) and 273 subjects (68.8%) in the nivolumab and 
everolimus groups, respectively.  
Subjects were able to receive a higher dose of nivolumab than everolimus (82.0% vs 68.5% received ≥ 90% 
of the planned dose intensity), an observation consistent with the observed safety profile  of both agents, 
and  with  protocol-defined  dose  reductions  for  everolimus  toxicity  as  per  the  approved  product  labeling 
(Table 21).

Table 21: Cumulative Dose and Relative Dose Intensity Summary - All Treated Subjects - CA209025 
In CA209025, nivolumab was administered at 3 mg/kg monotherapy as an IV infusion every 2 weeks. The 
majority of nivolumab-treated subjects received the intended nivolumab dosing regimen on-study. 
The median duration of nivolumab treatment was 5.54 months (range: 0.0 to 29.6+ months) with a median 
of 12.0 doses received (range: 1 to 65 doses), which was higher than the median duration of everolimus 
treatment of 3.71 months (range: 0.2 to 25.7+ months) (Figure 15). 
Figure 15: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Duration of Study Therapy Subjects - 
A substantially higher proportion of subjects in the nivolumab group had a duration of therapy lasting > 6 
months  than  in  the  everolimus  group,  and  this  trend  persisted  for  duration  of  therapy  >  12  months. 
Accordingly, at the time of analysis, a greater number of subjects were continuing nivolumab treatment than 
everolimus treatment (67 vs 28 subjects).  
A  lower  frequency  of  discontinuation  for  study  drug  toxicity  regardless  of  causality  was  observed  in  the 
nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (8.6% vs. 13.4%, respectively). In addition, there 
were fewer subjects who requested to discontinue study treatment in the nivolumab group compared with 
the  everolimus  group  (1.2%  vs.  4.5%).  Nine  subjects  (2.2%)  in  the  nivolumab  group  and  14  subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 49/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
(3.5%) in the everolimus group discontinued study treatment due to AEs unrelated to study drug; none of 
these subjects had disease progression as an additional reason for discontinuation. No subject discontinued 
nivolumab in the treatment period for a reason listed as “other”. However, 4 subjects in the everolimus 
group discontinued treatment for a reason listed as “other”: one subjects  for PI discretion, other subject for 
CT report suggested radiological progression and investigator used this instead of RECIST to determine that 
patient had progressed and took them off trial treatment, in other subject the investigator has determined 
that the patient should receive radiotherapy for cutaneous metastasis and other required interruption of 
everolimus for greater than 6 weeks. 
Reasons  for  withdrawal  of  consent,  when  given,  were:  subject  refusal  to  continue  treatment,  study 
procedures  and  survival  follow-up  (nivolumab  group);  subject  admitted  on  oncological  network  and 
accessing on-market everolimus (everolimus group); subject decided to stop the medication and not accept 
follow-up  contact  (everolimus  group);  subject  refused  further  treatment  under  the  protocol  and  refused 
surveillance in the site (everolimus group); and subject will see doctor closer to home (everolimus group). 
A  total  of  5  subjects  (2  in  the  nivolumab  group  and  3  in  the  everolimus  group)  discontinued  the  study 
treatment for maximum clinical benefit. 
Dose Delay, Dose Reduction, Infusion Interruption, and Reduction of Infusion Rate 
Most subjects received all doses of study medication without an infusion interruption (96.6 in the nivolumab 
group), rate reduction, or delay (Table 22). Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab treatment. 
Dose Delays and Interruptions  
In  the  nivolumab  group,  51.0%  of  subjects  had  at  least  1  dose  delayed,  with  42.4%  of  subjects  in  the 
nivolumab group experiencing an AE leading to dose delay (Table 23). Of subjects who experienced dose 
delays, most experienced only 1 delay, and the majority of cycle delays were ≤14 days.

A safety update for CA209025 with a database lock (DBL) of 21-Aug-2015, 15.8% of subjects on the 
nivolumab arm and 6.5% of subjects on the everolimus arm remained on study treatment, and all subjects 
have had a minimum of 16 months of follow-up. No new safety signals were identified in CA209025 with the 
longer follow-up. The database lock point of the safety profile for CA209025 is for 18-Jun-2015. 
Adverse events 
The primary analyses of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation are based on all treated subjects 
using  a  safety  window  of  30  days  after  last  dose.  The  30-day  safety  window  was  intended  to  provide  a 
characterization of the safety experience of nivolumab monotherapy without influence of AEs associated 
with subsequent therapies. Additional analyses with extended safety follow-up (using a 100-day window), 
although potentially confounded by subsequent therapies, were conducted to assess differences in safety 
potentially due to late occurring AEs. 
Safety with Extended Follow-up 
Overall, similar frequencies were observed for all-causality, any-grade AEs reported within 100 days of the 
last dose (extended follow up) compared to those reported within 30 days for the nivolumab group. 
•  With extended follow-up, the frequencies of all-causality, all-grade SAEs, and Grade 5 SAEs/AEs 
increased  compared  to  the  frequencies  reported  within  30  days.  This  increase  was  observed  for 
subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  and  was  primarily  due  to  disease-related  deaths  as  would  be 
expected. 
• 
The frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs and drug-related SAEs reported 
within 100 days of last dose were consistent with those reported within 30 days of the last dose. 
A summary of the safety results in all treated subjects in study CA209025 is provided in the table below.

Study CA209010:  
In  CA209010  the  safety  profile  was  generally  similar  across  treatment  groups  and  the  types  of  events 
reported  were  as  expected  based  on  the  mechanism  of  action  of  nivolumab  and  previous  experience  in 
earlier studies (Table 26). 
Table 26: Summary of Safety Results - All Treated Subjects - CA209010 
Selected AEs - CA209025 
In  order  to  characterize  AEs  of  special  clinical  interest  that  are  potentially  associated  with  the  use  of 
nivolumab, the Applicant identified select AEs based on the following 4 guiding principles: 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 54/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies 
•  AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management 
•  AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity 
•  AEs  for  which  multiple  event  terms  may  be  used  to  describe  a  single  type  of  AE,  thereby 
necessitating the pooling of terms for full characterization. 
Based on these guiding principles and taking into account the types of AEs already observed across studies 
of nivolumab monotherapy, endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, 
and rash are currently considered to be select AEs. Multiple event terms that may describe each of these 
were grouped into endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and skin select AE categories, 
respectively. 
Analysis of AEs belonging to select AE categories were not performed on an individual term level, but instead 
include all terms in each select AE category. The composite group of MedDRA PTs belonging to each select 
AE category was included in each individual select AE section below. Events of special clinical interest that do 
not benefit from pooling of multiple terms were analyzed outside of the context of the select AE categories. 
Hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  analyzed  along  with  the  select  AE  categories  because  multiple 
event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling of terms was therefore necessary for full 
characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered select 
AEs. 
Among nivolumab-treated subjects, skin, GI, renal and hepatic were the most frequently reported select AE 
categories (≥ 15% of subjects), regardless of causality. The majority of select AEs reported were Grade 1-2, 
and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported (> 10% of subjects) any grade drug-related select AE category with nivolumab 
treatment was skin (24.9%), followed by GI (12.6%), and hepatic (11.3%). The most frequently reported 
(≥  1%  of  subjects)  Grade  3-4  drug-related  select  AE  categories  with  nivolumab  treatment  were  hepatic 
(2.7%), GI (2.0%), pulmonary (1.5%); endocrine, renal and skin were each reported by 1.0% of subjects. 
The  median  time  to  onset  varied  among  the  select  AE  categories.  Drug-related  hypersensitivity/infusion 
reaction select AEs (any grade) had a median time to onset < 6 weeks after initiation of nivolumab treatment 
whereas all other categories had a median time to onset > 6 weeks. 
The time to resolution also varied among the select AE categories. Most drug-related select AEs (any grade) 
in the GI, pulmonary, and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction categories had a median time to resolution < 6 
weeks after onset. Those in the hepatic category had a median time to resolution 8.00 weeks; while renal 
and  skin  categories  had  a  median  time  to  resolution  of  31.14  and  20.14  weeks,  respectively.  Most  AEs 
belonging  to  the  endocrine  select  AE  category  had  not  yet  resolved  due  to  the  continuing  need  for 
replacement therapy. 
Endocrine Events - CA209025 
The endocrine select AE category included the following subcategories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, pituitary 
disorders, and thyroid disorders. These terms were selected to encompass those considered most likely to 
be reported in a subject with an endocrinopathy belonging to the subcategories above. 
Endocrine select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 12.3% of subjects in the nivolumab group 
and 4.8% of subjects in the everolimus group. The majority of endocrine select AEs in the nivolumab group 
were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
In the nivolumab group: 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 55/84 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Drug-related  endocrine  select  AEs  were  reported  in  39  subjects  (9.6%)  and  the  majority  of  the 
events reported were hypothyroidism (24 subjects [5.9%]). 
• 
There  were  4  subjects  (1.0%)  with  Grade  3-4  drug-related  events.  Three  of  these  events  were 
considered serious drug-related events (Grade 3-4): 2 subjects (0.5%) had adrenal insufficiency 
drug-related SAEs, and 1 subject (0.2%) had a diabetic ketoacidosis drug-related SAE. 
•  One subject (0.2%) reported drug-related events of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis that led 
to treatment discontinuation. 
The median time to onset for any grade drug-related endocrine select AE was 16.00 weeks 
• 
•  Eight  subjects  with  a  drug-related  event  were  treated  with  immune-modulating  medication,  3 
subjects received high-dose corticosteroids. 
•  Overall,  14  (35.9%)  of  the  39  subjects  with  drug-related  endocrine  AEs  had  resolution  of  their 
events. 
•  A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the endocrine select AE category reported 
within 100 days of last dose compared to those reported within 30 days of the last dose.  
Gastrointestinal Events - CA209025 
The  GI  select  AE  category  included  the  following  terms:  autoimmune  colitis,  colitis  ulcerative,  diarrhea, 
enteritis,  enterocolitis,  frequent  bowel  movements,  and  GI  perforation.  These  terms  were  selected  to 
encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with diarrhea or colitis. 
The  frequency  of  GI  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any  grade)  was  lower  in  the  nivolumab  group  than  in  the 
everolimus group (24.4% vs 31.2%, respectively). The frequency of drug-related GI select AEs (any grade) 
was also lower in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus group (12.6% vs 21.2%, respectively). 
In the nivolumab group: 
•  All  drug-related  events  reported  were  diarrhea  (12.3%)  or  colitis  (1.7%),  and  the  majority  of 
drug-related  GI  select  AEs  were  Grade  1-2.  Seven  drug-related  GI  select  AEs  were  reported  as 
SAEs; for 4 subjects, the AEs led to discontinuation of study therapy. 
- 
There  were  5  subjects  with  Grade  3  diarrhea  events  reported:  2  subjects  had  SAEs  of 
diarrhea; 2 subjects had 2 AEs of diarrhea; 1 subject had 4 events of diarrhea reported (2 
AEs and 2 SAEs). There were no Grade 4 or 5 events reported. 
- 
There were 3 subjects with Grade 3 colitis events reported, each subject had 1 event. For 2 
of the 3 subjects, the events of colitis were SAEs and drug was withdrawn. There were no 
Grade 4 or 5 events reported. 
• 
The median time to onset for any grade drug-related GI select AE was 8.29 weeks. The median time 
to onset of the Grade 3 drug-related events was 20.71 weeks. 
•  Eleven subjects received immune-modulating medication (high-dose corticosteroids in 10 of the 11 
cases) for drug-related GI select AEs. 
• 
The majority of subjects (44 subjects [86.3%]) with drug-related GI AEs (any grade) had resolution 
of  their  event.  All  but  1  subject  with  Grade  3  drug-related  GI  select  AEs  had  resolution  of  their 
events. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related GI select AEs was 5.57 weeks. 
•  A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the GI select AE category reported within 100 
days  of  last  dose  compared  to  those  reported  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose.  One  additional 
drug-related Grade 3 SAE of diarrhea was reported during the extended follow-up period (between 
30 and 100 days after last dose).

Hepatic Events- CA209025 
The  hepatic  select  AE  category  included  the  following  terms:  acute  hepatic  failure,  ALT  increased,  AST 
increased,  autoimmune  hepatitis,  bilirubin  conjugated  increased,  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased, 
blood  bilirubin  increased,  drug-induced  liver  injury,  GGT  increased,  hepatic  enzyme  increased,  hepatic 
failure,  hepatitis,  hepatitis  acute,  hepatotoxicity,  hyperbilirubinemia,  liver  disorder,  liver  function  test 
abnormal, liver injury, and transaminases increased. These terms were selected to encompass those most 
likely to be reported in a subject with hepatitis. 
Hepatic  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any-grade)  were  reported  in  16.0%  of  subjects  in  the  nivolumab  and 
11.3% of subjects in the everolimus groups. 
In the nivolumab group: 
•  Drug-related hepatic select AEs were reported in 46 (11.3%) subjects, and increased ALT, increased 
blood ALP, and increased AST were the most frequently reported drug-related hepatic select AEs. 
The majority of drug-related hepatic select AEs were Grade 1-2. 
• 
•  Eleven subjects (2.7%) reported Grade 3-4 drug-related hepatic select events, and most of the AEs 
were laboratory abnormalities. One of these subjects reported a serious drug-related hepatic select 
event  for  autoimmune  hepatitis  (and  increased  transaminase)  (Grade  3)  that  led  to  study 
medication discontinuation. In addition, the following subjects discontinued study medication (all 
grades): 4 subjects (1.0%) discontinued due to increased ALT, and 3 subjects (0.7%) discontinued 
due to increased AST. 
• 
• 
• 
The median time to onset of any grade drug-related hepatic AE was 7.21 weeks. The median time to 
onset of the Grade 3-4 drug-related events (in 11 subjects) was 4.14 weeks. 
Five subjects received immune-modulating medication (high-dose corticosteroids in all cases) for 
drug-related hepatic select AEs. 
The  majority  of  the  subjects  (37  subjects  [82.2%])  with  drug-related  hepatic  select  AEs  had 
resolution  of  their  event.  Ten  of  the  11  Grade  3-4  drug-related  events  resolved,  and  all  of  the 
subjects  with  Grade  3-4  drug-related  events  who  received  immune-modulating  medication  had 
resolution of their event. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related hepatic select AE 
was 8.00 weeks. 
•  A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the hepatic select AE category reported within 
100 days of last dose compared to those reported within 30 days of the last dose. 
Pulmonary Events - CA209025 
The pulmonary select AE category included the following terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute 
respiratory failure, interstitial lung disease, lung infiltration, and pneumonitis. These terms were selected to 
encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with pneumonitis. Although hypoxia and dyspnea 
are not included as terms in this category, all events of hypoxia and clinically important events of dyspnea 
(Grade 1-2 requiring dose modification, Grade 2 requiring treatment, or Grade 3-4) occurring on or after the 
first day of dosing, were systematically queried by the Sponsor to confirm that an underlying diagnosis such 
as pneumonitis, rather than a sign or symptom related to another etiology, was reported if available. 
Pneumonia was not included as a term in the pulmonary select AE category because of the high frequency 
with  which  it  was  expected  to  be  reported,  especially  to  describe  infectious  etiologies  rather  than 
non-infectious pneumonitis. The inclusion of pneumonia as a select AE term would hinder characterization of 
the true frequency of pneumonitis. 
Pulmonary  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any-grade)  were  reported  in  fewer  subjects  in  the  nivolumab  group 
compared  with  the  everolimus  group  (5.7%  vs  18.6%).  The  majority  of  pulmonary  select  AEs  in  the 
nivolumab group were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016

In the nivolumab group: 
•  Drug-related pulmonary select AEs were reported in 18 subjects (4.4%). 
• 
Pneumonitis  (3.9%)  and  interstitial  lung  disease  (0.5%)  were  the  only  drug-related  pulmonary 
select AEs reported. 
• 
The majority of drug-related AEs were Grade 1-2. Drug-related Grade 3-4 events of pneumonitis 
were reported in 6 subjects (5 subjects with Grade 3 and 1 subject with Grade 4 events). There were 
no Grade 3-4 interstitial lung disease events reported. 
•  All 6 drug-related Grade 3-4 pulmonary AEs were considered SAEs; all but 1 event led to treatment 
discontinuation.  
• 
• 
• 
The median time to onset of any-grade drug-related pulmonary select AE was 16.57 weeks. The 
median time to onset of the Grade 3-4 drug-related events (in 6 subjects) was 15.79 weeks. 
Fourteen of the 18 subjects with drug-related pulmonary select AEs received immunemodulating 
medication (12 were high-dose corticosteroids); all 5 subjects with Grade 3-4 events were treated 
with high-dose corticosteroids. 
Fifteen of the 18 subjects (83.3%) with events (any grade) had resolution of their events. Five of the 
Grade 3-4 pulmonary events resolved; 1 event of pneumonitis was ongoing at the time of database 
lock. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related pulmonary select AE was 5.57 weeks. 
A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the pulmonary select AE category reported within 100 
days of last dose compared to those reported within 30 days of the last dose. No additional drug-related 
events were reported during the extended follow-up period (between 30 and 100 days after last dose). 
Renal Events - CA209025 
The renal select AE category included the following terms: acute kidney injury, blood creatinine increased, 
blood urea increased, creatinine renal clearance decreased, hypercreatinemia, nephritis, nephritis allergic, 
nephritis  autoimmune,  renal  failure,  renal  tubular  necrosis,  tubulointerstitial  nephritis,  and  urine  output 
decreased.  These  terms  were  selected  to  encompass  those  most  likely  to  be  reported  in  a  subject  with 
nephritis. 
Renal select AEs (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in 17.5% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 
14.1%  of  subjects  in  the  everolimus  group.  Drug-related  renal  select  AEs  were  similar  between  the  2 
groups: 6.9% and 8.8% in nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively. 
In the nivolumab group: 
•  Grade 3-4 drug-related renal select AEs included: increased blood creatinine (0.2%), acute kidney 
injury (0.7%), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (0.2%). Three subjects (0.7%) reported drug-related 
renal select SAEs. 
-  1 subject had 4-Grade 3 and 1-Grade 4 increased blood creatinine events, and this subject 
also had a SAE reported of acute kidney injury (Grade 4), which led to study medication 
discontinuation. 
-  1  subject  had  a  SAE  of  tubulointerstitial  nephritis  (Grade  3),  and  study  medication  was 
discontinued due to this SAE. 
-  1 subject had a SAE of acute kidney injury (Grade 3), and 1 subject had an AE of acute 
kidney injury (Grade 3). 
• 
The median time to onset of any grade drug-related renal AE in the nivolumab group was 10.64 
weeks. 
•  Seven subjects with drug-related renal select AEs received immune-modulating medication (all high 
dose corticosteroids). 
•  Sixteen (59.3%) of the 27 subjects in the nivolumab group with drug-related renal select AEs had 
resolution  of  their  event.  Two  subjects  with  Grade  3-4  events  who  received  immune-modulating 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016

medication had resolution of their event in 1.57 weeks. The median time to resolution for any grade 
drug-related renal select AE was 31.14 weeks. 
A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the renal select AE category reported up to 100 days 
after last dose compared to those reported up to 30 days after last dose. 
Skin Events - CA209025 
The  skin  select  AE  category  included  the  following  terms:  autoimmune  dermatitis,  blister,  dermatitis, 
dermatitis  exfoliative,  drug  eruption,  eczema,  erythema,  erythema  multiform,  exfoliative  rash, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, photosensitivity reaction, pruritus, pruritus allergic, pruritus 
generalized, psoriasis, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash 
papular, rash pruritic, skin exfoliation, skin hypopigmentation, skin irritation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, and vitiligo. These terms were selected to encompass those most likely 
to be reported in a subject with rash. 
Skin select AEs (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in fewer subjects in the nivolumab group (37.2%) 
compared  with  the  everolimus  group  (44.6%).  Most  of  the  skin  select  AEs  were  considered  to  be 
drug-related by the investigator in both treatment groups. 
In the nivolumab group: 
•  Drug-related skin select AEs were reported in 101 (24.9%) subjects. 
• 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  terms  (>  1%  of  subjects)  were  pruritus,  rash,  rash 
maculo-papular, and erythema. 
There was no event of toxic epidermal necrolysis reported. 
The majority of drug-related select skin AEs were Grade 1-2; there were 4-Grade 3 drug-related 
• 
• 
events reported (rash, rash macular, and rash maculo-papular). There were no Grade 4 or 5 events. 
•  One  subject  (0.2%)  had  a  drug-related  skin  select  SAE  (erythema  multiforme),  and  1  subject 
(0.2%) reported an AE of rash maculo-papular, which led to study medication discontinuation. 
• 
• 
The median time to onset of any grade drug-related skin AE was 8.29 weeks. 
Thirty-one subjects (30.7%) with drug-related events received immune-modulating medication (2 
subjects received high dose corticosteroids). 
•  Seventy-five (75.8%) of the 99 subjects with drug-related skin select AEs had resolution of their 
event, including 21 of the subjects treated with immune-modulating medication. All 4 subjects with 
Grade 3 drug-related skin select AEs had resolution of their events. The median time to resolution of 
any grade drug-related skin select AE was 20.14 weeks. 
A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the skin select AE category reported up to 100 days 
after last dose compared to those reported up to 30 days after last dose. 
Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions - CA209025 
Hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  analyzed  along  with  the  select  AE  categories  because  multiple 
event  terms  may  be  used  to  describe  such  events  and  pooling  of  terms  is  therefore  necessary  for  full 
characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered a select 
AE.  Hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  included  the  following  terms:  anaphylactic  reaction,  anaphylactic 
shock, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity, and infusionrelated reaction. 
Hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in 6.2% of subjects in 
the nivolumab group and 1.0% in the everolimus group. Most of the hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were 
considered to be drug-related by investigators. 
In the nivolumab group: 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 59/84 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Drug-related hypersensitivity and infusion reactions were reported in 21 subjects (5.2%). 
• 
There  was  1  SAE  reported  of  anaphylactic  reaction,  Grade  4,  which  led  to  study  medication 
discontinuation. One subject also discontinued study medication due to an AE of an infusion-related 
reaction (Grade 2). 
• 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  any  grade  drug-related  hypersensitivity/infusion  reaction  was  2.00 
weeks. 
•  Seven subjects with drug-related events received immune-modulating medication; 3 received high 
dose corticosteroids. 
•  All subjects with drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions had resolution of their event. The 
median  time  to  resolution  of  any  grade  drug-related  hypersensitivity/infusion  reaction  was  0.14 
weeks. 
No  new  Grade  3-4  hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  reported  in  the  extended  follow-up  period 
between 30 and 100 days after last dose. 
Select AEs – CA209010 
Select Adverse Events in all treated subjects for study CA209010 are summarized in the table below. 
Table 27: Summary of Select Adverse Events - All Treated Subjects - CA209010 
Adverse drug reactions  
Safety data to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC were pooled across completed studies in multiple indications 
using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab monotherapy. The studies included in the analyses for 
nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W) were as follows: three studies in NSCLC (CA209057, CA209017, 
and CA209063), three studies in melanoma (CA209037, CA209066, and CA209067 [monotherapy arm]) 
and one study in renal cell carcinoma (CA209025).

The general safety profile in the pooled monotherapy data across indications is consistent with the safety 
reported for each indication.  
The studies used for the pooling of safety data are summarized in the table below. 
Table 28: Overview of Nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy phase 2/3 studies in NSCLC, Melanoma and RCC 
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in the different indications is consistent. 
In general, the type, frequency, and severity of AEs were consistent across tumour types. 
Exposure-adjusted  AE  incidence  rates  (events  per  100  person-years  of  exposure)  were  1648.7  in  RCC, 
1747.7 in melanoma, and 1795.6 in NSCLC.

In addition, Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been included in the SmPC as ADR following the report of 
3 cases of fatal TEN during on-going routine pharmacovigilance (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0004). 
Safety of nivolumab monotherapy across tumour types 
The  safety  profile  of  nivolumab  3  mg/kg  monotherapy  in  RCC  was  compared  to  the  recently  submitted 
pooled safety profiles of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC. 
Studies submitted in support of approval used for comparison of safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy 
in RCC versus other tumour types (melanoma and NSCLC) are summarized in Table 30. The mean duration 
of nivolumab therapy and the number of nivolumab doses received was higher in RCC than melanoma and 
NSCLC.

Melanoma, and NSCLC 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events - CA209025 
The overall frequencies of all-causality SAEs (any grade) were similar between the treatment groups (Table 
31).  The  SAE  rates  represent  those  for  any  causality  (i.e.  reported  as  related  or  not  related  by  the 
investigator). 
Pleural effusion was considered related to study therapy in each arm. All cases of spinal cord compression in 
both arms were considered not related to study therapy and most often related to metastatic disease. There 
were two cases of Grade 3-4 acute kidney injury that were considered related to study therapy in each arm.  
All reported cases of malignant neoplasm progression were indicated as not related to study therapy on both 
arms.  Other  neoplasms  unrelated  to  RCC  were  reported  on  both  arms  and  were  not  categorized  as 
“Malignant  neoplasm  progression.”  These  included  cases  of  skin  cancers  (basal,  squamous,  melanoma). 
Nivolumab subjects had reports of basal cell and squamous cell (3 each) and malignant melanoma (1). For 
everolimus there was one report of basal cell. In addition, other types of potentially new neoplasms reported 
included; neoplasm (1), neoplasm malignant (1) and lung adenocarcinoma (1) for the nivolumab arm, and 
Assessment report

duodenal  neoplasm,  lymphangiosis  carcinomatosa,  peritoneal  neoplasm,  neoplasm  and  oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma (1 each) for the everolimus arm. 
Table 31: Summary of Serious Adverse Events by Worst CTC Grade - (Any Grade, Grade 3-4, Grade 5) with 
1% Cutoff - All Treated Subjects - CA209025 
Study CA209010 
The CA209010 CSR included narratives for all nivolumab-treated subjects who experienced a related serious 
adverse event (SAE, “related” or “missing” relationship per investigator’s assessment), discontinued study 
therapy due to an AE, died due to reason other than progressive disease, or had other significant medical 
events, within 100 days of last dose as defined by the old narrative criteria. In addition, narratives for all 
nivolumab subjects who experienced any Grade 2 related select AE requiring systemic immunosuppressants 
to treat the AE were also provided. 
Other Events of Special Interest - CA209025 
Other events of special interest are events that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as select AEs. These events 
may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require immunosuppression as part of their 
management, but do not benefit from pooling of multiple AE terms for full characterization and are therefore 
presented as unique events rather than using select AE methodology. Other select event categories included 
myasthenic syndrome, demyelination, Guillain-Barré syndrome, pancreatitis, and uveitis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 65/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
No  events  of  myasthenic  syndrome,  demyelination,  Guillain-Barré  syndrome,  and  encephalitis  were 
reported in either the nivolumab or everolimus treatment groups. 
The only event of special interest requiring treatment with immune-modulating medication was 1 case of 
uveitis in the nivolumab treatment group (extended follow-up): 
• 
Immune-mediated uveitis where immune modulating mediation was initiated occurred in 1 (0.2%) 
subject in the nivolumab group and no subjects in the everolimus group. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The nivolumab-treated subject experienced Grade 2 iridocyclitis that was not considered an 
SAE. 
This  event  did  not  lead  to  treatment  discontinuation  or  dose  delay.  The  subject  was 
continuing nivolumab at the time of database lock. 
The time to onset was 34.71 weeks. 
The subject received a topical corticosteroid (intraocular administration) for treatment of 
the event. 
The event resolved (per investigator assessment) in 3.14 weeks. The subject had complete 
resolution (i.e., resolution with completion of immune-modulating medication). 
The  subject  was  re-challenged  with  nivolumab  treatment  and  had  a  successful/negative 
re-challenge (i.e., no recurrence with re-treatment). 
In  addition  events  of  special  interest  not  requiring  treatment  with  immune-modulating  medication  were 
reported (extended follow-up) in 2 nivolumab-treated subjects. 
• 
Immune-mediated  pancreatitis  (not  treated  with  immune-modulating  medication)  occurred  in  2 
(0.5%) subjects in the nivolumab group and no subjects in the everolimus group. In the nivolumab 
group: 
- 
There  was  1  subject  with  Grade  2  pancreatitis  that  was  not  considered  an  SAE  and  was  not 
drug-related and 1 subject with Grade 3 pancreatitis that was considered an SAE and was not 
drug related. 
-  Neither event led to treatment discontinuation and the Grade 3 event resulted in dose delay. 
- 
The median time to onset was 20.29 weeks (range: 16.6 to 24.0 weeks). 
-  As stated above, neither event was treated with immune-modulating concomitant medication. 
-  Both  pancreatitis  events  resolved  (per  investigator  assessment),  with  a  median  time  to 
resolution of 16.29 weeks (range 9.1 to 23.4 weeks). 
Another event of special interest observed in CA209025 was systemic inflammatory response syndrome. 
One  subject  (CA209025-29-988)  had  2  Grade  3  drug-related  SAEs  of  systemic  inflammatory  response 
syndrome  reported  during  the  extended  follow-up  period  (start/stop:  22-Dec-2014  to  24-Dec-2014  and 
20-Jan-2015 to 29-Jan-2015). The subject was treated with systemic corticosteroids from 07-Jan-2015 to 
17-Jan-2015 and 21-Jan-2015 to 23-Jan-2015, and both events resolved. 
There were no events of toxic epidermal necrolysis reported in CA209025. 
Deaths - CA209025 
Prior to the database lock point, fewer subjects had died in the nivolumab group (181 subjects [44.6%]) 
compared with the everolimus group (213 subjects [53.7%]); see Table 32. 
•  Disease  progression  was  the  most  common  cause  of  death  for  both  groups,  including  deaths 
occurring within 30 days of last dose and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. 
•  No  deaths  were  attributed  to  study  drug  toxicity  with  nivolumab,  and  2  deaths  (0.5%)  in  the 
everolimus group were assessed as study drug toxicity: 1 of the subjects died due to septic shock

(Subject  CA209025-118-160)  and  1  of  the  subjects  died  due  to  acute  bowel  ischaemia  (Subject 
CA209025-97-286). 
•  A reason for death of “other” was reported by the investigator for 14 subjects in the nivolumab group 
(none  were  assessed  as  related  to  nivolumab)  and  10  subjects  in  the  everolimus  group,  and 
“unknown” for 4 subjects in the nivolumab group, and 8 subjects in the everolimus group. These 
verbatim terms were consistent with events expected in the population under study.

Laboratory findings  
Haematology 
Haematology  was  assessed  through  laboratory  evaluation  of  haemoglobin,  platelet  count,  leukocytes, 
lymphocytes, and absolute neutrophils. 
In  CA209025,  the  majority  of  subjects  in  the  nivolumab  group  did  not  have  on-study  worsening  in 
haematology. Any-grade abnormalities in haematology laboratory results relative to baseline were reported 
less frequently in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (Table 33). 
• 
• 
The majority of haematology laboratory abnormalities reported in the nivolumab group were Grade 
1-2. 
The only Grade 3-4 haematologic abnormalities reported in ≥5% of subjects in the nivolumab group 
was  haemoglobin  decrease  (8.4%)  and  absolute  lymphocyte  count  decrease  (6.4%).  In  the 
everolimus  group,  Grade  3-4  haemoglobin  decrease  (15.7%)  and  absolute  lymphocyte  count 
decrease (11.2%) were also reported in ≥5% of subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016

•  No haematology laboratory abnormalities occurred in ≥10% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 
at a higher frequency than in the everolimus group (between-group difference of ≥5% [all grades] 
or ≥2% [Grades 3-4]). 
A low number of nivolumab and everolimus treated subjects experienced a ≥2-grade shift from baseline to 
a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality.

Baseline - Reported Within 30 Days of Last Dose for All Treated Subjects (SI Units) - CA209025 
Serum Chemistry - CA209025 
Liver parameters  
Liver function was assessed through serum chemistry laboratories (AST, ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin) and 
review of AEs related to hepatic function abnormalities. 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups did not have on-study worsening in liver function tests. 
Most abnormalities in liver function were Grade 1-2 in both treatment groups (Table 34). 
Table 34: Summary of On-Treatment Worst CTC Grade Liver Function Test Results that Worsened Relative to 
Baseline - Reported Within 30 Days of Last Dose (SI Units) - All Treated Subjects - CA209025 
Grade 3-4 ALT increases occurred at a higher frequency (≥2% difference) in the nivolumab group than in the 
everolimus group (3.2% vs 0.8%).

The  number  of  subjects  who  experienced  a  ≥2-grade  shift  from  baseline  to  a  Grade  3-4  laboratory 
abnormality in either treatment group was low. 
In the nivolumab group, 3 (0.7%) subjects had concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3 x ULN with total bilirubin 
> 2 x ULN within 1 day of last dose of study therapy, and 4 (1.0%) subjects had concurrent ALT or AST 
elevation > 3 x ULN with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 30 days of last dose of study therapy (Table 35).

Serum creatinine that worsened relative to baseline (any grade) was reported in 42.2% of subjects in the 
nivolumab group and 44.9% of subjects in the everolimus group. Changes in serum creatinine during the 
study were similar between the two treatment groups. Grade 3-4 abnormalities in serum creatinine were 
reported in 2.0% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 1.6% of subjects in the everolimus group. 
It  was  acknowledged  that  GFR  was  not  a  significant  covariate  on  nivolumab  CL  and  had  no  meaningful 
clinical  relevance  on  nivolumab  CL  (<20%  effect  on  CL).  As  renal  impairment  does  not  affect 
pharmacokinetics of nivolumab, it is not expected to have an impact on the safety profile. No nivolumab 
dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment. 
Thyroid function tests 
The majority of subjects in both groups had normal TSH levels at baseline and throughout the treatment 
period (Table 36). 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects with elevated TSH > ULN who had TSH ≤ULN at baseline was higher in the 
nivolumab group than the everolimus group (19.6% and 10.5%, respectively). The proportion of 
subjects with TSH > ULN and at least 1 FT3/FT4 value < LLN was higher in the nivolumab group 
(13.4%) than the everolimus group (5.0%). 
The proportion of subjects with TSH < LLN with at least 1 FT3/FT4 test value > ULN was higher in the 
nivolumab group (5.0%) than the everolimus group (2.5%). 
•  No meaningful differences were noted between treatment groups for subjects with on treatment 
TSH < LLN who had TSH ≥LLN at baseline.

Electrolytes 
Most subjects in both treatment groups had normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period 
(Table  37).  Abnormalities  in  electrolytes  were  primarily  Grade  1  to  2  in  severity.  Hypercalcaemia, 
hyperkalaemia, and hyponatraemia occurred in ≥10% of subjects in the nivolumab group and at a higher 
frequency than in the everolimus group (between-group difference of ≥5% [all grades] or ≥2% [Grades 
3-4]).

A  summary  of  the  anti-drug  antibody  (ADA)  assessments  for  nivolumab  subjects  in  CA209025  who  had 
evaluable ADA data at baseline and on treatment is presented in Table 38. 
Overall,  there  were  27  (7.3%)  subjects  who  were  ADA  positive,  of  which  only  1  (0.3%)  subject  was 
considered  persistent  positive  (CA209025-31-317)  and  no  subjects  were  neutralizing  ADA  positive.  The 
highest titer value observed in ADA positive subjects was 256, which occurred in only 1 subject. This subject 
had only one ADA positive sample observed at 2 weeks after initiation of nivolumab dosing and no other ADA 
positive samples (subject included in the Other positive category). All other ADA positive subjects had titer 
values less than 16.

- All Nivolumab-treated Subjects with Baseline and at Least One Post-Baseline Assessment - CA209025 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety - CA209025 
In CA209025, a total of 26 subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reaction events within 100 days of 
last dose (extended follow-up), and all were ADA negative (Table 39). Thus, the presence of ADA was not 
associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity and/or infusion related reactions. Overall, the incidence of 
nivolumab ADA was low and did not appear to have an effect on the safety of nivolumab.

Integrated Immunogenicity Summary 
Collectively to date, of 1408 subjects with solid tumors including RCC, NSCLC, and melanoma, who were 
treated  with  nivolumab  3  mg/kg  every  2  weeks  and  evaluable  for  the  presence  of  ADA,  155  subjects 
(11.0%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA (Table 40). Of those who were ADA positive, only 2 
subjects (0.1% of the total) were persistent positive, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 9 
subjects (0.6% of the total).

Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Every 2 weeks - 16-week Definition for Persistent Positive 
Immunogenicity Results - CA209010 
Of  the  133  nivolumab-treated  subjects  who  had  evaluable  ADA  data  at  baseline  and  postbaseline,  15 
(11.3%) subjects were ADA positive at baseline. During treatment with nivolumab, ADA were detected in 21 
(15.8%) subjects, of whom 3 (2.3%) subjects were considered as persistent positive; and 112 (84.2%) 
subjects were ADA negative. A higher percentage of subjects were ADA positive in the 0.3 mg/kg treatment 
group than in the 2 mg/kg treatment group, and no subjects were ADA positive in the 10 mg/kg treatment 
group. The decrease in immunogenicity with increasing dose level could be due to drug tolerance of the ADA 
assay used. The safety profile of the 3 persistent positive subjects (CA209010-18-89, CA209010-52-198, 
and CA209010-54-150) was no different from those seen in the general population; no new or additional AEs 
were  reported  in  these  subjects.  The  limited  number  of  persistent  positive  subjects  precludes  any 
interpretation  or  definitive  conclusion  regarding  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  nivolumab  in  these  subjects 
compared to ADA-negative subjects. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors - CA209025 
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab group for subgroups of gender, race, 
age,  and  region  were  similar  to  the  AE  frequencies  in  the  overall  treated  population.  Small  numerical 
differences  in  frequencies  of  all-causality  AEs  of  any  grade  and  Grade  3-4  AEs  were  observed  in 
nivolumab-treated subjects in the following subgroups: for Black/African American (n = 1) and “other” races 
(n = 13), age (≥75 and < 85 [n = 30], ≥85 years [n = 4]), and in the “rest of world” regions (n = 95). These 
differences are of limited interpretability due to low sample sizes and event rates, and do not alter the overall 
safety profile of nivolumab in these subgroups. 
Age 
The  frequency  of  total  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  and  AEs  by  MedDRA  High-level  Group  Term 
(HLGT)/ Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ)/SOC appear similar for subjects < 75 years vs ≥ 75 years; 
however, interpretation is limited by small numbers of subjects in the older subgroups, particularly for the ≥ 
85 years age group (Table 41).

In  CA209025,  the  overall  frequency  of  all-causality,  any  grade  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study 
therapy (any grade and Grade 3-4) were similar between the nivolumab and everolimus groups (Table 42).

Table 42: Summary of Adverse Events (≥1) Leading to Discontinuation by Worst CTC Grade - (Any Grade, 
Grade 3-4, Grade 5) - All Treated Subjects - CA209025 
Overall frequencies of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy (any grade and Grade 
3-4) were lower in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group. 
Any-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were reported at a lower frequency 
in  the  nivolumab  group  (7.6%)  than  the  everolimus  group  (13.1%).  In  the  nivolumab  group,  the  most 
frequently  reported  all-grade  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (≥1%  of  subjects)  were 
pneumonitis  (1.2%)  and  ALT  increased  (1.0%).  In  the  everolimus  group,  the  most  frequently  reported 
all-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (≥1% of subjects) were: pneumonitis (3.0%), cough 
(1.0%), and fatigue (1.0%). 
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were reported at a lower frequency 
in the nivolumab group (4.7%) than the everolimus group (7.1%). In the nivolumab group, pneumonitis 
(1.2%) was the only Grade 3-4 drug-related AE leading to discontinuation reported by ≥1% of subjects. In 
the  everolimus  group,  pneumonitis  (1.3%)  was  the  only  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AE  leading  to 
discontinuation reported by ≥1% of subjects. 
Post marketing experience 
No new significant safety concerns were identified based on the postmarketing reports. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For the purpose of this application, the population from study CA209025 was considered the main safety 
dataset. Supportive data from CA209010, dose-ranging study was included. 
Baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  in  study  CA209025  were  well  balanced  between  the 
nivolumab and everolimus groups, except for the gender (male 75.4%). The patient population and baseline 
characteristics in CA209010 were comparable to that in CA209025.  
The median duration of therapy in the nivolumab treatment group was longer at 5.54 months compared with 
the everolimus group at 3.71 months.  
At  the  time  of  the  database  lock  point  (18-Jun-2015),  88%  of  subjects  had  discontinued  study  therapy 
(83.5% in the nivolumab group and 92.9% in the everolimus group). Across treatment groups, the most 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 74/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
common  reason  for  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  was  disease  progression  (70.2%  and  68.8%  in  the 
nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively). In the nivolumab group, 51.0% of subjects had at least 
one dose delayed, with 43.6% of subjects in the nivolumab group experiencing an AE leading to dose delay. 
A lower proportion of subjects discontinued study therapy due to study drug toxicity in the nivolumab group 
compared with the everolimus group (8.6% vs. 13.4%).  
Any-grade AEs were reported in 97.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 97.2% of subjects in the 
everolimus group.  
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 53.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 56.4% of subjects in the 
everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the only Grade 3-4 AE reported in ≥5% of subjects was anemia 
(5.9%).  
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus 
group (78.6% vs 87.9%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (33.0%) was the only any-grade drug-related AE 
that occurred in ≥20% of subjects. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were also reported less frequently in the 
nivolumab group than the everolimus group (18.7% vs 36.5%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (2.5%) was 
the only Grade 3-4 drug-related AE that occurred in ≥2% of subjects.  
Any-grade SAEs were reported in 47.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 43.6% of subjects in the 
everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were 
malignant  neoplasm  progression  (5.4%),  pleural  effusion  (3.4%),  pneumonia  (2.7%),  hypercalcemia 
(2.5%), pneumonitis (2.0%), spinal cord compression (2.0%), and acute kidney injury (2.0%).  
Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 36.5% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 29.2% of subjects in the 
everolimus group.  
Any-grade  drug-related SAEs were reported in 11.6% of subjects in the nivolumab group  and 13.4% of 
subjects in the everolimus group.  
The overall frequency of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation was lower in the nivolumab group than 
the everolimus group for all-grade events (7.6% vs 13.1%) and Grade 3-4 events (4.7% vs 7.1%). The 
overall  frequency  of  drug-related  AEs  was  lower  in  the  nivolumab  group  than  the  everolimus  group  for 
all-grade events (78.6% vs 87.9%) and Grade 3-4 events (18.7% vs 36.5%). 
The overall frequencies of all-causality SAEs (any grade) were similar between the treatment groups.  
Across  select  AE  categories,  the  majority  of  events  were  manageable,  with  resolution  occurring  when 
immune-modulating  medications  (mostly  systemic  corticosteroids)  were  administered.  Some  endocrine 
select AEs, though well-controlled with hormone replacement therapy, were not considered resolved due to 
the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. 
Drug-related  renal  select  AEs  were  similar  between  the  2  groups:  6.9%  and  8.8%  in  nivolumab  and 
everolimus groups, respectively. 
The most frequently reported (> 10% of subjects) any grade drug-related select AE category with nivolumab 
treatment was skin (24.9%), followed by GI (12.6%), and hepatic (11.3%). The most frequently reported 
(≥  1%  of  subjects)  Grade  3-4  drug-related  select  AE  categories  with  nivolumab  treatment  were  hepatic 
(2.7%), GI (2.0%), pulmonary (1.5%); endocrine, renal and skin were each reported by 1.0% of subjects. 
In the nivolumab group: 
* Drug-related endocrine select AEs were reported in 9.6% subjects and the majority of the events reported 
were hypothyroidism (5.9%). There  were 1.0%  subjects with Grade  3-4  drug-related  events (0.5%  had 
adrenal insufficiency and 0.2% had a diabetic ketoacidosis drug-related SAE). One subject (0.2%) reported 
drug-related events of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis that led to treatment discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 75/84 
 
  
  
 
* All drug-related GI events reported were diarrhea (12.3%) or colitis (1.7%), 7 drug-related GI select AEs 
were reported as SAEs; for 4 subjects, the AEs led to discontinuation of study therapy. 
* Drug-related hepatic select AEs were reported in 11.3% subjects, 2.7% reported Grade 3-4 drug. One of 
these  subjects  reported  a  serious  drug-related  hepatic  select  event  for  autoimmune  hepatitis,  1.0% 
discontinued due to increased ALT, and 0.7% discontinued due to increased AST. 
* Drug-related pulmonary select AEs were reported in 4.4% subjects. Pneumonitis (3.9%) and interstitial 
lung disease (0.5%) were the only drug-related pulmonary select AEs reported. 
*Grade 3-4 drug-related renal select AEs included: increased blood creatinine (0.2%), acute kidney injury 
(0.7%), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (0.2%). 0.7% reported drug-related renal select SAEs. 
* Drug-related skin select AEs were reported in 24.9% subjects. There was no event of  toxic epidermal 
necrolysis reported, 0.2% had a drug-related skin select SAE (erythema multiforme), 0.2% reported an AE 
of rash maculo-papular, which led to study medication discontinuation. Thirty-one subjects (30.7%) with 
drug-related  events  received 
immune-modulating  medication  (2  subjects  received  high  dose 
corticosteroids. 
Disease progression was the most common cause of death for both groups, including deaths occurring within 
30 days of last dose and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. In CA209025, there were fewer 
deaths  in  nivolumab  group  (44.6%,  181/406  subjects)  compared  with  the  everolimus  group  (53.7%, 
213/397 subjects) with the majority due to disease progression in both groups. No deaths were attributed to 
study drug toxicity with nivolumab. 
44.6% subjects treated with nivolumab died compared with 53.7% treated with everolimus.  
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab group for subgroups of gender, race, 
age, and region were similar to the AE frequencies in the overall treated population.  
The majority of subjects in the nivolumab group did not have on-study worsening in haematology laboratory 
parameters. Any-grade abnormalities in haematology laboratory results worsened relative to baseline were 
reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group. The majority of subjects in both 
treatment groups did not have on-study worsening in liver function tests. Most abnormalities in liver function 
were Grade 1-2 in both treatment groups. Serum creatinine that worsened relative to baseline (any grade) 
was reported in 42.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 44.9% of subjects in the everolimus group. 
Grade 3-4 abnormalities in serum creatinine were reported in 2.0% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 
1.6% of subjects in the everolimus group. The majority of subjects in both groups had normal TSH levels at 
baseline  and  throughout  the  treatment  period.  Most  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  normal 
electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period; abnormalities in electrolytes were primarily Grade 
1 to 2 in severity.  
A  lower  frequency  of  discontinuation  for  study  drug  toxicity  regardless  of  causality  was  observed  in  the 
nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (8.6% vs. 13.4%, respectively). In addition, there 
were fewer subjects who requested to discontinue study treatment in the nivolumab group compared with 
the everolimus group (1.2% vs. 4.5%).  
All-grade  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  reported  in  17.7%  of  subjects  in  the 
nivolumab group and 20.7% of subjects in the everolimus group.  
Grade  3-4  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  reported  in  11.1%  of  subjects  in  the 
nivolumab group and 11.3% of subjects in the everolimus group.  
The incidence of nivolumab-treated subjects with RCC who were positive for nivolumab ADA was 7.3%, and 
only  1  (0.3%)  subject  was  considered  persistent  positive.  No  subjects  were  positive  for  neutralizing 
antibodies.  In  CA209025,  a  total  of  26  nivolumab  treated  subjects  experienced  select  AEs  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/216066/2016 
Page 76/84 
 
  
  
 
hypersensitivity/infusion  reaction  category  (within  100  days  of  last  dose)  and  all  subjects  were  ADA 
negative.  Thus,  the  presence  of  ADA  was  not  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  hypersensitivity  and/or 
infusion-related reactions. Overall, the incidence of nivolumab ADA was low and did not appear to have an 
effect  on  the  safety  of  nivolumab.  These  findings  were  consistent  with  those  from  previous  analyses  of 
melanoma and NSCLC studies. 
Comparative safety data from CA209025 demonstrate that nivolumab monotherapy has an acceptable 
safety profile as compared to everolimus, as evidenced by the lower rates of drug-related AEs (all grades 
and Grade 3-4) and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (all grades and Grade 3-4) in the nivolumab 
group.  
There were no deaths attributed to nivolumab during the study. 
In CA209010 the safety profile was generally similar across treatment groups and the types of events 
reported were as expected based on the mechanism of action of nivolumab and previous experience in 
earlier studies. 
In general, the type, frequency, and severity of AEs were consistent between RCC and other tumor types 
(melanoma and NSCLC). Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in RCC was consistent with 
previously submitted pooled data of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in RCC was consistent with previously submitted pooled data 
of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC. No new safety concerns with nivolumab monotherapy 
treatment were identified in RCC. Based on safety data from Phase 3 Study CA209025, the safety profile of 
nivolumab in advanced RCC is manageable using routine risk minimisation measures and the 
recommendations as stated in the SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and 
the Package Leaflet and the descriptions and timelines of the ‘obligations to conduct post-authorisation 
measures’ in the Annex II have been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
make editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to update the contact details of the local 
representative in France in the Package Leaflet. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline 
and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], which were 
reviewed accepted by the CHMP. 
The full PI, as a relevant example with all changes highlighted is provided as an attachment. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Since the submitted type II variation to extend the current approved therapeutic indication for OPDIVO to 
include “treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after prior therapy in adults” does 
not involve a relevant impact on the PIL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Results of the predefined interim analysis from study CA209025 revealed a longer survival for patients 
treated with nivolumab vs everolimus (HR: 0.73 [98.52% CI: 0.57, 0.93]; stratified log-rank test p value = 
0.0018). The median of OS for nivolumab group was 25 months, whereas subjects treated with everolimus 
achieved a median of OS of 19.55 months. This gain in OS (5.45 months) is considered clinically meaningful. 
The survival rate at 1 year was higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (76.0% vs 66.7%). 
The Kaplan Meier curves were convincing, showing a clear separation between the two treatments.  
The gain in OS seems to be independent of PD-L1 expression and consistent across sensitivity analyses and 
adjusted analyses.  
Regarding the secondary endpoints, ORR was superior in the nivolumab group (25.1% vs 5.4%; 21.5% vs 
3.9% with a confirmatory scan after at least 4 weeks).

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No benefit in terms of PFS has been shown (HR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.75 to 1.03]). Reasons, when it comes to 
explaining this finding, are not totally clear. Treatment beyond progression, could have contributed to the 
observed discrepancy (non-conventional responders). The OS results are considered convincing and the lack 
of an effect on PFS does not have an impact on the robustness of the effect observed in terms of OS. 
Only patients pretreated with antiangiogenic therapy were included in the pivotal study. However, given the 
available data and current knowledge, there is no reason to suspect that the efficacy of nivolumab will be 
different in patients treated with other prior therapies. As such, restriction of the indication was not deemed 
necessary. The limitations of the patient population included in the main clinical study (pivotal study only 
includes patients with prior antiangiogenic) are mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Only patients with clear-cell histology were included in the pivotal study. The lack of clinical data for 
nivolumab in patients with non-clear cell RCC is mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 53.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 56.4% of subjects in the 
everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the only Grade 3-4 AE reported in ≥5% of subjects was anaemia 
(5.9%). 
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus 
group (78.6% vs 87.9%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (33.0%) was the only any-grade drug-related AE 
that occurred in ≥20% of subjects. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were also reported less frequently in the 
nivolumab group than the everolimus group (18.7% vs 36.5%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (2.5%) was 
the only Grade 3-4 drug-related AE that occurred in ≥2% of subjects. 
Any-grade SAEs were reported in 47.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 43.6% of subjects in the 
everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were 
malignant neoplasm progression (5.4%), pleural effusion (3.4%), pneumonia (2.7%), hypercalcaemia 
(2.5%), pneumonitis (2.0%), spinal cord compression (2.0%), and acute kidney injury (2.0%). 
Disease progression was the most common cause of death for both groups, including deaths occurring within 
30 days of last dose and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. In CA209025, there were fewer 
deaths in nivolumab group (44.6%, 181/406 subjects) compared with the everolimus group (53.7%, 
213/397 subjects) with the majority due to disease progression in both groups. No deaths were attributed to 
study drug toxicity with nivolumab

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Treatment with nivolumab in patients with RCC previously treated with antiangiogenic therapy has shown a 
longer survival than everolimus. This result is considered clinically meaningful. The uncertainties related to 
PFS do not decrease the value of the clinical benefit offered by nivolumab. From a safety point of view, the 
toxicity and tolerability of nivolumab was consistent with previously submitted pooled data of nivolumab 
monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC. No new safety concerns with nivolumab monotherapy treatment 
were identified in RCC. There were no deaths attributed to nivolumab during the study. Furthermore, 
comparative safety data from CA209025 demonstrate that nivolumab monotherapy has a acceptable safety

profile as compared to everolimus, as evidenced by the lower rates of drug-related AEs (all grades and Grade 
3-4) and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (all grades and Grade 3-4) in the nivolumab group. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit risk balance for nivolumab in the applied indication is positive.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (changes 
underlined): 
To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane 
level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and 
specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with 
measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be 
provided for all the approved indications: 
- Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066  
- RCC: studies CA209025 and CA209009 
To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression conducted in Study 
CA209066 and CA209025. 
Also, the CHMP recommended that the efficacy results, of study CA209374 (on-going), for the sub-group of 
patients with non-clear RCC should be submitted post approval.

the CA209010 addendum study report; phase 2 dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with 
progressive advanced/metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated, and the Package Leaflet and 
the descriptions and timelines of the ‘obligations to conduct post-authorisation measures’ in the Annex II 
have been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes in the 
SmPC and Package Leaflet and to update the contact details of the local representative in France in the 
Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 4.1 was agreed during the procedure.

Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is by consensus of the opinion that Opdivo is not similar to Nexavar and Torisel within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:  
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Due date 
4. The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab should be 
further explored, specifically: 
1.  To continue the exploration of the optimal cut-off for PD-L1 positivity 
based on current assay method used to further elucidate its value as 
predictive of nivolumab efficacy. These analyses will be conducted in 
studies CA209037 and CA209066 in patients with advanced 
melanoma. 
2.  To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 
expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other 
methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more 
sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on 
PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of 
CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab 
efficacy. This will be provided for all the approved indications: 
- Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066  
- NSCLC: studies CA209017, CA209057 and CA209026 
- RCC: studies CA209025 and CA209009 
3.  To further investigate the relation between PD-L1 and PD-L2 
expression in Phase 1 studies (CA209009, CA209038 and 
CA209064). 
4.  To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 expression conducted in studies CA209066, CA209057 and 
CA209025. 
5.  To further investigate the possible change in PD-L1 status of the 
tumour during treatment and/or tumour progression in studies 
CA209009, CA209038 and CA209064.

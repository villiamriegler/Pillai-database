1.  Background information on the procedure 
Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, metabolised by sphingosine kinase to the 
active metabolite fingolimod-phosphate.  
GILENYA (fingolimod) has been approved in Europe on 17 March 2011, through a centralised 
marketing authorization procedure in patients with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 
It is available as 0.5 mg oral hard capsules.  
GILENYA has been approved in USA in September 2010 and is marketed in that country since  
4 October 2010. 
At the time of the initial marketing authorisation a cardiovascular effect was identified (from preclinical 
and clinical data) and included as an important risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  
In addition a recommendation to monitor patients for signs and symptoms related to bradycardia for at 
least six hours after the first dose was already included in the medicine’s product information. 
On 12 December 2011, the MAH informed the EMA of the occurrence, in the USA, of one case of 
sudden and unexplained death within 24 hours after GILENYA first dose. At that time three additional 
cases of sudden/unexplained deaths were reported in the Eudravigilance database for this product 
(with time to onset from 15 days to 3 months).  
During the December 2011 meetings of PhVWP/CHMP a safety review of all cases of 
sudden/unexplained deaths and all cases of life threatening arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities 
with GILENYA was requested from the MAH. The MAH submitted the relevant data to the CHMP for 
further assessment on 21 December 2011. According to the requested safety review and the cases of 
cardiovascular disorders reported in the first European PSUR (covering the period from 1 March 2011 
to 31 August 2011), a cardiovascular direct effect of fingolimod was suspected, mainly regarding the 
occurrence of unexplained sudden death, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities 
(including atrioventricular (AV) blocks), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis). 
The CHMP in its January 2012 plenary meeting discussed the issue and are in agreement that further 
information is required.  
In view of the above the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. The European Commission requested the CHMP on 18 January 2012 to assess the 
above concerns and its impact on the benefit/risk for GILENYA, and to give its opinion on measures 
necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of GILENYA and on whether the marketing authorisation 
for this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn. 
Oral explanation was provided by the MAH on 17 January 2012 and on 14 March 2012. 
Additional information was provided by the MAH in writing on 10 January 2012. 
In addition, the MAH and the CHMP agreed the wording of a Dear Healthcare Professional 
Communication (DHPC) designed to inform prescribers of GILENYA . 
After reviewing all the available data submitted by the MAH to address the concerns discussed, the 
CHMP adopted an opinion 19 April 2012.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1. Introduction 
Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, metabolised by sphingosine kinase to the 
active metabolite fingolimod-phosphate.  
GILENYA (fingolimod) has been approved in Europe on 17 March 2011, through a centralised 
marketing authorization procedure in patients with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 
It is available as 0.5 mg oral hard capsules.  
At the time of the initial marketing authorisation a cardiovascular effect was identified (from preclinical 
and clinical data) and included as an important risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  
In addition a recommendation to monitor patients for signs and symptoms related to bradycardia for at 
least six hours after the first dose was already included in the medicine’s product information. 
During the December 2011 CHMP meeting a safety review of all cases of sudden/unexplained deaths 
and all cases of life threatening arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities with GILENYA was requested 
from the MAH. The MAH submitted the relevant data to the CHMP for further assessment on 
21 December 2011. According to the requested safety review and the cases of cardiovascular disorders 
reported in the first European PSUR (covering the period from 1 March 2011 to 31 August 2011), a 
cardiovascular direct effect of fingolimod was suspected, mainly regarding the occurrence of 
unexplained sudden death, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities (including 
atrioventricular (AV) blocks), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis). 
In view of the above the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. The European Commission requested the CHMP on 18 January 2012 to assess the 
above concerns and its impact on the benefit/risk for GILENYA, and to give its opinion on measures 
necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of GILENYA and on whether the marketing authorisation 
for this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn. 
The CHMP reviewed all data available from the clinical studies and post-marketing experience which 
are hereafter being discussed. 
2.2.  Clinical safety 
The MAH analysed and provided data on the cardiovascular disorders during the 24 hrs following the 
first dose. These data consisted of results of the clinical trials as well as post-marketing data.  
i. Cardiovascular disorders during 24 hours following first dose of fingolimod (FTY720) and 
patient monitoring during the first 24 hours after the first dose administration 
•  Data from clinical trials 
The following Table 1 provides data for patients that experienced cardiovascular disorders on day one 
and then again during the study (>2% in any treatment group) for all double-blind, randomised and 
controlled studies (D2201, D2301, D2302 and D2309 [Group D]). The percentage of patients with any 
cardiovascular disorder was comparable among the fingolimod and placebo groups. In the Interferon 
group only five patients had cardiovascular events on Day 1, but none of these patients had any 
cardiovascular event that occurred after Day 1.

The incidence of hypertension  was higher in patients in the fingolimod (FTY720) groups compared to 
placebo (11.2% FTY720 1.25 mg, 8.2% FTY720 0.5 mg, 5.6% Placebo), but this is consistent with the 
higher incidence of hypertension noted in the overall study population in patients treated with 
fingolimod compared to Placebo or Interferon. Three patients in the fingolimod treatment groups had 
1st degree atrioventricular (AV) block reported after Day 1 that were all mild in severity and did not 
require treatment. One of these patients had an adverse event of 1st degree AV block on Day 1, 1 
patient had bradycardia and the other patient had an adverse event of increased PR interval on Day 1. 
Increased blood pressure was reported as an adverse event (AE) in 6 patients (5 [5.6%] FTY720 1.25 
mg, 1 [2.0%] FTY720 0.5 mg, 0 placebo group). Three of the 6 patients with AEs of high blood 
pressure were treated with a drug or non-drug therapy, 4 cases were mild and 2 were moderate in 
severity. Heart palpitations were observed in a small number of patients and were comparable among 
the treatment groups. 
An analysis of the risk of a cardiovascular disorder after day 1 was conducted in patients who had a 
first dose finding as compared to those who did not have a first dose finding in the combined double-
blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of 2355 patients (see table 2 below):

Table 2:  Analysis of the risk of a cardiovascular disorder after 24 hours in patients who did 
or did not have a cardiovascular disorder on the day of the first dose 
In the above table, all cardiovascular disorder AEs with onset date on or after start of study drug to 45 
days after last dose of study drug and all cardiovascular disorder SAEs (irrespective of time after last 
dose of study drug) are included. 
- 
Preferred terms are sorted within primary system organ class by frequency from highest to 
lowest in FTY720 1.25 mg group. 
-  A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE for a preferred term or system organ class under 
one treatment is counted only once in each specific category for that treatment. 
In all treatment groups, the odds of a cardiovascular disorder after day 1 were significantly increased 
in patients who had a first dose finding as compared to those who did not have a finding. Considering 
the width of the confidence intervals, this increase was comparable in all three treatment groups. The 
odds were increased by a factor 1.66 [95%-CI: 0.78; 3.55] in the fingolimod 0.5 mg dose, and by a 
factor 1.50 [95%-CI: 0.48; 4.71] in placebo. There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect or 
an interaction; the increase in risk to experience a later cardiovascular disorder in patients who had a 
first-dose finding as compared to those who did not have a finding is comparable in patients treated 
with fingolimod 0.5 mg as in patients treated with placebo. 
In order to further explore this issue, spontaneous reports on Day 1 from the post-marketing 
experience were retrieved up to a data cutoff of 23 Jan 2012. Of the 13 cases that had cardiac adverse 
events both on Day 1 and at a later time, 12 were HCP reported and 1 was non HCP reported. The 
majority of these cases with Day 1 events from the post-marketing setting reflected the negative 
chronotropic effect previously seen in clinical trials, reported as heart rate decreased on Day 1. Four 
patients had alterations in their blood pressure without any evidence of clinical symptoms on Day 1. 
6 
 
 
 
One patient experienced second degree AV block on Day 2, consistent with the known effect on AV 
conduction. This event was later interpreted as atypical Wenckebach block. 
Of these 13 cases who had reported Day 1 events, some had a repeat similar cardiac adverse event 
(e.g. heart rate decreased, heart rate increased or heart rate findings like fluttering, premature 
ventricular contractions (PVC) or irregularity), most often in the first week or two of treatment. Other 
cases were confounded by concurrent illness at a later time point (e.g. severe diarrhea secondary to 
viral gastrointestinal illness, severe Multiple Sclerosis disability and autonomic instability). One fatality, 
due to an acute myocardial infarction on Day 32, had concurrent cardiac risk factors and autopsy 
findings of coronary atherosclerosis. She had experienced nadir heart rate (HR) of 47 on Day 1 without 
other problems. Overall, there was no pattern amongst the cases suggesting pre-existing risk factors 
that would predict cardiac adverse events at later time points. In addition, based on the available 
information, the later events, apart from the fatal MI, did not appear to be clinically significant or 
require intervention.  
With respect to the management of potential serious cardiovascular disorders which may occur during 
the 24 hours following the first fingolimod dose, the recommendation in clinical trials was that atropine 
(SC or IV) be used, if necessary, as the first-line treatment of bradycardia, up to a maximum daily 
dose of 3 mg. However, most of the bradyarrhythmias in clinical trials have been either asymptomatic 
or associated with only minor symptoms which did not require pharmacological intervention. There 
have, however, been rare episodes of symptomatic bradycardia, including several episodes of syncope. 
The most severe episodes have been temporally associated with vagal stimuli such as nausea, blood 
drawing, or vomiting. This raises the possibility of an interaction between autonomic nervous system 
dysfunction with vagal hyperactivity and fingolimod in susceptible individuals. 
•  Monitoring during 24 hours following administration of the first dose 
Holter hourly heart rate  
A total of 1080 patients from study D2309 were included in the Holter ECG analysis set. The changes 
in hourly mean heart rate on the first day of treatment compared to the same daily hours at the 
screening Holter ECG (i.e. adjusting by circadian rhythm) are shown graphically in figure 1. 
7 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1:  Change in Holter hourly mean heart rate (bpm) from screening to Day 1 by post-
dose 24-hour clock (Study D2309) 
A similar decline in hourly mean heart rate was observed in the FTY720 and placebo groups in the first 
2 hours post-dose on day 1. Thereafter, the change in hourly mean heart rate from screening to day 1 
continued to decrease in both FTY720 groups reaching maximal mean decreases at 6 hours post-dose 
of 25.2 bpm for FTY720 1.25 mg and 20.5 bpm for FTY720 0.5 mg. This effect attenuated (i.e. heart 
rate increased) over the following 18 hours. At 24 hours post-dose, the mean decrease from screening 
in hourly mean heart rate was reduced to 9.3 bpm in the FTY720 1.25 mg group and 6.9 bpm in the 
FTY720 0.5 mg group.  
Patients in the placebo group, exhibited an initial decline in hourly mean heart rate in the first 2 hours 
post-dose on day 1 versus screening to a maximal mean decrease of 10.7 bpm at 2 hours, followed by 
a gradual increase in heart rate returning close to baseline values by 10 hours post-dose and 
remaining at that level for the rest of the 24-hour monitoring period.  
In the following table the results of monitoring of patients during the phase III placebo-controlled 
(D2309) as well from all studies are presented. It is shown that the majority of the treated patients 
were discharged at 6 hours following the first dose administration.

The CHMP recommendation for the first-dose monitoring is that all patients should have an ECG and 
blood pressure measurement performed prior to the first dose of fingolimod.  All patients should be 
monitored for a period of 6 hours for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly heart rate and 
blood pressure measurement. Continuous (real time) ECG monitoring during this 6 hour period is also 
recommended by the CHMP.  
•  Post-marketing data 
With respect to second- and third-degree atrioventricular block in the post-marketing setting, as of 
12 December 2011 (data cutoff date), a total of 25 events (in 24 patients) including 5 events of 3rd-
degree atrioventricular block (4 were not confirmed on review of the ECGs, 1 case confirmed), 17 
events of 2nd-degree atrioventricular block (2 type II, 9 type I, one 2:1, one 3:1 and 4 with type 
unspecified) and 3 events of atrioventricular block – type unspecified were reported. All 25 events 
occurred within 6 hours of receiving the first dose of fingolimod. Two patients had taken a calcium 
channel blocker and/or a beta blocker as concomitant medications (one experienced 2nd-degree AV 
block, the other one experienced AV block-type unspecified, both events were asymptomatic and 
resolved without any treatment). Three patients received atropine for bradycardia (two were 
symptomatic, all events resolved). Outcome of the events included complete recovery in the majority 
of cases (24) with one case where outcome was not reported (1, event: AV block-unspecified).  
The only significant bradyarrhythmic event that has been reported during Day 1 after the 6- hour 
observation is the case of transient asystole occurring 21 hours post-dose initiation. The history and 
ECG findings could suggest a vagal stimulus as contributing to the event, which spontaneously 
reversed.  
The patient who died 24 hours after the first dose remains without a specific diagnosis, although it is 
recognised that the patient had potential risk factors for cardiac adverse events including hypertension 
and concomitant use of a beta blocker and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker medication.  
In terms of other potential bradyarrhythmias, although several have been noted with fingolimod, they 
have also been equally common in the control groups and not limited in either fingolimod or control 
groups to Day 1.  
Conclusions on monitoring after first dose administration 
During clinical studies (Group D, all double blind randomised and controlled studies), proportion of 
patients with a cardiovascular disorder on day 1 who also experienced another cardiovascular disorder 
after day 1 was respectively of 28.6%, 28.1, 22.4, 22.2 and 0 in the fingolimod 5 mg, 1.25 mg, 0.5 
mg, placebo and interferon groups. On the basis of the statistical analysis regarding the risk of a 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cardiovascular disorder after day 1 in patients with cardiovascular disorder at day 1 compared to 
patients without a cardiovascular disorder at day 1, no clear conclusion could be drawn. However, the 
number of patients with cardiovascular disorders at day 1 was low.  
The MAH also provided post-marketing data. Thirteen fatal cases have been retrieved by the MAH, with 
a cardiovascular disorder on day 1 and a cardiovascular disorder after day one. The thirteen cases 
retrieved by the MAH occurred in 9 female patients and 4 male patients, with a mean age of 44 years 
(extremes 26 -61). Most of the deaths and cardiovascular problems had occurred in patients with a 
history of cardiovascular problems and/or taking other medicines. In 9 cases, a decrease in heart rate 
was reported at day 1 (with blood pressure increase in 1 case, and blood pressure decrease in 2 
cases). In 2 of those 9 cases, a heart rate decrease was also reported, respectively after 14 days of 
treatment (with a reported heart rate of 32 bpm) and after 84 days of treatment (with a reported heart 
rate of 30 bpm, and an associated blood pressure decrease). The third case reported syncope and loss 
of consciousness at day 8. The fourth case of heart rate decreased at day 1 reported fatal myocardial 
infarction at day 32. Of the 5 remaining cases of heart rate decrease at day 1, one reported an 
irregular heart rated at day 5, and 4 blood pressure disorders (fluctuation in one case, increase in 2 
cases, and decrease in one case). Additional two fatal cases of patients with cardiovascular adverse 
events were also reported thereafter, making the total cases to 15. Although the cause of these latest 
events is still not known, these patients were treated with Gilenya and additionally had known 
cardiovascular problems.   
No clear pattern emerged from the post-marketing cases reported and no definite conclusion can be 
drawn on the basis of those cases.  
Based on evaluation of these data, the incidence of overall blocks is low (~ 1 per 1000) with a small 
number of high degree atrioventricular blocks (e.g. Mobitz Type II 2nd-degree AV block, complete 
heart block) reported. The nature of the events (e.g. onset time, course and outcome) is consistent 
with previous cumulative experience on 1st-dose cardiac adverse events with fingolimod. Clinical trial 
and post-marketing data provided do not allow concluding on a potential predictive effect of first dose 
related cardiovascular disorders for delayed cardiovascular disorders.  
However, health care professionals should be better informed, with in particular, mention in section 4.4 
of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) that negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod, 
observed during hours following first intake, can be reversed if necessary, by parenteral atropine or 
isoprenaline (as it is already mentioned in section 5.1 of the currently approved SmPC).  
The occurrence of 3rd-degree AV block with the approved dose of 0.5 mg is newly observed 
(previously only reported with 1.25mg) and the CHMP proposes its inclusion in the product information 
and in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Following the assessment of the above data and in order to further strengthen procedures to enhance 
patient safety the CHMP recommended changes in the SmPC to include the safety information on 
cardiovascular concerns in the relevant sections. More specifically the CHMP recommended that a 
continuous 6 hour monitoring using electrocardiography (ECG) after administration of the first dose 
needs to be in place during the first dose monitoring. The first dose monitoring procedure is 
recommended for every patient who is initiated with fingolimod or re-initiated after an interval of at 
least 15 days. In addition if there are any concerns the monitoring may need to be extended until the 
symptoms cease to exist.

ii. Cardiovascular disorders during medication and in at risk patients 
Data from Clinical studies 
•  Study D2316 
The cardiovascular (CV) profile of fingolimod in patients with relapsing-remitting MS has been 
investigated in the clinical Phase II and III program. The Phase IIIb study D2316, a 4-month, open-
label, single-arm study of fingolimod in patients with relapsing MS, included a broader population of 
patients than previously exposed to fingolimod in clinical trials: upper age limit of 65 years; and 
controlled diabetes, chronic asthma, and certain protocol-defined cardiac risk factors.  
This study included a total of 2417 patients of whom a subgroup of 295 patients met protocol-defined 
criteria for coexistent cardiovascular risk factors at baseline (baseline heart rate of 45-54 bpm (<45 
bpm was exclusion criterion), second-degree AV-block (Mobitz I), history of recurrent symptomatic 
bradycardia, concomitant treatment with beta blockers).  
After assessing the submitted data from the study D2316, only 295 patients were considered to be at 
cardiac risk, defined as either bradycardia at rest (heart rate 45-54), history of symptomatic 
bradycardia, of second-degree AV block, vasovagal syncope or co-medication with beta-blockers 
and/or calcium channel blockers. Only 26 patients had diabetes, and 80 were older than 56 years. The 
overall population was therefore at a low cardiovascular risk.  
During the study, the incidence of cardiac disorders was not clearly higher in patients with cardiac risk 
(5.1%) than in the other patients (4.1%). The incidence of cardiac disorders during the first 2 days 
following fingolimod first administration was 2.4% in the cardiac risk group, and 2.0% in the rest of 
the population. Bradycardia was the most common cardiac adverse effect (1.4% in the patients with 
cardiac risk factors versus 0.5% in patients without risk factors), with palpitations (0 in patients with 
risk factors versus 0.7% in patients without risk factors). There were 6 reports of AV block, all in the 
population without cardiac risk factors. 
The incidence of cardiac disorders (mostly bradycardia) was 9% in patients with beta blockers and/or 
calcium channel blockers versus 3.9% in patients without. And at day 1 and/or 2, those incidences 
were respectively of 6.1% versus 1.9%.  
Results in patients monitored on-site (whether at cardiac risk or not), are in favour of a clear 
bradycardic effect of fingolimod: while heart rate <45 was observed in only 3 patients before first dose 
on day 1, it was observed in 16 patients during the 6 post-dose hours. Similarly, heart rate 45-55 was 
observed in 56 patients pre-dose, and in 179 after first dose. 
Regarding Holter monitoring, overall, more cardiac disorders were recorded during screening than 
during day 1, after fingolimod first dose. The only exceptions were Mobitz 1 2nd degree AV block in 
patients without cardiac risk factors (2 cases screening, 22 post-dose), and 2:1 AV block, both in 
patients with and without cardiac risk factors. Although patients with cardiac risk factors had obviously 
more cardiac disorders at screening, the increase in AV block or bradycardia was not more common in 
these patients.  
Of note, two female patients, aged respectively 30 years old and 49 years old, presented angina 
pectoris during the study, with as only reported symptoms: pain extending to left arm in one case, and 
cardiac chest pain in the second case.  
Given the limited data regarding patients with cardiac risk factors and in the absence of a comparator, 
no conclusion can be drawn up to date on the basis of this study. However, patients concomitantly 
receiving beta blockers and calcium channel blockers seem to be at increased risk of cardiac disorders.

•  Other clinical trial data 
The analysis of clinical trial data for CV adverse events in patients with and without CV disease/risk 
factors was based on the following groupings: 
Group D: All patients in double-blind, randomised and controlled studies: D2201 (6- month vs. 
placebo, D2301 (24 months vs. placebo), D2302 (12-month vs. interferon (IFN) beta-1a), D2309 (24 
months vs. placebo). 
Extended Group E (fingolimod treated safety population): All fingolimod treated patients in either 
double-blind, randomised and placebo- or active- controlled studies (D2201, D2301, D2302 and 
D2309) or in their extension phases (D2201E1, D2301E1, D2302E1 and D2309E1). Data from the 
ongoing extension study D2309E1 are included with a cut-off date of 31 March 2011. 
CV adverse events were summarised for the overall populations in Group D and Extended Group E and 
for subgroups of patients with and without medical history of CV disease and/or risk factors. Events 
with onset on Day 1 (within 24 hours of first dose) and events with onset after Day 1 (at any time) 
were summarised separately. 
The number of CV adverse events reported on Day 1 was small overall, compared to the placebo and 
IFN beta-1a groups (1.2-1.5%). Based on the known effect of fingolimod on heart rate and conduction 
upon treatment initiation, bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) blocks (1st and 2nd degree) were the 
most frequently reported events in the fingolimod groups on Day 1. 
When analysing the data from the groups of patients with and without cardiovascular diseases and/or 
risk factors, the largest subgroup was the one in which patients did not have any CV disease or a risk 
factor reported in their medical history. Higher rates of CV adverse events were reported in the 
subgroups of patients with a medical history of CV disease/risk factors compared to those without. This 
was seen in the fingolimod groups as well as in the placebo group.  
As expected, higher numbers of patients with CV adverse events were reported in the fingolimod 
groups, with evidence of a dose-effect, compared to the control groups. This was seen in all subgroup 
analyses, although interpretation of the results for some of the subgroups is difficult due to  the very 
small number of cases reported..  
Following the CHMP request, the MAH provided listings with details, by preferred term of cardiovascular 
diseases and risk factors identified. 
For group D patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease were mostly patients with 
hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidaemia and obesity. No increase incidence of cardiac disorders has 
been observed in those patients compared to patients without cardiovascular diseases or risk factors. 
Patients with cardiovascular diseases at baseline, included in FTY720 1.25 mg, 0.5 mg and placebo 
groups experienced a higher incidence of cardiac disorders compared to patients without 
cardiovascular diseases and without risk factors. It should be noted that those patients with 
cardiovascular diseases at baseline were mostly patients with valve disorders and controlled 
hypertension. 
In the Extended Group E population, the proportion of patients with CV adverse events with onset on 
Day 1 was consistent with what was seen for Group D for fingolimod treated patients. Findings in 
subgroups of patients with and without cardiovascular diseases and/or risk factors were consistent with 
those reported for fingolimod treated patients in Group D. 
The proportion of cardiovascular adverse events with onset after day 1 was similar across the 
fingolimod (13.8-17.4%) and placebo groups (16.5%) and slightly lower in the interferon beta group 
(9.5%). In the SOCs Cardiac disorders and Investigations, events were reported at similar frequencies 
12 
 
in the fingolimod and placebo groups. In the Vascular disorders SOC, more events were reported in the 
fingolimod groups compared to the control groups. This was mainly driven by the higher frequency of 
reports of hypertension in the fingolimod groups (6.4-7.8% vs. 2.1-3.2% in the control groups). 
Except for patients with CV disease and risk factors, the overall number of CV adverse events reported 
after Day 1 in the subgroups was not higher in the fingolimod groups compared to the placebo group. 
A higher rate of hypertension in patients on fingolimod vs. placebo was observed. 
For patients with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors (i.e. mostly with hypercholesterolemia, 
hyperlipidemia and obesity), a higher incidence of cardiovascular adverse events as defined above (32-
44% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg vs. 19.5% for placebo), and in particular of hypertension has 
been observed, for all groups of patients, included patients in the placebo and Interferon groups.  
•  Post-marketing experience for patients with CV disease or risk factors 
In the post-marketing setting, a search of the MAH’s safety database (data cutoff: 23 Jan 2012) was 
conducted using the same search criteria as used for clinical trial cases above using MedDRA version 
14.1. The search retrieved a total of 185 cases with CV disease/other risk factors that experienced 
cardiovascular adverse events while being treated with fingolimod. 
Data on the CV adverse events and time of onset after starting therapy that occurred in patients who 
had history of CV disease / risk factors is provided in Table 4 below.

The majority of the CV adverse events experienced by patients who had a history of CV disease/other 
risk factors were the typical events associated with fingolimod, i.e. bradycardia, AV blocks and 
hypertension. Regarding the time of onset, 60% of events with known onset begin on Day 1 with only 
approximately 20% starting after Month 1. 
Bradycardia and AV block events account for approximately 45% of all events and 87% of those with 
known onset date occurred on Day 1. Hypertension was reported in 25% of patients. Of late-occurring 
events hypertension represented 40% of the cases. 
Of the 96 patients who experienced cardiovascular adverse events on Day 1 of initial fingolimod intake, 
the events that could be considered more severe included 3 complete AV blocks, 2 second-degree AV 
blocks (Mobitz II) and 1 myocardial infarction with a favourable outcome. 
Of the 89 patients who experienced cardiovascular adverse events after Day 1 of initial fingolimod 
intake, the events that could be considered more severe included 5 myocardial infarctions (2 were fatal 
and 1 case of atrial fibrillation. There was also a case of fatal hypertensive cardiovascular disease. 
Conclusions on cardiovascular adverse events in at risk patients 
Based on current clinical and post-marketing data no clear increase of cardiovascular disorders under 
fingolimod in patients with cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors can be defined at Day 1 and after 
Day 1, except for “hypertension”. However, data analyses were based on limited number of patients, 
and baseline cardiovascular diseases and risk factors identified by the MAH mainly included patients 
with hypertension, cardiac valve disorders, hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity.  
No clear data were available for patients who were excluded from participating to clinical studies. 
The CHMP therefore recommended the amendments to the SmPC and especially section 4.4 “Warnings 
and precautions of use” in order to include the information on patients with pre-existing CV adverse 
events as well on “hypertension”. 
Due to the risk of serious rhythm disturbances, the CHMP agreed that Gilenya should not be used in 
patients at risk. These patients may be with second degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-
sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block, in patients with a history of symptomatic bradycardia or 
recurrent syncope, or patients with significant QT prolongation (QTc>470msec (female) or >450msec 
(male)).  
In addition since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with known ischaemic 
heart disease (including angina pectoris), cerebrovascular disease, history of myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, uncontrolled hypertension or severe untreated sleep 
apnoea, then the medicinal product should not be used in these patients. Furthermore, if treatment is 
considered in such patients, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment 
in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring (at least overnight) for treatment initiation. 
14 
 
 
 
The CHMP also recommended that clear communications to practitioners regarding these risks, 
including recommendations regarding cardiology consultation and closer observation during initial 
dosing, including overnight observation if necessary, will enhance patient safety.  
iii. Concomitant use of fingolimod with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers 
The MAH submitted data on current clinical pharmacology, clinical and post-marketing data in 
combination with heart rate lowering drugs or QT prolonging drugs.  
•  Atenolol 
Study A0114 was a cross-over designed study in which healthy volunteers (n=14) received fingolimod 
5 mg single dose or atenolol 50 mg daily for four days or both treatments together. 
Fingolimod versus atenolol. The mean heart rate nadir was significantly lower by 8% for fingolimod 
compared with atenolol (p = 0.03), but the fingolimod/atenolol ratio and 90% confidence interval 
remained in the equivalence bounds: 0.92 (0.86-0.98).  
None of the other cardiovascular responses were different between treatments with fingolimod/atenolol 
ratios for heart rate AUEC(0-12) of 0.97 (0.92-1.03); for mean arterial pressure nadir of 1.02 (1.00-
1.04); and for mean arterial pressure AUEC(0-12) of 1.02 (1.00-1.04). 
Fingolimod versus fingolimod + atenolol. Fingolimod 5 mg + atenolol decreased heart rate responses 
by 15% and mean arterial pressure responses by 7-8% compared with fingolimod 5 mg alone.  
With one minor exception, however, all ratios and 90% confidence interval remained in the standard 
equivalence bounds as follows: heart rate nadir 0.85 (0.79-0.92); heart rate AUEC(0-12) 0.85 (0.81-
0.89); mean arterial pressure nadir 0.93 (0.91-0.96); and mean arterial pressure AUEC(0-12) 0.92 
(0.90-0.95).  
Although the heart rate and mean arterial pressure trajectories were shifted downward on the 
measurement scale after fingolimod 5 mg + atenolol, they retained their normal circadian patterns. 
•  Diltiazem 
Study A0114 was a cross-over designed in which study healthy volunteers (n=14) received fingolimod 
5 mg single dose or diltiazem extended release 240 mg daily for four days or both treatments 
together.  
Fingolimod 5 mg versus diltiazem. The mean heart rate nadir and the AUEC(0-12) were significantly 
lower by 18% and 13% for fingolimod compared with diltiazem (p <0.001). The corresponding 
fingolimod/diltiazem ratios and the 90% confidence intervals were: 0.82 (0.78-0.85) and 0.87 (0.84-
0.90). Mean arterial pressure nadir and AUEC(0-12) were similar between treatments: 1.00 (0.97-1.04) 
and 0.98 (0.96-1.01). 
Fingolimod 5 mg versus fingolimod 5 mg + diltiazem. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure responses 
were not different from fingolimod 5 mg alone compared with fingolimod 5 mg + diltiazem. The ratios 
and 90% confidence intervals were 0.99 (0.94-1.05) for heart rate nadir, 0.98 (0.95-1.00) for heart 
rate AUEC(0-12), 1.00 (0.96-1.03) for mean arterial pressure nadir, and 0.98 (0.96-1.01) for mean 
arterial pressure AUEC(0-12). The heart rate trajectory after fingolimod + diltiazem retained a normal 
circadian pattern. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered the data submitted by the MAH and concluded that fingolimod enhances heart 
rate decrease due to atenolol, as seen when either comparing atenolol vs fingolimod (HR lower than 
8% with the latter) or adding atenolol to fingolimod (the combination decreases HR by 15%, 
comparatively to 7 to 8% with fingolimod). 
The heart rate trajectory and mean arterial pressure were shifted downward, despite normal circadian 
rhythms. So the lack of clinically relevant interaction with beta-blockers cannot be agreed on, whereas 
there is an additive effect on HR of 15%, when comparing fingolimod alone to fingolimod plus atenolol. 
The negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod alone is 7-8% stronger than that of atenolol alone. Even 
if it did not translate into noticeable events in healthy volunteers, this additive effect, although not 
systematic as shown by the lack of outliers, may give raise to isolated/unexpected/undesirable events 
in the clinical setting, occurring later than the 6 hours-period after dosing, and notably during the late-
night bradycardia.   
It is noted that the effect of diltiazem on heart rate is minor, compared to that of atenolol. However, 
given the strong depressor cardiac propertiesof calcium channel blocker, starting fingolimod in patients 
who take calcium channel blockers is not recommended. 
Conclusions on agents inducing bradycardia 
Considering that the bradycardia-inducing effect of atenolol is similar to that of fingolimod, the current 
warning needs to be reinforced.  Knowing that beta-blocking treatment cannot be abruptly interrupted 
and impairs/prevents compensative adrenergic reactions in case of AV block or collapse, considering 
also that night-late bradycardia is a unpredictable, obvious additional risk, bradycardia-inducing drugs, 
including anticholinesteratics, should be avoided in patients starting fingolimod treatment. If the 
combination is deemed necessary, advice from a cardiologist should be sought and at least overnight 
monitoring should be recommended.  
Considering that beta-blockers cannot be abruptly interrupted, the potentiating of beta-blockers by 
fingolimod in healthy volunteers, the subsequent loss of sympathetic compensative reactions in case of 
abrupt bradycardia, the circadian reduction in heart rate at night, these elements require a 
reinforcement of the warning in the SmPC.  
For that the CHMP recommended that the section 4.4, “Special warnings and precautions for use” and 
section 4.5 “Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction “of the SmPC be 
revised to include the information on agents inducing bradycardia as experience with fingolimod is 
limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with beta blockers, heart rate lowering calcium channel 
blockers (such as diltiazem), or other substances which may decrease heart.  
Moreover, since the initiation of treatment is also associated with slowing of the heart rate, 
concomitant use of these substances during treatment initiation may be associated with severe 
bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart rate treatment should 
not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with these substances. The CHMP 
recommended that if treatment is considered in such patients, advice from a cardiologist should be 
sought regarding the switch to non heart-rate lowering medicinal products or appropriate monitoring 
for treatment initiation (at least overnight) if the heart-rate-lowering medication cannot be stopped. 
v. Hypertension 
In multiple sclerosis clinical studies 0.5 mg fingolimod was associated with an average increase of 
approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure and approximately 1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, 
manifesting approximately 1 month after treatment initiation. This increase persisted with continued 
16 
 
 
 
treatment. Hypertension was reported in 6.1% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.8% of 
patients on placebo. Onset of hypertension can occur within 1 month of treatment and hypertension as 
an adverse event has been reported on the day of treatment initiation.  
Taking into account this information as well as the recent post-marketing observations (see table 4 
above) the CHMP recommended that treatment with fingolimod should not be initiated in patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension until this is brought under control. 
Conclusions on Safety 
The MAH provided safety data from clinical studies. During these studies (double blind randomised and 
controlled studies, D2201, D2301, D2302 and D2309 [Group D]), the proportion of patients with a 
cardiovascular disorder on day one who also experienced another cardiovascular disorder after day one 
was respectively of 28.6%, 28.1, 22.4, 22.2 and 0 in the fingolimod 5 mg, 1.25 mg, 0.5 mg, placebo 
and interferon groups. On the basis of the statistical analysis regarding the risk of a cardiovascular 
disorder after day one in patients with cardiovascular disorder at day one compared to patients without 
a cardiovascular disorder at day one, no clear conclusion could be drawn. However, the number of 
patients with cardiovascular disorders at day one was low but still more than 2% in any treatment 
group.  
This safety review of Gilenya was initiated following receipt of a spontaneous report of a 59 year-old 
female patient with multiple sclerosis who died within 24 hours of taking the first dose of Gilenya and 
was also treated for hypertension. So, the MAH provided post-marketing data on all cardiovascular 
adverse events received. Thirteen fatal cases have been retrieved by the MAH, with a cardiovascular 
disorder on day one and a cardiovascular disorder after day one. The thirteen cases retrieved by the 
MAH occurred in 9 female patients and 4 male patients, with a mean age of 44 years. In 9 cases, a 
decrease in heart rate was reported at day one (with blood pressure increase in 1 case, and blood 
pressure decrease in 2 cases). In 2 of those 9 cases, a heart rate decrease was also reported, 
respectively after 14 days of treatment (with a reported heart rate of 32 bpm) and after 84 days of 
treatment (with a reported heart rate of 30 bpm, and an associated blood pressure decrease). One 
third case, reported syncope and loss of consciousness at day 8. A fourth case of heart rate decreased 
at day one reported fatal myocardial infarction at day 32. Of the 5 remaining cases of heart rate 
decrease at day one, one reported an irregular heart rated at day 5, and 4 blood pressure disorders 
(fluctuation in one case, increase in 2 cases, and decrease in one case). Additional two fatal cases of 
patients with cardiovascular adverse events were also reported there after, making the total cases to 
15. Although the cause of these latest events is still not known, these patients were treated with 
Gilenya and additionally had known cardiovascular problems.   
It is acknowledged that initiation of fingolimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate 
and may also be associated with atrioventricular conduction delays, including the occurrence of 
isolated reports of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block, as this information was 
already in the product information of Gilenya since the initial marketing authorisation. 
On the basis of the available data the CHMP agreed that after the first dose, the decline in heart rate 
starts within one hour and is steepest within 6 hours. The negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod 
persists beyond 6 hours and progressively attenuates over subsequent days of treatment. With 
continued administration, heart rate returns to baseline within one month. Conduction abnormalities 
were typically transient and asymptomatic. They usually did not require treatment and resolved within 
the first 24 hours on treatment. The CHMP recommended that should post-dose bradyarrhythmia-
related symptoms occur, appropriate clinical management should be initiated and monitoring should be 
continued until the symptoms have resolved. Should a patient require pharmacologic intervention 
17 
 
 
 
during the first-dose observation, at least overnight monitoring in a medical facility should be 
instituted.  
In addition, the CHMP concluded that since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients 
with known ischaemic heart disease (including angina pectoris), cerebrovascular disease, history of 
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, uncontrolled hypertension or 
severe sleep apnoea, the medicinal product should not be used in these patients. Furthermore, if 
treatment is considered in such patients, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation 
of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring (at least overnight) for treatment 
initiation. 
Considering that the bradycardia-inducing effect of beta-blockers is similar to that of fingolimod, the 
CHMP recommended that the current warning in the product information needs to be reinforced.  
Knowing that beta-blocking treatment cannot be abruptly interrupted and impairs/prevents 
compensative adrenergic reactions in case of AV block or collapse, considering also that night-late 
bradycardia is unpredictable, bradycardia-inducing drugs, including anticholinesteratics, should be 
avoided in patients starting on fingolimod. If the treatment combination is deemed necessary, an 
extended monitoring, at least overnight, should be recommended. For that the CHMP recommended 
that the section 4.4, “Special warnings and precautions for use” and section 4.5 “Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of interaction“ of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
be revised to include the information on agents inducing bradycardia as eexperience with fingolimod is 
limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with beta blockers, heart rate lowering calcium channel 
blockers (such as diltiazem), or other substances which may decrease heart rate.  
Moreover, since the initiation of treatment is also associated with slowing of the heart rate, 
concomitant use of these substances during treatment initiation may be associated with severe 
bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart rate treatment should 
not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with these substances. The CHMP 
recommended that if treatment is considered in such patients, advice from a cardiologist should be 
sought regarding the switch to non heart-rate lowering medicinal products or appropriate monitoring 
for treatment initiation (at least overnight) if the heart-rate-lowering medication cannot be stopped. 
The CHMP also assessed the incidents of hypertension in multiple sclerosis clinical studies. The 0.5 mg 
dose of fingolimod was associated with an average increase of approximately 3 mmHg in systolic 
pressure and approximately 1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, manifesting approximately 1 month after 
treatment initiation. This increase persisted with continued treatment. Hypertension was reported in 
6.1% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.8% of patients on placebo. Onset of hypertension can 
occur within 1 month of treatment and hypertension as an adverse event has been reported on the day 
of treatment initiation.  
Taking into account this information as well as the recent post-marketing observations the CHMP 
recommended that treatment with fingolimod should not be initiated in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension until this is brought under control. 
Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this procedure which included a risk 
minimisation plan. The summary of the risk management plan is in the table 5 below. The changes 
made following this article 20 review procedure are presented in grey shading. In addition the MAH will 
submit an updated RMP by the end of April 2012 together with the scheduled PSUR submission.

Targeted follow-up of all serious 
spontaneous reports using a 
targeted cardiac rate and rhythm 
disorders checklist (including first 
dose observation) 
Risk addressed in SmPC sections 
4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8 state 
that initiation of fingolimod 
treatment results in a transient 
decrease in heart rate and may also 
be associated with atrioventricular 
conduction delays, including the 
occurrence of isolated reports of 
transient, spontaneously resolving 
complete AV block. After the first 
dose, the decline in heart rate starts 
within one hour and is steepest 
within 6 hours. The negative 
chronotropic effect of Gilenya 
persists beyond 6 hours and 
progressively attenuates over 
subsequent days of treatment. With 
continued administration, heart rate 
returns to baseline within one 
month. Conduction abnormalities 
were typically transient and 
asymptomatic. They usually did not 
require treatment and resolved 
within the first 24 hours on 
treatment. If necessary, the 
decrease in heart rate induced by 
fingolimod can be reversed by 
parenteral doses of atropine or 
isoprenaline 
All patients should have an ECG 
and blood pressure measurement 
performed prior to and 6 hours after 
the first dose of Gilenya.  All 
patients should be monitored for a 
period of 6 hours for signs and 
symptoms of bradycardia with 
hourly heart rate and blood pressure 
measurement. Continuous real time 
ECG monitoring during this 6 hour 
period is recommended.  
Should post-dose bradyarrhythmia-
related symptoms occur, 
appropriate clinical management 
should be initiated and monitoring 
should be continued until the 
symptoms have resolved. Should a

If the heart rate at 6 hours is the 
lowest since the first dose was 
administered (suggesting that the 
maximum pharmacodynamic effect 
on the heart may not yet be 
manifest), monitoring should be 
extended by at least 2 hours and 
until heart rate increases again. 
Additionally, if after 6 hours, the 
heart rate is <45 bpm, or the ECG 
shows new onset second degree or 
higher grade AV block or a QTc 
interval ≥500 msec, extended 
monitoring (at least overnight 
monitoring), should be performed, 
and until the findings have 
resolved. The occurrence at any 
time of third degree AV block 
should also lead to extended 
monitoring (at least overnight 
monitoring). 
Due to the risk of serious rhythm 
disturbances, Gilenya should not be 
used in patients with second degree 
Mobitz type II or higher AV block, 
sick-sinus syndrome, sino-atrial 
heart block, a history of 
symptomatic bradycardia or 
recurrent syncope, or in patients 
with significant QT prolongation 
(QTc >470 msec (females) or >450 
msec (males)). Since significant 
bradycardia may be poorly 
tolerated in patients with known 
ischaemic heart disease, (including 
angina pectoris), cerebrovascular 
disease, history of myocardial 
infarction, congestive heart failure, 
history of cardiac arrest, 
uncontrolled hypertension, or 
severe untreated sleep apnoea, 
Gilenya should not be used in these 
patients. In such patients, treatment 
with Gilenya should be considered 
only if the anticipated benefits 
outweigh the potential risks. If 
treatment is considered, advice 
from a cardiologist should be 
sought prior to initiation of 
treatment in order to determine the 
most appropriate monitoring, at 
least overnight extended 
monitoring is recommended for 
treatment initiation

Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) 
antiarrhythmic medicinal products. 
Class Ia and Class III 
antiarrhythmic medicinal products 
have been associated with cases of 
torsades depointes in patients with 
bradycardia. Since initiation of 
Gilenya treatment results in 
decreased heart rate, Gilenya 
should not be used concomitantly 
with these medicinal products.  
Experience with Gilenya is limited 
in patients receiving concurrent 
therapy with beta blockers, heart 
rate lowering calcium channel 
blockers (such as verapamil, 
diltiazem or ivabradine), or other 
substances which may decrease 
heart rate (e.g. digoxin, 
anticholinesteratic agents or 
pilocarpine). Since the initiation of 
Gilenya treatment is also associated 
with slowing of the heart rate (see 
“Bradyarrhythmia”), concomitant 
use of these substances during 
Gilenya initiation may be 
associated with severe bradycardia 
and heart block. Because of the 
potential additive effect on heart 
rate, treatment with Gilenya should 
not be initiated in patients who are 
concurrently treated with these 
substances. In such patients, 
treatment with Gilenya should be 
considered only if the anticipated 
benefits outweigh the potential 
risks.  If treatment with Gilenya is 
considered, advice from a 
cardiologist should be sought 
regarding the switch to non heart-
rate lowering medicinal products 
prior to initiation of treatment. If 
the heart-rate-lowering medication 
cannot be stopped, cardiologist’s 
advice should be sought to 
determine appropriate first dose 
monitoring, at least overnight 
extended monitoring is 
recommended. 
SmPC also states that if Gilenya 
therapy is discontinued for more 
than 2 weeks, the effects on heart 
rate and atrio-ventricular 
conduction may recur on 
reintroduction of Gilenya treatment 
and the same precautions as for 
treatment initiation should apply.

treated with Gilenya. 
In MS clinical trials, patients 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg had 
an average increase of 
approximately 3 mmHg in systolic 
pressure, and approximately 
1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, first 
detected approximately 1 month 
after treatment initiation, and 
persisting with continued treatment. 
In the two-year placebo-controlled 
study, hypertension was reported as 
an adverse event in 6.1% of 
patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and 
in 3.8% of patients on placebo. In 
the post-marketing setting, cases of 
hypertension have been reported 
within the first month of treatment 
initiation and on the first day of 
treatment, that may require 
treatment with antihypertensive 
agents or discontinuation of 
Gilenya   
Risk addressed in SmPC sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
SmPc states that during clinical 
trials, elevations 3-fold the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) or greater in 
liver transaminases occurred in 8% 
of patients treated with fingolimod 
0.5 mg compared to 2% of placebo 
patients. Elevations 5-fold the ULN 
occurred in 2% of patients on 
fingolimod and 1% of patients on 
placebo. In clinical trials, 
fingolimod was discontinued if the 
elevation exceeded 5 times the 
ULN. Recurrence of liver 
transaminase elevations occurred 
with rechallenge in some patients, 
supporting a relationship to 
fingolimod. In clinical studies, 
transaminase elevations occurred at 
any time during treatment although 
the majority occurred within the 
first 12 months.. Serum 
transaminase levels returned to 
normal within approximately 
2 months after discontinuation of 
fingolimod. 
Gilenya has not been studied in 
patients with severe pre-existing 
hepatic injury (Child-Pugh class C) 
and must not be used in these 
patients (see section 4.3).

Proposed risk minimization 
activities (routine and additional) 
Due to the immunosuppressive 
properties of fingolimod, initiation 
of treatment should be delayed in 
patients with active viral hepatitis 
until resolution. 
Recent (i.e. within last 6 months) 
transaminase and bilirubin levels 
should be available before initiation 
of treatment with Gilenya. In the 
absence of clinical symptoms, liver 
transaminases levels should be 
monitored at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 
12 on therapy and periodically 
thereafter. If liver transaminases 
riseabove 5 times the ULN, more 
frequent monitoring should be 
instituted, including serum bilirubin 
and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
measurement. With repeated 
confirmation of liver transaminases 
above 5 times the ULN, treatment 
with Gilenya should be interrupted 
and only re-commenced once liver 
transaminases values have 
normalized. 
Patients who develop symptoms 
suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, 
such as unexplained nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, 
anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark 
urine, should have liver enzymes 
checked and Gilenya should be 
discontinued if significant liver 
injury is confirmed (for example 
liver transaminase levels greater 
than 5-fold the ULN and/or serum 
bilirubin elevations). Resumption 
of therapy will be dependent on 
whether or not another cause of 
liver injury is determined and on 
the benefits to patient of resuming 
therapy versus the risks of 
recurrence of liver dysfunction. 
Although there are no data to 
establish that patients with pre-
existing liver disease are at 
increased risk of developing 
elevated liver function tests when 
taking Gilenya, caution in the use 
of Gilenya should be exercised in 
patients with a history of significant 
liver disease.

4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
Macular edema with or without 
visual symptoms has been reported 
in 0.4% of patients treated with 
fingolimod 0.5 mg, occurring 
predominantly in the first 
3-4 months of therapy (see section 
4.8). An ophthalmological 
evaluation is therefore 
recommended at 3-4 months after 
treatment initiation. If patients 
report visual disturbances at any 
time while on therapy, evaluation 
of the fundus, including the macula, 
should be carried out. 
Patients with history of uveitis and 
patients with diabetes mellitus are 
at increased risk of macular edema. 
Gilenya has not been studied in 
multiple sclerosis patients with 
concomitant diabetes mellitus. It is 
recommended that multiple 
sclerosis patients with diabetes 
mellitus or a history of uveitis 
undergo an ophthalmological 
evaluation prior to initiating 
therapy and have follow-up 
evaluations while receiving 
therapy. 
Continuation of Gilenya in patients 
with macular edema has not been 
evaluated. It is recommended that 
Gilenya be discontinued if a patient 
develops macular edema. A 
decision on whether or not Gilenya 
therapy should be re-initiated after 
resolution of macular edema needs 
to take into account the potential 
benefits and risks for the individual 
patient.

SmPC state that the immune system 
effects of fingolimod therapy may 
increase the risk of infections. The 
SmPC will also state that two fatal 
herpetic infections occurred in 
patients on the 1.25 mg dose. As 
could be considered for any 
immune modulating drug, before 
initiating fingolimod therapy, 
patients without a history of 
chickenpox or without vaccination 
against varicella zoster virus (VZV) 
should be tested for antibodies to 
VZV. VZV vaccination of antibody 
negative patients should be 
considered prior to commencing 
treatment with fingolimod, 
following which initiation of 
treatment with fingolimod should 
be postponed for 1 month to allow 
full effect of vaccination to occur. 
SmPC recommendation to avoid 
the administration of live or live 
attenuated vaccines while patients 
are taking fingolimod and for 2 
months after discontinuation. 
SmPC states that before initiating 
treatment with fingolimod, a recent 
complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. 
within 6 months) should be 
available. Assessments of CBC are 
also recommended periodically 
during treatment, and in case of 
signs of infections. Absolute 
lymphocyte count <0.2 x109/L, if 
confirmed, should lead to treatment 
interruption, until recovery,

According to SmPC section 4.4 
Experience with Gilenya is limited 
in patients receiving concurrent 
therapy with beta blockers, heart-
rate-lowering calcium channel 
blockers (such as verapamil, 
diltiazem or ivabradine), or other 
substances which may decrease 
heart rate (e.g. digoxin, 
anticholinesteratic agents or 
pilocarpine). Since the initiation of 
Gilenya treatment is also associated 
with slowing of the heart rate (see, 
Bradyarrhythmia), concomitant use 
of these substances during Gilenya 
initiation may be associated with 
severe bradycardia and heart block. 
Because of the potential additive 
effect on heart rate treatment with 
Gilenya should not be initiated in 
patients who are concurrently 
treated with these substances In 
such patients, treatment with 
Gilenya should be considered only 
if the anticipated benefits outweigh 
the potential risks. If treatment with 
Gilenya is considered, advice from 
a cardiologist should be sought 
regarding the switch to non heart-
rate lowering medicinal products 
prior to initiation of treatment. If 
the heart-rate-lowering medication 
cannot be stopped, cardiologist’s 
advice should be sought to 
determine appropriate first dose 
monitoring, at least overnight 
extended monitoring is 
recommended  
According to section 4.5 of the 
SmPC 
Fingolimod has been studied in 
combination with atenolol and 
diltiazem. When fingolimod was 
used with atenolol in an interaction 
study in healthy volunteers, there 
was an additional 15% reduction of 
heart rate at fingolimod treatment 
initiation, an effect not seen with 
diltiazem. Treatment with Gilenya 
should not be initiated in patients 
receiving beta blockers, or other

According to SmPC Section 4.2, 
fingolimod should be used with 
caution in patients aged 65 years 
and over due to insufficient data on 
safety and efficacy. 
The safety and efficacy of 
fingolimod in children aged 0 to 
18 years have not yet been 
established. Currently available 
data are described in section 5.2 of 
SmPC but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
According to SmPC Section 4.6, 
before initiation of fingolimod 
treatment, women of childbearing 
potential should be counseled on 
the potential for serious risk to the 
fetus and the need for effective 
contraception during treatment with 
fingolimod. Since it takes 
approximately two months to 
eliminate fingolimod from the body 
on stopping treatment (see section 
4.4), the potential risk to the fetus 
may persist and contraception 
should be continued during that 
period. It should be confirmed that 
a woman is not pregnant at the time

The following additional risk minimisation activities were required: 
•  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
•  Revised Patient reminder Card 
•  Revised Physician Checklist 
In addition, the below condition to the Marketing authorisation is needed, to investigate further some 
of the safety concerns:  
Description 
Conduct of a prospective cohort study assessing the incidence of cardiovascular 
adverse events in patients starting GILENYA treatment for relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis based on a CHMP approved protocol. 
Due date 
Final study 
report by 15 
December 
2020 
In addition study FTY720D2121, a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study to investigate 
two different dose-titration regimens of fingolimod on the negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod in 
healthy subjects which is already started has been added in the risk Management plan 
Furthermore, the CHMP considered that the MAH should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
In Annex 8 the MAH has put key messages of the conditions, however the actual components of the 
educational materials (patient reminder card and physician checklist) with relevant changes addressing 
the outcome of this procedure is required. The MAH committed provide those materials with next 
update of RMP. 
For study D2406, the timing of recruitment, inclusion criteria and sample size should be further 
reviewed and assessed by the CHMP. The MAH has committed to submit a revision by 31 May 2012.  
1.1.  Product information 
The CHMP recommended amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics 
(SPC), Annex II and package leaflet. Within the summary of product characteristics sections 4.4, 4.5, 
4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 were updated with the safety information following the CHMP recommendations (see 
attachment to this report). 
1.2.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) 
As part of this procedure, the MAH and the CHMP agreed the wording of two ‘Direct Healthcare 
Professional Communication’ designed to inform prescribers of the Gilenya (see relevant attachments 
to this Report). 
Following the CHMP recommendations, the MAH provided an action plan for the DHPC (see attachment 
to this report), to be sent to relevant health care professionals. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Overall conclusion and benefit/risk balance 
In conclusion the CHMP reviewed all safety data available from clinical trial studies, alongside with all 
data from post-marketing data. These suggested an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
during the first 6 hours of administration of the first dose of fingolimod and especially 
bradyarrhythmia. Patients at risk have been identified as patients with history of cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events, as well patients receiving heart rate lowering agents such as beta-blockers and 
calcium channel blockers. In addition the incidents of hypertension are increasing with the 
administration of fingolimod. So the CHMP issued the following recommendations. 
All patients who start treatment with Gilenya should have an ECG and blood pressure measurement 
performed prior to and 6 hours after the first dose of Gilenya and be monitored for a period of 6 hours 
for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly heart rate and blood pressure measurement. 
Continuous (real time) ECG monitoring during this 6 hour period was recommended. Moreover, 
patients should be monitored until any observed symptoms seize to exist. 
Due to the risk of serious rhythm disturbances, the CHMP agreed that Gilenya should not be used in 
patients at risk. These include patients with second degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus 
syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block, in patients with a history of symptomatic bradycardia or recurrent 
syncope, or patients with significant QT prolongation.  
The CHMP considered that concomitant use of fingolimod with substances such as beta blockers, heart 
rate lowering calcium channel blockers may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. 
Therefore the CHMP recommended that treatment should not be initiated in patients who are 
concurrently treated with these substances. If treatment is considered in such patients, advice from a 
cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non heart-rate lowering medicinal products or 
appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation (at least overnight) if the heart-rate-lowering 
medication cannot be stopped. 
As fingolimod has been shown to provoke hypertension the CHMP concluded that Gilenya should not be 
used in patients of uncontrolled hypertension and until the hypertension is brought under control.  
The CHMP endorsed additional risk minimisation activities including a Direct Healthcare Professional 
Communication (DHPC). A previous communication was sent in January 2012 at the start of the 
procedure giving some preliminary recommendations to prescribers. In addition, the educational 
material to prescribers and patients was updated. 
The CHMP also agreed that a prospective cohort study assessing the incidence of cardiovascular 
adverse events in patients starting Gilenya treatment need to be conducted.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In view of the above data the CHMP agreed that the benefit-risk balance of Gilenya in the treatment of 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis remains positive under normal conditions of use, subject to the 
conditions, warnings, other changes to the product information, additional pharmacovigilance activities 
and risk minimisation measures agreed. 
Therefore the CHMP, recommended the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for which 
the revised product Information is set out in Annex III of the opinion. 
The scientific conclusions and the grounds for the amendment of the SmPC, Annex II, and package 
leaflet and the Annex under Article 127a are set out in Annex IV of the opinion. 
38 
 
 
 
The conditions affecting the marketing authorisation, as referred to in Article 32(4) of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended, are set out in Annex IV of the opinion. 
3.  Recommendations 
Update of sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 4.9 of the SmPC in order to add a warning update the safety 
information regarding the cardiovascular safety of Gilenya following the first dose administration. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
3.1.  Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Risk management system  
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in version 3.2 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing 
authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
The CHMP agreed that updated educational material needs to be distributed by the MAH to insure the 
safe administration of Gilenya. The updated information pack should contain 
• The Summary of Product Characteristics 
• Physician’s checklist prior to prescribing Gilenya 
• Information about the Fingolimod Pregnancy Exposure Registry 
• Patient reminder cards 
More detailed description is reported in the following list: 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States. 
The Member States shall agree the final educational material with the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) prior to launch in their territory. 
The Member States shall ensure that, at launch and after launch, the MAH provides all physicians who 
intend to prescribe GILENYA with an updated physician information pack containing the following 
elements: 
• The Summary of Product Characteristics 
• Physician’s checklist prior to prescribing GILENYA 
• Information about the Fingolimod Pregnancy Exposure Registry 
• Patient reminder cards 
The physician’s checklist shall contain the following key messages: 
o  Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation  
 Before first dose  
o  Perform baseline ECG prior to the first dose of GILENYA (or when the last dose of GILENYA was 
more than two weeks previously). 
o  Perform blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of GILENYA (or when the last dose of 
GILENYA was more than two weeks previously).    
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Perform a liver function test prior to treatment initiation. 
o  Arrange ophthalmologic assessment prior to initiation with GILENYA in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or with a history of uveitis. 
Until 6 hours after first dose (or if the last dose of GILENYA was more than two weeks previously) 
o  Monitor the patient for 6 hours after the first dose of GILENYA has been administered for signs 
and symptoms of bradycardia, including hourly pulse and blood pressure checks. Continuous 
(real time) ECG monitoring is recommended. 
o  Perform an ECG at the end of the 6 hour monitoring period. 
>6 to 8 hours after first dose (or if the last dose of GILENYA was more than two weeks previously) 
o  If at the 6 hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first dose, extend 
heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate increases again. 
If a patient requires pharmacologic intervention during monitoring at treatment initiation overnight 
monitoring in a medical facility should be instituted.  
o  Recommendation for overnight monitoring after the first dose (or if the last dose of GILENYA was 
more than two weeks previously)   
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of 
findings in patients  
o  Requiring pharmacologic intervention during monitoring at treatment initiation 
o  With 3rd degree AV block occurring at any time 
o  Where at the 6 hour time point: 
•  Heart rate < 45 bpm  
•  New onset 2nd degree or higher AV block  
•  QTc interval ≥ 500 msec  
o  That GILENYA is not recommended in patients with: 
o  2nd degree Mobitz Type II or higher AV block  
o  Sick-sinus syndrome 
o  Sino-atrial heart block 
o  QTc prolongation >470 msec (females) or >450 msec (males) 
o  Ischaemic cardiac disease including angina pectoris 
o  Cerebrovascular disease 
o  History of myocardial infarction 
o  Congestive heart failure 
o  History of cardiac arrest 
o  Severe sleep apnea 
o  History of symptomatic bradycardia 
o  History of recurrent syncope 
o  Uncontrolled hypertension.  
If GILENYA treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits must outweigh potential 
risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring, at least overnight 
extended monitoring is recommended.  
o  GILENYA is not recommended in patients taking concomitantly Class IA or Class III anti-arrhythmic 
medicines. 
o  GILENYA is not recommended in patients concomitantly taking medicines which are known to 
decrease the heart rate. If GILENYA treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits 
must outweigh potential risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to switch to non-heart rate 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
lowering therapy or, if not possible to determine appropriate monitoring. At least overnight extended 
monitoring is recommended.   
o  GILENYA reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. There is a need to check the patient’s 
peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) prior to initiation and to monitor during treatment with GILENYA.  
o  GILENYA may increase the risk of infections. Treatment initiation in patients with severe active 
infection should be delayed until the infection is resolved. Suspension of treatment during serious 
infections should be considered. Concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants or immune 
modulating medicines should be avoided. 
o  The need to instruct patients to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to their 
prescriber during and for up to two months after treatment with GILENYA. 
o  Specific recommendations regarding vaccination for patients initiating or currently on GILENYA 
treatment. 
o  The need for a full ophthalmologic assessment 3-4 months after starting GILENYA therapy for the 
early detection of visual impairment due to drug-induced macular edema. 
o  The need for ophthalmologic assessment during treatment with GILENYA in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or with a history of uveitis. 
o  The teratogenic risk of GILENYA: the importance of avoiding pregnancy when undergoing treatment 
with GILENYA and the need for a negative pregnancy test result prior to treatment initiation. This 
should be repeated at suitable intervals. 
o  The need to advise women of child-bearing potential on the serious risk to the foetus and to need to 
practice effective contraception during treatment and for at least two months following 
discontinuation of treatment with GILENYA. 
o  The need for a liver function monitoring at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during GILENYA therapy and 
periodically thereafter.  
o  The need to provide patients with the patient reminder card. 
The patient reminder card shall contain the following key messages: 
o  That they will have a baseline ECG and blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of 
GILENYA (or when the last dose of GILENYA has been administered more than two weeks ago). 
o  That their heart rate will need to be monitored for 6 or more hours after the first dose of GILENYA 
(or when the last dose of GILENYA has been administered more than two weeks ago) including 
hourly pulse and blood pressure checks. Patients may be monitored with a continuous ECG during 
the first 6 hours. They will need an ECG at 6 hours and in some circumstances monitoring may 
involve an overnight stay.  
o  The need to report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of GILENYA. 
o  GILENYA is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or those taking medicines 
concomitantly known to decrease heart rate and they should tell any doctor they see that they are 
being treated with GILENYA.   
o  The signs and symptoms of infection and the need to report these immediately to the prescriber 
during and up to two months after treatment with GILENYA. 
o  The need to report any symptoms of visual impairment immediately to the prescriber during and for 
up to two months after treatment finishes with GILENYA. 
o  That GILENYA is teratogenic so women with childbearing potential must: 
o  Have a negative pregnancy test 
o  Be using effective contraception during and for at least two months following discontinuation of 
treatment with GILENYA. 
o  Report any (intended or unintended) pregnancy during and two months following discontinuation 
of treatment with GILENYA immediately to the prescriber.

• 
The Committee considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, for 
Gilenya initiated by the European Commission. 
The Committee reviewed the available safety data from clinical trials and post-marketing data on 
the cardiovascular adverse events reported and in particular during the 24 hours after first dose 
administration of Gilenya. 
In view of the available data the Committee concluded that serious cases of bradyarrhythmia and 
hypertension have been reported with fingolimod. These occur in particular by 6 hours after the 
first dose administration of Gilenya. 
The Committee therefore recommended that all patients should have an ECG and blood pressure 
measurement performed at baseline prior to the first dose of Gilenya.  The committee agreed that 
Gilenya should not be used in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and as use of beta blockers 
and calcium channel blockers during treatment initiation may be associated with severe 
bradycardia and heart block, Gilenya should not be initiated in patients who are concurrently 
treated with these substances. Furthermore, if treatment is considered in all these at risk patients, 
advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine 
the most appropriate monitoring (at least overnight) for treatment initiation. These 
recommendations are reflected in the updated summary of product characteristics. 
The Committee is of the opinion that Gilenya should not be used in patients of uncontrolled 
hypertension until the hypertension is brought under control.  
The Committee, as a consequence, concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Gilenya in the 
treatment of highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis remains positive under normal 
conditions of use, subject to the conditions, warnings, changes to the product information, 
additional pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation measures agreed.  
The CHMP has therefore recommended the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for 
Gilenya in accordance to the Product Information set out in annexes I, II and IIIB and update of Annex 
related to Article 127a.

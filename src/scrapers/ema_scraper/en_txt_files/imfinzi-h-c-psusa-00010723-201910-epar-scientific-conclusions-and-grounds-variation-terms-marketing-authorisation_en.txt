Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for durvalumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Further to a PRAC request, the MAH submitted a cumulative safety review and analysis of neurological 
immune-mediated adverse events reported with durvalumab from all sources. In view of the available 
data and considering the safety profile of other medicinal products of the same class, the PRAC 
concluded that the product information of durvalumab should be amended.  
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC are updated to reflect that cases of meningitis, encephalitis and 
Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported with durvalumab in ongoing and completed trials. The 
Package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for durvalumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing durvalumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Protocol assistance 
The MAH received scientific advice from the CHMP on 31 May 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III) 
regarding non-clinical and clinical aspects of their proposal. After orphan drug designation, follow-up 
protocol assistance was provided by CHMP on 15 October 2020 
(EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/FU/1/2020/PA/SME/II). The advice sought at that time pertained to the following 
clinical aspects of the dossier. 
•  Agreement with the dose selection for Part 2 of Study BLU-285-2203. 
•  Agreement with the proposal to include only patients with moderate-to-severe ISM in Part 2 of Study 
BLU-285-2203. 
•  Acceptability of the primary endpoint (proportion of responders, defined as patients experiencing at 
least a 30% decrease in ISM-SAF Total Symptom Score, from baseline to Cycle 7 Day 1), the 
statistical hypothesis to analyse the primary endpoint and the selection of and statistical hypotheses 
for key secondary endpoints. 
•  Adequacy of the safety database to support an extension of the indication for avapritinib to include 
the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ISM.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
AYVAKYT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) with 
moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare, clonal mast cells (MC) neoplasm driven by the KIT D816V mutation 
in ~95% of cases, which results in the abnormal activation of mast cells (Garcia-Montero et al, 2006; Jara-
Acevedo et al, 2015; Ungerstedt et al, 2022). 
The SM sub-classification based on WHO criteria is provided in the table below: 
Table 1. Systemic Mastocytosis Subclassification Based on WHO Criteria
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 10/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The prevalence of all types of SM is estimated at ~1 per 10,000, with the prevalence of indolent SM (ISM) 
accounting for ~0.8 per 10,000 (Cohen et al, 2014). In the Groningen region of the Netherlands, a major 
referral area for SM patients, the prevalence is estimated at 13 per 100,000. 
Systemic mastocytosis preferentially affects Caucasians and there is no sex predominance. Most cases of 
SM are sporadic and not inherited, occurring in people with no family history of the condition. 
Patients with non-advanced SM (90% to 95% of SM patients) primarily have ISM, but a small number of 
patients have the smouldering SM (SSM) variant, which is associated with increased organ infiltration and 
MC burden (Swerdlow et al, 2017).  
Although  organ  infiltration  by  MCs  is  less  extensive  in  patients  with  ISM,  MC  activation  leads  to  severe, 
even life-threatening, MC mediator-related symptoms and a poor quality of life (Pardanani, 2019; Gilreath 
et al, 2019). Patients with ISM progress to advanced SM (AdvSM) in approximately 2% of cases. Patients 
with  SSM  progress  to  AdvSM  or  transform  to  leukemia  in  approximately  9%  of  cases  and  have  a  worse 
survival compared with ISM patients (Trizuljak et al, 2020; Sperr et al, 2019). 
An overview of prevalence and incidence of SM in the EU is provided in table 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 11/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2. Overview of Prevalence and Incidence of Systemic Mastocytosis in the European Union 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Systemic mastocytosis is a clonal mast cell neoplasm, driven by the KIT D816V mutation, where 
abnormal activation of MC leads to debilitating life-threatening symptoms. Although heterogeneity 
characterizes the clinical presentation and prognosis of SM, the pathogenesis is largely shared, with gain 
of function D816 KIT mutations occurring in 93% of SM cases, regardless of subtype (Garcia-Montero et 
al, 2006). This shared molecular pathogenesis suggests that a potent, selective, targeted agent against 
the KIT D816V mutation could be effective across SM subtypes, regardless of the clinicopathological 
presentation. 
Serum tryptase is an important biomarker for mast cell burden and activity and is part of the WHO 
diagnostic criteria for SM. Although specific criteria of response in objective measures of mast cell burden 
do not exist for ISM, reduction of 50% or greater from baseline serum tryptase is a criterion for partial 
remission in the IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria used in AdvSM (Gotlib et al, 2013), and potentially a marker of 
disease modification in ISM.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The formal diagnosis of SM is based on pathologic and laboratory criteria established by the WHO 
(Swerdlow et al, 2017). A diagnosis of SM can be made with the documentation of multifocal dense 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 12/179 
 
 
 
 
 
infiltrates of neoplastic MCs in bone marrow (BM) and/or other extra cutaneous organs (major criterion) 
and at least 1 of the following minor criteria: 
•  Atypical MC morphology in BM and/or extra cutaneous tissue 
• 
Presence of the KIT D816V mutation in BM, blood, or other extracutaneous organ 
•  Abnormal expression of CD25 with or without CD2 on MCs in BM, blood, or other extracutaneous 
organ 
•  Elevated serum tryptase levels 
If the major criterion is not present, a diagnosis of SM can still be made if 3 of the 4 minor criteria are 
fulfilled. 
SM is broadly divided into advanced SM and non-advanced SM, - based on the degree of organ infiltration 
(B-findings) and organ damage (C-findings) present, as well as the presence of adverse pathologic 
features - both of which are characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation and activation of mast cells, 
often present as aggregates in bone marrow, skin, spleen, liver, GI tract, and other organs (Metcalfe, 
2008).  (Table 3). 
Table 3. B- and C-Findings in Systemic Mastocytosis 
Approximately 10% to 20% of patients meet the WHO diagnostic criteria for advanced SM; the remainder 
have non-advanced ISM with the exception of a small subset who have non-advanced SSM (Sperr et al, 
2019). 
Patients with ISM suffer from a broad spectrum of persistent and debilitating symptoms (Jennings et al, 
2018; Mesa et al, 2022; Pulfer et al, 2021; van Anrooij et al, 2016). Mutant KIT drives the accumulation 
and hyperactivity of aberrant mast cells, leading to excessive signaling of vasoactive and inflammatory 
cytokines, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and interleukins (Jackson et al, 2021). Aggregates of 
activated proliferating mast cells, driven by mutant KIT, result in a constellation of symptoms leading to a 
significant reduction in quality of life (QoL) caused by recurrent diarrhoea, pruritus, abdominal pain, 
nausea, headache, flushing, cognitive impairment, fatigue, bone pain, and disfiguring skin lesions that are 
observed across the spectrum of the disease (Magliacane et al, 2014; Theoharides et al, 2015).  
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 13/179 
 
 
 
 
 
Among patients with SM, 46% (ISM) to 56% (SM) experience anaphylaxis (Brockow et al, 2008; Gülen et 
al, 2014).  
Management 
Therapies currently recommended for ISM are considered palliative, administered with the intent of only 
improving symptoms. Commonly used therapies for treatment of ISM symptoms are presented in the 
table below.

Globally, there are currently no approved treatments for patients with ISM aiming to reduce their disease 
burden, treat the underlying driver of ISM, or which impact the ISM disease course. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Avapritinib (BLU-285) is a small molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ATC classification code 
L01EX18) that targets KIT D816V, PDGFRA and PDGFRA D842 mutants as well as multiple KIT exon 11, 
11/17 and 17 mutants. Certain mutations in PDGFRA and KIT can result in the autophosphorylation and 
constitutive activation of these receptors which can contribute to tumour cell proliferation. Other potential 
targets for avapritinib include wild type KIT, PDGFRB, and CSFR1. 
Avapritinib is currently approved for treatment of unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal 
tumour (GIST) - with a recommended starting dose of 300 mg once daily-, and for the treatment of 
aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological 
neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy – with a 
recommended starting dose of 200 mg once daily.  
The new (initially) claimed indication is: 
“AYVAKYT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM).” 
For ISM, the recommended dose of avapritinib is 25 mg orally once daily.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The avapritinib SM clinical development program was initiated in June 2015 and to date consists of the 
following studies. 
Systemic mastocytosis – AdvSM 
• 2 clinical studies in patients with AdvSM (BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202, both ongoing) 
• An open-label expanded-access program in patients with AdvSM (BLU-285-EAP-02, completed) 
• An external control, observational, retrospective study of avapritinib in patients with AdvSM that 
collected retrospective data on patients treated with BSC in the real-world setting to enable comparative 
analyses on the efficacy and safety of avapritinib vs BSC (BLU-285-2405, completed) 
Systemic mastocytosis – ISM 
• A clinical study in patients with ISM (BLU-285-2203, ongoing) 
• An open-label expanded-access program in patients with ISM (BLU-EAP-ISM, ongoing) 
Systemic mastocytosis – General 
• A registry for patients with mastocytosis (Mast Cell Connect Mastocytosis Registry, completed) 
• A screening study evaluating the prevalence of KIT D816V mutation in patients with systemic mast cell 
activation (BLU-SM-1101, ongoing) 
As outlined above, scientific advice/protocol assistance was requested in two occasions. The 
recommendations regarding clinical aspects have overall been followed. However, the same does not 
apply to suggestions made regarding the non-clinical development; see section 2.2. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement confirming that the clinical studies have been conducted in agreement 
with GCP compliance.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
New non-clinical information related to the potential genotoxic and carcinogenic effect of avapritinib has 
been produced from the last line extension of Ayvakit. The new studies submitted in this variation 
included a new in vivo mammalian alkaline Comet assay in rat and the 6-month transgenic mouse 
carcinogenic assessment study. Also, an exploratory brain analysis from samples of the 3-month repeat-
dose toxicology study conducted in dogs was reported.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional pharmacology studies have been conducted with avapritinib for this new indication, which 
was considered acceptable by CHMP. These studies were provided in the initial MAA.

2.2.3.  Toxicology  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies indicated that cases of haemorrhage in the brain and spinal cord occurred 
in dogs at doses greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 9.0, 1.8 and 0.8 times the human 
exposure based on AUC at 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg dose once daily, respectively) and choroid plexus 
oedema in the brain occurred in dogs at doses greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 
4.7, 1.0 and 0.4 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 
mg once daily, respectively). Rats manifested convulsions, which was potentially secondary to inhibition 
of Nav 1.2 at systemic exposures ≥96, 12 and ≥8-fold higher than the exposure in patients at the clinical 
dose of 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg once daily.  
In a 6 month repeat dose toxicology study in rats, rats manifested haemorrhagic and cystic degeneration 
of the ovarian corpus lutea and vaginal mucification at dose levels greater or equal to 3 mg/kg/day with 
exposure margins of 15, 3 and 1.3 times the human exposure based on AUC at 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 
mg, respectively. In a 9 month repeat dose toxicology study in dogs, hypospermatogenesis (3/4 males) 
was observed at the highest dose tested, 5 mg/kg/day (5.7, 1.2 and <1 times the human exposure (AUC) 
at 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively).  
Genotoxicity 
The results of a new in vivo mammalian alkaline Comet assay in rat were presented. The previous one 
was submitted in the (variation EMEA/H/C/5208/X/004/G). Both assays followed a similar protocol. 
Animals were treated for 2 days by oral gavage and the doses were 37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg/day for males 
and 25, 50, 100 mg/kg/day for females. The only difference was the batch used, being for this new assay 
Batch 119200T9009 instead of 0285/02. 
It was concluded that avapritinib was negative under the conditions of the study, given that no DNA 
damage in the liver was induced after oral administration at 0 and 24 hours. 
Carcinogenicity 
Previous to the definitive 6-month carcinogenicity study, a 5-day and 28-day oral toxicity study was 
conducted in mice (CByB6F1 wild-type mouse (non-TG mouse)). After 4 weeks of avapritinib treatment 
on a daily basis (10, 30 or 100 mg/Kg/day), adverse microscopic findings and correlating haematology 
changes at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day were observed. The NOAEL was established at 10 mg/kg/day, resulting in a 
mean AUC0-24hr value of 40,200 hr*ng/mL and a mean Cmax value of 2790 ng/mL for males and females 
combined on Day 28. 
In the definitive study, avapritinib was administered to transgenic mice (CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 hemizygous) 
by oral gavage on a daily basis for 26 weeks (3, 10 or 20 mg/Kg/day). The study report indicated no 
avapritinib-related effects on survival. Clinical observations included skin pallor and discoloration/fur 
staining (white and/or pale) at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day group males and/or females. Regarding organ weights, 
lower thymus weights at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day group males and females were reported, microscopically 
corresponded with lower cellularity of the thymic cortex in both groups.  
No significant difference in terms of systemic exposure was found between males and females. No 
accumulation was observed after comparison exposure on days 1 and 182. The exposure levels quantified 
at the highest dose evaluated (20 mg/kg/day at day 182) were: mean AUC(0-24) value of 72,300 
ng*hr/mL and mean Cmax value of 4550 ng/mL.

In addition to these studies, a carcinogenic risk assessment based on a weight of evidence (WoE) 
approach was presented by the MAH, in line with the addendum ‘Testing for Carcinogenicity of 
Pharmaceuticals’ (ICH S1B[R1], 2022). A long-term carcinogenicity study with avapritinib is ongoing. 
Reproduction toxicity 
No new data related to reproduction toxicity have been presented in this variation. Nevertheless, the MAH 
reconsidered the information included in the SmPC regarding the potential effect of treatment with 
AYVAKYT on male and female fertility and has amended SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 accordingly. 
The nonclinical data informing on fertility in humans comprises a dedicated combined male and female 
fertility and early embryonic development study conducted in rats at oral avapritinib doses of 3, 10, and 
30 mg/kg/day for males, and 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day for females. 
The MAH stated that no direct effects on male or female fertility were noted at the highest dose levels 
tested in this study (100.8 and 62.6 times the human exposure (AUC) at 25 mg, 20.3 and 9.5 times the 
human exposure (AUC) at 200 mg and 8.7 and 4.1 times the human exposure (AUC) at 300 mg). 
Reduction in sperm production and relative testicular weight were observed in male rats administered 
avapritinib at exposures of 7 and 30 times, 1 and 5 times, and 0.6 and 3 times the 25 mg, 200 mg, and 
300 mg human doses, respectively. Nevertheless, hypospermatogenesis (3/4 males) was observed in the 
9 month repeat-dose toxicology study in dogs at the highest dose tested, 5 mg/kg/day (5.7, 1.2 and <1 
times the human exposure (AUC) at 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively). 
Regarding female fertility, the 6 month repeat dose rat toxicity study revealed haemorrhagic and cystic 
degeneration of the ovarian corpus lutea and vaginal mucification at dose levels greater or equal to 3 
mg/kg/day with exposure margins of 15, 3 and 1.3 times the human exposure based on AUC at 25 mg, 
200 mg and 300 mg, respectively.  
The MAH has included wording in SmPC section 4.6 and section 5.3 to inform on the potential effect of 
treatment with AYVAKYT on male and female fertility at doses of 200 mg or greater. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data of the 6-month carcinogenicity study are shown in the section above.

2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has submitted additional information related to ERA of avapritinib, resulting in the absence of 
significant increase of PEC surface-water parameter, which is below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L. 
Consequently, no phase II would be required.  
2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Avapritinib was initially approved for the indication of GIST and then extended to AdvSM. It showed broad 
inhibitory activity against both primary and secondary KIT and PDGFRA mutants, especially against 
mutations in exons 17 and 18 including the D816V mutant in KIT (IC50 = 0.27 nM) and the D842V mutant 
in PDGFRA (IC50 = 0.24 nM). For this new indication, no additional pharmacological studies have been 
conducted, which was considered acceptable.  
An exploratory brain analysis from samples of the 3-month repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs has 
been provided with this variation procedure. No effect was reported in animals treated at 30 mg/Kg/day 
compared to control individuals. It is noted that due to the limited number of animals, no effect of 
treatment or sex for microglia present in the brain could be concluded. No update of the SmPC was 
deemed necessary. 
In terms of potential genotoxicity of avapritinib, the results reported from a new in vivo Comet assay 
confirmed those obtained in the initial similar study. It is noted that the only difference between both 
assays is the batch used with no other differences reported. The information obtained is already included 
in the section 5.3 of the SmPC, and no modification is considered at this point, which was agreed.  
With regards to the carcinogenicity profile of avapritinib, the MAH has presented a carcinogenic risk 
assessment based on a WoE approach. It should be noted that the MAH anticipates that a  carcinogenic 
potential of avapritinib in humans is unlikely. It is noted that a previous scientific advice to conduct the 2-
year carcinogenicity study in rats was not followed by the MAH.  
As part of the carcinogenic risk assessment, the results of the short-term carcinogenicity study (6-month 
in CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 Hemizygous Mice) were shown and have been added to the section 5.3 of the 
SmPC. In this study, clinical observations were noted in the skin and microscopic findings of decreased 
cortical cellularity with corresponding reduction in thymus weights were reported at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. It is 
noted that the selection of dose levels for this study was based on a 28-day study, in which clinical signs 
were limited to thin fur cover of the forepaw and hind paws (left and right) in females of the 30 and 100 
mg/kg/day groups with no changes in body weight or food consumption. Histopathological changes were 
reported at ≥ 30 mg/Kg/day (sternal bone marrow and thymus). The MAH selected a maximum dose of 
20 mg/Kg/day (54.4-fold humans at the dose of 25 mg) for the 6-month study in transgenic mice based 
on the 50-fold plasma AUC exposure ratio (rodent:human) criterion. However, given that a higher dose 
level used in the 28-day study (30 mg/Kg/day) had shown a limited toxicity in the previous study, it is 
anticipated a low (almost negligible) toxic effect in the 6-month study for the 20 mg/Kg/day dose level. 
Similarly, dose level of 30 mg/Kg QD was described as well-tolerated (not even body weight was 
affected) in primary pharmacodynamic studies after 27 days of treatment (Pharmacology written 
summary, initial MAA), also anticipating the absence of a dose-limiting toxicity in the 6-month 
carcinogenic study. This was confirmed in the 6-month study, in which any change was observed in all 
tissues analysed. Based on the results of the 6-month transgenic mice study, the MAH concluded no 
carcinogenic effect of avapritinib.  
As for the histopathology data, the MAH mentioned NOAEL values, indicating the absence of hyperplasia 
or hypertrophy at these NOAEL values in the repeat dose toxicology studies. However, higher doses 
produced changes in organ weights, bone growth effects in rats and histopathologic findings in dogs 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 18/179 
 
 
 
 
(bone marrow, spleen and testis) even at the recovery euthanasia.  
With regards to the hormonal perturbation analysis, the MAH noted that findings were not indicative of 
direct hormonal changes. However, taking into account that KIT is described to regulate mammalian 
spermatogenesis along with the effect observed in testis, it should be reconsidered in terms of potential 
hormonal perturbation. Indeed, effects on adrenal and prostate glands, vagina and ovaries as well as 
hypospermatogeneis have been reported in repeat dose toxicology studies.  
In the assessment of potential for immune modulation, it is noted that immune systems changes were 
reported in toxicity studies and that dedicated immunotoxicity studies were not conducted with 
avapritinib. 
Finally, additional supportive clinical data were submitted by the MAH but no information related to the 
treatment duration of the reported cases has been shown. 
Taking together these all factors mentioned above, it can be concluded that a 2-year rat study would add 
value to the assessment of human carcinogenicity risk, given that carcinogenic potential in humans 
cannot be ruled out. Also, it should be considered that this new indication (ISM) is not an advanced 
cancer and patients are likely to have a normal life expectancy. The MAH stated that a 2-year 
carcinogenicity study with avapritinib in rats is currently ongoing. The final report is expected to be 
available in March 2026 and the information for the long-term carcinogenicity study has been accordingly 
modified in SmPC section 5.3. 
As this is a new therapeutic indication and in line with current ERA guideline (CPMP/SWP/4447/00), 
environmental risk update was included. As PEC surfacewater was below the action limit, no additional 
studies are required.  
As previously mentioned, new non-clinical data have been produced from the last variation of Ayvakyt 
submitted by the MAH. Additional estimations of the safety exposure margin based on the clinical dose 
(25 mg) for the novel indication, in addition to those estimated for previous indication (300/250 mg for 
GIST/AdvSM, respectively) have been incorporated in the section 5.3 of SmPC. In addition, based on non-
clinical finding in animals, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with avapritinib. 
SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 have been updated. 
Considering that patients with ISM tend to be younger than patients with AdvSM or GIST and may be 
more likely to want to pursue pregnancy, the MAH proposes to follow a conservative approach and based 
on CFTG guidance for drugs with suspected human fetotoxicity, proposes that an extension of the use of 
effective contraception by 2 weeks is recommended for women (i.e. from 1 month to 6 weeks). Based on 
the half-life of avapritinib, a 2 week washout period is adequate for the drug washout, in line with the 
proposed recommendation for contraceptive use in men with female partners of childbearing potential 
after the last dose of avapritinib.  The information regarding the need for contraception (in men and 
women) in section 4.6 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data are sufficient to support the extension of indication to include treatment of adult 
patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis. Updated information has been reflected in the SmPC 
sections 4.6 and 5.3.  
The updated ERA data submitted show that the use  in ISM patients does not lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure. Considering the above data, avapritinib is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address non-clinical issues:

The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  avapritinib  were  investigated  in  patients  with  Indolent  systemic 
mastocytosis (ISM) to assess: 
•  Analysis of the PK of avapritinib and the constitutive enantiomers BLU111207 and BLU111208 of its 
pharmacologically active metabolite M499 (BLU136707) using NCA methods, based on data obtained 
on C1D1 (single-dose PK) for Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, and on C1D15 (Part 1) or C2D1 (repeat-
dose PK) for Part 2 of the study. 
• 
Population  analysis  of  avapritinib  PK,  including  data  submitted  previously  from  Study  BLU-285-2101 
and  Study  BLU-285-2202  in  patients  with  AdvSM,  Study  BLU-285-1101  in  patients  with  GIST,  and 
Studies  BLU-285-0101,  BLU-285-0102,  and  BLU-285-0105  in  healthy  subjects,  with  a  covariate 
analysis to determine whether patient demographics and other factors can be used to explain inter-
individual variability in PK parameters. 
Study BLU-285-2203 
Study BLU-285-2203 is an ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of avapritinib in combination with BSC administered orally in adult patients with ISM.  
The study includes 3 parts: 
• 
• 
• 
In Part 1, the 25 mg QD RP2D of avapritinib was determined based on the administration of avapritinib 
at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg QD and the evaluation of efficacy, safety, and PK at each dose level 
(Table 5).  
In Part 2, the efficacy of the RP2D (25 mg QD) in combination with BSC was compared with placebo in 
combination with BSC.  
In  the  ongoing  Part  3  of  the  study,  patients  who  had  completed  treatment  in  Part  1  or  Part  2  are 
participating in a long-term extension, receiving 25 mg QD avapritinib in combination with BSC. As of 
the  data  cutoff  date  for  the  current  submission  (23  June  2022),  251  patients  were  treated  with 
avapritinib or placebo (39 in Part 1, 212 in Part 2, and 235 in Part 3). 
The PK parameters for avapritinib and the constitutive enantiomers of the M499 metabolite (BLU111207 
and BLU111208) after single (C1D1) and repeat (QD) dosing (C1D15 or C2D1) of avapritinib were estimated 
using NCA methods. Only samples from Part 1 and Part 2 of the study were analysed. No PK samples were 
analysed from Part 3. 
The sampling schemes for PK analysis are outlined in Table 6.

PK Parameter Estimation Set was defined as all patients who received a dose of avapritinib and had at least 
3 quantifiable concentrations post-dose. NCA was performed for this group of patients. Patients enrolled in 
Part 2 with sparse sampling had their exposure metrics derived using population pharmacokinetic methods. 
PK Population 
PK population was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of avapritinib and had at least one 
plasma sample collected, and was used for concentration-time listings. 
A flowchart detailing the PK Population and PK Estimation Set is shown in Figure 1.

In Part 1, a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure to avapritinib was observed across the dose 
range of 25 to 100 mg after single-dose administration (C1D1) and at steady state (C1D15) for Cmax and 
AUC (Figure 2 and Table 7).

Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The  overall  objective  of  the  analysis  was  to  update  the  population  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  model  to 
characterize  avapritinib  exposure  as  a  function  of  dose,  time  after  dosing,  and  patient  characteristics, 
including the variability between and within patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). To achieve 
this the following sub-objectives were set: 
1. Perform exploratory graphical analysis of the plasma concentration-time profile of avapritinib in study 
BLU-285-2203. 
2. Evaluate and update the previously developed population PK model for avapritinib in healthy volunteers 
(HVs),  patients  with  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours  (GIST),  and  patients  with  advanced  systemic 
mastocytosis (AdvSM) to describe the plasma concentration-time data from clinical study BLU-285-2203 in 
patients with ISM. 
(a) Quantify population PK parameters, including typical parameter values and random inter-individual and 
residual variability. 
(b) Identify and quantify covariate effects which describe variability in the PK ofavapritinib. 
3. Estimate the maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss) and the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours at steady state (AUC0-24,ss) for patients recruited in 
study BLU-285-2203 Part 2, on cycle 1 day 15 (C1D15, steady state) where only sparse PK samples were 
collected. 
The PK Model was updated in a step-wise manner as follows: 
1. Previously developed population PK model was fitted to the data from only study BLU-285-2203 without 
parameter estimation, in a process known as Bayesian feedback. Any biases or changes specific to the ISM 
population were then compared to the previous analysis populations to inform the model update in the next 
step. 
2. Data from other studies were included in the model with full parameter estimation. 
3. Covariate effects were evaluated through visual inspection of covariate-eta relationships for any obvious 
trends.

Previously Developed PK Model for Avapritinib 
The analysis  was performed by updating the previously developed population PK model in HVs, patients 
with  GIST,  and  patients  with  AdvSM,  with  data  from  patients  with  ISM.  The  PK  model  was  a  two-
compartment  disposition  model  with  absorption  modelled  via  4  or  5  transit  compartments  that  was 
dependent on the formulation.

Impact of Lean Body Weight on Avapritinib PK 
LBW  was  included  a  priori  as  a  covariate  on  Vc/F,  which  was  the  same  as  previously  described  in  the 
population PK model for HVs, patients with GIST and patients with AdvSM. 
The expression in the final population PK model is shown in Equation 7: 
VcF = 971 * (LBW=47.6)0.354        Equation 7 
Where 0.354 was the estimated covariate effect of LBW on Vc/F (note that the median LBW of patients with 
ISM in the analysis population was 47.6 kg). A graphical representation of the relationship between LBW 
and Vc/F is shown in Figure 7.

Impact of Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) Use on Avapritinib PK 
Concomitant PPI use was included a priori as a covariate on bioavailability (F) and KTR. The expressions in

F = GISTF * SMF * PPIF  Equation 8 
KTR = 3.41 (if Tablets) or 3.78 (if Capsules)  SMKTR  PPIKTR   Equation 9 
where GISTF and SMF are the covariate effects of being a GIST or AdvSM patient on F, respectively, and 
PPIF is the estimated covariate effect of concomitant PPI use, where it is 1 if there was no concomitant PPI 
use (0 to less than 5 consecutive days of PPI use prior to the PK sample), and 0.833 if there was equal or 
more than 5 consecutive days of PPI use prior to the PK sample. For the effect on KTR (Equation 9, PPIKTR), 
it is 1 if there was no concomitant PPI use, and 0.869 if there was equal or more than 5 consecutive days 
of PPI use prior to the PK sample collection.

Figure 8. Model Predicted Effect of Concomitant PPI 
Impact of Patient Population on Avapritinib PK 
The  covariate  effect  of  patient  population  on  F  is  shown  in  Equation  8.  Patients  with  ISM  had  overall 
exposure comparable to HVs and the relative F for patients with ISM and HVs were fixed to 1. As previously 
reported,  patients  with  GIST  had  a  reduced  F  compared  to  HVs  and  GISTF  was  estimated  to  be  0.856 
(GISTF was fixed to 1 for other patient populations). Similarly patients with AdvSM had the lowest overall 
exposure compared to the other patient populations and SMF was estimated to be 0.667 (SMF was fixed to 
1 for other patient populations). 
Patients with AdvSM was also found to have higher KTR previously and this relationship was included in the 
model  a  priori.  The  covariate  effect  of  patient  population  on  KTR  is  shown  in  Equation  9,  where  KTR  is 
dependent on the formulation, and SMKTR was to be 1.19 for patients with AdvSM (SMKTR was fixed to 1 
for other patient populations). 
As previously reported, patients with AdvSM exhibited time-dependent reduction in CL/F, which is shown 
in Equations 10-11 
CL F=16.9*SMCL*TIMCL     Equation 10 
TIMCL=1 (if Healthy or GIST)  or 1-  (Time (h)*0.394)/(190*Time(h))   (if AdvSM)    Equation 11 
where SMCL is the covariate effect of AdvSM on CL/F and estimated to be 1.3. TIMCL is a time-dependent 
decrease in CL/F for patients with AdvSM, where the maximum decrease in CL/F compared to other patient 
population was 39.4%, and the time  at half maximum decrease of CL/F was estimated to be 190 hours 
since the first dose. A graphical representation of the overall effect of patient population on avapritinib is 
shown in Figure 9.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Given the non-malignant nature of ISM and the difference between the recommended avapritinib dose for 
patients with ISM (25 mg QD) and the higher recommended doses for patients with AdvSM (200 mg QD) 
or  GIST  (300  mg  QD),  together  with  the  anticipated  differences  in  benefit-risk  considerations,  the  E-R 
analysis of efficacy and safety outcomes included only data from patients with ISM from Study BLU-285-
2203. 
The objectives of this analysis were to: 
1. Graphically evaluate the effect of avapritinib exposure on selected measures of efficacy and safety in 
ISM patients from study BLU-285-2203. 
2. Present an ER model for the primary efficacy endpoint in ISM patients from study BLU-285-2203. 
3. Perform additional descriptive analyses to support dose evaluation. 
Analysis Populations 
•  Efficacy Population 
The efficacy analysis was conducted in patients on placebo or active treatment up to at least C7D1. 
•  Safety population 
The  safety  analysis  was  conducted  in  all  patients  who  were  enrolled  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
avapritinib. Additionally, patients on placebo were also included in the safety analyses. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The following measures of efficacy were evaluated: 
•  Activity of avapritinib as measured by change (Δ) in TSS from baseline to C7D1 (or equivalent for 
patients from Part 1). 
•  Activity of avapritinib as measured by a ≥30% reduction in TSS from baseline. 
•  Activity of avapritinib as measured by a ≥50% reduction in TSS from baseline. 
•  Activity of avapritinib as measured by a ≥50% reduction in serum tryptase from baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 52/179 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety Endpoints 
The following measures of safety were evaluated: 
•  All Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs). 
•  Grade ≥1 cognitive effects. 
•  Grade ≥1 edema. 
•  Grade ≥2 total bilirubin. 
•  Grade ≥2 hemoglobin. 
•  Grade ≥1 weight gain/increase. 
Each safety endpoint was dichotomized as experiencing zero or ≥ 1 occurrence/event, where only the first 
onset of an event per patient (and corresponding time to that event) was considered in the analysis (ie, 
repeat events were not analyzed). If an event occurred either 2 days after the last dose, or after the end 
of study participation (whichever occurred first), the event was declared as censored. 
Exposure Parameters 
The  final,  updated  population  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  model  of  avapritinib  was  used  to  derive  individual 
estimates of avapritinib exposure. 
Cave was derived empirically for each individual using their observed dosing records and empirical Bayes 
estimates (EBEs) from NON linear Mixed Effects Modelling software (NONMEM). More specifically, for ΔTSS, 
Cave was computed from the start of treatment until C7D1 (or equivalent for patients in Part 1). For the 
dichotomous efficacy and safety endpoints, Cave was computed from the start of treatment until the first 
occurrence of an event or censoring. 
Summary of Exposures 
Figure 19 displays the distribution of Cave computed up to C7D1 by treatment arm. The PK of avapritinib 
in ISM patients from study BLU-285-2203 was approximately linear across the dose range of 25 mg to 100 
mg.

Efficacy 
A total of 249 patients were included in the efficacy population. Fifteen of these patients had missing values 
for ΔTSS (i.e., 2 patients from Part 1 and 13 patients from Part 2); therefore, 234 patients were included 
in analyses of ΔTSS. 
Figure 20 displays the relationship between ΔTSS and Cave. The average ΔTSS was approximately -9.65 
points in patients on placebo. For patients on active treatment, the average ΔTSS was approximately -17.0 
points across the exposure range.

Figure 20. ΔTSS vs. Cave 
ΔTSS was analyzed in a linear model framework: 
In Equation 1, Placeboi indicates placebo or active treatment for individual i (i.e., 0 = active treatment, 1 
= placebo), and TSSbaseline, i indicates the baseline value of TSS for individual i. 
Due  to  a  change  in  scope  of  the  originally  planned  ER  analyses,  covariate  modelling  and  simulation  for 
ΔTSS was not performed. 
Table 32 reports the parameter estimates from the model described in Equation 1. After adjustment for 
baseline TSS, there was no evidence for a Cave effect (p = 0.922), suggesting that the expected average 
ΔTSS  was  ≈  -16.7  points  across  the  exposure  range  in  patients  on  active  treatment.  There  was  also 
evidence that patients on placebo experienced less reduction in TSS at C7D1 from baseline compared to 
patients on active treatment (p = 0.002). 
Additionally, there was evidence that patients with higher baseline TSS experienced greater reductions in 
TSS at C7D1 (p <0.001; median TSS at baseline was 48.6 points).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Avapritinib  for  the  treatment  of  indolent  systemic  mastocytosis  (ISM)  in  adults  was  evaluated  in  the 
placebo-controlled phase 2 study BLU-285-2203.  
Non-Compartmental  Analysis  (NCA)  of  the  data  from  study  BLU-285-2203  reveals  dose  proportionality 
between 25 mg and 100 mg in patients with ISM at Day 1 and Day 15 of cycle 1 (C1D15), as the 90% CI 
ranges  within  the  accepted  critical  interval  of  0.5-1.5  and  the  graphical  representation  shows  the 
proportional relationship among dose levels. In addition, the impact of time-dependency processes on the 
avapritinib PK properties for the 25 mg QD dose between single dose and steady state conditions (C1D15 
Part  1)  revealed  an  AUC0-24  accumulation  ratio  of  3.59  (geometric  mean),  which  is  similar  across  the 
different  indications  and  doses  previously  evaluated.  Accumulation  of  BLU111207  and  BLU111208 
enantiomers was observed after repeated once daily dosing of 25 mg of avapritinib. At steady-state the 
metabolite to parent ratio of BLU111207 and BLU111208 was 10.3 and 17.5%, respectively, which is slightly 
lower compared to the ratios observed for patients with AdvSM at Cycle 1 Day 15 (20.5-29.9% and 25.9-
34.4%, respectively). 
For ISM, the recommended dose of avapritinib is 25 mg orally once daily, on an empty stomach (see Method 
of administration). This once daily 25 mg dose is also the maximum recommended dose that must not be 
exceeded  in  patients  with  ISM.  Treatment  of  ISM  should  be  continued  until  disease  progression  or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
The population PK analysis was based on a pooled dataset from 7 studies, which includes data of avapritinib 
in healthy volunteers (Study BLU-285-0101, Study BLU-285-0102 and Study BLU-285-0105), in patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023

with Gastrointestinal Stromal tumor (GIST) and other relapsed refractory solid tumours (Study BLU-285-
1101),  in  patients  with  Advanced  Systemic  Mastocytosis  (AdvSM)  and  relapsed  or  refractory  myeloid 
malignancies (Study BLU-285-2101, and Study BLU-285-2202) and in patients with ISM. 
The  final  dataset  for  the  current  Population  PK  model  development  included  a  total  of  9705  observation 
records from 656 subjects, which includes 1408 records from 169 subjects with ISM. Post-dose PK samples 
below limit of quantification (BLQ) were low and were excluded from the analysis. M1 method for handling 
BLQ-data is considered acceptable. The final popPK model was developed using 169 ISM patients, which is 
accepted,  but  only  1408  PK  observations.  The  evaluation  of  the  excluded  samples  was  conducted, 
demonstrating the adequacy of the current population PK model to account for the excluded samples due 
to  imprecise  reference  dose  time.  Although  the  excluded  samples  are  below  the  corresponding  95% 
prediction intervals of the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles at C1D15, it could be partially a consequence of 
the  imprecise  reference  dose  time.  Therefore,  an  adequate  predictive  capacity  of  the  PK  model  was 
demonstrated.  
The population PK model development includes the re-use of the previously developed model to characterize 
the PK of Avapritinib in healthy subjects, patients with GIST and patients with AdvSM. The structural and 
covariate effects were maintained and no further modification was included.  
Avapritinib  PK  was  described  using  a  linear,  2-compartment  model  with  4  or  5  absorption  transit 
compartments for tablet or capsule formulation respectively. The full PK model contains 7 covariates effects 
including LBW on Vc/F, concomitant PPI use on KTR and F, lower F in patients with GIST, lower F, lower 
KTR and time-dependent decrease in CL/F in patients with AdvSM. 
A  forest  plot  has  been  provided  to  assess  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  covariates  selected  based  on  the 
change  on  the  exposure  (AUC,ss  and  Cmax,ss).  The  analysis  revealed  no  clinically  relevant  changes  in 
exposure  except  for  AdvSM  patients,  which  is  expected  based  on  the  time  decrease  in  clearance  and 
decrease  bioavailability  of  this  sub-group  of  patients.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  of  avapritinib  is 
required based on the covariates included in the population PK model. 
An Exposure-Response analysis of efficacy and safety was performed including only data from patients with 
ISM from Study BLU-285-2203. 
Change (Δ) in TSS from baseline to C7D1 was used as the efficacy outcome and Cave was computed until 
C7D1 or the occurrence of an event and was used as the exposure metric in the exposure efficacy analysis. 
ΔTSS was analysed in a linear model and the results showed a slight improvement in ΔTSS in patients on 
active treatment compared to patients in the placebo group but not differences between the different doses 
where found. No exposure-efficacy relationships was established across the different dose levels evaluated 
(25-100  mg  QD).  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  establish  the  optimal  dosing  regimen  of  avapritinib  in 
patients with ISM from the presented exposure-efficacy relationship. 
Regarding the safety endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by quartiles of Cave were presented. The 
results  showed  a  statistically  difference  in  the  occurrence  of  grade  ≥1  oedema  between  the  active  and 
placebo groups. This result was expected as fluid retention is a frequent adverse effect related to the use 
of  avapritinib.  However,  no  exposure-safety  relationship  was  established  across  the  exposure  range  of 
avapritinib. Therefore, it is not possible to establish the optimal dosing regimen of avapritinib in patients 
with ISM from the presented exposure-safety relationship. 
The metabolism of avapritinib is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4/CYP3A5, so the concomitant treatment  
with  drugs  that  are  strong  or  moderate  CYP3A  inhibitors  or  inducers  can  increase  (with  inhibitors)  or 
decrease  (with  inducers)  the  exposure  to  avapritinib,  as  confirmed  by  a  clinical  study  with  concomitant 
administration  of  avapritinib  with  itraconazole  (a  potent  CYP3A    inhibitor)  or  rifampin  (a  potent  CYP3A 
inducer). The dosing recommendation for avapritinib is therefore to avoid the concomitant use of strong or  
moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.

The  MAH  provided  the  report  of  the  clinical  DDI  study  report  (BLU-285-0108)  that  aims  to  assess  the 
potential  interaction  of  avapritinib  in  combination  with  oral  contraceptives  and  to  provide  dosing 
recommendations if required. The combination LNG/EE was selected as this represents a widely used oral 
contraceptive. The clinical significant bounds of 90% confidence intervals (CIs) selected for this study were 
80.00%  -  140.00%  for  AUC0-inf  taking  into  account  the  doses  used  in  the  study  and  other  labelling 
recommendations and for Cmax an upper clinical significant bound less than 140% as decrease in Cmax is 
not supposed to affect the clinical efficacy. 
Sixteen  women  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  15  of  them  completed  the  study  and  one  of  them 
discontinued due to an adverse event (vision blurred). 
Following coadministration of 25 mg of avapritinib QD with a single dose of oral contraceptives 0.15 mg 
LNG/0.03 mg EE, based on GMR, LNG Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf were 7%, 13% and 16% higher that 
when LNG was administered as the combination of OC alone. The 90 % CI of LNG Cmax falls below the 
140% upper bound and the AUC0-inf falls within the 80-140% clinical significance bounds. On the other 
hand, based on GMR, EE Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf were 45.81%, 16.55% and 15.48% higher than when 
EE  was  administered  as  the  combination  of  OC  alone.  The  AUC0-inf  falls  within  the  80-140%  clinical 
significance bounds, however, the 90 % CI of LNG Cmax falls above the 140% upper (CI 17.16%-81.46%). 
Despite the slightly higher EE Cmax (45%) , very similar exposures of avapritinib at the proposed dosing 
regimen  at  single  and  steady-state  conditions  were  predicted  when  a  single  dose  of  LNG/EE  was 
coadministered. Therefore, no relevant differences in efficacy/safety are expected since no relevant changes 
in exposure were predicted. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of avapritinib in patients with ISM have been adequately 
characterized based on a totality of population PK model analysis developed in patients with AdvSM and 
GIST. The exposure-response analyses were not clinically relevant and the proposed dosing regimen 
seems adequate for the studied population and included accordingly in the SmPC.

The primary evidence of efficacy and safety of avapritinib in the treatment of ISM comes from Study BLU-
285-2203. This study was conducted in patients from North America, countries in the EU, and the UK. 
The focus for efficacy analyses in the current procedure is on patients with ISM treated with avapritinib at 
a dose of 25 mg QD.

Table 33. Overview of Clinical Studies  
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Part 1 of the main study BLU 285-2203 had as main objective determining the RP2D of avapritinib in 
patients with ISM for use in Part 2 and Part 3 of the study.  
This Part 1 is presented below under the main study BLU 285-2203 section. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study BLU 285-2203 is a 3-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate 
safety and efficacy of avapritinib (BLU 285) in patients with indolent and smouldering systemic 
mastocytosis with symptoms inadequately controlled with standard therapy. 
Methods 
Study BLU-285-2203 is a 3-part, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing 
the efficacy and safety of avapritinib in combination with best supportive care (BSC) to placebo in 
combination with BSC in patients with ISM whose symptoms were not adequately controlled by BSC.  
The study was conducted in 3 parts: 
• 
• 
• 
In Part 1, the optimal dose of avapritinib (RP2D) was identified in patients with ISM.  
In Part 2, patients with ISM were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to the avapritinib RP2D 
identified in Part 1 in combination with BSC, or to placebo in combination with BSC.  
In Part 3, patients who complete treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study can participate in a 
long-term extension, receiving avapritinib at the RP2D in combination with BSC.

Treatments 
Part 1 
Avapritinib (at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 mg QD) or matching placebo was administered orally in 28-day 
cycles for at least 12 weeks before rolling over to Part 3. Under the original protocol a 200 mg group was 
also included, however, based on a review of safety and efficacy data from the BLU-285-2101 Phase 1 
Assessment report

study, the 200 mg dose group in this study was removed and no patients received the 200 mg dose 
within this study. 
Part 2 
Avapritinib RP2D (25 mg) or matching placebo was administered orally, QD in Part 2 in 28-day cycles for 
6 cycles. After completion of 6 cycles (24 weeks) of treatment (C7D1) and all post-C7D1 study 
procedures, patients rolled over to Part 3 of the study where all patients had the opportunity to receive 
avapritinib 25 mg QD in an open-label fashion. 
Part 3 
Avapritinib 25 mg was administered orally, QD for up to 5 years, in 28-day cycles, inclusive of Part 1 and 
Part 2. The study drug was administered at the same dosing frequency as the last cycle in Part 1 or Part 
2. The dose administered could be modified under certain circumstances. 
In Part 2, dose escalations above 25 mg QD (placebo or avapritinib) were not permitted. 
In Part 3 open-label extension, dose escalation from 25 mg QD to 50 mg QD was permitted, if patients 
met the required criteria as indicated in the protocol.  
All patients continued to receive BSC throughout the study.

ISM-SAF questionnaire 
The Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis-Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF) is a 12-item PRO employed 
for the daily PRO assessment on an eDiary to assess symptoms in patients with ISM. Eleven items (bone 
pain, abdominal pain, nausea, the spots on the skin, itching, flushing, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, 
headache, diarrhoea) that assess the severity of symptoms are graded on an 11-point scale (0 to 10, 
none to maximum severity), and one item (diarrhoea) assesses the frequency. The ISM-SAF generates 
scores for each item, for skin domain, GI domain, neurocognitive domain and a TSS. The skin domain 
includes subscales of the spots on the skin, itching, and flushing, ranging from 0 to 30. The GI domain 
includes subscales of abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhoea, ranging from 0 to 30. The neurocognitive 
domain includes subscales of brain fog, headache, and dizziness, ranging from 0 to 30. The TSS is the 
sum of the 11 severity items ranged from 0 to 110. For all levels, higher scores represent increased sign 
and symptom severity. If any item score is missing, the corresponding domain and TSS score will be set 
as missing on a given day. 
The patient will complete the ISM-SAF daily for 4 weeks beginning at the time of informed consent, 
during which time BSC medications are optimized and stabilized. The ISM-SAF will be completed daily for 
an additional 2 weeks (14 days) to calculate eligibility TSS score to determine patient eligibility based on 
the ISM-SAF symptom threshold (≥28 vs. <28). Baseline symptoms will be collected for the 14 days 
immediately preceding the first dose of study drug or placebo. These data will be used to derive a 
Baseline TSS. Thereafter the ISM-SAF TSS will be calculated on a daily and bi-weekly basis. A daily TSS is 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 72/179 
 
 
 
 
 
created by summing the scores for each of the 11 items on a given assessment day, and a bi-weekly TSS 
(14-day average TSS) is created by averaging the summed daily scores over a pre-specified 14-day 
period and dividing by the number of non-missing days. A bi-weekly TSS is derived only if the subject 
completes the ISM-SAF on seven or more of the 14 days, otherwise it will be considered missing for the 
patient. The average of summed daily scores over a 14-day period, was calculated and used to assess 
eligibility for inclusion in BLU-285-2203 as well as treatment efficacy at each study timepoint. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part 2 is the mean change is ISM-SAF TSS from Baseline to Cycle 7 Day 
1 (C7D1). Change in TSS from Baseline to C7D1 is defined as (C7D1 TSS - Baseline TSS). 
The threshold for baseline ISM moderate vs. severe is 42.  
Table 34. Conceptual framework for the ISM-SAF 
Development of the ISM-SAF PRO questionnaire 
The qualitative activities undertaken during the development of the ISM-SAF included a review of 
empirical literature, advice meetings with therapeutic area experts, qualitative concept elicitation 
interviews with patients with ISM (n=13) or SSM (n=3), concept selection and questionnaire 
development, and qualitative cognitive debriefing interviews with patients with ISM.

A translatability assessment was conducted by an independent translation services provider. The following 
eight languages were selected for the evaluation: Danish (for Denmark), Dutch (for Netherlands and 
Belgium), Spanish (for Spain), French (for France), German (for Germany), Italian (for Italy), and 
Swedish (for Sweden). 
Qualitative cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted with patients with ISM to evaluate the ISM-
SAF for readability, comprehensibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. 
The psychometric performance of ISM-SAF scores was evaluated in an observational study (n=103), 
during part 1 of study BLU-285-223 (n=38) and in part 1 + part 2 of study BLU-285-223 (n=243). 
Identification of severity thresholds in the observational study 
As stated above, a prospective, observational study was performed to (1) generate cross-sectional 
psychometric data for ISM-SAF scores, (2) inform the use of the ISM-SAF as a clinical trial screening tool 
in BLU-285-2203, and (3) identify TSS cut-off scores capable of distinguishing patients with moderate to 
severe symptoms from those with mild symptoms. 
The observational study utilized an online survey of patients in the US diagnosed with ISM or SSM, who 
completed clinical outcome assessments using a web-based electronic platform over the course of 15 
days. In addition to the ISM-SAF, clinical outcome assessments included the Patient Global Impression of 
Symptom Severity (PGIS), 12-Item Short Form Survey, Version 2 (SF-12v2®), Mastocytosis Quality of 
Life Questionnaire (MC-QoL), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Cognitive Function (FACT-
Cog). 
A total of 116 eligible adult patients were screened into the study; 103 were included in the Self-reported 
Diagnosis Cohort, and 58 were able to provide medical documentation of diagnosis from their physician 
and were included in the Medically Documented Diagnosis Cohort. 
Based on the findings of both the ROC and contingency analyses, using the PGIS as an anchor, a bi-
weekly ISM-SAF TSS cut-off value of between 21 and 28 to identify patients with at least moderate 
symptoms was indicated for screening purposes in the BLU-285-2203 study. The upper value of 28 was 
selected as a more conservative estimate, and it was assumed that the use of this cut-off would retain a 
large enough sample to meet clinical study goals. These same analyses based on observational study 
data were used to establish a TSS cut-off value of 42 to distinguish patients with severe symptoms from 
those with moderate symptoms. 
Results from the observational study and from Part 1 of BLU-285-2203 were shared with the FDA and 
EMA, and are understood by the MAH to support the conclusion that the ISM-SAF produces reliable and 
construct valid scores when administered to patients in the target population. To provide further evidence 
of the reliability and validity of the ISM-SAF, the MAH conducted psychometric analyses based on pooled 
data from Part 1 and Part 2 of BLU-285-2203. A total of 243 patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 with 
ISM-SAF data at C1D1 and at C3D1, C4D1, or C7D1 were included in the psychometric analysis 
population (PsAP) for Part 1 and Part 2. Nearly all patients had bi-weekly scores for all ISM-SAF items 
throughout the study: 100.0% at Baseline, 98.8% at C3D1, 98.3% at C4D1, 99.2% at C6D1, and 97.9% 
at C7D1. 
Score interpretation and clinical relevance 
Researchers are using different nomenclature including the clinically important difference (CID) between 
groups and clinically important response, most recently referred to as meaningful within-patient change 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 74/179 
 
 
 
 
(MWPC). The CID reflects the difference in scores between two treatment groups that can be considered 
clinically relevant and distinguishes between-groups change from measurement error. In contrast, the 
MWPC is the amount of change an individual would have to report to support the conclusion that a 
treatment benefit has been observed. 
To assist in the interpretation of scores of the ISM-SAF, distribution-based methods, anchor-based 
methods, empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) curves, and probability density function (PDF) 
curves were employed. 
Anchor-based analyses from Part 1 Cycle 4 of BLU-285-2203 (based on a PGIS reduction of one or two 
points from baseline) were used to inform the conclusion that a 30% reduction in the TSS reflects an 
MWPC, a threshold that aligns with the treatment response criteria of ≥30% proposed by the European 
Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) and the American Initiative on Mast Cell Diseases (AIM) 
Consortium. Score interpretation conclusions from Part 1 were confirmed by the pooled Part 1 and 2 data. 
Additionally, CID estimates to facilitate the meaning of observed group differences using distribution 
based methods were proposed by the MAH. The range was generated using two independent distribution-
based methods (“1/2 standard deviation at baseline” and the “standard error of measurement”) as 
defined in the psychometric analysis SAP. CID range for the TSS was based on pooled Part 1 and 2 data, 
and confirmed the difference range previously observed for Part 1.   
Sample size 
Part 1 
The sample size for Part 1 of the study is not determined based on a specific statistical hypothesis; 
rather, it is chosen to allow analysis of ISM-SAF TSS, PK parameters, safety, and objective measures of 
MC burden for a range of avapritinib doses in the study population to enable further study of a RP2D in 
Part 2.  
Part 2 
Mean change in ISM-SAF TSS from Baseline to C7D1: 
With a 1:2 (placebo:avapritinib 25mg) randomization ratio, assuming the null hypothesis is the mean 
change of TSS of negative 10 in the placebo group, versus the alternative hypothesis of the mean change 
of TSS of negative 19.7 in the avapritinib group, the standard deviation of mean change of TSS is 
assumed to be 20, and a 1- sided type I error rate of 0.025, a total of 204 patients will have > 90% 
power using a 2-sample t-test. 
Supportive evidence was from analysis results from Part 1 showing -19.7 mean change (standard 
deviation 20.2, n=10) in patients treated with avapritinib 25 mg, compared to -3.2 mean change 
(standard deviation 9.0, n=9) in patients treated with placebo. Further, psychometric evaluation of the 
ISM-SAF in Part 1 using distribution-based methods identified a 10-point threshold as a conservative 
approach providing guidance for interpreting substantive results when using ISM-SAF for the comparison 
of treatment group mean difference. Therefore, in Part 2 the assumption of a mean change of negative 
10 in the placebo group was used to take a conservative approach to powering the study, while 
maintaining a difference of approximately 10 between placebo and avapritinib treatment. 
To ensure the study is powered for the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, 204 patients is 
the proposed sample size for Part 2. 
Part 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 75/179 
 
 
 
 
Patients rollover to Part 3 from Part 1 and Part 2. The number of patients in Part 3 will be approximately 
39+204= 243 patients. 
Randomisation 
The randomization assignment was implemented by the IRT after screening was completed: 
Part 1 
Enrolment into Part 1 of the study was randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to the 3 doses of avapritinib and 
placebo. Randomization was stratified by presence or absence of mastocytosis in skin at baseline and by 
baseline serum tryptase level (< 20 vs ≥ 20 ng/mL). All patients received the RP2D when they rolled over 
to Part 3. 
Part 2 
Enrolment into Part 2 of the study was randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to 25 mg avapritinib QD and placebo. 
All patients received 25 mg avapritinib QD (RP2D) when they roll over to Part 3. Randomization in Part 2 
was stratified based on baseline serum tryptase level (< 20 ng/mL vs ≥ 20 ng/mL). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study is double-blinded. Patients, monitors, study centre personnel related to the study, and the 
Sponsor were blinded to treatment assignment in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, with the exception of 
specific unblinded staff involved in safety and pharmacovigilance, and management of the IDMC. 
To ensure that the study team members were not unblinded inadvertently, the documentation containing 
patient treatment assignment information was stored in a pre-identified, secure, limited-access folder or 
secure network area.  
Statistical methods 
The final SAP for Part 2 and Part 3 of study dated 07 June 2022 and the interim analysis SAP for Part 1 of 
the study dated 03 February 2020.  
When analysing overall long-term data, information from Parts 1, 2 and 3 were included in the analyses. 
Analyses for Part 1 are presented by treatment group. Continuous variables were summarized by 
reporting the number of observations (n), mean, SD, median, min, and max.  
Categorical variables were summarized using frequency tables showing the number and percentage of 
patients within a particular category, where the denominator was the total number of non-missing values 
at the applicable time point (unless otherwise specified). Appropriate 95% CIs were also presented as 
needed. 
All analyses for Part 2 are presented by treatment arm, ‘placebo’ and ‘25 mg’ for patients who initially 
enrolled into Part 2 of the study. Part 3 analyses that use the Part 3 baseline are presented by patients’ 
initial treatment arm in Part 1 or Part 2 as the following: ‘placebo to 25 mg’, ‘25 to 25 mg’, ’50 to 25 mg’, 
‘100 to 25 mg’, ‘placebo’ or ‘25 to 25 mg’, and ‘overall’.  
The same layout as Part 3 is used for long-term avapritinib summary tables that use avapritinib baseline 
and data from Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 (definitions of baseline provided in Section 9.7.1.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023

Summary statistics for continuous variables included n (non-missing observations), mean, SD, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Summary statistics for categorical variables were presented in terms of 
frequencies and percentages. Time to event data were summarized using KM method, which included the 
number of events and censors, the estimated median with 95% CIs, minimum, maximum, and 25th and 
75th percentiles. 
Analysis populations 
• 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population: All randomized patients independent of whether they received the 
study drug or not. The primary efficacy analysis set is the ITT population. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population (only for Part 2 and 3): All randomized patients who met the following 
criteria: 
-  Confirmed to have ISM per WHO diagnostic criteria, including Central Pathology Review of 
bone marrow. 
-  Had no major violations of the inclusion criteria (#2, #3, #6) or exclusion criteria (#1, #5, 
#18): 
- 
Part 1 or Part 2 baseline TSS score ≥ 28. 
-  Had not received wrong study drug at any time during Part 2 of the study (ie, placebo patient 
received avapritinib by mistake, or vice versa). 
-  Had not received concomitant TKI treatment. 
•  Safety Population: All patients who received at least 1 dose of avapritinib or placebo. 
Adjustments for covariates 
For the primary analysis, an ANCOVA controlling for randomization stratification factor (serum tryptase 
<20 ng/mL vs ≥ 20 ng/mL) and baseline ISM status (moderate vs severe) was performed to compare 
avapritinib and placebo. 
Handling of dropouts or missing data 
No imputation was made for completely missing date unless otherwise specified. 
Interim analyses and data monitoring 
As per protocol, an interim analysis was performed to determine the RP2D, efficacy, and safety once all 
Part 1 patients had completed C4D1 assessments. No other interim analysis was planned for the study. 
Multiple comparison/multiplicity 
The gatekeeping procedure was used to test the primary endpoint and all four key secondary endpoints 
with the testing order shown in the below Figure 30 to ensure the family-wise type I error is strongly 
controlled for both the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints at 1-sided alpha of 0.025.

Results 
Study BLU-285-2203 has enrolled 251 patients with ISM, including 246 patients who have received at 
least 1 dose of avapritinib.  
The study is being conducted in 3 parts: 
•  Part 1 - Tested 3 doses of avapritinib in ISM patients (100, 50, and 25 mg vs placebo) and identified 
25  mg  as  the  RP2D  with  the  optimized  benefit-risk  for  patients  with  ISM  (39  patients;  duration  of 
treatment: at least 12 weeks) 
•  Part 2 - Conducted after the determination of RP2D, in patients with ISM randomly assigned to the 
avapritinib RP2D identified in Part 1 in combination with BSC (141 patients) or to placebo in combination 
with  BSC  (71  patients),  to  determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  avapritinib  in  combination  with  BSC 
compared with placebo in combination with BSC in patients with ISM with moderate to severe symptoms 
that could not be adequately controlled by BSC (duration of treatment: 24 weeks) 
•  Part  3  -  Is  ongoing  and  is  intended  to  further  characterize  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  long-term

Parts 1 or 2 will continue to receive avapritinib in this open-label extension cohort after completion of 
Parts 1 or 2. Part 3 duration of treatment: up to 5 years including durations of Parts 1 and 2. 
The study included 39 patients (9 patients in placebo, 10 patients in each group of avapritinib 25, 50, and 
100 mg) in Part 1 and 212 patients (71 patients in placebo and 141 in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group) in 
Part 2.  
Overall, 235 patients (34 patients from Part 1 and 201 patients from Part 2) rolled over to Part 3 from 
Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. 
Participant flow 
Patient disposition 
Part 1 of the study completed enrolment with 39 patients. All 39 patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 into 
1 of 3 avapritinib dose groups or placebo. Patients received a once-daily dose of either placebo (n=9) or 
avapritinib (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg: n=10 for each group).  
In Part 1, 2 patients from the 25 mg Avapritinib Group discontinued from the study due to non-
compliance and AE, respectively.  
In the 50 mg Avapritinib Group, 2 patients discontinued due to non-compliance and AE, respectively.  
In the 100 mg Avapritinib Group, 1 patient discontinued due to withdrawal by patient.  
A total of 34 patients completed Part 1 of the study and rolled over to Part 3.

Abbreviations: RP2D = recommended Phase 2 dose. 
In Part 2, both the ITT and Safety Populations included 141 patients in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 
71 patients in the placebo group.  
The PP Population in Part 2 included 123 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 67 patients in the 
Placebo Group. In Part 2, patient disposition was similar in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and Placebo 
Group. In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 5 patients discontinued from the study for the following reasons: 
withdrawal of consent (n=2), related AE (n=1), SM clinical progression (n=1), and Investigator’s decision 
(n=1).  
In the Placebo Group, 5 patients discontinued from the study (3 patients due to withdrawal of consent

and 2 patients due to other reasons).  
A total of 136 patients (96.5%) treated with 25 mg avapritinib and 66 patients (93.0%) treated with 
placebo completed Part 2 of the study. Of these, 1 patient in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group completed Part 
2 but did not roll over to Part 3. A total of 201 patients completed Part 2 and rolled over to Part 3.

part 3) 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; SM = systemic mastocytosis.  
Overall, 235 patients rolled over to Part 3 from Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. At the time of the data cut-
off (23 June 2022), 14 patients have discontinued from Part 3 of the study and 221 patients were 
ongoing. Of these, 5 patients discontinued due to AEs, 2 each due to progressive disease and withdrawal 
of consent, and 1 each due to investigator decision, patient decision, lost to follow-up, and patient 
withdrew as they requested dose escalation that was not permitted per protocol. Only 1 patient 
discontinued from the study drug due to lack of effectiveness. Updated data with a data cut-off date of 07 
April 2023 (an additional 10 months of follow-up) were provided during the procedure. At the time of this 
data cut-off, 24 patients have discontinued from Part 3 of the study and 211 patients were ongoing.

Protocol deviations 
In Part 1, overall, 10 patients had ≥ 1 major protocol deviation.  
The most common major protocol deviation was related to informed consent (7 patients overall). 
For patients enrolled in Part 2, 41 (29.1%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group vs. 7 (9.9%) patients 
in the Placebo Group had ≥ 1 major protocol deviation during Part 2 of the study.  
The most common major protocol deviations are outlined in the Table below. All other major protocol 
deviations occurred in < 2% of patients in either treatment group. 
Table 36. Major deviations in > 2% of patients (Part 2) 
a Two of the 11 patients categorized as having missed critical assessments were determined to be minor deviations after database lock and thus 
were miscategorized, therefore reasons for only 9 patients are listed in this table.  
b Two of the 6 patients categorized as having prohibited concomitant medication given were later determined to be minor deviations as the steroid 
use did not meet the criteria for major deviation (ie, use within 7 days before C7D1 or for 14 consecutive days during the study). Therefore, only 
4 patients are listed in this table.  
C Five additional patients who had protocol deviations for CYP 3A4 inhibitor use are not included in Table 99.1.2.1.1, as the start date of use was 
prior to study entry (see listing 16.2.2.1).  
Patients with missing TSS at Part 2 C7D1 were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis using ANCOVA 
method but was included in the sensitivity analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation 
method. Likewise, patients who received high dose steroids within C7D1 were excluded from the primary 
efficacy analysis using ANCOVA method but were included in the sensitivity analysis using MCMC 
imputation method.

At Part 2 baseline, patients in both the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and the Placebo Group had significant 
sign and symptoms burden as assessed by the ISM-SAF with a mean (SD) TSS of 50.17 (19.145) in the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group and 52.43 (19.823) in the Placebo Group. The thresholds for moderate 
symptoms of ISM were a TSS of ≥ 28 to < 42, and for severe symptoms of ISM a TSS of ≥ 42. The 
percentage of patients with severe symptoms of ISM was balanced between the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
(61.7%) and the Placebo Group (63.4%).  
Other baseline disease parameters including ISM-SAF domain scores, serum tryptase, KIT D816V MAF, 
bone marrow mast cells, and concomitant BSC use were similar in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and the 
Placebo Group and consistent with characteristics observed in the ISM patient population.  
At baseline, 12 of 212 (5.7%) patients tested negative for KIT D816V by both central and local testing 
(n=2 Placebo Group; n=10 Avapritinib Group).  
Medical and surgical history 
All patients in Part 2 had ongoing medical history. The majority of medical and surgical history events 
reported are commonly observed in patients with ISM and were similar in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
and Placebo Group. The most common medical history events by System Organ Class were 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (80.9% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 77.5% in the Placebo Group) 
followed by Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (79.4% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 
81.7% in the Placebo Group), and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (78.0% in the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and 73.2% in the Placebo Group).

Prior and concomitant medications 
All patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and the Placebo Group were treated with at least 2 current or 
prior BSC medications as per study inclusion criteria. The majority of patients in the Part 2 safety 
population received concomitant BSC medication/therapy (99.3% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 
100.0% in the Placebo Group). The most commonly used BSC medications were antihistamines for 
systemic use such as H1 antihistamines (97.2% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 100.0% in the 
Placebo Group) and drugs such as H2 antihistamines and proton pump inhibitors (73.8% in the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and 78.9% in the Placebo Group). 
Patients also received concomitant medication/therapy other than BSC (97.9% in the 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group and 100.0% in the Placebo Group). The most common concomitant medication/therapies other 
than BSC used were viral vaccine (43.3% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 43.7% in the Placebo 
Group) and other analgesics and antipyretics (36.2% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 35.2% in the 
Placebo Group). Antidepressants and anxiolytic medications were also used often (19.1% and 16.3% in 
the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 21.1% and 22.5% in the Placebo Groups, respectively). The use of 
opioids was similar between the 2 groups: 22.0% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 22.5% in the 
Placebo Group).

Outcomes and estimation 
The analysis of efficacy for avapritinib was based primarily on Part 2 results of the comparison between 
placebo and the RP2D of 25 mg avapritinib. 
The Part 1 analyses are based on a data cut-off date of 27 December 2019 and the Part 2 and 3 analyses 
are based on the data cut-off date of 23 June 2022. During the procedure, updated data of Part 3 were 
provided based on a data cut-off date of 07 April 2023. 
Part 1 of study BLU 285-2203  
At C4D1 (12 weeks of treatment), the mean (SD) reduction in TSS of the ISM-SAF was greater in all 
Avapritinib Groups compared with the Placebo Group: –12.54 (13.234) for the 25 mg group, –12.32

(14.194) for the 50 mg group, –21.35 (18.769) for the 100 mg group, and –3.36 (7.998) for the Placebo 
Group.  
The 100 mg dose was associated with the greatest reduction in TSS at C4D1. However, additional 
analyses showed that the TSS reduction plateaued after C4D1. The 25 mg and 50 mg dose groups 
achieved a similar mean reduction in TSS to the 100 mg cohort by C7D1.

average of TSS from Day 71 to Day 84. If a patient is missing more than 7 days of score between Day –14 to Day –1, the baseline TSS 
is considered missing for the patient. If a patient is missing more than 7 days of TSS between Day 71 to Day 84, the C4D1 TSS is 
considered missing for the patient.  
Patients in all Avapritinib Groups showed significant reductions in the key objective measures of disease 
compared to placebo at C4D1, with additional reductions at C7D1 in avapritinib-treated patients.

Based on the results from Part 1 of the study 25 mg avapritinib was chosen as the RP2D for Part 2 and 
Part 3. The 100 mg dose was associated with the fastest symptom reduction, with a rapid reduction in 
TSS to C4D1; however, the TSS reduction plateaued after C4D1. The 25 mg and 50 mg dose groups 
achieved a similar mean reduction in TSS to the 100 mg cohort by C7D1. 
Part 2 of study BLU 285-2203  
Primary efficacy endpoint - Mean change in ISM-SAF TSS, from baseline to C7D1  
At Part 2 Baseline, the mean (SD) ISM-SAF TSS was 50.17 (19.145) points for the 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group and 52.43 (19.823) for the Placebo Group.  
During treatment, there was reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS for both groups: In the Placebo Group, there 
was a reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS until C3D1, consistent with an early placebo effect, followed by a 
plateau of the ISM-SAF TSS through C7D1 (24 weeks). 
At C7D1, the LS mean (SE) change from baseline in the ISM-SAF TSS was –15.58 (1.536) points for the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group and -9.15 (2.013) for the Placebo Group.  
The difference (95% CI) between the groups was -6.43 (–10.90, –1.96) points. This difference was 
statistically significant (1-sided p-value = 0.003). As pre-specified, with a 1-sided p-value < 0.025, 
avapritinib is considered superior in reducing SM symptoms as compared to placebo.

Sensitivity analyses 
o  Mean change from baseline in ISM-SAF TSS at C7D1 using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
imputation  
A sensitivity analysis with MCMC simulation to impute the missing baseline or C7D1 values was performed 
in the ITT population. The sensitivity analysis was consistent with the primary analysis. At C7D1, the LS 
mean (SE) change from baseline in the ISM-SAF TSS was –15.33 (1.544) points for the 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group and –9.64 (2.023) for the Placebo Group. The difference (95% CI) between the groups was –5.69 
(–10.16, –1.23) points. This difference was statistically significant (1-sided p-value = 0.006). 
o  Mean change from baseline in ISM-SAF TSS at C7D1 in the PP Population 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis was performed in the PP population. The PP population 
included 123 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 67 patients in the Placebo Group.  
The sensitivity analysis was consistent with the primary analysis. Over time, there was reduction in the 
ISM-SAF TSS for both groups. At C7D1, the LS mean (SE) change from baseline in the ISM-SAF TSS was 
–16.80 (1.722) points for the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and -9.27 (2.198) for the Placebo Group. The 
difference (95% CI) between the groups was –7.53 (–12.36, –2.70) points. This difference was 
statistically significant (1-sided p-value = 0.001). The MCMC sensitivity analysis for the mean change in 
the ISM-SAF TSS in the PP population was consistent with the overall sensitivity analysis in the PP 
population and the primary analysis. 
o  Cumulative density function plots 
CDF plots of ISM-SAF TSS at C4D1 and C7D1 in Part 2 for the ITT were produced. The x-axis of the CDF 
plot presents TSS change from baseline and the y-axis presents the cumulative proportion of patients 
with the TSS change from baseline equal or smaller than the value specified in the x-axis. For any given

value of CFB (x-axis), the proportion of patients who had a CFB equal or smaller than that value was 
consistently greater in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group compared with the Placebo Group at C4D1 which 
improved at C7D1. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints  
•  Proportion of patients with ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reduction in ISM-SAF TSS in patients from 
baseline to C7D1 
The proportion of patients with ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS from baseline to C7D1 
were evaluated as key secondary endpoints. 
Over time, there was a greater increase in the percentage of patients with ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reduction 
in the ISM-SAF TSS for the 25 mg Avapritinib Groups compared to the placebo group. 
At C7D1, 24.8% of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (95% CI: 17.9, 32.8) vs 9.9% of patients in 
the Placebo Group (95% CI: 4.1, 19.3) achieved ≥ 50% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS. 
At C7D1, 45.4% of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (95% CI: 37.0, 54.0) vs 29.6% of patients in 
the Placebo Group (95% CI:19.3, 41.6) achieved ≥ 30% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS.  
The odds ratio (95% CI) calculated to compare the 25 mg Avapritinib Group with the Placebo Group was 
3.10 (1.24, 8.64) for the ≥ 50% reduction endpoint and 2.07 (1.08, 3.99) for the ≥ 30% reduction 
endpoint.  
Both odds ratios were statistically significant (1-sided p-value = 0.005 for ≥ 50% TSS reduction and 
0.009 for ≥ 30% TSS reduction).

•  Proportion of Patients with ≥ 50% reduction in objective measures of mast cell burden 
The proportion of patients who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in objective measures of mast cell burden from 
baseline to C7D1 were evaluated as key secondary endpoints. These measures included serum tryptase, 
KIT D816V MAF, and bone marrow mast cells.

Burden from Baseline to C7D1 (Part 2 ITT Population) 
Abbreviations: C7D1 = Cycle 7 Day 1; CI = confidence interval; EOS = end-of-study; ISM = indolent systemic mastocytosis; ITT = 
intent-to-treat; KIT = V-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog; MAF = mutant allele fraction; NE = not 
evaluable. a Odds ratio is to compare 25 mg avapritinib with placebo for each subgroup. b One-sided p-value is from Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test with controlling for randomization stratification factor (serum tryptase < 20 ng/mL vs. ≥ 20 ng/mL) and baseline ISM 
status (moderate vs. severe). Note: Patients who reached C7D1 or EOS prior to C7D1 with missing baseline or C7D1 assessment were 
counted in the denominator.  
The odds ratios between avapritinib and placebo were statistically significant for all 3 endpoints.  
Detailed results on the objective measures of mast cell burden are given below. 
Serum tryptase 
At C7D1, 53.9% of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (95% CI: 45.3, 62.3) vs. 0.0% of patients in 
the Placebo Group (95% CI: 0.0, 5.1) achieved ≥ 50% reduction in serum tryptase.  
Of note, 58 of 107 (54.2%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group with baseline serum tryptase ≥ 20 
ng/mL achieving a level of < 20 ng/mL (below the SM diagnosis criterion) at C7D1, with half of these 
patients (29/58) achieving a level of < 11.4 ng/mL (ULN), compared with 1 of the 50 (2.0%) patients in 
the Placebo Group with baseline serum tryptase ≥ 20 ng/Ml achieving a level of < 20 ng/mL at C7D1. 
KIT D816V MAF 
At C7D1, 67.8% of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (95% CI: 58.6, 76.1) vs. 6.3% of patients in 
the Placebo Group (95% CI: 1.8, 15.5) achieved either ≥ 50% reduction in KIT D816V MAF or became 
undetectable (< 0.02% LLD). This analysis was limited to patients with detectable mutations at baseline 
(LLD 0.02%). Of note, among 109 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group with detectable KIT D816V 
MAF at baseline, 12 (11.0%) had undetectable KIT D816V MAF at C7D1; in the Placebo Group, among 54 
patients with detectable KIT D816V MAF at baseline, 3 (5.6%) had undetectable KIT D816V MAF at C7D1. 
Additionally, 14/40 (35.0%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group with KIT D816V MAF ≥ 1% at 
baseline reduced to KIT D816V MAF < 1% at C7D1; in the Placebo Group, this was 0/22 patients. 
Bone marrow mast cells 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 102/179 
 
 
 
 
 
At C7D1, 52.8% of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (95% CI: 42.9, 62.6) vs. 22.8% of patients in 
the Placebo Group (95% CI: 12.7, 35.8) achieved ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow mast cells or no mast 
cell aggregates. This analysis was limited to patients with mast cell aggregates at baseline.  
Of note, in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 33/91 (36.3%) patients with bone marrow aggregates at 
baseline did not have bone marrow aggregates present at C7D1.  
In the Placebo Group, 6/50 (12.0%) patients with bone marrow aggregates at baseline did not have bone 
marrow aggregates present at C7D1. 
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints  
•  Change from Baseline to C7D1 objective measures of mast cell burden 
At C7D1, the mean (SD) change from baseline in serum tryptase was –26.02 (35.662) for the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and 9.65 (41.924) for the Placebo Group.  
At C7D1, the mean (SD) change from baseline in KIT D816V MAF was –1.178 (2.6978) for the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and 0.139 (0.9700) for the Placebo Group.  
At C7D1, the mean (SD) change from baseline in bone marrow mast cells was –3.3 (10.99) for the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and –2.0 (7.32) for the Placebo Group in the ITT population.  
•  Change in BSC usage for SM symptoms 
At baseline, 140 (99.3%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 71 (100.0%) patients in the 
Placebo Group were taking BSC. The most commonly used BSC medications were antihistamines for 
systemic use (97.2% in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 100.0% in the Placebo Group) and drugs for 
peptic ulcer and GERD (73.8% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 78.9% in the Placebo Group). By 
C7D1, 30 (21.3%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 9 (12.7%) patients in the Placebo Group 
had a reduction in the dose and/or frequency of BSC medications used. Four (2.8%) patients in the 25 
mg Avapritinib Group had complete discontinuation of their BSC medications. None of the patients in the 
Placebo Group had complete discontinuations of their BSC medications. A total of 11 (7.8%) patients in 
the Avapritinib Group and 8 (11.3%) patients in the Placebo Group had increases in the dose and/or 
frequency of BSC medications used. 
•  Change in lead (most severe) domain and lead (most severe) symptom 
The “lead” (most severe) domain (GI, skin, and neurocognitive domains) and symptom of the ISM-SAF 
were identified on a per patient basis using the domain/symptom with the highest score for that patient.  
At baseline, the most common lead (most severe) domain in both treatment groups was the skin domain 
reported in 46/71 (64.8%) patients in the Placebo Group and 76/139 (54.7%) patients in the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and the most common lead (most severe) symptom in both treatment groups was 
fatigue, reported in 59/139 (42.4%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 28/71 (39.4%) patients 
in the Placebo Group followed by spots reported in 31/139 (22.3%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group and 20/71 (28.2%) patients in the Placebo Group.  
Both, the most severe domain and the most severe symptom showed a statistically significant 
improvement in patients with ISM treated with avapritinib compared to patients treated with placebo; see 
table below.

Note: The “lead domain” refers to the domain with highest score at baseline in each patient. If patient has a tie with multiple lead 
domains, the average change from baseline for each domain is used for the summary. The “lead symptom” score refers to the individual 
symptom with highest score (individual symptoms were scored from 0-10) at baseline in each patient. If patient has a tie with multiple 
lead (most severe) symptoms, the average of change from baseline is used for the summary. 
•  Analysis of individual domains 
The GI, skin, and neurocognitive domain scores of the ISM-SAF reduced from baseline over time for both 
treatment groups. Among these domains, the difference between the 25 mg avapritinib group and 
placebo group was greatest for the skin domain scores. 
At C7D1, the mean (SD) change from baseline in the GI domain score for the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
was –3.74 (4.868) and –3.14 (4.664) for the Placebo Group. The difference (95% CI) between the groups 
was –0.60 (–2.03, 0.83) with a 2-sample t-test p-value of 0.410.  
At C7D1, the mean (SD) change from baseline in the skin domain score for the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
was –5.87 (6.485) and –2.64 (4.105) for the Placebo Group. The difference (95% CI) between the groups 
was –3.23 (–4.73, –1.73) with a 2-sample t-test p-value of < 0.0001.  
At C7D1, the mean (SD) change from baseline in the neurocognitive domain score for the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group was –4.03 (5.223) and -2.81 (4.285) for the Placebo Group. The difference (95% CI) 
between the groups was –1.22 (–2.69, 0.25) with a 2-sample t-test p-value of 0.102. 
•  Analysis of individual symptoms 
By C7D1, there were reductions in the mean individual symptom scores of the ISM-SAF for all symptom 
domains for both treatment groups. The reductions were greater for the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
compared to the Placebo Group across all the individual symptoms.  
For the individual symptom scores of the ISM-SAF, statistically significant differences in the mean change 
from baseline between the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and Placebo Group were seen at C7D1 in the 
following individual symptoms: spots severity, itching severity, and flushing severity.

•  Quality of life measures  
For all QoL measures (MC-QoL, PGIS, SF-12, PGIC, and EQ-5D-5L), a greater improvement was observed 
at Part 2 C7D1 in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group than the Placebo Group.

Population) 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints  
•  Change in anaphylaxis based on epinephrine use 
At baseline, 7 (5.0%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and none in the Placebo Group had 
anaphylaxis that required epinephrine treatment. Postbaseline, 2 (1.4%) patients in the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and 3 (4.2%) patients in the Placebo Group had anaphylaxis that required epinephrine 
treatment. 
•  Change in bone density 
A total of 78 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 33 patients in the Placebo Group had bone 
density scans at baseline. At C7D1, 50 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 23 patients in the 
Placebo Group had bone density scans. No trends were observed in the Z-scores. 
Part 3 of study BLU 285-2203  
In Part 3 of the study, all patients received 25 mg avapritinib.  
Long-term efficacy was assessed in the overall population (Part 1/2/3) using the avapritinib baseline (the 
last observation prior to the first dose of avapritinib in any part). 
•  Reduction in ISM-SAF TSS over time 
Over time there was a greater reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group as compared 
to the Placebo Group. An initial reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS was noted for both groups, consistent with 
regression to the means and placebo effect. In the Placebo Group, there was a reduction in the ISM-SAF 
TSS until Part 2 C3D1, consistent with an early placebo effect, followed by a plateau of the ISM-SAF TSS 
through Part 2 C7D1. After rollover to Part 3, for patients who rolled over from 25 mg avapritinib in Part

2, there was further reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS up to Part 3 C2D1 at which point the mean change in 
ISM-SAF TSS leveled off and remained stable through Part 3 C7D1. For patients who rolled over from 
placebo in Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3, the ISM-SAF TSS decreased through Part 3 C5D1 and 
stabilized through Part 3 C7D1.

Abbreviations: CXDX = Cycle X Day X, ISM-SAF = Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis-Symptom Assessment Form; LS Mean = Least 
Squares Mean; SE = Standard Error; TSS = Total symptom score.  
The overall Part 1/2/3 analyses, which analyzed efficacy using the avapritinib baseline for each group, 
showed a greater reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS in patients who had been in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
since Part 1 or Part 2 compared to patients who rolled over to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3 from placebo in 
Part 1 or 2 at all time points. At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), the mean (SD) change from 
baseline in the ISM-SAF TSS was –16.89 (16.744) points for the group of patients who rolled over from 
25 mg avapritinib in Part 1 or 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3 and –10.19 (13.948) for the patients who 
rolled over from placebo in Part 1 or 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3. These data show that with longer 
exposure there are further reductions in the ISM-SAF TSS. Indeed, for patients who had reached C13D1, 
additional small reductions in ISM-SAF TSS were seen. The mean (SD) change in ISMSAF TSS was –21.22 
(–19.018) for patients who rolled over from 25 mg avapritinib and –12.31 (–11.653) for patients who 
rolled over from placebo. 
Over time, for patients who rolled over from 25 mg avapritinib in Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3, 
the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS further increased until 
Part 3 C3D1 (≥ 50%) and C5D1 (≥ 30%) and then stabilized. For patients who rolled over from placebo 
in Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3, the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reduction in 
the ISM-SAF TSS increased through Part 3 C7D1. By Part 3 C7D1, a similar proportion of patients from 
both treatment groups had reached ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reductions in TSS.

At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), among the patients who rolled over from placebo in Part 1 or 
Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3 7/37 (18.9%) of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS 
which was similar to that reported in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group in Part 2. 
Among patients who rolled over from 25 mg avapritinib in Part 1 or Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3, 
39/151 (25.8%) had ≥ 50% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS. 
At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), among the patients who rolled over from placebo in Part 1 or 
Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3, 11/37 (29.7%) of patients had ≥ 30% reduction in the ISM-SAF 
TSS. Among patients who rolled over from 25 mg avapritinib in Part 1 or Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in 
Part 3, 71/151 (47.0%) had ≥ 30% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS. 
•  Reduction in objective measures of mast cell burden over time 
The reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS score over time in patients who rolled over from placebo in Part 1 or 
Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3 was supported by reductions over time in the objective measures of 
mast cell burden (tryptase, D816V MAF, percent bone marrow mast cells).  
Over time, a greater proportion of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group had ≥ 50% reduction in serum 
tryptase as compared to the Placebo Group. None of the patients in the Placebo Group had ≥ 50% 
reduction in serum tryptase in Part 2. After rollover to Part 3, among the patients who rolled over from 
placebo in Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3, the proportion of patients who had ≥ 50% reduction in 
serum tryptase increased sharply at Part 3 C2D1 reaching a plateau by Part 3 C4D1 that was maintained 
through Part 3 C7D1. A similar trend was observed for KIT D816V MAF, with a slower increase in the 
proportion of patients who reached a 50% reduction which appeared to increase with time through C7D1.

At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), 13/37 (35.1%) patients in the placebo to 25 mg group and 
81/151 (53.6%) patients in the 25 mg to 25 mg Avapritinib Group had ≥ 50% reduction in serum 
tryptase.  
At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), 13/30 (43.3%) patients in the placebo to 25 mg group and 
85/127 (66.9%) patients in the 25 mg to 25 mg Avapritinib Group had ≥ 50% reduction in (or 
undetected) KIT D816V MAF. 
At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), 1/30 (3.3%) patients in the placebo to 25 mg group and 55/116 
(47.4%) patients in the 25 mg to 25 mg Avapritinib Group had ≥ 50% reduction in (or no aggregates) 
bone marrow mast cells. 
•  PRO and QoL measures over time 
Improvements in QoL measures were observed over time in the patients who rolled over from placebo or 
25 mg avapritinib in Part 1 or Part 2 to 25 mg avapritinib in Part 3. 
At C7D1 (using the avapritinib baseline), patients treated with 25 mg avapritinib had improvements in all 
PRO and QoL measures and these improvements had deepened by 48 weeks (C13D1) of avapritinib 
treatment. 
At baseline, patients in both groups reported MC-QoL total scores in the high moderate severity range, on 
average. In Part 2, for the Placebo group the mean total score remained in the moderate severity range, 
while for the Avapritinib group there was a steady reduction in the mean total score over time, with C7D1 
scores reaching the mild disease severity range. After crossover to active treatment in Part 3, mean total 
scores for the Placebo group reached the mild disease severity range by C4D1.

Primary analysis: Mean change in ISM-SAF TSS 
The primary efficacy analysis set is the ITT population, which includes all 
randomized patients, independent of whether they received the study medication 
or not. All primary efficacy analyses are based on the ITT population. All patients 
in the ITT population are analyzed according to the avapritinib dose/placebo they 
were randomly assigned to receive and not according to what they actually 
received, if different.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This variation application is primarily supported by the results from part 2 of the pivotal study BLU-285-
2203 (PIONEER), a 3-part, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of avapritinib (BLU-285) in patients with ISM with symptoms inadequately controlled 
with standard therapy.  
Initially, patients with both ISM and smouldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) were planned to be 
included in study BLU-285-2203. However, no SSM patients were finally enrolled (in Part 2). This was 
justified by the MAH on the following grounds: that SSM patients have higher disease burden and are at 
higher risk of progression to advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM). The study protocol for part 2 was 
updated in this regard with amendment 4, and only ISM patients were included. This approach was 
considered acceptable.  
Forty-two sites in 13 countries enrolled patients and entered data for this study, including 19 sites in 
North America, 20 sites in Europe, and 3 sites in the United Kingdom. The European population is 
considered well represented with 119 (n=212; 56%) patients from European countries included in part 2 
of study BLU-285-2203. 
The focus for efficacy analyses in the current procedure is on patients with ISM treated with avapritinib at 
a dose of 25 mg QD. The proposal for a lower dose than the one recommended for the already approved 
indication in the AdvSM scenario seems reasonable in the context of a “non-aggressive/non-advanced" 
disease with the aim of downgrading toxicity and taking into consideration the (expected) long-term 
treatment. The RP2D was established based on Part 1 of the BLU 285-2203 study (see below).  
Overall, the proposed design of the study is considered adequate. The study is placebo-controlled. This is 
endorsed as there are no drugs specifically approved in the EU for patients with ISM, and current 
treatment of the disease is based on supportive care to control symptoms. A period of 24 weeks for the 
double-blinded placebo comparison can be accepted. Nevertheless, the interpretation of long-term 
efficacy data, which are considered of particular relevance in this indolent scenario, is hampered by the 
absence of a control arm in part 3 of the study. Further, the overall sample size of study BLU-285-2203 is 
limited, although this can be acknowledged taking into account the rarity of this disease. 
The primary endpoint for efficacy assessment in Part 2 of the study is defined as the mean change from 
baseline to cycle 7 day 1 (C7D1; week 24) in the total symptom score (TSS) using the Indolent Systemic 
Mastocytosis-Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF). The proposal to use a continuous variable for the 
primary efficacy assessment of symptom reduction is considered adequate.  
The ISM-SAF has been (recently) developed as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire. It 
assesses the severity of eleven items (bone pain, abdominal pain, nausea, spots on the skin, itching, 
flushing, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, headache and diarrhoea) which are graded on an 11-point 
numerical scale [from 0=no (sign/symptom) to 10=worst imaginable (sign/symptom)] using a 24-hour 
recall period. An additional item asks responders to record diarrhoea frequency during the prior 24 hours. 
The ISM-SAF can be scored at an item level or combined to create the above mentioned ‘Total Symptom 
Score’ (TSS) which is the sum of the 11 severity items ranged from 0 to 110. A ‘Gastrointestinal 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 121/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Symptom Score’, a ‘Skin Symptom Score’ and a ‘Neurocognitive Symptom Score’ can also be derived 
from data reported, which are scored from 0 to 30 (each of them). These scores can be calculated on a 
daily or a bi-weekly basis.  
The development and content validity as well as the psychometric properties of this PRO were discussed 
during 
regulatory 
interactions 
at 
EU 
level 
(EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III; 
EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/FU/1/2020/PA/SME/II).  At  that  time,  the  questionnaire  was  overall  regarded  as  an 
acceptable tool to quantitate efficacy in ISM.  
The proposed inclusion and exclusion criteria are overall considered reflective of a patient population with 
ISM  that  fail  to  achieve  control  under  symptomatic  therapies  and  have  remaining  moderate  to  severe 
symptomatology. An ISM-SAF TSS ≥28 was the pre-specified symptom severity threshold for the inclusion 
of patients in the study. This threshold was selected based on an observational study in 103 US patients 
diagnosed with ISM or SSM. Based on the findings  of both received operating characteristics (ROC) and 
contingency analyses, using the Patient Global Impression of Symptom Severity (PGIS) as an anchor, a bi-
weekly  ISM-SAF  TSS  cut-off  value  of  between  21  and  28  was  defined  to  identify  patients  with  at  least 
moderate symptoms. The upper value of 28 was selected by the MAH as a more conservative estimate. A 
similar  approach  was  used  to  identify  patients  with  severe  symptoms  for  whom  a  cut-off  of  ≥42  was 
selected. The proposed thresholds for inclusion in the study are considered basically acceptable.  
The original protocol for study BLU-285-2203 (dated 15 February 2018) was amended 10 times: 5 were 
global and 5 were country-specific amendments. The study methodology presented for assessment is in 
accordance with the latest global protocol amendment 9 (dated 07 June 2022). 
In the original protocol, the proposed primary endpoint was mean percent reduction in ISM-SAF TSS from 
baseline to week 12 (C4D1), which was then modified to mean change in ISM-SAF TSS from baseline to 
week 12 based on the feedback received from the FDA (amendment 1). In amendment 4 (15 June 2020), 
the  primary  endpoint  was  changed  to  the  proportion  of  avapritinib-treated  patients  with  ISM  achieving 
≥30% reduction in TSS from baseline to C7D1 (apparently, this change was agreed by the FDA). Later on, 
with amendment 9 (07 June 2022) the primary endpoint was changed, again, to mean change in ISM-SAF 
TSS from baseline to C7D1, compared to placebo (as discussed with the FDA).  
In addition, the sample size was increased in Part 2 (and consequently in Part 3) as a result of amendment 
4 and increased from 72 to 204 patients. 
Even if the finally agreed/selected primary endpoint as well as the sample size can be considered overall 
adequate  from  a  regulatory  perspective,  changes  have  been  implemented  during  an  ongoing  study  and 
therefore the MAH was requested to provide a detailed description on how these major changes should be 
expected  to  have  not  affected  the  integrity  and  the  internal  validity  of  the  study.  Overall,  the  protocol 
amendment 4 was made before the start of Part 2 of the study and therefore there was no impact on the 
integrity of the study. Regarding protocol amendment 9 the change in the primary endpoint was made prior 
to  the  last  patient  last  visit  for  Part  2  (21  Jun  2022)  while  the  study  was  blinded  and  therefore  with  no 
impact on the integrity of the study.  
Regarding major protocol deviations (reported in more than 2% of patients in part 2 of the study), there 
was  a  higher  rate  in  the  avapritinib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (29.9%  vs.  9.9%).  None  are 
thought to impact the integrity of the data.  
In 2018, the MAH sought advice (EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III) to ask about the appropriateness of 
the LOCF method to account for missing data. This method was strongly discouraged. The MAH followed 
the  EMA  advice  and,  in  the  final  protocol,  the  approach  was  changed  to  the  exclusion  of  patients  with 
missing values at baseline or C7D1 TSS from the analysis. As sensitivity analysis, Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) simulations to impute missing values at baseline or C7D1 was proposed. From a regulatory point 
of view, this is still not the preferred option to assess the agreed primary endpoint since the exclusion of

potential informative data from the primary efficacy analysis, i.e. intercurrent events (ICEs), might hamper 
the results and, consequently, their interpretation impacting the extrapolation of (the magnitude of) the 
treatment effect reported in the targeted population. Generally, the treatment policy estimand (where the 
value of the endpoint is used regardless of the occurrence of ICEs) is the strongly preferred strategy for 
the handling of these events. However, it is acknowledged that in some instances, the collection of these 
intercurrent events is not possible. For this reason, the MAH was requested to conduct additional analyses 
to better contextualise these results. Results of these analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Part 1 - Dose response study  
The main objective was to identify the optimal dose of avapritinib (RP2D) in patients with ISM.  
Baseline height and weight were similar across treatment groups. At baseline, all patients had significant 
sign and symptom burden as assessed by the ISM-SAF with a mean (SD) TSS of 53.3 (19.34). Baseline 
mean (SD) serum tryptase was 83.78 (100.530) ng/mL and 89.7% patients had bone marrow mast cell 
aggregates. KIT D816V mutation was detected in peripheral blood in 79.5% of patients at baseline with a 
mean (SD) allele fraction of 4.274 (8.4802). 
At C4D1, the mean (SD) reduction in TSS of the ISM-SAF was greater in all avapritinib groups compared 
with the placebo group: –12.54 (13.234) for the 25 mg group, –12.32 (14.194) for the 50 mg group, –
21.35 (18.769) for the 100 mg group, and –3.36 (7.998) for the placebo group.  
The 100 mg dose was associated with the greatest reduction in TSS at C4D1. However, additional 
analyses showed that the TSS reduction plateaued after C4D1. The 25 mg and 50 mg dose groups 
achieved a similar mean reduction in TSS to the 100 mg cohort by C7D1. 
Based on the above reported results from Part 1 of the study, 25 mg avapritinib was chosen as the RP2D 
for Part 2 and Part 3. The 25 mg cohort had a better safety profile in terms of Grade 3 AEs, required no 
dose modifications and no discontinuations of the study drug, with acceptable and comparable efficacy 
results and was expected by the MAH to allow long-term treatment. 
As  stated  above,  the  proposed  dose,  which  is  lower  than  that  recommended  for  the  already  approved 
indication  in  the  advanced  disease  setting  (i.e.  AdvSM),  is  considered  reasonable  in  a  “non-aggressive" 
scenario where downgrading toxicity is of importance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In Part 2, both the ITT and Safety Populations included 141 patients in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 
71 patients in the placebo group. The primary efficacy assessment was based on results reported in the 
ITT population.  
Regarding baseline characteristics, the ITT population included more females than males (70.9% vs. 
29.1% in the avapritinib arm and 76.1% vs. 23.9% in the placebo arm, for female and male patients, 
respectively). Literature is available suggesting a female predominance (Kanamori et al, 2015), which is 
consistent with the patient population enrolled in the study. Most patients in both groups were < 65 years 
(93.6% in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 84.5% in the placebo group), not Hispanic or Latino (70.2% 
in the 25 mg avapritinib group and 81.7% in the placebo group), and White (77.3% patients in the 25 mg 
avapritinib group and 85.9% patients in the placebo group), and other baseline characteristics (mean 
height [cm], weight [kg], and body mass index [kg/m2]) were similar in both groups. Of note, the 
proportion of female and white patients was higher in the placebo group. 
The mean ISM-SAF TSS at baseline (SD) was comparable for the placebo and the avapritinib arms, i.e. 
50.17 (19.145) points for the 25 mg avapritinib group and 52.43 (19.823) for the placebo group. Of note, 
while all patients seem to fulfil the eligibility criteria (eligibility TSS is defined as the 14-day average of 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 123/179 
 
 
 
 
TSS starting from the date that investigator deemed BSC medications are optimized and stabilised), there 
were some patients (14 in the avapritinib arm and 4 in the placebo arm) with a TSS < 28 at baseline. 
Indeed, the minimum ISM-SAF TSS value at baseline was 12.1 in the avapritinib arm and 18 in the 
placebo arm. The percentage of patients with severe symptoms of ISM (i.e. defined as an ISM-SAF TSS 
≥42) was balanced between the 25 mg avapritinib group (61.7%) and the placebo group (63.4%).  
Overall, the 94.3% rate of KIT D816V positivity was consistent with the anticipated ~95% rate of KIT 
D816V positivity noted in the ISM literature (Garcia-Montero et al, 2006; Jara-Acevedo et al, 2015; 
Ungerstedt et al, 2022). 
The majority of patients who received avapritinib (99.3%) or placebo (100%) received concomitant best 
supportive care at baseline (median of 3 therapies in the avapritinib group and 4 in the placebo group). 
The most common therapies in patients treated with avapritinib were H1 antihistamines (97.2%), H2 
antihistamines (66%), leukotriene inhibitors (34.8%) and cromolyn sodium (30.5%).  
Although cyto-reductive treatment is mainly indicated in advanced mastocytosis, several patients in the 
current study received treatment with midostaurin, imatinib, dasatinib, etc. In total, there were 19 
patients who had received prior therapy with TKIs before enrolment in the study (14 in the avapritinib 
arm and 4 in the placebo arm). However, according to the MAH limited information is available on the 
reasons for the previous treatment received but efficacy results for these patients have been provided 
and appear consistent with those of the overall population. 
The analysis of efficacy for avapritinib was based primarily on the results from the comparison between 
placebo and the RP2D of 25 mg avapritinib in Part 2 of study BLU 285-2203. During treatment, there was 
reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS for both groups. In the placebo group, a reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS was 
observed until C3D1 followed by a plateau of the ISM-SAF TSS through C7D1.  
At C7D1, the LS mean (SE) change from baseline in the ISM-SAF TSS was –15.58 (1.536) points for the 
25 mg avapritinib group and -9.15 (2.013) for the placebo group. Change from baseline to C7D1 in ISM-
SAF TSS showed a difference of -6.43 (95% IC: -10.90, -1.96) between treatment arms. This difference 
was statistically significant (p<0.003). It is noticeable that the regression to the mean observed in the 
placebo group is numerically larger than the estimated improvement seen with the addition of avapritinib.   
Results from the analysis of the primary endpoint in relevant subgroups were overall consistent with only 
two subgroups (male and patients with serum tryptase <20 ng/mL) apparently deriving less benefit from 
the experimental treatment (based on point estimates of mean change). These two subgroups are of 
small sample size and therefore results should be interpreted with caution.  
The results for the (key) secondary efficacy endpoints showed also statistically significant results. The 
proportion of patients with ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% reduction in ISM-SAF TSS from baseline to C7D1 was of 
24.8% vs. 9.9% and 45.4% vs 29.6% for the avapritinib and placebo groups, respectively. Also, the 
proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in objective measures of mast cell burden (serum tryptase, 
KIT D816V MAF and bone marrow mast cells) showed results in favour of avapritinib treatment with all 3 
endpoints reported as statistically significant.  
The clinically important difference (CID) between groups for the TSS (reported using the recently 
developed PRO ISM-SAF), derived using distribution-based methods, may range from 6 to 10. This is 
based on pooled data from Part 1 and 2 of study BLU 285-2203, considered by the MAH as confirmation 
of the CID range previously observed for Part 1 (i.e. from 7 to 10). However, the MAH was requested to 
further clarify/discuss the approach followed to inform this CID, including the fact that basically the same 
data were used for threshold determination as well as for final inference which constitute a limitation. 
Moreover, considering the data submitted from the mentioned analyses, a CID of 10 would appear a more 
conservative threshold. The CID range was generated using two independent distribution-based methods, 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 124/179 
 
 
 
 
based on a pooled analysis of Part 1 and Part 2 data at C7D1. The methods used to determine the range 
of values for a CID were pre-specified in the psychometric analysis SAP and the CID analysis was 
performed by an independent organisation using blinded data, which is reassuring. The MAH was 
requested to perform an anchor-based method. However, anchor-based methods were only used to 
establish thresholds of meaningful within patient change (responder analysis). In this regard, based on 
the anchor-based method a CID range for the ISM-SAF TSS was considered as clinically relevant. Thus, at 
a group level, patients receiving avapritinib experienced a change in TSS that can be considered of clinical 
relevance in contrast to those patients receiving placebo.  
Nevertheless, to assess whether between-group differences in ISM-SAF TSS values at C7D1 were 
clinically meaningful only distribution-based analyses were used. In addition to the above, similar 
concerns were identified in relation to the suitable threshold for the responder criterion in the primary 
endpoint, i.e. in terms of interpretation of the clinical relevance of reported statistically significant 
changes in within-patient score changes in the ISM-SAF TSS. Even if the argumentation that a 30% 
reduction in the TSS reflects a meaningful within-patient change (MWPC) can be followed, as it aligns 
with the treatment response criteria of ≥30% proposed by both European and American 
network/consortium, the relative change strongly depends not only on the absolute improvement but also 
on the baseline value of the included patients. Indeed, all patients included (albeit a few exceptions) had 
a baseline TSS above 28, according to the inclusion criteria, with a mean ISM-SAF TSS at baseline around 
50. Thus, the MAH was requested to provide the number of patients that achieved a TSS <28 as well as 
the proportion of patients with ≥30% reduction in ISM-SAF TSS from baseline to C7D1 that achieved a 
TSS<28. The proportion of patients with TSS<28 at C7D1 (week 24) was higher in the avapritinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm in the overall population (41.1% avapritinib vs 23.9% placebo) as well as 
in patients with moderate (60.5% vs 36.4%) and severe (26.4% vs 11.1%) symptoms. Moreover, the 
proportion of patients who achieved ≥30% reduction in TSS and a TSS<28 was also higher in the 
avapritinib arm (44/141 [31%] avapritinib vs 11/71 [15.5%] placebo). These results are supportive of 
the primary endpoint and its clinical relevance. 
The reported reduction in the dose and/or frequency of BSC medications used by C7D1 was higher in 
patients treated with avapritinib than in those receiving placebo, i.e. 30 (21.3%) and 9 (12.7%), 
respectively. Even though these observed trends to decreases of background therapy compared to 
placebo may not seem very compelling a further analysis of the primary endpoint with BSC as covariate 
and the results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Results have also been separately reported for the different ‘symptom domain clusters’ (GI, skin and 
neurocognitive) showing that the greatest effect apply to the skin symptoms. Indeed, a statistically 
significant difference was observed in the reduction of the mean skin domain scores between treatment 
arms (–5.87 and –2.64, for the avapritinib and placebo arms respectively; difference between the groups 
of -3.23). In contrast, the mean difference from baseline in the score for the GI and neurocognitive 
domains (-0.60 and -1.22, respectively) were lower and not statistically significant. Data from the 
analysis of individual symptoms are difficult to interpret but statistically significant differences in the 
mean change from baseline between the experimental and the placebo group at C7D1 were only seen in 
the spots severity, itching severity, and flushing severity domains/symptoms. Avapritinib is acknowledged 
to have beneficial effects across all ISM symptoms, since decreases in systemic measures of mast cell 
burden have been observed as well as improvements in all symptoms scores and domains, including 
improvement in most severe symptoms. Patients treated with avapritinib, to a greater or lesser extent, 
have shown a (higher) decrease in all individual symptoms and symptoms domains compared with 
placebo, although the highest effect is clearly observed in skin symptoms. Minor differences were 
observed in the GI domain but it was in fact the one with lower baseline scores. Besides, as pointed out 
by the MAH, results in other secondary endpoints of measure of mast cell burden also showed a beneficial 
effect with avapritinib.

The change in quality of life measures based on different scales/questionnaires (i.e. MC-QoL, PGIS, PGIC, 
SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L) was assessed as a secondary endpoint in part 2 of study BLU 285-2203. Results 
seem compatible with an improvement in QoL in avapritinib treated patients.  
Anaphylaxis is a common manifestation of disease in ISM. These episodes can be life threatening and are 
feared by patients who need to carry epinephrine auto-injectors at all times. The inclusion of an 
(exploratory) endpoint to compare the number of anaphylactic episodes, based on epinephrine use, is 
therefore welcome. At baseline, 7 (5.0%) patients in the avapritinib group and none in the placebo group 
had anaphylaxis that required epinephrine treatment. Post baseline, 2 (1.4%) and 3 (4.2%) patients in 
the avapritinib and placebo group, respectively, had anaphylaxis that required epinephrine treatment. The 
small sample size and the short duration of part 2 of the study limits the interpretation of this analysis.   
Part 3 – Long-term study 
Of the 202 patients that completed Part 2 of the study: 1 patient in the 25 mg avapritinib group 
completed Part 2 but did not roll over to Part 3. Thus, 201 patients completed Part 2 and rolled over to 
Part 3. Additionally, 34 patients from part 1 rolled over to part 3. In total, 235 patients rolled over to Part 
3 from Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. At the time of the initial data cut-off (23 June 2022), 14 patients 
have discontinued from Part 3 of the study and 221 patients are ongoing. 
At the time of the data cut-off (23 June 2022), mean (SD) treatment duration was almost twice as long in 
the Part 1/2/3 All 25 mg avapritinib group (10.41 months [7.167]) compared with patients in the 25 mg 
avapritinib group of Part 2. 
As expected, patients who were in the placebo group during Part 1 or Part 2 had higher mast cell burden 
than the patients who were in the avapritinib groups as assessed by serum tryptase and KIT D816V MAF 
levels at baseline (before starting part 3). 
The results from the long-term open-label Part 3 of the study and in the overall population (Part 1/2/3) 
submitted seemingly show that the efficacy of avapritinib is maintained beyond C7D1, though 
interpretation of these data is hampered by the open label nature of this part of the study. Of note, the 
observed improvement in the ISM-SAF TSS and objective measures of mast cell burden, in patients 
previously treated with avapritinib who rolled over to avapritinib in part 3, are considered supportive.  
Updated efficacy data based on a data cut-off (DCO) date of 07 April 2023 were submitted during the 
procedure. At the time of this DCO, of the 234 patient who rollover to Part 3, 24 had discontinued study 
and 211 were ongoing. Results at 48 weeks show an improvement in mean change of TSS and in the 
proportion of patients achieving ≥50% and ≥30% reduction in TSS compared with the assessment at 24 
weeks. Regarding objective markers of mast cell burden, a decrease in the proportion of patients with a 
≥50% reduction in serum tryptase and the proportion of patients with a ≥50% reduction in KIT D816V 
MAF was observed. No updated data on bone marrow mast cells have been provided since bone marrow 
biopsy was optional at week 48 and few patients have results. QoL was overall maintained at 48 weeks. 
The number of patients with a decrease in the use of BSC medications was higher at week 48 than at 
week 24 (47 [31.1%] patients vs. 38 [25.2%] patients, respectively). However, no additional patients 
discontinued BSC medications (4 patients). 
Overall, the efficacy of avapritinib appears to be maintained with a longer follow-up although a decrease 
in the proportion of patients with response in mast cell burden is observed. Since Part 3 is intended to 
continue for up to 5 years, a commitment to submit results of Part 3 of the study annually was required. 
The MAH has committed to submit an annual report of study BLU-285-2203 starting in August 2024 and 
continuing annually until completion of the study as a Post Authorisation Measure (REC).  
Of note, with protocol amendment 7 the possibility to increase the dose from 25 mg QD to 50 mg QD in 
Part 3 of the study was included. Nevertheless, no patient in Part 3 had escalated to 50 mg at the time at 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023

the initial data cut-off date (i.e. 23 June 2022).  Up to the new data cut-off (07 April 2023) 10 patients 
had dose escalated to 50 mg. Among patients who dose escalated, TSS improved in the majority of 
patients (in 2 patients TSS was stable or even increased and for 1 patient no information is provided). 
Trypsase and KITD816V VAF decreased in all patients in which it was assessed (8 and 5, respectively).  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data show a statistically significant reduction in the mean change from baseline to C7D1 (week 
24) in the total symptom score (TSS) using the Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis-Symptom Assessment 
Form (ISM-SAF). The (key) secondary efficacy endpoints also show statistically significant results. The 
efficacy of avapritinib appears to be maintained in the long term although the interpretation of the data is 
hampered by the absence of a control arm in Part 3 of the study.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- Since the study BLU-285-2203 is intended to continue for up to 5 years, the MAH has committed to 
submit an annual report until completion of the study following recommendation from the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety database to support the proposed extension of indication consists of a single, phase II, placebo-
controlled  study  in  patients  with  ISM  (study  BLU-285-2203).  Study BLU-285-2203  is  a  3-part,  Phase 2, 
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  comparing  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  avapritinib  in 
combination with BSC to placebo in combination with BSC in patients with ISM whose symptoms were not 
adequately controlled by BSC. 
Safety  data  focuses  on  ISM  patients  treated  with  avapritinib  25 mg  QD  or  placebo  in  Part 2  of 
Study BLU-285-2203. In addition, overall safety data, assessed across all 3 study parts, including patients 
who received any dose of avapritinib in any part of the study are included.  
The data cut-off date for the submission was 23/06/2022. As part of the responses to the CHMP’s D120 
LOQ, the MAH submitted a safety update (new data cut-off date 07/04/2023) for part 3 of 
study BLU-285-2203.

Safety data have been presented separately for Part 2 (placebo-controlled) of study BLU-285-2203 and the 
overall safety database (all ISM patients included in the study). 
Patient exposure 
The  safety  population  included  246  patients  who  have  received  at  least  1  dose  of  avapritinib 
(“All Avapritinib” Group): 
•  Part 1 (completed): Identified the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), it included 39 patients 
(placebo: 9; avapritinib 25mg: 10; avapritinib 50mg: 10; avapritinib 100mg: 10), with a median 
treatment duration  of 15 to 20 weeks. 
•  Part 2 (completed): ISM patients were randomly assigned to the avapritinib 25mg QD in 
combination with BSC (141 patients) or to placebo in combination with BSC (71 patients), with a 
treatment duration of 24 weeks. 
•  Part 3 (on-going): an open label extension cohort in which patients that participated in Part 1 or 2 
could join and receive the avapritinib intended dose (25mg QD) with an overall treatment duration of 
up to 5 years (including Parts 1 and 2). A total of 235 patients have enrolled, including 34 patients 
from Part 1 and 201 patients who rolled over from Part 2. 
A total of 226 patients who only received the 25 mg dose comprise the “All 25 mg Avapritinib” Group. Of 
them, 151 patients had received 25 mg avapritinib in Part 1 or Part 2 (and Part 3 if they rolled over), and 
75 patients  had  received  placebo  in  Part 1  or  Part 2  and  25 mg  avapritinib  in  Part 3.  Additionally, 
10 patients each had received avapritinib 50 mg and 100 mg in Part 1 prior to rollover to 25 mg in Part 3.

•  Disposition 
In  Part  2  of  the  study,  5  patients  in  the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group  discontinued  from  the  study  due  to: 
withdrawal of consent (n=2), AE (n=1), SM clinical progression (n=1), and investigator’s decision (n=1). 
In  the  Placebo  Group,  5  patients  discontinued  due  to:  withdrawal  of  consent  (n=3)  and  other  reasons 
(n=2).

A total of 136 patients (96.5%) treated with 25 mg avapritinib and 66 patients (93.0%) treated with placebo 
completed Part 2 of the study. Of these, 1 patient in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group completed Part 2 but did 
not roll over to Part 3.  
Overall, 235 patients rolled over to Part 3 from Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. At the time of the data cutoff 
for  the  updated  data  (07  April  2023),  24  patients  have  discontinued  from  Part  3  of  the  study  and  211 
patients are ongoing (Figure 47).

Concomitant Medications 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203: 
The  majority  of  patients  who  had  prior  treatment  with  cytoreductive  therapies  such  as  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors for mastocytosis had 1 prior line of therapy: 19.1% patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 
18.3% patients in the Placebo Group. A few patients in both groups had 2 to 3 prior lines of mastocytosis 
therapy. The most commonly reported concomitant BSC medication/therapies included medications such 
as proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers, antihistamines for systemic use, leukotriene inhibitors and anti-
IgE antibodies, intestinal anti-inflammatory agents such as oral cromolyn, and corticosteroids for systemic 
use. Most commonly reported concomitant BSC medication/therapies included drugs for peptic ulcer and 
gastrooesophageal reflux disease (12.1% and 12.7%), antihistamines for systemic use (10.6% and 9.9%), 
intestinal anti-inflammatory agents (10.6% and 7.0%), corticosteroids for systemic use (9.9% and 2.8%), 
and other systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases (6.4% and 4.2%). 
The  majority  of  patients  in  the  Part  2  safety  population  received  concomitant  medication/therapy  other 
than BSC (97.9% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 100% in the Placebo Group). The use of concomitant 
medications by WHO drug classification ATC class 3 was similar between the treatment groups. The most 
common concomitant medication/therapies used were viral vaccine (43.3% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group 
and 43.7% in the Placebo Group), other analgesics and antipyretics (36.2% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group

and 35.2% in the Placebo Group). Antidepressants and anxiolytic medications were also used often (19.1% 
and 16.3% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 21.1% and 22.5% in the Placebo Group, respectively). The 
use of opioids was similar between the 2 groups: 22.0% in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 22.5% in the 
Placebo Group.  
Overall Avapritinib Population 
Prior mastocytosis therapy, concomitant BSC medication, and use of concomitant medication other than 
BSC for the Overall Avapritinib Population (Part 1/2/3) which included patients who rolled over to Part 3 
from Parts 1 and 2 were consistent with the use of these medications/therapies in Part 2.

Common Adverse Events  
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  across  both  groups  (≥ 10%)  included  headache,  nausea,  COVID-19, 
dizziness,  and  diarrhea.  Of  these  events,  COVID-19  and  dizziness  had  a  slightly  higher  incidence  in  the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group compared to the Placebo Group.

Adverse Events by Severity 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
Most of the patients experienced Grade 1 or 2 AEs in both treatment groups.  
In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 48 patients (34.0%) experienced Grade 1 AEs, 50 patients (35.5%) had 
Grade  2  AEs,  28 patients  (19.9%)  had  Grade 3  AEs,  and  2 patients  (1.4%)  had  Grade 4  AEs.  In  the 
Placebo Group,  15 patients  (21.1%)  experienced  Grade 1  AEs,  36 patients  (50.7%)  had  Grade 2  AEs, 
15 patients (21.1%) had Grade 3 AEs, and no patients had Grade 4 AEs.  
In  the  25 mg Avapritinib Group,  1 patient  experienced  a  Grade 4  event  of  acute  myeloid  leukaemia 
associated with a Grade 4 event of neutrophil count decreased, both were assessed as not related to study 
drug  by  the  Investigator.  The  other  Grade 4  event  was  hypokalaemia  that  occurred  in  a  patient  with  a 
medical history of intermittent diarrhoea and was assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 140/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most commonly reported Grade 3 event was anaphylactic reaction, reported in 4 patients (2.8%); the 
event was assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator in all 4 patients. Anaphylactic reaction 
is  a  common  clinical  manifestation  of  ISM.  All  other  Grade 3  AEs  were  reported  in  1  or  2 patients.  Most 
Grade 3 AEs were assessed as not related by the Investigator. The only related Grade 3 AEs were blood 
alkaline phosphatase increased, disturbance in attention, and neutrophil count decreased, all reported in 
1 patient (0.7%) each. 
In the Placebo Group, the most commonly reported Grade 3 event was anaphylactic reaction in 3 patients 
(4.2%) and was assessed as not related to study drug in all cases. All other Grade 3 AEs were reported in 
1  or  2 patients  each.  Most  of  the  Grade 3  AEs  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator. The only related Grade 3 AEs were headache, diarrhea, and anxiety, all reported in 1 patient 
(1.4%) each. 
Overall Avapritinib Population 
Of  the  226 patients  in  the  25 mg Avapritinib  Group,  86 patients  (38.1%)  experienced  Grade ≥3  AEs. 
Grade ≥3 anaphylactic reaction AEs were reported in 12 patients (5.3%), in all cases they were assessed 
as not related to study drug by the Investigator. Grade ≥3 hypertension AEs were reported in 10 patients 
(4.4%). The types and incidences of AEs by severity grade in the All Avapritinib Group were similar to those 
in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group and no trends or concerns were identified. 
In the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, most of the patients experienced Grade 1 or Grade 2 AEs (Table 69). 
An increase of ≥ 10% compared with the original submission was noted for Grade ≥3 AEs (25.7% vs 38.1%), 
however  the  incidence  of  related  Grade  ≥3  AEs  remained  similar  to  what  was  reported  in  the  original 
submission (2.7% vs 4.9%). One new related SAE and one not related death were reported in the update 
period.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
In  the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group,  the  SOC  in  which  most  patients  experienced  AEs  was  Nervous  System 
Disorders  (54 patients  [38.3%]),  followed  by  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (52  patients  [36.9%]).  In  the 
Placebo  Group,  these  were  also  the  most  common  SOCs  (24  patients  [33.8%]  and  27  [38.0%], 
respectively). This likely reflects the burden of the underlying disease. 
The SOC in which most patients experienced SAEs was Infections and Infestations (2 patients [1.4%]) in 
the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group,  and  Infections  and  Infestations  (3  patients  [4.2%])  and  Immune  System 
Disorders  (2  patients  [2.8%])  in  the  Placebo  Group.  In  other  SOCs,  only  1 patient  each  experienced  an 
SAE. None of the SAEs were assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator. 
The  SOC  in  which  patients  had  dose  reductions  were  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  General  Disorders  and 
Administration Site Conditions, and Nervous System Disorders in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and Nervous 
System Disorders in the Placebo Group. All were reported in 1 patient each and the event in the Nervous 
System Disorders SOC (memory impairment) was assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator in 
both patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and the Placebo Group. 
The SOC in which most patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group had AEs leading to permanent study drug 
discontinuation was Nervous System Disorders (2 patients [1.4%]). The events were assessed as related 
to study drug by the Investigator in both patients. In other SOCs, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
were assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator and were reported by 1 patient each. In the 
Placebo  Group,  1  patient  (1.4%)  experienced  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  3  SOCs  (Gastrointestinal 
Disorders, General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, and Nervous System Disorders), that were 
all assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator.

Note: AEs are coded using MedDRA version 25.0. All AEs are Treatment Emergent AEs. A patient is counted only once 
for multiple events within the same SOC.  
The most common SOCs (in ≥ 10% of patients) with AEs that were assessed as related to study drug by 
the Investigator were the following: 
In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group: 
•  Nervous  System  Disorders  (23 patients  [16.3%]);  mainly  headache  (11 patients  [7.8%])  and 
dizziness (4 patients [2.8%]), all others in 1 or 2 patients each. 
•  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (21 patients  [14.9%]);  mainly  oedema 
peripheral (9 patients [6.4%]), fatigue (6 patients [4.3%]), and face oedema (5 patients [3.5%]), 
all others in 1 or 2 patients each. The majority of these events were Grade 1 and there were no 
SAEs. 
•  Eye  Disorders  (19 patients  [13.5%]);  mainly  periorbital  oedema  (9 patients  [6.4%]  and  eyelid 
oedema (5 patients [3.5%], all others in 1 or 2 patients each. 
•  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders  (19 patients  [13.5%]);  mainly  alopecia  (5 patients 
[3.5%]), hair colour change (4 patients [2.8%]), and photosensitivity reaction (4 patients [2.8%]), 
all others in 1 or 2 patients each. 
•  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (18 patients  [12.8%]);  mainly  nausea  (9 patients  [6.4%]),  diarrhoea 
(4 patients [2.8%]), and dry mouth (3 patients [2.1%]), all others in 1 patient each. 
• 
Investigations  (16 patients  [11.3%]);  mainly  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased  (5 patients 
[3.5%]),  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (4 patients  [2.8%]),  alanine  aminotransferase 
increased (3 patients [2.1%]), and blood lactate dehydrogenase increased (3 patients [2.1%]), all 
others in 1 or 2 patients each. The majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2 and there were no 
SAEs. 
In the Placebo Group: 
•  Nervous System Disorders (15 patients [21.1%]); mainly headache (7 patients [9.9%]), and 
dizziness (5 patients [7.0%]), all others in 1 or 2 patients each. 
•  Eye Disorders (9 patients [12.7%]); mainly periorbital oedema, eye pain, and vision blurred 
(2 patients [2.8%] each), all others in 1 patient each. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 145/179 
 
 
 
 
•  Gastrointestinal Disorders (8 patients [11.3%]); mainly nausea (6 patients [8.5%]), all others in 
1 or 2 patients each. 
•  Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (8 patients [11.3%]); mainly alopecia (3 patients 
[4.2%]), all others in 1 patient each. 
In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 3 patients (2.1%) experienced Grade 3 AEs assessed as related to study 
drug by the Investigator. These were in the SOCs Investigations (blood alkaline phosphatase increased and 
neutrophil count decrease) and Nervous System Disorders (disturbance in attention). In the Placebo Group, 
2 patients (2.8%) experienced a total of 3 Grade 3 AEs assessed as related by the Investigator. These were 
in the SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders (diarrhoea), Nervous System Disorders (headache), and Psychiatric 
Disorders (anxiety). All other AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator were Grade 1 or 2. 
Overall Avapritinib Population 
In the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, the SOC in which most patients experienced AEs was Infections and 
Infestations  (155 patients  [68.6%]),  followed  by  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (117  patients  [51.8]).  These 
were similar with the observations in the All Avapritinib Group. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences 
were observed as compared to Part 2 of the study.

Overall Avapritinib Population 
The most commonly reported SAEs, anaphylactic reaction (1.8%) reported in 4 patients and mastocytosis 
(0.9%) reported in 3 patients, occur frequently in patients with ISM. All other events were reported in ≤2 
patients each and no trends were observed (Table 75). One new SAE, Grade 3 oedema peripheral, assessed 
by the Investigator as related to study drug was reported in the update period ( 07 April 2023). The patient 
later resumed with reduced dose with no further worsening of the edema.

Other Significant Adverse Events 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The AESIs include intracranial bleeding (ICB) and cognitive effects.  
Intracranial bleeding 
There were no ICB events reported in the study up to the latest cut-off date. 
Cognitive Effects 
Patients  with  ISM  typically  have  a  higher  incidence  of  neurocognitive  symptoms  related  to  underlying 
disease (Gülen et al, 2016) compared to the general population.  
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203: 
The incidence of cognitive effect AEs was slightly lower in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (4 patients [2.8%]) 
than  in  the  Placebo Group  (3 patients  [4.2%]).  The  most  commonly  reported  event  was  memory 
impairment,  in  2 patients  (1.4%)  in  the  25 mg Avapritinib Group  and  1 patient  (1.4%)  in  the 
Placebo Group.  Amnesia  and  mood  altered  occurred 
in  1 patient 
(0.7%)  each 
in 
the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group, and mental impairment and mental status changes occurred in 1 patient (1.4%)

each in the Placebo Group. Most of the AEs were Grade 1 in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group with only 1 patient 
experiencing a Grade 2 AE (memory impairment). In the Placebo Group, 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 
event, which was reported as serious (mental status changes); all other events were reported as Grade 1 
events.  None  of  the  events  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  in  either  treatment  group  and  1 patient  in 
each group experienced events leading to dose reduction (These data indicate that treatment with 25 mg 
avapritinib is not associated with an increased risk of cognitive effects in patients with ISM.

Overall Avapritinib Population 
In the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, a total of 15 patients (6.6%) experienced cognitive effect AEs through 
the update period. These were assessed as related to study drug in 7 patients (3.1%). The most commonly 
reported  event  through  the  update  period  was  memory  impairment  in  9 patients  (4.0%)  and  cognitive 
disorders in 3 patients (1.3%) through the update period and all other events were reported in 1 patient 
each. In the  All Avapritinib Group, other than the  patients  already reported in the All 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group, there were no additional patients who experienced cognitive effects during the update period.

Laboratory findings 
Serum Chemistry 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
An  initial  and  transient  increase  in  ALP  (mean  within  the  normal  ranges)  was  noted  in  the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group. This was observed initially with its peak at C2D1 returning to baseline by C6D1. 
This  transient  increase  in  ALP  was  possibly  due  to  lysis  of  mast  cells  infiltrating  the  bone  and  was  not 
considered clinically meaningful.

Liver Function Tests 
There were no patients that met the criteria for potential Hy’s law defined as post-baseline total bilirubin 
elevation to ≥ 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) occurring on or within 30 days after a post-baseline ALT or 
AST elevation to ≥ 3x ULN and concurrent ALP is < 2x ULN. 
A limited number of patients had bilirubin elevation ≥ 2x ULN. These were generally not associated with 
ALT/AST increase and ALP values were within normal ranges, which doesn’t suggest a clinically 
meaningful cholestasis. All patients had confounding factors including Gilbert’s syndrome, ongoing 
medical history of increase in bilirubin levels, cholelithiasis or dyslipidemia. Relevant AEs were reported in 
3 patients, all assessed as not related to study drug, and resolved while receiving continued treatment 
with avapritinib.

Coagulation 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
AEs associated with coagulation were activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged and blood fibrinogen 
decreased in 1 (0.7%) patient each in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group; both AEs were nonserious. The AE of 
activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  prolonged  was  assessed  as  not  related  to  avapritinib  by  the 
Investigator and the AE of blood fibrinogen decreased was assessed as related to avapritinib. 
Overall Avapritinib Population 
Apart from the AEs associated with coagulation reported in Part 2, a Grade 1 non-serious AE of activated 
partial thromboplastin time prolonged was reported in one patient in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group. The 
event  was  assessed  as  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  No  additional  AEs  associated  with 
coagulation were reported in the All Avapritinib Group.  
With  the  most  recent  data  cut-off,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  over  time 
observed in coagulation parameters of activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and prothrombin 
international normalized ratio, and prothrombin time across groups through the update period. 
Vital sign measurements 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 154/179 
 
 
 
 
There were few clinically significant abnormalities reported as AEs associated with vital signs parameters, 
and they were similar between the two treatment groups. In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group the following AEs 
were  reported,  hypertension  in  6  (4.3%)  patients,  weight  increased  in  4  (2.8%)  patients,  and  weight 
decreased,  hypotension,  and  orthostatic  hypotension  in  1 (0.7%)  patient  each.  In  the  Placebo Group, 
hypertension  was  reported  in  5 (7.0%)  patients,  weight  increased  in  3  (4.2%)  patients,  and  weight 
decreased  in  1  (1.4%)  patient.  All  AEs  associated  with  vital  signs  parameters  were  nonserious  for  the 
patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, and 1 patient reported an SAE of hypertension (unrelated) in the 
Placebo Group. The AEs of hypertension and weight increased in 1 patient each were assessed as related 
to  avapritinib  by  the  Investigator;  and  the  AEs  of  weight  increased  in  2  patients  and  hypertension  in 
1 patient were assessed as related in the Placebo Group. 
Overall Avapritinib Population (initial submission) 
AEs associated with vital signs parameters were hypertension in 19 (8.4%) patients, weight increased in 
11  (4.9%)  patients,  weight  decreased  in  4  (1.8%)  patients,  hypotension  in  2  (0.9%)  patients,  and 
orthostatic  hypotension,  blood  pressure  increased,  and  prehypertension  in  1 (0.4%)  patient  each  in  the 
All 25 mg Avapritinib  Group.  All  AEs  associated  with  vital  signs  parameters  were  nonserious  in  the 
All 25 mg Avapritinib  Group.  The  AEs  of  weight  increased  in  5  patients,  hypertension  in  2 patients,  and 
blood pressure increased, and weight decreased in 1 patient each were assessed as related to avapritinib 
by the Investigator. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
One patient each in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group had QTcF > 480 msec and > 500 msec compared to no 
patients in the Placebo Group. Overall, 10 patients (7.1%) in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 5 patients 
(7.9%)  in  the  Placebo Group  had  a  QTcF  increase  of  > 30 msec  from  baseline.  An  increased  QTcF 
> 60 msec from baseline was reported in 3 (2.1%) patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and none in the 
Placebo Group. It should be noted that a QTcF > 480 msec was an exclusion criterion for the study (as of 
Amendment 2). All patients with > 60 msec increase from baseline were female. QTcF was > 500 msec in 
1 of the patients and was not associated with any relevant AEs. In the remaining 2 patients, QTcF didn’t 
increase beyond 470 msec which is considered to be within the upper normal range in female patients and 
therefore considered not clinically meaningful.  
AEs associated with ECG findings were electrocardiogram QT prolonged in 2 patients and electrocardiogram 
T wave inversion in 1 patient in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group; electrocardiogram QT prolonged in 1 patient 
in the Placebo Group. All AEs were nonserious. The AEs of electrocardiogram QT prolonged were of severity 
Grade 3 (unrelated) and Grade 1 (related), and electrocardiogram T wave inversion was Grade 1 (related), 
all reported in 1 patient each in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group. The AE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
was Grade 2, and not related to study drug by the Investigator.  
A search of the AE dataset was performed using the PTs from the SMQ Torsade de pointes/QT Prolongation. 
The search revealed 3 patients (2.1%) in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the Placebo 
Group  who  experienced  events  within  the  SMQ.  The  reported  events  included  electrocardiogram  QT 
prolonged (2 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 1 patient in the Placebo Group) and syncope (2 
patients  in  the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group).  None  of  the  events  were  serious.  One  patient  with  a  medical 
history of intermittent dizziness experienced a Grade 3 syncope assessed as not related to study drug. The 
event  was  not  associated  with  QT  prolongation  at  the  time  of  the  occurrence.  The  patient  continued 
treatment  with  no  new  episodes  reported.  Syncope,  Grade  1  in  severity,  was  not  associated  with  QT 
prolongation in the other patient either. It is important to note that patients with ISM frequently suffer from 
mast cell mediator related symptoms that include syncope. Patients with QT prolongation reported as AEs 
are described above.

Overall Avapritinib Population (initial submission) 
Overall, 2 patients in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group had QTcF > 480 msec and 1 patient had > 500 msec 
(described  in  Part  2).  In  the  All  25 mg Avapritinib Group,  24  patients  (10.6%)  had  a  QTcF  increase  of 
> 30 msec from baseline. An increased QTcF > 60 msec from baseline was reported in 6 patients (2.7%) 
in this group.  
AEs associated with ECG findings were limited and included electrocardiogram QT prolonged in 4 patients, 
and electrocardiogram QRS complex prolonged and electrocardiogram T wave inversion in 1 patient each 
in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group. Except for 1 AE of Grade 3, nonserious, electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
(unrelated),  all  other  AEs  were  nonserious,  Grade 1,  and  assessed  as  related  to  avapritinib  by  the 
Investigator. 
The  search  using  SMQ  Torsade  de  pointes/QT  Prolongation  revealed  8  patients  overall  who  experienced 
events in Part 1/2/3. In addition to the 6 patients described above in Part 2 results, 5 patients experienced 
events in the All Avapritinib Group. 3 of them occurred while on Part 3. Of these, 2 patients had received 
Placebo prior to 25 mg Avapritinib in Part 3: 1 experienced a Grade 1 loss of consciousness assessed as 
not related by the Investigator with no ECG abnormalities findings, the other patient experienced a Grade 
1 QT prolonged event described above; one patient experienced a Grade 3 syncope assessed as not related 
by the Investigator and had no QT prolongation findings in the ECG results. None of the events were serious 
and all resolved with continued treatment. 2 out of 5 patients experienced events within the SMQ during 
Part 1: one patient experienced a Grade 3 syncope while receiving 25 mg avapritinib, which resolved with 
continued treatment, was assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator and patient had QTcF 
within the normal ranges at the time of reported event; the remaining patient experienced a Grade 1 QT 
prolonged AE while receiving 100 mg avapritinib, assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator. 
None of the events were serious. 
ECOG Performance Status 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
Most patients (> 90%) had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 in both treatment groups; and 
10  (7.1%)  patients  in  the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group  and  4  (5.6%)  patients  in  the  Placebo  Group  had  a 
baseline ECOG performance status of 2. There were no shifts to ECOG performance status of 4 and only 1 
shift to an ECOG performance status of 3 in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group during Part 2 of the study. 
Overall Avapritinib Population (initial submission) 
Overall, most patients (> 90%) had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, 17 (7.5%) patients had 
2 in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group. Shifts to an ECOG performance status of 3 or higher were uncommon. 
Most patients maintained their baseline score, with some patients shifting to a score of 0 or 1. 
Brain Imaging Assessment (initial submission) 
Brain imaging was performed at screening and patients with baseline abnormalities indicative of risk for 
intracranial haemorrhage, or prior, recent, or current intracranial haemorrhage, were excluded from the 
study.  One  patient  in  the  25 mg Avapritinib Group  had  abnormal  brain  imaging  findings  at  Part 1  C5D1, 
that was assessed as related to sinusitis. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
Subgroup analyses of AEs were performed for intrinsic factors of age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years), sex (female, 
male), baseline ISM status (moderate, severe), baseline serum tryptase (< 20 ng/mL, ≥ 20 ng/mL), and 
Assessment report

extrinsic  factors  of  region  (North  America,  Europe),  number  of  baseline  BSC  therapies  (<  4,  ≥  4),  prior 
cytoreductive therapy (yes, no), and baseline opioid use (yes, no). 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
Treatment with avapritinib 25 mg was not associated with an increase in the probability of having an AE in 
the subgroups of age, sex, baseline serum tryptase, baseline cytoreductive therapy and baseline opioids, 
as compared with placebo (odds ratio < 1.0) (Figure 49). A higher probability of experiencing AEs occurred 
with avapritinib treatment for patients with severe baseline ISM status, number of baseline BSC ≥ 4, and 
in  the  North  America  region  (odds  ratio  >  1);  however,  none  of  these  comparisons  were  statistically 
significant. Because the odds ratio for the North America region only just exceeded 1 (odds ratio 1.04), and 
no relevant trends were seen compared with Europe, this analysis is not considered further. 
The majority of the patients were female (76.9%), < 65 years of age (87.2%), White (92.3%), and not 
Hispanic  and  Latino  (89.7%),  therefore  analyses  of  AEs  by  subgroups  based  on  these  factors  are  not 
informative.  The  main  differences  observed  between  25  mg  avapritinib  and  placebo  in  the  subgroup 
analyses of baseline ISM status and number of baseline BSC therapies are summarized below.

logistic regression with placebo as the reference category. – represents odds ratios and p-values that were not 
estimable due to quasi-complete separation. An odds ratio of > 1 indicates that treatment with avapritinib is favored.  
Baseline ISM Status 
Compared with placebo, an increase in the probability of having an AE with 25 mg avapritinib was observed 
in  patients  with  severe  ISM  (odds  ratio  =  1.32).  In  patients  with  severe  ISM,  this  difference  in  favor  of 
placebo was accounted for mainly by higher incidences of AEs with 25 mg avapritinib in the SOCs of: 
Nervous System Disorders (placebo 35.6%, 25 mg avapritinib 41.4%, not on account of any specific 
types of AEs) 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 157/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (placebo  31.1%,  25 mg  avapritinib  40.2%,  mostly  on  account  of 
diarrhoea and constipation) 
Eye Disorders (placebo 15.6%, 25 mg avapritinib 24.1%, mostly on account of periorbital oedema 
and eyelid oedema) 
Investigations (placebo 20.0%, 25 mg avapritinib 27.6%, mostly on account of liver transaminases) 
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (placebo 6.7%, 25 mg avapritinib 17.2%, mostly on account of 
hypokalaemia, decreased appetite, iron deficiency, fluid retention, and hypophosphataemia) 
Psychiatric Disorders (placebo 4.4%, 25 mg avapritinib 13.8%, mostly on account of anxiety and 
insomnia) 
Conversely, in the following SOCs, higher incidences of AEs occurred with 25 mg avapritinib in patients with 
moderate ISM, but not in patients with severe ISM:  
Infections and Infestations (placebo 15.4%, 25 mg avapritinib 34.6%, mostly on account of COVID-
19, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection) 
Number of Baseline BSC Therapies 
Compared with placebo, an increase in the probability of having an AE with 25 mg avapritinib was observed 
in patients with ≥ 4 BSC medications at baseline (odds ratio = 1.29). In patients with ≥ 4 BSC at baseline, 
this  difference  in  favor  of  placebo  was  accounted  for  mainly  by  higher  incidences  of  AEs  with  25 mg 
avapritinib in the SOCs of: 
Nervous  System  Disorders  (placebo  33.3%,  25 mg  avapritinib  43.5%,  mostly  on  account  of 
dizziness and disturbance in attention) 
Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders  (placebo  27.8%,  25 mg  avapritinib  34.8%,  mostly  on 
account of pruritus) 
Eye Disorders (placebo 16.7%, 25 mg avapritinib 24.6%, mostly on account of periorbital oedema, 
eyelid edema, and lacrimation increased) 
Psychiatric Disorders (placebo 5.6%, 25 mg avapritinib 15.9%, mostly on account of anxiety and 
insomnia) 
Reproductive System and Breast Disorders (placebo 0%, 25 mg avapritinib 7.2%, not on account 
of any specific types of AEs) 
Conversely, in the following SOCs, higher incidences of AEs occurred with 25 mg avapritinib in patients with 
< 4 BSC at baseline, but not in patients with ≥ 4 BSC at baseline:  
Investigations  (placebo  20.0%,  25 mg  avapritinib  25.0%,  mostly  on  account  of  aspartate 
aminotransferase increased) 
Metabolism  and  Nutrition  Disorders  (placebo  5.7%,  25 mg  avapritinib  11.1%,  not  on  account  of 
any specific types of AEs) 
Renal and Urinary Disorders (placebo 0%, 25 mg avapritinib 5.6%, not on account of any specific 
types of AEs) 
Related Adverse Events (Investigator Assessment) 
Subgroup  analyses  of  study  drug-related  AEs,  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator  generally  indicated  an 
increase  in  the  probability  of  having  a  related  AE  with  avapritinib  25  mg,  compared  with  placebo,  in  all 
Assessment report

subgroup  categories,  with  the  highest  probability  being  for  the  age  group  ≥ 65 years  old  (Table  21); 
however the number of patients in this category is small and hence the analysis is not informative.

- represents odds ratios and p-values that were not estimable due to quasi-complete separation. An odds ratio of > 1 
indicates that treatment with avapritinib is favored. Relationship of AE to treatment was defined as AE that is considered 
to be related to the study drug by the Investigator according to the predefined criteria.  
Overall Avapritinib Population 
The subgroup analyses for the overall population (Part 1/2/3) of Study BLU-285-2203 did not reveal any 
new  concerns  pertaining  to  any  of  the  subgroup  categories  with  longer  exposure  to  25  mg  avapritinib 
beyond  Part  2  of  the  study.  Among  the  subgroups  of  baseline  ISM  status  and  number  of  baseline  BSC 
medications used (as summarized for Part 2 in Section 5.1.1.1), none of the SOCs and PTs with a higher 
incidence in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group than in the Placebo Group in Part 2 showed any relevant change 
in incidence in the overall population. 
Age 
As part of the responses to CHMP’s D120 LOQ, additional safety data in elderly patients was provided.  
Part 2: The number of patients in the 65-74 years of age subgroup is limited (8 and 9 patients in the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group and the Placebo Group respectively) and very few patients were in the 75-84 
years of age subgroup (1 and 2 patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and the Placebo Group 
respectively). There were no patients ≥85 years old (this column has been removed from the table 82).

a This group includes the patients who received placebo or 25 mg avapritinib in Part 1 or Part 2 and does not include the 
patients who received 50 mg or 100 mg avapritinib in Part 1. 
MAH provided safety data broken down by age groups (e.g. < 65 years, ≥ 65 years) as part of the 
responses to CHMP’s D120 LOQ.  
The majority of the patients were < 65 years of age, 203/226 and 222/246 in the All 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group and All Avapritinib Group respectively. 
The proportion of patients ≥ 65 years old experiencing any AE in the All 25 MG Avapritinib Group was 
very similar to that of patients < 65 years old (98.5% and 100% respectively).  
Assessment report

Page 161/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared with patients < 65 years old, in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, a higher incidence of events 
in the following SOCs was observed in patients ≥ 65 years of age. These were similar in the All 
Avapritinib Group. 
- 
Eye Disorders [29.6% (60/203 patients) and 43.5% (10/23 patients)], driven by periorbital 
edema which is a known event to occur with avapritinib and was frequently reported in patients < 
65 years of age as well; 
- 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders [51.7% (105/203 patients) and 60.9% (14/23 patients)], 
driven by pruritus, which was reported frequently in patients < 65 years of age as well. 
Compared with patients < 65 years old, a higher incidence of the following events was observed in 
patients ≥ 65 years of age in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group: oedema peripheral (12.3% and 30.4%), 
face oedema (4.4% and 17.4%), nausea (16.3% and 26.1%), arthralgia (11.8% and 21.7%) and cough 
(5.4% and 17.4%), however these were not considered clinically meaningful. No additional observations 
were noted in the All Avapritinib Group. 
Overall, the number of SAEs was limited in patients ≥ 65 years and no trends were observed. Similarly, 
no trends were observed regarding Grade ≥3 AEs and cognitive AEs in patients ≥ 65 years old compared 
to patients < 65 years old.  
Overall, the data does not suggest that elderlies are at higher risk for developing AEs, SAEs, Grade ≥ 3 
AEs or cognitive AEs when compared to younger population, however the number of patients in this 
category is significantly smaller.  
Exposure-Response Analysis 
The exposure-response analysis of the safety endpoints from Study BLU-285-2203, in which the time to 
event  for  AEs  of  interest  and  avapritinib  Cave  categorized  by  quartiles  was  evaluated,  revealed  no  clear 
relationships between avapritinib  exposure and the very low incidences of all Grade ≥ 3 AEs, Grade ≥ 1 
cognitive effect AEs, and Grade ≥ 1 weight gain. There was evidence for an association between avapritinib 
exposure and oedema AEs. In the 25 mg group, most of the oedema AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity 
(majority Grade 1) and none were Grade ≥ 3. None of the oedema AEs were reported as serious or led to 
discontinuation of avapritinib. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug Interactions 
Information in this section was submitted previously and is available in Module 2.7.4, Section 5.3, Original 
Application (GIST) and in Module 2.7.4, Section 5.3 for the AdvSM indication. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no data in pregnant women exposed to avapritinib, the secretion of avapritinib in human milk or 
its  effects  on  the  breastfed  infant,  or  on  milk  production  to  assess  the  risks.  Further  discussion  was 
submitted previously and is available in Module 2.7.4, Section 5.4, AdvSM indication. 
Overdose 
No cases of overdose have been reported. The highest dose of avapritinib studied clinically is 600 mg PO 
Overdose includes any dose higher than the intended dose as per the protocol. There is limited experience 
with cases of overdose reported in humans. There were 7 cases of overdose (due to additional 25 mg doses 
administered) reported in 5 patients treated with avapritinib 25 mg QD, none of them were associated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 162/179 
 
 
 
 
AEs (CSR BLU-285-2203, Listing 16.2.5.1). It should be noted that higher doses of avapritinib (200 mg and 
300 mg) are approved and the safety profile at these doses is well known. 
There is no known antidote for avapritinib overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, avapritinib dosing 
should be interrupted and supportive care instituted. Based on the large volume of distribution of avapritinib 
and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of avapritinib. 
Drug Abuse 
There have been no reports of patient abuse of or dependence on avapritinib. Because avapritinib is not 
pharmacologically  or  structurally  related  to  drugs  known  to  have  abuse  potential,  drug  abuse  with 
avapritinib is unlikely. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No  formal  studies  of  withdrawal  or  rebound  effects  associated  with  avapritinib  treatment  have  been 
conducted. There have been no AEs of “drug withdrawal syndrome” (MedDRA PT) reported to date. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No  formal  studies  on  the  effects  of  avapritinib  on  the  ability  to  drive  or  operate  machinery  have  been 
performed. 
Supportive Data 
Clinical Pharmacology Studies in Healthy Subjects 
In addition to earlier clinical studies, the clinical pharmacology of avapritinib was further characterized in 
the Phase 2 (BLU-285-2203) efficacy and safety study in patients with ISM (Module 2.7.2), and in the 
Phase 1 study (BLU-285-0107) investigating the effect of severe HI on the PK of avapritinib. Study BLU-
285-0107 demonstrated that severe HI was associated with a 20% increase in AUC0-∞ and a 20% 
decrease in Cmax for total plasma avapritinib, together with a 61% increase in AUC0-∞ and an 8% 
increase in Cmax for unbound plasma avapritinib. Further details are available in CSR BLU 285-0107. 
Compassionate Use Program 
One patient with ISM has been treated in the avapritinib compassionate use program. As of the data 
cutoff date (23 June 2022), this patient was still ongoing, and no SAEs had been reported.   
Expanded Access Program 
No patients with ISM were treated with avapritinib as part of the Expanded Access Program as of the data 
cutoff date of 23 June 2022. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
•  Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
Three  (3)  patients  (2.1%)  in  the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group  experienced  AEs  leading  to  study  drug 
discontinuation,  including  palpitation,  non-cardiac  chest  pain,  acute  myeloid  leukaemia,  disturbance  in 
attention (related), dizziness (related), dyskinesia (related), dyspnoea, and hypertension. In the Placebo 
Group,  1  patient  (1.4%)  experienced  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (diarrhoea,  general  physical  health 
deterioration, and headache, all related). In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 1 AE of Grade 4 acute myeloid 
leukaemia (unrelated) leading to study drug discontinuation in 1 patient was reported as serious. 
Overall Avapritinib Population (original submission) 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 163/179 
 
 
 
 
Of the 226 patients in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 7 patients (3.1%) experienced AEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation during 25 mg avapritinib treatment. Dyspnoea was reported in 2 patients (0.9%), all 
others  were  reported  in  1  patient  each  (acute  myeloid  leukaemia,  disturbance  in  attention  [related], 
dizziness  [related],  dyskinesia  [related],  hypertension,  mastocytotic  leukaemia,  migraine  [related],  non-
cardiac  chest  pain,  pain  in  extremity  [related],  palpitations,  peripheral  swelling,  and  weight  decreased 
[related]). Of these, 2 AEs that were assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator, Grade 4 
acute myeloid leukaemia and Grade 3 mastocytotic leukaemia in 1 patient each, were reported as serious 
in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group. No new concerns were observed from the patients in the All Avapritinib 
Group  regarding  the  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation.  In  this  group,  there  was  1  additional  patient,  who 
experienced a Grade 2 delirium (related) that led to discontinuation while on 50 mg avapritinib during Part 
1 of the study. 
•  Adverse Events Leading to Dose Modification 
Dose-modification  guidelines  for  toxicities  assessed  as  related  to  avapritinib  by  the  Investigator  were 
followed  as  per  BLU-285-2203,  Protocol,  and  included  a  change  in  dosing  regimen  from  QD  to  QOD  in 
patients who received 25 mg and reduction to a lower dose for patients who received 50 mg and 100 mg. 
Part 2 of study BLU 285 2203 
Low proportion of patients experienced AEs leading to dose reduction in both treatment groups. These 
included 2 patients (1.4%) in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (1 patient with diarrhoea [unrelated], nausea 
[unrelated], face oedema [unrelated] and 1 patient with memory impairment [related]), and 1 patient in 
the Placebo Group (memory impairment; related). Out of these, 1 patient each rolled over to Part 3 at QOD 
(avapritinib-treated patient) and QD (placebo treated patient) regimens. The remaining patient in the 25 
mg Avapritinib Group, later withdrew consent and did not roll over to Part 3. None of the events leading to 
dose reduction were serious. 
AEs leading to dose interruptions occurred in 12 patients (8.5%; related in 5 patients [3.5%]) in the 
25 mg Avapritinib Group  compared  to  9 patients  (12.7%;  related  in  4 patients  [5.6%])  in  the 
Placebo Group.  
In  the  25 mg Avapritinib Group,  dizziness  (all  related)  was  the  only  AE  leading  to  dose  interruption  in 
2 patients  (1.4%),  and  all  other  AEs  were  reported  in  1 patient  each.  In  the  Placebo Group,  3 patients 
(4.2%) reported headache [2 related], 2 patients (2.8%) reported vision blurred [1 related], and all other 
AEs leading to dose interruption were reported in 1 patient each. In the 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 2 patients 
had  SAEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  (Grade 3  COVID-19  pneumonia  in  1 patient  and  Grade 2  pelvic 
haematoma in 1 patient; both unrelated) and in the Placebo Group, 2 patients had SAEs leading to dose 
interruptions (COVID-19 pneumonia in 1 patient and COVID-19 in 1 patient; both Grade 3 unrelated). 
Overall Avapritinib Population (original submission) 
Of  the  226  patients  in  the  All  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group,  7  patients  (3.1%)  experienced  AEs  leading  to 
dose reduction (neutropenia [related], diarrhoea [unrelated], nausea [unrelated], face oedema [related], 
non-cardiac  chest  pain  [related],  liver  function  test  increased  [unrelated],  neutrophil  count  decreased 
[related], and pain in extremity [related]) reported in 1 patient each. None of these events were serious. 
No new concerns were observed in the All Avapritinib Group regarding AEs leading to dose reduction. There 
were 4 additional patients who experienced AEs leading to dose reduction, and all occurred while being on 
a higher dose of avapritinib in Part 1, including 1 SAE of Grade 3 gastrointestinal disorder that was assessed 
as related to study drug in a patient who received 50 mg avapritinib. 
Of the 226 patients in the All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, 26 patients (11.5%) experienced AEs leading to 
dose interruption during 25 mg avapritinib treatment; of whom 13 patients (5.8%) had AEs assessed as 
related to study drug by the Investigator. Dizziness was reported in 3 patients (1.3%; all related), headache 
(all related), nausea (1 related), COVID-19 (all unrelated), COVID 19 pneumonia (all unrelated), migraine

(all related), neutrophil count decreased (1 related), and non-cardiac chest pain (1 related) were reported 
in  2  patients  (0.9%)  each,  all  others  were  reported  in  1  patient  each.  Additional  to  the  events  reported 
above, 3 AEs (Grade 3 pancreatitis, Grade 3 nephrolithiasis, and Grade 3 COVID 19 pneumonia in 1 patient 
each; all unrelated) leading to dose interruption in 1 patient each were reported as serious in the All 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group. No new concerns were observed in the All Avapritinib Group regarding the AEs that led 
to dose interruption. There were 3 additional patients with SAEs leading to dose interruption (delirium in 
Part 1 in a patient with 50 mg avapritinib, fall in Part 1 in a patient with 100 mg avapritinib, and arthralgia 
in Part 3 in a patient who had rolled over from 100 mg avapritinib). 
Post marketing experience 
Avapritinib has not been yet approved in any country or region for the treatment of patients with ISM; 
therefore, no postmarketing data are available regarding the use of avapritinib in patients with ISM. 
Since the initial marketing authorization of avapritinib for GIST and the extension to include AdvSM, 
postmarketing reported events are consistent with the known safety profile of avapritinib in these 
indications; no new risks have been identified. Cumulatively, since the International Birth Date until 08 
July 2022 (Data Lock Point of the avapritinib PBRER 4), the overall estimated post-marketing exposure to 
avapritinib is 1223 patient-years, and this exposure is aligned with the higher doses of avapritinib given 
for GIST and AdvSM, 300 mg and 200 mg daily, respectively. 
Late breaking safety data 
After the data cutoff date (23 June 2022 for Study BLU-285-2203) through the late breaking data cutoff 
date  (within  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  avapritinib)  (23  August  2022),  one  SAE  of  hypersensitivity, 
assessed as unrelated by the Investigator, was received. No deaths or related SAEs, as assessed by the 
Investigator, have been reported since the data cutoff date through the late breaking data cutoff date.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH has provided safety data from a single, phase II, 3-part study in patients with ISM (study BLU-
285-2203).  Safety  data have  been  presented  separately  for  the  24-week,  placebo-controlled  part  of  the 
study (Part 2) and the overall study population. For the present assessment, the subset of ISM patients 
included in Part 2 (n=141) is the most relevant patient subset to characterise safety in the intended target 
population,  as  it  provides  short-term  comparative  safety,  while  the  rest  of  patient  subsets  are  mainly 
supportive.  
At the time of the most recent data cut-off (07/04/2023), parts 1 and 2 of study BLU-285-2203 had been 
completed, while part 3 was still ongoing (planned overall study follow-up: up to 5 years). Safety data from 
the avapritinib 25mg Safety Population, which include 226 patients treated with avapritinib 25mg across 
Part 1/2/3 of study BLU-285-2203, is the key subset for long-term data.  
Patient exposure 
In  Part  2  of  study  BLU-285-2203,  which  consisted  of  a  24-week,  double-blind  period,  the  median  (SD) 
treatment  duration  was  limited  (5.46  months  (0.726)  for  patients  in  25 mg Avapritinib Group  and 
5.43 months  (0.806)  for  patients  in  the  Placebo Group).  Longer  exposure  was  reported  for  the  Overall 
Avapritinib  Population,  where  the  median  (range)  treatment  duration  was  25.0  (12,  25)  months  in  the 
All 25 mg Avapritinib Group, with 76.5% patients received ≥ 6 months of avapritinib treatment and 31.4% 
patients received > 12 months of avapritinib treatment.  
In  general,  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in  part  2  of  the  study,  and  similar  in  number  in  both 
treatment groups (5 patients each). At the time of the data cut-off, 14 additional patients had discontinued 
treatment in part 3 of the study (main reason AE). Likewise, the number of ISM patients who had dose 
modifications was also low in part 2 and the overall safety population. Overall, avapritinib 25 mg QD appears 
to be reasonably tolerated, and toxicities seem manageable with dose modifications.  
Regarding the population included, although some small differences are observed between both treatment 
groups on part 2 (e.g., higher % of patients in the placebo group are 65 or older, have higher baseline 
serum tryptase median levels, higher KIT D816V mutation burden), overall it appears to be representative 
of the intended target population. 
Regarding  the  avapritinib  25mg  Safety  Population,  as  of  the  most  recent  data  cut-off  (07/04/2023), 
treatment  exposure  also  increased,  had  a  median  duration  of  18.00  months  (range:  0.7-46.1)  for  the 
avapritinib  25mg  treatment  group,  211  patients  were  still  ongoing  in  part  3  of  the  study  and  24  had 
discontinued. The most frequent reasons for study discontinuation were withdrawal of consent and AE (n=7, 
each). These 2 reasons account for 2/3 of all discontinuations, although the number of discontinuations is 
low, which is reassuring. 
Adverse events 
Common AEs 
In part 2, the most commonly reported AEs across both groups (≥ 10%) were headache, nausea, COVID-
19, dizziness, and diarrhoea. The frequency of G≥3 AEs (overall and related) was similar in both groups. 
Incidence of AEs and SAEs increased over time with the increased treatment duration, as seen in the overall 
avapritinib population (25mg and all-doses avapritinib populations).  
No deaths were reported in part 2 of the study.  
In the placebo-controlled part of the study, SAEs were more frequently reported in the placebo group than 
in the avapritinib group (11.3% vs. 5.0%, respectively). No SAEs related to treatment were reported on 
either group in this part of the study.

Related AEs were reported by 77 (54.6%) and 32 (45.1%) avapritinib and placebo patients respectively, in 
the  placebo-controlled  part  of  the  study.  Frequency  increased  slightly  with  the  increased  treatment 
duration, which is not unexpected, and could also be affected by the open-label nature of part 3.  
Regarding AE Severity in part 2, similar % of patients in the avapritinib and placebo groups experienced 
Grade ≥3 AEs . Proportion of patients with Grade ≥3 AEs increased slightly with treatment exposure. The 
most common Grade ≥3 AEs reported during any part of the study was anaphylactic reaction, which is also 
seen in ISM. Due to its potential severity and outcomes, the SmPC has been amended to adequately reflect 
this. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  any  AEs  leading  to  dose  modifications  or  permanent  treatment 
discontinuations were generally low across the different parts of the study. In the placebo-controlled part, 
3 (2.1%) in avapritinib 25mg group and 1 (1.4%) in placebo group permanently discontinued treatment 
due  to  AEs,  while  12  and  9  patients  required  dose  interruptions  and  2  and  1  patients  required  dose 
adjustments.  In  the  overall  avapritinib  population  the  discontinuations  and  dose  modifications  remained 
low. These findings suggest an acceptable tolerability, manageable by dose adjustments.  
Regarding  the  avapritinib  25mg  Safety  Population  (data  cut-off  date  07/04/2023),  overall,  no 
concerning/worrisome differences in the type of AEs, their incidence, seriousness or severity emerged with 
treatment over a longer period of time. An increase of ≥ 10% compared with the original data was noted 
for Grade ≥3 AEs, however the incidence of related Grade ≥3 AEs remained low. One new related SAE and 
one not related death were reported in the update period.  
One single death was reported in the study up to the most recent cut-off date. It occurred in part 3 of the 
study, in the context of a SAE of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and it was assessed as not related 
by the Investigator. 
Intracranial bleeding and cognitive effects are important identified risk for avapritinib in GIST and AdvSM 
and have been included as important potential risks for ISM. No intracranial bleeding AEs were reported in 
study BLU-285-2203 up to the most recent cut-off date. (see SmPC section 4.4). Regarding cognitive effects 
in the All 25 mg avapritinib Group, a total of 15 patients (6.6%) experienced cognitive effect AEs. These 
were  assessed  as  related  to  study  drug  in  7  patients  (3.1%).  The  most  commonly  reported  event  was 
memory impairment in 9 patients (4.0%) and cognitive disorders in 3 patients (1.3%) and all other events 
were  reported  in  1  patient  each.  In  Part  2  of  the  PIONEER  study,  cognitive  effects  occurred  in  2.8%  of 
patients with ISM who received 25 mg of avapritinib (see section 4.4); all cognitive effects were Grade 1 
or  2.  Overall,  none  of  the  patients  who  received  avapritinib  in  Part  2  of  PIONEER  required  permanent 
treatment discontinuation for cognitive effects. Overall, cognitive effects were reported at lower frequencies 
than those previously reported for GIST and AdvSM indications, the reasons for these differences are not 
entirely clear since the mechanism of occurrence is not well-known and CNS involvement isn’t unusual in 
SM. However, the non-severe (G<3) nature of most of the events is reassuring.  
Although oedema AEs were not predefined as AESIs, these AEs were reported in the previous GIST and 
AdvSM submissions and “fluid retention (pleural effusion)” was defined as identified risks.  
The  MAH  provided  data  on  these  AEs  separately  for  the  part  2  population  and  the  overall  avapritinib 
population. Oedema AEs were frequent in the placebo-controlled part of the study and the overall avapritinib 
population. Most of these AEs were considered related by the investigators and were mostly grade <3 in 
intensity. In addition, longer treatment exposure  did not appear to increase  their occurrence.  Localised 
(peripheral, facial) oedemas in patients with ISM, have been included in the PI with a frequency category 
of at least common (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
In patients with ISM, QT interval assessments by ECG should be considered, in particular in patients with 
concurrent factors that could prolong QT (e.g. age, pre-existing heart rhythm disorders, etc.)- see SmPC 
section 4.4.  
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023

The number of and elderly patients (≥65 years old) included in the study is rather small (9 patients in part 
2, and 23 patients treated with avapritinib 25mg in all 3 parts of the study), while no patients over the age 
of 85 were included. SAEs, in the 25mg avapritinib groups, AEs leading to drop-out, accident/injuries AEs 
and vascular disorders occurred slightly more frequently in patients age ≥ 65 than those <65 years of age. 
Overall,  no  meaningful  differences  in  safety  were  observed  between  patients  ≥65 years  and  those 
<65 years. 
The small size of the safety database in patients with ISM (226 patients treated with avapritinib 25mg QD; 
246  patients  treated  with  any  dose)  is  a  limitation  in  this  assessment,  however  prior  knowledge  on  the 
safety of avapritinib in the GIST and AdvSM indications sufficiently alleviate this concern. The recommended 
dose  of  avapritinib  is  25  mg  once  daily  (QD),  with  the  possibility  to  perform  dose  adjustment  based  on 
tolerability. This selected dose for patients with ISM, Avapritinib 25mg QD, is almost ten times lower than 
that  for  AdvSM,  and  more  than  ten  times  lower  than  the  GIST  dose  appears  to  have  an  acceptable 
tolerability,  manageable  by  dose  modifications.  Further,  annual  updates  from  study  BLU-285-2203  and 
submission of the final CSR will provide additional data in this context. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Avapritinib 25mg was well tolerated based on the low frequency of AEs leading to dose 
interruptions/reductions. The recommendations for dose adjustments appear to mitigate these toxicities 
over time. Overall, the safety profile appears consistent to that known in previous indications, no new 
safety concerns have been identified. Safety data have been reflected in the product information.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- The MAH will provide updated safety results of the study BLU-285-2203 annually until completion of the 
study. The final CSR should also be submitted when available following recommendation from the CHMP.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3of the 
SmPC have been updated.  The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1, which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
The Package Leaflet changes included in this Type II variation are not significant for its readability, as 
there are no new critical safety issues and no new key messages for the safe use of Ayvakyt. In addition, 
the MAH noted that the format, design, layout and writing style of the Package Leaflet remain the same 
as in the Package Leaflets that went through consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved indication is: 
AYVAKYT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) with 
moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment (see section 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 172/179 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no approved treatments for patients with ISM to reduce their disease burden, treat 
the underlying driver of ISM, or which impact the ISM disease course.  
Therapies currently recommended for ISM are considered palliative, administered with the intent of only 
improving symptoms.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on the results from the ongoing 3-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled phase-2 Study BLU-285-2203 (PIONEER) in patients with ISM with moderate or severe 
symptoms that failed to achieve control under symptomatic therapies.  
The study was conducted in 3 parts: 
• 
• 
• 
In Part 1, the optimal dose of avapritinib (RP2D) was identified in patients with ISM.  
In Part 2, patients with ISM were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to the avapritinib RP2D (25 mg 
QD) identified in Part 1 in combination with BSC, or to placebo in combination with BSC.  
In Part 3, patients who complete treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study can participate in a 
long-term extension, receiving avapritinib at the RP2D in combination with BSC. 
The main efficacy data come from Part 2 of the study in which 212 patients were enrolled (141 in the 
avapritinib arm and 71 in the placebo arm). Overall, 235 patients (34 patients from Part 1 and 201 
patients from Part 2) rolled over to Part 3 from Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. 
The primary endpoint in Part 2 of the study was defined as the mean change from baseline to cycle 7 day 
1 (C7D1; week 24) in the total symptom score (TSS) using the Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis-Symptom 
Assessment Form (ISM-SAF) compared to placebo.  
The results of Part 2 are based on a data cut-off date of 23 June 2022. Updated efficacy and safety data 
from Part 3 were provided during the procedure with a data cut-off date of 7 April 2023. At the time of 
this last DCO, Part 3 was ongoing.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint 
At C7D1, the LS mean (SE) change from baseline in the ISM-SAF TSS was –15.58 (1.536) points for the 
25 mg avapritinib group and –9.15 (2.013) for the placebo group. The difference (95% CI) between the 
groups was  –6.43 (–10.90, –1.96) points. This difference was statistically significant (1-sided  p-value  = 
0.003).  
Key secondary endpoints 
The results of the key secondary endpoints at C7D1 supported the primary efficacy analysis. 
•  24.8% (95% CI: 17.9, 32.8) of patients in the avapritinib group vs 9.9% (95% CI: 4.1, 19.3) of patients 
in  the  placebo  group  achieved  ≥  50%  reduction  in  the  ISM-SAF  TSS.  The  odds  ratio  (OR)  was  3.10 
(95% CI: 1.24, 8.64); 1-sided p-value = 0.005. 
•  45.4% (95% CI: 37.0, 54.0) of patients in the Avapritinib group vs 29.6%  (95% CI: 19.3, 41.6) of 
patients in the placebo group achieved ≥ 30% reduction in the ISM-SAF TSS. The OR was 2.07 (95% 
CI: 1.08, 3.99); 1-sided p-value = 0.009. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548651/2023 
Page 173/179 
 
 
 
 
•  53.9% (95% CI: 45.3, 62.3) of patients in the avapritinib group vs 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0, 5.1) of patients 
in the placebo group achieved ≥50% reduction in serum tryptase. The OR was not evaluable (95% CI: 
30.59, not evaluable); 1-sided p-value < 0.0001. 
•  67.8% (95% CI: 58.6, 76.1) of patients in the avapritinib group vs 6.3% (95% CI: 1.8, 15.5) of patients 
in the placebo group achieved either ≥50% reduction in KIT D816V MAF or became undetectable (< 
0.02%). The OR was 39.34 (95% CI: 10.93, 140.56); 1-sided p-value < 0.0001. 
•  52.8%  (95%  CI:  42.9,  62.6)  of  patients  in  the  avapritinib  group  vs  22.8%  (95%  CI:  12.7,  35.8)  of 
patients in the placebo group achieved either ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow mast cells or no mast 
cell aggregates. The OR 4.74 (95% CI: 2.06, 11.45); 1-sided p-value < 0.0001. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While a period of 24 weeks for the double-blinded placebo comparison can be accepted, the interpretation 
of long-term efficacy data, which are considered of particular relevance in this indolent scenario, is 
hampered by the absence of a control arm in Part 3 of the study. The MAH will provide updated efficacy 
results of the study BLU-285-2203 annually until completion of the study. The final CSR will be submitted 
when available. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Placebo-controlled part of study BLU 285 2203 (Part 2) 
Overall,  128 patients  (90.8%)  in  the  25 mg Avapritinib Group  and  66 patients  (93.0%)  in  the  Placebo 
Group  experienced  at  least  1 AE.  Of  them,  77 patients  (54.6%)  in  the  25 mg Avapritinib Group  and 
32 patients (45.1%) in the Placebo Group experienced related AEs.  Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 21.3% 
and 21.1% patients, respectively. Related Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 3 patients (2.1%) in the 25 mg 
Avapritinib Group and 2 patients (2.8%) in the Placebo Group. 
The  most  common  AEs  in  ISM  patients  (≥  10%  of  patients)  on  either  group  were  headache  (19.1% 
avapritinib  vs.  19.7%  placebo),  nausea  (12.8%  vs.  16.9%),  COVID-19  (12.1%  vs.  11.3%),  dizziness 
(11.3% vs. 8.5%), and diarrhea (10.6% vs. 11.3%).  
SAEs were reported in 5.0% and 11.3% patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group compared to the Placebo 
Group, respectively. No SAEs were assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator in either group.  
There were no deaths in Part 2 of the study. 
AEs led to interruption of study treatment in 8.5% and  12.7% of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib 
Group and Placebo Group, respectively; Related AEs leading to treatment interruptions occurred in 3.5% 
of patients in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group and 5.6% of patients in the Placebo Group.  
AEs  led  to  dose  reduction  in  2  patients  (1.4%)  in  the  25  mg  Avapritinib  Group  (related  in  1  patient 
[0.7%]) and 1 patient (1.4%) in the Placebo Group (related). AEs led to permanent study treatment 
discontinuation in 3 patients (2.1%) in the 25 mg Avapritinib Group (related in 2 patients [1.4%]) and 1 
patient (1.4%) in the Placebo Group (related).  
By  SOC,  in  the  avapritinib  25mg  group,  nervous  system  disorders  were  the  most  commonly  reported 
(38.3%), followed by GI disorders (36.9%), general disorders and administration site conditions (36.2%), 
infections and infestations (34.8%) and skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders (30.5%).  In the placebo group, 
GI disorders were the most commonly reported (38.0%), followed by nervous system disorders (33.8%), 
and infections and infestations (31.0%).

Cognitive effects and intracranial bleedings were considered AESI in the study. Cognitive effects were 
reported by 2.8% and 4.2%, in avapritinib 25mg and placebo groups, respectively, a majority of the cases 
were considered treatment related.  
No intracranial bleedings AESIs were reported. 
Overall avapritinib 25 mg population (data cut-off date 07 April 2023) 
Of  the  226  patients  in  the  All 25 mg Avapritinib Group,  223  (98.7%)  patients  experienced  AEs  and  151 
(66.8%) patients experienced AEs that were assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator. A total 
of 86 (38.1%) patients experienced Grade ≥ 3 AEs. Among these patients, AEs were assessed as related 
to study drug by the Investigator in 11 (4.9%) patients. The most common AEs in ISM patients treated 
with 25 mg QD (≥ 10% of patients) were COVID-19 (22.1%) headache (18.1%), nausea (13.7%), dizziness 
(13.7%), diarrhoea (11.5%), oedema peripheral (11.1%), fatigue and pruritus (10.6%, each).  
A total of 31 (13.7%) patients had SAEs and 1 patient (0.4%) experienced an SAE that was assessed as 
related to the study drug by the Investigator. One single deaths was reported during part 3 of the study, 
in the context of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (SAE, non-related). 
AEs led to interruption of study treatment in 38 (16.8) of patients (assessed as related in 18 (8.0%) 
patients). Overall, 13 (5.8%) patients experienced AEs leading to dose reduction (related in 11 (4.9%)) 
and  12  (5.3%)  of  patients  had  AEs  leading  to  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  (related  in  6 
(2.7%)).  
By SOC, infections and infestations were the most commonly reported disorders (n=170, 69.1%), followed 
by GI disorders (n=132; 53.7%). 
Of the 226 patients, 15 (6 .6%) experienced cognitive effects (most common: memory impairment, 9 
[4%]). No intracranial bleedings AESIs were reported up to the most recent cut-off date. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main limitations for the characterization of the safety profile of avapritinib in the ISM indication, in 
particular with regards to long-term safety and less common ADRs, are related to the small size of the 
safety database (246 ISM patients, 226 received 25mg QD) and limited long-term follow-up, with all 
evidence deriving from a single on-going study. The MAH will provide updated safety results of the study 
BLU-285-2203 annually until completion of the study. The final CSR will be submitted when available. 
Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding the potential effect on the course of the disease after avapritinib 
treatment discontinuation. 
The  uncertainties  regarding  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  avapritinib  is  also  considered  of  concern.  To 
address  this,  a  2-year  study  in  rats  will  be  submitted  by  the  MAH  following  the  recommendation  of  the 
CHMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy and safety of avapritinib in the indication for the treatment of ISM is based on a 3-part, 
placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study (BLU-285- 2203). In part 2 of the study a statistically significant 
reduction in the mean change from baseline to week 24 (C7D1) in the TSS using the ISM-SAF has been 
reported. The results for the (key) secondary efficacy endpoints also show statistically significant results 
in favour of the avapritinib arm.

The positive results observed in the primary endpoint are supported by a clear benefit of avapritinib over 
placebo in the secondary endpoints, including a decrease in systemic measures of mast cell burden, which 
is reasuring. Besides, while the effect of avapritinib was higher in skin symptoms, a decrease in all 
individual symptoms is observed to a greater or lesser extent. Thus, the effect of avapritinib in patients 
with ISM can be considered of clinical relevance.  
Efficacy data in the long-term showed that the efficacy appears to be maintained in the long term, but 
additional data would be required. The MAH will submit an annual report of study BLU-285-2203 and 
continuing annually until completion of the study as per the recommendation of the CHMP (REC).  
Regarding safety issues, the overall safety database for avapritinib in patients with ISM is small and the 
long-term exposure is limited, which raises concerns regarding the characterisation of long-term safety 
profile and less frequent adverse events. However, prior knowledge on the GIST and AdvSM indications 
could alleviate to some extent the concern, and longer-term data provided during the current variation 
further substantiate the safety of avapritinib in the intended indication.  
The overall incidence of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs is lower in ISM patients than 
those previously reported for the higher doses used in the GIST/AdvSM indications. Avapritinib 25mg was 
acceptably tolerated based on the low frequency of AEs leading to dose interruptions/reductions. The 
recommendations for dose adjustments appear to mitigate these toxicities over time.  
It is encouraging to note a low number of adverse events, as well as no intracranial haemorrhage events 
in view of the reported safety profile of avapritinib. However, it is recognized that a lower dose of 
avapritinib has been used in the current study and ISM patients with known risk factors for ICB were 
excluded. In addition, it needs to be taken into account that it is expected to treat patients over an 
extended period of time. Overall, the safety profile appears consistent to that known in previous 
indications, no new safety concerns have been identified. Annual updates and the final CSR data for study 
(BLU-285- 2203) will complement the current knowledge. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Avapritinib has shown benefit in terms of the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with 
moderate to severe ISM inadequately controlled with standard symptomatic therapy.  
The overall safety profile of avapritinib appears consistent with that seen in the GIST/AdvSM indications. 
Avapritinib 25mg QD was acceptably tolerated and toxicity was overall manageable in the proposed 
treatment setting.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ayvakyt is positive.

of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include for avapritinib treatment of adult patients with indolent systemic 
mastocytosis (ISM) with moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic 
treatment based on results from the pivotal part of study BLU-285-2203 (PIONEER), this is a 3-part, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study to evaluate safety and efficacy of avapritinib 
(BLU-285) in indolent and smoldering systemic mastocytosis with symptoms inadequately controlled with 
standard therapy. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 4.4 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ayvakyt is not similar to Rydapt within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication for Rubraca, was as monotherapy in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in adult 
patients with deleterious BRCA mutated tumours, inclusive of both germline BRCA and somatic BRCA mutations, 
and who have been treated with two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. 
The approved indication is as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or 
progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and 
who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors/prevention 
Ovarian cancer (OC) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the world. Epithelial OC 
is the most predominant pathologic subtype, with five major histotypes that differ in origination, pathogenesis, 
molecular alterations, risk factors, and prognosis. Genetic susceptibility is manifested by rare inherited 
mutations with high to moderate penetrance. Genome-wide association studies have additionally identified 29 
common susceptibility alleles for OC, including 14 subtype-specific alleles. Several reproductive and hormonal 
factors may lower risk, including parity, oral contraceptive use, and lactation, while others such as older age at 
menopause and hormone replacement therapy confer increased risks. These associations differ by histologic 
subtypes (histotype), especially for mucinous OC, likely reflecting differences in aetiology. The prevalence of 
ovarian cancer is currently estimated at 4.7 in 10,000. Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death attributed 
to gynaecological cancer in the developed world (World Cancer Report 2014, WHO, Chapter 5.12). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Nearly all benign and malignant ovarian tumours originate from one of three cell types: epithelial cells, stromal 
cells, and germ cells. In developed countries, more than 90% of malignant ovarian tumours are epithelial in 
origin, 5%–6% of tumours constitute sex cord-stromal tumours (e.g., granulosa cell tumours, thecomas, etc.), 
and 2%–3% are germ cell tumours (e.g., teratomas, dysgerminomas, etc.). Epithelial OC reflects a 
heterogeneous disease with histotypes that differ in their cellular origin, pathogenesis, molecular alterations, 
gene expression, and prognosis. Malignant OC, also known as carcinomas, are comprised of five main 
histotypes: high-grade serous (HGSOC; 70%), endometrioid (ENOC; 10%), clear cell (CCOC; 10%), mucinous 
(MOC; 3%), and low-grade serous (LGSOC; <5%). Rare high penetrant mutations in breast cancer gene 1 
(BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) greatly increase lifetime risk and account for the majority of 
hereditary cases and 10%–15% of all cases (Reid et al, Cancer Biol Med 2017. doi: 10.20892). Poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3, play critical roles in 
single-strand break (SSB) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. BRCA1 and BRCA2 play an important role in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 10/167 
  
  
 
repairing double-strand breaks (DSB) in DNA. The inhibition or inactivation of both SSB and DSB repair 
pathways by administration of a PARP inhibitor in the context of an underlying genetic defect such as a BRCA1/2 
mutation results in tumour cell death through accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage (Jayson et al, 2014, 
Lancet 384 (9951): 1376–88). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Early stage ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic and therefore difficult to detect. For women who do experience 
symptoms in the early stages, ovarian cancer is sometimes misdiagnosed because the majority of symptoms are 
nonspecific. These symptoms may overlap those of gastrointestinal and other diseases, and as a result, many 
patients may be treated incorrectly for months or years. Thus, ovarian cancer is often first detected in advanced 
stages when prognosis is poor. Because of delayed presentation and diagnosis, almost 75% of women with 
ovarian cancer are diagnosed with stage III/IV disease and 75% of women with advanced stage disease 
ultimately relapse or die from their disease, despite treatment. After initial therapy, most women will have a 
progression-free interval (PFI) of approximately 1.5 to 2 years, depending on the extent of post-operative 
residual disease and response to chemotherapy. However, relapse still occurs  in the majority of cases, and only 
10% to 30% of women experience long-term survival. Advanced stage disease is associated with a 5-year 
survival rate of only 30% to 40% (Doubeni et al, American Family Physician Volume 93, Number 11, 2016, pg 
937-944). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The standard approach to treatment of advanced HGSOC is cytoreductive surgery (either at time of diagnosis or 
interval debulking), with the goal of minimizing residual tumour to no visible residual disease, a major 
prognostic indicator for improved survival. Six to 8 cycles of platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy is the 
global standard of care. Despite a 70% to 80% initial response rate, most women have disease relapse. The 
choice of treatment for relapsed disease is based on the treatment-free interval relative to last platinum therapy 
administered. Platinum-based regimens dominate ovarian cancer therapy and define treatment groups. In 
general, patients whose disease progresses during treatment with a platinum-based regimen are considered to 
have platinum-refractory disease; patients whose disease relapses within 6 months after the last platinum agent 
was administered are considered to have platinum-resistant disease; and patients whose disease relapses more 
than 6 months after last platinum-based therapy was administered are considered to have platinum-sensitive 
disease. Those with an interval of equal to 6 months or higher and up to 12 months are considered to have 
partially platinum-sensitive disease, while those with an interval equal to 12 months or higher are considered to 
have fully platinum-sensitive disease. (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] guideline update, 
Ledermann et al, 2016) 
Patients with platinum-sensitive disease are typically retreated with platinum-based therapy until they no longer 
respond to or can no longer tolerate such treatment. Trabectedin with PLD or paclitaxel can be used for 
platinum-sensitive patients who cannot tolerate further platinum. Patients with platinum-resistant disease have 
more limited treatment options, such as bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin [PLD], or topotecan) or single-agent treatment with PLD, topotecan, gemcitabine, or 
weekly paclitaxel. There are no therapies specifically approved for use in the third-line setting and beyond (ie, 
after 2 or more prior therapies) for platinum-resistant disease. In addition, there is a lack of well-controlled 
studies of new or existing agents in later line settings.

Recently, PARP inhibitors, which have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation, have 
emerged as a new therapeutic option for treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer. In the EU, olaparib is approved 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients, with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian 
cancer, who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Another PARP inhibitor, niraparib, is indicated in 
a similar setting as maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive patients who are in response to 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
About the product 
Rucaparib is a potent, oral small molecule inhibitor of PARP enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3, 
which play critical roles in single-strand break (SSB) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 
play an important role in repairing DSB in DNA, and rucaparib has been shown to have anti-tumour activity in 
BRCA-mutant models. The inhibition or inactivation of both SSB and DSB repair pathways by administration of 
a PARP inhibitor, such as rucaparib, in the context of an underlying genetic defect such as a BRCA1/2 mutation 
results in tumour cell death through accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage (below figure). 
The indication for Rubraca initially proposed by the applicant was as follows: 
“Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in adult patients with 
deleterious BRCA mutated tumours, inclusive of both germline BRCA and somatic BRCA mutations, and who 
have been treated with two or more prior lines of chemotherapy.” 
The final indication as approved by the CHMP following review of the application is: 
“Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed or 
progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, and 
who are unable to tolerate further platinum-based chemotherapy.”

Treatment with rucaparib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
The recommended dose for Rubraca is 600 mg taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 1,200 mg, 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Rubraca was granted orphan drug designation on 10 October 2012, for which the number in the community 
register of orphan medicinal products is EU/3/12/1049. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan is not applicable as the indication has an agreed class waiver (CW/1/2011) 
confirmed on 17 August 2012 (EMA/502695/2012). 
The applicant made a request for an accelerated assessment based on the fact that an effective treatment in a 
setting of relapsed ovarian cancer could be considered an unmet medical need, there is no PARP inhibitor 
approved, and there is a lack of specific treatments for BRCA-mutated patients in the relapsed setting. 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest and more mature data were not expected to be available for the 
initial phase of the assessment. 
The applicant requested a conditional marketing authorisation based on the following reasons: 
• 
The applicant claimed that the benefit-risk balance is positive: 
Rucaparib has been well characterised in both nonclinical and clinical studies and has demonstrated meaningful 
efficacy in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer patients with an ORR that is reasonably likely to translate 
into clinical benefit. The unfavourable effects of rucaparib are acceptable within the context of the disease. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data: 
The applicant will submit data from Study CO-338-043 post-approval in order to provide confirmatory controlled 
data. Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) is a Phase 3 multicentre, open-label, randomized study of rucaparib versus 
chemotherapy in patients with BRCA-mutant or BRCA-like relapsed, high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. These data will further define the benefit-risk of rucaparib in the proposed 
indication. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed: 
There is a need of more active treatments capable of prolonging the life expectancy of these patients. In spite of 
high response-rates that could be achieved on platinum-based therapy, the majority of ovarian cancer patients 
will eventually recur. Effective and tolerable agents that can delay the recurrence of ovarian cancer and further 
chemotherapy treatment in these patients are highly awaited. The fact that it is a question of time that all 
patients will ultimately develop platinum-resistant disease justifies the unmet medical need. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: 
In a disease setting of BRCA-mutated relapsed ovarian cancer with poor long-term survival, significant 
co-morbidity, and decreasing clinical benefit despite repeated chemotherapy regimens, making rucaparib 
available on the market, offers an oral alternative therapy to patients for whom intravenous standard of care is

increasingly less well tolerated and less effective after multiple regimens. There has been slow progress in 
improving the outcome of ovarian cancer with chemotherapy over the last decade which has led to research into 
targeted therapies to offer women more effective and better tolerated options. PARP inhibitors represent a new 
step in the management of ovarian cancer and rucaparib can provide an important new molecularly targeted 
treatment option for patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer if it can be made immediately available. 
Clovis Oncology United Kingdom (UK) Limited sought Scientific Advice from the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) in 2012 on the overall non-clinical program and for studies CO-338-010 (Study 
10) and CO-338-014 (ARIEL3); follow-up Protocol Assistance (following the orphan designation) was sought in 
2013 on the demonstration of significant benefit in the maintenance (study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3)) and in 2015 
on the overall regulatory submission strategy for the proposed treatment indication.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of rucaparib camsylate is 
8-fluoro-2-{4-[(methylamino)methyl]phenyl}-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-6H-azepino[5,4,3-cd]indol-6-one 
((1S,4R)-7,7-dimethyl-2-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hept-1-yl)methanesulfonic acid salt corresponding to the molecular 
formula C19H18FN3O.C10H16O4S. It has a relative molecular mass of 555.67 g/mol and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 14/167 
  
  
Figure 1: structure of rucaparib camsylate 
The chemical structure of rucaparib camsylate was elucidated by a combination of 1H, 13C and 19F nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy. The solid 
state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic 
vapour sorption (DVS) and x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in 
aqueous media between pH 3 and 7, with significantly reduced solubility above pH 9.5. Two enantiotropic 
polymorphic forms are known, the chosen commercial form being the most thermodynamically stable form. 
Rucaparib itself has no chiral centres, although the camphorsulfonic acid counter ion does contain 2 
stereocentres which are controlled in the raw material by a test for specific optical rotation. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Rucaparib camsylate is synthesized by a single manufacturer from a single starting material with acceptable 
specifications. The final crystallization step controls both polymorphic form and particle size of the isolated 
active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, the starting material and reagents have been presented. Set-points and normal 
operating ranges (NORs) have been defined for raw material inputs and reaction parameters, along with proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) where justified by experimental data. Critical process parameters (CPPs), which 
impact the active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been defined, and the overall control strategy 
is considered suitable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. Relevant elemental impurities are controlled by the process to acceptable levels. 
Rucaparib is indicated for the treatment of advanced cancer and is itself clastogenic. Therefore, in line with ICH 
S9 and M7, limits for impurities, including those which are potentially mutagenic, are set in accordance with ICH 
Q3A(R2). Nonetheless, genotoxicity of the single specified impurity was assessed in silico which indicated no 
additional structural alerts relative to the active substance. Other potential genotoxic impurities theoretically 
present based on the synthetic process were found not to form in any detectable amount, except for a potential 
by-product used in the synthesis of the starting material. It was argued by the applicant that its presence is 
unlikely, given the ability of the processing to purge impurities. Nonetheless, the applicant committed to 
developing an analytical method capable of detecting and quantifying the relevant compound. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Only minor changes to the process have been made in order to improve the efficiency of 
the process and quality of the active substance. These have been presented in sufficient detail and justified. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  LDPE  bags,  stored  within  HDPE  drums.  The  material  of  the  primary 
packaging complies with EC directives 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR), assay (HPLC), assay of 
camphorsulfonic acid (ion chromatography), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content 
(KF), particle size (Ph. Eur.), and inorganic impurities (residue on ignition, Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. The limit for one manufacturing impurity will 
be  re-assessed  by  the  applicant  once  sufficient  production  scale  manufacturing  experience  is  gathered  and 
tightened if warranted. The active substance specifications are based on the active substance CQAs and are 
deemed acceptable. Omission of tests for other parameters was justified based on the information submitted. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 15 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance made using the proposed 
commercial process (some with minor modifications to the filtration equipment) were provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended 
commercial primary package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Two 
batches were manufactured on production scale using an earlier iteration of the manufacturing process, 
although differences are considered unlikely to impact active substance quality. The third batch was 
manufactured on pilot scale using the proposed commercial route. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, 
related substances, water content, polymorphic form (XRPD) and microbiological evaluation (Ph. Eur.). The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release for those tests common to both specifications, and for the 
others, properties were suitably validated. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were 
observed under either storage condition. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. A slight yellowing and 
increase in degradation products was observed. Although the active substance is slightly photosensitive, the 
opaque container closure system provides sufficient protection from light. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out on one batch, exposed to heat, heat and humidity, aqueous acid, 
aqueous base and aqueous oxidant. A small amount of degradation was observed in acid, base and at high 
temperature, whereas significant degradation occurred under oxidative conditions. The results indicate that the 
HPLC method is stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Rubraca film-coated tablets contain rucaparib camsylate, equivalent to either 200, 250 or 300 mg of rucaparib 
freebase. The different strengths are made from a common blend which are then pressed and coated to form 
tablets distinguishable by colour, shape and debossing. 
The aim was to develop an immediate-release oral dosage form with adequate quality for the intended 
indication. 
A risk assessment was carried out in order to evaluate the potential of active substance properties, (solubility, 
polymorphic form, stability, hygroscopicity, flow properties and particle size), to impact the finished product 
manufacturability and CQAs. Based on knowledge of the active substance properties, the risk was considered 
low. 
The active substance is a stable, non-hygroscopic crystalline solid which is slightly soluble in 
biologically-relevant aqueous media. Solubility decreases below pH 3 as less soluble salts can form with the 
counter ions of stronger acids (e.g. HCl and H2SO4), but is enhanced in biorelevant media such as fed state 
simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF). 
Compatibility with most of the selected excipients was demonstrated using studies on binary mixtures of active 
substance with each chosen excipient under stressed conditions (50 oC / 75% RH). Given the stability of the 
active substance and prior clinical formulations, drug-excipient compatibility with the rest of the excipients, 
colloidal silicone dioxide and film-coating, is considered demonstrated. All excipients, including the individual 
ingredients in the film-coating mixture, are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in section 2.1.1 of this report. 
Several different formulations were used in early clinical trials. The commercial formulation was introduced 
during phase 2 clinical trials. All three strengths are made from a common blend and, apart from the film-coat, 
are qualitatively identical and quantitatively proportional. 
The amounts of active substance and different excipients were optimised to allow formulation of a robust tablet. 
The manufacturing process was chosen to address the properties of the active substance. The likely impact of 
individual process steps on the finished product CQAs was assessed and CPPs identified experimentally. 
Set-points and PARs were defined for CPPs in several manufacturing steps. 
Development of the dissolution method took into account the properties of the active substance including its low 
aqueous solubility. The discriminatory power of the chosen method, as well as some of the other dissolution 
media, was evaluated against batches of finished product manufactured with meaningful changes in 
composition and manufacturing process parameters. The test is deemed acceptable as a quality control method 
and suitable specifications have been set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 17/167 
  
  
The primary packaging is an HDPE bottle, with a PP induction seal closure. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: blending of active substance with intra-granular 
excipients and sieving; roller compaction; blending with extra-granular excipients; compression; film-coating; 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
It has been demonstrated during production of clinical and development batches that the manufacturing process 
is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. A process validation 
scheme has been provided which is deemed acceptable. Process validation will be carried out on a minimum of 
three commercial scale batches of each tablet strength prior to commercialization. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance, identity (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and microbial limit (Ph. Eur.). In line with ICH Q3D, a risk 
assessment was carried out to determine the likelihood of metal contaminants being present in the finished 
product. Furthermore, analysis data from multiple batches of finished product showed that no class 1 or 2a 
elemental impurities, not palladium, were present above 30% of the permitted daily exposure (PDE) levels. The 
absence of tests for elemental impurities is considered justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of the 200 and 300 mg tablets manufactured at 
the previous manufacturing site, (not registered for commercial production), as well as two batches each of the 
200 and 300 mg tablets, and one 250 mg batch, manufactured at slightly lower than planned production scale 
at the commercial site. The results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches each of the 200 and 300 mg strengths of finished product was 
provided. All three strengths are made from a common blend, and, apart from the film-coat, are qualitatively 
identical and quantitatively proportional. The different strengths are packed in HDPE bottles of different sizes. 
However, the ratio of tablet mass to container volume is comparable from strength to strength. Therefore, this 
bracketing approach is acceptable. The batches were produced by a different manufacturer using a process 
which simulates the proposed commercial process and had the same composition as the proposed commercial 
tablets. They were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing (other than the white colourant 
used in the bottles) and were stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. In addition, one

batch of each strength manufactured at the proposed commercial site at slightly less than production scale and 
stored in the proposed commercial primary packaging was stored for up to 12 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH). The batches 
of medicinal product are considered representative of the commercial product. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and microbial 
limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant variability in any of the measured 
parameters was observed, save for a small increase in water content, which was within the proposed 
specification limits and is not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used 
according to the directions in the SmPC. 
In addition, one batch each of the 200 and 300 mg tablets produced by the previous manufacturer, and one 
batch of each strength produced by the commercial manufacturer were exposed to light as defined in the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Results indicate that the product is 
not photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months, with no special storage conditions, as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
The limits for impurities should be re-assessed by the applicant once sufficient production scale 
manufacturing experience is gathered and tightened if warranted. 
The applicant should develop an analytical method capable of confirming the absence of a potential 
manufacturing impurity to levels below the ICH qualification threshold defined in ICH Q3A (R2).

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Rucaparib has been characterised in a series of non-clinical studies conducted to support the use of rucaparib as 
an oral monotherapy for patients with BRCA1/2 mutation positive advanced cancers.  
The primary and secondary pharmacology studies were not conducted in accordance with GLP. However, the 
main/pivotal toxicity studies with safety pharmacology endpoints and stand-alone safety pharmacology studies 
were conducted in accordance with GLP regulations. 
The toxicity studies were performed in rats and dogs with duration of up to 6 months for IV administration and 
up to 92 days for oral administration. The non-clinical toxicology program was designed initially to support 
intravenous dosing but was supplemented with additional studies to support oral dosing. 
Scientific Advice was sought on aspects of the nonclinical development program, and specifically, on the 
toxicology program. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology of rucaparib was studied in vitro and in vivo in order to demonstrate its activity as a potent 
inhibitor of PARP enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Pharmacodynamics - in vitro studies 
The inhibition of rucaparib on the activity of recombinant human PARP-1 and mouse PARP-2 was determined in 
an enzymatic assay measuring the incorporation [32P]-NAD+ into ADP-ribose polymers. Rucaparib was a potent 
inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2 with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 1.4 ± 0.2 and 0.17 ± 0.05 nM, respectively. 
Crystallographic analysis showed that rucaparib bound to the active (NAD+ binding) catalytic site of PARP-1.  
Biochemical profiling of twelve PARP family members using an enzymatic assay measuring the incorporation of 
biotinylated NAD+ to activated DNA showed that rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3 
enzymes with IC50 values of 0.8, 0.5, and 28 nM, respectively (Table 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 20/167 
  
  
 
 
Table 1 Inhibitory Effects of Rucaparib on PARP Enzymes 
The  potency  and  mechanism  of  action  of  rucaparib  were  assessed  in  the  UWB1.289  (BRCA1  mutant)  and 
UWB1.289+BRCA1 (BRCA wild-type) isogenic cell line pair. Cell viability data showed that the UWB1.289 cell 
line was more sensitive (IC50 of 375 nM) to rucaparib treatment than the BRCA1 restored UWB1.289+BRCA1cell 
line (IC50 of 5430 nM). The 14-fold lower IC50 in the UWB1.289 cell line is consistent with the concept of synthetic 
lethality.  
The impact of rucaparib on PARP inhibition was determined in vitro in the BRCA1 mutant UWB1.289 cell line by 
measuring the incorporation of biotinylated PAR onto histone proteins using an ELISA assay. Rucaparib inhibited 
formation of PAR in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 2.8 nM after 24 hours of treatment. The 
accumulation of SSBs was also evaluated in the UWB1.289 cell line using an alkaline Comet assay which detects 
single and double-stranded breaks based on the DNA “comet” tail shape and migration pattern by 
epifluorescence microscopy. Rucaparib increased DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 
1.5 µM after 24 hours of incubation.

Induction of DNA Damage 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018

Additional mechanism of action studies using UBW1.289 cell line showed a concomitant and dose-dependent 
increase in DNA damage and an inverse relationship between rucaparib doses as compared to cell viability and 
caspase 3/7 levels. Taken together, these data suggest rucaparib treatment of the BRCA1 mutant UBW1.289 
cell line results in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. 
Rucaparib sensitivity was assessed in a panel of 12 breast and 14 ovarian cancer lines (figure below). Rucaparib 
treatment decreased the viability of several BRCA1/2 mutant cell lines, for example the IC50 of rucaparib in the 
BRCA mutant MDA-MB-436, HCC1395 and UWB1.289 cell lines was 91, 254, and 375 nM, respectively. In 
addition, cell lines with a defective HRR phenotype, as defined by the fold induction of γH2AX/RAD51 foci 
formation, had a statistically significant lower median rucaparib IC50 compared to HRR-proficient cells. 
Figure 3: Rucaparib Sensitivity in a Panel of Breast and Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines 
As an assessment of the in vitro activity of rucaparib in HRR deficient cells, a series of siRNA knock down (KD) 
experiments were performed. Gene KD by siRNA was used to model the impact of functional inactivation (i.e., 
deleterious mutation on one allele and loss of the wild type allele) of BRCA1/2. Knock down of BRCA1/2 
increased rucaparib cytotoxicity in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer cell lines. The IC50 of rucaparib in the 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Panc 10.05 cell line with reduced levels of BRCA1 or BRCA2 was 4564 
and 356 nM, respectively. This represented a 2.8-fold and 35.3-fold increase in rucaparib sensitivity when 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression was reduced, respectively, compared to Panc 10.05 cells transfected with a 
non-targeting (NT4) control siRNA. 
Genomic alterations in non-BRCA HRR genes may also render cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors. To test whether 
defects in non-BRCA HRR genes can induce sensitivity to rucaparib in vitro, 31 genes were individually knocked 
down by transient siRNA transfection in four different ovarian cancer cell lines (SK-OV-3, OVCAR-3, 
UWB1.289+BRCA1 and OAW-28 cell lines). BRCA1/2 KD increased the in vitro potency of rucaparib. The KD of 
7 individual genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, FANCM, PALB2, ATR, and BARD1) also increased rucaparib 
sensitivity compared to the NT4 transfected control. These results confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction

between rucaparib and BRCA1/2 mutations, and were consistent with the hypothesis that reduced levels of 
non-BRCA HRR related genes may confer sensitivity to rucaparib in ovarian cancer cell lines. 
In addition to catalytic inhibition of the enzymatic activity, PARP inhibitors may also function by “trapping” 
PARP-1 and PARP-2 enzymes at damaged DNA. Avian B lymphoblast DT40 and human prostate DU145 cell lines 
were treated with 3 compounds including rucaparib, and PARP-DNA complexes were assessed by Western blot 
analyses of chromatin-bound fractions. A dose-dependent accumulation of PARP-DNA complexes was observed 
in rucaparib-treated cells suggesting that the mechanism of action of rucaparib may include DNA trapping. 
Pharmacodynamics - in vivo studies 
A series of PK, PK/PD, and efficacy studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy and MOA of rucaparib in 
subcutaneous and orthotopic MDA-MD-436 (BRCA1 mutant) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenograft 
mouse models. The MDA-MB-436 cell line has a BRCA1_p.K1780_splice mutation and loss of the other BRCA1 
allele. 
Rucaparib Efficacy in the MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 Mutant) Subcutaneous Breast Cancer Xenograft Model 
In vivo, the anti-tumour activity of rucaparib was initially evaluated in the subcutaneous BRCA1 mutant 
MDA-MB-436 TNBC model. Oral rucaparib dosing at 150 mg/kg on QD or BID schedules, or 250 mg/kg QD, 
resulted in > 100% TGI after 17 days of dosing. Following cessation of rucaparib administration at Day 21, the 
tumour response in the rucaparib-treated groups was maintained until Day 45 with partial responses (PR) or 
complete responses (CR) being observed in all of the mice in the rucaparib-treated groups. 
Plasma PK Parameters of Rucaparib Following a Single Oral Dose to Female NOD/SCID Mice 
This was a single oral dose PK study performed in non-tumour bearing NOD/SCID mice to determine the plasma 
PK parameters of rucaparib following single oral gavage administration of rucaparib camsylate at 2, 5, 15, 50, 
and 150 mg/kg. It revealed that rucaparib was detected in the plasma of all animals up to 12 hours and Tmax was 
at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Rucaparib T1/2 ranged from 1 to 3 hours. Exposures (Cmax and AUC0-12) were 
approximately dose proportional from 2 to 15 mg/kg, but were greater than dose proportional at 50 and 150 
mg/kg as compared to 2 mg/kg. 
PK/PD Assessment of Rucaparib in the MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 Mutant) Orthotopic Breast Cancer Xenograft Model 
In a PK/PD study in the BRCA1 mutant MDA-MD-436 TNBC orthotopic xenograft model, mice were given 5 doses 
of rucaparib at 2, 5, 15, 50, or 150 mg/kg. A dose-dependent inhibition of PAR was observed from 2- 150 mg/kg 
BID. Administration of 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg BID rucaparib resulted in statistically significant inhibition of 45%, 
86%, and 96% respectively. There was an inverse and dose-dependent correlation between PAR and rucaparib 
levels in the plasma and tumour. Although the tumour to plasma (T/P) ratio was lower at higher doses of 
rucaparib, the levels of rucaparib in the tumour were consistently higher than the levels of rucaparib in plasma. 
A further PK/PD study was performed in the subcutaneous MDA-MB-436 xenograft model. Animals were treated 
with a single dose of 150 or 250 mg/kg rucaparib, or with 2 doses of 150 mg/kg rucaparib administered 8 hours 
apart. There was a higher T/P ratio at all time points evaluated.

Rucaparib Efficacy in the MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 Mutant) Orthotopic Breast Cancer Xenograft Model 
The anti-tumour activity of rucaparib at doses of 2, 5, 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg BID was evaluated in the 
orthotopic BRCA1 mutant MDA-MB-436 TNBC xenograft model. Rucaparib administration resulted in 
dose-dependent and statistically significant reduction in mean tumour volumes on the last day of dosing (Day 
28) in all rucaparib treated groups, with > 100% TGI observed at 50 and 150 mg/kg BID. At study termination 
(Day 39) there was a dose-dependent and statistically significant TGI in all rucaparib treated groups. 
Dose, Exposure and Response Relationship of Rucaparib in the MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 Mutant) Orthotopic Breast 
Cancer Model 
The dose, exposure and response relationship of rucaparib was evaluated in the studies performed in the 
orthotopic MDA-MB-436 TNBC xenograft model. In mice treated with rucaparib at a dose of 50 and 150 mg/kg 
BID, PAR was inhibited by 86% and 96%, respectively. Administration of rucaparib at 50 and 150 mg/kg BID 
resulted in TGI of 105% and 112%, respectively. Thus in this rucaparib sensitive model, ≥ 86% PAR inhibition 
in the tumour resulted in > 100% TGI. In contrast, dosing at 15 mg/kg BID resulted in only 45% PAR inhibition 
and lower anti-tumour activity, with a TGI of 58%. Direct correlations were observed between rucaparib plasma 
exposure (Cmax and AUC0-12), tumour rucaparib levels, and TGI. Comparing the exposures in mice treated with 
50 mg/kg rucaparib BID and patients treated with 600 mg rucaparib BID, the estimated human-to-mouse ratio 
of unbound rucaparib AUC0-12 was 1.9. Thus, the exposures of unbound rucaparib in patient plasma are higher 
than that required for significant and durable anti-tumour responses in nonclinical models. 
Rucaparib Efficacy in the HBCx-17 (BRCA2 Mutant) TNBC PDX Model and in the HBCx-6 (BRCA Wild-type) TNBC 
PDX Models 
The anti-tumour effects of rucaparib as a single agent were evaluated in the BRCA2 mutant HBCx-17 and BRCA 
wild-type HBCx-6 TNBC PDX models. Both models have mutated TP53. Rucaparib was administered at doses of 
50 mg/kg QD, 150 mg/kg QD and 150 mg/kg BID for 24 and 28 days in the HBCx-17 and HBCx-6 models, 
respectively. Rucaparib treatment at all doses evaluated resulted in significant reduction in tumour growth, with 
mean tumour/control (T/C) volumes ranging from 7.0-15.2% and 0.6-14.7% in the HBCx-17 and HBCx-6 
models, respectively. In both studies, tumours were monitored for 13-15 days after rucaparib dosing was 
discontinued. In the HBCx-17 model, 50% of the mice treated with 150 mg/kg BID rucaparib had a PR or CR, 
whereas in the HBCx-6 model 100% of the mice treated with 150 mg/kg QD or 300 mg/kg BID rucaparib had a 
PR or CR. 
Rucaparib Efficacy in 3 BRCA2 Mutant Pancreatic PDX Models 
The efficacy of 150 mg/kg BID rucaparib was evaluated in the PAXF 1876, PAXF 2005 and PAXF 2094 pancreatic 
PDX models that have deleterious BRCA2 frame shift mutations On Day 28 of dosing, rucaparib showed 
differential sensitivity in the 3 models, with a T/C of 4.5%, 26.1%, and 55.6% for the PAXF 2005, PAXF 2094, 
and PAXF 1876 models, respectively. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology assays included the off-target activity of rucaparib in radioligand binding assays, the 
potency of rucaparib against 530 wild type and mutant kinases by functional enzymatic profiling, and the 
follow-up profiling against 15 recombinant kinases and cellular reporter assays against three PIM family kinases. 
The potential for off-target pharmacological activity of rucaparib was evaluated against 39 primary molecular 
targets, in a receptor screening assay that included transmembrane and soluble receptors, ion channels, and 
Assessment report

monoamine transporters. At a concentration of 10 µM, rucaparib exhibited ≥50% inhibition against 2 targets, 
the non-selective sigma and sodium channel site 2. The IC50 values for these 2 receptors were 1.1 µM (Ki = 1.07 
µM), and 2.67 µM (Ki = 2.39 µM), respectively. Functional tissue assays concluded that rucaparib showed 
neither agonist nor antagonist activity against the sodium channel 2, but showed weak functional antagonist 
activity (37%) against the non-selective sigma channel. The 30 µM concentration of rucaparib evaluated in the 
functional tissue assays was approximately 17-fold higher than the plasma rucaparib unbound Cmax of 1.79 µM 
observed in patients at 600 mg BID. Rucaparib was also evaluated at a concentration of 10 µM against 5 
endocrine related targets in a focused screening assay. No significant inhibition (≥ 50%) of the oestrogen 
receptor α (2 separate assays), oestrogen receptor β, progesterone receptor B, testosterone (2 separate 
assays) or thyroid receptor was noted. This concentration (10 µM) of rucaparib was approximately 6-fold higher 
than the plasma rucaparib unbound Cmax of 1.79 µM observed in patients at 600 mg BID. 
The selectivity of rucaparib against 384 wild-type and 146 mutant recombinant human kinases was evaluated at 
1 μM using functional biochemical assays. A total of 3 enzymes demonstrated ≥70% inhibition by rucaparib: 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 16 (86%), the PIM3 protooncogene (PIM3, 83%), and CDK17 (70%). Additional 
biochemical profiling demonstrated that the IC50 of rucaparib against 11 kinase targets (including PIM1 and 
PIM3) was lower than the unbound mean plasma Cmax (1.79 µM) observed in patients treated with 600 mg BID 
rucaparib. However, the IC50 of rucaparib for PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3 in cellular reporter assays was > 40 µM. 
These data suggested that rucaparib is not likely to have activity against PIM1 and PIM3 at exposures achieved 
in patients. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
As part of the development program for rucaparib, several stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted. Additionally, cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) safety pharmacology 
endpoints were incorporated into study designs for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and dog. This 
approach is consistent with ICH S9, which specifies that stand-alone safety pharmacology studies are not 
generally required to support studies in patients with advanced cancer. The cardiac safety of rucaparib was 
evaluated in an in vitro assay for hERG activity, in a safety pharmacology study using conscious 
telemetry-instrumented dogs given rucaparib IV, and by monitoring ECGs in these dog studies: PO repeat-dose 
toxicity studies of 30 and 91 days and the 5-day IV repeat-dose toxicity study.  
The IC50 for the inhibitory effects of rucaparib on hERG potassium currents was 22.6 μM which is approximately 
13-fold higher than the mean unbound plasma Cmax (1.79 μM) observed in patients treated with 600 mg BID 
rucaparib. 
No adverse cardiovascular effects were noted in conscious telemetry-instrumented dogs that received rucaparib 
IV at up to 15 mg/kg. This dose corresponded to a Cmax of 2542 ng/mL, which is 1.3-fold higher than the total 
plasma Cmax (1940 ng/mL) observed in patients treated with 600 mg BID rucaparib. In the repeat-dose studies 
in dogs given rucaparib orally, no ECG changes were observed at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (30-day 
repeat-dose study) and 20 mg/kg/day (91-day study) as well as no alterations in haemodynamic parameters or 
vital signs noted in the 91-day repeat-dose study. At 75 mg/kg, the Cmax of 1680 and 2460 ng/mL for male and 
female dogs, respectively, was similar to the Cmax bound plasma concentration (1940 ng/mL) observed in 
patients treated with 600 mg BID rucaparib. 
Conversely, when rucaparib was given IV at 40 mg/kg for 5 days, ECG abnormalities described as persistent 
sinus tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal rhythm, were recorded in the dog. From the ECG tracings, the 
veterinary cardiologist concluded that nodal and ventricular arrhythmias identified in one dog indicated a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 25/167 
  
  
potential for rucaparib to induce arrhythmias and suggested that arrhythmia may have been related to the death 
of two dogs that died immediately post-dosing on Day 1.  
Cardiac lesions were observed in rats and dogs following IV but not after PO dosing of rucaparib. In ten PO 
general toxicity studies (rat and dog combined) cardiac changes were not identified. Conversely, 4 GLP IV 
toxicity studies (rat and dog combined) were conducted and cardiac microscopic changes (myocardial 
degeneration (rat) and endocardial haemorrhage (dog)) were detected in two of these studies. Exposure data 
indicated that cardiac lesion development following IV dosing was likely Cmax driven as cardiac effects were 
correlated to high Cmax values after IV dosing. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in dog given rucaparib orally, there were no abnormalities in ECGs at doses 
up to 75 mg/kg/day (30-day repeat study), which corresponded to a mean Cmax of 2070 ng/mL (Cmax of 1680 
and 2460 ng/mL for male and female dogs, respectively). Measurements of external ECGs, as well as vital signs 
(heart rate, body temperature, pulse oximetry, and respiratory rate), were also evaluated in the 91-day 
repeat-dose study in dog, with no findings at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (Cmax of 416 and 377 ng/mL for males 
and females, respectively). ECG abnormalities described as persistent sinus tachycardia and atrioventricular 
nodal rhythm were recorded when rucaparib was administered IV at a dose of 40 mg/kg for 5 days in dog. 
Therefore, it is concluded that rucaparib induce abnormal arrhythmias at IV doses of 40 mg/kg/day and 75 
mg/kg/day in dog and rat, respectively.  
Cardiac effects were observed in rats and dogs treated with rucaparib, but after IV administration at high doses, 
≥ 75 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 40 mg/kg/day in dogs. In addition, microscopically, cardiac changes were 
described as myocardial degeneration in rat and a higher incidence of endocardial haemorrhage in dog when 
administered IV. No effects were observed with oral dosing of rucaparib to dog (75 mg/kg) and to rat (500 mg) 
in repeat-dose toxicity studies. However, the Cmax exposure in these animals showed safety margins of 1.0 and 
0.9 respectively. Therefore, a potential risk for humans cannot be discounted. 
There were no rucaparib-related effects on functional observation battery and motor activity parameters 
measured as part of the 91-day repeat-dose study in rat at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.  
Exposures of rucaparib in the brain were not measured in the 91-day study in rat. However, in the [14C]rucaparib 
rat study radioactivity was non-detectable or very low in the brain and spinal cord in rats following a single oral 
dose of 150 mg/kg (400 μCi/kg) rucaparib. No rucaparib-related clinical signs which were considered to be 
CNS-related were noted in the 91- day repeat-dose study in dog. Based on in vitro human transporter studies 
rucaparib is a substrate of human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), both 
present in human blood-brain-barrier. The potential for rucaparib to elicit effects on respiratory function was 
evaluated by incorporating vital signs in the 91-day repeat-dose study in beagle dogs. Rucaparib administration 
at any dose level had no effect on respiration rate. The dose of 20 mg/kg was the NOEL for respiratory function 
in this study, which corresponded to a Cmax of 416 and 377ng/mL in male and female dogs, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions study was submitted which was considered acceptable (see discussion 
on nonclinical aspects).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays were developed for PK and TK studies 
and were further validated in both rat and dog plasma and used to determine the concentrations of rucaparib in 
GLP toxicity studies. 
A total of 9 studies were performed to evaluate the PK or TK of rucaparib following single IV and PO 
administration in the mouse, rat, and dog. In addition, the repeat PO dose TK of once daily rucaparib was 
examined in a 7-day non-GLP toxicology study in SD rats, two 7-day non-GLP toxicology studies in beagle dogs, 
28-day and 91-day GLP toxicology studies in SD rats, and 30-day and 91-day GLP toxicology studies in beagle 
dogs. The TK of PO rucaparib was also assessed in a non-GLP dose range finding (DRF) embryo-foetal 
development study in pregnant SD rats. 
Absorption 
The absolute oral bioavailability of rucaparib was 17%, 22%, and 74-75% in mice, rats, and dogs respectively. 
Rucaparib showed moderate plasma protein binding and a high distribution volume with Vss of 6.14, 6.5, and 
15.2 L/kg in mouse, rat and dog, respectively. This is consistent with the preferential rucaparib distribution in 
RBCs with RBC-to-plasma ratios of 2 to 5.21 in animal species and wide tissue distribution in rats. The terminal 
elimination half-life (T1/2) following IV dosing was 1.3, 3.5, and 4.5 hours in mice, rats, and dogs, respectively. 
Following repeat oral administration, Tmax was variable in both rat and dog, ranging from 2 to 8 and 1 to 7 hours, 
respectively. In rats, systemic exposure, as measured by peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC0-24), increased approximately dose 
proportionally between 10 and 40 mg/kg/day and less than dose proportionally in the tested dose range of 40 
to 1000 mg/kg/day. In dogs, systemic exposure, as measured by Cmax and AUC0-24, were slightly less than dose 
proportional in the tested dose range of 10 to 80 mg/kg/day. There were generally no sex-related differences in 
the exposure to rucaparib. Following repeated dosing, there was no apparent accumulation of rucaparib and T1/2 
was not changed. 
Following once daily 30-min IV infusion of rucaparib phosphate in rats for 5 days, 10 days, and 6 months, and 
in dogs for 5 days, the Cmax and AUC from time 0 to 24 hours after the end of a 30-min infusion (AUC0-24) 
increased approximately dose proportionally in the tested dose range of 1 to 75 mg/kg/day in rats and 15 to 40 
mg/kg/day in dogs. No apparent sex-related difference was observed in rats or dogs. 
Distribution 
Rucaparib showed moderate plasma protein binding. The average protein binding in mouse, rat, dog, and 
human plasma was 61.9%, 56.4%, 66.8%, and 70.2%, respectively. At 100 µM in dog and human plasma, 
rucaparib protein binding was 49.5% and 54.6%, respectively, less than that observed at lower concentrations. 
Rucaparib showed high distribution volume with Vss of 6.14, 6.5, and 15.2 L/kg in mouse, rat and dog, 
respectively. The Vss values correspond to 8.5, 9.7, and 25.2 times total body water in respective species. This 
is consistent with the preferential rucaparib distribution in RBCs (RBC-to-plasma ratios of 2.26 to 5.85 in mice, 
4.37 in rats, and 5.21 in dogs) and wide tissue distribution in rats. 
The [14C]rucaparib-derived radioactivity was well distributed in most tissues in rats following an oral dose of 
[14C]rucaparib with tissue concentrations higher than blood at all time-points, consistent with the large 
distribution volume of rucaparib. The tissues with the highest concentrations were cecum, kidney medulla, 
adrenal gland medulla, stomach, liver, and small intestine. The tissues with [14C] concentrations similar to 
blood were Harderian gland, eye uvea, mammary gland region, blood, bone, testis, white adipose, and eye lens. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 27/167 
  
  
Spinal cord and brain had very low [14C] concentrations, suggesting minimal passage of rucaparib-derived 
radioactivity through the blood-brain barrier. Tissue concentrations in male and female SD rats decreased 
steadily and the concentrations in most tissues were BLQ at 72 hours post-dose, except for excretory organs 
(liver and kidney), adrenal gland, testis, uterus, and ovary. The concentrations in those tissues were low and 
near the LLOQ, which indicated that complete elimination was expected. 
Following a single PO dose of [14C]rucaparib in male pigmented LE rats, the radioactivity distribution pattern in 
pigmented and albino rats was qualitatively similar, with the exception of the uveal pigment of the eyes and the 
pigmented skin where a higher concentration of radioactivity was observed, suggesting an association of 
radioactive drug-related material with melanin. At 168 hours (7 days) and 1200 hours (50 days, last time-point) 
after dosing, radioactivity was still detectable in the pigmented skin and uveal pigment of the eyes, respectively. 
However, rucaparib was not phototoxic (eye and skin evaluated) following 5-day repeat PO dose administration 
to LE pigmented rats at 750 mg/kg/day. 
Metabolism 
“In vitro”, rucaparib showed greater metabolic stability in human (67% remaining), monkey (94% remaining), 
and rat (97 % remaining) liver microsomes compared with those of the mouse (NA) and dog (57% remaining). 
In an in vitro CYP phenotyping study, recombinant human CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, 
contributed to the oxidative metabolism of rucaparib. The main metabolite identified in vitro in human 
hepatocytes, M324 (Phase I deamination and oxidation product), was also present in rat, dog, and monkey 
hepatocytes. The metabolites of rucaparib were profiled in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and beagle dogs following 
a single PO dose of [14C]rucaparib. No marked sex-related difference was observed. In rats, M324 and 
rucaparib were the major species, accounting for 48.0% and 32.9-40.8% of total radioactivity in pooled plasma, 
respectively; 27.2-34.4% and 60.9-72.8% in pooled urine, respectively; and 10.9-11.4% and 82.3-89.1% in 
pooled faeces, respectively. In pooled bile from BDC rats, Phase II metabolites (sulfation and glucuronidation 
products) and M324 were the major species, accounting for approximately 52.1-64.1% and 30.7-40.0% of total 
recovered radioactivity, respectively. In dogs, rucaparib and M309 (N-demethylation product) were the main 
species in the plasma and urine, accounting for 36.5-39.0% and 37.3-63.5% of total radioactivity in pooled 
plasma, respectively; and 46.9-58.1% and 30.9-41.8% in pooled urine, respectively. M324 was a relatively 
minor species in plasma and urine. In faeces, M324 and rucaparib were the major species, accounting for 
41.8-53.8% and 28.8-29.0% of total radioactivity in pooled faeces, respectively. In patients with a solid tumour, 
preliminary metabolite profiling following repeated PO doses of 600 mg rucaparib BID (no 14C isotope label) 
suggested that rucaparib, M324, and M338 (phase II metabolite, subsequent N-methylation product of M324) 
were the major species in the plasma, accounting for 43.5-55.1%, 16.8-20.0%, and 12.8-24.9% of total 
rucaparib-related peak areas in the pooled plasma samples, respectively.  
Excretion 
Following oral administration of [14C]rucaparib, radioactivity was almost completely excreted in 7 days with the 
majority excreted in the first 24-48 hours. Faecal excretion was the major elimination pathway, with the mean 
dose recovery of 93.9% and 89% in rats and dogs, respectively, and urinary excretion was a minor pathway 
(approximately 6% in the rat and dog). Bile excretion accounted for 21.5-32.0% of the radioactive dose in male 
and female BDC rats, respectively.

Pharmacokinetics Drug Interactions 
In vitro, rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, 
CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down-regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human 
hepatocytes at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In vitro, rucaparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3, or renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2. 
Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K, and a moderate inhibitor of OCT1. Also, rucaparib has the 
potential to inhibit P-gp in the gut and BCRP in the gut, liver and kidney. At clinical exposures, rucaparib did not 
inhibit MRP2, MRP3, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 or OAT3. Rucaparib inhibits MRP4 with an IC50 of 242 µM 
which is ~1/3 of the Cmax reached in the gut. This IC50/Cmax for MRP4 inhibition is clinically relevant. This 
information has been included in the section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Inhibition of MRP3 and MRP2 transporters by rucaparib was tested up to 300 µM. However, this concentration is 
lower than the Cmax reached in the gut of patients. In an additional in vitro study  evaluating the potential of 
rucaparib to inhibit MRP2 and MRP3 at higher rucaparib concentrations, the effects of rucaparib at 
concentrations up to 4 mM on MRP2 and MRP3-mediated transport of β-estradiol-17-β-D-glucuronide (E217βG) 
were tested using inside-out vesicles expressing human MRP2 and MRP3. Rucaparib showed biphasic effects on 
MRP2 activity. At lower concentrations (148 to 1333 μM), mild increase in MRP2 activity was observed (up to 
77% increase at 444 μM). At the top concentration of 4 mM, mild (48%) inhibition was observed. The 
theoretically calculated rucaparib concentration in the gut is high following a 600 mg dose (0.24 mg/ml or 0.742 
mM) assumed total dissolution in 250 mL intestinal fluid. Rucaparib showed concentration-dependent inhibition 
of MRP3 with an IC50 determined to be 899.5 μM (0.29 mg/ml). As rucaparib concentration in enterocytes is 
expected to be lower, the in vitro inhibition study suggested no interaction of rucaparib with MRP3 at relevant 
clinical exposure. Rucaparib inhibits MRP4 with an IC50 of 242 µM which is ~3 fold lower than the Cmax reached 
in the gut. These results have been adequately included in the SmPC, section 5.2. 
Additionally, rucaparib inhibited OCT2 with an IC50 of 31 µM suggesting potential in vivo OCT2 inhibition.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Administration of rucaparib camsylate via oral gavage was generally well-tolerated in rats given 100, 500, or 
2000 mg/kg as a single dose. No rucaparib-related deaths or clinical signs occurred. However, body weight gain 
and correlating food consumption were negatively affected, especially in females at 2000 mg/kg. Consequently, 
2000 mg/kg/day was considered an unacceptable dose level. Rucaparib phosphate was given to male dogs as a 
single dose via oral gavage in an escalating dose regimen at 5, 30, 60, 125, and 250 mg/kg. At ≥60 mg/kg, 
clinical signs were emesis and abnormal faeces (non-formed, discoloured, mucoid or watery). In addition, the 
dog given 250 mg/kg was cold to the touch. Haematological changes included increased reticulocyte counts at 
all doses. A subsequent GLP single-dose study was conducted in which the mid and high doses were lowered and 
TK was evaluated. Rucaparib phosphate was given via oral gavage at 5, 20, and 75 mg/kg. It was generally well 
tolerated at doses up to 75 mg/kg with findings of abnormal faeces and emesis. There were no changes in body 
weight or food consumption, clinical pathology parameters, including troponin I, or anatomic pathology. The 
highest tested dose, 75 mg/kg, was defined as the NOAEL, which corresponded to a mean combined male and 
female Cmax of 1530 ng/mL and AUC0-24 of 8750 ng·hr/mL.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Oral administration 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rat there were no deaths following a single PO dose of 2000 
mg/kg/day (approximately 92% of the human AUC) and rucaparib was generally well tolerated. Decreased body 
weight gain that correlated with lower food consumption was evident at 2000 mg/kg/day. After 7 days of 
treatment, there was one death at 1000 mg/kg/day that was potentially rucaparib related. Decreased body 
weight gain that correlated with lower food consumption was noted at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day in males. Haematologic 
changes as well as tissue alterations involving bone marrow and lymphoid tissues were observed. In the 28-day 
study, there was a death at 150 mg/kg/day (potentially rucaparib related) and two deaths at the high dose of 
500 mg/kg/day (approximately 58-82% of human AUC). Deaths at 500 mg/kg were attributed to marked 
anaemia based on haematologic and histologic data and were attributed to rucaparib treatment. Reversible 
clinical signs at ≥ 150 mg/kg/day included thinning hair coat and pale eyes. Decreased body weight gain that 
correlated with lower food consumption was seen at ≥ 50 mg/kg, but was only considered adverse at 500 
mg/kg. No clinical signs in the 13-week study occurred at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. Decreases in mean body 
weight and body weight gain at ≥ 40 mg/kg/day correlated with lower food consumption. By the end of the 
recovery period, mean body weight remained lower at ≥ 40 mg/kg/day. At ≥ 40 mg/kg/day, findings similar to 
those from the 28-day study were observed, including reversible haematologic changes and tissue alterations 
involving bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. In these repeat-dose studies all haematopoietic cell lineages of the 
bone marrow were affected by rucaparib administration, with the erythroid lineage altered the most 
consistently. 
In the dog, rucaparib associated moribund sacrifice occurred at 40 mg/kg/day (which is approximately 12% of 
human AUC) on Day 18 in the 91-day study. The common clinical presentation in all single and repeat dose 
studies was abnormal faeces. Emesis was also seen in conjunction with abnormal faeces in the single dose (75 
mg/kg/day) and 7-day (80 mg/kg/day) studies. In an initial 7-day in which rucaparib was given as a suspension 
by oral gavage, no effects on body weight or food consumption were observed. In a subsequent 7-day study in 
which rucaparib was given orally by capsules, body weight loss and reduced food consumption were noted at 80 
mg/kg/day. The high dose in the follow-up 30-day study was set at 75 mg/kg/day. Body weight loss was present 
early in the dosing phase, but not at study termination, even though food consumption was decreased at 75 
mg/kg/day. In the 91-day study, body weight loss and inappetence occurred at the high dose of 40 mg/kg/day. 
These findings, coupled with a death at 40 mg/kg/day, led to dose reduction to 20 mg/kg/day on Day 27. 
The profile of haematologic changes in all repeat-dose studies in the dog was comparable to that seen in the rat. 
A consistent signal indicating a rucaparib-related effect on haematopoietic tissue was reductions in 
reticulocytes. Like the rat, all haematopoietic cell lineages of the bone marrow were affected by rucaparib 
administration, with erythropoietic tissue being affected most consistently. These haematologic changes 
correlated with histologic findings that revealed bone marrow hypocellularity and lymphocyte depletion 
involving one or more lymphoid tissues. The main target organs identified for both species in the general 
toxicology oral program involved the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphopoietic systems.

Intravenous administration 
In the GLP 5-day IV study, rats were given daily 30-minute IV infusions of rucaparib phosphate at 5, 15, or 75 
mg/kg/day. Rucaparib-related effects included dose-related clinical signs (decreased activity, weakness, lateral 
recumbency, laboured breathing, swelling, poor tail condition) and transient, slight reductions in body 
temperature (75 mg/kg/day). Haematology effects observed at 75 mg/kg/day on Day 6 included increased 
neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes, monocytes and erythroid parameters (RBC counts, reticulocytes, 
haemoglobin, haematocrit). Males given 75 mg/kg/day also had decreased platelet counts on Day 6. Decreased 
albumin and increased globulin levels, accompanied by decreased albumin/globulin ratios, were noted at 75 
mg/kg/day on Day 6. These changes were related to the tissue injury at the infusion site in both main study and 
recovery animals, which was observed primarily at 75 mg/kg/day. Dose-related microscopic findings included 
bone marrow hypocellularity, lymphoid atrophy in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, and thymic 
atrophy (correlated with decreased thymic weights at 75 mg/kg/day). Minimal to moderate myocardial 
degeneration, necrosis, and fibroplasia usually located at the apex of the heart were observed in males at 75 
mg/kg/day. No associated changes in troponin T levels were noted on Day 6. The NOAEL for rucaparib in this 
study was considered to be 5 mg/kg/day, which corresponded to a mean combined male and female Cmax and 
AUC0-24.5 of 672 ng/mL and 992 ng·hr/mL, respectively. 
Administration of rucaparib was well-tolerated clinically up to 15 mg/kg/day when administered via 30-minute 
IV infusion to rats for two repeat-dosing cycles of 5 consecutive days of dosing each. Rucaparib-related adverse 
effects on body weight, body weight gain, and food consumption were noted in males given 45 mg/kg/day. The 
moribund sacrifice of one TK female given 45 mg/kg/day was of uncertain relationship to rucaparib. Also at 45 
mg/kg/day, rucaparib-related, adverse tissue injury at the catheter and/or infusion sites and decreased 
erythropoiesis in bone marrow were noted at necropsy and persisted in some animals following the recovery 
phase. In addition, rucaparib-related adverse (but reversible) depletion of lymphocytes in the thymus was noted 
in animals given 45 mg/kg/day and correlated with decreased thymic weights. The NOAEL was 15 mg/kg/day, 
which corresponded to a mean combined male and female and Cmax and AUC0-24.5 from Day 12 of the dosing 
phase of 2670 ng/mL and 6560 ng·hr/mL, respectively. 
IV infusion of rucaparib to rats over 30 minutes at 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg/day once daily for 5 consecutive days, 
followed by a rest period of 23 days, for 6 treatment cycles, was associated with a decrease in reticulocyte count 
in both sexes at 15 mg/kg/day, a decrease in lymphocyte count in males at 15 mg/kg/day, a slight decrease in 
thymus weights at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day in males and at 15 mg/kg/day in females and a minimal generalized depletion 
of the bone marrow in males at 15 mg/kg/day, on completion of the 6th treatment cycle (Day 145). None of 
these changes was evident in the animals euthanized after the 23-day rest period (Day 169), indicating 
complete recovery. The NOEL in this study was considered 5 mg/kg/day, which corresponded to a mean 
combined male and female Cmax of 578.9 ng/mL and AUC0-24 of 882 ng·hr/mL. 
In a repeat-dose GLP study, dogs were infused IV for 30-minutes over 5 consecutive days at 15, 25, or 40 
mg/kg/day of rucaparib phosphate followed by 24 days of recovery. Deaths occurred at 40 mg/kg/day. 
Dose-related clinical observations included; decreased activity, defecation, increased respiratory rate, lateral 
recumbency, salivation, retching, vomiting, tremors and red skin discoloration. At 40 mg/kg/day, ECG 
abnormalities (persistent sinus tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal rhythm) were noted. Dose-related reversible 
reductions in platelets and reticulocytes were seen. Thymus weights were decreased across all groups. Dark 
discoloration in the left ventricular endocardium correlated with endocardial haemorrhage detected 
microscopically with a higher incidence in animals at 40 mg/kg/day. These cardiac changes were reversible. 
Reversible, dose-related (≥ 25 mg/kg/day) bone marrow hypocellularity, thymic atrophy and lymphoid atrophy 
of GALT were additional histologic changes. Although infusion site injury detected across all groups was related

to experimental procedure, infusion site thrombosis at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day was rucaparib-related. A NOAEL was not 
established. Effects on Day 5 at 15 mg/kg/day, which corresponded to a mean Cmax of 3602 and 3956 ng/mL and 
AUC0-24.5 of 4724 and 5917 ng·hr/mL for males and females, respectively, were generally mild and well 
tolerated. 
Genotoxicity 
Rucaparib was not genotoxic in four Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains, but was a weak 
bacterial mutagen in a single strain, TA98, in the absence of metabolic activation. Rucaparib induced 
chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes, with or without metabolic activation.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Male reproductive assessment was included as part of the 3-month repeat-dose studies in rat and dog. In these 
studies, there were no rucaparib-related effects on sperm total count, density, motility, or morphology in either 
species at 100 mg/kg/day in the rat (approximately 29% of human AUC) and 20 mg/kg/day in the dog 
(approximately 9% of human AUC). Thus exposures at the tolerated doses of rucaparib used in the 91-day 
toxicity studies in rat and dog may be inadequate to assess the effects on spermatogenesis in humans. In three 
repeat-dose studies equivocal microscopic testicular changes were observed in the rat at 1000 mg/kg/day and 
at all doses (5 to 80 mg/kg/day) in the dog, as well as some of the control dogs. The female reproductive organs 
were not identified as target organs in the repeat-dose studies with rucaparib in dog or rat. However, the 
exposures showed in these studies do not provided sufficient safety margin. Therefore, based on the animal 
studies, impact on fertility associated with the use of rucaparib cannot be ruled out. Moreover, based on 
published studies rucaparib, as a PARP inhibitor, has the potential to impair spermatogenesis and reduce fertility 
at clinically relevant exposures in patients treated with 600 mg BID.

Rucaparib caused maternal toxicity in rats at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day in a dose range finding embryo-foetal 
development study. Pregnancy occurred in all rats and dose groups. There was a 100% post-implantation loss 
in all rucaparib-treated groups (100% early resorptions) even at the lowest dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Rucaparib is 
a developmental toxicant as it was embryotoxic at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day. Rucaparib effects on embryo-foetal survival 
are an expected outcome, consistent with the pharmacologic blockade of PARP-1 and PARP-2. Thus rucaparib 
has the potential to cause embryo or foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rucaparib should not 
be used during pregnancy. Appropriate warnings and precautions regarding use during pregnancy or 
breast-feeding are provided in the SmPC (Section 4.6). Females of childbearing potential are advised to use 
effective contraception during treatment with rucaparib and for 6 months after the final dose. The findings of 
embryo-toxicity have been included in section 5.3 (Preclinical safety data) of the SmPC. 
As per ICH S9, pre-and postnatal toxicology studies are generally not warranted to support marketing of 
pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. 
Juvenile toxicity investigations are not applicable for rucaparib, since relapsed ovarian cancer is unlikely to occur 
in the paediatric population. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Following repeat oral administration, Tmax was variable in both rat and dog, ranging from 2 to 8 and 1 to 7 hours, 
respectively. In rats, systemic exposure, as measured by Cmax and AUC0-24, increased approximately dose 
proportionally between 10 and 40 mg/kg/day and less than dose proportionally in the tested dose range of 40 
to 1000 mg/kg/day. In dogs, systemic exposure, as measured by Cmax and AUC0-24, were slightly less than dose 
proportional in the tested dose range of 10 to 80 mg/kg/day. There were generally no sex-related differences in 
the exposure to rucaparib. Following repeated dosing, there was no apparent accumulation of rucaparib and T1/2 
was not changed. 
Following once daily 30-min IV infusion of rucaparib phosphate in rats for 5 days, 10 days, and 6 months, and 
in dogs for 5 days, the Cmax and AUC0-24 after the end of a 30-min infusion increased approximately dose 
proportionally in the tested dose range of 1 to 75 mg/kg/day in rats and 15 to 40 mg/kg/day in dogs. No 
apparent sex-related difference was observed in rats or dogs. 
Local Tolerance 
Since the clinical route of administration of rucaparib is oral, the oral tolerance of rucaparib was evaluated in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and dog. In the dog, emesis and abnormal stools occurred at doses from 60 
to 80 mg/kg in single-dose and 7-day studies and non-formed faeces in males given ≥3 mg/kg/day in the 
91-day study. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
According to ICH S8 guideline the potential immunotoxicity of rucaparib has been investigated in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Changes in the haematopoietic and lymphopoietic systems were 
observed. Furthermore, these effects on the immune system were reversible based on detailed haematologic 
and histologic assessments of haematopoietic and lymphopoietic tissues. Importantly, the rucaparib-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 33/167 
  
  
nonclinical findings on the immune system have been predictive of effects associated with immunosuppression 
and consequent adverse effects in patients. 
Metabolites 
The major metabolite observed in all the species was the oxidative deamination product M324. However 
metabolite M338, which is a Phase II N-methylated product of M324, was tentatively identified in patient plasma 
only. In patients with a solid tumour (Study CO-338-010), preliminary metabolite profiling following repeated 
PO doses of 600 mg rucaparib BID (no 14C isotope label) suggested that rucaparib, M324, and M338 (phase II 
metabolite, subsequent N-methylation product of M324) were the major species in the plasma, accounting for 
43.5-55.1%, 16.8-20.0%, and 12.8-24.9% of total rucaparib-related peak areas in the pooled plasma samples, 
respectively. Taking into account the preliminary metabolite profiling results from Study CO-338-010, where 
patients received repeated oral doses of 600 mg rucaparib BID without [14C] label, the exposures of M324 and 
M338 metabolites could result greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure in human plasma. Therefore, 
these metabolites should be characterized. The metabolism of rucaparib is being further assessed in an ongoing 
definitive [14C]rucaparib study in cancer patients. Once the results of the mass balance and metabolite profiling 
study in patients are available it is recommended that the applicant submits them and assesses if further 
investigation of rucaparib metabolites is warranted. Impurities 
One process related impurity was observed using the commercial manufacturing process for rucaparib 
camsylate. This impurity was present in toxicology batches of rucaparib camsylate at levels of 0.2% to 0.3% a/a 
and in early clinical batches in the range of 0.1% to 0.2% a/a. As per ICH S9 and ICH Q3A guidelines, 
establishing alternative impurity acceptance criteria is justified by considering the patient population and the 
disease being treated. Based on this approach, the process related impurity was qualified at 0.1% in female 
dogs in the 91-day study. ICH guideline Q3A also states that the level of any impurity present in a new drug 
substance that has been adequately tested in clinical studies is considered qualified. The impurity was present 
in a drug product batch at a level of 0.18% and used in clinical study CO-338-010; thus a level of 0.18% is 
considered qualified based on clinical exposure. In addition, based on the comparative DEREK (Q)SAR 
assessment of rucaparib and impurity, the impurity should be considered to present no additional or 
qualitatively different risk of genotoxicity. 
Phototoxicity 
A phototoxicity study of rucaparib was conducted in Long-Evans (LE) pigmented rats given rucaparib camsylate 
via oral gavage for 5 days at a dose of up to 750 mg/kg/day, using a study design consistent with guidance ICH 
S10 “Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals”. Administration of rucaparib and control article to LE 
pigmented rats elicited no skin reactions or ocular reactions indicative of phototoxicity. The lack of ocular 
reactions was confirmed by histopathological evaluation. The group of rats administered the comparator article, 
8-MOP, showed skin reactions (erythema, oedema and/or flaking) and ocular observations (bilateral diffuse 
corneal oedema, internal structures were not visible, confirmed by histopathological evaluation) indicative of 
phototoxicity. 
Rucaparib camsylate was not found to be phototoxic in this study. The mean plasma rucaparib concentration 
was 1513 ng/mL. This was 78% of the mean steady-state Cmax in patients following 600 mg rucaparib BID, at 
which photosensitivity has been reported in <15% of patients.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the Phase I screening environmental risk assessment for rucaparib, the refined PECSURFACEWATER for 
rucaparib was calculated as 13.8 ng/L, using a refined Fpen for the target patient population. The Fpen has been 
recalculated using ovarian cancer prevalence data and population for Latvia, the member state with the highest 
prevalence of the disease for the year 2012. As the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is exceeded, further risk assessment 
in Phase II of the procedure is required. The Applicant has decided to initiate a Phase II Tier A assessment. 
The octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) was estimated using a validated and recognized method “Shake 
Flask Method” according to the OECD 107. The log Kow value presented by the applicant for rucaparib is 0.71, 
which is below the trigger value of 4.5 for conducting a PBT assessment (see table 2 below).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Rucaparib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of PARP enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3, which is 
developed as an oral monotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have been identified as having 
a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene based on analysis of DNA extracted from tumour tissue. 
In vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology studies showed that rucaparib is a selective, small molecule inhibitor 
of PARP enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. Consistent with the concept of synthetic lethality, 
rucaparib showed in vitro activity as a single agent in BRCA1/2 mutant cell lines by inhibiting proliferation and 
in vivo activity, in mouse xenograft models. PARP inhibition of mutant BRCA cells is associated with PAR 
inhibition, with a concomitant increase in DNA damage, caspase 3/7 levels, and cell death. Overall, in vitro 
studies have shown that the mechanism of action of rucaparib involves PARP enzyme inhibition and PARP-DNA 
complex formation or trapping.

The results from the cancer cell lines studies confirm rucaparib’s activity in BRCA mutant cancers, and are 
consistent with nonclinical and clinical studies showing that BRCA1/2 mutations confer sensitivity to PARP 
inhibitors in multiple cancer types.  
PK/PD studies were performed in subcutaneous and orthotopic MDA-MD-436 (BRCA1 mutant) TNBC xenograft 
models. The results of these studies suggest that the mechanism of action of rucaparib may include high and/or 
sustained rucaparib levels in the tumour. Significant anti-tumour efficacy was observed in 4 out of 5 xenograft 
models with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (MDA-MB-436, HBCx-17, PAXF 2005, and PAXF 2094). In addition, 
significant anti-tumour activity was observed in the BRCA wild-type HBCx-6 model. 
Taken together, rucaparib showed durable in vivo efficacy in multiple BRCA1/2 mutant models. Rucaparib was 
also active in a BRCA wild-type model, consistent with in vitro data suggesting that rucaparib is active in cells 
with other deficits in HRR through synthetic lethality. 
The results from the secondary PD studies suggest that rucaparib has a limited potential for off-target effects in 
humans. 
Safety pharmacology studies suggest oral dosing of rucaparib poses a low risk of causing cardiac, 
neurobehavioral, or respiratory function effects in patients. However, safety pharmacology endpoints were 
incorporated into study designs for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and dog. Based on data of 
pivotal studies cardiovascular effects associated to rucaparib oral treatment in patients cannot be ruled out (see 
discussion below). Data from the safety pharmacology suggest that rucaparib exposures in the brain of patients 
are expected to be low. 
The results of pharmacology studies are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of rucaparib and 
support its use as an oral monotherapy for patients with BRCA1/2 mutation-positive advanced cancers.  
The rat and dog were considered relevant species for the general toxicology studies which was supported by in 
vitro data with cryopreserved hepatocytes showing that the metabolite profiles in SD rats, beagle dogs, and 
humans were similar. 
The absolute oral bioavailability of rucaparib was 17%, 22%, and 74-75% in mice, rats, and dogs respectively. 
Rucaparib showed moderate plasma protein binding and a high distribution volume with in mouse, rat and dog. 
This is consistent with the wide tissue distribution in rats. The terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) following IV 
dosing was 1.3, 3.5, and 4.5 hours in mice, rats, and dogs, respectively. 
Following daily repeat oral administration, the Tmax was variable in both rat and dog and ranged from 2 to 8 and 
1 to 7 hours, respectively. In rats, the systemic exposure (as measured by Cmax and AUC0-24), increased 
approximately dose proportionally between 10 and 40 mg/kg/day but less than dose proportionally between 40 
to 1000 mg/kg/day. In dogs, the systemic exposure was slightly less than dose proportional between 10 to 80 
mg/kg/day. There were generally no gender related differences in the exposure to rucaparib. Following repeated 
dosing, there was no apparent accumulation of rucaparib and T1/2 was unchanged. 
Following a single PO dose of [14C]rucaparib in male and female SD rats, rucaparib-derived radioactivity was 
well distributed into tissues with concentrations higher than that in blood at all monitored time points. 
Concentrations in most tissues were below or near the lower limit of quantification by 7 days post-dose (last 
time-point). Rucaparib showed minimal penetration of rucaparib-derived radioactivity through the blood-brain 
barrier. Rucaparib appeared to preferentially distribute into tumours in a cancer xenograft model. 
In vitro data suggested slow metabolism by CYP enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 contributed to the metabolism of rucaparib. In vivo metabolite profiling in rats, dogs, and patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 36/167 
  
  
showed that a carboxylic acid metabolite (M324) is a common major metabolite in all three species. A Phase II 
N-methylated metabolite of M324 (M338) was only observed in patients. Consequently this entity has not been 
tested for general toxicity or genotoxicity in the non-clinical studies. It is acknowledged that in the intended 
patient population a separate non-clinical evaluation of metabolites is generally not warranted. However, taking 
into account the preliminary metabolite profiling results from Study CO-338-010, where patients received 
repeated oral doses of 600 mg rucaparib BID without [14C] label, the exposures of M324 and M338 metabolites 
could result greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure in human plasma and, based on the structure of 
the metabolite an assessment of its potential toxicity should be made. The metabolism of rucaparib is being 
further assessed in an ongoing definitive [14C]rucaparib study in cancer patients. Once the results of the mass 
balance and metabolite profiling study in patients are available the Applicant is recommended to submit the 
results of the mass balance and metabolite profiling study and assess if further investigation of rucaparib 
metabolites is warranted 
Following oral administration, faecal excretion was the major route of elimination in the rat and dog. The 
majority of drug related radioactivity was recovered 24 hours (rat) or 48 hours (dog) following drug 
administration. 
In vitro, rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, 
CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down-regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human 
hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. 
In vitro, rucaparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3, or renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2. 
Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K, and a moderate inhibitor of OCT1. Also, rucaparib has the 
potential to inhibit P-gp in the gut and BCRP in the gut, liver and kidney. At clinical exposures, rucaparib did not 
inhibit MRP2, MRP3, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 or OAT3. For MRP4 inhibition, the IC50/Cmax  is clinically 
relevant. This information has been included in the section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
No interaction with MRP2 or MRP3 was observed in vitro at the clinical exposure of rucaparib, however, mild 
bi-phasic activation and inhibition of MRP2 and concentration dependent inhibition of MRP3 were observed at 
concentrations higher than observed plasma Cmax of rucaparib.  
Additionally, rucaparib inhibited OCT2 with an IC50 of 31 µM suggesting potential in vivo OCT2 inhibition.  
No drug-drug interaction studies with metabolites have been submitted. Once the results of the mass balance 
and metabolite profiling study in patients are available interaction studies should be performed with all 
metabolites observed at exposures greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure. 
Based on repeated-dose oral toxicity studies in the rat and dog, the non-clinical toxicity of rucaparib was 
characterised and determined to be similar in both test animal species. Target organs of toxicity involved the 
haematopoietic, lymphopoietic and GIT systems. In general, the toxicities induced in rats and dogs reversed 
after a four week period of rucaparib withdrawal. Importantly, no additional targets were identified in animals 
following prolonged oral dosing (3 months). 
The toxicology findings were compared to the adverse events (AEs) observed in patients treated with 600 mg 
BID rucaparib. The AEs in patients treated with rucaparib involved the haematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and 
gastrointestinal systems and demonstrated that findings from toxicology species were generally predictive for 
humans. Gastrointestinal effects in the dog manifested principally as clinical signs (emesis, diarrhoea), but were 
not dose-limiting and did not affect the general health of the animals. Similarly, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea 
were observed in 74.8%, 45.2%, and 33.7% of patients treated with rucaparib, respectively. Decreases in body

Page 37/167 
  
  
weight and food consumption occurred in the rat and dog. Consistent with these findings, decreases in appetite 
were also observed in patients. In toxicology studies, haematologic and histopathologic findings demonstrated 
hypocellularity of the bone marrow. In general, reduction in cellularity of haematopoietic and lymphopoietic 
tissues correlated with changes in haematologic parameters and thus these effects can be readily monitored 
clinically. Considering the dog and rat data collectively, it was evident that all cell lineages could be affected by 
rucaparib administration, but that erythroid tissues were most susceptible to rucaparib effects. Marked anaemia 
was noted in rats at 500 mg/kg. Similarly anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin were reported in 24.9% 
of patients treated with 600 mg BID rucaparib. In addition, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 
3.2% and 5.4% of patients, respectively. The potential for rucaparib to induce changes in the cardiovascular 
system was assessed non-clinically in vitro and in vivo. Cardiovascular effects were observed in rats and dogs 
treated with rucaparib after intravenous administration. Taking into account that Cmax and AUCs reached after 
oral administration in animals do not suppose a safety margin for patients at clinically relevant doses, 
cardiovascular effects associated to rucaparib oral treatment cannot be ruled out.  
Rucaparib was not mutagenic in an Ames assay and was clastogenic in vitro. The latter result is consistent with 
the mechanism of action of rucaparib. 
Carcinogenicity studies using rucaparib were not submitted in accordance with ICH S9. 
Male reproductive assessment was included as part of the 3-month repeat-dose studies in rat and dog. In these 
studies, there were no rucaparib-related effects on sperm total count, density, motility, or morphology in either 
species at 100 mg/kg/day in the rat (approximately 29% of human AUC) and 20 mg/kg/day in the dog 
(approximately 9% of human AUC). Thus exposures at the tolerated doses of rucaparib used in the 91-day 
toxicity studies in rat and dog may be inadequate to assess the effects on spermatogenesis in humans. In three 
repeat-dose studies equivocal microscopic testicular changes were observed in the rat at 1000 mg/kg/day and 
at all doses (5 to 80 mg/kg/day) in the dog, as well as some of the control dogs. The female reproductive organs 
were not identified as target organs in the repeat-dose studies with rucaparib in dog or rat. However, the 
exposures showed in these studies do not provided sufficient safety margin. Therefore, based on the animal 
studies, impact on fertility associated with the use of rucaparib cannot be ruled out. Moreover, based on 
published studies, rucaparib, as a PARP inhibitor, has the potential to impair spermatogenesis and reduce 
fertility at clinically relevant exposures in patients treated with 600 mg BID. 
Rucaparib caused maternal toxicity in rats at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day in a dose range finding embryo-foetal 
development study. Pregnancy occurred in all rats and dose groups. There was a 100% post-implantation loss 
in all rucaparib-treated groups (100% early resorptions) even at the lowest dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Rucaparib is 
a developmental toxicant as it was embryotoxic at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day. Rucaparib effects on embryo-foetal survival 
are an expected outcome, consistent with the pharmacologic blockade of PARP-1 and PARP-2. Thus rucaparib 
has the potential to cause embryo or foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rucaparib should not 
be used during pregnancy. Appropriate warnings and precautions regarding use during pregnancy or 
breast-feeding are provided in the Summary of Product Characteristics (Section 4.6). Females of childbearing 
potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with rucaparib and for 6 months after the 
final dose. The finding of embryo-toxicity has been included in section 5.3 Preclinical safety data of the SmPC 
(SmPC text: In an embryo-foetal development study in rats, rucaparib was associated with post-implantation 
loss at exposures of approximately 0.04 times the human AUC at the recommended dose). 
As per ICH S9, pre-and postnatal toxicology studies were not submitted. 
Juvenile toxicity investigations are not applicable for rucaparib, since relapsed ovarian cancer is unlikely to occur 
in the paediatric population.

The lack of phototoxicity in LE pigmented rats could have been due to lower exposures. Considering the 
photosensitivity that has been reported in <15% of patients, a risk of phototoxicity cannot be ruled out in human 
at doses clinically relevant. In addition, using the search criteria that includes the MedDRA HLT (higher level 
term) of Photosensitivity and photodermatosis conditions, and the preferred terms of Photodermatosis, 
Photosensitivity reaction, Polymorphic light eruption, Solar dermatitis, and Sunburn, a total of 43 patients 
(10.5%) in the overall safety population and 15 patients (10.5%) with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer experienced 
photosensitivity (See clinical safety). 
Environmental Risk  
The log Kow value presented by the applicant for rucaparib is below the trigger value for conducting a PBT 
assessment. 
Further risk assessment in Phase II of the procedure is required and the Applicant has decided to initiate a Phase 
II Tier A assessment. The applicant is recommended to perform the ERA phase II studies. 
Implications of the assessment of non-clinical data for the Safety Specification of the Risk Management Plan 
(RMP) 
The main safety concerns identified in the non-clinical documentation include myelosuppression, nausea and 
vomiting. 
Risk of development of cardiac lesions in patients cannot be ruled out when rucaparib is given orally. 
A risk of phototoxicity cannot be ruled out. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Rucaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP 
3, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity involves 
inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and the trapping of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in increased DNA 
damage, apoptosis, and cell death. 
Rucaparib has been shown to have in vitro and in vivo anti-tumour activity in BRCA mutant cell lines through a 
mechanism known as synthetic lethality, whereby the loss of two DNA repair pathways is required for cell death. 
The findings in nonclinical toxicology studies performed with oral rucaparib were generally consistent with the 
adverse events observed in clinical studies. In repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months duration in rats and 
dogs, the target organs were the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic, and lymphopoietic systems. These findings 
occurred at exposures below those observed in patients treated at the recommended dose, and were largely 
reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing. 
Although no cardiac effects were observed following oral dosing, based on the findings in the intravenous studies 
and safety margins, cardiac effects in patients cannot be excluded when rucaparib is given orally. 
No effects on male and female fertility were observed general toxicology studies in rats and dogs. However, a 
potential risk on human fertility cannot be ruled out based on the safety margin observed, and according to 
rucaparib’s mechanism of action (SmPC 4.6). 
Based on its mechanism of action and preclinical data, rucaparib may cause foetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman. Relevant wording in the SmPC states that rucaparib should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with it (SmPC 4.6).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Rucaparib has been formulated in a film-coated tablet containing rucaparib camsylate and is available in 200, 
250, and 300 mg tablet strengths. The recommended clinical dose is 600 mg BID.  
The drug substance has an equilibrium solubility of 1.4 mg active/mL in water at 25°C, 1.7 mg active/mL in 
water at 37°C. Aqueous solubility is not pH-dependent between pH 3 to 7. Solubility is lower at pH 1 and 2 and 
is dependent on the type of acid used to adjust solution pH. Drug solubility in vitro was reduced by the presence 
of chloride ions. Solubility is higher in biorelevant media with a significant increase in fed state intestinal fluid 
(FeSSiF) media. 
Rucaparib showed moderate/low permeability across a Caco-2 monolayer. Rucaparib showed higher 
permeability in the B-A direction than in the A-B direction, with ER values evaluated >2, indicating that there 
was active efflux of this compound in Caco-2 cell at all investigated concentrations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 41/167 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rucaparib has a half-life of 11- 30 hours. The accumulation ratio following BID dosing is 3.5 to 6.2, consistent 
with the elimination half-life. 
Pharmacokinetic data is available from 3 studies: an open-label dose escalation Phase 1 study of rucaparib in 
combination with chemotherapeutic regimens in adult patients with advanced solid tumours (Study A4991014), 
a Phase 1/2 study in patients with germline breast cancer gene (gBRCA) mutation cancers (Study CO-338-010) 
and a Phase 2 open-label study in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer (Study CO-338-017 [ARIEL2]). 
Methods 
The plasma concentration of rucaparib was determined using a validated high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. 
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
In Study A4991014, the mean absolute oral bioavailability following a single oral dose of 12 to 120 mg rucaparib 
was 36% (ranged 30.1% to 45.3%). 
In Study CO-338-010 Part 3, following 600 mg rucaparib BID dosing, the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC0-12 
were 1,940 ng/mL and 16,900 ng
hr/mL, respectively. Median Tmax was 1.92 hour. The Cmax/ lowest 
concentration of a drug just before the next dose (Ctrough) ratio was approximately 1.2. Steady state rucaparib 
exposures were achieved after approximately 1 week of rucaparib dosing. 
⋅
Bioequivalence 
During development, tablets of 12 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg tablet strengths (as active 
free base) encompassing 4 different formulations, and 12 mg phosphate powder, a sterile injectable 
formulation, were used in clinical studies. Tablets of 120 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, and 300 mg strengths are 
currently available. Only the 200 mg, 250 mg, and 300 mg tablet strengths are intended for commercialization.

Tablets of 12, 40, 60, and 120 mg strengths produced during development of rucaparib achieved greater than 
85% dissolution within 15 minutes, and tablets of 200 mg, 250 mg, and 300 mg strengths proposed for 
commercialization achieved greater than 95% dissolution within 15 minutes. Importantly, the 200 mg and 300 
mg strength tablets produced and tested by 2 different manufacturers achieved 97 to 103% release within 15 
minutes.In Study A4991014, administration of oral rucaparib using 12 mg (Formulation B), and 40 mg and 60 
mg strength tablets (Formulation C) did not appear to affect rucaparib PK, as demonstrated by similar Tmax, and 
dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC0-24. 
Similarly, in Study CO-338-010, rucaparib exposures as measured by Cmax, and AUC, increased approximately 
proportionally following QD (40 to 500 mg) and BID (240 to 840 mg) dosing using 40 mg (Formulation C), 60 mg 
(Formulation C), and 120 mg (Formulation D) strength tablets. 
The effect of tablet strength (40/60 mg, 120 mg, 200/300 mg) and formulation on rucaparib PK was assessed 
by PopPK analysis. Based on model-predicted exposures and observed Cmin,ss, there did not appear to be an 
effect of tablet strength on rucaparib exposures at the 600 mg rucaparib BID. The “notched” regions of the 
boxplots are overlapping, suggesting the medians may not be significantly different. 
Influence of food 
According to results of part 3 of Study CO-338-010, at the proposed clinical dose of 600 mg rucaparib, a high-fat 
meal increased the Cmax and AUC0-24 of rucaparib by approximately 20% and 38%, respectively, and delayed the 
Tmax by a median of 2.5 hours.

The effect of food on rucaparib PK was also assessed in the PopPK analyses. The oral bioavailability of rucaparib 
at doses > 480 mg with a high-fat meal, under fasted conditions, and with a meal of patient’s choice was 51.7%, 
32.6%, and 37.2%, respectively. The oral bioavailability of rucaparib at doses ≤ 480 mg with a high-fat meal or 
under fasted conditions was 29%. According to Figure 2, the impact of food effect on fasted and patient-selected 
meal groups is similar between 300 and 600 mg rucaparib BID, but higher exposures are achieved in the 
high-fat meal group at 600 mg relative to 300 mg. 
There is an increase (14.5%) on the bioavailability in the high-fat meal group with dose greater than 480 mg, vs 
patient’s choice group. However, there is an opposite effect (decrease of 8.2%) on bioavailability in the high-fat 
meals group with dose lower than 480 mg, vs patient’s choice group.

Distribution 
In vitro, rucaparib has moderate plasma protein binding of 70.2% at clinical exposures and [14C]rucaparib 
preferentially distributed into red blood cells (RBCs) with a blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.83. Rucaparib showed 
large steady state volume of distribution with Vss of 113 to 262 L following a single IV dose of 12 mg to 40 mg 
rucaparib, suggesting distribution to tissues. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Following a single IV dose of 12 to 40 mg rucaparib, the clearance (CL) ranged from 13.9 to 18.4 L/hr with a 
half-life of 17 hours. No data is available on Vss and CL following a single oral dose of 600 mg rucaparib. The 
mean half-life (T1/2) was 17 to 19 hours, following a single dose of rucaparib 600 mg. 
Metabolism 
In vitro data suggested slow metabolism by CYP enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism of rucaparib. 
Preliminary metabolite profiling was performed using steady state plasma samples collected from 3 patients in 
Study CO-338-010 treated with 600 mg rucaparib BID. The biotransformation pathways for rucaparib have been 
characterised as hydroxylation or oxidation, N-demethylation, deamination, and phase II methylation. 
Preliminary in vivo metabolite profiling in patient plasma suggested a carboxylic acid metabolite (M324, 32% to 
46% of rucaparib) and a Phase II N methylated metabolite of M324 (M338, 23% to 57% of rucaparib) as major 
metabolites. Metabolites M337c and M337d were proposed as oxidation, N-demethylation, and/or 
N-methylation products. Metabolites M339a and M339b were identified as hydroxylation or oxidation products. 
Metabolite, M309, was identified as N-demethylated rucaparib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 47/167 
  
  
The relative abundance of each metabolite was estimated by comparing the metabolite’s peak area with the sum 
of all rucaparib-related peak areas. 
Genetic polymorphism 
Study CO-338-017 (ARIEL2 study) collected different individuals with CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 phenotypes. The 
phenotypes data were evaluated in Population PK modelling as covariate. These covariates were not statistically 
significant during covariate analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 48/167 
  
  
 
 
Post- hoc estimates of rucaparib CL were compared among patients with different CYP1A2 and CYP2D2 
phenotypes. For CYP1A2, the CL values were comparable between normal metabolizers (n = 28) and 
hyper-inducers (n = 136). For CYP2D6, the CL values were largely overlapping among poor metabolizers (n = 
9), intermediate metabolizers (n = 71), normal metabolizers (n = 76), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (n = 4). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following rucaparib administration at 40 to 500 mg QD and 240 to 840 mg BID, the plasma exposures of 
rucaparib was approximately dose proportional. 
Following BID administration of 240 mg to 840 mg rucaparib, the mean accumulation of Cmax and AUC were in 
the range of 2.6 to 4.9 for Cmax, 3.5 to 6.2 for AUClast, and 1.47 to 5.44 for AUC0-12. Data provided do not allow 
comparison of different structural PK parameters (ka, CL, V1, etc) across time.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability on CL, estimated for all patients, was 48.8%. Inter-individual variability on Ka and 
D1, for patients in Study CO-338-010 Part 1 and Part 3, and study A4991014, were 63.5% and 111%, 
respectively. Proportional residual error was 38.2% and two different additive residual errors for intensive (0.83 
ng/mL) or sparse sampling (378.9 ng/mL) were estimated. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The clinical pharmacology investigation has been performed in patients. No investigations have been conducted 
in healthy volunteers.

Population PK model 
The PK model with sequential zero-order and first-order absorption and first-order elimination was selected. The 
initial model (run011) included estimates of inter individual variability (IIV) on clearance (CL/F), the absorption 
rate (Ka), the duration of the zero-order absorption (D1), and the relative bioavailability (F1). Relative 
bioavailability was fixed at 1 in the initial model. Assessment of rucaparib PK in cancer patients showed 
approximately dose-proportional exposure after QD or BID dosing, absorption with Cmax achieved within 1.5 to 
6 hours, and a large volume of distribution. The oral bioavailability was approximately 36% at 12 to 120 mg and 
T1/2 ranged from 11 to 29.8 hours. Rucaparib was moderately bound to human plasma proteins in vitro.

Special populations 
No formal studies have been performed with rucaparib neither in patients with renal impairment nor in patients 
with hepatic impairment.  
In the PopPK analyses, 147 (40%) patients had normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCL] ≥ 90 
mL/min); however, 40% (N = 149) and 20% (N = 76) had mild (CrCL 60 to 89 mL/min), and moderate (CrCL 
30 to 59 mL/min) renal function impairment. No measures of kidney function other than CrCL were taken in the 
clinical study. Following continuous 600 mg BID rucaparib dosing, the model-estimated steady-state AUC for 
patients with mild and moderate renal impairment was 15% and 33% higher than that of patients with normal 
renal function, respectively and no starting dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of rucaparib in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL/min or patients on 
dialysis are unknown. Rucaparib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment. 
In the PopPK analyses, most patients had normal hepatic function (91%, N = 337); however, 9.0% (N = 34) of 
patients had mild hepatic impairment. Following continuous 600 mg BID rucaparib dosing, the model-estimated 
steady-state AUC for patients with mild hepatic impairment was 9.3% smaller than that of patients with normal 
hepatic function therefore no starting dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Gender effect on PK was not conclusive as the majority of patients were female (96%). 
In the population of patients treated at 600 mg rucaparib BID, each non-White race was present at < 10% of the 
population, with 14 Asian patients and 8 Black patients treated. Following continuous 600 mg BID rucaparib 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 52/167 
  
  
 
dosing, the model-estimated steady-state AUC for Asian and Black patients was 0.8% and 38.8% higher than 
that of White patients, respectively. The small sample size prevents any meaningful conclusions. 
Baseline body weight (41 to 171 Kg) and BMI (17.3 to 58.5 Kg/m2) show no relationship with exposure. 
Age (20 to 86 years old) showed an apparent impact on exposure. However, no statistically significant effect of 
age was identified during the covariate search. 
Rucaparib is not indicated in children and adolescents. No data are available in this population. 
The Applicant provided the table with the PK parameters for each age group, as requested. Results from elderly 
+85 should be considered with caution as only one patient was enrolled in Studies CO-338-010 and 
CO-338-017. 
There are limited clinical data in patients aged 85 or over. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of other medicinal products on rucaparib 
In vitro:  
In vitro data suggested slow metabolism by CYP enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism of rucaparib.  
Rucaparib was shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of renal uptake transporters 
organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, and organic cation transporter (OCT) 2, or hepatic transporters 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (OAPT) 1B1 and OATP1B3.

In Silico - Population Pharmacokinetic:  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction (DDI) modelling for rucaparib was performed using in vitro 
parameters and the mean steady state Cmax of rucaparib (6.0 μM) following 600 mg rucaparib twice daily (BID). 
Concomitant usage of strong P-gp, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6 inhibitors did not appear to impact rucaparib PK.  
During treatment with 600 mg rucaparib BID, patients who had concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) showed slightly higher (approximately 15% higher F1), but largely overlapping, exposures as compared 
with the other patients; the effect was deemed clinically insignificant.  
Insufficient data were available for other classes of concomitant drugs, including strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers, and strong BCRP inhibitors.  
In vivo:  
No formal in vivo drug interactions with rucaparib as a victim were conducted. 
Effects of rucaparib on other medicinal products  
In vitro: 
In vitro, rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, 
CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human 
hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib is an inhibitor of multidrug and toxin extrusion 
transporter (MATE) 1 and MATE2-K, OCT1 and OCT2. Weak inhibition was observed at 300 μM for multidrug 
resistance associated protein MRP (4), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OAT3. That concentration is considered 
supra-therapeutic for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3, but not for MRP4. Thus, inhibition of MRP4 in vivo 
in the gut cannot be ruled out. Rucaparib did not interact with MRP2, MRP3 or bile salt export pump (BSEP) at 
rucaparib concentrations up to 300 μM. That concentration is considered supra -therapeutic  concentration for 
BSEP, but not for MRP2 and MRP3. For MRP2 and MRP3 this concentration is lower than the Cmax reached in the 
gut of patients. Therefore, as requested, an additional in vitro study  was performed to evaluate the potential of 
rucaparib to inhibit MRP2 and MRP3 at higher rucaparib concentrations. This study showed mild bi-phasic 
activation and inhibition of MRP2 and concentration dependent inhibition of MRP3. The clinical relevance MRP2 
and MRP3 interaction in the gut is not known. In vitro, rucaparib is an inhibitor of the BCRP and P-gp efflux 
transporters with IC50 values suggesting a potential for P-gp and BCRP inhibition in the gut and potential for 
BCRP inhibition also in the liver and renal. 
In silico - Mechanistic static modelling: 
The DDI potential of rucaparib through CYP interaction was assessed by calculating the ratio of AUC (AUCR) of 
CYP probe drugs in the presence and absence of rucaparib coadministration at target clinical exposures using 
mechanistic static modelling. Hepatic CYP interaction with CYP probe drugs was modelled except for CYP3A4, 
where reversible inhibition in both the liver and the gut were considered using midazolam as the probe, and for 
CYP1A2, where a net effect based on both reversible inhibition and induction by rucaparib was modelled. 
According to the classification of in vivo inhibitors of CYP enzymes, the DDI potential for rucaparib was moderate 
for CYP3A (AUCR = 5.0), CYP1A2 (AUCR = 2.9), CYP2C8 (AUCR = 2.6), and CYP2D6 (AUCR = 2.3); but 
appeared to be strong (AUCR > 5) for CYP2C19 (AUCR = 11) and CYP2C9 (AUCR = 5.2). Given that CYP3A 
down-regulation was not considered in the current modelling, AUCR for CYP3A could further increase.

In vivo: 
Based on the in vitro results, the effects of rucaparib coadministration on the PK of sensitive substrates of 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, and P-gp has been assessed in the ongoing cocktail-based drug-drug 
interaction study in patients (Study CO-338-044). The PK of CYP cocktail probes (caffeine [CYP1A2], S-warfarin 
[CYP2C9], omeprazole [CYP2C19]), and midazolam [CYP3A4]) and a P-gp probe (digoxin) were assessed with 
and without rucaparib treatment. Patients received single doses of CYP drug cocktail (caffeine, warfarin, 
omeprazole, and midazolam) on Day 1 and Day 12, and single doses of digoxin on Day 2 and Day 13. Continuous 
treatment with rucaparib 600 mg BID started on Day 5 and lasted until at least Day 16 of Part I. PK samples of 
the CYP probes were collected up to 96 hr for the CYP probes and digoxin. Vitamin K was given with warfarin on 
Days 1 and 12, and if clinically necessary, on Days 2 and 13 to mitigate bleeding risk. The patients were 
genotyped for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Based on the genotyping results poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 (n = 2) were 
excluded from the S-warfarin DDI assessment. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Presented above in various sections (mainly as “in vitro”). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rucaparib (CO-338) is a potent, oral small molecule inhibitor of PARP enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2 and 
PARP-3. The putative rucaparib metabolites M324 and M338 were synthesized, and preliminary in vitro 
characterization was performed. Data suggest that metabolites M324 and M338 have limited enzymatic and 
cellular activity against PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Dose justification 
Rucaparib doses up to 840 mg BID were tested during the dose-escalation phase in Study CO-338-010, but the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The justification for the recommended rucaparib dose of 600 
mg BID with or without food is based on the cumulative safety and efficacy evaluations in ovarian cancer 
patients at the proposed dosage. Selection of 600 mg rucaparib, instead of a lower starting dose, is supported 
by the exposure-efficacy analysis with higher IRR assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) response rate at higher exposures. 
QT prolongation 
The effects of oral rucaparib on QTc prolongation were evaluated in Study CO-338-010 Part 1. ECG data (pre 
–dose and at 2 and 7 hours post- dose) were centrally read by Cardiocore. The ECG study population comprised 
56 patients. The primary endpoint for analyses of QTc was change from baseline (Day -1 prior to Cycle 1) in 
QTcF (ΔQTcF). The mean values for change of QTcF in Cycle 1 ranged from 5.0 to 14.0 ms. Of the 56 patients 
enrolled, there were baseline and post-dose ECG measurements for 55 patients. Of these, 6 (11%) patients had 
at least one post baseline QTcF measurement >450ms and 10 (18%) had increase in QTcF >30ms from

baseline. One patient receiving 480 mg BID rucaparib had a QTcF ≥ 480 msec and it was determined that this 
patient was receiving citalopram, a medication with known potential to cause QT prolongation that was not 
prohibited per protocol. This patient continued to receive monotherapy rucaparib at a dose of 480 mg BID with 
no further QTcF measurement ≥ 480 msec. One patient of 56 had a QTcF increase from baseline > 60 msec and 
it was subsequently determined that this patient had a history of QT prolongation prior to study entry and 
received 1 dose of rucaparib before discontinuing from the study due to eligibility violation.

It seems that there is an increasing rucaparib concentration associated with increasing QTcF from baseline. 
Additionally, an exposure-QTc analysis has been conducted. The projected drug-related median QTcF 
prolongation from baseline following 600 mg rucaparib BID was 11.5 msec (90% CI of 8.77 to 14.2 msec), with 
the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval of 17.2 msec (90% CI of 12.6 msec to 21.7 msec).

Companion Diagnostic 
Clovis has collaborated with Foundation Medicine, Inc (FMI) to develop a Companion Diagnostic (CDx) test. 
Central testing in the clinical studies was initially performed using the clinical trial assay (CTA) and subsequently 
bridged to the CDx. Tumour specimens from 79 patients in the primary efficacy (PE) population were received 
for central BRCA mutation testing at FMI; there was a high positive agreement between local and central BRCA 
results. The CTA and CDx results appeared consistent. The CDx test does not distinguish between germline and 
somatic BRCA mutations. The FoundationFocus™ CDxBRCA test was CE marked on 19 January 2017. The 
FoundationOne® test will be made available in each member state in the EU. 
Exposure-Response analyses 
Steady-state average PK parameters (AUCavg,ss, Cminss,avg, Cmax,avg,ss) were utilized for exposure-response 
analysis. For efficacy analysis, the primary variable was AUCavg,ss, and Cmin,ss,avg was explored in a sensitivity 
analysis. For safety analysis, the primary variable was Cmax,avg,ss, although AUCavg,ss was also explored in the 
sensitivity analysis. The additional exposure-efficacy analyses tested four endpoints: investigator assessed 
confirmed response according to RECIST v1.1, independent radiology review (IRR) assessed confirmed 
response according to RECIST v1.1, maximum percent change from baseline in sum of diameters of tumour 
target lesions (per RECIST v1.1) from the investigator assessed dataset, and maximum percent change from 
baseline in serum cancer antigen-125 (CA-125). Investigator and IRR confirmed response, and the best change 
from baseline in sum of diameters of target lesions were analysed only in the efficacy subset of patients with 
measurable disease (measurable tumour at baseline). The maximum percent change from baseline in sum of 
diameters of tumour target lesions is derived from investigator assessments. 
The efficacy dataset (N=121) comprised ovarian cancer patients with a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
with at least two prior chemotherapies who received at least 1 dose of rucaparib (40-1680 mg/day). It did not 
cover a large range of doses with the majority of patients (n=110) receiving 600 mg BID. AUCavg,ss was selected 
as the exposure metric based on the population PK model and actual doses for each patients.  
Investigator-confirmed RECIST Version 1.1 response rate (n = 118, p = 0.201) and the RECIST/CA-125 
composite response rate (n = 118, p = 0.137) did not significantly increase with increasing daily dose. No 
statistically significant relationship was observed between AUCss,avg and investigator-confirmed RECIST Version 
1.1 response rate (n = 114, p = 0.169), maximum change from baseline in SDTL (n = 114, p = 0.136) or 
RECIST/CA-125 response rate (n = 114, p = 0.396). The response vs. AUCss,avg regression lines suggested 
similar responses over the tested dose range and over the 90% confidence interval of AUCss,avg with a starting 
hr/mL). Therefore, clinically observed PK variability is not expected to 
dose of 600 mg BID (20145 to 65136 ng
significantly impact clinical efficacy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by exposure quartile showed no 
⋅
consistent improvement in PFS or DOR with increasing rucaparib exposures.  
Longer PFIs correlated with better efficacy. Patients with PFI < 6 months had a RECIST Version 1.1 response 
rate of 20.7% compared with 74.2% in patients with PFI > 12 months. For PFS and DOR, compared to patients 
with a PFI of 6-12 months, patients with a PFI greater than 12 months had a relative risk of 0.42 and 0.45 
respectively and patients with a PFI < 6 months had a relative risk of 1.33 and 1.88 respectively, with confidence 
intervals that overlap 1. 
Similarly, in the second set of analyses, no significant exposure-efficacy correlation was observed for confirmed 
investigator-assessed objective response (n = 114, p = 0.738), maximum percent change from baseline in sum 
of diameters of target lesions (n = 112, p = 0.297) or maximum percent change from baseline in serum CA-125 
(n = 115, p = 0.705). Covariate analysis was also consistent with the first set of analysis. PFI was the only 
statistically significant covariate affecting independent radiology review (IRR) assessed RECIST response. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 57/167 
  
  
patients with PFI < 6 months, the observed IRR response rate was low [11% (3/27)], while the response rates 
in patients with PFI of 6-12 months and ≥ 12 months categories were similar and >50% (28/52 for 6 to 12 
months and 13/23 for ≥ 12 months). Higher exposure was associated with higher IRR (but not investigator) 
assessed RECIST response rate, and the correlation was statistically significant in patients with PFI ≥ 6 months 
(n = 75, p = 0.017).  
The small sample sizes in these analyses do not allow definitive conclusions. Further exposure efficacy analyses 
are warranted with emerging data from ongoing clinical studies. 
Exposure-Safety analyses 
In total, exposure-safety analysis was conducted with data from 393 ovarian cancer patients. Daily Cmax was 
selected as the exposure metric, and individual Cmax values were calculated from a population PK analysis. The 
exposure-safety analysis population included ovarian cancer patients who received at least one dose of 
rucaparib (N=375). The exposure-safety response modelling allows a reasonable understanding of the safety 
considerations with rucaparib dosing. From a safety viewpoint, changes in liver function, renal function, 
haematological parameters and asthenia/ fatigue correlated with rucaparib exposure. After accounting for 
covariates, Grade ≥ 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.033), Grade ≥ 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
(p = 0.027), Grade ≥3 platelet decrease (p=0.04), maximum haemoglobin change-from-baseline (p<0.001), 
Grade ≥2 increased creatinine (p<0.001) and Grade ≥3 fatigue/asthenia (p=0.029) had a statistically 
significant exposure-response relationship. At the median Cmax following 600 mg rucaparib BID (1774 ng/mL), 
the mean haemoglobin decrease was 2.5 g/dL with 5th to 95th percentile confidence intervals of 2.2 to 2.6 g/dL. 
Following 600 mg rucaparib BID, the model-projected incidences were 30.1% for Grade ≥2 creatinine, 13.8% 
for Grade ≥3 ALT, 4.4% for Grade ≥3 AST, 6.3% for Grade ≥3 platelets, and 11.7% for Grade ≥3 
fatigue/asthenia. The effect on creatinine is due to inhibition of MATE 1 and 2k without a change in GFR. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A mass balance study (CO-338-045) is ongoing. This study will further elucidate distribution, mean pathways of 
metabolism, routes of elimination and potential interactions of rucaparib and its metabolites. This data will also 
allow to confirm the mean absolute oral bioavailability at the 600 mg dose and to clarify the reasons of low 
bioavailability. The applicant is recommended to submit the results. 
Additionally, a dedicated hepatic impairment study in patients with advanced cancer (CO-338-078) is ongoing, 
which is required for further investigating the impact of moderate hepatic impairment on rucaparib (considered 
as missing information). Patients with normal hepatic function and moderate hepatic impairment will be 
included. The Part I CSR of Study CO-338-078 is estimated to be available in Q3 2019. (See RMP) 
Solubility of rucaparib is low (1.4 mg active/mL in water at 25°C, 1.7 mg active/mL in water at 37°C). It is 
expected that 600 mg of rucaparib will be administered with 250 ml of water (2.4 mg/ml). Rucaparib showed a 
lower solubility at pH of 1 and 2, which suggests a potential impact of food and PPIs effects on PK of rucaparib 
(see SmPC 4.5). 
Rucaparib showed moderate/low permeability across a Caco-2 monolayer. Rucaparib showed higher 
permeability in the B-A direction than in the A-B direction, with ER values evaluated >2, indicating that there 
was active efflux of this compound in Caco-2 cell at all investigated concentrations. Ka reflects the coefficient for 
the total rucaparib amount at the absorption site that transited by a zero-order release kinetics, from the 
administration compartment. Therefore, due to rucaparib shows a low solubility, Ka would be reduced at higher 
doses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 58/167 
  
  
Absorption 
The Applicant described different modelling approaches to characterize the delayed onset of absorption of 
rucaparib PK observations. Different models were adopted but all accounted for a delay in the absorption as a 
consequence of drug disintegration, dissolution, gastric emptying, etc but none of them considered the likely 
process of precipitation. The Applicant is recommended to provide clear evidence of other absorption models 
that might reduce IIV on absorption parameters (ka and D1) and better explain the food effect on dose and 
bioavailability, which could be related to the modest in vitro solubility of rucaparib. Other structural models, 
incorporating mechanistic absorption processes are recommended to be submitted in a proper population PK 
report. 
Dose has been selected as a significant covariate on ka parameter, decreasing the ka value as dose increases. 
The influence of dose on any PK parameter is purely empirical and is related to non-linear processes. In the 
intestinal wall, different transporters are involved in the uptake or efflux of xenobiotics. 
Bioavailability 
The mean absolute oral bioavailability provided on report is based on much lower doses (≤120 mg) than the one 
recommended. Considering that dose seems to have impact on Ka and that there are differences between food 
effect on lower and higher dose than 480 mg, results from the ongoing mass-balance study, which is 
recommended, are awaited in order to confirm the absolute oral bioavailability at the 600 mg dose and to clarify 
the reasons of low bioavailability.  
Bioequivalence 
Different strength and formulations have been used in the pivotal clinical studies. The compositions of strengths 
with the same formulation are considered proportional. Additionally, these tablets achieved greater than 85% 
dissolution within 15 minutes. Therefore, bioequivalence study is not considered necessary between doses with 
the same formulation.  
Although a tablet of 250 mg - formulation E has not been used in any clinical study, no further studies are 
considered necessary because its composition is considered proportional to tablets of 200 mg and 300 mg, 
formulation E and they achieved greater than 95% dissolution within 15 minutes.  
Influence of food 
The effect of food on bioavailability of rucaparib appears complicated. 
Food intake would enhance the drug absorption as the absorption of rucaparib is incomplete and deemed to be 
driven by its solubility. However, in the population PK analysis there is an increase in the ka value in fasted 
conditions (0.1 h-1) compared to patient-selected and high-fat meal (0.072 h-1). 
There is an absolute increase (14.5%) on the bioavailability in patient-receiving high-fat meal (dose greater 
than 480 mg) group vs patient of choice group. However, there is an opposite effect (decrease of 8.2%) on 
bioavailability in patients receiving high-fat meals (dose lower than 480 mg) group vs patient of choice group. 
The influence of high-fat meal was not adequately addressed, considering that high-fat meal increases oral 
bioavailability at 600 mg (51.7% vs 37.2%), whereas decreases at dose levels below 480 mg (29%). It leads to 
almost 59% higher exposures in the high-fat meal group vs. the others (patient-selected and fasted). It should 
be noted that with these results rucaparib apparently showed non-linear pharmacokinetics under high-fat meal 
conditions, which could have an impact on dose adjustments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 59/167 
  
  
There was limited meal information collected in order to establish any relationship between food and incidence 
of nausea/vomiting. 
Variability seems very similar between high-fat meal and fasted groups, indicating a lack of relationship that 
would require any food recommendation. However, the IIV on PK of the patient-selected group is missing. The 
applicant is recommended to further evaluate additional population PK models in order to explain any 
dose-dependent food effect. 
Metabolism 
The main metabolites, carboxylic acid (M324) and a Phase 2 N-methylated metabolite of M324 (M338) have 
been preliminary identified. Pharmacokinetics of the main metabolites were not described by the Applicant. 
Results from the mass balance study are awaited. The mass-balance study should allow to identify the 
contribution of the metabolites in the PK of rucaparib. The applicant is encouraged to monitor M324 and M338 
metabolites plasma levels in patients after repeated administration and assess if potential for accumulation of 
these metabolites could be excluded. Considering the relative abundance of metabolites M324 and M338, they 
should be properly characterised (pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, interactions). Characterisation of M324 
and M338 should be performed based on the results of the studies CO-338-045 (mass-balance) and 
CO-338-078 (hepatic patients). This information is recommended to be provided as soon as the results of these 
studies become available. 
Genetic polymorphism 
Enzymes responsible for rucaparib metabolism have not been identified. Based on in vitro data, CYP2D6, and to 
a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, were able to metabolize rucaparib. In population PK analysis, patients with 
different CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 genotypes showed comparable rucaparib PK. However, impact of genotypes on 
pharmacokinetic cannot be fully ruled out based only on population PK analysis. It should be noted that several 
relevant subgroups of phenotypes have limited representation, especially for CYP2D6. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Rucaparib appears to be almost proportional to the dose in the range of 40 to 500 mg QD and 240 to 840 mg 
BID, which includes the recommended dose (600 mg BID).  
In population PK model, dose has been selected as a significant covariate on Ka parameter, this fact suggests 
non-linear pharmacokinetics. However, probably due to long T1/2, no-linearity on Ka is not reflected in exposure. 
Data provided do not allow comparison of different structural PK parameters (Ka, CL, V1, etc) across time. 
However, the observed trough PK data do not show time-dependent PK and model evaluation through 
prediction-corrected visual predictive check from Part 1 (Day 1 and 15) and Part 3 (Day 1 and 15) showed the 
adequacy of the model to describe the experimental data for each food group of patients, assuming 
time-independent parameters. As consequence, clinically significant auto-inhibition or auto-induction related to 
CYP2D6, CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 seem to be unlikely. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The model selected for inter-individual variability in the population PK model seems acceptable. The estimated 
variability in the absorption parameters (Ka and D1) appears to be high. After the inclusion of significant 
covariates, the inter-individual variability did not decrease in a significant manner. Table 9 (model parameter 
estimates for the final PPK model) does not report the RSE (relative standard error) of the inter-individual 
variability obtained with the bootstrap analysis. Instead, 95% CIs were reported for the bootstrap estimates of 
the inter-individual variability to assess the precision of the parameter estimation. The use of a proportional 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 60/167 
  
  
residual error model is adequate. The use of two additive components regarding the different sampling 
frequency is reasonable. However, 38% of residual error is extremely high, which can be related to a bias in the 
structural model selection (see comments on population PK model). 
Population PK model 
The population model development analysis is acceptable in terms of data handling, and missing data. However, 
several points need to be clarified:  
In the population pharmacokinetic model, the Ka generally decreased at higher dose levels. A zero-order release 
step was incorporated in the model to describe the delayed absorption. Sequentially, the absorption was 
described with the first-order kinetics where the rate of absorption is proportional to the amount of drug 
“released” by the zero-order step with Ka as the rate constant. Two distribution compartments were included 
assuming linear inter-compartment and elimination clearances.  
Other mechanistic models and the inclusion of a third distribution compartment will be assessed from available 
PK data from Study CO-338-014 that the applicant is recommended to submit. 
The effect of high fat meal would be related to a solubility-limited oral absorption of rucaparib. Rucaparib 
bioavailability is slightly increased in patients with no food restriction (37.2%) and greater increased in high-fat 
meal patients (51.7%) compared to fasted patients (32.6%), which represents for high-fat meal patients an 
increase of 58.6% in rucaparib bioavailability over fasted patients. However, the cumulative clinical PK, safety 
and efficacy data indicate that this effect is not clinically meaningful.   
The covariate analysis does not reduce the variability on the PK parameters. The clinical relevance of CLCr on CL 
was low at the extreme 10th and 90th percentiles (13% reduction and 13.3% increase, respectively). No clinical 
information was provided for the other covariates-parameter relationships.   
Taking into account the pharmacokinetics of Rubraca (partition coefficient blood-to-plasma approximately 2), its 
side effects (anaemia, reduction in haematocrit) and the cancer disease, red blood cell (RBC) and haematocrit 
(HCT) should be considered to be included in the PopPK model. The applicant explained that only data for HCT 
is available and showed that this does show a correlation with volume of distribution and clearance. However, 
the correlation with clearance is stated to be unexpected and it is suggested that it is due to a correlation of HCT 
with albumin and CrCL which are already included in the model. This is accepted. It is suggested that all the 
effects are not clinically significant but the lack of clinical significance of HCT on volume of distribution was not 
adequately discussed. A more adequate explanation about the lack of clinical significance of HCT on volume of 
distribution and Cmax was provided in the following round of responses. The applicant suggests that the testing 
of HCT as a time varying covariate is more robust, this is agreed and a large effect is not expected at steady 
state. 
The following comments should be also noted: 
-Final goodness-of-fit plots show an underprediction of the model at higher concentrations, which is related to 
a model misspecification on the Cmax. This could reflect an inadequate absorption model that requires further 
improvement. 
-The large variability that it is associated to the absorption parameters did not decrease after the inclusion of 
Dose and Food as covariates. Moreover, the use of dose as covariate reflects non-linear absorption process, 
which has not been explored during model development process. 
Special populations

Regarding special populations analysis, no formal investigations have been performed in renal and hepatic 
impaired patients so far. A dedicated study, which is required for further investigating the impact of moderate 
hepatic impairment on rucaparib (considered as missing information), including patients with advanced cancer 
and normal hepatic function or moderate hepatic impairment (CO-338-078) is planned (see RMP). According to 
the provided protocol, Cmax and AUC will be the primary PK parameters in this study; however T1/2, which is a 
secondary parameter, could also be important to inform dose frequency. On the other hand, no reliable 
information could be derived from the population-PK analysis since very limited data collected in moderate/mild 
insufficient patients were part of the analysed dataset. Considering that the mass-balance study is still ongoing, 
the results are still preliminary. The PK assessment on these population groups has not been properly assessed 
and any dose recommendation is accepted based on available data but is still provisional.  
The relationship between age, BMI and weight, and these exposure metrics were evaluated. Neither baseline 
BMI nor body weight showed relationships with observed or model-predicted exposure metrics, including AUCss 
and Cmax,ss. 
Results from elderly +85 should be considered with caution as only one patient was enrolled in Studies 
CO-338-010 and CO-338-017. 
Current smokers had 22.8-29.9% lower PK exposures compared to non-smokers. This covariate effect was 
properly assessed covariate searching, but no statistically significant results were obtained in order to 
incorporate smoking status into the model, due to this effect is partially explained by the inclusion of CLCr 
covariate on CL. Higher CLCr values were correlated to current smokers, decreasing in the former smokers and 
non-smokers groups. This fact could be relation with CYP1A2 as enzyme responsible for rucaparib metabolism. 
It should be noted that smoking is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme activity. The number of current smoker 
is limited (n=16). Therefore, the clinical relevance of CYP1A2 as enzyme responsible for rucaparib metabolism 
cannot be fully ruled out. 
Due to the unbalanced Asian and Black proportion of patients, no conclusion could be made regarding the 
influence of race on rucaparib PK’s. 
Around 10 cases of AML/MDS (myelodysplasia) was reported out of 1077 treated with Rubraca. Therefore, 
AML/MDS are considered as adverse events of special interest (AESIs). A summary of the PK data in AML/MDS 
patients comparing to non-AML/MDS patients and an analysis in the PopPK model showed that the exposure is 
broadly similar. 
The expected changes in albumin by renal and hepatic function and that of the albumin effect in the PopPK 
model are small and in the reverse direction to that that would be expected. In addition, it is noted that the ppb 
of Rubraca is relatively low so unlikely to change significantly with changes in albumin.

Interactions: 
Effects of other medicinal products on rucaparib (as a victim drug) 
The effects in vivo of other medicinal products on rucaparib have been only investigated on the population PK. 
Results of the population PK should be considered as exploratory because dose administered and time of 
exposure of the concomitant drug is unknown.  
In vitro data suggested slow metabolism by CYP enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism of rucaparib. Rucaparib was shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. 
If results of Study CO-338-045 (mass balance) support the in vitro results, the effects of strong inhibitors of 
CYP2D6, P-gp and BCRP on rucaparib pharmacokinetic would have to be investigated in dedicated in vivo 
drug-drug interaction studies. Additionally, the effects of strong inhibitors and strong inducers of CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 on rucaparib pharmacokinetic could have to be investigated in dedicated in vivo drug-drug interaction 
studies. It should be noted that the number of active smokers (n=16) and poor CYP2D6 (n=10) in the dataset 
included in the population PK is limited. 
With the available data, a significant contribution of CYP3A4 cannot be excluded. CYP3A4 was less important in 
vitro, but the relative/quantitative contribution of different CYPs in vivo cannot be determined from in vitro data. 
CYP3A4 is highly abundant in vivo, and could contribute to a high degree of first-pass metabolism. The MAH 
states that no restrictions on inhibitors/inducers of CYPs or other enzymes are required in ongoing clinical 
rucaparib safety/efficacy studies. However, according to the study report for study CO-338-017, concomitant 
use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A2 or 3A4 was excluded in this study. In the dose-escalation study 
CO-338-010, inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2 or 3A4 were to be avoided. Therefore, from the safety data 
currently available, it appears that no conclusions on the safety of concomitant use of strong CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 
inhibitors can be drawn. 
As CYP3A4 inhibition or induction can lead to very large effects on exposure of a CYP3A4 substrate, e.g. if there 
is a large degree of first-pass metabolism, a warning against use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers has 
been included in the SmPC, awaiting data from the mass-balance study and, if necessary, further DDI studies. 
(CYP1A2 inhibition may be of less concern as the effects are seldom as large as what can be observed with 
CYP3A4 inhibition). 
Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the population PK analysis about PPIs because dose given and time of 
administration has not been documented for PPIs. However, the risk for a clinically relevant effect of PPIs is 
likely small. The anticipated effect would be an increase in exposure. However, rucaparib could be administered 
with food in the efficacy/safety studies, and it is considered unlikely that a PPI would induce a larger increase in 
exposure than that seen with a high-fat meal.  
Effects of rucaparib on other medicinal products pharmacokinetic (as a perpetrator drug) 
The effects of rucaparib coadministration on the PK of sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP3A, and P-gp was assessed in the cocktail-based drug-drug interaction study in patients (Study 
CO-338-044). The Applicant has provided the results from Study CO-338-044 Part 1, where rucaparib showed 
moderate inhibition of CYP1A2, weak inhibition of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, and marginal inhibition of 
P-gp. 
It should be noted that rucaparib is an inhibitor of the P-gp efflux transporters with IC50 values suggesting a 
potential for P-gp inhibition in the gut. However, the study has been conducted with digoxin instead of 
dabigatran etexilate, which seems to be more sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition than oral digoxin. Therefore, 
results with digoxin could be underestimating the effect on P-gp in the gut. Results by genotypes for CYP1A2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 63/167 
  
  
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 have not been provided yet. For time-dependent interaction (CYP3A down-regulation), 
the maximum effect is expected when a new steady state level of the affected enzyme has been obtained. To 
better estimate the % steady state of potential CYP3A4 regulation achieved following 7 days rucaparib 
treatment, an indirect effect pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model was developed. Based on this model, 
the study cannot be considered at steady state for cytochrome effects as the Kdeg is quite high (Kdeg = 0.00962 
hr-1 in liver) and even with this value the calculation is only 80% for hepatic CYP3A4, therefore perhaps the 
effects seen are not maximal. The applicant has provided an updated assessment of CYP3A4 downregulation 
using a mechanistic model, where oral and intravenous route of administration have been discussed separately. 
Using different conservative approaches, it seems that the magnitude of the effect is still between the range 
≥1.25 but <2 fold, which suggest that the effect would be weak in all tested scenarios. Therefore, although 
perhaps the effects seen are not maximal, this issue is not further pursued. 
If a metabolite is responsible for the enzyme inhibition, steady state of the metabolite should have been 
reached. However, the mean metabolites have not been fully characterized. When characterization of 
metabolites is available their impact on this DDI study should be discussed and the results of this DDI study 
could be re-assessed. 
A justification that probe drugs combined in the cocktail do not interact in vivo with other was provided and 
considered acceptable. The Cooperstown 5+1 cocktail has been validated. Study CO-338-044 used a modified 
cocktail that included 4 of the 5 cocktail probes. Digoxin is not part of the validated cocktail, and was thus dosed 
separately. Taking into account the T1/2 of caffeine (1 – 4 hours), warfarin (31-40 hours), omeprazole (1 hour) 
and midazolam (1.5-2.5 hours), only warfarin would not be eliminated when digoxin is administered. However, 
taking into account the metabolism and route of elimination/excretion of warfarin and digoxin no interaction is 
expected between them. 
The applicant was requested to discuss plans to further investigate in dedicated in vivo drug-drug interaction 
studies inhibition of UGT 1A1, CYP 2D6, BCRP, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2k (with e.g. with metformin, 
dofetilide) and induction of CYP 2B6,CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. This issue was discussed for: 
UGT1A1 inhibition: 
Considering that available data suggests rucaparib has a limited potential to cause clinically meaningful UGT1A1 
inhibition together with the fact that a UGT1A1 probe for DDI studies is not clearly identified and rucaparib 
cannot be administered to healthy volunteers, the applicant’s justification for not conducting a clinical study to 
evaluate UGT1A1 inhibition by rucaparib is acceptable. A statement is included in the SmPC to reflect that 
special caution should be paid when it is co-administered with UGT1A1 substrates (i.e. irinotecan) to in patients 
with UGT1A1*28 (poor metabolizer).  
CYP2D6 and CYP2C8 inhibition: 
As rucaparib, in vivo, showed moderate or weak inhibition of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) 
which were higher reversibly inhibited by rucaparib in vitro than CYP2D6 and CYP2C8, the in vitro weak CYP2D6 
and CYP2C8 inhibition by rucaparib, is unlikely to result in clinically significant drug-drug interactions in vivo. 
Considering that rucaparib cannot be administered to healthy volunteers, the applicant’s justification for not 
conducting a dedicated DDI study is accepted, although it should be noted that CYP1A2 with AUCR=2.9 in the 
mechanistic static modelling (the third lowest AUCR after CYP2C8, AUCR=2.6 and CYP2D6, AUCR =2.3) showed 
the higher inhibition in vivo study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 64/167 
  
  
 
 
BCRP: 
The proposed text included in Section 4.5 of the SmPC is acceptable. However, further assessment of the in vivo 
BCRP inhibition by rucaparib is recommended (see RMP). It should be noted that in vitro, IC50 for BCRP (55 μM) 
is lower than for P-gp (169 μM). These IC50 suggested a potential inhibition for P-gp and BCRP in gut but also 
for BCRP in liver and kidneys. Data of in vivo study with P-gp substrate (rucaparib marginally inhibits P-gp in the 
gut) cannot be considered a worst scenario for efflux transporters in the gut because the IC50 is lower for BCRP 
and the DDI study of P-gp has been conducted with digoxin instead with dabigatran etexilate. Additionally, 
rucaparib can inhibit BCRP in liver and kidneys. It should be also pointed out that an interaction with statin drugs 
(competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase) as BCRP substrate drugs has high clinical relevance. Therefore, 
an additional study to assess in vivo BCRP inhibition by rucaparib will be conducted. (See RMP) 
OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K: 
Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE 1 and MATE2-K, and a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, and OCT2. The rapid 
increase in serum creatinine following the start of rucaparib treatment in patients, indicates that rucaparib is an 
inhibitor of renal transporters in vivo, and is likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicines which are actively 
excreted in the urine. Thus, irrespective if rucaparib is transported for more than 25% in urine, a in vivo 
interaction study would be recommended in this case (e.g. with metformin, dofetilide) to estimate the effect size 
of the interaction. However, as DDI studies will need to be carried out in cancer patients, an effect can already 
be expected based on the creatinine elevations observed with rucaparib treatment and the number of known 
substrates for which clinically relevant changes can be expected is low, this issue has been considered as 
resolved listing these substrates as examples (i.e. metformin) in a specific warning in the SmPC.  
Induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4: 
The potential in vivo dual effect on CYP1A2 (reversible inhibition and induction) and CYP3A4 (reversible 
inhibition and down regulation) were investigated in clinical study CO-338-044. As rucaparib did not inhibit 
CYP2B6 and the CYP2B6 down regulation by rucaparib was less than for CYP3A4, the potential for clinically 
meaningful DDI with rucaparib as a CYP2B6 perpetrator is unlikely. Therefore, no evaluation in vivo of the effect 
of rucaparib on CYP2B6 is considered acceptable. 
Considering that rucaparib is a potential human teratogen and might be used in a population including fertile 
women, a DDI study with an oral contraceptive steroid is planned (see RMP). The results from Study 
CO-338-044 suggest that steady state rucaparib is likely to have a limited impact on the exposure of oral 
contraceptives. In addition, because rucaparib inhibits CYP3A, the interaction would not be expected to result in 
decreased exposures, and thus reduced efficacy, of oral contraceptives. However, as the Guideline on the 
investigation of drug interaction (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) mentions, there may still be mechanisms 
of induction which presently are unknown. Therefore, a potential human teratogen (Definition given in 
EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005) needs to be studied in vivo for effects on contraceptive steroids if the drug is 
intended for use in fertile women, regardless of the in vitro induction study results. Consequently, although 
justification for rucaparib as a CYP3A perpetrator is reasonable, an in vivo study will be conducted since there 
may still be mechanisms of induction which presently are unknown. This is also reflected in the SmPC. 
Dose justification 
Dose justification has been properly assessed in the Efficacy section. Dose adjustments under section 4.2 in the 
SmPC are based on the rucaparib clinical experience. With available data, the proposed dose adjustments seem 
to be appropriated to manage the AEs. The applicant is encouraged to collect further data from clinical 
experience to review and improve the proposed dose adjustment in the future.

Secondary pharmacology – QT prolongation 
A relationship between QTcF and rucaparib exposure at 600 mg BID was shown. The projected drug-related 
median QTcF prolongation from baseline following 600 mg rucaparib BID was 11.5 msec (90% CI of 8.77 to 14.2 
msec), with the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval of 17.2 msec (90% CI of 12.6 msec to 
21.7 msec). Consequently, the concentration-response analysis showed an upper bound of the two-side 90% CI 
for the QTc effect > 10 ms at the highest clinically relevant exposure with a mean prolongation <20 ms.  
 There were 5 cases of cardiac or related events potentially associated with QT prolongation (1 patient with SAE 
of grade 4 arrhythmia secondary to congenital QTC syndrome, 2 patients with SAE of cardiac arrest, and 2 
patients with SAE of syncope) were identified in patients (n = 1077) that have been exposed to oral rucaparib 
in Clovis-sponsored studies as of 10 April 2017. A review of the 5 cases from the search indicated other 
possible/likely causality for each specific reported event, including pre-existing cardiac history in 2 of the 
patients. Additionally, a total of 3 events of seizure have been reported in the 1077 patients exposed to 
rucaparib in Clovis-sponsored studies as of 10 April 2017, although none of them were attributed to potential 
cardiac abnormalities, and there was no documented evidence of arrhythmia. 
For all above, the potential effect on cardiac repolarization has been established as low for the moment. QT 
prolongation has been included as an Important Potential Risk in the RMP, along with details on monitoring 
events of QT prolongation, their subsequent review and management. Additionally, information on potential 
effect on cardiac repolarization has been reflected in the SmPC and RMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology has been characterized overall. However, several relevant issues should be addressed. 
Results of the Study CO-338-045 (mass balance), which is a recommended study, will be submitted in order to 
elucidate distribution, the main metabolism pathways and routes of excretion/elimination. Additionally, main 
metabolites should be properly characterized with results from the recommended study, Study CO-338-045 
(mass balance) and Study CO-338-078 (hepatic impairment) in the RMP. Without this data, it is difficult to 
properly assess interactions. For the moment, interactions can be considered properly discussed and justified 
according to the available data. Further DDI studies with substrates of BCRP and contraceptives will be 
conducted (see RMP). Additional studies could be required when further data on metabolism pathways and 
metabolites profile are available. 
The study CO-338-078 in patients with hepatic impairment is part of the RMP and a report on other structural 
models of population pharmacokinetics is recommended to be submitted. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy data came from a group of patients enrolled in two Phase 2 open-label studies that evaluated 
rucaparib as open-label treatment for relapsed ovarian cancer. The primary efficacy population comprises 106 
ovarian cancer patients harbouring a deleterious BRCA mutation who received 2 or more prior regimens of 
chemotherapy.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study CO-338-010: A Phase I/II open-label, safety, PK and preliminary efficacy study of oral 
rucaparib in patients with gBRCA mutation ovarian cancer or other solid tumours. 
Study CO-338-010 is an ongoing 3-part, multi-centre, multi-national, Phase 1/2, open-label, safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy study of oral rucaparib administered daily for continuous 21-day cycles. 
Patients enrolled in to one specific part of the study only. There were no control groups. Rucaparib tablets 
(40mg, 60mg, 120mg, 200mg or 300mg) were taken without reference to food intake, except Day -7 and Day 
1 of the food effect portion of the study. A new treatment cycle could begin if ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L, platelet count 
≥75.0 x 109/L and non-haematologic toxicities returned to baseline or ≤ Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 severity (or ≤CTCAE Grade 2 severity at the investigator’ s discretion). 
From the 3 parts of the study (1, 2A and 2B and 3), Part 1 served as the basis for dose finding. 
Part 1 evaluated the safety and PK of escalating doses of rucaparib and determined the MTD and RP2D in 
patients with advanced solid tumours. There was a RP2D expansion cohort in patients with a deleterious gBRCA 
mutation by local BRCA testing of DNA extracted from blood or buccal samples. No dose reductions were 
permitted in Cycle 1. 
Part 2A evaluated the overall investigator-assessed response rate (ORR) of rucaparib by RECIST Version 1.1 in 
patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer who had 
received between 2 and 4 prior treatment regimens, with a maximum of 1 non-platinum regimen. Patients had 
to harbour a deleterious gBRCA mutation as determined by a local laboratory test. Archival formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples were retrospectively requested to confirm the presence of BRCA 
mutations utilizing the FMI validated tests (CTA then CDx). 
Part 2B evaluated ORR of rucaparib by RECIST V1.1 in patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer with 
evidence of a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline or somatic) who received 3 to 4 prior chemotherapy 
regimens. Patients may have been sensitive, resistant or refractory to their most recent platinum regimen and 
have had a documented treatment – free interval (TFI) ≥6 months following the first chemotherapy regimen 
received. No patients had been enrolled in Part 2B as of the cut-off date (1 October 2015).   
Part 3 evaluated PK and safety at the RP2D of rucaparib in patients with any advanced solid tumour (including 
lymphoma), who had a known deleterious BRCA mutation (gBRCA or sBRCA) as determined by a local 
laboratory. There was no requirement for type or number of prior treatments received and patients could have 
received prior PARP inhibitor treatment, provided it was not the last treatment or received in the last 6 months. 
Efficacy data were immature at the time of the CSR and will be reported at study completion. 
Results 
Part 1: a total of 56 patients received at least 1 dose of rucaparib between December 2011 and October 2013. 
Dose escalations ranged from 40 to 500mg once daily followed by cohorts receiving 240 to 840mg BID for one 
or two 21-day cycles. All 56 patients have discontinued treatment, primarily due to PD by RECIST Version 1.1.

No patient at any QD dose level evaluated experienced a DLT. Only 1 DLT was observed (Grade 3 nausea in a 
patient at 360mg BID), so a MTD per protocol specified definition was not determined. Myelosuppression was 
observed in later cycles of treatment with rucaparib at higher BID dose levels. At the 600 mg BID dose level all 
3 patients initially treated achieved steady state levels at least 2 times the desired target Cmin of 2 μM (650 
ng/mL); there was no further increase in rucaparib trough level observed at the 840 mg BID dose. 
The DLT-evaluable population consisted of all patients who received at least 17 complete days of rucaparib and 
completed Cycle 1 of treatment or who experienced a DLT in Cycle 1 (N=49). No patient at any QD dose level 
evaluated experienced a DLT. Only 1 DLT was observed (Grade 3 nausea in a patient at 360mg BID), so a MTD 
per protocol specified definition was not determined. Myelosuppression was observed in later cycles of 
treatment with rucaparib at higher BID dose levels. At the 600 mg BID dose level all 3 patients initially treated 
achieved steady state levels at least 2 times the desired target Cmin of 2 μM (650ng/mL). No further increase in 
rucaparib trough level was observed at the 840 mg BID dose. 
A dose of 600mg BID was selected as the RP2D, as this was within the range of efficacious doses, within the 
approximate dose proportional linearity for rucaparib exposure at steady state and considered to be the highest 
dose with an acceptable safety profile for continuous administration. 
The efficacy-evaluable population consisted of all patients who met eligibility criteria, received at least 1 dose of 
rucaparib, had measurable tumour lesions at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline disease assessment 
(N=48). A confirmed response was recorded in 8 patients; 2 achieved a CR (both gBRCA1) and 6 achieved a PR 
(1 with gBRCA1, 3 with gBRCA2 and 2 with indeterminate germline/ somatic BRCA1). A best response of stable 
disease (SD) was recorded in 22 patients (11 with gBRCA 1 and 7 with gBRCA2). Data presented include 124 
patients enrolled in Part 1, Part 2A and Part 3 of the study. 
Part 2A: 42 platinum-sensitive patients were enrolled between February 2014 and April 2015; 36 patients 
discontinued treatment, mainly due to progressive disease (n=25). Two patients discontinued treatment due to 
an AE 4 and 10 days after initiating rucaparib; neither had a post-baseline disease assessment. ORR was 
evaluated in the efficacy evaluable population as the primary efficacy endpoint (n=40). Efficacy is presented in 
the safety population, consisting of patients who received at least 1 dose of rucaparib (n=42).

The ORR was broadly similar in patients with gBRCA1 (19/25, 65.5%, 95% CI 45.7-82.1%) and gBRCA2 (6/11, 
54.5%, 95% CI 23.4-83.3%) mutations. Most patients had a PFI of ≥6 to 12 months following their last dose of 
platinum (ORR 17/30, 56.7%, 95% CI 37.4-74.5%); the ORR appeared higher in patients with a PFI > 12 
months (8/10, 80%, 95% CI 44.4-97.5%). 
Duration of response was censored at the date of the last post-baseline scan for 8 patients. At the visit cut-off 
date, 5 responders (3 with CR & 2 with PR) were ongoing. The median duration of response in the 25 patients 
with a confirmed investigator- determined CR or PR was 270 days (95% CI 170-344 days) or approximately 8.9 
months (95% CI 5.6 -11.3 months) using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The median duration of response should 
be presented for all patients, not just those with a confirmed CR or PR, and those with no response assigned a 
duration of zero. 
Of the 40 efficacy-evaluable patients, 19 (47.5%) had a decrease of ≥50% in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions (SDTL). Over half of the responders (14/25, 56.0%) did so by week 8 (cycle 2); all 25 responded by week 
20 (cycle 6). 
Part 2B: Data were not presented for this part in the application as no patients had enrolled as of the 01 October 
2015 cut-off. 
Part 3: Characterisation of the PK, including the effect of food, of a higher dose strength (300 mg) rucaparib 
tablet in advanced solid tumour patients with a BRCA mutation. Efficacy data were immature at the time of the

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Clinical efficacy data come from a group of patients enrolled in two Phase 2 open-label studies that 
evaluated rucaparib as open-label treatment for relapsed ovarian cancer. The primary efficacy population 
Assessment report

comprises 106 ovarian cancer patients harbouring a deleterious BRCA mutation who received 2 or more prior 
regimens of chemotherapy.  
Table 8. Summary of Efficacy Data Cut-off Dates 
Study CO-338-010 is an ongoing 3-part, Phase 1/2, open-label, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy 
study of oral rucaparib administered daily for continuous 21-day cycles. Efficacy data are only provided from the 
part 2A, which enrolled patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive disease who received 2 to 4 prior treatment 
regimens and were known to harbour a gBRCA mutation based on results from local testing. Data are not 
included for patients in Part 2B as no patients were enrolled as of the enrolment cut-off date (1 October 2015)

CO-338-017 (ARIEL2) is an ongoing 2-part, Phase 2, open-label, efficacy study of oral rucaparib in patients 
with relapsed high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. 
All patients took 600 mg BID rucaparib with or without food in continuous 28-day treatment cycles. Patients 
continued to receive rucaparib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient or investigator request

2015, with relapsed, platinum-sensitive disease who had received ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and were 
known to have a BRCA mutation (germline or somatic).

Note: the ARIEL2 study schematic was taken on July 2015 
In addition, Clovis proposes to submit data from 2 additional studies post-approval, in order to support the 
conditional approval. Placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy data from a larger patient population within the 
same condition will be available first from Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3). Comparator-controlled data in the 
proposed treatment indication will be provided from Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) later. These data will likely 
form the basis of specific obligations that will further confirm a positive benefit:risk of rucaparib.  
•  Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3) is an ongoing randomized, international, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance treatment 
following response to platinum-based therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. The 
primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST Version 1.1, as assessed by the 
investigator. The target enrolment of 540 patients was completed in May 2016; data analyses were 
conducted in June2017. This study is considered to be supportive and potentially confirmatory to 
demonstrate clinical benefit of rucaparib for the following reasons: i) it is a randomized, 
placebo-controlled study where the benefit:risk profile of rucaparib can be assessed; ii) the study 
includes patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to platinum-based 
therapy; patients with a PR and residual disease may have further disease control or tumour reduction 
with rucaparib. Rucaparib as a maintenance treatment in these patients may therefore provide further 
evidence of safety and efficacy in an advanced disease setting. 
•  Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) is a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomized study evaluating 
Rucaparib versus chemotherapy for treatment of relapsed tBRCAmut (tumour tissue alteration in 
BRCA1/2, including gBRCA and sBRCA mutations) ovarian cancer. During the protocol assistance 
procedure concluded in February 2016, the CHMP agreed that Study CO-338-043 could serve as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 71/167 
  
  
 
 
confirmatory study to support conditional approval and provided initial comments on the study design 
based on information provided by Clovis within the meeting background materials. The study will enrol 
patients with relapsed, high grade epithelial serous or Grade 2 or Grade 3 endometrioid, ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer  who have a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in the tumour 
(tBRCAmut). All patients will be required to have received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. 
Study CO-338-043 enrolment (N=345) is anticipated to be complete in Q3 2020with interim data 
including the primary endpoint of PFS anticipated to be available by Q3 2021.

Patients with ovarian cancer who had received 2 to 4 prior treatment regimens and were known to harbour a 
deleterious gBRCA mutation. 
The deleterious gBRCA mutation was determined by a local laboratory test. No tumour tissue sample was 
required to have been submitted prior to enrolment or treatment with rucaparib. The applicant requested 
archival tumour samples to retrospectively confirm the BRCA mutation in tumour tissue using the proposed 
validated test (Foundation Medicine, Inc. [FMI] companion diagnostic test [CDx]. 
The last treatment received must have been a platinum-based regimen to which the patient must have been 
sensitive (ie, disease progression occurred at least 6 months after last dose of platinum was administered).

Study CO-338-017 
Inclusion criteria 
Part 1 enrols patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who had received at least 1 prior platinum-based regimen 
and had platinum-sensitive disease following their most recent platinum regimen, and Part 2 enrols patients who 
have received at least 3, and no more than 4, prior chemotherapy regimens bewho were resistant or refractory, 
as well as sensitive, to their last platinum-based regimen. Patients who were resistant or refractory to the last 
platinum-based regimen may also have received subsequent treatment with additional non-platinum based 
chemotherapy before initiating treatment with rucaparib. 
All patients in Part 1 were required to have undergone a biopsy of tumour tissue prior to enrolment and have the 
tumour tissue confirmed by central laboratory (FMI) as being of adequate quality. Submission of archival 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue was also required. For enrolment in Part 2, patients 
known to harbor a BRCA mutation were allowed to enrol without a biopsy provided that archival FFPE was 
available and was submitted to FMI for analysis. Based on the analysis of a screening biopsy and/or archival 
tumour tissue sample, patients were prospectively classified into 1 of 3 molecularly-defined HRD subgroups as 
defined by the clinical trial assay (CTA). The presence of a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in tumour 
tissue resulted in classification into the tBRCA mutation subgroup. Patients without a BRCA mutation were 
classified into 1 of 2 other subgroups based on the level of tumour genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
observed. These groups are referred to as non-BRCA/LOH+ and non-BRCA/LOH-. In Part 1, enrolment of 
patients known to harbour a deleterious gBRCA mutation was limited to 15 in order to ensure sufficient power for 
the comparison of the non-BRCA HRD subgroups. In other words, patients in this study can be classified as: 
BRCA: Patients whose tumour had a BRCA1/2 mutation, irrespective of genomic LOH measurement 
Non-BRCA LOH+: Patients whose tumour did not have a BRCA1/2 mutation and had a tumour genomic LOH 
measurement ≥ 14% (Part 1) or ≥ 18% (Part 2) 
Non-BRCA LOH-: Patients whose tumour did not have a BRCA1/2 mutation and had a tumour genomic LOH 
measurement < 14% (Part 1) or < 18% (Part 2) 
Unknown: Patients without a BRCA mutation and indeterminate for genomic LOH. 
However, and having said that, since the company is applying for an indication only in those patients with 
deleterious BRCA-mutated tumours, inclusive of both germline BRCA (gBRCA) and somatic BRCA (sBRCA) 
mutations, and who have been treated with 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy, the primary efficacy 
population will comprise 106 ovarian cancer patients harbouring a deleterious BRCA mutation who received 2 or 
more prior regimens of chemotherapy. 
Exclusion criteria 
•  Active second malignancy- history of malignancy permitted if all chemotherapy completed >6 months 
prior/ bone marrow transplant > 2 years prior to first dose

Treatments 
In study CO-338-010 part 2A patients received oral rucaparib 600 mg BID for 21-day cycles. Patients in Part 2A 
using 60 and 120 mg tablets had their dose of oral rucaparib modified as needed. 
In study CO-338-017 all patients received oral (PO) rucaparib at 600 mg BID in continuous 28-day cycles. 
Patients enrolled into Part 1 of the study initially received 60 mg or 120 mg tablets. Patients enrolled into Part 
2 of the study initially received 300 mg tablets. Tablets of 200 mg dose strength were also available for patients 
in Part 2 to enable dose reductions in 100 mg increments. 
Objectives 
Study CO-338-010 part 2A 
Main objective 
To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) in patients with relapsed, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer associated with a BRCA mutation 
Study CO-338-017 
Main objectives 
To determine FS in patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer classified into molecularly-defined 
subgroups by a prospectively defined HRD signature (Part 1) 
To estimate ORR in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed ovarian cancer classified into molecularly-defined 
subgroups by a prospectively defined HRD signature (Part 2) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Study CO-338-010 Part 2A 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Part 2A was ORR defined as best confirmed response according to RECIST 
Version 1.1. 
Study CO-338-017 
Part 1: The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS according to RECIST Version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, 
or death from any cause, in molecularly defined HRD subgroups. 
Part 2: The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR by RECIST Version 1.1 in molecularly defined HRD subgroups.

Sample size 
Study CO-338-010 Part 2A 
Up to 41 evaluable patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer associated with a gBRCA mutation were planned to be 
enrolled into Part 2A with an ORR of 20% set as the target.  
Study CO-338-017 
Part 1: It was anticipated that approximately 180 patients would be required in order to ensure each subgroup 
of patients (BRCA, non-BRCA/LOH+, and non-BRCA/LOH-) would contain an adequate number of patients. 
Part 2: The objective of Part 2 was to estimate the ORR in each of the HRD subgroups (BRCA, non-BRCA LOH+, 
non-BRCA LOH-, and unknown) in a more heavily pretreated patient population (at least 3, but no more than 4, 
prior chemotherapy regimens). Overall, there is a need for new treatments and alternatives to chemotherapy for 
heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients with advanced, relapsed disease. Based on the promising response 
rate seen in Part 1, ORR was chosen as a primary endpoint with the following sample size assumption. Up to 300 
patients were to be enrolled in Part 2 of the study in order to enrol at least 80 patients in each HRD subgroup. 
A total of 300 patients would be sufficient assuming an approximate 33.3% allocation to each HRD subgroup in 
the enrolment population. 
Randomisation 
Both studies are non-randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies are open label studies. 
Statistical methods 
Study CO-338-010 Part 2A 
The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated in the efficacy-evaluable population in Part 2A of the study. The 
ORR was summarized with frequencies and proportion together with 95% CI of the proportion using 
Clopper-Pearson methodology. 
Efficacy-evaluable Population consisted of all patients who met eligibility criteria, received at least 1 dose of 
rucaparib, had measurable tumour lesions at baseline, and had at least 1 post- baseline disease assessment. 
DOR for any confirmed RECIST CR or PR was measured from the date of the first response until the first date that 
PD is documented. DOR was summarized as a time to event variable. For patients who continue treatment 
post-progression, the first date of progression was used for the analysis. Any patients with an ongoing response 
were censored at the date of the last post- baseline scan. The Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to 
summarize DOR. If able to be estimated, the 50th (median) percentile together with a 95% CI, was presented. 
The number of patients with PD events and the number of censored patients were also presented

Study CO-338-017 
Efficacy-evaluable Population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of rucaparib, had at least 1 
measureable tumour lesion at baseline, and had at least 1 post-baseline tumour scan assessment using RECIST 
Version 1.1 
Data were summarized separately for Parts 1 and 2 of this study and were pooled as appropriate. 
The summary tables were presented for all treated patients and by the subgroups defined by HRD status (BRCA, 
non-BRCA LOH+, non-BRCA LOH-, and unknown). 
Quantitative variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages for appropriate categorizations and 
could also be summarized using descriptive statistics. For variables summarized with descriptive statistics, the 
following were presented: N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables 
were presented using frequencies and percentages. 
The Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to any time to event endpoint. If estimable, the 50th (median) together 
with a 95% CI together with range was presented. The number of patients with events and the number of 
censored patients were also presented.

Conduct of the study 
Baseline data 
In the part 2A of the study CO-338-010, the median age was 56.5 years (range, 42.0 to 84.0 years). The median 
time since cancer diagnosis was 43.1 months (range, 6.3 to 177.9 months). All 42 patients had high-grade 
ovarian cancer, which was classified as serous in 88.1% of patients. All 42 patients had a gBRCA mutation 
(assessed locally) as required for study eligibility: 30 patients had a gBRCA1 mutation and 12 patients had a 
gBRCA2 mutation. All 42 patients in Part 2A had at least 2 prior anticancer therapies, per protocol inclusion 
criteria. The median number of prior anticancer therapies and prior chemotherapies was 2 (range, 2 to 4). A 
majority of patients (64.3%) received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Two patients (4.8%) received prior 
hormonal therapies (1 or 2 prior regimens) in additional to their prior chemotherapy and platinum regimens. All 
42 ovarian cancer patients received at least 2 prior platinum-based therapies and, as required for eligibility, 
their last treatment was platinum-based to which they were sensitive. The median PFI from the last platinum- 
based regimen was 8.0 months (range 6-116 months). 
Within the subgroup of BRCA in the part 1 of the study CO-338-017, the median age was 58.5 years (range, 
33-78 years). The majority of patients had epithelial ovarian cancer (95.0% BRCA) and most patients had 
serous histology (97.5% BRCA). The median time since diagnosis was 37.1 months in the BRCA subgroup. 
Approximately one-third of patients had received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens (35.0% BRCA), including 2 
platinum-based regimens (37.5% BRCA). Germline BRCA was detected in 20 patients whereas somatic BRCA 
was reported in 19 patients (there was one patient with unknown status). BRCA1 and BRCA2 were 29 and 11 
subjects respectively. 
In part 2 (BRCA subgroup), the median age was 60.5 years. The majority of patients had epithelial ovarian 
cancer (81.6% BRCA) and most patients had serous histology (92.1% BRCA). Germline BRCA was detected in 
30 patients whereas somatic BRCA was reported in only 4 patients (there were 4 patients with unknown status). 
BRCA 1 and BRCA2 were 16 and 22 subjects respectively The median time since diagnosis was longer than for 
patients in Part 1, with 51.7 months in the BRCA subgroup. Over one-fourth of patients had received 4 prior 
chemotherapy regimens (26.3% BRCA). Approximately 74% had received 3 prior platinum-based regimens 
(BRCA subgroup). By inclusion criteria, all patients were required to have received at least 3 but no more than 
4 prior chemotherapy regimens. The median PFI from the last platinum-based regimen was notably shorter for 
patients in Part 2 compared to those in Part 1, with 4.1 and 10.7 months for the BRCA subgroup in part 2 and 
part 1 respectively. Only 31.6% of BRCA subgroup had platinum-sensitive disease vs 100% in the part1. The 
remaining patients were platinum-resistant (52.6% BRCA) or platinum-refractory (15.8% BRCA). 
In the light of baseline characteristics, the pool of both studies (only BRCA positive) is characterised by a 
population mainly platinum sensitive (92 patients out of 120) with a median of 2 prior platinum therapies and 
with germline BRCA (90 patients). Having said that and considering only the target population (≥ 2 prior 
chemotherapy regimens, including at least 2 platinum-based regimens and BRCA positive; 106 patients), the 
baseline characteristics of this subgroup (target population) are defined a group of patients previously treated 
with 2 or 3 prior platinum regimens and mainly platinum-sensitive, with only 7 patients (6.6%) considered 
platinum-refractory and 21 (19.8%) platinum-resistant. Eighty-eight patients were germline BRCA (83%) and 
13 (12.3%) somatic BRCA (there were 5 patients with unknown status). Sixty-seven were BRCA1 and 
thirty-nine were BRCA2.

Pooled data from both studies in the target population. 
Demographic data for all patients included in the primary efficacy analysis population (N = 106). The population 
includes 106 female patients with BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer who received ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens 
and received at least 1 dose of 600 mg rucaparib. Overall, the majority of patients were White (78.3%). Patients 
had a median age of 59.0 years (range, 33.0-84.0 years). Patients were recruited at clinical sites in North 
America (53.8%), Europe (29.2%), and other regions (17.0%; Australia and Israel). All patients had an ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1 at baseline. Patients were primarily nonsmokers (66.0%) or former smokers 
(28.3%). 
The median time since diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 52.1 months (range, 6.3-196.6 months). The majority 
of patients had EOC (85.8%) and serous histology (91.5%). All patients had received ≥ 2 prior anticancer 
therapies (mean ± standard deviation [StD], 2.9 ± 0.86; range, 2.0-6.0). The mean ± StD number of prior 
platinum regimens was 2.5 ± 0.67 (range, 2.0-5.0), with 56.6%, 37.7%, and 5.7% of patients having received 
2, 3, and > 3 prior platinum-based regimens, respectively. The median PFI following the most recent platinum

regimen was 7.9 months. Slightly more than half (51.9%) of all patients had a PFI of ≥ 6 to 12 months following 
their most recent platinum-based regimen, and 26.4% of patients had a PFI of < 6 months following their most 
recent platinum-based regimen. Of note, platinum-sensitivity was not required in Part 2 of Study CO-338-017 
and the median PFI following the most recent platinum regimen was 2.5 months. 
Numbers analysed 
Study CO-338-010 Part 2A 
The efficacy-evaluable population included 40 patients from Part 2A 
A total of 42 patients in Part 2A received at least 1 dose of rucaparib, of whom 6 remained ongoing as of the 29 
April 2016 visit cut-off date. 
Study CO-338-017 
The study is ongoing and the data presented herein are from patients enrolled up to 1 October 2015, with a visit 
data cutoff of 29 April 2016. There were 315 patients enrolled and with data available as of the cut-off date, and 
all patients initiated treatment with 600 mg BID of rucaparib. 
Enrolment into Part 1 of CO-338-017 initiated in October 2013 and was completed in December 2014. A total of 
204 patients were treated with rucaparib in this portion of the study. Of these, 40 were identified as having a 
deleterious BRCA mutation in their screening biopsy or archival tumour sample based on the results of the CTA. 
BRCA mutation analysis for a subset of these patients was subsequently performed using the validated FMI test 
(CDx). 
Enrolment into Part 2 of Study CO-338-017 initiated in March 2015. A total of 111 patients were treated with 
rucaparib in this portion of the study as of the enrolment cut-off date of 1 October 2015 for this assessment 
report. Of these, 38 patients were identified as having a deleterious BRCA mutation in their screening biopsy or 
archival tumour sample based on the results of the CTA. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy analyses were performed for the safety population of ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, 
defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of 600 mg rucaparib. The breakdown of patients included in 
the efficacy analyses are as follows: 
• Study CO-338-010 Part 2A gBRCA (N = 42 patients with ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens) 
• Study CO-338-017 Part 1 BRCA subgroup (N = 24 patients with ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens) 
• Study CO-338-017 Part 2 BRCA subgroup (N = 40 patients with ≥ 3 prior chemotherapy regimens) 
The visit cut-off dates allowed for the last patients enrolled to have ≥ 4 disease assessment scans (ie, ≥ 6 
months on treatment).

Table 14. Confirmed Objective Response Rate Based on Investigator- assessed Response: Primary Efficacy 
Population 
Confirmed ORR by RECIST Version 1.1 as assessed by central IRR was a supportive analysis. In the overall 
primary efficacy population, confirmed ORR by IRR (44.3% [95% CI, 34.7%-54.3%]) was lower than the 
confirmed ORR with investigator-assessed responses (53.8% 95% CI, 43.8%-63.5%]). Comparison of IRR 
versus investigator-assessed response in each study and part revealed a similar difference, though these data 
should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of patients in each study portion. The ORR by IRR was 
lower by 5%, 21%, and 8% in Study CO-338-010 Part 2A, Study CO-338-017 Part 1, and Study CO-338-017 
Part 2, respectively, compared with investigator assessment of response. 
The difference in response assessment of the individual cases between the investigator review and the 
independent review in Study CO-338-017 Part 1 was further explored. Overall, 11 of 24 patients in Study 
CO-338-017 Part 1 had a discordant best overall response assessment. This included 4 patients with a PR by 
investigator and SD by IRR, 3 patients with a CR by investigator and a PR by IRR, 2 patients with a PR by 
investigator and a CR by IRR, 1 patient with a PR by investigator and PD by IRR, and 1 patient with SD by 
investigator and PD by IRR. The scans for these 11 patients were provided to an external, independent peer 
reviewer at an earlier data cut-off date (29 February 2016) in order to assess the reasons for discordance. The 
peer reviewer found no error by either the investigator or IRR for the majority (7 of 11) of patients reviewed, 
including 2 patients that were assessed as having a response (PR in each case) by investigator, but not by IRR. 
In the remaining 4 patients the independent peer reviewer found 3 errors by the investigator, including lesion 
selection at screening, assessment of non-target lesion progression, or determination of date of progression, 
and 1 error by IRR, which was lack of identification of target at screening. In the latter case this resulted in a best 
overall response of SD by IRR as compared to PR by investigator. The reviewer also assessed scans for a 12th

patient with prolonged durable SD as assessed by both investigator and IRR assessment. In this case the 
independent reviewer noted that the target lesion selection by the investigator was in error; however, this did 
not affect the outcome and the overall assessment of SD by both investigator and IRR was correct. As there was 
no systematic issue identified, the discordance in the other study portions was not further investigated. Overall, 
the IRR results are consistent with response assessment by the investigators, both in the individual study parts 
and in the overall primary efficacy population. The variability observed between investigator and IRR assessed 
responses was considered to result from differences in target lesion selection rather than from assessment 
errors. Given the extent of non-measurable disease in advanced ovarian cancer, including the presence of 
ascites, the consistent selection of appropriate target lesions is often subjective between different individuals.

The median duration of response was 294.0 days (95% CI, 202-392 days), or approximately 9.7 months. 
Duration of response data were censored at the date of the last post-baseline scan for 24 patients; 16 of whom 
had an ongoing response at the time of data cut-off. 
The median duration of response for patients with CR or PR as determined by IRR assessment is reported 
separately for each reader. The median duration of response for Radiologist 1 and Radiologist 2 was 231.0 days 
(95% CI, 168-not assessable [NA] days), or approximately 7.6 months and 231.0 days (95% CI, 169-659 
days), or approximately 7.6 months, respectively. Duration of response was censored for 24 and 23 patients for 
Radiologist 1 and Radiologist 2, respectively. 
The endpoint of ORR based on RECIST or GCIG CA-125 criteria is defined as the best confirmed response of CR 
or PR using RECIST Version 1.1 or a confirmed response per GCIG CA-125 criteria. The endpoint of CA-125 
response rate is defined as a 50% reduction from baseline in CA-125 measurement as assessed by GCIG 
criteria. 
The confirmed ORR by RECIST (with responses assessed by the investigator) or GCIG CA-125 criteria was 
71.7% (95% CI, 62.1%-80.0%). Thirty-nine of 40 (97.5%) patients who achieved a radiologic response and 
were also evaluable for a GCIG CA-125 response, achieved a tumour marker response. In general, the GCIG 
CA-125 response tracked very closely with the RECIST response and in some cases preceded the radiologic 
response. In addition, 15 patients with a best overall response of SD achieved a GCIG CA-125 response. The 
confirmed ORR by RECIST (with responses assessed by IRR) or GCIG CA-125 criteria was 65.1% (95% CI, 
55.2%-74.1%)

The median PFS for rucaparib by investigator assessment was 10.0 months (95% CI, 7.4-12.5 months). PFS 
data were censored at the date of the last visit for 42 patients, of whom 23 remained ongoing with rucaparib 
treatment.

51.6%-76.9%, N = 60], and 53.8% [95% CI, 43.8%-63.5%, N = 106] for patients with 1, 2, and ≥ 2 prior 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, respectively. The median duration of response was 224.0 days 
(approximately 7.4 months), 270.0 days (approximately 8.9 months), and 294.0 days (approximately 9.7 
months), as assessed by the investigator, for patients with 1, 2, and ≥ 2 prior platinum chemotherapy regimens, 
respectively, as assessed by the investigator. Confirmed ORR by investigator-assessed response: 73.9% [95% 
CI, 51.6%-89.8%, N = 23], 61.8% [95% CI, 47.7%-74.6%, N = 55], and 21.4% [95% CI, 8.3%-41.0%, N = 
28] for patients with a PFI of > 12 months, ≥ 6 to 12 months, and < 6 months, respectively. The median 
duration of response, as assessed by the investigator, was 414.0 days (approximately 13.6 months), 270.0 days 
(approximately 8.9 months), and 115.0 days (approximately 3.8 months), for PFI intervals of > 12 months, ≥

6 to 12 months and < 6 months, respectively. Confirmed ORR by investigator-assessed response: 65.4% [95% 
CI, 53.8%-75.8%, N = 78], 28.6% [95% CI, 11.3%-52.2%, N = 21], and 0% [95% CI, 0.0%-41.0%, N = 7] for 
platinum-sensitive, resistant, and refractory patients, respectively. 
An additional subgroup analysis of PFS by platinum status (sensitive, resistant, or refractory) was performed. 
The median PFS was highest in platinum-sensitive patients (11.1 months [95% CI, 8.4-12.9, N = 78]). The 
median PFS in platinum-resistant patients was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.8-NA, N = 21). Even though no patient 
with platinum-refractory disease achieved a RECIST response, the median PFS in this group was 5.3 months 
(95% CI, 1.7 – NA, N = 7). These data should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of 
platinum-refractory (N = 7) and platinum-resistant (N = 21) patients. 
Among the platinum-sensitive patients (N=78), the majority (55/78, 70.5%) were partially platinum-sensitive 
(PFI from last platinum dose of 6 to 12 months) and the rest (N=23) were fully sensitive to platinum (PFI >12 
months). The median PFS was longer in the fully platinum-sensitive group than the partially sensitive group 
(12.9 vs. 9.3 months).

Comparison of efficacy data for the initial MAA and Day 120 Update show that confirmed ORR, DOR, and PFS for 
investigator-assessed responses are very similar (Tables 17 ,18 and 19). 
The data are considered mature. There was a censoring rate of 42.1% for DOR at the time of the initial MAA visit 
cut-off; at the Day 120 Update the censoring rate was 29.3%. For PFS, the censoring rate was 39.6% and 
21.7% at the time of the initial MAA and Day 120 Update visit cut-offs, respectively. Most the remaining 
censored patients discontinued the studies before a progression event was observed. 
The studies remain ongoing and the Applicant plans to provide final analyses upon study completion.

The Day 120 Update assessment of PFS continued to show that PFS did not differ significantly for rucaparib 
compared to PFS for the immediate prior line of chemotherapy (Figure 14).  The median PFS for rucaparib was 
approximately 10.0 months (initial MAA) and 9.5 month (Day 120 Update). 
Ancillary analyses 
Given that the patients treated with rucaparib included in the efficacy analysis were enrolled in single-arm 
studies and no assessment against a comparator within the same patient population was possible, an 
exploratory analysis of PFS with rucaparib treatment versus that with the immediately preceding chemotherapy 
treatment was performed. Therefore, in this analysis, the efficacy cohort is used as a control cohort. The PFS for 
rucaparib (median, 9.5 months [95% CI, 7.4-11.1 months]) is similar to the PFS for the immediately preceding 
chemotherapy regimen (median, 12.4 months [95% CI, 11.2-13.6 months; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.197, log-rank 
p-value = 0.2228).

Day 120 Update 
OS data were not presented in the initial MAA, as OS was not a primary or key secondary endpoint in the 
summary of clinical efficacy statistical analysis plan. Per protocol, post progression survival data are only being 
collected for patients enrolled in Study CO-338-010 Part 2B and Study CO-338-017 Part 2. Data for Study 
CO-338-010 Part 2B were not presented in the application as no patients had enrolled as of the 01 October 2015 
cut-off. The Applicant has analysed available OS data from the primary efficacy analysis population (N=106) 
(Figure 15) and from the subset of patients from CO-338-017 Part 2 (N=40) (Figure 16). Patients were 
censored at the last date known to be alive.

The median OS in the primary efficacy analysis population (N=106) has not yet been defined but the lower 
boundary of the 95% confidence interval is 21.7 months. Hanker et al reported a median OS ranging from 5 to 
11 months in patients receiving third or later line therapy. Lorusso et al reported a median OS of approximately 
18 months in a population with BRCA-mutated tumours or a BRCA-like clinical phenotype who had received 2 or 
more previous lines of chemotherapy. Sehouli et al reported a median OS of approximately 10 to 14 months in 
a 2-arm study of treosulphan in patients who had a median of 2 previous chemotherapy lines. 
Most patients in CO-338-017 Part 2 (N=40) had platinum-resistant or refractory disease, and all were receiving 
rucaparib as fourth or fifth-line treatment. Median OS has not yet been defined but the lower boundary of the 
95% confidence interval is 16 months. Lorusso et al reported median OS < 12 months in a platinum-resistant 
population with tumour BRCA (tBRCA) mutation or BRCA-like clinical phenotype.

•  Age 
For patients aged < 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 to 86 years, the confirmed ORR by investigator-assessed 
response was 51.5% (95% CI, 39.0%-63.8%, N = 68), 67.9% (95% CI, 47.6%-84.1%, N = 28), and 30.0% 
(95% CI, 6.7%-65.2%, N = 10), respectively. The confirmed ORR by RECIST and GCIG CA-125 criteria was 
70.6%, 85.7% and 40.0% for patients aged < 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 to 86 years, respectively. 
Although response rates by both criteria were lower for patients aged 75 to 86 years, the data should be 
interpreted with caution given the low number of patients in this subgroup. In all 3 age groups, patients 
achieved a decrease in the sum of target lesions. For patients aged < 65 years and 75 to 86 years, the median 
duration of response, as assessed by the investigator, was 288.0 days (approximately 9.5 months) and 170.0 
days (approximately 5.6 months), respectively; for the 65 to 74 years age group, at the data cut-off, the median 
duration of response was not calculable. 
•  Race 
Analyses of efficacy data by race (White vs. non-White) should be interpreted with caution as only 13 patients 
were non-White compared to 83 patients who were White. The confirmed ORR by investigator-assessed 
response was 55.4% (95% CI, 44.1%-66.3%, N = 83) and 46.2% (95% CI, 19.2%-74.9%, N = 13), for White 
and non-White patients, respectively. The median duration of response, as assessed by the investigator, was 
319.0 days (approximately 10.5 months) and 232.0 days (approximately 7.6 months), respectively. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant initially applied for rucaparib (as CMA) in an indication that encompasses the treatment of 
advanced ovarian cancer in adult patients with deleterious BRCA-mutated tumours, inclusive of both germline 
BRCA (gBRCA) and somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutations, and who have been treated with 2 or more prior lines of 
chemotherapy. 
In order to support this CMA two open label clinical studies have been submitted. 
Study CO-338-010 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, open-label, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and efficacy study of 
oral rucaparib monotherapy in advanced gBRCA-mutant solid tumours and relapsed ovarian cancer. 
Study CO-338-017 is an ongoing 2-part, open label Phase 2 study of oral monotherapy rucaparib in relapsed, 
high-grade ovarian cancer patients designed to identify ovarian cancer patients that are likely to respond to 
rucaparib. 
These studies are ongoing and the Applicant is recommended to provide final data for the studies. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CO-338-010 encompasses three (four) different parts. Part 1 evaluated escalating doses (from 40 mg 
once daily (QD) to 840 mg BID) of rucaparib in advanced gBRCA-mutant solid tumours and identified 600 mg 
BID as the recommended starting dose for subsequent studies. Part 2A enrolled patients with relapsed, 
platinum-sensitive disease who received 2 to 4 prior treatment regimens and were known to harbor a gBRCA 
mutation based on results from local testing. The last treatment received must have been a platinum-based 
regimen to which the patient must have been sensitive (ie, disease progression occurred at least 6 months after 
last dose of platinum was administered). Part 2B enrolled advanced ovarian cancer patients who received ≥3 
prior chemotherapy regimens and have either a gBRCA or sBRCA mutation. Part 3 characterized the PK, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 107/167 
  
  
including the effect of food, of a higher dose strength (300 mg) rucaparib tablet in advanced solid tumour 
patients with a BRCA mutation. Only efficacy data from Part 2A has been submitted, since part 1 was a dose 
finding substudy and in Part 2B no patients were enrolled as of the enrolment cut-off date (1 October 2015).  
Study CO-338-017 encompasses two different parts. Part 1 enrolled patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive 
disease who had received ≥ 1 prior platinum regimen. Part 2 enrolled patients who have received at least 3, and 
no more than 4, prior chemotherapy regimens, and they can be resistant or refractory, as well as sensitive, to 
their last platinum-based regimen. 
Population recruited 
Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the population recruited in the two clinical studies can be considered 
a broad ovarian cancer population, with both sensitive and resistant/refractory patients, BRCA1 and BRCA2 
mutation, somatic and germline and with different number of previous treatment.  
The primary efficacy population comprises 106 ovarian cancer patients harbouring a deleterious BRCA mutation 
who received 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy. Additionally, supportive efficacy data are also available 
for an additional 17 ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation who received only 1 prior chemotherapy 
regimen. 
Treatment 
Patients in both studies (Part 2A of CO-338-010 and all parts of CO-338-017) received 600 mg BID, but the 
duration of the cycles is different. 21 and 28 day-cycles were defined in part 2A of CO-338-010 and all parts of 
CO-338-017 respectively. This difference may be relevant in the assessment of tumour progression, since these 
evaluations were carried out at different times according to the cycles’ duration. 
Endpoints 
In the study CO-338-010, ORR by investigator was the primary endpoint. In the study CO-338-017 there were 
two primary endpoints, one in each part (PFS by investigator in part1 and ORR by investigator in part 2). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the light of baseline characteristics, the pool of both studies (only BRCA positive) is characterised by a 
population mainly platinum-sensitive (92 patients out of 120) with a median of 2 prior platinum therapies and 
with germline BRCA (90 patients). Considering only the target population (≥2 prior chemotherapy regimens, 
including at least 2 platinum-based regimens and BRCA positive; 106 patients), the baseline characteristics of 
this subgroup (target population) are defined a group of patients previously treated with 2 or 3 prior platinum 
regimens and mainly platinum-sensitive, with only 7 patients (6.6%) considered platinum-refractory and 20 
(18.9%) platinum-resistant. Eighty-eight patients were germline BRCA (83%) and 18 (17.0%) somatic BRCA 
(there were 5 patients with unknown status). Sixty-seven were BRCA1 and thirty-nine were BRCA2. 
Focusing on the target population (n=106; primary efficacy population) the use of rucaparib in the whole subset 
clearly shows an anti-tumour activity. Confirmed ORR by investigator was 54.7% (95% CI, 44.8-64.4%), 
which seems to be durable given that the median duration of response was 288 days (95% CI, 202-392 days), 
or approximately 9.7 months. In the overall primary efficacy population, confirmed ORR by IRR was slightly 
lower, as can be expected (44.3% [95% CI, 34.7%-54.3%]). The median duration of the response by IRR was 
shorter (7.6 months) than the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 108/167 
  
  
Overall, the ORR observed in the primary efficacy population appears to be similar to that observed in  Study 10 
(59.5%) but dissimilar to ORR from Study CO-338-017 (Part1 ORR 80.0% in BRCA population; Part2 ORR 
39.5% in BRCA population). This discrepancy is likely due to the different populations included in Study 
CO-338-017, where both patients with only 1 prior platinum-based therapy, and ≥ 2 platinum prior therapies 
were included. 
One subgroup of interest was the germline/somatic BRCA and BRCA1/BRCA2. The analysis of the BRCA 
mutation was prospectively and centrally analysed at FMI in Study CO-338-017 (Parts 1 and 2) and 
retrospectively collected from patients in Study CO-338-010 Part 2A. Results in ORR according to the BRCA1 vs 
BRCA2 and sBRCA vs gBRCA do not reveal difference in the former (53.7% vs 53.8% respectively) and slightly 
differences in the latter (46.2% vs 53.4% respectively).  
There was no important decrease in median PFS compared to immediate prior chemotherapy in the full 
population (N=106; Day 120 Update - 289 vs. 376 days). This holds true for the platinum-resistant 
and -refractory populations where PFS on rucaparib is numerically longer than prior chemotherapy (resistant- 
282 vs. 203 days; refractory – 162 vs. 105 days). 
OS data by subgroups, although apparently immature and limited by the quite small sample size of some 
subgroups, show a marked difference in K-M curves for platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients. 
The results in platinum-resistant patients are not sufficient with regards to efficacy and this patient population 
is not considered further. The final indication population was revised to reflect this. It was also considered that 
the histological specification of “high-grade serous epithelial” is likely unnecessary according to current clinical 
practice. 
ORR in platinum-sensitive patients was 64.6% by investigator and 53.2% by IRR, DOR was 9.1 and 8.8 
months respectively. Differences in this subgroup are consistent with those previously seen and although could 
be of concern, in a worst case scenario 53.2% is still considered of compelling clinical relevance.  
Acknowledging differences between study designs and importantly taking into account that rucaparib was 
administered in a later setting (3rd-4th line) an ORR of 64.6% (53.2% by IRR) was observed for the 
platinum-sensitive subset being even greater in the subset of patients that received rucaparib as 3rd line therapy 
(ORR 68.3%, data not shown) which is considered clinically compelling for the setting of platinum-sensitive 
population. It is likely that an ORR of such magnitude could translate into long-term clinical benefit as further 
supported by preliminary OS data. 
Focusing in the specific population of these 79 patients, the observed benefit appears consistent across the 
different PFI subgroups of platinum sensitivity. 
The comparison of PFS for rucaparib in this subgroup of platinum-sensitive patients vs the PFS for the 
immediately preceding chemotherapy regimen showed a trend for differences between previous chemo and 
rucaparib, though not significant likely due to the sample size. A decline line after line is somehow acceptable for 
rucaparib, as pointed out by data from subgroups analysis for ORR according to treatment line and further 
supported by data from other PARPi, olaparib which showed a decrease in ORR line after line (Annals of Oncology 
27: 1013–1019, 2016). 
Data in the literature (CALYPSO and Oza et al.) showed response rates of around 60% for platinum doublets 
which could be considered below rucaparib findings (ORR 64.5% for the platinum-sensitive subset being even 
greater in the subset of patients that received rucaparib as 3rd line therapy (ORR 68.3%) if the fact that 
rucaparib patients were treated in later treatment lines were considered (≥3rd line vs 2nd-3rd line rucaparib vs 
comparators respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 109/167 
  
  
There was not an outstanding effect for rucaparib as compared to the likely most active (most studied) 
alternative in this new setting, i.e. the combination of trabectedin+PLD (see tables below). The only data 
available in BRCAm come from only 24+17 patients retrospectively analysed from the OVA-301 study (Monk et 
al; Annals of Oncology 2015) that showed a median PFS of 13.6 months (versus 5.5 months in the PLD alone 
arm) in a population that had received at least 1 prior platinum treatment and was treated with trabectedin-PLD 
(platinum-sensitive). ORR for the overall population of BRCAm patients (irrespective of platinum sensitivity) in 
OVA-301 trial was 63% (15/24) in those treated with trabectedin+PLD and 29% (5/17) in those treated with 
PLD alone. 
The proposed restricted population has limited efficacious treatment options, with worse expected toxicity than 
PARPi. All in all, if taking into account that rucaparib was studied in a later line setting it seems likely that even 
in a worst-case scenario, rucaparib findings could be comparable to those of trabectedin+PLD in terms of 
efficacy. 
From a mechanistic point of view, the role of rucaparib in the platinum-sensitive population seems further 
supported given that sensitivity to platinum adducts indicate deficiency in HRD with reduced ability to repair 
DNA damage, which is closely linked to PARPi mechanism of action. Although this makes platinum-sensitive 
patients more likely to benefit from PARP inhibition it is possible that activity of rucaparib may not be limited to 
platinum-sensitive patients (ORR between 35-25% in platinum-resistant population). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 110/167 
  
  
 
 
There are no data to answer the question whether rucaparib could be used to treat a relapse in a patient 
previously treated with olaparib to maintain the remission. Rucaparib should not be used in patients who have 
previously progressed on PARPi treatment. Relevant information in this regard has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Efficacy has been established on the basis of durable ORR. The magnitude of this effect is such that it can be 
assumed that this will result in a favourable effect on long-term outcomes such as PFS and OS. Although the 
durable response in a high proportion of patients is considered a benefit, and the data observed for time-related 
endpoints are reassuring that the efficacy is adequate compared to available treatment options, there is a need 
to further quantify the efficacy of rucaparib in the therapeutic context of the approved indication in terms of 
time-related outcomes in a comparative trial.  
Regarding the future submission of comprehensive data, study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) is likely to confirm 
findings of rucaparib in the same population in which CMA is applied for (OC patients that has received at least 
2 prior lines of therapy). The study will enrol a BRCA mutated population, irrespective of platinum-sensitivity. 
The applicant has detailed the support it intends to provide to sustain recruitment at the planned rate and report 
data in Q2 2023. Despite the increasing clinical use of PARP inhibitors, the applicant’s calculations and 
assumptions regarding patient enrolment can be accepted. This trial is likely to provide comprehensive data 
suitable to confirm efficacy of Rubraca in the approved indication. 
Additional expert consultation 
A SAG-O meeting was held on February the 13th. 
The SAG oncology was invited to provide its opinion on the following points: 
1.  What are the available treatment options in this target population, to what extent are these 
regimens used in clinical practice, what is the expected efficacy and safety and to what extent 
are these documented in patients with BRCA mutant, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer? 
The SAG discussed available options in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. The SAG agreed that as long as 
platinum-containing regimens (doublets; monotherapy) are an available option, these are the preferred options 
from an efficacy point of view. However, the SAG acknowledged that there is a group of patients in whom 
platinum-containing regimens are contraindicated (e.g., allergy). There is also a group of patients who, having 
discussed preferred options, may refuse further platinum-containing treatment, including single agent 
carboplatin, due to expected toxicity. In these two groups of patients, available options are limited. The regimen 
considered to be associated with highest activity is the (approved) combination of trabectedin+PLD. However, 
this regimen is not often used due to the considerable toxicity.  
The SAG agreed that rucaparib has a much more favourable toxicity profile compared to chemotherapy including 
trabectedin+PLD. (Certain aspects though should be clarified for a better understanding of risks, like 
mechanisms behind the mostly transient liver enzyme elevation; toxicity of metabolites; transient or stable 
dynamics of most important toxicity; relationship between dose-intensity/PK and efficacy/toxicity; causal role in 
second malignancies based on molecular characterisation; generalisability of choice of treatment and 
compliance from the trial to real-life).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 111/167 
  
  
 
The SAG agreed that, in principle, having an additional (selective) option with a different toxicity profile and 
different route of administration in this restricted group of patients could be an important additional treatment 
option for some patients. However, the relevance of any advantage in safety needs to be assessed in the context 
of the efficacy data for rucaparib. A number of aspects related to the rucaparib development and results 
(patient, disease and treatment characteristics; dose-response relationships; plausibility of subgroup and 
statistical aspects including multiplicity) were discussed and uncertainties identified. 
For instance, objective criteria for inclusion in the studies were lacking and information on subsequent 
(platinum-based) treatment was lacking, or information on how PFS before study entry correlated with the 
observed PFS after rucaparib (patient-level analysis) was not available. Due to the remaining uncertainty, the 
SAG views diverged on whether efficacy had been sufficiently established in these subgroups.  
According to one (prevailing) view, fully acknowledging all the uncertainties (selection bias; lack of data on 
efficacy by prior treatments comparing PFS at study entry to PFS on-study; PFS2; lack of parallel comparative 
data; doubts about how many patients studied actually represent the target population; questions on 
generalisability) the activity shown in terms of objective response rate (ORR) and duration was high and 
convincing enough to rule out a significant detriment compared to trabectedin+PLD, on the basis of the 
observed effect of trabectedin+PLD (less than 2 months difference in median PFS compared to PLD alone for 
patients with platinum sensitive disease, and with a PFS of 13.5 months and a response rate of 63% for BRCA 
mutated platinum sensitive patients after second line chemotherapy; Monk et al. 2015), the high ORR 
associated with rucaparib in a more extensively pre-treated population compared to trabectedin historical 
control (even assuming a more pessimistic point estimate for rucaparib of 45% ORR to account for the 
retrospective selection of patients), and that the population studied was sufficiently representative. According to 
this view there were no significant concerns about potential detrimental effect (albeit, this would have to be 
confirmed post-approval even if indirectly) and rucaparib represents an additional option for some patients, 
which is a clear advantage.  
According to an opposing view, the methodological flaws (including selection bias, retrospective analysis, lack of 
convincing comparative data, lack of generalisability) preclude any conclusion about the efficacy of rucaparib 
compared to trabectedin+PLD. According to this view, there are significant concerns about potential loss of 
efficacy in the absence of more definitive and direct comparative data. Furthermore, in many instances these 
patients would likely have been treated with PARP inhibitors in the maintenance setting making the target 
population somewhat theoretical. There were also concerns that patients could be misguided by apparent 
advantages in toxicity without due consideration to uncertainty about efficacy. 
2.  What is the clinical importance of the efficacy, safety (toxicity, tolerability), patient selection, 
and possibility of outpatient oral administration associated with rucaparib compared to 
available treatment options?  
The SAG agreed on the clinical importance of safety and ease of administration, but that this needs to be 
assessed in the context of efficacy results and uncertainties. The SAG disagreed on whether sufficient efficacy 
had been demonstrated. See answer to question No. 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 112/167 
  
  
3.  Is there a subset of patients in whom the unmet need/clinical importance could be greater 
compared to available treatment options (e.g., patients who cannot tolerate further 
platinum-containing regimen)? 
The SAG agreed that the population for which there is a clear unmet need is the population of patients who 
cannot tolerate (allergy; patient preference) further platinum-containing regimens. The SAG views diverged 
about the extent to which there is sufficient evidence to conclude that rucaparib fulfils that unmet need (see 
answer to question No. 1).  
Concerning the indication, it is important to mention that histological detail (high-grade serous epithelial) is 
likely unnecessary according to current practice. Thus, a potential indication could be worded like 
“…monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated 
(germline and/or somatic), high-grade serous epithelial, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, 
who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are not suitable 
for cannot tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
It is also important to ensure that there is no misunderstanding about maintenance therapy (in the absence of 
further evidence being submitted and evaluated, rucaparib should not be used for maintenance treatment after 
platinum therapy), that rucaparib should not be used in patients who have been already treated with another 
PARP inhibitor, and that when treatment choice is left to patient preferences that patients are adequately 
informed about available treatment options and uncertainties (especially in terms of efficacy). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A durable ORR of 53%-65% along with PFS results in the platinum-sensitive setting is considered clinically 
meaningful. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a 
conditional MA: 
Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) is likely to provide comprehensive clinical data suitable to confirm the findings of 
rucaparib in the same population in which CMA is applied for (OC patients that has received at least 2 prior lines 
of therapy). ARIEL4 will recruit BRCA mutated OC patients that received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, 
including both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The most relevant data for the safety evaluation of rucaparib have been collected in 3 open-label clinical studies 
(Study CO-338-010, Study CO-338-017 [ARIEL2], and Study CO-338-023 [RUCAPANC]), in which patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer or other solid tumours received 600 mg BID rucaparib until disease progression or 
other reason for discontinuation. The safety population was defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose 
of rucaparib. 
The primary safety analyses include 409 patients. Of these, 377 patients had advanced ovarian cancer, 143 of 
whom had a BRCA mutation. There were also 32 patients who had a solid tumour other than ovarian cancer. 
At day 120 of the procedure an update of the safety profile was submitted (visit cut-off of 10 April 2017). New 
data are presented at the end of each section.

Patient exposure 
The applicant provided a summary of clinical safety (SCS) which included data on patients treated with rucaparib 
600 mg BID collected in 3 open-label clinical studies: Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 [ARIEL2], as 
previously mentioned, and Study CO-338-023 [RUCAPANC]) in patients with previously treated locally advanced 
or metastatic pancreatic cancer with a known deleterious BRCA mutation. 
A total of 409 patients enrolled in Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-017, and CO-338-023 had initiated at least 1 
treatment cycle with 600 mg BID rucaparib. Of these, 377 patients had advanced ovarian cancer, 143 of whom 
had a BRCA mutation and 234 non-BRCA. There were also 32 patients with various other types of tumours. In 
the group of 143 ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, 106 patients comprise the primary efficacy 
population; the remaining 37 patients received only 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and/or were enrolled into a 
part of Study CO-338-010 where PK and safety, but not efficacy, were the primary endpoints. 
In the 409 patients with any type of tumour, the median duration of treatment was 168 days (range, 2-852 
days), and the median number of cycles initiated was 6 (range, 1-31). Overall, 15.4% of patients received > 12 
months of treatment, and 44.3% of patients received ≥ 6 months of treatment. The mean relative dose intensity 
was high (0.87), indicating that most patients received their intended dose throughout the study (Table 
2.7.4-6). 
The median duration of treatment was longer in the BRCA mutant ovarian cancer population than the non-BRCA 
and all ovarian cancer populations (224.0 days, range, 4-852 days, 112.5 days, range 3 – 680 and 168 days, 
range 3-852, respectively), although the dose intensity was slightly lower (mean [StD] 0.82 [0.19] vs. 
0.91[0.13] and 0.87[0.16], respectively). Approximately 25% of patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer 
received > 12 months of treatment, and 69.2% of patients received > 6 months of treatment. 
Of the 358 (87.5%) patients who discontinued in these studies, the most common primary reason for 
discontinuation of rucaparib was disease progression (radiologic or clinical; 79.6% overall, 79.8% of patients 
with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer). Approximately 10% of patients overall and in the BRCA mutant ovarian 
cancer population discontinued treatment due to AEs (all causality). 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
There were no notable differences in demographic characteristics between patients with BRCA mutant and 
non-BRCA mutant ovarian cancer.  
In ovarian cancer patients, the median number of prior anticancer therapies of any type was 2.0 (range, 1-8), 
with 66.3% of patients receiving ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and 65.3% receiving ≥ 2 prior 
platinum-based regimens. In patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer, the median number of prior anticancer 
therapies of any type was 3.0 (range, 1-8), with 83.9% of patients receiving ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. 
These patients had received a median of 2.0 prior chemotherapy regimens containing platinum (range, 1-5), 
and 73.4% were sensitive (defined as disease progression ≥ 6 months after the last dose of platinum) to the last 
platinum-based regimen they received. 
Updated data 
The applicant provided a data update with the responses to Day 120 questions using a more recent visit cut-off 
of 10 April 2017 i.e., up to an additional 11 months of data in order to demonstrate maturity of the clinical data.

Adverse events 
A summary of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) is presented in Table 23. 
In the overall patient population, all patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, with treatment-related TEAEs 
reported for 94.9% of patients. SAEs were reported for 29.6% of patients, with treatment-related SAEs 
occurring in 9.5% of patients. In total, 62.6% of patients experienced TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher. TEAEs led to 
treatment interruption and/or dose reduction in 64.1% of patients (treatment interruption = 58.2% of patients, 
dose reduction = 44.3%). TEAEs led to discontinuation of rucaparib in 18.8% of patients and treatment-related 
TEAEs led to discontinuation in 8.1% of patients. TEAEs with an outcome of death were reported in 3.4% of the 
study population; none of these was considered related to treatment. 
In the ovarian cancer patient population, all patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, with treatment-related TEAEs 
reported for 95.5% of patients. SAEs were reported for 27.9% of ovarian cancer patients, with 
treatment-related SAEs occurring in 9.5% of ovarian cancer patients. In total, 61.5% of ovarian cancer patients 
experienced TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher. TEAEs led to treatment interruption and/or dose reduction in 65.0% of 
ovarian cancer patients (treatment interruption = 58.9% of patients, dose reduction = 45.9%). TEAEs led to 
discontinuation of rucaparib in 18.6% of ovarian cancer patients and treatment-related TEAEs led to 
discontinuation in 8.2% of ovarian cancer patients. TEAEs with an outcome of death were reported in 2.4% of 
ovarian cancer patients; none of these was considered related to treatment. 
The TEAE profile in patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer was similar to that of the total safety population 
as well as the ovarian cancer population. In the BRCA mutant OC population, 97.9% of patients experienced 
TEAEs that were considered treatment-related. SAEs were reported for 31.5% of patients, with the incidence of 
treatment-related SAEs at 8.4%. In total, 65.7% experienced TEAEs of Grade ≥3. TEAEs led to treatment 
interruption and/or reduction in 71.3% of patients (treatment interruption = 60.8%, dose reduction = 50.3%).

TEAEs led to rucaparib discontinuation in 18.9% of patients; treatment-related TEAEs led to discontinuation in 
5.6% of patients. TEAEs with an outcome of death were reported in 3.5% of patients with BRCA mutant ovarian 
cancer; none of these was considered related to treatment.

Updated data 
Overall, the rates of TEAEs, serious AEs (SAEs), Grade 3 and higher TEAEs, and TEAEs with an outcome of death 
were comparable between patients in the primary efficacy population, patients with BRCAmut OC in the safety 
population, all OC patients, and patients in the overall safety population. The TEAEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation, dose reduction, and/or treatment interruption occurred comparably between patients with 
BRCAmut OC in the primary efficacy and safety populations, but more often for these populations compared to 
all patients with OC and the overall safety population. These higher rates are likely due to the longer duration of 
treatment of patients with BRCAmut OC (medians of 236.5 days in the efficacy population, 238.0 days in the 
BRCAmut OC safety population, 168.0 days in all OC patients, and 168.0 days in overall safety population. 
Common Adverse Events 
A summary of TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 20% of patients in any subgroup based on the incidence in SOCs and PTs 
is provided in Table 24.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs with onset dates on or after the date of first 
dose of rucaparib through the date of the last rucaparib dose plus 28 days. If all or part of the date of onset of 
the AE was missing and it could not be determined if the AE met the definition for treatment-emergent, the AE 
was considered to be treatment-emergent. 
The most common TEAEs reported in the ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation were generally 
consistent with those observed within the total ovarian cancer and the overall population. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs occurred in the MedDRA SOCs of Gastrointestinal Disorders (96.5%), General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (87.4%), Investigations (71.3%), and Nervous System Disorders (70.6%). The 
most common TEAEs, irrespective of relationship to rucaparib, were combined fatigue/asthaenia (79.7%), 
nausea (76.9%), combined anaemia/decreased haemoglobin (54.5%), vomiting (50.3%), combined ALT/AST 
increased (47.6%), constipation (41.3%), and dysgeusia (39.2%).

Frequency differences in a few specific PTs were recorded when comparing ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA 
mutation to the overall, all ovarian cancer and non- BRCA populations. These included: anaemia/ low 
haemoglobin, increased ALT/AST, thrombocytopenia/ decreased platelets, neutropenia/ decreased ANC and 
increased creatinine. This is likely a reflection of the fact that the patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer 
remained on treatment longer. An analysis of TEAE data normalized for time on treatment between patients with 
BRCA mutant ovarian cancer and other patient groups showed that the differences were less marked when 
adjusting for time on treatment. The increased frequency of anaemia and neutropenia persisted even after 
adjusting for time on treatment. Also, the laboratory data indicate that the effect of rucaparib treatment on 
haemoglobin, neutrophils and ALT/AST elevation, as measured by a shift from baseline to a worsening CTCAE 
Grade, is similar across the groups (see section on laboratory results).  
The effect of rucaparib treatment on haemoglobin, as measured by a shift from baseline to a worsening CTCAE 
Grade, is similar across the groups: 69.9% to Grade 1 to 4 (29.4% to Grade 3) in BRCA mutant ovarian cancer; 
66.6% to Grade 1 to 4 (23.3% to Grade 3) in the ovarian cancer population; 65.6% to Grade 1 to 4 (15.6% to 
Grade 3) in other tumours; and 66.5% to Grade 1 to 4 (22.7% to Grade 3) in the overall patient population. 
For most TEAEs, including haematological, the incidence within 30 days of the first dose was relatively low 
compared to the overall incidence throughout the study. However, for increased transaminases the incidence at 
30 days was relatively high in relation to the final reported incidence (e.g. BRCA mutant 37.1% at 30 days vs. 
47.6% in total; all OC 33.7% at 30 days vs. 41.4% in total). 
Consistent with the high frequency of anaemia, 74.3% of patients experienced TEAEs of asthenia or fatigue. 
These events were more common in patients with ovarian cancer (76.9%) than in patients with other tumours 
(43.8%), likely due to difference in time on rucaparib treatment between these two groups. 
An apparent difference in TEAEs of ALT/AST elevation was observed between the BRCA mutant ovarian cancer 
patients and the overall patient population; however, more objective assessment of laboratory data indicate 
that the effect of rucaparib treatment on ALT/AST, as measured by a shift from baseline to a worsening CTCAE 
grade, is similar between BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients (74.8% ALT, 70.6% AST), ovarian cancer 
patients (74.3% ALT, 73.5% AST), and the overall patient population (71.6% ALT, 71.1% AST). Patients with 
other solid tumours had a lower overall frequency of ALT/AST elevations reported as a TEAE (28.1%) and also 
had a lower frequency of shift in CTCAE grade from baseline (40.6% ALT, 43.8% AST). 
Updated data 
TEAEs in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal Disorders and General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions were 
reported most frequently in all patient populations (96.2% and 90.6%, respectively, in the efficacy population; 
96.5% and 88.8%, respectively, in patients with BRCAmut OC in the safety population; 94.4% and 84.4%, 
respectively, in the OC patient population; and 93.6% and 82.4%, respectively, in the overall safety population). 
Nausea (84%), fatigue (63.2%), and anaemia (57.5%) were the most common TEAEs reported in the efficacy 
population. In patients with BRCAmut OC in the safety population the rates of nausea (79.7%), fatigue (65.0%), 
and anaemia (53.1%) were similar to the rates in patients in the efficacy population. Nausea and fatigue also 
occurred at generally similar rates in the OC population (78.0% and 62.9%, respectively) and overall safety 
population (75.8% and 61.1%, respectively) compared to patients with BRCAmut OC; however, anaemia 
occurred at a lower rate in the OC population (42.4%) and overall safety population (41.8%) compare to the 
patient populations with BRCAmut OC. While most TEAEs occurred at similar rates across all patient populations, 
several TEAEs had similar rates between patients with BRCAmut OC in the efficacy and safety populations, but 
lower rates in the OC and overall safety populations. This is likely due to patients with BRCAmut OC having a

longer median duration of treatment (236.5 days and 238.0 days, respectively) compared to the median 
duration of treatment of 168.0 days in both the OC and overall safety populations 
Treatment-related Adverse Events 
Treatment-related TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 20% of patients based on the incidence in SOCs and PTs in any 
subgroup are summarized in Table 25.  
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the ovarian cancer population occurred in the MedDRA 
SOCs of Gastrointestinal Disorders (82.0%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (71.9%), 
Investigations (58.1%), and Nervous System Disorders (52.0%). The most common treatment-related TEAEs 
(by PT) were nausea (68.7%), combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (68.7%), combined terms of anaemia and/or 
low/decreased haemoglobin (40.6%), combined terms of ALT/AST increased (40.1%), and dysgeusia (36.6%). 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation 
occurred in the MedDRA SOCs of Gastrointestinal Disorders (80.4%), General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions (73.4%), Investigations (65.7%), and Nervous System Disorders (53.1%). The most common 
treatment-related TEAEs (by PT) were combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (71.3%), nausea (65.7%), combined

Treatment-related TEAEs also appeared to have a similar trend of consistent frequencies in patients with BRCA 
ovarian cancer in the efficacy and safety populations, but lower frequencies in the OC and overall safety 
populations, likely due to longer treatment exposure in OC patients. Overall, the most common related TEAEs for 
patients in the efficacy population were in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal Disorders (84.9%), General and

Administration Site Conditions (78.3%), and Investigations (68.9%). The most common treatment-related 
TEAEs in the efficacy population were nausea (70.8%), fatigue and anaemia (each 54.7%), ALT increase 
(45.3%), and AST increase (43.4%) 
TEAEs Grade ≥ 3  
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurring in ≥ 5% of patients in any subgroup are summarized in Table 26. 
In OC patients with a BRCA mutation, the overall incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs, regardless of causality, was 
65.7%. In OC patients with a BRCA mutation the most common Grade ≥3 TEAE by PT were combined terms of 
anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (29.4%), asthenia/fatigue (14.0%), increased ALT/AST (12.6%), 
neutropenia and/or low/decreased ANC (10.5%), malignant neoplasm progression (9.1%), and vomiting 
(5.6%).   
There were no notable differences in the total frequency of Grade ≥3 TEAEs between the overall patient 
population (62.6%) and ovarian cancer population (61.5%) as compared to patients with BRCA mutant ovarian 
cancer (65.7%), nor in the frequency for the most commonly-reported PTs.  
The greater frequency of Grade ≥3 TEAEs in non-OC patients can be attributed to the enrolment of pancreatic 
cancer patients, where the overall incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was 78.9% (Study CO-338-023 CSR).

Updated data 
Grade 3 and higher TEAEs appeared consistent between patients with BRCAmut OC in the efficacy and safety 
populations and, for most TEAEs, also consistent with the OC and overall safety populations; however, several 
TEAEs also appeared to follow the trend of being slightly more frequent in patients with BRCAmut OC in the 
efficacy and safety populations than in the OC and overall safety populations. Overall, the most common Grade 
3 or higher TEAEs for patients with BRCAmut OC in the efficacy population were in the SOCs of Blood and

was anaemia (24.7% to 31.1% of patients across all populations); almost all incidences of Grade 3 and higher 
anaemia were treatment-related. Overall, the majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in all population groups 
Treatment-related TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 
Treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in ≥ 5% of patients in any subgroup are summarized in Table 27. 
In the ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were experienced by 
49.7% of patients. The most commonly reported treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (by PT) that were combined

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are considered adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs), that were presented over the full clinical development program to 12 September 2016. During 
this time about 1077 patients have received rucaparib and 10 cases have been reported; 7 MDS and 3 AML. 
These events include AESIs reported for CO-338-010 (2 MDS), CO-338-017 (2 MDS, 1 AML), 5 patients (2 MDS, 
2 AML, 1 MDS transformed to AML) enrolled in the blinded, randomized, ongoing Study CO-338-014 and treated 
with rucaparib, and 1 patient (AML) who received  placebo in Study CO-338-014. All of the patients diagnosed 
with MDS or AML had been heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy, including platinum- and/or 
taxane-containing regimens. One patient had also received prior treatment with an alkylating agent

(cyclophosphamide) and one patient had received radiation for breast cancer. In patients diagnosed with MDS, 
duration from start of treatment to diagnosis was between 35 days and approximately 693 days; in patients 
diagnosed with AML, duration from start of treatment to diagnosis was between 106 and 850 days. All of the 
patients experienced cytopenias requiring modifications to study drug dosing or discontinuation of study drug 
prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML. The cytogenetic abnormalities observed in the 3 patients diagnosed with AML 
were consistent with aberrations (primarily abnormalities in chromosome 5) typically observed in patients with 
secondary MDS/AML due to prior chemotherapy.

Serious adverse events 
Summaries of SAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients and all treatment-related SAEs are provided in Table 28 
and Table 29, respectively. 
Overall, SAEs, regardless of causality, were experienced by 29.6% of all patients, with malignant neoplasm 
progression (5.4%) and anaemia (4.9%) reported most frequently. SAEs were experienced by 27.9% of all 
ovarian cancer patients, with malignant neoplasm progression (5.3%) and anaemia (4.8%) reported most 
frequently. In ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, malignant neoplasm progression (8.4%) and 
anaemia (5.6%) were also the most frequently reported SAEs. 
There were no notable differences in the frequency of SAEs between the overall patient population (29.6%) and 
patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer (31.5%). In ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, malignant 
neoplasm progression (8.4%) and anaemia (5.6%) were the most frequently reported SAEs. Patients with other 
tumours had a higher incidence of SAEs (50.0%) compared to those with ovarian cancer (27.9%). 
The greater frequency of SAEs in non-ovarian tumours can be attributed to some extent to the pancreatic cancer 
patients enrolled in Study CO-338-023, where the overall incidence of SAEs, regardless of causality, was 63.2%.

patients with a BRCA mutation; the most common treatment-related SAE was anaemia (4.6%, 4.5% and 5.6% 
patients respectively). No other treatment-related SAEs were experienced by more than 1% of patients overall.  
All other treatment related SAEs were reported by single patients with BRCA mutant OC, including 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, increased blood creatinine, increased 
blood cholesterol and dehydration.

Malignant neoplasm progression (7.5%) and anaemia (6.6%) were the most common SAEs in patients in the 
efficacy population; these SAEs occurred at similar rates in the other patient populations. Most SAEs of anaemia 
were related to rucaparib in all patient populations. No SAEs of malignant neoplasm progression were related to 
rucaparib.

Deaths 
TEAEs with an outcome of death are presented in Table 30. TEAEs with an outcome of death were reported in 
14/409 (3.4%) patients, including 5 patients (3.5%) with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer. 
The frequency of TEAEs with an outcome of death was higher in patients with other tumours (N = 5, 15.6%) 
compared to those with ovarian cancer (N = 9, 2.4%). Three of the 5 patients with other tumours who died were 
pancreatic cancer patients in Study CO-338-023. The most frequently reported TEAE with an outcome of death 
was malignant neoplasm progression (10 patients, 2.4%). All other TEAEs with an outcome of death were 
reported for single patients. 
Among BRCA positive ovarian cancer patients, all 5 (3.5%) patients who died were assessed as having died due 
to disease progression, with 1 (0.7%) of these deaths also involving hyponatremia. None of these deaths was 
related to rucaparib.  
Nine deaths occurred in the all ovarian cancer population, 8 due to disease progression and 1 due to sepsis in a 
patient with bilateral ureteric obstruction due to disease progression. The age of patients ranged from 35 to 75 
(mean 60.3 years). Disease progression occurred between 4 and 161 days (mean 41.1 days) of starting 
rucaparib. Four of the 9 patients presented with symptoms of progression within 13 days of starting rucaparib.

a  One patient was initially reported as experiencing an SAE of pulmonary embolism that led to discontinuation of rucaparib 
and death. The events experienced by this patient were updated to SAEs of both pulmonary embolism (not related) and 
atrial fibrillation (not related), and death due to acute respiratory failure (not related) secondary to disease progression, 
upon a follow-up SAE report after the data cut-off date for this ongoing study. 
Updated data 
The frequencies of TEAEs having an outcome of death ranged from 2.7% to 4.2% patients across the different 
patient populations. Malignant neoplasm progression was the most common TEAE with an outcome of death 
across all patient populations. An event of B-cell type acute leukaemia was the only TEAE with an outcome of 
death that was considered related to rucaparib. 
Overall, there were 31 patients who died due to TEAE(s) in Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-014, CO-338-017, 
CO-338-023, and CO-338-044. There were 10 patients (1 patient in Study CO-338-010; 6 patients in Study 
CO-338-014; and 3 patients in Study CO-338-017) with a TEAE leading to death and assessed as related to 
rucaparib by the investigator. Five of the related TEAEs leading to death were cases of MDS/ AML where 
relationship to study drug could not be ruled out; however, there are many confounding risk factors in assessing 
drug relationship in the cases of MDS/AML. Reports of general health deterioration were frequently in relation to 
progression of the patient’s underlying cancer

Laboratory findings 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grade shifts from 
baseline in key laboratory parameters are summarized in Table 31. In addition, Table 32 summarizes all Grade 
1 to 4 laboratory abnormalities that occurred during rucaparib treatment, regardless of whether there was a 
shift in CTCAE grade from baseline. The most notable laboratory abnormalities were decreased haemoglobin 
(and associated increase in mean corpuscular volume [MCV] and mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]), 
Assessment report

Page 133/167 
  
  
 
increased ALT, increased AST, and increased serum creatinine, similar to the TEAEs reported. Decreased 
platelets, neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes and increased cholesterol were observed to a lesser extent.

Haematology 
Based on laboratory data, myelosuppression was observed during rucaparib therapy, with notable shifts from 
baseline for haemoglobin concentrations and lymphocyte, platelet and neutrophil counts (Table 2.7.4-24). In 
most patients, myelosuppression was a delayed effect that manifested beyond the first cycle of treatment. There 
were no notable differences in haematological laboratory abnormalities among the tumour subgroups. 
The most frequently observed haematology laboratory finding was a decrease in haemoglobin, consistent with 
anaemia being reported as one of the most common TEAEs. A decrease in haemoglobin (CTCAE Grade 1-4) from 
baseline was observed in 66.5% of patients (Grade 3, 22.7%) in the overall patient population, 66.6% (Grade 
3, 23.3%) of all ovarian cancer patients and in 69.9% (Grade 3, 29.4%) of the BRCA mutant ovarian cancer 
patients. The Grade 3 haemoglobin laboratory observations generally occurred later in treatment (Cycle 3 Day 
1 and beyond). Anaemia was macrocytic, with increases in MCV and MCH but no apparent increase in 
reticulocytes. In ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, 49 (34.3%) received a blood transfusion (range 
= 1-10) during treatment with rucaparib; most (N=34) required one transfusion; the median time to transfusion 
was approximately 2 months. 
Anaemia was managed with supportive care as well as with dose interruption and/or dose reduction(s) (Study 
CO-338-010; Study CO-338-017). A total of 35 patients (8.6%) received an anti-anaemia concomitant 
medication (eg, iron preparation, erythropoietin) either as a supplement prior to initiating rucaparib (n = 17; 
4.2%) or as treatment for anaemia while receiving rucaparib (n = 20; 4.9%), with 1 patient (0.2%) taking iron 
supplements prior to initiating rucaparib and requiring epoetin beta during treatment with rucaparib.  
In the BRCA mutant ovarian cancer group, a decrease in lymphocytes, platelets, or neutrophils from baseline to 
a worsening CTCAE Grade occurred in 42.0%, 45.5%, and 37.1% of patients, respectively. A shift to CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 lymphocytes, platelets, or neutrophils was observed in 6.3%, 5.6%, and 9.8% of patients with BRCA 
mutant ovarian cancer, respectively. 
Similar to haemoglobin, the time of onset for CTCAE Grade ≥3 lymphocytes, platelets, or neutrophils was 
generally later in treatment (Cycle 3 Day 1 and beyond). Seven patients (1.7%) required a platelet transfusion. 
Five patients received a single transfusion of platelets; 1 patient received 5 separate platelet transfusions over 
a course of 6 days, and 1 patient received 3 separate platelet transfusions over a course of 8 days. 
Clinical Chemistry 
The majority of patients with normal clinical chemistry parameters at baseline maintained normal levels during 
treatment, with shifts to Grade 1 reported for most of the remaining patients; however, notable shifts from 
baseline were observed for creatinine, ALT, AST, and cholesterol concentrations in the majority of patients. 
There were no notable differences in clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities among the tumour subgroups, 
apart from ‘other tumours’ for AST, ALT and cholesterol. 
ALT/AST Elevations 
In all BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, an increase in ALT or AST from baseline to a worsening CTCAE grade 
occurred in 74.8% and 70.6% of patients, respectively. A shift to CTCAE Grade ≥3 ALT or AST was observed in 
13.3% and 2.8% of BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, respectively. The ALT/AST elevations occurred early 
in treatment (ie, in Cycle 1 or by Day 1 of Cycle 2) and then resolved or stabilized over time. Treatment with 
rucaparib was continued at either the initial 600 mg BID dose or a lower dose. Elevations in ALT/AST were 
generally not accompanied by a concomitant elevation in bilirubin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 135/167 
  
  
One patient with relapsed ovarian cancer developed ALT/AST > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 2 xULN without evidence 
of cholestasis (i.e. elevated ALP) after 2 weeks of rucaparib treatment. ALT, AST and bilirubin levels decreased 
when rucaparib was held and increased when dosing was resumed, suggesting a temporal relationship. The 
patient had metastatic liver disease at baseline, which confounded the assessment. The results on Cycle 1 Day 
15 were not observed at any subsequent laboratory assessment, although treatment with rucaparib continued 
for a total of 159 days. On this basis, the event was not considered to have demonstrated evidence of 
drug-induced liver injury. 
Creatinine Elevations 
In BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, an increase in serum creatinine from baseline to a worsening CTCAE 
grade occurred in 88.1% of patients (64.3% to Grade 1, 23.1% to Grade 2, and 0.7% to Grade 4; no patient had 
a shift to Grade 3). The elevations were observed early in treatment (Day 15 of Cycle 1) and then stabilized with 
continued rucaparib treatment. Serum creatinine levels decreased with interruption or discontinuation of 
rucaparib, and increase again with resumption of treatment. Rucaparib is an inhibitor of multidrug and toxin 
extrusion 1 (MATE1) and multidrug and toxin extrusion 2-K (MATE2-K) transporters and a moderate inhibitor of 
organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which mediate renal excretion of creatinine. Therefore, the elevations in 
creatinine observed in patients are thought to be due to inhibition of the renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K 
by rucaparib. 
Cholesterol Elevations 
An increase in total cholesterol from baseline to a worsening CTCAE grade occurred in 37.7%, 39.8%, and 
43.4% of all patients, all ovarian cancer patients, and BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, respectively. 
Increase to CTCAE Grade 3 or greater total cholesterol occurred in 2.2%, 2.4%, and 4.2% of all patients, all 
ovarian cancer patients, and BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, respectively. The few Grade 3 events 
observed were successfully managed by treatment modification (interrupting treatment and/or reducing the 
rucaparib dose) and/or concomitant treatment with a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 
inhibitor (statin). 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Signs 
There were no notable changes from baseline in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body 
temperature or weight. 
Prolongation of QT and cardiac toxicity 
The Phase 1 (Part 1) dose-escalation portion of Study CO-338-010 included serial ECGs (as triplicate reads) and 
independent central review in order to assess the effect of oral rucaparib on QT interval corrected (QTc). A total 
of 56 patients were enrolled and 55 patients were evaluable and ECG data were available for up to 22 cycles in 
the patient with the longest duration on treatment. Rucaparib was administered continuously at doses of 40 mg 
QD to 840 mg BID in 3-week treatment cycles.  
One patient with a history of previous episodes of prolonged QTc and a provisional diagnosis of a congenital 
prolonged QT syndrome made before study entry experienced Grade 4 ventricular tachyarrhythmia 
approximately 3 weeks after initiating rucaparib. The event was judged related to rucaparib owing to the short 
latency between starting rucaparib and the onset of the event.  
Risk of QT prolongation cannot be ruled out since the at 600 mg BID, the recommended dose, the mean values 
for change of QTcF in Cycle 1 ranged from 5.0 to 14.0 msec, which is higher than 5 ms established in the

Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Age 
A summary of TEAEs for patients aged < 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 to 86 years is presented in Table 33. 
There were no notable differences in the proportions of patients aged < 65 years (N = 240), 65 to 74 years (N 
= 125), and 75 to 86 years (N = 44) who experienced TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, SAEs, or TEAEs of Grade 
3 or higher (Table 33). Treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 were more frequently reported in patients aged 65 
to 74 years (55.2%) than in patients aged < 65 years (42.5%) or 75 to 86 years (45.5%). The incidence of 
TEAEs with an outcome of death was comparable in all subgroups (2.9%, 4.0%, and 4.5% for patients aged < 
65 years, 65-74 years, and 75-86 years, respectively). 
A greater proportion of patients aged 75 to 86 years experienced TEAEs that led to rucaparib discontinuation 
(31.8% versus 14.6% for patients aged < 65 years and 22.4% for patients aged 65-74 years). Similarly, 
patients aged 75 to 86 years experienced a higher incidence of treatment-related TEAEs leading to rucaparib 
discontinuation (18.2% versus 5.8% for patients aged < 65 years and 8.8% for patients aged 65-74 years). The 
oldest age group also experienced more TEAEs that led to treatment interruption or dose reduction. The 
incidence of TEAEs leading to dose reduction or treatment interruption was 60.4%, 68.0%, and 72.7% for 
patients aged < 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 to 86 years, respectively. Treatment-related TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction or treatment interruption were reported in 52.1%, 59.2% and 68.2% of patients aged < 65 years, 
65 to 74 years, and 75 to 86 years, respectively.

There were no notable differences in the proportions of female (N = 393) and male (N = 16) patients who 
experienced TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, TEAEs of Grade 3 or above, or TEAEs leading to rucaparib 
discontinuation, or treatment interruption. The low number of male patients precludes meaningful comparison 
between these subgroups. 
Race 
There were no notable differences in the proportions of White (N = 329) and non-White (N = 40) patients who 
experienced TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs of Grade 3 or above, or TEAEs leading to rucaparib 
discontinuation. More treatment interruptions were reported for non-Whites (75.0%) than Whites (55.6%), and 
the frequency of dose reductions was 52.5% for non-Whites versus 41.6% for Whites. 
BRCA Mutation (gBRCA, sBRCA, Unknown BRCA) versus No BRCA Mutation (Non-BRCA) 
Overall, there were no notable differences in the proportions of patients with a gBRCA mutation (N = 108), 
sBRCA mutation (N = 23), unknown germline/somatic BRCA status (N = 12), or those without a BRCA mutation 
(non-BRCA; N = 234) who experienced TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, or SAEs; however, due to the low 
number of patients with a sBRCA mutation (N = 23) or unknown germline/somatic BRCA status (n = 12), 
comparisons involving these groups should be interpreted cautiously. A greater proportion of patients with a 
gBRCA mutation experienced TEAEs and discontinuation rucaparib as compared to gBRCA, non-BRCA or all 
patients with ovarian cancer. A greater proportion of patients with a gBRCA mutation experienced TEAEs 
(regardless of causality) of Grade ≥ 3 as compared to non-BRCA patients (gBRCA mutation = 68.5%; non-BRCA 
= 59.0%) or a TEAE (regardless of causality) that led to rucaparib discontinuation, dose reduction, or treatment 
interruption (gBRCA mutation = 79.6%; non-BRCA = 65.0%); however, the frequencies of treatment-related 
TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher were comparable between gBRCA (50.9%) and non-BRCA patients (45.7%), as were

those of treatment-related TEAEs leading to rucaparib discontinuation, dose reduction, or treatment interruption 
(gBRCA = 65.7%; non-BRCA = 57.3%). Any differences observed between the gBRCA and non-BRCA groups 
may be related to the longer duration on treatment for patients with a BRCA mutation median duration of 
treatment = 224 days) versus those without (median duration of treatment = 112.5 days). This should be 
confirmed with update safety profile.  
While there was a difference in the frequency of ALT/AST elevation and anaemia AEs reported in ovarian cancer 
patients with a BRCA mutation versus in ovarian cancer patients without a BRCA mutation, there were no 
significant differences in the observed laboratory shifts for ALT/AST or haemoglobin in the subgroups. 
Specifically, 51.9% of patients with a gBRCA mutation experienced TEAEs of ALT/AST elevation compared with 
21.7% of patients with a sBRCA mutation, 58.3% of unknown germline/somatic BRCA status, and 37.6% of 
patients with no BRCA mutation. The combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin were 
reported for 57.4% of patients with a gBRCA mutation, 34.8% of patients with a sBRCA mutation, 66.7% of 
patients with unknown germline/somatic BRCA status, and 37.2% of patients with no BRCA mutation. 
Renal Impairment 
Study enrolment required serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN; 84 patients with mild renal impairment (by NCI Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group criteria as an estimated CrCL of 40-59 mL/min) were enrolled. 
The safety and effectiveness of rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with moderate (defined as 
estimated CrCL of 20-39 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (defined as CrCL < 20 mL/min) and a PK study 
specifically in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. No dose modification for renal impairment 
is proposed based on the population PK data. 
There were no notable differences in the frequencies of TEAEs between patients with or without renal 
impairment, or among the subgroups in each category (ie, BRCA mutant ovarian cancer, all ovarian cancer, and 
overall populations). All patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, with treatment-related TEAEs reported for 97.6% 
of patients with renal impairment and for 94.2% of patients without renal impairment. SAEs were reported for 
32.1% of patients with renal impairment and 28.9% of patients without renal impairment, with 
treatment-related SAEs occurring in 13.1% of patients with renal impairment and 8.6% of patients without renal 
impairment. A total of 69.0% of patients with renal impairment experienced a TEAE of Grade 3 or higher, 
compared to 60.9% of patients without renal impairment. Slightly more patients with renal impairment had a 
TEAE that led to treatment interruption and/or dose reduction as compared to patients without renal impairment 
(70.2% versus 62.5%, respectively). A TEAE (any causality) led to discontinuation of rucaparib in 29.8% of 
patients with renal impairment and 16.0% of patients without renal impairment. A treatment-related TEAE 
leading to discontinuation occurred in 15.5% of patients with renal impairment and in 6.2% of patients without 
renal impairment. A TEAE with an outcome of death was reported in 5 patients (6.0%) with renal impairment 
and in 9 patients (2.8%) without renal impairment; no TEAE that led to death was considered related to 
rucaparib. 
In the all ovarian cancer population, there were generally more TEAEs in each category for those with mild renal 
impairment compared to normal renal function. More patients with mild renal impairment compared to those 
with no renal impairment experienced Grade ≥3 TEAEs (68.8% vs. 59.6%) and TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
(28.8% vs. 15.8%), treatment interruption (70% vs. 55.9%) or dose reduction (53.8% vs. 43.8%). There were 
more TEAEs leading to death in the former group (5.0% vs. 1.7%), although none were considered treatment 
related. Taken together, these data suggest that no dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. Rucaparib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment 
(SmPC Section 4.2).

Hepatic Impairment 
Study enrolment required ALT and AST ≤3 x ULN; 46 patients with mild hepatic impairment (NCI Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group criteria AST > ULN with total bilirubin ≤ ULN or any AST level with total bilirubin > 
1.0-1.5 × ULN). 
No formal studies have been performed with rucaparib in patients with hepatic impairment. Entry criteria for 
rucaparib clinical studies excluded patients with significant hepatic impairment.  
Rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with moderate (defined as any ALT/AST level and total bilirubin > 
1.5-3 × ULN) or severe hepatic impairment (defined as any ALT/AST level and total bilirubin > 3 × ULN). 
There were no notable differences between patients with or without hepatic impairment, or among the 
subgroups in each category (ie, BRCA mutant ovarian cancer, all ovarian cancer, and overall populations). A 
treatment-related TEAE was reported in 91.3% of patients with hepatic impairment and in 95.3% of patients 
without hepatic impairment. An SAE was reported in 39.1% of patients with hepatic impairment and in 28.4% 
of patients without hepatic impairment, with a treatment-related SAE reported in 8.7% of patients with hepatic 
impairment and in 9.6% of patients without hepatic impairment. There was no discernible difference in 
occurrence of TEAEs of Grade ≥ 3 (63.0% of patients with hepatic impairment; 62.5% of patients without 
hepatic impairment). 
TEAEs that led to treatment interruption and/or dose reduction occurred at a lower rate in patients with hepatic 
impairment than in patients without hepatic impairment (54.3% versus 65.3%, respectively). TEAEs led to 
discontinuation of rucaparib in 23.9% of patients with hepatic impairment and in 18.2% of patients without 
hepatic impairment, with a treatment-related TEAE leading to discontinuation of rucaparib in 6.5% of patients 
with hepatic impairment as compared to 8.3% of patients without hepatic impairment. A TEAE with an outcome 
of death was reported in 4 patients (8.7%) with hepatic impairment and in 10 patients (2.8%) without hepatic 
impairment; no TEAE that led to death was considered related to rucaparib. 
More patients with normal hepatic function at baseline than patients with hepatic impairment at baseline had a 
shift from normal or Grade 1 ALT at baseline to Grade 3/4 increased ALT (12.7% versus 6.5%), and fewer 
patients with normal hepatic function at baseline than patients with hepatic impairment at baseline had a shift 
from normal or Grade 1 bilirubin at baseline to Grade 3/4 increased bilirubin (1.7% versus 6.5%). There were 
no similar differences noted for other clinical chemistry parameters, including increased AST. 
In addition, no difference in the safety profile of rucaparib has been observed in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment. Taken together, these data suggest that no dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment. Rucaparib should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (SmPC Section 4.2). 
Looking at the ‘all ovarian cancer’ population, there were no discernible differences between those with mild 
hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function with regards to the summary of TEAEs, except more TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation (28.1% vs. 17.7%). There were no notable differences in the shifts in CTCAE grade 
that would indicate that patients with hepatic impairment at baseline had more laboratory abnormalities while 
receiving treatment with rucaparib. More patients with normal baseline hepatic function than patients with 
baseline hepatic impairment had a shift from normal or Grade 1 ALT at baseline to Grade 3/4 increased ALT 
(12.7% versus 6.5%). Fewer patients with normal baseline hepatic function than patients with baseline hepatic 
impairment had a shift from normal or Grade 1 bilirubin at baseline to Grade 3/4 increased bilirubin (1.7% 
versus 6.5%).

Paediatric Population 
Paediatric patients were not included in clinical studies with rucaparib. All studies to date have required that 
patients are ≥ 18 years of age. Therefore, the safety of rucaparib in paediatric patients has not been established. 
In addition, there have been no nonclinical studies specifically performed in juvenile animals. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Region 
There were no notable differences in the safety profile (including TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs 
of Grade ≥ 3, and TEAEs leading to rucaparib discontinuation, dose reduction or treatment interruption) of 
patients (N = 123) treated at investigational sites in the European Union (EU) as compared to patients (N = 286) 
treated at investigational sites in other regions. 
Drug Interactions 
Drug interaction data are discussed in Section 2.4.3. Pharmacology. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Patients who were lactating or pregnant were excluded from the clinical studies with rucaparib. 
Based on the mechanism of action and nonclinical studies, rucaparib has the potential to cause foetal harm when 
administered to pregnant women. 
There are no animal studies on the excretion of rucaparib in breast milk. It is unknown whether rucaparib or its 
metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Rucaparib must not be 
used during breast-feeding. 
Patients should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with rucaparib and for 6 months after 
the final dose.  
Photosensitivity 
Photosensitivity was initially reported in the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of Study CO-338-010 (Part 1, 
10.7%). Based on the reports of photosensitivity in the early portion of this study, guidance for sun protection 
was included in subsequent portions of Study CO-338-010 as well as in all other Phase 2 and Phase 3 protocols 
evaluating rucaparib. 
A total of 43 patients (10.5%) in the overall safety population and 15 patients (10.5%) with BRCA mutant 
ovarian cancer experienced photosensitivity. None of the events of photosensitivity were of Grade ≥ 3 severity.

Overdose 
One patient in Part 2 of Study CO-338-017 received 900 mg BID rucaparib for 9 consecutive days (planned dose 
was 600 mg BID) as of the visit cut-off date. Adverse events (AEs) observed in this patient were consistent with 
those observed to date with rucaparib.  
There is no known antidote for overdoses of rucaparib. In the event of suspected overdose, the patient should 
be monitored with appropriate haematology and clinical chemistry and should receive supportive therapy, as 
necessary. 
Drug Abuse 
Given the pharmacological class of rucaparib and the absence of psychotropic effects, there is no expected 
potential for drug abuse. 
Based on in vitro transporter studies, rucaparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and there was minimal 
penetration of rucaparib-derived radioactivity through the blood-brain barrier in a [14C]rucaparib tissue 
distribution study in the rat. 
Thus, it is unlikely that rucaparib exposures in the CNS would be sufficient to translate to any effects in patients. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
There have been no reports of withdrawal or rebound with short-term or long-term use of rucaparib. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with rucaparib. However, 
caution is advised in patients who report fatigue, nausea, or dizziness during treatment with rucaparib. 
Neurobehavioral assessments were incorporated in the GLP 28-day repeat-dose toxicity studies for rucaparib in 
rats. There were no neurobehavioral findings except slightly lower hind limb grip strength at the highest dose 
evaluated.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment 
TEAEs that led to discontinuation of rucaparib reported in ≥ 2 patients in any subgroup are summarized in Table 
35.  
Overall, 77 (18.8%) patients discontinued rucaparib due to TEAEs, most frequently due to malignant neoplasm 
progression (22 patients, 5.4%) and combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (10 patients, 2.4%). There were no 
notable differences among the different subgroups. Median times to discontinuation due to a TEAE were 105 
days for patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer and 64 days for patients with non-BRCA ovarian cancer. 
Median time to discontinuation was shorter for patients with other tumours (34 days), although this number was 
derived from only 7 patients.

Treatment-related TEAEs that led to discontinuation of rucaparib reported in ≥ 2 patients in any subgroup are 
presented in Table 36. The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs that led to discontinuation of rucaparib was low 
(33 patients, 8.1% overall) and included combined asthenia/fatigue (10 patients, 2.4%), nausea (5 patients, 
1.2%), combined thrombocytopenia and/or low/ decreased platelets (5 patients, 1.2%), anaemia (4 patients, 
1.0%), dyspnoea (2 patients, 0.5%), diarrhoea (2 patients, 0.5%) and vomiting (2 patients, 0.5%). All other 
treatment-related TEAEs that led to discontinuation were experienced by 1 patient (0.2%).

Subgroup: Safety Population (Combined Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-017, and CO 338-023) 
Updated data 
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent TEAEs leading to rucaparib discontinuation (7.1% to 9.4 %) 
across  all  populations.  Malignant  neoplasm  progression  was  the  most  common  TEAE  leading  to  rucaparib 
discontinuation in 6.6% of patients in the efficacy population, 6.3% of patients with BRCAmut OC in the safety 
population, 4.0% of OC patients, and 4.4% in the overall safety population. No TEAEs of malignant neoplasm 
progression leading to rucaparib discontinuation were treatment-related. 
Adverse Events leading to dose reduction or interruption 
Events leading to dose modifications that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in any subgroup are summarized in Table 
37. The low rate of treatment discontinuation due to treatment-related TEAEs (less than 10% in any subgroup, 
Table 36), indicates that the dose modification recommendations were effective in allowing patients to continue 
rucaparib treatment. 
In ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, 71.3% experienced a TEAE leading to dose reduction or 
interruption; 50.3% of patients experienced a TEAE leading to dose reduction and 60.8% of patients 
experienced a TEAE leading to treatment interruption. The most frequent TEAEs (≥ 5% of patients) that led to 
dose reduction or treatment interruption in ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation were combined terms

of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (29.4%), asthenia/fatigue (24.5%), nausea (18.9%), 
thrombocytopenia and/or low/decreased platelets (12.6%), vomiting (12.6%), combined terms of ALT/AST 
increased (10.5%), and combined terms of neutropenia/ANC decreased (10.5%). 
Asthenia/fatigue and vomiting and nausea led to treatment interruption or dose reduction in patients with other 
tumours less frequently (3.1%) compared to ovarian cancer patients (20.7%), likely due to the longer 
treatment duration for the latter group. The frequencies for other PTs were comparable. 
The median time to a TEAE that led to dose reduction or treatment interruption of rucaparib was comparable 
between patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer and all ovarian cancer patients (25.5 and 23.0 days, 
respectively).

In ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, 61.5% experienced treatment-related TEAEs that led to 
rucaparib dose reduction or treatment interruption; 48.3% of patients experienced treatment-related TEAEs 
that led to dose reduction and 48.3% of patients experienced treatment-related TEAEs that led to treatment 
interruption. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs that led to rucaparib dose reduction or 
treatment interruption were combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (29.4%), 
combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (23.1%), nausea (16.8%), combined terms of 
thrombocytopenia/decreased platelets (12.6%), combined terms of neutropenia/decreased ANC (10.5%), 
combined terms of ALT/AST increased (9.8%), and vomiting (8.4%). 
Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3) 
Results from the ARIEL3 trial were presented within the D180 response package. The results of Study 
CO-338-014 confirmed that the safety profile of rucaparib is similar in ovarian cancer patients treated with 
rucaparib in either the treatment or maintenance setting. 
In the treatment setting, the most common TEAEs were combined asthenia/fatigue, nausea, combined anaemia 
and/or low/decreased haemoglobin, combined ALT/AST increased, diarrhoea, vomiting, and decreased 
appetite. Commonly experienced Grade 3 or higher TEAEs included combined anaemia and/or low/decreased 
haemoglobin, combined ALT/AST increased, and combined asthenia/fatigue. The most common SAEs and TEAEs 
leading to death or study drug discontinuation were from malignant neoplasm progression. 
In the maintenance setting, rucaparib demonstrated a manageable side-effect profile. In the safety population 
of 561 patients who initiated treatment with either 600 mg twice daily (BID) of rucaparib or matched placebo 
(rucaparib, n = 372; placebo, n = 189). Comparable to the treatment setting, the most common TEAEs 
occurring in the rucaparib group were nausea, combined asthenia/fatigue, dysgeusia, combined anaemia/low or 
decreased haemoglobin, constipation and vomiting, combined ALT/AST increased and diarrhoea. The most 
common Grade 3 or higher TEAEs in patients treated with rucaparib relative to placebo were combined anaemia 
and/or low/decreased haemoglobin and combined ALT/AST increased. Of note, the latter were not associated 
with drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

In CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), currently ongoing, TEAEs with an outcome of death occurred in 6 patients treated with 
rucaparib; of these, 2 events (1 of AML, 1 of MDS) were assessed as related to rucaparib. For placebo, 2 patients 
experienced a TEAE with an outcome of death; neither of these events were related to treatment. Other serious 
TEAEs occurred in 21.0% of rucaparib-treated patients and 10.6% of placebo-treated patients; 4.3% of patients 
in the rucaparib group had a serious event of combined anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin compared 
to 1 patient (0.5%) in the placebo group. 
A total of 54.6% patients in the rucaparib group had a TEAE that led to a dose reduction compared with 4.2% in 
the placebo group. Similarly, a greater incidence of patients in the rucaparib treatment arm had a TEAE that led 
to a treatment interruption (63.7% rucaparib; 10.1% placebo). The treatment discontinuation rate for TEAEs 
was 14.2% for rucaparib treated patients and 2.6% for the placebo group. Discontinuation of rucaparib was 
primarily due to events of combined anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (3.0%), combined 
thrombocytopenia and/or low/decreased platelets (2.7%), and nausea (2.4%). 
Across the clinical development program for oral rucaparib, the rate of treatment-emergent (ie, occurring while 
on treatment or within 28 days after the last dose) MDS/AML was 0.5% (5 cases/~1.077). The rate of all 
MDS/AML events including those occurring more than 28 days after the last dose was 0.9% (10/~1.077). 
Post marketing experience 
Starting in January 2017, following the approval of rucaparib (Rubraca®) in the United States, the Clovis Safety 
Committee holds monthly meetings to review and evaluate the rucaparib postmarketing (PM) data, as a routine 
safety surveillance practice. The committee reviews AE line listings, which are quality controlled and medically 
reviewed, to determine if potential signals or safety concerns exist.  
For the period of January 2017 to April 2017, there were no safety signals detected from the PM setting. There 
was a noted increase in the number of reports of headache, dyspepsia, and stomatitis with a temporal 
association to rucaparib; however, all of these events had plausible alternative causes. The committee 
considered and evaluated these events, concluding that they do not represent new safety risks, at present, due 
to significant confounding factors and limited clinical information. Monitoring and reviews of these events will 
continue.  
As of 10 April 2017, there were 1,066 AEs, in total, reported from PM sources. Of these, there were 152 SAEs, 
of which 97 SAEs were unexpected per the United States Prescribing Information for Rubraca®. There were 520 
unexpected events reported overall, of which 423 events were not serious. 
The SOC with the highest number of events (319) was Gastrointestinal disorders; 15 events in this SOC were 
unexpected SAEs. The SOCs with the next most frequently reported unexpected SAEs were General disorders 
and Administration site conditions (14), Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) 
(11), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (9), Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (6), Surgical and 
medical procedures (6), Investigations (5), Infections and infestations (5), Hepatobiliary disorders (4), 
Psychiatric disorders (4), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3), Nervous system disorders (3), 
Vascular disorders (3), Blood and lymphatic system disorders (2),and Injury, poisoning, and procedural 
complications (2). The following SOCs each had one unexpected SAE: Cardiac disorders, Endocrine disorders, 
Renal and urinary disorders, and Social circumstances.  
The most frequently reported unexpected SAEs in the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders were gastrointestinal 
obstruction events, which included intestinal obstruction (4), small intestinal obstruction (4), and large 
Assessment report

intestinal obstruction (1). Other unexpected SAEs reported in this SOC included ascites (2), abdominal 
discomfort (1), abdominal distension (1), flatulence (1), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (1).  
The most frequently reported unexpected SAEs in the SOC of General disorders and administration site 
conditions were deaths (5). Information regarding the circumstances of these cases of death were minimal or 
not reported. Also reported under the SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions were 2 events 
of Terminal state (1 event led to death, but the patient was reported as “on the brink of death” prior to starting 
Rubraca® as a last effort to save her life) and 2 events of Disease progression (1 event led to death).  
The most frequently reported unexpected SAEs in the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (incl 
cysts and polyps) were malignant neoplasm progression (8 events, one of which was fatal). Single SAEs of colon 
cancer, malignant pleural effusion, and metastases to the peritoneum were also reported in this SOC. As of the 
10 April 2017 data cut-off, there were no spontaneous reports of MDS or AML.  
As of 10 April 2017, there were 26 non-serious reports of off-label use received into the safety database. Of the 
13 medically confirmed cases, the indications included peritoneal cancer (with and without/ unknown BRCA 
mutation) (6), BRCA negative ovarian cancer (1), cancer of the parametrium (1), BRCA somatic mutation of 
vulvar cancer (1), and FTC (2). Twelve of these cases were associated with SAEs, however, none were fatal or 
life-threatening, and they were all consistent with rucaparib safety profile. Hence, these off-label use cases have 
not raised safety concern at present.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data set is based on patients from 3 open label studies (Study CO-338-010, Study CO-338-017 
[ARIEL2], and Study CO-338-023 [RUCAPANC]) treated with rucaparib 600 mg BID until disease progression or 
other reason for discontinuation and is currently small (409 patients overall, 377 with ovarian cancer and 143 
with claimed indication of BRCA mutation ovarian cancer) and the possibility of detecting uncommon and rare 
AEs is limited. An update of safety data was presented and results for 106 subjects that comprise the primary 
efficacy population together with a summary of post-marketing AE reports. Although the number of patients in 
current studies are too low to allow precision in the assessment of differences between the “BRCAm” and the 
“not BRCAm” patients and differences between the “sBRCAm” and the “gBRCAm” patients, safety analyses were 
carried out in these subpopulations. 
According to the initial submission of safety data, the median duration of treatment in patients with BRCA 
mutant ovarian cancer was 7.5 months. Approximately 25% of patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer 
received > 12 months of treatment, and 69.2% of patients received > 6 months of treatment. About 10.6% of 
patients in the BRCA mutant ovarian cancer discontinued treatment due to AEs and 79.8% of patients due to 
progressive disease. 
All patients reported TEAEs, the majority (~95%) considered treatment related. Nearly one-third of patients 
reported a serious TEAE, just fewer than 10% were deemed treatment related. The summary TEAE profile in 
patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer was similar to the total safety population, as well as the ovarian 
cancer population. 
Nausea, vomiting, fatigue (including asthenia), anaemia, decreased neutrophils (neutropenia), decreased 
lymphocytes (lymphopenia), decreased platelets (thrombocytopenia), diarrhoea, abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, decreased appetite, headache, dizziness, dysgeusia, increased blood creatinine, dyspnoea, urinary 
tract infection and increased ALT/AST are adverse drug reactions observed with rucaparib treatment. The 
events are generally low grade and manageable without requiring discontinuation of rucaparib treatment.

Page 149/167 
  
  
BRCA mutant ovarian cancer:  
The TEAE profile was similar to that of the total safety population as well as the ovarian cancer population: all 
patients experienced TEAEs, 97.9% of whom experienced TEAEs that were considered treatment-related. SAEs 
were reported for 31.5% of patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer, with the incidence of treatment-related 
SAEs at 8.4%. In total, 65.7% of patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer experienced TEAEs of Grade 3 or 
higher. TEAEs led to treatment interruption and/or reduction in 71.3% of patients (treatment interruption = 
60.8%, dose reduction = 50.3%). TEAEs led to discontinuation of rucaparib in 18.9% of patients with BRCA 
mutant ovarian cancer; treatment-related TEAEs led to discontinuation in 5.6% of patients. TEAEs with an 
outcome of death were reported in 3.5% of patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer; none of these was 
considered related to treatment. 
There were no notable differences in the proportions of patients with a gBRCA mutation (N = 108), sBRCA 
mutation (N = 23), unknown germline/somatic BRCA status (N = 12), or those without a BRCA mutation 
(non-BRCA; N = 234) who experienced TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, or SAEs; however, due to the low 
number of patients with a sBRCA mutation or unknown germline/somatic BRCA status, comparisons involving 
these groups should be interpreted cautiously. A greater proportion of patients with a gBRCA mutation 
experienced TEAEs (regardless of causality) of Grade ≥3 as compared to non-BRCA patients (gBRCA mutation 
= 68.5%; non-BRCA = 59.0%) or a TEAE (regardless of causality) that led to rucaparib discontinuation, dose 
reduction, or treatment interruption (gBRCA mutation = 79.6%; non-BRCA = 65.0%); however, the frequencies 
of treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 were comparable between gBRCA (50.9%) and non-BRCA patients 
(45.7%), as were those of treatment-related TEAEs leading to rucaparib discontinuation, dose reduction, or 
treatment interruption (gBRCA = 65.7%; non-BRCA = 57.3%). While there was a difference in the frequency of 
ALT/AST elevation and anaemia AEs reported in ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation versus in ovarian 
cancer patients without a BRCA mutation, there were no significant differences in the observed laboratory shifts 
for ALT/AST or haemoglobin in the subgroups.  
The most common TEAEs, reported were consistent with those observed within the total ovarian cancer 
population and the overall population, and irrespective of relationship to rucaparib, were combined 
fatigue/asthenia (79.7%), nausea (76.9%), combined anaemia/decreased haemoglobin (54.5%), vomiting 
(50.3%), combined ALT/AST increased (47.6%), constipation (41.3%), and dysgeusia (39.2%). The most 
frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (71.3%), nausea 
(65.7%), combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (51.7%), combined terms of ALT/AST 
increased (45.5%), and dysgeusia (37.1%). 
The overall incidence of Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, regardless of causality, was 65.7% and were combined terms of 
anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (29.4%), combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (14.0%), combined 
terms of ALT/AST increased (12.6%), combined terms of neutropenia and/or low/decreased ANC (10.5%), 
malignant neoplasm progression (9.1%), and vomiting (5.6%).  
Treatment-related Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were experienced by 49.7% of patients. The most commonly reported were 
combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (28.7%), combined terms of ALT/AST increased 
(11.9%), combined terms of asthenia/fatigue (10.5%), and combined terms of neutropenia and/or 
low/decreased ANC (10.5%).  
SAEs: malignant neoplasm progression (8.4%) and anaemia (5.6%) were also the most frequently reported 
SAEs. There were no notable differences in the frequency of SAEs between the overall patient population 
(29.6%) and patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer (31.5%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 150/167 
  
  
Treatment-related SAEs were experienced by 9.5% of ovarian cancer patients and 8.4% of ovarian cancer 
patients with a BRCA mutation, with the most common treatment-related SAE being anaemia (in 4.5% and 
5.6% of patients, respectively). 
The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation of rucaparib was 5.6% in patients with 
BRCA mutant ovarian cancer and included nausea (2.1%), fatigue, anaemia and vomiting (0.7% each). 
Relatively few patients discontinued treatment due to a TEAE; the most common reason was gastrointestinal 
(GI) disorders (6.1%). Treatment-related TEAE discontinuations were lower (8.1%). Discontinuations tended to 
occur later, at a median of 85 days in the all ovarian cancer population and 105 days in the ovarian BRCA group. 
Treatment-related TEAEs that led to rucaparib dose reduction or treatment interruption were 61.5% in ovarian 
cancer patients with a BRCA mutation; 48.3% led to dose reduction and 48.3% led to treatment interruption. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs that led to rucaparib dose reduction or treatment 
interruption were combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin (29.4%), combined terms of 
asthenia/fatigue (23.1%), nausea (16.8%), combined terms of thrombocytopenia/decreased platelets 
(12.6%), combined terms of neutropenia/decreased ANC (10.5%), combined terms of ALT/AST increased 
(9.8%), and vomiting (8.4%). 
Updated safety analyses with a longer follow-up (data cut-off of 10 April 2017) were submitted as part of the 
D120 responses. Overall, the rates of TEAEs, SAEs, Grade 3 and higher TEAEs, and TEAEs with an outcome of 
death were comparable between the patients with BRCAmut OC in the primary efficacy and safety populations, 
all OC patients, and patients in the overall safety population. 
Some  TEAEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in  patients  with  BRCAmut  OC,  but  the  duration  of  rucaparib 
treatment was generally longer in these patients than in the OC and overall safety populations and is the likely 
cause of some higher TEAE rates in this population.  
AESIs: 10 cases of MDS/ AML, as of 10 April 2017, and including all studies in the rucaparib clinical development 
program (1077 patients exposed to rucaparib). In the group of patients receiving rucaparib, five cases of 
MDS/AML occurred while patient was on treatment with rucaparib or within the 28-day safety follow-up period 
after treatment discontinuation and five cases occurred more than 28 days after rucaparib treatment 
discontinuation. Although no firm conclusion on causal relationship can be established between rucaparib 
treatment and the development of AML/MDS because of the presence of potential confounding factors such as 
prior chemotherapy in some patients, a deleterious BRCA mutation that may predispose patients to develop 
further malignancies and in addition the confounding effect of time course between end of rucaparib treatment 
and development of MDS/AML. MDS/ AML is listed as an important potential risk of Rubraca treatment, to be 
followed up in the RMP. 
Clinical Chemistry: Notable shifts from baseline were observed for creatinine, ALT, AST, and cholesterol 
concentrations in the majority of patients. There were no notable differences in clinical chemistry laboratory 
abnormalities among the tumour subgroups, apart from ‘other tumours’ for AST, ALT and cholesterol.  
In all BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, an increase in ALT or AST from baseline to a worsening CTCAE grade 
occurred in 74.8% and 70.6% of patients, respectively. A shift to CTCAE Grade 3 or greater ALT or AST was 
observed in 13.3% and 2.8% of BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, respectively. The ALT/AST elevations 
occurred early in treatment.  
One patient with relapsed ovarian cancer of the 409 patients was observed to have ALT/AST > 3 × ULN and 
bilirubin levels > 2 × ULN without evidence of cholestasis after 2 weeks of treatment with rucaparib. The role of 
rucaparib in the hepatic toxicity cannot be excluded. No Hy’s Law cases have been recorded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 151/167 
  
  
In BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, an increase in serum creatinine from baseline to a worsening CTCAE 
grade occurred in 88.1% of patients (64.3% to Grade 1, 23.1% to Grade 2, and 0.7% to Grade 4; no patient had 
a shift to Grade 3). The elevations were thus frequent and observed early in treatment. Serum creatinine levels 
decreased with interruption or discontinuation of rucaparib, and increase again with resumption of treatment. 
The clinical significance of creatinine increases is unknown for the applicant as for the time being no clinical 
sequalae have been observed.  
Increase to CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 total cholesterol occurred in 2.2%, 2.4%, and 4.2% of all patients, all ovarian 
cancer patients, and BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients, respectively. The Grade 3 events observed were 
successfully managed by treatment modification and/or concomitant treatment. The clinical significance of 
cholesterol increases is unknown. 
There was a higher frequency of anaemia, neutropenia and elevated ALT/AST in the BRCA mutant population; 
the haematology abnormalities were apparent after adjusting for time on treatment. However, this increase in 
the BRCA mutant OC population was not evident when the laboratory results rather than TEAEs were compared. 
Safety population which included 175 patients with a BRCA mutation and 234 patients without BRCA mutation:  
Slight increases were observed in the incidence of some TEAEs in the gBRCA patient subpopulation. Although 
these differences are likely due to the longer duration of treatment, the median duration of exposure in both 
sBRCA and gBRCA were 222.5 days and 237.5 days respectively, which is considered similar. The time-adjusted 
event frequencies are generally higher in gBRCA patients compared with the s-BRCA group, nevertheless, it is 
agreed that the very limited number of patients with sBRCA mutations (n = 28) prevents from drawing firm 
conclusions.  
An apparent increase was observed in some laboratory measurements. ALT/AST, thrombocytopenia, and 
anaemia were greater in the gBRCA versus the sBRCA and non-BRCA subgroups. The applicant argues that 
these differences were minimal when using the more objective measurement of relevant supporting laboratory 
parameters which is supported.  
Elevated transaminases were an early event, occurring within Cycle 1. Haematological abnormalities tended to 
manifest later (Cycle 3 and beyond). Other common laboratory abnormalities included increased creatinine and 
increased cholesterol, the former attributed to transporter inhibition, the latter of uncertain aetiology.  
Prolongation of QT and cardiac toxicity: One patient with a history of previous episodes of prolonged QTc and a 
provisional diagnosis of a congenital prolonged QT syndrome made before study entry experienced Grade 4 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia approximately 3 weeks after initiating rucaparib.  
Risk of QT prolongation cannot be ruled out since at 600 mg BID, the recommended dose, the mean values for 
change of QTcF in Cycle 1 ranged from 5.0 to 14.0 msec, which is higher than 5 ms established in the Guidance 
E14 for evaluation of QT/QTc. 5 cases of cardiac or related events potentially associated with QT prolongation (1 
patient with SAE of grade 4 arrhythmia, 2 patients with SAE of cardiac arrest, and 2 patients with SAE of 
syncope) were identified in patients (n = 1077) that have been exposed to oral rucaparib in Clovis-sponsored 
studies as of 10 April 2017. No ECG information was available for the 4 patients with cardiac arrest or syncope. 
Information about QT prolongation is included in section 5.1. of the SmPC and additionally QTc prolongation is 
listed as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Skin toxicity associated with rucaparib (i.e. photosensitivity) is a concern. A total of 43 patients (10.5%) in the 
overall safety population and 15 patients (10.5%) with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer experienced 
photosensitivity. None of the events of photosensitivity was of Grade 3 or higher severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 152/167 
  
  
Information on photosensitivity has been included in section 4.4 of SmPC. The effect of rucaparib on 
Photosensitivity is considered as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
No direct causal relationship can be established between rucaparib treatment and the risk of secondary cancer 
as a result of long-term DNA-repair inhibition. Given this risk, however, the effect of rucaparib on New Primary 
Malignancy is considered as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Hepatic and renal impairment: The safety and effectiveness of rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic and severe renal impairment and a PK study specifically in patients with hepatic and 
renal impairment has not been conducted. This has been reflected in the SmPC and RMP. No dose adjustment to 
the recommended starting dose is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment and mild or moderate renal 
impairment. 
CTCAE ≥grade 3 events, SAEs and adverse events leading to dose interruptions and/or reductions were reported 
more frequently in patients with mild or moderate renal compared with normal renal function. Rucaparib should 
not be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment because the safety profile of rucaparib has not 
been evaluated in those patients.  
Paediatric patients (< 18 years old) were not included in clinical studies with rucaparib. Therefore, the safety of 
rucaparib in paediatric patients has not been established, nor has it been considered appropriate to conduct 
nonclinical studies specifically in juvenile animals. 
Age: No dose adjustment to the recommended starting dose is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) 
in the SmPC.  
Although there is limited clinical data in patients over 75 years, it is considered that there is an indication of 
higher frequency of several TEAE patients who are ≥65 years of age (Sections 4.2). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Relevant information is currently presented in the SmPC. Warnings and precautions sections cover the most 
relevant information regarding haematological toxicity, AML/MDS, photosensitivity and GI toxicity. 
Additional studies are expected to provide further information regarding effects of rucaparib on QT interval, as 
for the time being the risk of QT prolongation cannot be ruled out, and in patients with hepatic impairment (see 
RMP). 
The safety has been considered sufficiently characterised in the context of a conditional MA. Additional data from 
confirmatory studies will be provided in support of the overall safety profile of rucaparib.

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.4, dated 20 March 2018, is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of rucaparib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers rucaparib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 157/167 
  
  
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rubraca (rucaparib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, that was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is also approved as a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 
14(7)].  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The revised applied indication for Rubraca is as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum 
sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum 
based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide and the leading cause of death 
attributed to gynecological cancer. After initial therapy, most women will have a PFI following their frontline 
platinum regimen of approximately 1.5 to 2 years, depending on the extent of post-operative residual disease 
and response to chemotherapy. Relapse still occurs, however, in the majority of cases, and only 10% to 30% of 
women experience long-term survival. Advanced stage disease is associated with a 5-year survival rate of only 
30% to 40%. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with platinum-sensitive disease are typically retreated with platinum-based therapy until they no longer 
respond to or can no longer tolerate such treatment. If they cannot tolerate platinum due to toxicity or 
hypersensitivity then trabectedin with liposomal doxorubicin is an approved available option associated with 
high activity. 
Clinical efficacy data come from a pooled analysis of patients enrolled in two uncontrolled Phase 2 open-label 
studies. The primary efficacy population comprises 106 ovarian cancer patients harboring a deleterious BRCA 
mutation who received 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy. The platinum-sensitive population was 79 
patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The investigator-assessed RECIST ORR in platinum-sensitive patients was 64.6% (n=51) [95% CI, 
53.0%-75.0%, N = 79], 35.0% [95% CI, 15.4%-59.2%, N = 20]. The proportion of patients with complete

response was 10.1%. Median DOR was 294 days (224-393 days) (9.7 months) and median PFS was of 332 days 
(10.9 months). Median overall survival was not reached. The ORR was 65.2% and 61.5% for gBRCA and sBRCA 
respectively. 
The activity shown in terms of ORR and DOR is considered high and convincing enough to rule out a significant 
detriment compared to trabectedin+pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (this is expected to be confirmed 
post-approval from ARIEL4). The high ORR associated with rucaparib in a more extensively pre-treated 
population compared to T+PLD historical control indicates a potential advantage for some patients (see further 
discussion in 3.7.3). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is no clinical evidence of the potential benefit of retreating patients with PARPi. No patient in rucaparib 
clinical trials had received previous treatment with a PARPi that had demonstrated clinical activity up to date. 
This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Although the durable response in a high proportion of patients is considered a benefit, and the data observed for 
time-related endpoints are reassuring that the efficacy is adequate compared to available treatment options, 
there is a need to further quantify the efficacy of Rubraca in the therapeutic context of the approved indication 
in terms of time-related outcomes in a comparative trial (Annex II). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs with rucaparib (occurring in >20%) were: nausea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, anaemia 
and/or low/decreased haemoglobin, ALT/AST increased, constipation, decreased appetite and dysgeusia. The 
most frequent AEs with rucaparib are in accordance with the AEs observed for other PARP inhibitors. The AEs 
have been frequently reported with higher rates in patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer compared to 
patients with other tumours. 
In general, the safety profile of rucaparib in the ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation includes adverse 
events in the MedDRA SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders, haematotoxicity, General Disorders and Administration 
Site Conditions, Investigations and Nervous System Disorders. The most common TEAEs, irrespective of 
relationship to rucaparib, were combined fatigue/asthenia, nausea, combined anaemia/decreased haemoglobin, 
vomiting, combined ALT/AST increased, constipation, and dysgeusia, and were generally consistent with those 
observed within the total ovarian cancer population and the overall safety population.  
The most common Grade ≥ 3 TEAE by PT were combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased haemoglobin, 
combined terms of asthenia/fatigue, combined terms of ALT/AST increased, combined terms of neutropenia 
and/or low/decreased, malignant neoplasm progression, and vomiting. 
In ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs that led 
to rucaparib dose reduction or treatment interruption were combined terms of anaemia and/or low/decreased 
haemoglobin, combined terms of asthenia/fatigue, nausea, combined terms of thrombocytopenia/decreased 
platelets, combined terms of neutropenia/decreased ANC, combined terms of ALT/AST increased, and vomiting.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Risk of QT prolongation cannot be ruled out (see SmPC). Future studies are expected to provide additional 
information (see RMP). 
The safety of rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and 
severe renal impairment (see SmPC). Studies are expected to provide additional information regarding effects 
of rucaparib on hepatic impairment. Additional data from future studies will be provided in support of this (see 
RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most up-to-date results confirm that the overall outcomes are mainly dominated by the platinum-sensitive 
subgroup. 
In a population with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer previously treated with at least two therapies, a durable 
response rate of almost 65% is considered clinically meaningful. Considering that barely 30% of women in this 
population experience long term survival, the available efficacy results seem promising. 
Efficacy has been established on the basis of durable ORR. The magnitude of this effect is such that it can be 
assumed that this will result in a favourable effect on long-term outcomes such as PFS and OS. Although the 
durable response in a high proportion of patients is considered a benefit, and the data observed for time-related 
endpoints are reassuring that the efficacy is adequate compared to available treatment options, there is a need 
to further quantify the efficacy of Rubraca in the therapeutic context of the approved indication in terms of 
time-related outcomes in a comparative trial.  
Although more frequent, other AEs, like anaemia, vomiting, nausea are generally of low grade and could be 
manageable with specific therapy.  
The safety profile of rucaparib monotherapy appears sufficiently characterised. Additional data from future 
studies are expected to be provided in support of the overall safety.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A durable ORR of 53%-65% along with PFS results in the platinum-sensitive setting could be considered of 
compelling clinical relevance in light of current alternatives and this could serve as basis for a CMA taking into 
account the recognised unmet medical need in a population unable to tolerate further platinum. The efficacy 
results in this population as compared to the sufficiently characterised safety profile support a positive 
benefit-risk balance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 161/167 
  
  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by 
the applicant in the initial submission.  
Rubraca is intended to treat patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more 
prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy. Advanced stage disease is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 
only 30% to 40%, which along with the fact that these patients have received at least two or more prior lines of 
platinum-based chemotherapy, pose a dismal prognosis to these patients. Therefore, the product is considered 
to belong within the category of “aimed at treating, preventing or diagnosing seriously debilitating or 
life-threatening diseases”. 
The initial applied indication was restricted to the platinum-sensitive population where there are limited 
efficacious and tolerable treatment options.  
Conditional marketing authorisations may be granted if the CHMP finds that all the following requirements are 
met: 
1.  the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive; 
The results in the platinum-sensitive population and comparative literature review support a positive 
benefit-risk balance. 
2.  It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data; 
Efficacy has been established on the basis of durable ORR. The magnitude of this effect is such that it can be 
assumed that this will result in a favourable effect on long-term outcomes such as PFS and OS. Although the 
durable response in a high proportion of patients is considered a benefit, and the data observed for time-related 
endpoints are reassuring that the efficacy is adequate compared to available treatment options, there is a need 
to further quantify the efficacy of Rubraca in the therapeutic context of the approved indication in terms of 
time-related outcomes in a comparative trial. The ARIEL4 study (confirmatory trial, study CO-338-043), is a 
Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, randomized study evaluating rucaparib versus chemotherapy for treatment of 
relapsed BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer. The study is being conducted in the US, Europe, and other regions and 
planned to enrol approximately 345 patients. Patient randomisation is 2:1 to receive rucaparib or 
chemotherapy, therefore approximately 230 patients were expected to be treated with rucaparib. 
The CO-338-043 study design was revised based on CHMP feedback; specifically, to expand the treatment 
options for platinum-sensitive patients. Patients with platinum-resistant (patients who progressed ≥ 1 to < 6 
months after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy) or partially platinum-sensitive (patients who 
progressed ≥ 6 to < 12 months after last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy) disease will be randomized 2:1 
to receive rucaparib or weekly Paclitaxel. Patients with platinum-sensitive disease (patients who progressed ≥ 
12 months after last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy) will be randomized 2:1 to receive rucaparib or 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Full operational evaluation of the conduct of Study CO-338-043 has been assessed and the study was deemed 
to be feasible and fully enrolled by 2020. 
The Applicant was recommended to amend the Study CO-338-043 protocol to ensure that at least 270 partially 
platinum-sensitive patients are enrolled for confirmation of the EU proposed indication. As a result, study 
completion date is revised to be expected in Q2 2023. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 162/167 
  
  
Based on the above, the CHMP considered that ARIEL4 is likely to provide comprehensive data suitable to 
confirm the positive benefit-risk balance of Rubraca. 
3.  Unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; 
The proposed restricted population unable to tolerate further platinum therapy has limited efficacious treatment 
options, with more toxicity than PARPi. The only approved regimen considered to be associated with high activity 
is the combination of trabectedin+liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). However, this regimen is also associated with 
considerable toxicity and with certain complexities to its administration (use of central catheter, specific criteria 
required for treatment initiation, weekly monitoring of haematological parameters). 
If taking into account that rucaparib was studied in a later line setting it seems likely that even in a worst-case 
scenario, rucaparib efficacy findings could be comparable to those of trabectedin+PLD. 
From a safety point of view, rucaparib seems to offer a different safety profile than trabectedin+PLD, with 
important reductions in haematologic AEs and other relevant side effects. More specifically, the adverse 
reactions CTCAE Grade 3 or higher for anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 23%, 9% and 5% for 
rucaparib, as compared to 19%, 72% and 23% for the T+PLD respectively (see SmPCs).  
Rucaparib, as an orally administered drug, may also improve patient´s convenience compared to intravenous 
administered alternatives, with no risk of infusion reactions. 
It is acknowledged that there is an unmet need for more active and tolerable treatments capable of prolonging 
the life expectancy of patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, previously treated with at least two lines 
of platinum chemotherapy, who are unable to tolerate further platinum. This population has limited treatment 
options. Despite the availability of treatment options with possibly comparable efficacy, there remains an unmet 
medical need for these patients and the safety profile with lower frequencies of some important AEs, together 
with improvements such as ambulatory treatment, constitute a major therapeutic advantage. 
In conclusion, it is considered that that Rubraca introduces a major therapeutic advantage over authorised 
products. 
4.  The benefit to public health of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market outweighs 
the risks due to need for further data. 
Finally, regarding the possibility that the benefit of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market 
outweighs the risks due to need for further data, it can be concluded that the available data support a positive 
B/R for this population, and there are no PARPi currently authorised in BRCA mutant patients for the proposed 
indication. Thus, the benefit to public health of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market 
outweighs the risks, which are considered low, due to need for further data. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rubraca is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Rubraca is not similar to Yondelis and Zejula within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision that 
the risk-benefit balance of Rubraca is favourable in the following indication: 
Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or 
progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and 
who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2).

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018 
Page 164/167 
  
  
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional 
marketing authorisation   
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004,

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 22.03.2018  
Rubraca EMEA/H/C/004272 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Rubraca indicated as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with 
platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of 
platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Divergent opinion Rubraca: 
It is the opinion of the undersigned members: 
Based on the currently available data we consider the benefit-risk balance for rucaparib in the proposed 
restricted indication to remain undetermined. Major uncertainties exist regarding the quality of the data, as the 
current pivotal results for the rucaparib application are derived from a post-hoc analysis from pooled data from 
two single arm trials involving only 106 patients.  
Also replication of the results was not provided. In the absence of a head-to-head comparison to standard of 
care, there are large uncertainties on the robustness and validity of the results.  
As a consequence, the current results cannot be contextualised and any reliable estimation of effect size is 
prevented.  
Although the activity of the drug in terms of response rate is noted, the assumed better toxicity profile as 
compared to standard of care does not outweigh the major uncertainties regarding efficacy. 
In conclusion, we cannot conclude on a positive relative B/R and until more is known, the application is 
considered not approvable.

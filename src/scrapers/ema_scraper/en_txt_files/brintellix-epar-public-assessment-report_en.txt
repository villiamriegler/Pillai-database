2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Major  Depressive  Disorder  (MDD)  is  reported  to  be the  most  common  mood  disorder.  Depressive 
disorders tend to be chronic and both relapse and recurrence are seen frequently.  
A  worldwide  lifetime  prevalence  of  approximately  15%,  and  as  high  as  25%  in  women,  has  been 
reported for depression.  
In Europe, depression affects 13% of the population at some point in life and 6 to 8% in any one year. 
This  corresponds  to  more  than  20  million  women  and  men  of  working  age  in  Europe  suffering  each 
year from depression. Furthermore, the burden is expected to grow over the coming years. The World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  predicts  that  depression  will  become  the  single  most  important  illness  in 
Europe and worldwide by 2030. 
Depression is recurrent in 75 to 80% of patients, becomes chronic (that is, lasts 2 years or longer) in 
15 to 20% of depressed patients, and can lead to substantial impairments in an individual’s ability to 
take care of his/her everyday responsibilities. Furthermore, depression may lead to suicide; worldwide 
estimates indicate that approximately 60 to 70% of those who committed suicide had recently suffered 
from  (mostly  untreated)  depressive  episodes.  Therefore,  early  recognition  and  sufficient  treatment  of 
depression can save lives.  
Depression  is  associated  with  considerable  co-morbidity.  More  than  70%  of  patients  with  lifetime 
MDD  also  meet  the  criteria  for  at  least  one  other  DSM-IV  disorder;  for  example,  approximately  60% 
have  anxiety  disorders.  Furthermore,  more  than  half  of  the  patients  have  a  somatic  illness,  with  the 
most common being hypertension (30%) and diabetes mellitus (10%). Co-morbid depression impairs 
the quality of life and several aspects of functioning of patients with chronic diseases and aggravates 
the  course  of  their  mental  or  somatic  illness,  resulting  in  increased  health  care  utilisation  and  costs 
compared to non-depressed patients with chronic diseases.   
Depression poses an economic burden on the patients, on their families and friends, and on society. 
The ability of the depressed patients or their caregivers to work and make productive contributions to 
society  is  reduced,  whereas  the  utilisation  of  treatment  and  support  services  is  increased.  In  Europe, 
the  tangible  cost  of  depression  was  estimated  to  113  billion  euro  in  2011.  The  health-care  costs  for 
older  adults  with  depression,  who  have  typically  left  the  work  force,  are  approximately  50%  higher 
than those for older adults without depression. From the above, it is clear that depression is a major 
public  health  challenge,  both  with  respect  to  its  prevalence  and  the  severity  of  its  consequences  in 
terms of mortality, chronicity, co-morbidity, and disability, and with respect to the economic burden on 
society. 
Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria 
for  MDD.  The  presumed  mechanism  of  action  of  the  majority  of  antidepressants  is  thought  to  be  via 
inhibition of neuronal reuptake of monoamines (mainly serotonin and noradrenaline), with a resultant 
increase in monoamine neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Vortioxetine is claimed 
to bring a new concept into the antidepressant treatment area. The vortioxetine molecule is presented 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 8/159 
 
  
 
as  possessing  a  new  and  multimodal  pharmacological  mechanism  of  action.  In  vitro  studies  indicated 
that vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, a 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 
a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and an inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter. 
Data  from  serotonergic  receptor  and  transporter  occupancy  studies  coupled  with  neuronal  firing  and 
microdialysis  studies  in  rats  suggest  that  the  targets  interact  in  a  complex  fashion,  leading  to 
modulation  of  neurotransmission  in  several  systems,  including  the  serotonin,  norepinephrine, 
dopamine,  histamine,  and  acetylcholine  systems  within  the  rat  forebrain.  These  multimodal 
pharmacological actions are thought to be responsible for the antidepressant effects of vortioxetine. In 
addition,  vortioxetine  shows  anxiolytic  and  cognitive  enhancing  properties  and  analgesic  potential  in 
animal models. 
The  recommended  dose  proposed  by  the  Applicant  in  the  SmPC  is  10  mg  once  daily  (taken  with  or 
without food). Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 
20 mg daily or reduced to a minimum of 5 mg daily. After the depressive symptoms resolve, treatment 
for at least 6 months is recommended for consolidation of the antidepressive response. 
The  clinical  development  programme  focused  on  showing  safety  and  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  1  mg, 
2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg against placebo in the rather wide MDE indication. Supportive 
studies were performed to demonstrate efficacy in the elderly, relapse prevention, and maintenance of 
the therapeutic effect during long-term treatment. 
About the product 
Vortioxetine  (1-[2-(2,4-dimethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-phenyl]-piperazine)  belongs  to  a  new  chemical  class 
of  psychotropics,  the  bis-aryl-sulfanyl  amines,  which  is  structurally  different  from  all  currently  known 
psychotropics.  
The mechanism of action  of Vortioxetine is thought to be related to its multimodal activity which is a 
combination  of  two  pharmacological  modes  of  action:  direct  modulation  of  receptor  activity  and 
inhibition of the serotonin transporter. Non-clinical data indicate that Vortioxetine  is a 5-HT3, and 5-
HT7,  and  5-HT1D  receptor  antagonist,  5-HT1B  receptor  partial  agonist,  5-HT1A  receptor  agonist  and 
inhibitor  of  the  5-HT  transporter,  leading  to  modulation  of  neurotransmission  in  several  systems, 
including  predominantly  the  serotonin  but  probably  also  the  norepinephrine,  dopamine,  histamine, 
acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate systems. This multimodal activity is considered responsible for the 
antidepressant  and  anxiolytic-like  effects  and  the  improvement  of  cognitive  function,  learning  and 
memory  observed  with  vortioxetine  in  animal  studies.  However,  the  precise  contribution  of  the 
individual  targets  to  the  observed  pharmacodynamic  profile  remains  unclear  and  caution  should  be 
applied when extrapolating animal data directly to man.

The  tablets  are  available  in  PVC/PVdC  blisters  or  white  HDPE  bottles  with  child-proof  closure  and 
tamper-evident  seal.  The  oral  drops  are  packed  in  amber  glass  bottles  with  dropper  applicator  (low 
density  polyethylene),  and  child-proof  screw  cap  (polypropylene)  as  described  in  section  6.5  of  the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Vortioxetine  has  been  qualified  as  a  new  active  substance.  Its  salts,  Vortioxetine  hydrobromide  and 
Vortioxetine  DL-lactate have been used to manufacture the immediate-release film-coated tablets and 
the oral drops respectively. 
Vortioxetine hydrobromide  
The  chemical  name  of  Vortioxetine    hydrobromide  is  1-[2-(2,4-dimethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-phenyl]-
piperazine hydrobromide and has the following structure: 
The  molecular  formula  is  C18H22N2S.HBr  and  its  relative  molecular  mass  is  298.45  mg/mol  as  a  free 
base and 379.36 mg/mol as the hydrobromide salt. 
Vortioxetine hydrobromide appears as a white to very slightly beige powder, non-hygroscopic, soluble 
in methanol and ethanol and slightly soluble in water and aqueous solutions at pH 2.0 to 8.3. Its pKa is 
9.1 as the free base and 3.0 as the salt. 
Vortioxetine  exhibits  polymorphism  and  appears  in  four  polymorphs.  The  most  thermodynamically 
stable  polymorphic  form  has  been  determined  and  the  crystallisation  process  is  designed  to 
consistently deliver this form. 
Vortioxetine has a non-chiral molecular structure. 
Manufacture 
Vortioxetine  hydrobromide  is  manufactured  in  two  well  defined  synthetic  steps,  followed  by 
recrystallization  and  milling.  The  starting  materials  used  are  well  defined  and  commercially  available 
with acceptable specifications. Two sites are involved in the manufacture of Vortioxetine hydrobromide. 
The  route  of  synthesis  has  been  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  adequate  in-process  controls  are 
applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented.  Information  about  the  formation,  presence,  origin  and 
fate of impurities during manufacture has been satisfactorily discussed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented.

Representative  batch  analysis  data  provided  for  the  two  proposed  manufacturing  sites  produced  with 
the proposed synthetic route show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for identification (HPLC, FTIR and NIR), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC and GC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition, heavy metals and particle size. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data for a number of commercial and development batches of the active substance are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  were  provided  on  2  pilot  and  9  production  scale  batches  of Vortioxetine    hydrobromide 
active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in a container closure system representative 
of  that  intended  for  the  market.  According  to  the  ICH  guidelines  the  samples  were  stored  up  to  48 
months  under  long  term  conditions  at  25ºC/60%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions at 40ºC/75% RH. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one  batch. Results on stress 
conditions 60°C/80% RH were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay and impurities. The analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
Vortioxetine DL-lactate  
Vortioxetine  DL-lactate  is  a  lactate  salt  of  vortioxetine  and  its  chemical  name  is  1-[2-(2,4-dimethyl-
phenylsulfanyl)-phenyl]-piperazine (RS)-2-hydroxypropanoate and has the following structure: 
The molecular formula is C18H22N2S.C3H6O3 and its relative molecular mass as the lactate salt is 388.52 
mg/mol.  The  lactate  salt  of  vortioxetine  is  used  for  the  oral  drops  formulation  due  to  its  increased 
solubility in polar solvents. 
Vortioxetine lactate appears as a white to beige powder, non-hygroscopic, soluble in polar solvents and   
water. Its pKa is 9.1 as the free base and 3.0 as the salt. 
Vortioxetine  exhibits  polymorphism  and  appears  in  three  polymorphs.  The  most  thermodynamically 
stable  polymorphic  form  has  been  determined  and  the  crystallisation  process  is  designed  to 
consistently deliver this form. 
Manufacture 
Vortioxetine  DL-lactate  is  manufactured  from  the  milled  Vortioxetine  hydrobromide  via  the  non- 
isolated free base. One site is involved in the manufacture of the lactate salt of Vortioxetine.

on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Representative  batch  analysis  data  provided  for  the  proposed  manufacturing  site  produced  with  the 
proposed synthetic route show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  identification  (HPLC,  FTIR),  assay  (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC and GC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition, heavy metals and particle size. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch  analysis  data  for  four  commercial  and  development  batches  of  the  active  substance  are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  were  provided  on  three  pilot  batches  of  Vortioxetine    DL-lactate  active  substance  from 
the  proposed  manufacturer  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package.  According  to  the  ICH 
guidelines the samples were stored up to 48 months under long term conditions at 25ºC/60% RH and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75% RH. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one  batch. Results on stress 
conditions 60°C/80% RH were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay and impurities. The analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Film-coated tablets 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Vortioxetine immediate-release film-coated tablets contain 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg of the Vortioxetine (as 
hydrobromide salt). 
During the pharmaceutical development the applicant evaluated different formulations to find the most 
appropriate  combination  of  excipients  and  physicochemical  and  biological  properties  of  the 
formulation/blend  to  manufacture  the  tablet  with  the  best  possible  tablet  characteristics  and 
dissolution  rate.  The  dissolution  rate  is  influenced  by  the  particle  size  and  therefore  the  active 
substance is milled to obtain the required particle size distribution throughout the blend. 
The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been evaluated using binary mixtures 
in stability studies.

All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. The development 
of the manufacturing process of film-coated tablets 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg was performed at 
pilot scale on similar equipment used for production scale.  
The 
film-coated 
tablets  are  packed 
in  polyvinyl chloride/polyvinylidene chloride/aluminium 
(PVC/PVdC/alu)  blisters  and  in  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  containers.  The  material  complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  immediate  release  dosage  form  involves  the  following  steps: 
blending, fluid bed granulation, drying, blending, compression and film coating. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV  and  FT-IR),  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  assay  (HPLC), 
degradation products (HPLC), dissolution, water content and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  pilot  scale  batches  for  each  strength,  confirming  the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 24 
months at 25ºC/60% RH and intermediate conditions at 30°C/75% RH, and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for tablet description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products  and  also  to  a  humidity  stress  test  during  3  months  at 
25°C/93% RH. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable.

Oral drops 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim was to develop an oral drops formulation with a concentration of 20 mg vortioxetine per ml to 
be  administered  with  a  dropper  device  corresponding  to  20  drops  for  a  dose  of  20  mg  vortioxetine. 
Unlike  the  film-coated  tablets  where  a  hydrobromide  salt  of  the  active  substance  is  used,  the  oral 
drops  formulation  contains  vortioxetine  DL-lactate  as  the  active  substance  which  shows  higher 
solubility 
in  polar  solvents.  The  solubility 
is 
further 
increased  due  to  the  presence  of 
hydroxypropylbetadex  in  the  formulation.  The  substitution  degree  and  the  temperature  necessary  for 
interaction  with  the  active  substance  were  investigated  and  taken  into  consideration  during  the 
development.  Both  parameters  were  not 
found 
critical 
for 
the 
interaction  between 
hydroxypropylbetadex and vortioxetine.  
The other excipient, ethanol 96%, increases the number of drops per ml and at the same time serves 
as preservative. Various ratios were investigated and a concentration of 8.5% (w/v) gave the desired 
drop  number  of  20  drops/ml.  The  oral  drops  formulation  is  self-preserving  which  is  confirmed  with  a 
test for efficacy of antimicrobial preservation. Purified water serves as vehicle for the formulation. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  formulation  used  in  the  clinical  bioequivalence  study  was  the  same  as  the  formulation  used  for 
marketing. The study also showed bioequivalence between the oral drops solution, 20 mg/ml and the 
20 mg film-coated tablet formulation. 
The primary packaging is an amber glass bottle with dropper applicator and child-proof screw cap. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and  EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: preparation of the bulk solution, filtration and 
subsequent filling of the amber bottles. The manufacturing process is carried out protected from light. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
include  description  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  vortioxetine  (HPLC),  assay  ethanol  96% 
(GC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  dose  and  uniformity  of  dose  of  oral  drops,  pH  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbial quality( Ph. Eur.). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

Batch analysis results are provided for three batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of two production scale and one pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long 
term  conditions  for  18  months  at  25ºC/60%  RH  and  intermediate  conditions  at  30°C/75%  RH,  and   
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  representative  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  vortioxetine  assay,  ethanol  assay,  degradation  products,  dose 
and uniformity of dose of oral drops, pH, colour of solution and microbiological quality. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products and in–use stability studies were performed on two batches stored 
for up to 8 weeks after first opening of the bottles at 25°C/60% RH. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion  on  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on 
biological aspects 
the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the nonclinical program VOR was administered orally, subcutaneously (SC), intraperitoneally, and/or 
intravenously (IV) in aqueous solutions of hydroxypropyl-betacyclodextrin (vehicle) (HP-β-CD) to mice, 
rats, dogs, and rabbits. 
Pivotal  nonclinical  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  with  the  hydrobromide  (HBr)  salt  of  VOR. 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies were conducted with the HBr salt, except for the human ether-à-go-
go-related gene (hERG) assay, where the hydrochloride salt was used. Since VOR was used in solution, 
no  differentiation  was  made  between  salts.  Thus,  in  this  EPAR  the  term  VOR  (VOR)  will  be  used, 
irrespective of the salt form used.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The in vitro studies in recombinant cell lines showed that Vortioxetine  acts as an antagonist at 5-HT3, 
5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptors, a partial agonist at 5-HT1B receptors, an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, 
and  as  an  inhibitor  of  the  5-HTT  both  in  human  and  rats.  When  taking  into  account  the  unbound 
plasma  concentration  at  doses  of  20  mg  of  Vortioxetine  attained  in  healthy  volunteers  following 
repeated administration (Cmax unbound = 1.3 nmol/L), the binding affinities for the h5-HT3 receptor 
and  the  h5-HTT  are  the  only  ones  to  be  considered  therapeutically  relevant.    At  10-fold  higher  free 
plasma  concentration,  however,  5-HT1A  agonistic  and  5-HT7  antagonistic  effects  come  into  play.    In 
the  in  vitro  functionality  assays  IC50/EC50  levels  are  several  fold  higher  than  the  unbound  plasma 
concentration  at  doses  of  20  mg  of  Vortioxetine  attained  in  healthy  volunteers  following  repeated 
administration: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the IC50 for the h5-HT3A antagonist activity is 7.7-fold higher  
the Kb for the h5-HT7 antagonist activity is still 346-fold higher  
the Kb for the h5-HT1D antagonist activity is 19-fold higher  
the in vitro partial agonist activity at the h5-HT1B receptor is observed at concentrations that 
are 92- up to 354-fold higher 
the in vitro EC50 for the h5-HT1A agonist activity is 153-fold higher 
the  in  vitro  inhibitory  activity  of  h5-HTT  is  seen  at  clinically  relevant  unbound  plasma 
concentrations.   
Vortioxetine  has  comparable  potency  at  the  human  and  rat  5-HTT,  and  5-HT1B  receptors,  it  is  more 
potent (4- to 10-fold) as 5-HT3 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist in the rat as compared to human and 
less potent (approximately 10-fold) as 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist in the 
rat  as  compared  to  human.  This  may  imply  that  the  in  vivo  activities  measured  in  the  rat  may  be 
somewhat  overestimated  with  respect  to  impact  of  5-HT3  and  5-HT1D  receptor  antagonism  and 
somewhat  underestimated  with  respect  to  impact  of  5-HT1A  receptor  agonism  and  5-HT7  receptor 
antagonism as compared to effects in humans. 
Vortioxetine  did  not  reveal  clinically  relevant  interaction  with  other  targets  when  a  broad  panel  of 
receptors was tested at concentration up to or above 1000 nM. 
The pharmacologically active doses in acute mechanistic and behavioural studies are in general in the 
range of 2.5 to 20 mg/kg SC (plasma concentrations approximately 170-900 ng/mL according to Study 
929-300 2111 042) corresponding to >50% occupancy at the 5-HTT. In the low end of the dose range, 
inhibition of r5-HT3 receptors and r5-HTT is likely to account for the net pharmacological effects while 
inhibition of r5-HT1B and stimulation of r5-HT1A receptors and likely also inhibition of r5-HT1D and 5-
HT7 receptors contribute to the net effect in the high end of the dose interval.  
The  ED50’s  for  receptor  occupancy  are  either  at  plasma  exposures  below  (5-HT3),  equal  (5-HTT)  or 
above  (5-HT1B:  2-  fold,  5-HT1A  27-fold  at  ED43.8)  plasma  concentration  at  doses  of  20  mg  of 
Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL).  As such, the in vivo target profile of 
Vortioxetine is compatible with the notion of a multimodal mode of action involving 5-HT3 antagonism, 
5-HT1B partial agonism and 5-HTT inhibition.

As can be concluded from the in vivo mechanistic studies, acute i.v. dosing of Vortioxetine suppressed 
the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons in rats (ED50 548 µg/kg). The effect is mediated via a 
5-HT1A  receptor-dependent  mechanism  and  involving  contribution  of  5-HT3  receptor  antagonism  to 
the net effect of Vortioxetine in this assay.  
Administration  of  Vortioxetine    at  a  dose  corresponding  to  40%-50%  5-HTT  occupancy  produced  a 
significant reduction in the firing activity of rat dorsal raphe neurons 5 to 10 hours following continous 
drug  delivery  by  an  implanted  minipump.    There  is  a  rapid  recovery  from  the  neuronal  suppression 
(recovery of the firing frequency to control levels at 24 hours and maintenance at these levels at 3, 7 
and  15  days).    Co-administration  of  Vortioxetine    and  the  5-HT3  receptor  agonist  SR57227 
counteracted  the  acute  inhibitory  effect  of  vortioxetine  on  dorsal  raphe  nucleus  firing  and  delayed 
recovery thus pointing to the involvement of 5-HT3 antagonistic activity. 
Vortioxetine  also  showed  an  antidepressant  or  anxiolytic-like  profile  in  following  in  vivo  behavioural 
assays: 
•  Novelty-induced  suppression  of  feeding  in  129SvEvTac  mice  (MED  =  5  mg/kg/day  p.o.,  no 
effect  at  20  mg/kg/day),  accompanied  by  enhanced  cell  proliferation  and  maturation  in  the 
hippocampus 
•  Mouse (NIH Swiss mice) forced swim test (15.8 mg/kg s.c.) 
•  Rat (SD) foot shock-induced ultrasonic vocalization (MED=3.9 mg/kg s.c.) 
•  Rat (SD) social interaction test (1 mg/kg p.o.  3 ng/ml).  
Except for the rat social interaction test, the active doses are in the high end of the dose range, where 
more  targets  in  addition  to  5-HT3  receptor  and  the  5-HTT  are  expected  to  be  involved  in  the 
pharmacological  effects.    Plasma  exposures  are  available  only  for  the  rat  social  interaction  test  and 
they are slightly lower than the plasma exposures attained following a single clinical dose of 20 mg of 
Vortioxetine  in  healthy  volunteers  (Cmax  =  8.03  ng/mL).  Vortioxetine  is  active  in  the  rat  social 
interaction test at doses where the occupancy at the 5-HTT is less than 20%, which may be regarded 
as negligible, hence the effect is most likely mediated through 5-HT3 receptor antagonism.  
The  mouse  marble  burying  test  in  CD-1  mice  (s.c.)  and  the  olfactory  bulbectomised  test  in  SD  rats 
(p.o.) are considered failed tests as the respective positive controls failed to exhibit an effect. 
Vortioxetine  also  failed  to reverse  the  stress-induced  hedonic  deficit  measured  as  intake  of  a  sucrose 
solution  in  the  rat  chronic  mild  stress  test  (Wistar  rats,  i.p.,  5  weeks),  whereas  the  positive  control 
compound, imipramine, 10 mg/kg/day, IP, was active. 
Vortioxetine  showed  memory  enhancing  effects  in  a  rat  contextual  fear-conditioning  paradigm  (5 
mg/kg  s.c.)  and  novel  object  recognition  model  (10  mg/kg  s.c.)  at  doses  corresponding  to  5-HTT 
occupancies of about 90%. The SSRI, escitalopram, is also active in these assays in normal rats at 5-
HTT occupancies greater than 90%.However, Vortioxetine unlike escitalopram and duloxetine recovers 
cognitive deficits in rats following 5-HT depletion even at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg (corresponding to 
a 5-HTT occupancy less than 20%, 5-HT3 receptor mediated). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Vortioxetine  demonstrates  analgesic  potential in  models  of  pain  with  central  sensitization  (the  mouse 
formalin model) and neuropathic pain (the rat chronic constriction nerve injury model), whereas there 
is no activity against inflammatory pain as assessed in the carrageenan paw model. Hence Vortioxetine  
shows potential as treatment of centrally mediated pain.

Most  SSRIs  and  SNRIs  cause  treatment  related  sexual  dysfunction.    Consequently,  Vortioxetine  was 
tested  in  a  sexual  behaviour  study  in  male  rats.  Unlike  the  SSRI  fluoxetine,  Vortioxetine  did  not 
significantly influence male rat sexual behaviour (noted a transient decrease in anticipatory level in the 
low-dose group and a slight non-statistically significant decrease in the number of ejaculations) in spite 
of  high  levels  of  5-HTT  occupancy  with  both  drugs  (70%  for  Vortioxetine  as  compared  to  98%  for 
fluoxetine),  8-9  hours  after  the  last  dose.  In  concert  with  the  lack  of  fertility  effects  in  reproduction 
toxicity  investigations  or  on  reproductive  organs  in  multiple  dose  toxicity  studies,  these  findings 
suggest a lower risk of sexual side effects of Vortioxetine than for SSRI or SNRI antidepressants (see 
below). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Vortioxetine did not impair central nervous system function as evident by an Irwin test and the rotarod 
performance  in  rats.  In  behavioural  studies  in  dogs,  only  sedation  was  noted  at  clinically  relevant 
plasma exposures. This sign is consistent with observations noted in the toxicity studies. 
In in vitro cardiovascular studies, Vortioxetine  had a minor effect on currents of hERG (IC50 2538-fold 
higher than human unbound plasma exposure) and cloned human cardiac SCN5A sodium ion channels 
(IC50 715-fold higher than human unbound plasma exposure).   
Vortioxetine administered to dogs in with single or sequential IV infusions induced minor prolongation 
of  the  PR  intervals.  As  such,  in  the  definitive  study  in  conscious  restrained  male  and  female  Beagle 
dogs  at  NOEL,  plasma  levels  and  AUC  were,  respectively,  1.4-fold  higher  and 7.5  fold  lower than  the 
values measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL). 
At the NOEL of 0.94(initial)/0.08(maintenance) mg/kg iv. dose in the anesthetised female dog study, 
plasma  levels  were  14-fold  higher  than  the  plasma  exposures  measured  at  doses  of  20  mg  of 
Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers.  
Likewise, PR-prolongations were observed upon oral vortioxetine administration in dog toxicity studies 
over  4 weeks  (plasma  exposure  at  the  no-observed  effect  level=101/84  ng/mL  for  males/females, 
plasma  levels  are  3/2.5(M/F)-fold  higher  than  the  plasma  exposures  measured  at  doses  of  20  mg  of 
Vortioxetine  attained  in  healthy  volunteers)  and  13 weeks.  The  effects  on  PR  interval  are  noted  at 
plasma exposures exceeding human the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine 
attained in  healthy  volunteers  by  4.6/6.3(M/F)-fold.    PR-prolongations  were  however  not  observed in 
the  clinical  program.  In  anesthetized  guinea  pigs,  no  effects  on  pulmonary  resistance  or  compliance 
were observed with IV doses up to 20 mg/kg. In freely moving rats, no biologically significant adverse 
effects  were  seen  on  respiratory  parameters  with  doses  up  to  20  mg/kg  (PO,  gavage).  No 
bronchoconstrictive  effects  of  Vortioxetine  were  observed  at  PO  doses  ≤40  mg/kg.  At  40  mg/kg,  a 
significant reduction in the peak expiratory flow was observed. 
Respiratory  measurements  in  IV  dosed  conscious  dogs  showed  that  the  pH  of  the  arterial  blood  was 
reduced  with  a  NOEL  of  1.5  mg/kg  (plasma  levels  are  3-fold  higher  than  the  plasma  exposures 
measured  at  doses  of  20 mg  of  Vortioxetine  attained  in  healthy  volunteers  (Cmax  =  33  ng/mL)).  No 
statistically significant effects were observed in pCO2 and pO2 at plasma exposures below 210 ng/mL. 
Vortioxetine  had  no  pharmacodynamic  renal  effects  in  male  and  female  rats  at  20  mg/kg  twice  daily 
(BID) in a renal function study where Vortioxetine was administered for 5 days at oral doses up to 40 
mg/kg  BID.  At  40  mg/kg  BID,  changes  in  sodium  and  chloride  excretion  and  in  urine  osmolarity  and 
albumin  levels  were  noted.  No  changes  in  creatinine  clearance  were  observed.  At  NOEL  (20  mg/kg 
BID), plasma levels are 5.6/8.7(M/F)-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 
mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL). 
A gastrointestinal transit study in rats showed that VOR, 20, 40, and 100 mg/kg, PO, corresponding to 
respective average plasma levels of 198, 497, and 749 ng/mL, caused a dose-dependent decrease in 
Brintellix

gastric emptying but only a marginal reduction in charcoal transit in the small intestine. At these dose 
levels, plasma exposures are 1.4 up to 6.4-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses 
of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL). 
In  dogs,  presumed  abdominal  pain  (manifested  by  hunched  back  and  discomfort  during  abdominal 
palpation) was observed at IV doses ≥1.5 mg/kg, corresponding to plasma exposures that are 3.2-fold 
higher  than  the  plasma  exposures  measured  at  doses  of  20  mg  of  Vortioxetine  attained  in  healthy 
volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL). 
Consequently,  gastrointestinal  effects  can  be  expected  in  the  clinical  setting  and  this  is  reflected  in 
section 4.8 and 4.9 of the SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Conduct  of  nonclinical  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  with  Vortioxetine    were  considered 
not  to  be  relevant  as  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  were  addressed  in  clinical  pharmacology 
studies. 
This was considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic properties of vortioxetine were predominantly investigated in mice, rats and dogs, i.e. 
species  tested  in  toxicology  studies,  and  were  further  compared  using  plasma  and  hepatocytes  from 
rabbits, guinea pigs and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
The  oral  absolute  bioavailability  was  approximately  10%  in  the  rat,  48%  in  the  dog  and  75%  in 
patients,  with  terminal  elimination  half-life  values of  3.0,  7.9  and  66  hours,  respectively.  In  patients, 
the  absorption  was  relatively  slow  (Tmax  from  6  to  10h).  Both  in  dogs  and  in  rats  there  is  a 
disproportionate  increase  in  AUC  after  oral  administration  while  in  patients  pharmacokinetics  were 
dose-proportional.  Consistent  with  the  elimination  half-life,  Vortioxetine    accumulates  5-  to  6-fold  in 
patients after multiple dosing. Gender differences in plasma Cmax and AUC were observed in rats and 
in mice after oral administration. Gender differences were first observed in one clinical study, however 
after normalisation to weight no more gender differences were observed in patients.  
After  repeated  oral  administration  in  rats  and  dogs,  the  half-life  of  Vortioxetine  very  significantly 
increased  with  dose  which  could  suggest  some  kind  of  accumulation.  However,  PK  data  from  a  four-
week  toxicology  study  in  dogs  resulted  in  a  mean  half-life  similar  to  single  dose  administration.  No 
accumulation  was  seen  after  single  dose  oral  administration  in  the  distribution  study  in  rats.  In 
patients, the half-life of Vortioxetine did not vary with oral dose after single or repeated administration.  
Pharmacokinetics  of  two  metabolites  of  Vortioxetine  were  studied  in  dogs.  Lu  AA34443  is  the  major 
metabolite in all species and in patients. Lu AA34994 is an intermediate that was identified in vitro but 
never detected in vivo. Lu AA34994 metabolism further leads to Lu AA34443.  
Distribution  studies  with  [14C]Vortioxetine  and  drug-related  material  in  male  rats  showed  fast 
absorption and distribution to all organs and tissues. Vortioxetine binds to melanine and concentrations 
of  drug-related  material  were  higher  in  melanin  containing  tissues.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  over 
time occurred more rapidly in the albino Wistar Han rat as compared to the pigmented Lister Hooded 
rat,  with  approximately  half  the  number  of  tissues  being  below  the  limit  of  quantification  after  24 
hours. At 504 hours after dose administration, radioactivity was only quantifiable in the pigmented skin 
and uveal tract of the Lister Hooded rat. In vitro protein binding of [14C]Vortioxetine  in human plasma

was high (98.8%) and similar to the plasma protein binding in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs (between 
99.1% to 99.8%). 
All  metabolites  detected  in  human  hepatocytes  were  also  present  in  dogs,  mice  and  rats  (plasma 
and/or urine) in vivo, except for a glucuronide conjugate of monohydroxy-Vortioxetine which was not 
found  in  mice  or  rats.  Among  all  species  tested,  rabbit  hepatocytes  appeared  to  have  the  metabolite 
profile closer to human hepatocyte metabolite profile.  
Vortioxetine and/or metabolites inhibited the following CYPs: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and 
CYP2C8  at  high  concentrations.  Clinical  trials  assessing  drug-drug  interaction  of  Vortioxetine  with 
regard  to  CYP2C19,  CYP2C9,  CYP3A4  and  CYP2B6  did  not  demonstrate  an  inhibitory  activity  of  the 
treatment on these enzymes.  
Vortioxetine and related material was mainly excreted by faeces in mice (84 %), rats (69 %) and dogs 
(59-65 %  in  two  separate  studies),  whereas  humans  showed  prominent  urinary  excretion  (59 %) 
compared  to  faeces  (26 %).  In  excretion  studies,  the  recovery  of  [14C]Vortioxetine    and  related 
material  was  close  to  100%  in  rodents.  Dogs  and  humans  exhibited  a  protracted  excretion  and  the 
recovery  was  approximately  90%  and  85%  after  168  hours  and  360  hours,  respectively. Excretion in 
maternal  milk  was  demonstrated  in  rats.  This  was  included  in  the  SmPC  section  5.3,  with  a  cross-
reference in section 4.6. 
Studies  were  conducted  to  determine  the  composition  and  solubility  of  the  crystalline  material 
observed  in  the  kidney  and  liver  of  rats  and  in  the  liver  of  mice  in  repeat-dose  studies.  The  crystals 
were  found  to  be  composed  of  the  carboxylic  acid metabolite  Lu  AA34443  and  M3  (glucuronide  of  Lu 
AA39835).  It  is  concluded  that  the  crystal  formation  was  due  to  exceeded  solubility  of  these 
metabolites. The M3 metabolite is only found in trace amounts in human feces and urine, in contrast to 
the  high  concentrations  found  in  rodents.  The  mean  concentration  of  Lu  AA34443  in  human  urine  is 
clearly  below  the  determined  solubility  of  this  metabolite  in  human  urine.  It  is  thus  considered  that 
crystal formation is unlikely to occur in patients. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicity  studies  with  Vortioxetine  ranging  from  single-dose  studies  up  to 26- or  52-week  repeat-dose 
toxicity  studies  were  conducted.  The  rat  and  dog  were  used  as  the  primary  rodent  and  non-rodent 
species, respectively. 
A standard set of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies was performed and the carcinogenic potential 
of  Vortioxetine  was  investigated  in  two  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mice  and  rats,  respectively. 
Potential effects on fertility and pre- and postnatal development were assessed in the rat and embryo-
fetal developmental toxicity studies were conducted in the rat and the rabbit. 
Other studies included immunotoxicity (as part of the 13-week rat toxicity study), intravenous (IV) 7- 
and 14-day toxicity studies in rats and dogs, a local lymph node assay (LLNA) for assessment of skin 
sensitization in mice, and mechanistic toxicity studies in dogs (to address the convulsive episodes seen 
in this species) and rats (mechanistic evaluation of crystalline materials in liver and kidney). 
Vortioxetine  was  administered  orally  to  dogs  and  twice  daily  to  rabbit,  rat  and  mouse  due  to  its 
relatively  short  plasma  half-life  in  these  species.  Due  to  severe  toxicity  the  dosing  regimen  was 
changed to once daily dosing for the mouse. 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013

HP-β-CD was  chosen as the vehicle for the formulations of Vortioxetine in order to enhance solubility 
and  oral  bioavailability.  In  the  rabbit  studies,  vehicle-mediated  effects  on  bodyweight,  food 
consumption, and faeces were seen and in the rat carcinogenicity study, vehicle-mediated effects were 
seen in the large intestines. According to the literature, the main effects of oral administration of high 
doses  of  HP-β-CD  are  related  to  the  large  load  of  poorly  digestable,  osmotically  active  carbohydrates 
which leads to soft and/or loose faeces in rats and dogs and effects on bodyweight, food consumption, 
and  faeces  in  rabbits.  In  addition,  oral  administration  of  HP-β-CD  has  effects  on  haematological  and 
clinical  chemistry  parameters  and  induces  histological  changes  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  liver, 
pancreas, and urinary tract. 
Toxicokinetic  (TK)  profiling  or  proof  of  systemic  exposure  measurements  of  vortioxetine  were 
performed  in  all  pivotal  studies.  Additional  TK  measurements  of  metabolites  were  performed  in 
selected studies. 
All  pivotal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP  principles.  GLP  compliance  is  not 
claimed for all dose range-finding studies. 
The bioanalytical phases of 10 nonclinical toxicity studies were affected by a case of misconduct during 
the  conduct  of  the  bioanalyses  at  a  contract  research  organization.  The  misconduct  resulted  in  10 
deficiencies relating to the bioanalytical work. GLP compliance cannot be claimed for the bioanalytical 
phases of the 10 nonclinical studies. However, based on the investigation and the remedial work of the 
Applicant, the overall conclusions of the studies are adequate. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  the  mouse  and  in  the  rat  following  oral  or  iv 
administration  of  LUAA21004.  In  both  species,  clinical  signs  related  to  CNS  effects  occurred  rapidly 
after oral dosing and included marked sensitivity to touch, tremor, partly closed eye, rapid breathing, 
hypoactivity  and  perinasal  staining.  Clinical  signs  observed  at  doses  higher  than  the  MTD  resulted  in 
convulsions  in  both  sexes  after  single  oral  or  iv  administration  of  LuAA21004.  The  MTD  were  300 
mg/kg (mouse) and 500 mg/kg (rat) after oral administration and between 20 and 30 mg/kg in both 
species following iv dosing.   
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  ranging  up  to  26-  or  52-weeks  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog. 
The main findings during the repeat-dose toxicity studies were clinical signs associated with the effect 
of Vortioxetine on the central nervous system (CNS) in all species and changes in the liver and kidneys 
of rodents.  
CNS effects 
Clinical signs of convulsions were seen in the mouse in the non-pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies at 
dose of 200mg/kg/day. No convulsions and no other CNS clinical sign (except sporadic overactivity in 
female) were seen during 26 week treatment at daily dose up to 50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg in the male 
and female mouse, respectively.   
No sign of convulsions were seen during repeat-dose toxicity in the rat up to 26 weeks at oral dose of 
40 mg/kg/BID that corresponded to a safety margin of 17 and 15 for male and female, respectively, as 
compared to the exposure in human at the maximum daily recommended dose (20 mg). 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 21/159 
 
  
 
In the dogs, following oral administration of Vortioxetine, episodes of convulsions were observed in two 
females at 10 and 15 mg/kg/day doses, respectively, within the first days of treatment in the 13-week 
toxicity study.  A no effect level for convulsions was established at 7.5 mg/kg/day in the 52-week dog 
study.  This  corresponded  to  a  plasma  exposure  level  4.7  -fold  the  human  exposure  at  the  maximum 
recommended  therapeutic  dose  of  20  mg/day  Vortioxetine  (AUC  for  single  dose:  645.51,  AUC  for 
multiple dose: 646 ng.h/mL). A mechanistic study confirmed that the major metabolite of LuAA21004, 
LuAA34443,  was  not  responsible  for  the  convulsions  seen  in  the  dog  following  oral  administration  of 
LuAA21004.  Taking  into  account  the  narrow  dose  range  between  the  NOEL  and  the  occurrence  of 
convulsions  (7.5  mg/kg/day  vs  10  mg/kg/day)  in  this  species  and  the  fact  that  two  episodes  of 
convulsions  were  reported  during  clinical  trial  (although  being  of  alternative  ethiology),  arisk  of 
convulsions in human cannot be excluded and is reflected in the SmPC and followed up in the RMP.   
In  addition  to  convulsions,  other  LUAA21004-related  CNS  effects  were  seen  in  all  the  species  used 
during repeat-dose toxicity studies. In the mouse, the principal clinical signs were tremor, hypoactivity, 
abdominal  distension,  noisy  respiration,  piloerection,  ungroomed  coat,  and  vocalization  occurring  at 
doses  ≥  50  mg/kg/day.  In  the  rat,  salivation  was  seen  at  all  the  doses  tested.  In  the  dogs,  pupil 
dilatation/incomplete pupil contraction, was noted in both male and female at ≥ 3.75 mg/kg/day. 
Kidney toxicity 
Pale  appearance  and  increase  kidneys  weight  were  observed  in  the  mouse.  With  daily  regimen 
increased kidneys weight was only seen during the 13 week study without any related-findings in blood 
chemistry/urinalysis parameters and histopathological examination.  
In  contrast,  renal  toxicity  was  found  in  the  rat  in  the  MTD,  13-  and  26-week  toxicity  studies  at  40 
mg/kg BID and above. The toxic findings included glomerulonephritis and kidney changes indicative of 
renal tubular obstruction by crystals. There was evidence of an effect upon renal function as indicated 
by  alteration  of  the  urinary  composition  (production  of  higher  volume  of  diluted  urine,  presence  of 
blood,  and  variations  of  plasma  and  urinary  electrolytes).  After  a  12-week  treatment-free  recovery 
period,  kidney  findings  similar  to  those  detected  at  the  end  of  the  26-week  treatment  period  were 
present in 1/6 males that received 40 mg/kg BID. 
The risk to human is considered low, however, the non-clinical finding is considered a potential risk and 
followed up in the RMP 
Liver toxicity 
In mice, repeat oral administration of LuAA21004 resulted in liver toxicity characterized by hepatocyte 
necrosis, presence of inflammatory cells, bile duct hyperplasia, crystalline material in bile ducts, and an 
increase in hepatocyte mitotic activity predominantly in the males. In female, cytoplasmic hepatocyte 
vacuolation was seen at dose of 200 mg/kg/day.  With regard to liver toxicity the NOAEL for male mice 
was 50 mg/kg/day whereas it was 200 mg/kg/day in females.  
Liver  toxicity  was  also  noticed  in  the  rat.  This  included  hepatocellular  hypertrophy,  hepatocyte 
necrosis,  bile  duct  hyperplasia  and  presence  of  crystal  material  in  the  duct.  With  regards  to  liver 
necrosis the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/BID in the rat.  Based on this values a safety margin of LuAA21004 
exposure  levels  was  only  1.6-2.2  when  compared  to  the  human  exposure  following  repeat  oral 
administration of LuAA21004 at the maximum daily recommended dose of 20 mg.  
Liver  changes  characterized  as  mild  hepatocellular  vacuolation  were  observed  in  dogs  in  the  4-week 
study,  but  were  not  confirmed  in  studies  of  longer  duration.  Changes  in  plasma  aspartate  amino-
transferase  activity  and  glucose  and  protein  concentrations  suggesting  an  effect  upon  the  liver  were 
observed in the 13-week toxicity study but these were not related to any histopathological changes. 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 22/159 
 
 
  
 
The  liver  findings  in  rodents  (focal  hepatocyte  necrosis)  are  considered  related  to  the  crystalline 
precipitation  of  the  metabolites  Lu  AA34443  and  M3  at  dosages  of  20  mg/kg  BID  (rats)  and  100 
mg/kg/day (mice) and above.  
Since  focal  hepatocyte  necrosis  is  very  common  in  mice  and  rats  and  since  they  also  occur  following 
bile duct obstruction in rats (Kountouras et al., 1984), the focal necrosis may be viewed as part of the 
other  histopathological  changes.  Furthermore,  crystal  precipitation  is  considered  not  likely  to  occur  in 
humans at therapeutic dose levels the liver findings in rodents are considered only to pose a low risk to 
humans.  The  aetiology  of  the  hepatocellular  vacuolation  observed  in  dogs  in  the  4-week  study  at  a 
dose  of  15 mg/kg  is  not  known.  However,  these  changes  were  mild  and  no  histopathology  changes 
have  been  observed  in  the  13-  and  52-week  study  in  dogs.  Furthermore,  they  were  observed  at 
exposure  levels  which  are  approximately  8-fold  to  the  human  exposure  at  the  recommended  clinical 
dose. Therefore, the relevance to humans is limited. 
A wording is proposed for section 5.3. 
Crystal formation containing LuAA34443 and M3 was confirmed in the rat renal tubules and bile ducts. 
These were considered to represent major routes of excretion of Vortioxetine and/or a metabolite. In 
rats, the concentration of Lu AA34443 in urine occasionally exceeded the solubility limit explaining the 
crystal  formation  in  rats,  while  the  concentration  of  Lu  AA34443  in  urine  in  dogs  was  below  the 
solubility limit; no renal crystal formation was noted in dogs. In human urine, the concentration of Lu 
AA34443 was 10-fold lower than the solubility limit. All together these data suggested a rodent-specific 
effect for the crystal formation that is unlikely to occur in patients with normal renal function.  
Other effects 
In the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats (Study 10194) histopathological investigation indicated 
findings in the salivary glands (degranulation of the striated ducts, acinar degranulation and/or acinar 
atrophy)  in  animals  receiving  20  or  40  mg/kg  b.i.d.  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  10  mg/kg  b.i.d.  These 
findings  were  considered  to  have  been  induced  by  the  increased  incidence  of  salivation  noted  in  the 
treated  groups  rather  than  a  result  of  systemic  toxicity.  The  Applicant  therefore  considers  these 
histopathological  and  clinical  findings  to  be  of  no  toxicological importance.  However,  degranulation  of 
striated submandibular salivary gland ducts and acinar athrophy of the sublingual salivary glands were 
also  noted  in  the  14-day  toxicity  study  in  rats  after  i.v.  administration  of  vortioxetine  (Study  10305) 
with  no  clinical  signs  of  salivation.  The  morphology  of  the  salivary  gland  changes  in  the  4-week  and 
14-day  studies  points  towards  a  functional  response  of  the  glands  induced  by  release  of 
neurotransmitters  more  than  a  direct  toxic  effect  of  the  treatment  with  vortioxetine.  This  is  also  in 
agreement with data from the literature. As such, increased levels of 5-HT due to the pharmacological 
effect of vortioxetine may have augmented the changes in the salivary gland epithelium.  The lack of 
salivary gland changes in the 13- and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats is a possible adaption to the 
dosing  procedure  and  subsequent  disappearance  of  the  changes  in  the  salivary  gland.  This  has  been 
confirmed  by  incidences  of  salivation  recorded  in  the  studies.  In  the  4-week  and  13-week  studies 
maximal  incidences  were  observed  in  weeks  2-4  and  3-4,  respectively,  thereafter  the  incidences 
decreased in the 13-week study. 
Genotoxicity 
Vortioxetine (Lu A21004) was tested in a standard battery according to ICH S2 guidelines. There was 
no evidence for any genotoxic potential of Vortioxetine.

Carcinogenicity 
In the mouse carcinogenicity study, once daily oral administration of Vortioxetine  at 50 mg/kg/day in 
males  produced  an  increased  incidence  of  benign  neoplastic  change  in  terms  of  hepatocellular 
adenomas in the liver. At this dose in males and, to a lesser extent, at 100 mg/kg/day in females there 
was  crystalline  material  in  the  lumen  of  the  biliary  system,  which  caused  a  range  of  secondary 
inflammatory changes, as a result of irritancy, in the hepatobiliary system. The increased incidence of 
benign  neoplastic  changes  in  the  high  dose  males  was  considered  likely  to  be  mediated  by  a  non-
genotoxic  mechanism  of  persistent  hepatotoxicity.  There  was  a  clear  no-effect  level  for  tumour-
formation  related  to  treatment  with  Vortioxetine  at  15  mg/kg/day  in  males  and  100  mg/kg/day  in 
females.    The  NOAEL  in  this  study,  considering  both  neoplastic  and  non-neoplastic  changes,  was  15 
mg/kg/day in males and 30 mg/kg/day in females. 
In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  neoplastic  findings  related  to  oral  administration  of  LuAA2100  were 
observed in the liver and mesenteric lymph node.   
In  the  liver,  a  slight increase  of  hepatocellular  adenomas  was  observed in  the  high  dose  groups.  The 
treatment had no effect on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, and there was a clear no-effect-
level  for  the  hepatocellular  adenoma  (7  mg/kg  b.i.d.  in  males  and  15  mg/kg  b.i.d.  in  females)  thus 
suggesting a non-genotoxic mechanism of persistent hepatotoxicity. 
In  the  mesenteric  lymph  node,  males  given  7  or  20  mg/kg  b.i.d.  showed  an  increased  incidence  of 
benign  neoplastic lesions  (benign  haemangioma),  and  angiomatous  hyperplasia  was  also  reported  for 
the  high  dose  males.  There  was  no  effect  in  females.  This  could  potentially  be  attributed  to  the 
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-induced  increase  in  cholecystokinin,  a  peptide  that  can  act  locally  as  a 
mitogen  in  rats,  but  not  in  mice,  non-human  primates  and  man.  Moreover,  a  role  is  also  being 
attributed to gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation also due to hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin. It could 
thus be hypothesized that angiogenic factors from the inflamed intestinal mucosa or increased levels of 
cholecystokinin  has  stimulated  endothelial  cell  proliferation  locally  in  the  mesenteric  lymph  node  and 
thereby  played  a  role  in  the  development  of  the  haemangiomas.  Whilst  mesenteric  lymph  node 
haemangioma  is  a  well  described  spontaneous  tumour  in  rats  that  is  most  common  in  males  with 
incidences up to 73 % in male rats in life-time studies; lymph node angiomas in humans are extremely 
rare,  not  reported  in  mesenteric  lymph  nodes,  more  common  in  females  than  males.  There  is  no 
evidence  to  support  that  the  occurrence  of  mesenteric  lymph  node  angiomas  in  rats  are  relevant  for 
humans.  Vortioxetine  is  non-genotoxic,  no  proliferative  vascular  lesions  have  been  observed  in  the 
chronic  toxicity  studies  and  there  is  no  increase  in  malignant  vascular  neoplasms  in  rodent  studies.  
However,  benign  haemangiomas  were  seen  to  occur  dose  dependently  in  male  rats  only.    In  the 
absence  of  a  clear  clinical  correlate,  therefore,  these  findings  are  considered  to  be  of  low  clinical 
relevance. 
Non-neoplastic  findings  related  to  LUAA21004  identical  to  that  observed  in  general  toxicity  studies 
were  found  in  the  liver,  kidneys,  bile  duct,  as  well  as  in  the  stomach  (dilated  glands),  and  the 
mesenteric  lymph  node  (sinus  histiocytosis,  hyperplasia).  In  the  rat,  considering  both  neoplastic  and 
non-neoplastic findings, the NOAEL was 2 mg/kg b.i.d. in males and 15 mg/kg b.i.d. in females. 
All  of  the  treatment-related  increases  in  tumor  incidences  seen  in  mouse  or  rat  were  small  and 
involved  only  benign  lesions  and  none  of  the  findings  noted  indicate  a  carcinogenic  potential  for 
Vortioxetine in humans. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Vortioxetine  had  no  effect  on  fertility,  mating  performance,  reproductive  organs  or  on  sperm 
morphology and motility. However, a study in rats on sexual behavior showed that vortioxetine mildly 
impact  male  rat  sexual  behavior  (decreased  anticipatory  sexual  excitement  and  slightly  decreased

number  of  ejaculations).  At  high  dose  (60  mg/kg/bid),  a  decreased  in  food  consumption  was  seen  in 
dams.  The  NOAEL  for  the  male  fertility  was  60  mg/kg/b.i.d.  This  represented  a  safety  margin  of  24 
following  repeat  oral  administration  of  Vortioxetine  at  the  daily  maximum  human  recommended  dose 
(20  mg).  The  NOAEL  for  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  was  60  mg/kg/b.i.d,  that 
represented  a  safety  margin  of  16  following  repeat  oral  administration  of  Vortioxetine  at  the  daily 
maximum  human  recommended  dose  (20  mg).  Nevertheless,  as  vortioxetine  comparably  affects 
serotonin  levels  as  the  pharmacologically  related  class  of  SSRIs,  it  seems  reasonable  to  include  a 
warning  for  a  potentially  impaired  sperm  quality  in  section 4.6  of  the  SmPC  in  accordance  with  the 
recently adopted requirements of the PhVWP. 
Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in both rat and rabbit following oral administration 
of Lu AA21001 (from 5 up to 80 mg/kg/bid in the rat, from 1 up to 30 mg/kg/bid in the rabbit).  
In the rat, Vortioxetine  was found to reduce maternal body weight gain during gestation and to elicit 
body weight loss and decreased foetal weight at doses ≥ 60 mg/kg/bid. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity 
characterized by marked body weight losses and reduction in food consumption was seen at all doses 
tested (≥ 1mg/kg/bid) and decreased foetal weight was observed at doses ≥ 15 mg/kg/bid.  
Meningoceles  were  seen  in  3 foetuses  from  different  litters  of  the  10  mg/kg/bid  mid  dose  group  and 
the incidence of this finding (2.5%) was above the historical foetal rabbit background data (0.0-1.3%). 
This  occurred  at  levels  exposures  comparable  to  that  measured  in  human  at  maximum  daily 
recommended  dose  of  20mg.  The  NOAEL  with  regard  to  meningocele  occurrence  was  5mg/kg/bid  in 
the  rabbit  and  a  safety  margin  was  absent.  Moreover,  a  case  of  meningocele  was  also  seen  in  a  rat 
foetus  from  a  low  dose  group,  which  was  not  found  in  historical  background  data  for  foetal  rat 
abnormalities. The relevance of these rare findings for humans is questionable taking into account that 
this  finding  is  not  dose  dependent  and  that  pharmacological  and  toxicological  data  (including  results 
from  the  pre-  and  postnatal  toxicity  study)  do  not  suggest  a  bell-shaped  dose  response  curve  in 
animals. 
Significant  increase  in  the  incidence  of  dilated  ureters  was  seen  in  the  rat  foetuses  starting  at  low 
dosed  group.  This  is  considered  a  transient  effect  on  development  and  not  to  a  related  treatment 
effect, and it occurred in the absence of maternal toxicity. In addition, increased incidence of bilobed 
gall  bladders  was  also  seen  in  rabbit  foetuses.  This  finding  is  considered  incidental  and  unrelated  to 
treatment  although the incidence  at the  HD level  in  one  study  exceeds  historical  control  incidence  by 
more  than  2-fold.    A  subsequent  rabbit  embryofoetal  development  study  has  failed  to  demonstrate  a 
similar increase at a higher dose level. 
An increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities and variants, predominantly associated with the 
state of ossification (incomplete and/or non-ossification), mainly concerning the sternum, cervical and 
thoracic  vertebrae  and  the  bone  skull,  was  observed  in  foetuses  of  both  species.    These  skeletal 
findings appeared correlated with the disruption in maternal bodyweight performance.  
Based  on  the  above  findings,  a  potential  risk  of  delayed  foetal  development  in  humans  cannot  be 
excluded. This was reflected in the SmPC. 
Pre- and postnatal study with Vortioxetine was performed in the rat. Bodyweight and bodyweight gain 
were  reduced  in  pups  from  dams  treated  with  60  mg/kg  BID.  Vortioxetine  (≥  5  mg/kg/bid)  showed 
adverse effects on pup development at doses which did not result in maternal toxicity. 
The findings included increased pup mortality, reduced bodyweight gain, and delayed eye opening. The 
effect of Vortioxetine on pup mortality was achieved at exposures similar to those achieved in human 
at the daily recommended dose (20mg). Based on these findings, a potential risk to humans cannot be 
excluded.

In all repeat-dose toxicity studies, NOAELs have been established and the systemic exposures at these 
NOAELs  with  regard  to  the  human  exposure  at  the  maximum  therapeutic  dose  (20  mg/day)  were 
determined.  Following  concerns  regarding  the  NOAELs  established  for  some  reproduction  toxicity 
studies  the  Applicant  has  recalculated  the  NOAELs  of  the  embryo-fetal  developmental  studies  in  rats 
and rabbits and in the pre-postnatal study in rat and a wording for section 5.3 is proposed. 
A toxicity study following oral administration of Vortioxetine was done in juvenile rats from day 21 to 
day 91 of age.  There were no treatment-related findings on reproductive parameters. Both liver and 
kidneys  were  identified  as  major  target  organs.  Histopathological  changes  were  seen  in  the  liver  and 
kidneys  in  terms  of  minimal  hepatocellular  centrilobular  hypertrophy  and  vacuolation  and  minimal 
corticomedullar mineralization, respectively. Corticomedullary mineralization was mainly seen in female 
.rats  but    this  finding  was  not  evident  in  studies  where  adult  rats  were  previously  treated  with 
Vortioxetine. The reduction in incidence in the high dose female group following cessation of treatment 
suggested  a  partial  reversal  of  this  finding.  The  precise  mechanism  underlying  this  observation  was 
unclear and may be associated with a change in hormone levels in the females.  
The  survival  and  clinical  condition  of  the  offspring  born  to  parents  previously  treated  at  high  dose  of 
Vortioxetine  were  clearly  inferior  to  those  of offspring  in  the  control  group  and  those born  to  parents 
previously  treated  at  20  or  10  mg/kg/  b.i.d.  In  addition,  such  offspring  showed  clinical  sign  (cold  to 
touch,  no  milk  in  the  stomach)  that  was  not  observed  in  the  offspring  of  animals  treated  with  the 
control vehicle. In term of exposure levels this corresponded to a safety margin of only 4.  A treatment 
related effect cannot be ruled out and this finding was described under section 5.3 of the SmPC, even 
if  the  current  indication  only  concerns  adult  population  and  BRINTELLIX  is  not  recommended  in 
children under 18 years of age.  
Local tolerance 
Since the intended route for administration of BRINTELLIX in patients is oral, data from local tolerance 
studies are irrelevant. 
Other toxicity studies 
The repeated dose toxicity studies studies did not indicate potential immunotoxicity studies in mouse, 
rat  and  dog.  Therefore,  no  specific  studies  are  required  to  assess  potential  immunotoxic  effects  of 
Vortioxetine. 
Nonclinical  studies  show  that  Vortioxetine    at  a  high  dose  produced  an  increase  in  extracellular 
dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex, but failed to activate other parts of the mesolimbic dopamine 
pathway  including  the  nucleus  accumbens.  These  findings  support  that  Vortioxetine  is  devoid  of 
dependence liability. Furthermore, no discontinuation symptoms were observed in animal studies.  No 
specific  non-clinical  studies  have  been  performed  or  are  to  be  performed.    This  issue  has  been 
addressed from a clinical point of view. Consequently the Applicant will monitor the occurrence of drug 
discontinuation symptoms as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities. The newly released SMQ 
for  Drug  Abuse,  Dependence  and  Withdrawal  (MedDRA  15.0,  section  2.22)  will  be  used  to  identify 
cases.”  This is considered sufficient.

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential  risk  of  vortioxetine  to  the  environment.  The  CHMP  recommends  the  following  points  for 
further investigation: 
1.  Submission  of  Koc  values  derived  from  at  least  one  sludge  in  a  batch  equilibrium  method 
according  to  OECD  106  or  OPPTS  835.1110.  Furthermore,  the  PECsoil  and  the  PECsw-refined 
(Tier B) should be recalculated taking into account Koc values derived from at least one sludge 
to conclude on the risk for the terrestrial environment. 
2.  Submission  of  a  valid  and  plausible  test  for  collembolan  (OECD  232)  with  test  concentrations 
allowing the determination of a NOEC. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  vortioxetine  is  thought  to  be  related  to  its  direct  modulation  of 
serotonergic  receptor  activity  and  inhibition  of  the  serotonin  (5-HT)  transporter.  Non-clinical  data 
indicate  that  vortioxetine  is  a  5-HT3,  5-HT7,  and  5-HT1D  receptor  antagonist,  5-HT1B  receptor  partial 
agonist,  5-HT1A  receptor  agonist  and  inhibitor  of  the  5-HT  transporter,  leading  to  modulation  of 
neurotransmission  in  several  systems,  including  predominantly  the  serotonin  and  also  the  
norepinephrine,  dopamine,  histamine,  acetylcholine,  GABA  and  glutamate  systems.  This  multimodal 
activity  is  considered  responsible  for  the  antidepressant  and  anxiolytic-like  effects  and  the 
improvement of cognitive function, learning and memory observed with vortioxetine in animal studies. 
However,the  precise  contribution  of  the  individual  targets  to  the  observed  pharmacodynamic  profile 
remains unclear and caution should be applied when extrapolating animal data directly to man.  
Administration  of  vortioxetine  in  the  general  toxicity  studies  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  was  mainly 
associated  with  CNS-related  clinical  signs.  These  included  salivation  (rat  and  dog),  pupil  dilatation 
(dog), and two incidences of convulsions were noted in dogs during the general toxicity study program. 
A no-effect level for convulsions was established with a corresponding safety margin of 5 considering 
the  maximum  recommended  therapeutic  dose  of  20 mg/day.  Target  organ  toxicity  was  restricted  to 
kidneys  (rats)  and  liver  (mice  and  rats).  The  changes  in  the  kidney  in  rats  (glomerulonephritis,  renal 
tubular  obstruction,  crystalline  material  in  renal  tubule)  and  in  the  liver  of  mice  and  rats 
(hepatocellular  hypertrophy,  hepatocyte  necrosis,  bile  duct  hyperplasia,  crystalline  material  in  bile 
ducts) were seen at exposures more than 10-fold (mice) and 2-fold (rats) the human exposure at the 
maximum  recommended  therapeutic  dose  of  20 mg/day.  These  findings  were  mainly  attributed  to 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 29/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
rodent-specific  vortioxetine-related  crystalline  material  obstruction  of  the  renal  tubules  and  the  bile 
ducts, respectively, and considered of low risk to humans. 
Vortioxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. 
Based  on  results  from  conventional  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mice  or  rats,  vortioxetine  is  not 
considered to pose a risk of carcinogenicity in humans. 
Vortioxetine  had  no  effect  on  rat  fertility,  mating  performance,  reproductive  organs,  or  sperm 
morphology and motility. Vortioxetine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but reproductive toxicity 
in  terms  of  effects  on  foetal  weight  and  delayed  ossification  were  seen  in  the  rat  at  exposures  more 
than  10-fold  the  human  exposure  at  the  maximum  recommended  therapeutic  dose  of  20 mg/day. 
Similar effects were seen in the rabbit at sub-therapeutic exposure. 
In  a  pre-  and  post-natal  study  in  rats,  vortioxetine  was  associated  with  increased  pup  mortality, 
reduced  bodyweight  gain,  and  delayed  pup  development  at  doses  that  did  not  result  in  maternal 
toxicity and with associated exposures similar to those achieved in humans following administration of 
vortioxetine 20 mg/day. 
Vortioxetine-related material was distributed to the milk of lactating rats. 
In  juvenile  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  all  vortioxetine  treatment-related  findings  were  consistent  with 
those noted in adult animals. 
On  the  available  ERA  data  provided the  CHMP  concluded  that  Brintellix  is  expected to  pose  a  risk  for 
the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The pharmacokinetic properties of vortioxetine have been characterised across studies using both non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis and population PK analysis.  
The  clinical  pharmacology  package  for  vortioxetine  consists  of  10  human  biomaterial  studies  and  31 
clinical  pharmacology  studies  evaluating  the  pharmacokinetics  and/or  pharmacodynamics  of 
vortioxetine in humans. 
In the 31 clinical pharmacology studies, 1169 subjects received vortioxetine: 1120 healthy subjects (of 
whom  48  were  elderly  aged  65  to  78  years),  16  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment,  and  33  subjects 
with renal impairment.  
Three additional studies (Studies 14029A, CPH-004 and Study 14520A) had been completed as of 31 
August 2013.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  vortioxetine  have  been  evaluated  following  oral  administration  of  immediate 
release (IR) tablets in single doses of 2.5 to 75mg and multiple doses of 2.5 to 60mg/day. In addition, 
an  intravenous  formulation,  an  oral  drops  solution,  oral  solutions,  and  two  alternative  experimental 
enteric-coated  tablet  formulations  have  been  administered  in  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  for  the  enteric-coated  formulations  are  not  presented  in  this  Marketing 
Authorisation  Application,  since  the  sponsor  is  not  seeking  marketing  authorisation  for  these 
formulations.  However,  the  pharmacokinetic  data  for  the  IR  tablet  formulations  collected  in  those 
studies are included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, and in the pooled descriptive statistics 
of the non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters.  
The effect of intrinsic factors (race, gender, age, hepatic and renal impairment, CYP450 genotype) has 
been investigated by the applicant.  
Multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted to 
evaluate  the  effect  of  other  compounds  on  vortioxetine  as  well  as  the  effect  of  vortioxetine  on  other 
compounds.  
Two  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  have  been  performed  for  vortioxetine:  one  analysis  used 
data from 26 clinical pharmacology studies and a second analysis was performed on the more sparse 
pharmacokinetic  data  that  were  obtained  in  patients  with  Major  Depressive  Disorder  (MDD)  or 
Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder  (GAD)  in  12  phase  II/III  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  studies. 
Subsequently,  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  analyses  were  conducted  to  assess  the 
relationships between exposure and efficacy/tolerability for vortioxetine in patients with MDD. 
The  analytical  methods  used  to  analyse  vortioxetine  and  its  major  metabolites  have  been  well 
described. Justification for the absence of ISR in pivotal Studies 10272 and 11492A has been provided 
based  on  the  document  ‘Questions  &  Answers:  Positions  on  specific  questions  addressed  to  the 
pharmacokinetics  working  party’  (EMA/618604/2008  Rev.  7).    It  was  concluded  that  all  bioanalytical 
methods used were reliable for the detection of the compounds of interest.

Absorption 
Vortioxetine  is  highly  soluble  in  aqueous  media.  Taking  into  account  the  high  intestinal  permeability 
suggested  by  the  mass  balance  study,  vortioxetine  could  be  categorized  as  a  Class  I  (highly  soluble, 
highly permeable) drug according to the BCS classification system. 
Vortioxetine is slowly absorbed after oral administration of IR tablets or solution. Following single and 
multiple oral doses of 5, 10, or 20mg (IR tablets), median tmax values of 7 to 11 hours were observed.  
The  reported  absolute  bioavailability  (BA)  was  approximately  75%.  The  administration  of  20  mg 
vortioxetine  did  not  have  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  gastric  emptying,  but  did  have  a 
statistically significant pro-kinetic effect on small intestinal transit and subsequent colon arrival (mean 
decrease  of  approximately  1  to  2  hours  depending  on  the  radioactive  marker  and  time  of 
measurement).  
Differences in AUC and tmax across studies are still within the acceptable ranges and these differences 
have no implications on the conclusions of the individual studies. 
Bioequivalence  (BE)  of  the  tablets  used  in  early  development  stage  as  well  as  in  the  pivotal  clinical 
studies and those intended for marketing could be considered demonstrated. In addition, no difference 
in absorption is expected for the different strengths of the to-be-marketed formulation. The food effect 
has  been  explored  during  two  studies  (of  which  two  with  the  formulation  intended  to  be  marketed); 
results indicated that there is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine. 
Distribution 
Following  single  and  multiple  doses  of  vortioxetine,  the  estimated  volume  of  distribution  (Vz/F)  is 
approximately  2500  to  3400  L,  which  indicates  extensive  extravascular  distribution  of  vortioxetine. 
Vortioxetine binds extensively (>98%) to plasma proteins in vitro and appears to be independent from 
the  plasma  concentrations.  In  addition,  ex  vivo  protein  binding  experiments  using  samples  from 
subjects with hepatic or renal impairment showed that no difference could be observed in comparison 
with healthy subjects.  
The in vitro plasma protein binding of Vortioxetine and Lu AA34443 in human plasma was investigated 
in Studies 12287 and 14179 and was found to be independent of concentration in the ranges of 10 to 
12000ng  free  base/mL  (Vortioxetine)  and  5  to  4500ng  free  base/mL  (Lu  AA34443).  At  steady  state, 
the  Cmax  in  humans  following  20mg  Vortioxetine  is  approximately    33  ng/mL  for  both  compounds. 
Therefore,  it  is  not  likely  that  the  binding  sites  are  saturated  at  these  concentrations  and, 
consequently, displacement of one of the compounds by the other, or by other drugs, is unlikely. 
Elimination 
The estimated total plasma clearance of vortioxetine was approximately 500 to 670 mL/min. The mean 
half-life was estimated to 60 to 70 hours following single and multiple doses of vortioxetine. Because of 
its long elimination half-life, the risk of PK interactions can persist for several days or even weeks after 
vortioxetine withdrawal. However, as vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for inhibition or 
induction, this is not a concern.   
The mass balance study indicated that the mean recovery of  14C-radioactivity was 85% in 360 hours, 
with approximately 59% excreted in the urine and 26% in faeces. Vortioxetine and radioactivity levels 
declined with similar rates. The extent of systemic exposure to vortioxetine, based upon mean AUC0-t, 
accounted  for  approximately  13%  of  the  total  exposure  to  radioactivity  in  plasma.  Furthermore,  the 
combined  extent  of  systemic  exposure  to  vortioxetine  and  Lu  AA34443  accounted  for  approximately 
27%  of  the  total  exposure  to  radioactivity  in  plasma.  Vortioxetine  is  extensively  metabolised  and  the 
major biotransformation pathway seem to be oxidation to the major metabolite, Lu AA34443 followed 
by glucuronic acid conjugation.  
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 35/159 
 
  
 
As  approximately  all  radioactivity  could  be  attributed  to  vortioxetine  and  the  identified  metabolites, 
there is no risk for unidentified metabolites potentially impairing the safety profile of vortioxetine. 
From  the  results  of  the  mass  balance  study  it  is  clear  that  the  pathway  leading  to  Lu  AA34443  and 
subsequently  to  its  glucuronide  is  by  far  the  major  one.  The  three  other  pathways  are  minor  ones, 
contributing to only 3% of the metabolism of vortioxetine. 
A  large  number  of  enzymes  (CYP3A4/5,  CYP2C19,  CYP2C9,  CYP2A6,  CYP2C8,  and  CYP2B6)  can 
catalyse the clearance of vortioxetine in CYP2D6 PMs.  
In  vitro  experiments  indicated  that  several  CYP  isoenzymes  are  involved  in  the  metabolism  of 
vortioxetine:  CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6. Also UGT is playing a 
role in the conjugation reactions of vortioxetine metabolites.  
Genotyping  for  CYP2D6,  CYP2C9,  and  CYP2C19  alleles  was  performed  in  most  of  the  clinical 
pharmacology studies to evaluate the potential relationship between the inferred metabolic status and 
the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine. In general, although not consistent, the poor metabolisers (PMs) 
for  CYP2D6  showed  the  highest  AUC  values  for  vortioxetine  and  the  lowest  for  Lu  AA34443.  In 
addition,  a  47%  lower  CL/F  in  CYP2D6  PMs  than  in  Ems  (extensive  metaboliser)  has  been  observed. 
The  approximately  2-fold  higher  vortioxetine  exposure  in  CYP2D6  PMs  does  not  translate  into 
significant changes in the safety and tolerability profile of vortioxetine relative to that in CYP2D6 EMs 
according to the applicant. However, the frequency of some adverse effects is doubled in the PM group 
versus  EM  group,  like  for  dizziness  and  pruritus  and  the  DDI  study  with  bupropion  showed  a  higher 
incidence of adverse events due to the 2-fold higher vortioxetine exposure when bupropion was added 
to vortioxetine in steady state.  
It  is  the  Applicant’s  view  that  Vortioxetine  is  well  tolerated.  The  majority  of  the  adverse  events  were 
transient  and  mild  or  moderate.  A  subgroup  analysis  showed  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the 
tolerability profiles between the overall population and healthy subjects genotyped as CYP2D6 PMs or 
patients  categorised  as  low-clearance  patients  (covering  exposure  in  CYP2D6  PMs)  based  on  their 
pharmacokinetic  data.  The  incidences  of  nausea,  vomiting,  and  insomnia  were  not  higher  in  the 
subpopulations categorised as low clearance patients. 
Hence,  the  overall  dose  recommendations  in  the  product  information  seem  adequate,  that  is,  a 
recommended  dose  of  10mg  with  a  possibility  of  a  reduction  to  5mg  based  on  individual  patient 
response.  As  a  consequence,  CYP2D6  genotyping/phenotyping,  changes  in  titration,  or  therapeutic 
drug  monitoring  are  not  considered  to  be  of  clinical  relevance.  The  currently  recommended  dose 
regimen is considered both appropriate and manageable for the prescriber. 
In  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  in  healthy  subjects  (Population  Pharmacokinetics  of 
Vortioxetine  in  Healthy  Subjects  [PopPK  phase  I]),  the  oral  clearance  for  CYP2D6  ultra-rapid 
metabolizers  (UMs)  was  estimated  to  52.9L/h  compared  to  34.1L/h  for  CYP2D6  EMs,  which  gives  a 
ratio  of  1.55.  Consequently,  the  CYP2D6  UMs  will  have  a  36%  lower  Vortioxetine  exposure  than 
CYP2D6  EMs.  For  a  starting  dose  of  10mg,  CYP2D6  UMs  will,  in  general,  still  have  exposure  levels 
above  those  expected  in  CYP2D6  EMs  following  the  therapeutic  dose  of  5mg  Vortioxetine.  The  CHMP 
agreed that in CYP2D6 UMs, the exposure levels are still sufficient for an adequate efficacy. Concerning 
safety,  an  analysis  of  tolerability  versus  exposure  in  the  MDD  Short-term  studies  was  conducted 
dividing  the  patients  into  3  groups  based  on  their  clearance  of  Vortioxetine.  High-clearance  patients 
were  defined  as  the  10%  of  patients  with  the  lowest  exposure  (covering  exposure  in  UMs)  and  their 
overall tolerability was the same as the other groups of metabolisers.  
No  clinically  significant  changes  in  exposure  are  observed  in  relation  with  the  CYP2C19  and  CYP2C9 
inferred metabolic status.

Dose and time dependency 
There was an approximately dose-proportional increase in AUC and Cmax, over the range of single dose 
2.5 – 75 mg/day and multiple dose 2.5 – 60 mg/day both in single dose as in multiple dose settings. 
The accumulation index (AI) for vortioxetine (based on AUC0-24h) was estimated to be 5 to 6 following 
multiple  doses  of  5  to  20  mg/day,  which  is  consistent  with  its  long  half-life.  Steady  state  is  reached 
after approximately 12 days of once daily administration of vortioxetine. No time dependency has been 
observed for the other pharmacokinetic parameters of vortioxetine. 
Variability 
The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine are characterised by a moderate inter-individual and a low intra-
individual variability. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population and population PK studies  
Two population pharmacokinetic analyses have been performed using data from healthy subjects and 
from patients with MDD or GAD. The goal of the analysis was to develop a population pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  and  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  models  (efficacy/safety)  for  vortioxetine 
following oral administration of 1- 20 mg doses of vortioxetine in patients with MDD and GAD.  
In  the  PopPK/PD  phase  III,  in  patients,  the  final  covariate  model  included  height  and  creatinine 
clearance as significant covariates for the oral clearance. However, the effect on the pharmacokinetics 
of Vortioxetine was not considered clinically relevant. Region for study conduct (Europe, United States, 
or  rest  of  the  world  [RoW])  was  a  significant  covariate  for  the  oral  clearance.  The  oral  clearance 
estimate,  its  inter-individual  variability,  and  frequency  of  samples  below  the  lower  limit  of 
quantification  (LLOQ)  were  higher  in  the  United  States  than  in  Europe  and  in  the  RoW  (Population 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis of Vortioxetine in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder 
or  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder).  In  addition,  the  proportion  of  samples  with  non-quantifiable 
concentrations (below the LLOQ) were 3%, 15%, and 5% in Europe, the United States, and the RoW, 
respectively. 
According  to  the  applicant,  these  findings  cannot  be  explained  by  differences  in  demographic  factors 
(weight, BMI, or CrCL) and indicate a higher rate of non-compliance in studies conducted in the United 
States  compared  to  those  conducted  in  Europe  or  RoW.  In  contrast,  in  the  phase  I  population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis,  region  was  not  identified  as  a  significant  covariate,  which  further  support 
that the regional difference found in patients is most likely due to the less controlled study conditions 
in the patient studies. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine was similar in 
healthy subjects and in patients with MDD or GAD.

Special populations 
● Renal impairment 
Vortioxetine is almost completely cleared by metabolism. According to the results from study 112, the 
effects of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, or ESRD) on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine 
after single dose are not considered clinically meaningful. The CHMP agrees that the observed effects 
of  renal  impairment  on the  pharmacokinetics  of  vortioxetine  after  single dose  are  not  altered  to  such 
an extent that the dosage should be adjusted.   
With  regard  to  the  significant  accumulation  of  vortioxetine,  the  applicant  has  justified the  choice  of a 
single dose to study renal impairment and has discussed the potential consequences of a multiple dose 
vortioxetine  administration  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  The  applicant’s  answer  was  endorsed. 
According  to  the  EMA  Guidelines  on  the  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  medicinal  products  in 
patients with impaired hepatic and renal functions,  a single dose study is sufficient when the product 
exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics.  
There  is  an  accumulation  ratio  index  of  5  to  6  following  multiple  doses  of  5  to  20  mg/day  for 
vortioxetine AUC0-24h but this does not lead to a time-dependent PK as the parameters CL and Vss do 
not change with time. This accumulation ratio is added in section 5.2. The differences in exposure after 
single  dose  are  low  and  no  clinically  relevant  differences  are  expected  after  multiple  dose 
administration. 
● Hepatic impairment  
Even though vortioxetine is extensively metabolised, no clinically meaningful effect of mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment was observed on the pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine after single dose. 
The  applicant  has  correctly  justified  the  choice  of  a  single  dose  study  and  discussed  the  potential 
consequences of a multiple dose vortioxetine administration in patients with hepatic impairment.  
The  extent  of  effects  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  main  metabolites  are,  somewhat,  lesser  than 
expected. However, the effects of hepatic impairment on vortioxetine are not in line with the results of 
the other studies of the pharmacology program. The mass balance study implied elimination by almost 
complete  hepatic  metabolisation  and  renal  excretion  of  the  metabolites.  Consequently  an  increase  of 
the  extent  of  exposure  for  vortioxetine  would  have  been  expected,  but  the  AUC  and  Cmax  remain 
unchanged  or  are  slightly  even  lowered  for  both  hepatic  impairment  groups.  The  Applicant 
acknowledges that the lack of influence of hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine 
and  the  metabolites  Lu  AA39835  and  Lu  AA34443  may  appear  unexpected.  There  is  no  obvious 
explanation for the lack of increase in Vortioxetine exposure in the hepatic impairment groups. 
The  severity  of  hepatic  impairment  has  been  adequately  described  by  the  applicant  in  the  context  of 
Child-Pugh  score  for  subjects  included  in  study  114.  There  was  no  obvious  correlation  between  the 
pharmacokinetic parameters and the Child-Pugh score. 
The patients with severe hepatic impairment were not studied. In these patients, a clinically significant 
increase  of  exposure  to  vortioxetine  and/or  their  metabolites  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Caution  should  be 
exercised  when  prescribing  to  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.    This  is  well  mentioned  in 
sections 4.2, 4.4,  of the SmPC and section 5.2 of the SmPC.

● Gender  
Gender  differences  exist  in  the  PK  of  antidepressants  in  men  and  women.  Reduced  expression  and 
inhibition of many of the phase I enzymes necessary for the metabolism of antidepressants has been 
shown  to  result  in  higher  serum  levels  of  antidepressants  in  women.  In  terms  of  physiological 
differences, women have a generally lower body weight and organ size and a higher percentage of fat, 
factors which are known to affect distribution.  
In  study  n°10467,  the  exposure  to  vortioxetine  seemed  to  be  slightly  higher  in  women  than  in  men 
following multiple doses of 40mg/day but the results are inconclusive based on the limited data from 
this  study.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  small  differences  in  exposure  to  vortioxetine  may  be 
attributed to the difference in body weight between men and women (men weights ranged from 62 to 
105  kg  compared  to  47  to  85  kg  for  women)  and  this  gender-related  difference  was  no  longer 
significant after weight correction.  
In  study  CPH-001,  there  were  no  consistent  differences  in  the  exposure  or  CLr  between  male  and 
female  subjects.  In  study  n°111,  following  single  doses,  the  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  of  Vortioxetine  were 
18%  and  16%  higher,  respectively,  in  women  than  in  men.  Following  multiple  doses,  the  AUC0-24h 
and Cmax of Vortioxetine were 27% and 24% higher, respectively, in women than in men.  
In  the  phase  I  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  sex  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  the  final 
model.  The  modest,  sex-related  increases  in  Vortioxetine    exposure  in  Study  111  are  not  considered 
clinically meaningful by the applicant.  
It  can  be  concluded that no  clinically  relevant  changes  related  to  sex  were observed  for  vortioxetine, 
neither  in  the  non-compartmental  studies,  neither  in  the  POP  PK  analysis.    The  modest,  sex-related 
increases in Vortioxetine exposure in Study 111 are not considered clinically meaningful.  
● Race 
Since CYP2D6 is the main isoform responsible for the metabolism of vortioxetine and the prevalence of 
the  various  phenotypes  and  genotypes  are  different  among  different  ethnic  groups  (African,  Hispanic 
and  Asian  populations),  the  possible  effects  of  race  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vortioxetine  were 
considered.  
In study n°111, following multiple doses, the AUC0-24h and Cmax of Vortioxetine were 25% and 33% 
higher, respectively, in Black subjects than in White subjects. 
In study n° 12260A, following multiple doses, AUC0-24h and Cmax of Vortioxetine were slightly higher 
(8% and 9%, respectively) in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects. 
The  CHMP  agrees  that  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  Vortioxetine    exposure  related  to  race  or 
ethnicity  were  observed  in  Study  n°12260A  (Asian  population)  and  in  study  n°111  (black  versus 
white).  
However,  when  we  compare  the  PK  parameters  across  studies  of  the  both  phase  I  ascending  dose 
studies CPH001 and 10272, carried out respectively in Japanese healthy subjects and in a majority of 
Caucasians (46 except 3 Asian and 5 Black men), a higher exposure (1.6 fold) is observed in Japanese 
subjects  after  20  mg  single  dose.  The  applicant  justifies  this  observation  by  the  considerable 
differences in body weights among subjects (in Study 10272 body weights varied between 60 and 100 
kg, in Study CPH-001 values ranged between 51 and 79 kg).  
The phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that race or ethnicity (including Japanese 
versus  non-Japanese,  Black  versus  non-Black,  and  Hispanic  versus  non-Hispanic)  did  not  have  any 
significant  impact  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Vortioxetine  (PopPK  phase  I).  No  clinically  meaningful 
changes in Vortioxetine  exposure related to race or ethnicity were observed.

● Body weight  
According  to  the  phase  I  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  body  size  does  not  have  any  clinically 
meaningful effect on the exposure to Vortioxetine.  
Since  Vortioxetine    is  lipophilic  and  has  a  large  volume  of  distribution,  the  applicant  discussed  the 
clinical  relevance  of  the  influence  of  body  weight  on  vortioxetine  clearance,  exposure  and  volume  of 
distribution.  
In  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  in  healthy  subjects  (Population  Pharmacokinetics  of 
Vortioxetine    in  Healthy  Subjects  [PopPK  phase  I]),  central  volume  of  distribution  was  significantly 
related  with  height,  weight,  and  lean  body  mass  (LBM),  but  not  with  BMI.  Oral  clearance  was 
significantly  related  with  height.  In  the  final  population  pharmacokinetic  model,  only  the  relationship 
between height and volume of distribution remained in the model. Since weight, LBM, and height are 
all  heavily  correlated,  especially  for  subjects  participating  in  phase  I  studies  with  narrow  inclusion 
ranges, the inclusion of the most significant of them in the model often leaves the other ones out. The 
central volume of distribution increased with 17L for every cm increase in height. For Subject A, with a 
height of 155cm, and Subject B, with a height of 187cm, the model predicted V2 values of 1760 and 
2320L,  respectively.  In  terms  of  exposure,  Subject  A  will  have  a  5%  higher  Cmax  and  AUC0-24h  at 
steady  state  than  the  population  mean  (the  average  subject).  Subject  B  will  have  a  4%  lower  Cmax 
and  AUC0-24h  than  the  population  mean.  The  impact  of  height,  weight,  and/or  LBM  on  the  central 
volume of distribution, and thereby on exposure, is not considered clinically relevant. 
In 
the 
final  population  pharmacokinetic  model 
for  patients  with  MDD/GAD  (Population 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis of Vortioxetine in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder 
or  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  [PopPK/PD  phase  III]),  a  significant  relationship  was  found  between 
height  and  oral  clearance.  Relative  to  a  typical  patient  with  a  height  of  166cm,  patients  are  not 
expected to have greater than a ±17% difference in exposure to Vortioxetine at steady state over the 
range evaluated (153 to 184cm), based on a simulated dose of 10mg/day of Vortioxetine. 
Hence,  as  assessed  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses,  both  in  healthy  subjects  and  in 
patients with MDD/GAD, the impact of height, weight, and/or LBM on the central volume of distribution 
and oral clearance, and thereby on exposure, is not considered clinically relevant. Based on this, it can 
be concluded that the benefit/risk is unchanged in these groups. 
In general, there was very good agreement between the pharmacokinetic parameter values estimated 
by population pharmacokinetic analysis and those estimated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). 
Following single and multiple doses of Vortioxetine, the volume of distribution (Vz/F) was estimated to 
approximately 2500 to 3400L using NCA. The extensive distribution of Vortioxetine was confirmed in 
the phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis, in which the sum of the volumes of distribution in the 
central (V2/F) and peripheral (V3/F) compartments was approximately 2600L. Using NCA, the 
estimated CL/F of Vortioxetine was approximately 30 to 40L/h and the t½ was estimated to 60 to 70 
hours following single or multiple doses of Vortioxetine. In the phase I population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, the overall population mean CL/F was estimated to 33L/h and the t½ was 66 hours. The 
applicant’s argumentation is mainly based on the population PK model in volunteers and patients with 
MDD/GAD and can be considered as sufficient to conclude that the impact of height and weight on the 
central volume of distribution is not considered clinically relevant. 
● Age 
Antidepressants being among the most commonly prescribed medicinal products for older agents, age-
related changes in drug PK parameters should be adequately investigated. In general, PK changes that 
accompany aging result in higher and more variable plasma drug concentrations.

For  vortioxetine,  Cmax  was  23%  higher  and  AUC0-24h  was  27%  higher  in  elderly  than  in  young 
subjects  on  day  28  in  study  n°111.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  non-compartmental  studies  and  the 
phase  I  population  PK  analysis,  the  modest  age-related  increases  in  Vortioxetine  exposure,  are  not 
considered clinically meaningful by the applicant. 
However,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  a  stratification  based  on  age  to  evaluate  the  impact  of 
age  on  PK  parameters  in  the  three  ranges  of  age  (65-74),  (75-84)  and  85+  and  to  provide  the 
proportion  of  very  elderly  (>  85  –year  old)  subjects.  As  no  data  was  available  on  this  population,  it 
was  asked  to  add  in  the  SmPC  that  caution  should  especially  be  done  when  vortioxetine  is 
administered in patients of more than 85 years of age.  
In  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  in  healthy  subjects  (Population  Pharmacokinetics  of 
Vortioxetine  in  Healthy  Subjects  [PopPK  phase  I]),  age  was  treated  as  a  continuous  covariate  and  a 
significant  relation  was  found  between  CL/F  and  age.  For  every  year  increase  in  age,  CL/F  decreased 
by 0.28L/h. No healthy subjects >85 years were included in the clinical pharmacology studies.  
Four  patients  >85  years  (3  women,  1  man)  received  5  or  10  mg/day  Vortioxetine  in  the  short-term 
placebo-controlled  studies.  In  these  patients,  treatment  was  well  tolerated  and  none  of  them 
prematurely  discontinued  treatment  or  reported  serious  adverse  events  during  the  study. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  are available  for  two  of  the  patients,  both  receiving  5mg/day  Vortioxetine.  Due 
to  the  limited  data  available,  the  impact  of  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  cannot  be  evaluated  for 
patients >85 years. For information, the individual CL/F values in these 2 patients were 14 and 21L/h. 
The  Product  information  reflects  in  section  5.2  the  following:  In  elderly  healthy  subjects  (aged  ≥65 
years;  n=20),  the  exposure  to  vortioxetine  increased  up  to  27%  (Cmax  and  AUC)  compared  to  young 
healthy control subjects (aged ≤45 years) after multiple doses of 10 mg/day. The lowest effective dose 
of  5 mg  vortioxetine  once  daily  should  always  be  used  as  starting  dose  in  patient’s  ≥  65  years  (see 
section 4.2). However, caution should be exercised when prescribing to elderly patients at doses higher 
than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily 
Section 4.2 also reflects the following statement: Caution is advised when treating patients’ ≥ 65 years 
of age with doses higher than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily for which data are limited  
No pharmacokinetic studies in children have been carried out. BRINTELLIX is not recommended for the 
treatment  of  depression  in  patients  under  18  years  of  age  since  safety  and  efficacy  of  BRINTELLIX 
have not been established in this age group. 
An agreed-upon Paediatric Investigational Plan for vortioxetine is in place (PIP number: EMEA-000455-
PIP02-10-M01).  
● Metabolic status 
Genotyping  for  CYP2D6,  CYP2C9  and  CYP2C19  alleles  was  performed  in  most  of  the  clinical 
pharmacology studies to evaluate the potential relationship between the inferred metabolic status and 
the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine, since these three CYP isozymes are involved in the metabolism of 
vortioxetine.    
There is no specific PK study comparing the PK profiles in CYP2D6 poor and extensive metabolisers. A 
potential  effect  of  inferred  metabolic  status  for  CYP2D6,  CYP2C19,  and  CYP2C9  was  assessed  in  the 
phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis. The approximately 2-fold higher Vortioxetine  exposure in 
CYP2D6 PMs does not translate into clinically significant changes in the safety and tolerability profile of 
Vortioxetine relative to that in CYP2D6 EMs (see discussion above).

Drug-drug Interactions 
Vortioxetine is  metabolized  by  multiple  cytochrome P-450s  and  has  little inhibition  or induction  effect 
on  the  CYP  system.  Vortioxetine  has  therefore  a  low  potential  for  clinically  relevant  interactions  with 
other drugs.   
Effect of other compounds on the Pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine 
For  bupropion  (Study  117),  rifampicin  (Study  115),  ketoconazole,  and  fluconazole  (for  AUC  only) 
(Study 103), the 90% CIs for Cmax and AUC were outside the limits of 80% to 125%.  
The  approximately  2-fold  increase  in  Vortioxetine  exposure  following  co-administration  with  a  strong 
CYP2D6 inhibitor (bupropion) is comparable to the higher exposure in CYP2D6 PMs, relative to CYP2D6 
Ems. These observations are reflected in the SmPC where it is mentioned that depending on individual 
patient  response,  a  lower  dose  of  vortioxetine  may  be  considered  if  strong  inhibitors  are  added  to 
vortioxetine treatment.  
According to the guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev1 –Corr*, 
if  the  interaction  study  with  the  strong  inhibitor  results  in  a  marked  effect  on  the  exposure  of  the 
investigational  drug,  potentially  leading  to  dose  adjustments,  an  additional  study  with  a  moderate 
inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  is  recommended  in  order  to  support  the  evaluation  of  the  need  for  specific 
treatment  recommendations  for  other  inhibitors  of  the  enzyme.  In  this  context,  the  applicant  was 
asked  to  discuss  the  necessity  to  include  the  moderate  CYP2D6  inhibitors  in  the  recommendations  in 
section 4.2. The CHMP agrees with the applicant’s answer that the interaction study with the strongest 
CYP2D6  inhibitor  bupropion  does  not  result  in  a  marked  effect  on  the  exposure  of  the  investigational 
drug:  AUC0-24h  was  2.3-fold  higher  and  Cmax  was  2.1-fold  higher  following  co-administration  with 
bupropion.  To  be  noted,  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Drug  Interactions, 
CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.  1  Corr*,  June  2012,  Appendix  VIII,  a  strong  inhibitor  causes  a  >  5  fold 
increase in the plasma AUC values or ≥ 80% decrease in oral clearance, a moderate inhibitor causes a 
>  2  fold  increase  in  the  plasma  AUC  or  50-≤80%  inhibition  of  oral  clearance, a  mild  inhibitor  causes 
1.25 to 2 fold increase in the plasma AUC or ≤ 50% inhibition of oral clearance. For information, the 
US FDA recommends dosage adjustments if there is a ≥ 2-fold increase in AUC.  
The  applicant  mentioned  adequately  in  the  SmPC  section  4.2  that  depending  on  individual  patient 
response,  a  lower  dose  of  Brintellix  may  be  considered  if  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  (e.g.  bupropion, 
quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) are added to Brintellix treatment.  
Rifampicin induces CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9, which results in the formation of metabolites other 
than  Lu  AA39835  and  Lu  AA34443  and  in  a  reduction  of  the  Vortioxetine  concentration.  Lu  AA39835 
and  Lu  AA34443  are  mainly  formed  by  CYP2D6,  which  is  a  non-inducible  enzyme.  The  decreasing 
exposure  to  these  metabolites  is  caused  by  the  reduced  amount  of  Vortioxetine  available  for 
metabolism to Lu AA39835 and Lu AA34443. 
An  increase  in  Lu  AA39835  concentration  following  fluconazole  inhibition  (CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  and 
CYP3A4) is expected, since CYP2C9 only plays a minor role in the formation of Lu AA39835 and since 
the  Vortioxetine  concentration  increases  30  to  40%  due  to  inhibition  of  other  metabolic  pathways 
dependent  on  CYP3A4,  CYP2C19,  or  CYP2C9.  The  higher  concentrations  of  Vortioxetine  are  then 
metabolised  by  the  major  enzyme  catalyzing  the  formation  of  Lu  AA39835,  that  is,  the  uninhibited 
CYP2D6 enzyme, which results in higher concentrations of Lu AA39835. 
In conclusion, the results of the CYP induction and inhibition studies are expected and the metabolism 
of Vortioxetine is considered to be well understood.

The  combined  treatment  with  antidepressant  and  antiepileptic  drugs  is  frequently  reported  in  both 
neurologic and psychiatric practice. Antiepileptics like carbamazepine and phenytoin are also inducers. 
Drug  inducers  such  as  carbamazepine  may  theoretically  increase  vortioxetine  clearance,  being 
metabolized  by  CYP3A4.    Phenytoin  being  CYP2C9  inducer,  it  can  also  theoretically  increase 
vortioxetine clearance, being partly metabolized by CYP2C9.  
Even  if  not  anticipated  by  the  applicant,  a  DDI  could  not  be  excluded  with  these  other  antiepileptic 
inducers. Therefore, as required by the RAP, the applicant proposes adequately to add carbamazepine 
and phenytoin in section 4.5 and in section 4.2.  
Co-administration of vortioxetine with multiple doses of a CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor (ketoconazole) 
or  a  CYP2C19,  CYP2C9,  and  CYP3A4/5  inhibitor  (fluconazole)  led  to  increases  of  30%  and  46%  for 
AUC0-t  and  26%  and  15%  for  Cmax  of  vortioxetine,  respectively.  Ketoconazole  and  fluconazole,  two 
antifungal  agents,  are  potent  inhibitors  of  CYP3A  and  CYP2C9/C19  enzyme  subtypes,  respectively. 
Administration of ketoconazole results in significant interaction with drugs metabolized by CYP3A and is 
generally  recommended  as  an  inhibitory  probe  for  that  enzyme.  Its  investigation  is  therefore  fully 
endorsed.  In  the  same  way,  fluconazole  is  an  adequate  inhibitory  probe  for  CYP2C9.  The  applicant 
mentions correctly in section 4.5. of the SmPC that when vortioxetine was co-administered following 6 
days  of  ketoconazole  400  mg/day,  a  1.3-fold  increase  in  vortioxetine  AUC  was  observed  and  that  no 
dose  adjustment  is  needed.  The  same  statement  is  added  for  the  co-administration  of  fluconazole 
200mg/day with a 1.5-fold increase in AUC.  
CYP2C19  is  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  several  important  groups  of  drugs  including  many  proton 
pump  inhibitors.  The  DDI  study  with  omeprazole  (CYP2C19  inhibitor  and  substrate)  indicates 
adequately that its co-administration with vortioxetine does not affect the PK of vortioxetine.  
No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  following  co-administration  of  aspirin  and  vortioxetine. 
Co-administration of a single dose of ethanol had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine. 
In vivo results demonstrating an absence of interaction should only be mentioned in section 4.5 if this 
is  of  major  importance  to  the  prescriber.    As  required  by  RAP,  the  absence  of  effect  of  omeprazole 
(CYP2C19  inhibitor),  aspirin  and  ethanol  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vortioxetine  has  been  added  in 
section 4.5 (Potential for other medicinal products to affect vortioxetine).  
Effect of Vortioxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of other Compounds 
No  substantial  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  cocktail  components  (caffeine,  tolbutamide, 
dextromethorphan, and midazolam) was observed following multiple doses of 10mg/day Vortioxetine. 
This  indicates  that  Vortioxetine  is  not  an  inhibitor  or  inducer  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2D6,  or 
CYP3A4/5. This simultaneous administration of a mixture of substrates of multiple CYP enzymes in one 
study  (i.e.  cocktail  approach)  to  evaluate  the drug’s  inhibition or  induction  potential  is  adequate.  The 
negative  results  observed  for  this  study  eliminate  the  need  for  further  evaluation  of  particular  CYP 
enzymes.  Moreover,  co-administration  of  multiple  doses  of  vortioxetine  and  warfarin  confirms  that 
Vortioxetine  is  not  an  inhibitor  or  inducer  of  CYP2C9,  as  already  observed  in  the  “cocktail  approach” 
study.  
The  DDI  study  with  diazepam  (CYP2C19  substrate)  indicates  adequately  that  Vortioxetine  is  not  an 
inhibitor  or  inducer  of  CYP2C19  either.  Co-administration  of  multiple  doses  of  Vortioxetine  with 
omeprazole,  CYP2C19  substrate  and  inhibitor,  had  no  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  omeprazole, 
confirming that Vortioxetine is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP2C19. 
Co-administration of Vortioxetine is not anticipated to have an impact on the efficacy of the COC.

The  effects  of  vortioxetine  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ethanol,  aspirin,  and  lithium  have  also  been 
evaluated.  No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  following  co-administration  of  these  drugs 
and Vortioxetine. 
The potential for drug interactions with metabolites of vortioxetine has been investigated. In vitro, the 
metabolites  did  not  show  any  potential  for  clinically  meaningful  CYP  inhibition  for  any  of  the  CYP 
isozymes  tested  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  and 
CYP3A4/5). In addition, the major metabolite Lu AA34443 did not induce CYP enzyme activity in vitro 
for  any  of  the  CYP  isozymes  tested  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  and 
CYP3A4/5). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of vortioxetine responsible for its antidepressant effect is based on preclinical 
studies. In vitro studies indicate that vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 
a 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and an inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter. 
Thus,  the  mechanism  of  action  of  vortioxetine  is  thought  to  be  a  combination  of  2  pharmacological 
modes of action: direct modulation of receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin transporter. 
In  humans,  two  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  studies  have  been  conducted  using  5-HT 
transporter  ligands  (11C-MADAM  or  11C-DASB)  to  quantify  the  5-HT  transporter  occupancy  in  the 
brain  across  different  dose  levels.  The  mean  5-HT  transporter  occupancy  in  the  raphe  nuclei  was 
approximately 50%  at 5 mg/day, 65%   at 10 mg/day and increased to above 80% [lower limit 95% 
CI; upper limit 95% CI] at 20 mg/day.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
• Primary pharmacodynamics 
The  primary  pharmacodynamics  of  vortioxetine  are  poorly  understood  since  the  observations  from  in 
vitro and animal studies could not be replicated in humans.  
Pharmacodynamic  biomarkers  such  as  serotonin  in  platelets,  whole  blood  and  CSF,  serum  cortisol, 
serum  prolactin,  body  temperature,  and  pupil  size  were  explored  to  investigate  the  effects  of 
vortioxetine on the 5-HT1A receptor and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT). Some inconclusive effects 
were observed, without a clear dose dependency. 
In  humans,  two  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  studies  have  been  conducted  using  5-HT 
transporter ligands (11C-MADAM or 11C-DASB) to quantify the 5-HT transporter occupancy in the brain 
across  different  dose  levels.  The  mean  5-HT  transporter  occupancy  in  the  raphe  nuclei  was 
approximately 50% (40-70% range) at 5 mg/day, 65% (31-83% range)  at 10 mg/day and increased 
to above 80% (71-97% range) at 20 mg/day.  
• Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In  pharmacodynamic  studies  using  healthy  subjects,  vortioxetine  10  and  40  mg  did  not  have  a 
clinically  meaningful  effect  on  cardiac  repolarisation.  Vortioxetine  did  not  impair  on-the-road  driving 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 44/159 
 
 
  
 
performance,  nor  impair  the  cognitive  function  or  psychomotor  skills  in  healthy  subjects  using  a 
battery of pharmacodynamic tests assessing various cognitive domains.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacodynamic  profile  of  vortioxetine  has  been  thoroughly  investigated,  however  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  antidepressants  is  not  well  established  and  validated  biomarkers  are  lacking. 
Shortcomings  in  our  basic  knowledge  of  the  mechanisms  underlying  changes  in  binding  potential 
currently  impede  the  application  of  PET  scans  to  measure  regional  changes  in  endogenous 
neurotransmitters, evoked by challenges that could alter synaptic neurotransmitter concentration. 
Hence, the mode of action of vortioxetine remains largely elusive. 
Vortioxetine  had  no  influence  on  driving  performance  in  healthy  young  subjects.  However,  whether 
vortioxetine affects driving performance in depressed patients, in particular upon long-term treatment, 
is currently unknown. 
The  panel  of  clinical  drug-drug  interactions  (DDI  studies)  investigating  the  potential  effects  of 
vortioxetine on the pharmacokinetics of other compounds and conversely the potential effects of other 
compounds on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine is detailed and adapted.  
Because of its long elimination half-life, the risk of PK interactions can persist for several days or even 
weeks after vortioxetine withdrawal. However, as vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for 
inhibition or induction, this is not a concern.   
Investigation  of  transporters  involved  in  drug  elimination  are  indicated  if  available,  and  in  vivo  data 
shows  that  active  renal,  biliary  or  gut  wall  secretion  of  unchanged  drug  is  involved  in  a  main  part  of 
the drug elimination and thus modulation of the transporter involved may be of clinical relevance.  
Hepatic or biliary secretions as well as the renal secretion are well below 25% of the total clearance for 
vortioxetine.  In  the  mass  balance  study,  unchanged  vortioxetine  represents  a  minor  part  of  the  total 
AUC  of  radioactivity.  Vortioxetine  is  extensively  metabolised  and  two  metabolites  are  excreted  in 
considerable  amounts;  Lu AA34443  which  was  excreted in  both  urine  and  faeces,  and  its  glucuronide 
conjugate (M4(b)) which was excreted in urine.  The identification of transporters is also not relevant 
for Lu AA34443 for which the contribution to the in vivo pharmacological effect is non-existent.  
Since the conjugation reactions only involve the Vortioxetine metabolites, which are pharmacologically 
inactive,  and  not  Vortioxetine  itself,  inhibition  of  UGT  will  have  no  effect  on  Vortioxetine  exposure. 
Therefore, an investigation of a potential UGT-based interaction will have no clinical relevance. 
Some  antipsychotics/neuroleptics,  particularly  phenothiazines,  may  competitively  inhibit  the  CYP2D6-
mediated metabolism of vortioxetine, potentially raising its plasma concentrations. The potential for PK 
interactions  with  relevant  antipsychotic  drugs  was  asked  to  be  discussed  from  a  mechanistic 
perspective and the need not to conduct formal studies justified. The applciant’s answer is endorsed: in 
CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers, the Vortioxetine exposure was moderately (2-fold) increased following 
inhibition  by  the  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitor  bupropion  (Study  117).  The  Vortioxetine  exposure  seen 
following co-administration with bupropion was similar to that observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. 
Thus, administration of any CYP2D6 inhibitor can maximally result in a 2-fold increase in Vortioxetine 
exposure.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  does  not  consider  it  relevant  to  conduct  formal  studies  with 
antipsychotic/neuroleptics that may inhibit the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of Vortioxetine. 
Patients  with  depression  refractory  to  treatment  with  a  single  agent  are  sometimes  tried  on 
combination  therapy.  The  potential  for  PK  interactions  with  other  relevant  antidepressant  drugs  (i.e. 
paroxetine,  fluoxetine  and  sertraline  as  potent/moderate  CYP2D6  inhibitors…)  was  asked  to  be 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 45/159 
 
  
 
discussed from a mechanistic perspective and clear recommendations have been provided in the SmPC 
with  regard  to  combination  therapy.    The  SmPC,  section  4.2,  also  include  the  possibility  of  dose 
reduction  with  regards  to  combination  therapy  with  potent  CYP2D6  inhibitors.    In  addition  to 
bupropion,  the  applicant  has  mentioned  an  exhaustive  list  of  the  potent  CYP2D6  inhibitors  in  section 
4.2 and 4.5. (quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, terbinafine, ritonavir, cinacalcet…).  
In addition to rifampicin, the other strong inducers of the CYPs involved in the vortioxetine metabolism 
were cited in section 4.5 of SmPC. 
According  to  the  guideline  on  SmPC,  in  vivo  results  demonstrating  an  absence  of  interaction  should 
only be mentioned in section 4.5 if this is of major importance to the prescriber.  The absence of effect 
of  omeprazole  (CYP2C19  inhibitor),  aspirin  and  ethanol  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vortioxetine  were 
added in section 4.5 (Potential for other medicinal products to affect vortioxetine).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  vortioxetine  have  been  investigated  in  two  positron 
emission tomography (PET) studies investigating the occupancy of the 5-HT transporter and/or the 5-
HT1A receptor (Studies 10985 and 12260A) and one study assessing neurotransmitter concentrations 
in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; Study 124).  
The  secondary  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  vortioxetine  have  been  investigated  in  studies  10272, 
10467, and 12260A. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been studied in thirteen studies including a study on cardiac 
repolarisation  (Study  104,  with  moxifloxacin)  and  driving  performance  (Study  12689A,  with 
mirtazapine).  
However, the pharmacodynamic studies performed with vortioxetine shed no light on its mechanism of 
action in humans in vivo.  
Vortioxetine is thought to target serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine but at present no biomarkers 
are  validated  to  study  the  effect  of  antidepressants.  Pharmacodynamic  parameters  were  studied  in 
small sample sets, the data of which are often statistically inconclusive due to very large variations. At 
this  stage,  it  is  not  possible  to  use  any  of  the  known  potential  biomarkers  to  predict  a  potential 
therapeutic effect of vortioxetine in patients with depression. 
For  most  of  the  other  exploratory,  pharmacodynamic  biomarkers,  some  effects,  without  a  clear  dose 
dependency,  were observed.  The  multimodal  effects  of  vortioxetine  acting  at  several  receptor targets 
and at the 5-HTT may complicate the interpretation of the responses from individual biomarkers as a 
particular effect, or lack of effect, might be due to the sum of several simultaneous pharmacodynamic 
responses. 
No  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic  interactions  were observed  following  co-
administration  of  Vortioxetine  with  aspirin,  warfarin,  oral  contraceptives,  or  the  CNS-active 
compounds alcohol, diazepam, or lithium.  
Vortioxetine  did  not  have  any  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  cardiac  repolarisation.  Vortioxetine  did 
not  impair  on-the-road  driving  performance,  the  cognitive  function  or  psychomotor  skills  in  healthy 
subjects.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  real  dose  finding  study  was  conducted.  A  dose  justification  was  acquired  from  the  short-term 
clinical studies supported by toxicological and pharmacological data. This was considered acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The main clinical documentation for vortioxetine consists of nine short-term studies (11492A, 11984A, 
305, 13267A, 315, 316, 303, 304, 12541A) including a placebo- and active controlled study in the ≥65 
years population (12541A). 
One  relapse  prevention  study  was  performed  for  the  evaluation  of  maintenance  of  effect  (11985A). 
Long-term effect was also studied in open label extensions of the short-term studies 11492A, 11984A, 
305, and 304.  
Additional studies were completed between MAA submission and 31 August 2013. 
Studies in children were not performed. 
The study design was similar for the initially sumitted short-term studies.

• 
Treatments 
In  short-term  clinical  studies  patients  were  treated  with  fixed  doses  of  Vortioxetine  encapsulated 
tablets: 1mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, 10 mg, 15mg and 20 mg (the doses varied across studies and can be found 
in table 1 above and in the detailed descriptions of the individual studies below), matching placebo, or, 
in  six  of  the  studies,  a  fixed  dose  of  the  active  reference  venlafaxine  capsules  75mg  and  150mg  i.e. 
225  mg/day  (Study  11492A)  or  duloxetine  capsules  60  mg/day  (studies  11984A,  13267A,  315,  304 
and 12541A).  
The  IMPs  were  encapsulated  tablets  (Vortioxetine)  or  overencapsulated  capsules  (venlafaxine; 
duloxetine; placebo). All IMPs were supplied as brownish red/orange capsules of identical appearance. 
The investigators were instructed to store the IMPs below 30°C. 
The medication was administered once daily, preferably in the morning, with or without food. The dose 
was taken orally, with a glass of water. 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the short-term studies was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
fixed doses of LUAA21004 versus placebo in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). 
Study  12541A  was  a  dedicated  study  in  the  elderly  to  evaluate  the efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability of 
fixed doses of LUAA21004 versus placebo in elderly patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). 
Study  11985A  had  the  objective  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  Vortioxetine  (5  and  10  mg/day)  in  the 
prevention of relapse of major Depressive Episodes (MDE). 
The long-term extension studies had the objectives to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
flexible  doseses  of  Vortioxetine  over  a  period  of  52  weeks  in  patients  with  MDD  who  completed  the 
respective short-term studies.

They include the MADRS single-item scores, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score, 
which  is  used  to  assess  anxiety  symptoms,  the  proportions  of  responders  and  remitters,  and  the 
Clinical  Global  Impression  –Global  Improvement  (CGI-I)  score,
which  reflects  the  investigator’s 
global clinical judgement of the outcome of treatment. 
Additional variables were used to evaluate the effect of Vortioxetine on cognitive dysfunction, health-
related quality of life (HRQoL), and overall functioning. Cognitive dysfunction was evaluated using the 
neuropsychological tests RAVLT (a verbal learning and memory task), DSST (a task reliant on speed of 
processing, executive function and attention), and CPFQ (a patient-reported outcome [PRO]) designed 
to assess clinically relevant cognitive and physical symptoms associated with depression); HRQoL and 
overall functioning was evaluated using SF-36 domain scores, the Q-LES-Q (SF) total and single-item 
scores, the EQ-5D score, the HSQ-12 score, and the SDS total and single-item scores.  
• 
Statistical methods 
For each pivotal study, a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was prepared before the study was unblinded 
and before the data were analysed. 
Short-term studies 
All  the  analyses  in  adults  and  the  elderly  were  performed  on  the  full-  analysis-set  (FAS),  which  was 
defined  as  all  randomised  patients  who  took  at  least  one  dose  of  investigational  medicinal  product 
(IMP) and who had at least one valid post-baseline measurement of the primary efficacy variable. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  to  Week  6  or  8  in  MADRS  or  HAM-D24 
total score, and the statistical analysis was either a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis

using  observed  cases  (OC)  or  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  using  the  last  observation  carried 
forward (LOCF) (see table Primary efficacy analysis in short-term studies above).  
The MMRM analysis used OC and all the data from the Treatment Period. The model had a completely 
unstructured  covariance  matrix  and  included  terms  for  site,  baseline  score-by-visit  interaction,  and 
treatment-by-visit  interaction.  The  ANCOVA  used  the  LOCF,  with  treatment  and  site  as  fixed  factors 
and the baseline scale score as a covariate. The data for the patients treated with the active reference 
were kept in the models to improve the precision of the estimates. 
In each study, a hierarchically-ordered testing strategy was defined a priori in the SAP and comprised 
the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as the key secondary efficacy endpoints (see Table below Testing 
Strategies  in  short-term  studies).  The  testing  strategy  comprised  either  one  sequence  or  two 
sequences  tested  in  parallel.  The  testing  stopped  within  a  sequence  as  soon  as  a  hypothesis  in  the 
hierarchy could not be rejected. 
Hierarchical testing was used to control the 2-sided Type I error over the primary and key secondary 
endpoints.  When  the  testing  strategy  comprised  one  sequence  (Studies  11492A,305,  304,  and 
12541A),  each  step  in  the  sequence  was  tested  separately  versus  placebo  at  a  significance  level  of 
0.05; when the testing strategy comprised two parallel sequences (Studies 11984A, 13267A, 315, and 
316),  each  step  in  each  sequence  was  tested  separately  versus  placebo  at  a  Bonferroni-corrected 
significance  level  of  0.025.  In  Study  303,  the  testing  strategy  comprised  two  steps:  the  first  step 
comprised one sequence, with a single endpoint that was tested versus placebo at a significance level 
of 0.05; the second step comprised two parallel sequences, and each step in each sequence was tested 
separately versus placebo at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.025.  
In  the  studies  that  included  an  active  reference,  comparisons  of  the  active  reference  versus  placebo 
were performed outside the testing strategy, at a significance level of 0.05. 
For  endpoints  outside  the  testing  strategy,  or  endpoints  within  the  testing  strategy  that  were  not 
tested  because  the  procedure  had  stopped,  nominal  p-values  are  reported.  For  individual  short-term 
studies,  the  phrase  “separation  from  placebo”  is  used  to  describe  findings  with  a  nominal  p-value 
<0.05. For simplicity, in the tabulations of the secondary efficacy results, the p-values are designated 
as nominal, regardless of the results in the testing strategy. 
The endpoints (except for response and remission) in the testing strategy were all analysed using the 
same  methodology  as  that  used  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  The  results  for  response  and 
remission  were  based  on  logistic  regression  (LREG),  LOCF,  adjusting  for  the  baseline  score  and 
treatment,  with  p-values derived  from  odds  ratios. For  the  CGI-I,  the  baseline  CGI-S  score  was  used 
as  a  covariate.  In  addition,  Fisher’s  exact  test  and  χ2-tests  were  performed.  Sustained  response  was 
analysed in the same way. Time to event (that is, time to response, remission, or sustained response) 
was analysed using both a log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. 
Endpoints outside the testing strategy were analysed using the same methods as for endpoints 
within the testing strategy.

As sensitivity analysis, ANCOVA (LOCF) and MMRM were performed, applying the method that had not 
been  used  for  primary  analysis  (i.e.  ANCOVA  (LOCF)  primary  analysis  ->  MMRM  sensitivity  analysis, 
and  vice  versa).  Furthermore,  post-hoc  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  further  confirm  the 
robustness of the results; these included a placebo-mean imputation (PMI) analysis of the change from 
baseline  in  MADRS  total  score  and  LREG,  observed  cases  (OC)  and  non-response-imputation  (NRI) 
analyses of response and remission. 
For comparisons across studies and to support findings from the individual studies, side-by-side results 
from  each  study  together  with  results  from  a  meta-analysis  are  presented  (Forest  plots).  To  provide 
consistent input for the meta-analyses, a similar analysis approach was applied to all the studies.  The 
MMRM  was  chosen  as  the  main  analysis,  however,  analyses  based  on  ANCOVA,  LOCF  were  also 
performed. The PMI results were also used as input for meta-analyses. 
Since not all doses of Vortioxetine were included in all the studies, the meta- analysis approach (rather 
than  a  pooled  analysis  of  individual  patient  data)  was  considered  the  statistical  methodology  that 
would  provide  the  most  reliable  estimates  of  overall  treatment  effect.    The  meta-analyses  were 
performed  applying  standard  methodology  including  tests  for  heterogeneity  and  estimation  under 
random  effects  assumptions.  Heterogeneous  treatment  effects  were  also  assessed  by  evaluating  I². 
The  meta-analysis  is  a  transparent  analysis  as  it  is  possible  to  determine  which  studies  drive  the 
observed effect. 
Meta-analyses including all the short-term studies (except the dedicated study in the elderly, as it only 
included patients aged ≥65 years) were performed on the MADRS (total score and single items), CGI-I 
score,  HAM-A  (total  score  and  item  5),  SF-36  MCS  and  Physical  Component  Summary  scores,  SF-36 
domain  scores,  and  SDS  total  scores.  Meta-analyses  were  also  performed  for  the  subset  of  studies 
conducted  outside  the  United  States.    Pooled  analyses  (based  on  the  MADRS  total  score)  were  only 
performed on small subpopulations for which there were too few patients in the individual studies for 
analysis.

The  effect  of  treatment  with  Vortioxetine  on  cognitive  dysfunction  is  presented  from  three  different 
perspectives:  the  effect  in  neuropsychological  tests  (DSST  and  RAVLT)  as  objective  measures  of 
cognitive performance (study 12541A in the elderly only); the effect on the single items of the MADRS 
and HAM-A that address the aspect of cognitive symptoms as assessed by the clinician (MADRS item 6 
and  HAM-A  item  5,  respectively);  and  the  effect  on  subjective  self-ratings  of  cognitive  symptoms 
associated with depression using a patient-reported outcome (CPFQ) (study 316 only). 
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the results on the DSST and RAVLT, the standardised effect sizes 
were  calculated  based  on  an  ANCOVA,  LOCF.  To  evaluate  the  effect  in  patients  with  significant 
symptoms,  a  baseline  CPFQ  total  score  >25  was  used  as  a  cut-off  in  the  analyses.    The  CPFQ  data 
were  analysed  using  an  ANCOVA,  LOCF  supplemented  with  an  ANCOVA,  OC.    A  path  analysis  was 
performed  for  the  cognitive  assessment  tools  (DSST,  RAVLT,  and  CPFQ)  to  assess  the  direct  and 
indirect effects of Vortioxetine on cognitive dysfunction. 
To  evaluate  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  HRQoL  data,  in  line  with  the  EMA  Reflection  Paper,  the 
standardised  effect  size  was  calculated,  and  the  standard  0.2  threshold  was  used  to  interpret  the 
clinical relevance of the results.  
Relapse-prevention study 
The efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS, defined as all randomised patients who took at least 
one dose of IMP in the Double-blind Period. The primary analysis of time to relapse considered data up 
to Week 24 in the double-blind period. The treatment groups were compared using a Cox model with 
an  exact  method  to  handle  ties;  this  analysis  was  supplemented  by  Kaplan-Meier  plots.  Withdrawals 
that  occurred  before  Week  24  in  the  Double-blind  Period  due  to  reasons  other  than  lack  of  efficacy 
(relapse) were censored at dropout time, i.e. considered non-relapses.  
A secondary analysis of time to relapse considered all data in the double-blind period. 
As a sensitivity analyses, the Cox analysis was repeated excluding all relapses that occurred within 1,2, 
and  4  weeks  after  randomization,  in  order  to  separate  the  possible  effects  of  rebound  and 
discontinuation  symptoms  from  relapses  in  the  placebo  group.  Another  analysis  excluded  all  relapses 
that occurred >5 days after the date of last dose of double-blind study medication. Sensitivity analyses 
using a standard log-rank test and accelerated failure time models, taking the interval-censored nature 
of  the  data  into  account,  were  also  performed.  Various  distributions  were  studied  in  these  models 
including Weibull and log-normal. 
The  secondary  variables  were  evaluated  using  descriptive  statistics,  ANCOVA,  using  both  the  OC  and 
LOCF, and χ² tests for response and remission. 
Time to event analyses including log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier estimates were provided to compare 
treatment  arms  with  respect  to  all  reasons  leading  to  withdrawal,  adverse  events  leading  to 
withdrawal, and lack of efficacy leading to withdrawal.

Mixed  model  for  repeated  measurements  (MMRM)  with  centre,  week, 
baseline*week,  and  week*treatment  as  factors,  unstructured  covariance 
matrix. 
The comparisons of 10 mg were considered primary. 
The  efficacy  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  pre-defined  sequential  order  at 
significance level 0.05; as soon as an endpoint was non-significant at 0.05, 
the testing procedure stopped for all subsequent endpoints. 
The  Vortioxetine  10  mg  group  was  statistically  significantly  different  from 
placebo. Since the formal testing was stopped at the second variable in the 
pre-specified  order,  none  of  the  subsequent  endpoints  in  the  testing 
hierarchy  were  considered  statistically  significantly  different  from  placebo. 
This  includes  the  change  from  Baseline  in  HAM-D24  total  score  after  8 
weeks of treatment for the 5 mg.

To adjust for multiplicity, the 15 and 20mg doses of vortioxetine were tested 
separately  versus  placebo  in  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy 
analyses  at  a  Bonferroni-corrected  significance level  of  0.025.  A  predefined 
sequence  of  hierarchically  ordered  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints 
was fixed in the SAP. 
Both doses of Vortioxetine were statistically significantly superior to placebo 
in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8. In addition, 
both doses of vortioxetine were statistically significantly superior to placebo 
in all the key secondary efficacy analyses (MADRS response, CGI-I score, ∆ 
MADRS total score [baseline HAM-A≥20], MADRS remission, and ∆ SDS total 
score).

For the two Vortioxetine doses 15 mg and 20 mg the efficacy endpoints will 
be  tested  for  each  dose  in  a  sequential  order,  predefined  in  the  SAP,  at 
significance level 0.025. 
Vortioxetine  20  mg  was  statistically  significantly  better  than  placebo  in 
reducing the MADRS total score at Week 8.

To control the two-sided type I error over all the efficacy endpoints that are 
intended  to  support  potential  claims  among  the  two  Vortioxetine  doses  10 
mg  and  20  mg,  the  efficacy  endpoints  were  tested  for  each  dose  in  a 
predefined sequential order at significance level 0.025. 
Vortioxetine  20  mg  was  statistically  significantly  better  than  placebo  in 
mean  change  from  Baseline  in  MADRS  total  score  at  Week  8.  The  parallel 
sequence  testing  strategy  stopped  for  the  20-mg  dose  at  the  MADRS 
responders step which was not significantly different from placebo.  
Vortioxetine 10 mg was not significantly different from placebo at Week.

Change from baseline in MADRS total score at week 8 based on FAS. 
A non-inferiority comparison of vortioxetine versus agomelatine was made 
using  estimates  from  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measurements  (MMRM,

Notes 
Non-inferiority was established, as the upper bound of the 95% CI for the 
vortioxetine  and  agomelatine  comparison  was  -0.81  MADRS  points,  and 
therefore  clearly  below  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  +2  MADRS  points 
versus agomelatine. 
The  positive  results  were  confirmed  by  the  sensitivity  analyses  (PPS, 
MMRM; ANCOVA, FAS, LOCF).

A  statistical  testing  strategy,  based  on  a  pre-defined  hierarchy  of    ordered 
hypotheses was defined a priori in the SAP 
VOR_5 was statistically significantly superior to placebo on the mean change 
from baseline in HAM-D24 total score at Week 8 and at Week 6, but not at 
Week 4; the testing strategy was therefore stopped at Week 4

ANCOVA adjusting for centre and baseline MADRS, OC 
The mean values per visit during the Double-blind Period are quite different, 
depending on whether OC or the LOCF is used. This difference occurs since 
a  considerably  larger  proportion  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  withdrew 
from  the  study.  The  mean  treatment  differences  to  placebo  in  the  Double-
blind  Period  were  generally  larger  for  the  VOR  group  in  the  LOCF  analyses 
than  in  the  OC  analyses,  however,  primarily  OC  data  are  presented  in  the 
body  of  this  report  as  they  best  reflect  the  patients  who  responded  to 
treatment.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Meta-analyses  including  all  the  short-term  studies  (except  the  dedicated  study  in  the  elderly,  as  it 
only  included  patients  aged  ≥65  years)  were  performed  on  the  MADRS  (total  score,  total  score  with 
baseline MADRS greater than or equal to 30, total score with baseline HAM-A greater than or equal to 
20,  and  single  items),  CGI-I  score,  HAM-A  (total  score  and  item  5),  SF-36  MCS  and  Physical 
Component  Summary  scores,  SF-36  domain  scores,  and  SDS  total  scores.  Meta-analyses  were  also 
performed for the subset of studies conducted outside the United States.  
All  meta-analyses  on  the  MADRS  score  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  observed  with 
the 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg dose, but not with the 15 mg dose. The 15 mg dose was included in two 
studies,  one  performed  in  Europe  and  South  Africa  (13267A)  in  which  it  turned  out  positive  and  one 
performed  in  the  US  (315)  in  which  it  turned  out  negative.  The  meta-analysis  restricted  to  the  four 
non-US studies (11492A, 11984A, 305, 13267A) showed that all doses were better than placebo as to 
the  MADRS  score.  Stepwise  updated  meta-analyses  (MMRM)  of  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in 
MADRS total score at week 6/8 were conducted to illustrate the effect of the addition of each of short-
term,  placebo-controlled  Studies  317,  14122  A  and  CCT-002  that  were  completed  between  MAA 
submission and 31 August 2013. 
The  effect  in  the  individual  studies  was  supported  by  the  meta-analysis  (MMRM)  of  the  mean  change 
from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6/8 in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies in adults. 
In  the  meta-analysis,  the  overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  across  the  studies  was  statistically 
significant: -2.3 points (p = 0.007), -3.6 points (p <0.001), and -4.6 points (p <0.001) for the 5, 10, 
and  20mg/day  doses,  respectively;  the  15mg/day  dose  did  not  separate  from  placebo  in  the  meta-
analysis, but the mean difference to placebo was -2.6 points (Panel 9). 
In the meta-analysis of all the short-term, placebo-controlled non-US studies in adults, the effect sizes 
and the increased effect with increasing dose were more pronounced (-3.2, -4.2, -5.5, and -5.4 points 
at  Week  6/8  for  the  5,  10,  15,  and  20mg/day  doses,  respectively  [Panel  9])  as  expected  when 
excluding negative or weak studies in casu the US studies 303, 304, 315, 316 and 303 
In  the  meta-analysis  of  the  initially  submitted  short-term  studies,  the    oOverall  mean  difference  to 
placebo in the change from Baseline in MADRS total score (FAS, MMRM) was of -2.57 [-0.67;-4.48] for 
the  5  mg/day  dose,  -4.11  [-2.06;-6.17]  for  the  10  mg/day  dose,  -3.54  [+0.43;  -7.51]  for  the  15 
mg/day  dose,  and  –4.53  [-1.88;-7.19]  for  the  20  mg/day  doseThree  additional  short-term  studies 
completed  between  MAA  submission  and  31  August  2013  have  subsequentially  been  included  in  the 
meta-analysis, of which two do not separate statistically from placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint 
(Study 317 and CCT-002), and one is a cognition study with efficacy on the MADRS scale as secondary 
endpoint (Study 14122A). 
The  inclusion  of  these  additional  studies  in  the  meta-analysis  results  in  lower  effect  sizes.  The  effect 
size  in  adults  (Overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  in  the  change  from  Baseline  in  MADRS  total  score 
(FAS,  MMRM))  was  -2.27  [-0.63;-3.92]  for  the  5  mg/day  dose,  -3.57  [-2.17;-4.97]  for  the  10 
mg/day  dose,  -2.60  [+0.54;  -5.75]  for  the  15  mg/day  dose,  and  –4.57  [-2.57;-6.57]  for  the  20 
mg/day  dose).  The  values  presented  in  bold  are  decreased  compared  to  the  initial  meta-analysis. 
Hence, the effect size of vortioxetine was moderate.   
The inclusion of two additional studies (317, CCT-002) and one cognition study (14122A) reduced the 
overall effect size, which however remained clinically relevant.  
Based on the overall data, a dose-response pattern has reasonably been established. 
The lower efficacy showed in the US studies remains difficult to explain.  
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 101/159 
 
  
 
As a whole, the results suggested that the efficacy of vortioxetine compared to placebo is of moderate 
clinical relevance.  
The red line indicates the target of clinical relevance (2 point difference to placebo in the change from 
Baseline in MADRS total score used in antidepressant research).  
With a stepwise addition of the recently completed short-term, placebo-controlled studies, the results 
of the meta-analyses did not change the overall dose-response pattern. However, the effect size was 
lower due to the addition of two failed/negative studies. 
A similar tendency was observed in the meta-analyses on the MADRS 50% response rate at Week 
6/8, the MADRS≤10 remission rate at Week 6/8, and the HAM-A total score at Week 6/8. 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 102/159 
 
 
  
 
The  meta-analyses  on  the  MADRS  50%  response  at  Week  6/8  showed  that  vortioxetine  treatment 
separated from placebo in fourof the 8 studies in adults. In the meta-analysis, all doses except the 15 
mg dose gave a statistically significant odds ratio of 1.6 to 2. 
No meta-analysis was performed on the MADRS≤10 remission rate at Week 6/8 but data from the 
individual studies showed that a significant remission was obtained in 3 out of 8 studies in adults with 
the 5 mg and 10 mg dose in two studies (11492A, 305) and with the 15 mg and 20 mg dose in one 
study (13267A). Remission rates after vortioxetine treatment did not separate from placebo for the 5 
mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg in the failed study (11984A) and the US studies (315, 316, 303, 304).  
The 6-item version of the MADRS (MADRS6) contains a subset of MADRS items that are regarded as 
core symptoms of depression: apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, lassitude, inability to 
feel, and pessimistic thoughts. The meta-analysis on the MADRS single item score showed small effect 
sizes  ranging  between  0.22  and  0.66  point  difference  from  placebo  on  the  6  core  depression 
symptoms. The 15 mg dose did not separate from placebo except on the reported sadness itemon any 
of the 6 core items. Vortioxetine scored below 0.4 points and/or without statistical significance on inner 
tension, lassitude and inability to feel. A somewhat better score above 0.4 points and more statistical 
significance  across  the  different  doses  was  obtained  on  apparent  sadness,  reported  sadness,  and 
pessimistic thoughts.  
The meta-analyses of the MADRS single item scores at Week 6/8 in the short term, placebo-controlled 
studies in adults have been updated with Studies 317, 14122A, and CCT-002. 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 103/159 
 
 
 
  
 
The  results  of  the  updated  meta-analyses  did  not  change  the  overall  dose-response  pattern  of  the 
MADRS single items score 
The  effects  on  the  MADRS  single  items  compared  to  placebo  are  modest  and  the  overall  data  being 
lower  in  the  second  meta-analysis  including  all  short-term  studies  than  in  the  first  meta-analysis. 
However, the differences compared to placebo were demonstrated to be statistically significant.

The  meta-analyses  of  the  initially  submitted  9  short  term  studies  on  the  HAM-A  total  score,  which 
reflects the anxiety level in depressed patients, showed that the observed effect size obtained with 
the  15  mg  dose  was  -1.30  points  and  did  not  reach  clinical  significance  (p=0.296).  In  4  placebo-
controlled  short-term  studies  in  adults  in  which  efficacy  was  established,  vortioxetine  separated  from 
placebo (p <0.05) in the analysis (MMRM) of the mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score at 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013

Week  6/8.  The  effect  in  the  individual  studies  was  supported  by  the  meta-analysis  (MMRM)  of  the 
mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAM-A  total  score  at  Week  6/8  in  the  short-term  studies  in  adults.  In 
the  meta-analysis,  the  overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  across  the  studies  was  statistically 
significant: -1.5 points (p = 0.012), -2.1 points (p = 0.008), and -2.0 points (p = 0.046) for the 5, 10, 
and 20 mg/day doses, respectively. 
The  results  of  the  updated  meta-analysis  including  Studies  317  and  CCT-002  confirm  the  less 
favourable  outcome  observed  when  all  studies  are  included  in  the  meta-analysis.  The  overall  dose-
response  pattern  did  not  change.  However,  the  effect  of  vortioxetine  on  lowering  anxiety  levels  in 
depressed  patients  is  lower  than  previously  estimated  in  the  first  meta-analysis.  Inclusion  of  the 
additional  studies  results  in  overall  lower  HAM-A  effect  sizes  for  all  doses,  as  indicated  by  the  bold 
values: 
-1.21 points (p =0.019), -1.69 points (p =0.003), and -1.73 points (p =0.020) for the 5, 10, and 20 
mg/day  doses,  respectively;  the  15mg/day  dose  did  not  separate  from  placebo  in  the  meta-analysis 
with an effect size of -0.88 points (p=0.291). 
Of  note,  in  the  four  short-term  GAD  studies  including  doses of  2.5  to  10  mg  (studies  308,  309,  310, 
311) vortioxetine (5 mg) separated from placebo only in 1 of the 4 studies (European study 311) in the 
primary endpoint mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score after 8 weeks of treatment.  
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 106/159 
 
 
 
  
 
In meta-analyses of the initially submitted short term studies of the mean CGI-I score at Week 6/8, 
the  overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  across  the  studies  was  statistically  significant:  -0.3  points  (p 
=0.001),  -0.5  points  (p  <0.001),  and  -0.5  points  (p  =  0.047)  for  the  5,  10,  and  20mg/day  doses, 
respectively; the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis (the difference to 
placebo was -0.4 points). The CGI-I scores of the active comparator, venlafaxine or duloxetine, were in 
general numerically superior to those of vortioxetine. The meta-analysis restricted to the four non-US 
studies (11492A, 11984A, 305, 13267A) showed that all doses were clinically relevant as to the CGI-I 
score.  
The results of the updated meta-analyses including studies 317, 14122 A, and CCT-002 did not change 
the  overall  dose-response  pattern.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  size  was  improved 
(Panel 45). The results are summarised below. 
The  overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  across  the  studies  was  statistically  significant:  -0.3  points  (p 
<0.001),  -0.4  points  (p  <0.001),  and  -0.5  points  (p  =  0.002)  for  the  5,  10,  and  20mg/day  doses, 
respectively; the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis (the difference to 
placebo was -0.29 points). Therefore the overall effect on the CGI-score was modest.  When the meta-
analysis  (MMRM)  of  the  mean  CGI-I  score  at  Week  6/8  was  repeated  for  the  short-term,  placebo-
controlled  studies  in  adults  conducted  outside  the  United  States,  the  results  were  similar  but  more 
pronounced; the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: -0.4 
points (p <0.001), -0.5 points (p <0.001), -0.7 points (p <0.001), and -0.7 points (p = 0.002) for the 
5, 10, 15, and 20mg/day doses, respectively. 
The  meta-analyses  on  the  SDS  total  score,  which  provides  a  patient-rated  assessment  of  impaired 
functioning in the areas of work, social life, and family life, showed clinical improvement for the 10 and 
20 mg doses but not for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose. The 5 mg dose was also not clinically relevant in 
the meta-analysis restricted to the four non-US studies. (Panel 93).

In the meta-analysis including studies 317 and CCT-002, the overall mean difference to placebo across 
the studies was statistically significant: -1.7 points (p <0.001) for the 10mg/day dose and -1.9 points 
(p  =  0.006)  for  the  20mg/day  dose;  the  5  and  15mg/day  doses  were  not  statistically  significantly 
different from placebo. No consistent dose-effect could be shown. 
The applicant presented an extensive analysis regarding HRQoL and overall functioning. Although it is 
agreed that all HRQoL and overall functioning instruments used in the clinical development programme 
are  validated  assessment  tools  with  sufficient  reliability  their  homogeneous  use  through  all  dosages 
has not been shown. The only scale that was used in most (9) of the short term-studies was the SDS 
scale.  Results  separated  nominally  from  placebo  (p<0.05)  in  four  of  the  studies  (studies  11984A  for 
the 10 mg dose only, study 13267A for 15 and 20 mg, study 316 for 20 mg dose only, and study CCT-
002 for 10 mg only but not for 5 and 20 mg) but not for all dosages in all domains; furthermore, as 
SDS endpoint in these studies was lower in the hierarchy of the testing strategies than endpoints which 
did not separate from placebo, superiority over placebo was not statistically significant according to the 
strategy for multiple testing. Analyses of clinical relevance were conducted post-hoc and were not pre-
defined as requested in the “Reflection paper on the regulatory guidance for the use of health-related 
quality  of  life  (HRQL)  measures  in  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products”  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/  139391/ 
2004).  Neither  a  strategy  to  control  for  multiplicity  nor  the  effect  size  that  can  be  considered  as 
clinically relevant were pre-specified.  
The Applicant agreed that the drug effect of Vortioxetine on HRQoL is expected to be mediated through 
an  improvement  in  depressive  symptoms.  In  this  regard  HRQoL  assessments  provide  insight  in  the 
interpretation of the observed effect on the primary endpoint in terms of consequences for the patient.

It is acknowledged that a multidimensional approach (SDS, SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS), 
EQ-5D,  Q-LES-Q)  was  chosen  for  demonstration  of  an  effect  on  overall  functioning  observed  in  the 
Vortioxetine development programme.  
Effect on cognitive dysfunction 
Cognition  parameters  were  evaluated  in  two  studies,  study  316  and  in  the  dedicated  study  in  the 
elderly 12541A. In both studies different assessment tools were used: study 316 included the patient 
reported  outcome  CPFQ  as  additional  endpoint,  study  12541A  included  two  neuropsychological  tests 
DSST and RAVLT.  
In addition, a meta-analysis was conducted in the clinician-rated cognitive symptoms MADRS Item 6 – 
Concentration difficulties and HAM-A item 5 Difficulties in concentration and memory through 8 short-
term studies was performed. 
For  MADRS  Item  6  the  overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  across  the  studies  was  statistically 
significant: -0.2 points (p <0.001), -0.3 points (p = 0.007), -0.5 points (p <0.001), and -0.5 points (p 
<0.001)  for  the  5,  10,  15,  and  20mg/day  doses,  respectively.  Overall,  the  results  indicate  that, 
although there were variations across the studies, the effect of Vortioxetine increased with increasing 
dose.  In  the  dedicated  study  in  the  elderly  (study  12541A)  the  difference  of  Vortioxetine  5mg/  day  
versus placebo was -0.4 points (p<0.05). 
For HAM-A item 5 the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: 
-0.1 points (p = 0.006), -0.2 points (p = 0.001), -0.35 points (p = 0.002), and -0.4 points (p <0.001) 
for the 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/day doses, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that, although there 
were  variations  across  the  studies,  the  effect  of  Vortioxetine  increased  with  increasing  dose.  In  the 
dedicated study in the elderly (study 12541A) the difference of Vortioxetine 5mg/ day versus placebo 
was -0.25 points (p<0.05). 
This  meta-analysis  according  to  the  applicant  supports  the  favourable  effects  of  vortioxetine  on 
cognitive  dysfunction  and  is  seen  complementary  to  the  results  of  the  two  neuropsychological  tests 
RAVLT and DSST in study 12541A and the CPFQ Scores in study 316. 
However,  analyses  were  not pre-specified  and  may have  been  data-driven.  A convincing  independent 
effect  on  cognition  through  all  studies  has  not  been  shown  and  the  results  of  the  meta-analysis  are 
seen rather as an effect on the broad range of depressive symptoms than a specific effect on cognition 
since only some aspect of cognition are captured by these subscales. Pooled analyses (based on the 
MADRS  total  score)  were  only  performed  on  small  subpopulations  for  which  there  were  too  few 
patients in the individual studies for analysis.  
Since  submission  of  the  MAA,  additional  nonclinical  data  have  been  generated  that  strengthen  that 
Vortioxetine  has  the  potential  to  enhance  cognitive  function.    However,  convincing  clinical  data  to 
support this assumption are still lacking.  
Pooled efficacy analysis in the elderly 
A pooled efficacy analysis based on the short-term studies in adults was provided of elderly patients 
(aged  ≥65  years).  In  these  studies  about  13%  of  the  patients  were  aged  ≥65  years.  In  the  pooled 
analysis  of  patients  aged ≥65  years  from  the  short-term  studies  in  adults,  the  effect  sizes  at  Week  8 
were -4.0 (p 0.07), -5.5 (p 0.04), 0.01 (p 0.99), and -3.2 (p 0.23) points on the MADRS total score for 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 109/159 
 
 
  
 
5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/day, respectively. The data thus indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the dose 
range of 5 and 10 mg/day. Overall, in patients aged ≥65 years, the 15 mg dose had no effect whereas 
the  effect  of  the  20  mg  dose  was  not  statistically  different  from  placebo.  However,  the  number  of 
patients with the higher doses (15/20mg) is too small to draw clear conclusions. 
Supportive studies 
Persistence  of  efficacy  was  investigated  as  a  secondary  endpoint  in  three  completed  52-week,  open-
label  extension  studies  (Studies  11492C,  11984B,  and  301)  and  two  ongoing  52-week,  open-label 
extension studies (Studies 13267B and 314).  (see section 2.5.3 Discussion on supportive studies) 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on a development program of 9 short-term studies including a dedicated study 
in the elderly and 1 long-term placebo-controlled relapse-prevention study.  
The  nine  short-term  studies  were  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled,  fixed-
dose  studies  of  6  or  8  weeks’  duration.  In  six  of  the  studies  (including  the  dedicated  study  in  the 
elderly),  a  fixed  dose  of  an  active  reference  was  included  solely  for  internal  validation.  The  active 
reference  included  was  either  venlafaxine  225  mg/day  (Study  11492A)  or  duloxetine  60  mg/day 
(studies 11984A, 13267A, 315, 304 and 12541A). The choice of the active comparators is acceptable 
since venlafaxine and duloxetine are widely approved and used in the treatment of MDD. 
The  relapse-prevention  study  (study  11985A)  had  a  12-week  open-label,  flexible  dose  period 
(Vortioxetine  5mg  or  10mg)  followed  by  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  fixed-dose 
period of at least 24 weeks (Vortioxetine 5mg or 10mg).  
The  studies  were  designed  and  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  Declaration  of 
Helsinki
and in compliance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The study designs are generally 
in accordance with recommendations made in the EMA “Depression guideline” (CPMP/EWP/518/97, Rev 
1, April 2002). 
Three completed and two ongoing open-label, long-term extension studies provide supportive efficacy 
data. One of these two ongoing studies (study 13267B) was completed between MAA submission and 
31 August 2013. 
The  study  designs  varied  in  terms  of  primary  endpoints  (MADRS  or  HAM-D  scales),  secondary 
endpoints,  choice  of  active  comparator,  and  statistical  analysis  strategy.  The  nine  pivotal  studies 
included  a  total  of  about  5700  patients  of  whom  about  2700  were  treated  with  vortioxetine  in  the 
short-term studies. 
The  relapse  prevention  study  with  5  mg  and  10  mg  doses  of  vortioxetine  included  a  total  of  400 
patients in a 24-week double-blind period following a 12-week open label period with 639 patients. 
Three  open-label  extension  studies  included  a total of  1443  patients  and  provided  supportive efficacy 
data.  
The patients included in  the short-term studies had  mainly  moderate  to  severe  MDD  and  a  moderate 
level  of  anxiety  symptoms  as  indicated  by  baseline  scores  on  the  MADRS,  the  Clinical  Global 
Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and the HAM-A. Overall the patient population is considered 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 110/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
to  be  a  rather  homogen  sub-population  of  the  general  MDD  population  since  frequently  occurring 
comorbidities  and  suicidal  thoughts/suicidality,  amongst  others,  were  excluded.  This  is  considered 
acceptable  to  to  reduce  confounders  and  facilitation  of  evaluation  of  the  pure  antidepressant  effect. 
Approximately  one-half  to  two-thirds  of  the  patients  in  each  of  the  short-term  studies  in  adults  had 
severe  MDD  (baseline  MADRS  total  score  ≥30).  In  addition,  studies  11492A  and  303  only  recruited 
severely  depressed  patients  with  a  baseline  MADRS  total  score  of  34.  The  exclusion  and  withdrawal 
criteria were considered adequate. 
An  additional  4  short-term  clinical  studies  were  completed  between  MAA  submission  and  31  August 
2013.  All  studies  were  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group  studies.  Study  317  was  of  8  weeks 
duration and compared fixed-doses of Vortioxetine 10 and 15 mg versus placebo, study 14178A was of 
12 weeks duration and compared flexible doses of 10 and 20 mg of Vortioxetine versus flexible doses 
of  agomelatine  (25  or  50  mg/day)  in  MDD  patients,  study  CCT-002  was  an  8-week  study  in  about 
70 % Caucasian and 30% Asian (mainly Japanese) patients and compared fixed doses of Vortioxetine 
(5,10  or  20  mg/day)  versus  placebo.    These  three  studies  had  the  MADRS  as  primary  endpoint 
whereas  the  primary  objective  of  study  14122A  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  treatment  with 
Vortioxetine  10  or  20  mg/day  versus  placebo  on  cognitive  dysfunction.  No  active  comparator  was 
included in this latter study.  
Demographic  characteristics  across  the  studies  in  adults  were  similar,  with  approximately  twice  as 
many  women  as  men  and  a  mean  age  of  44  years  (mean  range:  42  to  47  years  across  studies). 
Differences  in  the  racial  distribution  across  the  studies  were  observed,  reflecting  the  fact  that  the 
studies were conducted in different geographical regions.  The majority (overall, 81%) of the patients 
were Caucasian; the remaining patients were mainly Asians (mean: 6%; range: 7% to 21% across the 
studies  that  included  Asians)  or  Blacks  (mean:  12%;  range:  21%  to  28%  across  the  studies  that 
included Blacks).  
The mean BMI differed somewhat between the studies conducted in the United States (approximately 
31kg/m2) and those conducted outside the United States (approximately 26kg/m2). In the dedicated 
study  in  the  elderly,  the  mean  age  of  the  patients  was  71  years  and  the  majority  (>90%)  of  the 
patients  were  Caucasians.  Otherwise,  the  baseline  patient  characteristics  of  this  population  were 
similar to that of the adult population. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint(s)  in  the  short-term  studies  (including  the  dedicated  study  in  the 
elderly)  were  either  the  MADRS  or  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  (HAM-D)  24.  Both  assessment 
tools are well established scales for assessing a change in depressive symptom severity and the use is 
in  accordance  with  the  guideline.  In  the  long-term  relapse-prevention  study,  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint was the time to relapse of MDD within the first 24 weeks of the Double-blind Period. 
The  inter-rater  reliability  scores  (kappa)  were  provided  showing  the  raters  were  trained  in  using  the 
efficacy rating scale used to assess the primary variable. The inter-rater variability was determined to 
be fair. 
The  efficacy  of  Vortioxetine  was  further  assessed  based  on  the  MADRS  single-item  scores,  the 
Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A)  total  score, the  proportions  of  responders  and  remitters,  and 
the  Clinical  Global  Impression  –  Global  Improvement  (CGI-I)  score,  which  reflects  the  investigator’s 
global clinical judgement of the outcome of treatment.  
A  ≥50%  decrease  from  baseline  in  MADRS  or  HAM-D24  total  score  was  defined  in  the  protocols  as  a 
response  criterion  and  a  MADRS  or  HAM-D24  total  score  ≤10  was  defined  as  a  remission  criterion 
which is in line with literature data. However, in the elderly study (12541A), response was defined as a 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 111/159 
 
 
 
  
 
≥50% decrease from baseline in HAM-D24, MADRS, or HAM-D17 total score or a CGI-I score ≤2 and 
remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤10, or a HAM-D17 total score ≤7, or a CGI-S score ≤2. 
In addition, the effect of Vortioxetine was assessed in patients with severe MDD (baseline MADRS total 
score ≥30) or a high level of anxiety (defined as a baseline HAM-A total score ≥20), as these patients 
are difficult to treat and the treatment outcome is typically poorer. 
Specific cognitive symptoms were evaluated in four studies. The neuropsychological tests Rey Auditory 
Verbal  learning  Test  [RAVLT]  (learning  and  memory)  and  the  Digit  Symbol  Substitution  Test  [DSST] 
(speed  of  processing,  executive  function,  and  attention)  were  secondary  endpoints  in  the  dedicated 
study  in  the  elderly.  The Cognitive  and  Physical  Functioning  Questionnaire  [CPFQ]  which  is  a  patient-
reported  outcome  parameter  designed  to  assess  clinically  relevant  cognitive  and  physical  symptoms 
associated with depression was an additional endpoint in studies 316 and 317. Cognitive impairment is 
recognised as an important characteristic during the acute phase of MDD. The applicant´s rationale to 
conduct  neuropsychological  tests  primarily    in  the  elderly  was  that  cognitive  dysfunction  in  MDD  is 
known  to  be  even  more  pronounced  in  the  elderly  than  in  adults  and  is  therefore  considered  more 
sensitive to change.  This is acknowledged, however for an assumed independent effect on cognition it 
would  have  been  expected  to  show  this  effect  in  the  overall  population  and  not  only  in  the  elderly 
population.  The Applicant provided study 14122A which was completed between MAA submission and 
31 August 2013. The study was conducted in adult patients (aged 18 to 65 years) with MDD and the 
primary  endpoint  was  a  composite  score  of  the  DSST  (executive  function,  speed  of  processing,  and 
attention) and the RAVLT (learning and memory). Although it is acknowledged that with this study an 
effort was undertaken to study cognitive dysfunction in patients with MDD the results of this study still 
are  not  sufficient  to  support  the  claim  of  an  independent  effect  on  cognition  as  outlined  above.  The 
main  caveat  is  the  lack  of  an  active  comparator  e.g.  duloxetine  to  provide  internal  validity  (assay 
sensitivity) of the study.  
The following patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment tools were included in 
the  evaluation  of  Vortioxetine:  The  Study  short  Form  36  version  2.0  [SF-36  v2]  was  used  as  a 
cornerstone  in  the  evaluation  of  the  effect  of  Vortioxetine  on  the  patients’  HRQoL  (5  studies), 
complemented with the Qualitiy of Life enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form [Q-LES-Q 
SF] (1 study), the EuroQoL [EQ-5D] (1 study) and the Twelve item Health Status Questionnaire [HSQ-
12] (in the elderly population study).  
The patients’ overall functioning was assessed by using the Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS] (9 studies), 
which  provides  an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  clinical  conditions  on  the  functional  domains  of  work, 
social and family life. Inclusion of HRQoL assessment tools is in line with the “Reflection paper on the 
regulatory guidance  for  the  use of  health-related  quality of  life  (HRQL)  measures  in the  evaluation of 
medicinal  products”(  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/139391/2004).  However,  analyses  of  clinical  relevance  were 
conducted post hoc and were not pre-defined as requested in the Reflection paper. The justification of 
clinical relevance for the SDS and SF-36 MCS based on the application of general ‘standard’ thresholds 
such as Cohen’s rule that an SMD of 0.2 is a small effect size, 0.5 medium and 0.8 is not appropriate, 
as the relevance of a standardized effect size cannot be evaluated based on a general rule but has to 
be interpreted in dependence on the context. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  first  study  (11492A)  compared  the  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  5  mg  and  10  mg  vs.  placebo  with 
venlafaxine  225  mg  as  active  comparator  to  check  assay  sensitivity.  The  primary  efficacy  analyses 
showed  that  both  doses  of  vortioxetine  were  statistically  superior  to  placebo  in  mean  change  from 
baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 5.9 (5 mg) 
and 5.7 points (10 mg). Venlafaxine was also statistically significantly superior to placebo at Week 6, 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 112/159 
 
 
 
  
 
with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 6.4 points. Response and remission rates were about 
22-percentage  points%  higher  in  the  vortioxetine  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  The  rates 
were  28  percentage  points  higher  in  the  venlafaxine  group  compared  to  placebo.  Patients  on  10  mg 
vortioxetine treatment improved somewhat better on the patient-rated quality of life scale, SF-36, than 
those  on  the  5  mg  dose.  The  improvement  of  the  patients’  HRQoL  was  more  pronounced  in  the 
venlafaxine group.  
The second study (11984A) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg vs. 
placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator. In the primary efficacy analysis, there was no 
statistically significant difference between vortioxetine 5 or 10 mg/day and placebo in the change from 
baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8. Hence, the pre-defined, sequential testing procedure was 
stopped at the first step. Also, there was no statistically significant difference between duloxetine 
60mg/day and placebo in the primary efficacy analysis. Hence, this study is considered failed. In 
addition, vortioxetine 2.5 mg/day did not separate from placebo. The lack of efficacy of vortioxetine 
and duloxetine was believed mainly to be due to the early timing of withdrawals, resulting in missing 
data which affected the LOCF analysis. An MMRM analysis which is more robust towards missing data 
showed a separation from placebo in favour of vortioxetine 5 mg and 10 mg (p <0.05) and duloxetine 
(p <0.01) at Week 8, but not for vortioxetine 2.5 mg. The mean treatment differences to placebo were 
of about 2.5 points for vortioxetine (2.5 and 2.6 points for 5 and 10mg /day respectively) and 3 points 
for duloxetine. 
The third study (305) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 1 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg vs. placebo. Since 
the  1  mg  dose  was  expected  to  be  not  efficacious,  it  was  not  included  in  the  pre-specified  statistical 
testing  procedure.  The  vortioxetine  10  mg  group  was  statistically  different  for  the  primary  endpoint, 
i.e.  change  from  Baseline  in  HAM-D24  total  score  at  Week  8.  However,  the  10  mg  dose  was  not 
statistically  significantly  different  from  placebo  in  the  second  variable  in  the  testing  hierarchy,  i.e. 
change  from  Baseline  in  the  SDS  total  score  at  Week  8,  which  is  a  patient-rated  quality  of  life  scale. 
Since the formal statistical testing was stopped at the second variable in the pre-specified order, none 
of  the  subsequent  endpoints  in  the  pre-specified  testing  hierarchy  were  considered  statistically 
different from placebo. This includes the change from Baseline in HAM-D24 total score after 8 weeks of 
treatment for the 1 mg and the 5 mg dose even though nominal P<0.001 (MMRM). However, with the 
effect  size  shown  and  the  nominal  P-value  <0.05  in  the  comparison  of  vortioxetine  5  mg  versus 
placebo,  it  indicated  clinical  relevance  of  the  5  mg  dose.  Thus,  only  the  outcome  of  the  10  mg  dose 
versus  placebo  was  statistically  significant  for  the  LS  mean  change  from  Baseline  in  HAM-D24  total 
score  at  Week  8  (primary  endpoint,  the  first  parameter  in  the  pre-specified  testing  order  that  was 
statistically  significant).  However,  the  outcome  of  the  1  mg,  5  mg  and  10  mg  doses  were  clinically 
significant for the primary endpoint and several secondary endpoints including change from Baseline in 
MADRS  total  score  at  Week  8  (P<0.001),  HAM-D24  response  rate  at  Week  8 (P<0.001),  and  MADRS 
remission rate.  
However, the vortioxetine treatments could not be distinguished from placebo, in the area of quality of 
life improvement, as self-rated by the patients.  
The fourth study (13267A) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 15 mg and 20 mg vs. placebo with 
duloxetine  60  mg  as  active  comparator.  Effect  sizes  were  generally  high  in  this  study.The  primary 
efficacy analyses showed that both doses of vortioxetine were statistically superior to placebo in mean 
change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 
5.5 (15 mg) and 7.1 points (20 mg). Duloxetine was also statistically significantly superior to placebo 
at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 9.5 points. The odds ratios for response and 
remission were about 3 and 2.5, resp., in the vortioxetine group compared to the placebo group. The 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 113/159 
 
  
 
active comparator showed odds ratios of 6 and 5, for response and remission, resp. Patients on 20 mg 
vortioxetine treatment improved somewhat better on the primary and secondary endpoints, including 
the  patient-rated  quality  of  life  scale,  SF-36,  than  those  on  the  15  mg  dose.  The  improvement  was 
again  more  pronounced  in  the  duloxetine  group.  Thus,  although  a  direct  comparison  between 
vortioxetine  and  duloxetine  was  not  the  objective  of  this  study,  the  data  show  a  greater  numerical 
effect size with duloxetine than with vortioxetine 
The fifth study (315) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 15 mg 
and  20  mg  vs.  placebo  with  duloxetine  60  mg  as  active  comparator.  The  primary  efficacy  analyses 
showed that only the 20 mg dose of vortioxetine was statistically superior to placebo in mean change 
from  baseline  in  MADRS  total  score  at  Week  8,  with  a  mean  treatment  difference  to  placebo  of  2.75 
(P=0.023). The 15 mg dose showed a minor improvement of 1.5 points over placebo in MADRS total 
scores, which was neither statistically nor clinically significant. Duloxetine was statistically significantly 
superior to placebo at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 4 points, which was less 
than  half  the  value  obtained  in  the  previous  study  (13267A).  The  odds  ratios  for  response  and 
remission  were  about  1.3  and  1,  resp.,  in  the  vortioxetine  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group. 
Duloxetine  performed  better  with  an  odds  ratio  of  2  for  response  rate.  The  odds  ratio  for  remission 
rates  of  duloxetine,  however,  was  about  1  and  hence  not  superior  over  vortioxetine  or  over  placebo. 
None  of  the  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  separated  from  placebo  (nominal  p<0.050)  with  either 
vortioxetine  dose.  The  odds  ratios  for  response  indicate  that  response  was  twice  as  likely  in  the 
placebo  group  than  in  the  vortioxetine  treatment  groups.  The  proportions  of  subjects  in  remission  as 
defined by MADRS total score or CGI-S were generally similar across treatment groups. In the patient-
rated  SDS  total  score,  the  15  mg  dose  was  about  equal  to  placebo  with  a  mean  difference  of  0.05 
points (P = 1). The 20 mg dose showed a 0.9 point improvement compared with placebo (P = 0.4).  
The sixth study (316) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 mg 
and 20 mg vs. placebo. The primary efficacy analyses showed that only the 20 mg dose of vortioxetine 
was  statistically  superior  to  placebo  with  a  treatment  difference  of  3.64  points  in  mean  change  from 
baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8  (P=0.002). The 10 mg dose showed slight improvements in 
primary  (2.19  points  in  mean  change  from  baseline  in  MADRS  total  score)  and  secondary  endpoints, 
including  response  and  remission  rate  and the  patient-rated  SDS total  score, but  these did  not  reach 
statistical  significance  (P>0.05).  The  20  mg  dose  also  showed  slight  improvements  in  the  secondary 
endpoints  response  and  remission  rate  and  SDS  total  score,  with  varying  statistical  significance 
(0.025<P<0.059).  
The seventh study (303) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 5 mg 
vs. placebo. The primary efficacy analyses showed that the 5 mg dose of vortioxetine was statistically 
not  superior  to  placebo  in  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAM-D24  total  score  at  Week  6.  Values  for 
the  secondary  efficacy  variables  from  the  sequential  testing  as  well  as  the  other  secondary  efficacy 
variables for 5 mg vortioxetine were similar to placebo.  
The  eighth  study  (304)  was  performed  in  the  US  only  and  compared  the  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  2.5 
mg and 5 mg vs. placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator. The primary efficacy analyses 
showed  that  the  2.5  mg  and  5  mg  dose  of  vortioxetine  did  not  separate  from  placebo  in  any  of  the 
primary  or  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  and  did  not  provide  evidence  of  a  clinical  benefit.  However, 
duloxetine separated from placebo on the primary and all key secondary endpoints (P <0.05).

Study 14178A was conducted in Europe and included men or women, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years, who 
had  depressive  symptoms  considered  as  non  or  partially  responsive  to  no  more  than  one  adequate 
course (licensed doses for ≥6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit) of SSRI/SNRI monotherapy (SSRIs: 
citalopram,  escitalopram,  paroxetine,  sertraline,  and  SNRIs:  duloxetine,  venlafaxine)  for  a  single 
episode  of  MDD  (diagnostic  code  296.2x)  or  recurrent  MDD  (diagnostic  code  296.3x),  according  to 
DSM-IV-TR™ criteria, and who were candidates for a switch in the investigator’s opinion and wished to 
change  antidepressant  treatment  to  either  vortioxetine  or  agomelatine.  Treatment  resistant  patients 
(defined  as  inadequate  response  to  two  prior  courses  of  at  least  6  weeks  of  conventional 
antidepressant  drugs  in  adequate  dosages)  were  excluded  from  this  trial.  The  rationale  for  choosing 
agomelatine as the active comparator was that it has a mechanism of action that is different from that 
of SSRIs/SNRIs, in that it is a norepinephrine dopamine inhibitor (NDDI), whereas Vortioxetine might 
represents a new pharmacological class of antidepressants, which might have a different mechanism of 
action, in that it could be a multimodal antidepressant. A total of 501 patients were randomized equally 
(1:1) to flexible doses of either Vortioxetine (VOR) 10 or 20mg/day or agomelatine 25 or 50mg/day for 
12  weeks  of  double-blind treatment.  The  applied  statistical  methods  were  the  same  as  utilized in  the 
previous studies, which is considered appropriate (primary endpoint difference from baseline in MADRS 
total score at Week 8 was evaluated using a MMRM approach). 
The  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  definition  of  the  patient  population  “patients  with  MDD  who  have 
responded inadequately to SRI antidepressant monotherapy”, for the following reasons:  
Inadequate  response  to  previous  SRI  monotherapy  is  assumed    based  on  the  mean  MADTRS  total 
score  at  baseline/randomisation  whereas  documented  evidence  of  the  severity  of  depression  at  the 
onset of the first SRI monotherapy are not available and data on response and patient compliance to 
this  SRI  monotherapy  were  collected  retrospectively.It  cannot  be  excluded  that  fully  responsive 
patients  to  the  first  SRI  monotherapy  could  have  been  included  in  the  study  since  the  severity  of 
depression was not assessed at the onset of the first monotherapyduring the lead-in period. However, 
the  patients  still  had  a  mean  MADRS  total  score  at  study  entry  of  29  points  (ranging  from  22  to  43 
points)  indicating  moderate  to  severe  depression.  In  the  absence  of  data  for  the  lead-in  period,  it 
cannot  be  established  whether  the  study  population  was  indeed  limited  to  non  responders  or  also 
included partial responders. 
Lack of patient compliance to the first SRI monotherapy could have lead to inadequate response to the 
SRI  monotherapy.  However,  patients  were  not  followed  during  the  SRI  monotherapy  and  their 
compliance  was  therefore  not  assessed  prospectivelybut  only  retrospectively  by  patient  reporting  via 
clinical interview. Patients’ decision to change treatment and participate in the clinical trial could have 
been motivated by reasons other than dissatisfaction with the first SRI monotherapy. 
Considering  the  half-lives of  the  SSRIs/SNRIs  allowed  in  the  lead-in  period  (fluoxetine  was  excluded) 
the  risk  of  a  carry-over  effect  of  the  first  SRI  monotherapy  is  considered  to  be  minimal  at  the 
assessement of the efficacy endpoint at week 8. 
The MMRM estimates for the mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8 were -16.5 
and  -14.4  points  in  the  vortioxetine  group  and  the  agomelatine  group,  respectively,  giving  a  mean 
difference of -2.16 points in favour of vortioxetine (95% CI: -3.5 to -0.81;p = 0.002). Non-inferiority 
was  established,  as the  upper bound  of the  95%  CI  for  the  vortioxetine  and agomelatine  comparison 
was  -0.81  MADRS  points,  and  therefore  clearly  below  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  +2  MADRS  points 
versus agomelatine. As the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between the means excluded zero and 
was  in  favour  of  vortioxetine,  vortioxetine  was  even  superior  to  agomelatine  (which  also  shows  that 
Brintellix

Page 115/159 
 
  
 
the trial had assay sensitivity).  The positive results were confirmed by the sensitivity analyses (PPS, 
MMRM;  ANCOVA,  FAS,  LOCF)  and  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints.  Vortioxetine  was  consistently 
statistically significantly better than agomelatine based on analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints 
(MADRS total score, HAM-A total score, CGI-S score, CGI-I score) and health-related quality of life and 
overall  functioning  scores  [SDS  total  score,  EQ-5D  Summary  Index,  WLQ  Global  Productivity  Index, 
and DFFS total score]) at Weeks 8 and 12 (FAS, MMRM), except for WLQ at Week 12. The proportion 
of MADRS and CGI-I responders was statistically significantly higher in the vortioxetine group than in 
the  agomelatine  group  at  Weeks  8  and  12.  At  Week  12,  nearly  three-quarters  of  the  patients  in  the 
vortioxetine  group  were  responders  (FAS,  LOCF,  logistic  regression).  The  proportion  of  MADRS  and 
CGI-S remitters was statistically significantly higher in the vortioxetine group than in the agomelatine 
group at Weeks 8 and 12. At Week 12, more than half of the patients in the vortioxetine group were 
remitters (FAS, LOCF, logistic regression). 
As a conclusion, the results of this head-to-head comparison study can be considered as supportive for 
the  claim  of  efficacy  in  this  group  of  patients,  but  cannot  be  used  to  claim  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  in 
treatment-resistant  patients,  neither  in  patients  with  MDD  who  have  responded  inadequately  to  SRI 
antidepressant monotherapy since the included patient population according to the study objective was 
only retrospectively defined.  
Study  14122A  was  conducted  in  Australia,  Canada,  Europe,  Mexico,  South  Africa,  and  the  United 
States. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were essentially the same as those in the other short-term 
MDD  studies.  A  total  of  602  patients  were  randomised  equally  (1:1:1)  to  placebo,  Vortioxetine 
10mg/day, or Vortioxetine 20mg/day for 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Approximately 86% of the 
patients in each treatment group completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite 
cognitive  score  (z-score) based  on the  DSST  (executive  function,  speed of  processing,  and  attention) 
and  the  RAVLT  (learning  and  memory).  Key  secondary  endpoints  were  the  respective  single  scores. 
Vortioxetine  10  and  20mg/day  were  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  the  composite  z-
score (p <0.001), as well as in the next pre-specified key secondary efficacy analysis of the DSST (p 
<0.001)  but  not  in  the  RAVLT  (learning)  score.  The  mean  difference  in  z-score  versus  placebo  was 
0.36 and 0.33 for vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg respectively. However, the clinical relevant effect size of 
this composite score is not known and was therefore not pre-defined. The cognitive performance of the 
patients in the four key domains was assessed using additional neuropsychological tests, namely, TMT 
A  (speed  of  processing)  and  B  (executive  function),  SRT  (speed  of  processing),  CRT  (attention),  and 
STROOP  (executive  function).  The  results  of  the  secondary  analyses  based  on  these  tests  supported 
the  results  of  the  primary  analysis,  that  is,  the  patients  who  received  vortioxetine  10  or  20mg/day 
improved  statistically  significantly  more  than  those  who  received  placebo  on  all  the  assessed 
measures,  with  the  exception  of  CRT  in  the  vortioxetine  20mg  group.  Vortioxetine  10  and  20mg/day 
demonstrated a consistent positive effect on depressive symptoms, as assessed using the MADRS: the 
difference to placebo in total score (FAS, MMRM) at Week 8 was -4.7 points for vortioxetine 10mg/day 
and  -6.7  points  for  vortioxetine  20mg/day.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  treatment  effect  was 
supported  by  the  effect  seen  on  the  clinical  global  impression  (CGI-S  and  CGI-I).  Furthermore, 
statistically significant proportions of patients responded (defined as a ≥50% reduction from baseline 
in MADRS total score) or remitted (defined as a MADRS total score ≤10): 48 and 59% of the patients 
in the vortioxetine 10 and 20mg groups, respectively, were responders and 30 and 38% of the patients 
in  the  vortioxetine  10  and  20mg  groups,  respectively,  were  remitters  at  Week  8.  The  difference  to 
placebo  in  the  proportion  of  responders  was  >16  percentage  points.  No  active  comparator  was 
included in this study, which would have been important to show that the cognitive improvement could 
not only be explained by the antidepressive effect. To evaluate whether the direct treatment effect on 
cognitive function was independent on depressive symptoms, the primary and key secondary analyses 
were  repeated  as  post-hoc  analyses  in  patients  who  had  not  responded  (non-responders,  that  is, 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 116/159 
 
  
 
patients  who  had  a  <50%  reduction  from  baseline  to  Week  8  in  MADRS  total  score)  and  in  patients 
who had not remitted (non-remitters, that is, patients who had a MADRS total score >10 at Week 8).    
Vortioxetine  10  and  20mg/day  were  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  the  composite  z-
score  (p  <0.001).  However,  if  a  composite  endpoint  is  used,  an  interpretation  of  the  resulting  scale 
should  be  provided  in  terms  of  the  size  of  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  (please  refer  to  ICH  E9, 
Statistical  Principles  for  Clinical  Trials,  CPMP/ICH/363/96)  but  the  applicant  did  not  provide  such  an 
interpretation.  As  clinical  interpretation  of  the  primary  endpoint  is  not  possible,  the  evaluation  of 
clinical relevance has to be based on the single components of the primary endpoint, which were key 
secondary  endpoints.  The  Applicant  argues  that  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  cognitive  effects  was 
supported  by  the  magnitude  of  the  standardized  effect  sizes,  the  pre-specified  path  analysis  and  the 
statistical significant effect on cognitive performance in patients who were defined as non-responders 
or non-remitters. However, it appears questionable that clinical relevance of the effects can be robustly 
concluded based on these analyses: the clinical relevance of an effect size depends on the context and 
cannot be evaluated based on general criteria such as Cohen’s d; the analysis in non-responders was a 
post-hoc analysis; the validity of the path analysis is not clear.  
It  is  not  clear  that  a  path  analysis  is  a  valid  model  to  quantify  the  proportion  of  the  direct  effect  of 
Vortioxetine on cognition which is not explained by the anti-depressant effect (the proportion of direct 
effect  depends  on  unverified  assumptions  on  the  functional  form  of  the  relationship  between 
improvement  on  depression  and  cognitive  symptoms  in  this  model.  Furthermore,  without  internal 
validation (i.e. without an active comparator), it is not clear whether path analysis supports a different 
profile compared to other antidepressants. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The  ninth  study  in  the  initial  submission  package  (12541A)  compared  the  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  5 
mg vs. placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator in 453 patients aged ≥65 years. A total of 
156 patients received vortioxetine 5 mg.  
Subgroup  analyses  in  the  previous  studies  showed  a  decreased  vortioxetine  efficacy  in  patients  aged 
≥55  years,  which  is  in  line  with  the  general  observation  of  reduced  antidepressant  efficacy  in  older 
patients. Hence, the choice of a lower than recommended 10 mg dose is surprising, but was justified 
by the Applicant for safety reasons. In view of the lower efficacy observed in patients above the age of 
55, the positive treatment effect of the 5 mg dose in elderly could not necessarily be expected.  
Overall,  the  mean  age  (±  SD)  at  baseline  was  71  ±  5  years,  the  ratio  of  men  to  women  was 
approximately  1:2,  and  the  vast  majority  (93%  to  96%)  of  the  patients  were  Caucasian.  The  study 
was conducted both inside and outside the United States. In the primary efficacy analysis, vortioxetine 
5 mg/day was statistically significantly (p = 0.001) better than placebo in reducing the HAM-D24 total 
score  at  Week  8,  with  a  mean  difference  to  placebo  of  -3.3  points.  Vortioxetine  5mg/day  was  also 
statistically significantly (p =0.024) better than placebo in reducing the HAM-D24 total score at Week 
6,  with  a  mean  difference  to  placebo  of  -2.1  points.  At  the  non-US  sites,  vortioxetine  5mg/day 
separated from placebo (p <0.001) in the MMRM analysis of the change from baseline in MADRS total 
score  at  Week  8.  The  mean  effect  size  was  5.3  points.  Similar  results  were  obtained  using  ANCOVA, 
LOCF.  At  the  US  sites  (approximately  one-third  of  the  study  population),  vortioxetine  5mg/day 
separated from placebo (p <0.05) in the MMRM analysis, but not in the ANCOVA, LOCF analysis. The 
lack  of  significance  probably  reflects  the  lack  of  power  for  the  subgroup  analysis.  The  vortioxetine-
placebo difference was approximately 2 points higher at the non-US sites than at the US sites, both in 
the MMRM and ANCOVA, LOCF analyses.

Study 12541 A had two special aspects that are highlighted subsequently. It was the only study among 
the 9 short-term studies that was a) conducted both in and outside the United States and b) it was the 
only study that included neuropsychological tests as cognition endpoints. 
Taking into account the results of the 4 other US studies, two of which were negative (studies 303 and 
304) and two of which showed efficacy only in the highest dose group of 20 mg (studies 315 and 316) 
it was of special interest to repeat primary and secondary efficacy analyses in this study separately for 
sites in and outside the US. The antidepressant-placebo differences in the mean changes from baseline 
in the MADRS and HAM-D24 (primary variable) total scores were approximately 2 points higher for the 
non-US  than  the  US  sites,  both  for  Vortioxetine  and  duloxetine  in  the  MMRM  and  ANCOVA,  LOCF 
analyses. 
For  the  non-US  sites,  Vortioxetine  5mg/day  separated  from  placebo  on  all  the  efficacy  variables  
(MADRS  total  score,  HAM-D24  total  score,  HAM-A  total  score,  CGI-S  score,  CGI-I  score),  both  in  the 
MMRM  and  in  the  ANCOVA,  LOCF  analyses.  For  the  US  sites,  Vortioxetine  5mg/day  separated  from 
placebo in the MMRM analyses of the mean changes from baseline in the MADRS total score and CGI-S 
score  and  of  the  mean  CGI-I  score.  In  contrast  no  separation  was  reached  for  any  parameter  in  the 
ANCOVA/LOCF analysis. 
This  difference  between  US/non-US  studies  was  further  substantiated  by  pharmacokinetic  data  from 
the phase II/III population showing lower and more variable LuAA21004  plasma concentrations in US 
patients  (see  PK  section)  and  it  may  be  concluded  that  US  patients  were  less  compliant  to  study 
medication.  
Cognitive dysfunction is recognised as an important characteristic during the acute phase of MDD. The 
neuropsychological  tests  RAVLT  (learning  and  memory)  and  DSST  (speed  of  processing,  executive 
function, and attention) were used in the dedicated study in the elderly, as these tests involve several 
of  the  cognitive  processes  that  are  known  to  be  impaired  in  patients  with  MDD.  The  applicant´s 
rationale to conduct these evaluations primarily in the elderly was that cognitive dysfunction in MDD is 
known  to  be  even  more  pronounced  in  the  elderly  than  in  adults  and  is  therefore  considered  more 
sensitive to change.  This is acknowledged, however for an assumed independent effect on cognition it 
would  have  been  expected  to  show  this  effect  in  the  overall  population  and  not  only  in  the  elderly 
population.  Vortioxetine  5mg/day  and  the  active  reference  duloxetine  separated  from  placebo  (p 
<0.05)  in  the  RAVLT  while  only  Vortioxetine  separated  from  placebo  (p  <0.05)  in  the  DSST.    This 
according  to  the  applicant  demonstrates  the  different  profile  versus  duloxetine  improving  not  only 
learning and memory capacities but also speed, attention and executive functioning and is claimed to 
be supported by the magnitude of the standardized effect sizes and nonclinical findings.  
In addition, a path analysis was performed to assess to what extent the effect on DSST and RAVLT was 
a direct treatment effect, rather than an indirect effect through improvement of depressive symptoms, 
as  measured  using  the  primary  assessment  tool  (HAM-D24).  The  results  showed  that  Vortioxetine 
5mg/day had an 83% direct effect on DSST correct numbers (duloxetine 26%), a 71% direct effect on 
RAVLT  acquisition  (duloxetine  65%),  and  a  72%  direct  effect  on  RAVLT  delayed  recall  (duloxetine 
66%). 
Concerning  the  path  analysis,  the  additional  information  and  the  sensitivity  analyses  that  were 
provided are somewhat reassuring on the robustness of the results of this analysis. Nevertheless, the 
path analysis is considered a post-hoc exploratory analysis without independent replication. Compared 
with duloxetine, a markedly higher direct effect of Vortioxetine was observed only for one of the three 
parameters of the neuropsychological tests DSST and RAVLT, which does not consistently support the 
claim of a different profile of Vortioxetine. Furthermore, the validity of the path analysis is somewhat 
challenged  by  the  path  analysis  for  DSST  using  total  MADRS  as  a  mediator  where  a  negative  direct 
effect on cognitive symptoms was found for duloxetine, which appears contradictory.

The  Applicant  furthermore  acknowledges  that  the  effect  on  the  clinician-rated  cognitive  symptoms 
(single  terms  of  the  MADRS  and  HAM-A)  is  part  of  the  effect  on  the  broad  range  of  depressive 
symptoms. 
Overall, a convincing independent effect on cognition remains to be  shown. 
Relapse prevention study 
In  the  relapse-prevention  study  11985A  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  showed  a  statistically 
significantly superior effect of vortioxetine relative to placebo on the time to relapse of MDD during the 
first  24  weeks  of  the  Double-blind  Period  (FAS;  Cox  proportional  hazard  model,  p  =  0.0035).  The 
proportion  of  patients  who  relapsed  was  lower  in  the  vortioxetine  group  (13%)  than  in  the  placebo 
group (26%). The Cox proportional hazard model gave a hazard ratio of 2.01, indicating that the risk 
of  relapse  was  two  times  higher  for  placebo-treated  patients  than  for  vortioxetine  -treated  patients. 
Vortioxetine was also statistically significantly superior to placebo in the secondary analysis of time to 
relapse  during  the  entire  Double-blind  Period  using  the  FAS.  The  robustness  of  the  results  was 
confirmed by a number of sensitivity analyses. 
Vortioxetine 5 mg or 10 mg flexible doses were effective in preventing relapse, as demonstrated both 
by  the  primary  and  by  the  secondary  statistical  analyses.  The  primary  analysis  of  the  time  from 
randomisation  to  relapse  within  the  first  24  weeks  of  the  Double-blind  Period  showed  statistically 
significant  superiority  over  placebo  with  respect  to  time  to  relapse  and  relapse  rates.  The  risk  of 
relapse was twice as high in the placebo group as in the vortioxetine group.  
The mean MADRS total scores were stable over time and remained close to the Baseline II level in both 
vortioxetine  and  placebo  groups  during  the  Double-blind  Period.  The  therapeutic  effect  in  MDD  was 
thus  maintained  and  stable  over  time  during  long-term  double-blind  period  (up  to  64  weeks)  in  both 
the placebo and the vortioxetine group.  
Questions  were  raised  regarding  the  analysis  of  the  time  to  relapse  in  the  double-blind  period  of  the 
relapse  prevention  study  (11985A).  In  the  placebo  group,  mainly  withdrawals  due  to  lack  of  efficacy 
are  expected  whereas  in  the  vortioxetine  group  mainly  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  events  are 
expected.  The  study  considered  adverse  events  always  as  primary  reason  for  withdrawal.  The 
Applicant clarified that all withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were considered in the analysis, that is, 
not only those where lack of efficacy was given as the primary reason for withdrawal. Furthermore, if a 
patient  was  not  withdrawn  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  but  had  a  MADRS  total  score  ≥22,  the  patient  was 
considered relapsed. 
Supportive studies 
Persistence  of  efficacy  was  investigated  as  a  secondary  endpoint  in  three  completed  52-week,  open-
label  extension  studies  (Studies  11492C,  11984B,  and  301)  and  two  ongoing  52-week,  open-label 
extension studies (Studies 13267B and 314). A total of 1443 patients received vortioxetine 2.5 mg, 5 
mg,  or  10  mg/day.  An  additional  2557  patients  received  vortioxetine  in  the  open-label  extension 
studies  (1443  patients  in  the  completed  studies  and  1114  patients  in  the  ongoing  studies  as  of  29 
February 2012). No placebo control was included in the 52-week, open-label extension studies.  
The first extension study (11492C) evaluated the maintenance of the therapeutic effect of 5 mg or 10 
mg flexible doses of vortioxetine over a period of 52 weeks in 74 patients with MDD who completed the 
6-week short-term Study 11492A. After completing the 6-Week venlafaxine-controlled Study 11492A, 
eligible  patients  were  switched  to  a  10  mg/day  vortioxetine  dose.  After  the  first  week,  the  dose  was 
flexible (5 or 10mg/day) based on the patient’s tolerability to treatment, as judged by the investigator. 
The  mean  MADRS  total  score  decreased  from  10.7  points  at  Baseline  II  to  5.3  points  at  Week  52,  a

reduction  of  approximately  5.4  points,  indicating  maintained  improvement  in  depressive  symptoms 
during the extension study. 
However,  the  data  are  inconclusive  due  to the  lack  of  a  placebo  control  and  low  numbers  of  patients 
included in each group.  
The second extension study (11984B) evaluated the maintenance of the therapeutic effect of 2.5 mg, 5 
mg  or  10  mg  flexible  doses  of  vortioxetine  over  a period  of  52  weeks  in 535  patients  with  MDD  who 
completed the 8-week short-term Study 11984A. After completing the 8-Week Study 11492A, eligible 
patients  were  switched  to  a  5  mg/day  vortioxetine  dose.  After  the  first  week,  the  dose  was  flexible 
(2.5, 5 or 10mg/day) based on the patient’s tolerability to treatment, as judged by the investigator. 
The mean MADRS total score decreased from 13.5 points at Baseline II to 5.5 points at Week 52, and 
the  mean  CGI-S  score  decreased  from  2.7  points  at  Baseline  II  to  1.7  points  at  Week  52,  indicating 
maintained  improvement  in  depressive  symptoms  and  the  global  impression  during  the  extension 
study.  
The third extension study (301) evaluated the maintenance of the therapeutic effect of 2.5 mg, 5 mg 
or  10  mg  flexible  doses  of  vortioxetine  over  a  period  of  52  weeks  in  834  patients  with  MDD  who 
completed  the  8-week  short-term  Study  304  or  Study  305.  After  completing  the  8-Week  Study  304 
and the US-only Study 304, eligible patients were switched to a 5 mg/day vortioxetine dose. After the 
first week, the dose was flexible (2.5, 5 or 10mg/day) based on the patient’s tolerability to treatment, 
as judged by the investigator. 
The mean MADRS total score decreased from 16.6 to 9.3 points and the mean CGI-S score decreased 
from  3.2  to  2.2  points  from  Baseline  II  to  the  final  visit,  indicating  maintained  improvement  in 
depressive symptoms and the global impression during the extension study. 
Study 13267B is the long-term, open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as 
well as the maintenance of the therapeutic effect, of vortioxetine at flexible doses of 15 or 20mg/day 
over 52 weeks in patients with MDD who had completed lead-in Study 13267A. 
Lead-in study 13267A was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, duloxetine-
referenced, fixed-dose study evaluating the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine 15 and 20mg/day in the 
acute treatment of adult patients with MDD. A total of 607 patients were randomized equally (1:1:1:1) 
to  placebo,  vortioxetine  15  or  20  mg/day,  or  duloxetine  for  8  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment.  The 
number  of  patients  who  completed  the  lead-in  study  was  lower  in  the  vortioxetine  15  or  20  mg/day 
treatment groups (77% and 83%, resp.) than for the duloxetine and placebo treatment groups (89% 
and 84%, resp.). In total, 506 patients completed the lead-in study. 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  essentially  the  same  as  those  in  the  other  short-term  MDD 
studies, for subjects who had completed the 10 Week lead-in study.  
The continuation study was originally planned to follow the safety and tolerability of 300 subjects, but 
only 71 were enrolled. Results obtained from a small population is not statistically significant and could 
be influenced by selection bias among the subjects who initially enrolled for the lead-in study, and who 
finally enrolled in the continuation study.  
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  flexible  doses  of 
vortioxetine (15 and 20 mg/day) over a period of 52 weeks in patients with MDD who have completed 
the lead-in Study 13267A. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the therapeutic effect of flexible 
doses of vortioxetine (15 and 20 mg/day) over a period of 52 weeks in patients with MDD as assessed

by Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression – Severity of 
Illness  (CGI-S),  and  Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A).  Due  to  the  open-label  design  of  the 
study, the efficacy and health-related quality of life and overall functioning measures were considered 
exploratory and the results are presented using descriptive statistics. 
The assessment of the long-term efficacy was considered as a secondary objective for this study. The 
results  showed  an  improvement  of  depressive  symptoms  irrespective  of  previous  treatment  (on 
average,  the  MADRS  total  score  decreased  10  points  from  Baseline  II  to  Week  52).  The  highest 
improvement  was  observed  in  the  group  of  previously  placebo-treated  patients  while  the  less 
important  changes  were  seen  in  the  groups  of  patients  previously  treated  with  vortioxetine  (20  mg) 
and  duloxetine.  The  analysis  of  other  efficacy  measures  (HAM-A,  CGI-S)  showed  also  better 
improvement for the previously placebo-treated patients.  
The results should be interpreted very cautiously because of the low number of subjects, the potential 
selection  bias,  and  the  open-label  nature  of  the  design.  The  studies  are  inconclusive  as  to  the 
maintenance of the clinical effect. The mean MADRS total score at Week 52 was about 5 indicating that 
on  average,  remission  (MADRS≤10)  was  achieved  in  the  patient  population.  However,  the  minimum 
and maximum values of the MADRS total score were 0 and 20, resp. This indicates that after one year 
treatment,  some  patients  were  total  remitters  (MADRS  score  of  0)  whereas  others  remained 
depressed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Twelve  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  6/8-week,  fixed-dose  studies  have  been  conducted  to 
investigate the short-term efficacy of vortioxetine in MDD in adults (including the elderly).  
Three  main  studies  demonstrated  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  in  adults  based  on  decreasing  scores  on 
depression  scales  such  as  MADRS  and  HAM-D.  These  studies  involved  the  5  mg  and  10  mg  dose 
(11492A, 305) and the 15 mg and 20 mg dose (13267A) and were all performed outside the US. 
In  addition,  one  dedicated  study  demonstrated  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  5  mg  in  patients  ≥65  years 
(12541A). This study was performed both in- and outside the US.  
The  results  of  the  primary  endpoints  were  confirmed  by  CGI-I  scores  and  responder  and  remitter 
analyses.  
Short-term  efficacy  (at  6  or  8  weeks)  of  the  recommended  10  mg  dose  was  demonstrated  in  two  of 
four short-term pivotal trials which were able to discriminate vortioxetine from placebo. Two of these 
four  trials  (11492A  and  11984A)  included  an  active  comparator  arm  (venlafaxine  225  mg  and 
duloxetine  60  mg,  resp.)  but  one  trial  failed  (11984A).  In  this  latter  trial,  the  effect  of  neither 
vortioxetine nor duloxetine was better than placebo in the primary LOCF analysis. However, the MMRM 
analysis  showed  a  separation  (p<0.05)  from  placebo  in  favour  of  vortioxetine  5  and  10  mg/day  and 
duloxetine,  but  not  for  vortioxetine  2.5  mg/day,  which  was  slightly  above  the  clinical  relevant  effect 
size  of  2  (2.5,  2.6  and  3  points  for  vortioxetine  2.5,2.6  and  duloxetine,  respectively).  The  other  two 
trials were placebo-controlled trials (305 and 316) but one did not show superiority over placebo and is 
therefore considered negative (316). 
The  inclusion  of  3  additional  short-term  studies  to  the  initial  meta-analysis  of  8  short-term  studies 
generally resulted in lower overall effect sizes in the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Looking 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 121/159 
 
  
 
at  the  global  data  package,  the  effect  sizes  of  vortioxetine  treatment  are  lower  than  previously 
estimated on the basis of the 8 short-term studies but still separate statistically from placebo.  
No  specific  dose  adjustments  are  considered  necessary  based  on  patient´s  age  alone.  However, 
caution  should  be  exercised  when  treating  the  elderly  especially  with  doses  higher  than  10  mg  for 
which data are limited. The lowest effective dose of 5 mg should always be used as starting dose and 
patients should be carefully monitored when an increase in dose is required. 
One  relapse  prevention  study  was  performed,  whereby  responders  to  vortioxetine  after  12  weeks  of 
open  label  treatment  were  randomised  between  vortioxetine  and  placebo.  The  study  demonstrated  a 
statistically  significant  difference  in  time  to  relapse  between  vortioxetine  and  placebo,  in  favour  of 
vortioxetine.  No  difference  in  efficacy  between  severely  depressed  patients  and  patients  with 
moderate/mild depression was found.  
In  some  of  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  an  active  reference  was  included  as  internal  control. 
Although no formal comparison was conducted, , numerically larger effect sizes were observed for the 
active  reference  than  for  Vortioxetine,  except  in  Studies  11492A  and  11984A.  The  exclusion  of  non-
responders and the inclusion of previous responders in the active reference arm could have introduced 
a  bias  in  favour  of  the  efficacy  of  the  active  reference,  so  differences  in  the  efficacy  of  Vortioxetine 
versus the active reference cannot be inferred on the basis of these studies. 
The long-term studies aimed at investigating clinical safety rather than efficacy and did not include a 
placebo control. The studies suggest maintenance of the clinical effect. The mean MADRS total score at 
Week 52 was about 5 indicating that, on average, remission (MADRS≤10) was achieved in the patient 
population.  However,  the  minimum  and  maximum  values  of  the  MADRS  total  score  were  0  and  20, 
resp. This indicates that after one year treatment, some patients were total remitters (MADRS score of 
0) whereas others remained depressed . 
To summarise: 
-  Vortioxetine 1 mg/day was efficacious in the one study in which it was investigated. 
-  Vortioxetine  2.5  mg/day  was  not  efficacious  in  either  of  the  two  studies  in  which  it  was 
investigated. 
-  Vortioxetine 5 mg/day was efficacious in five of the eight studies: the results were positive in 
four  studies  (two  short-term  studies  in  adult patients,  the dedicated  study in  the elderly,  and 
the  relapse-prevention  study)  and  supportive  in  a  fifth  study  as  reflected  by  additional 
sensitivity  analyses  in  adult  patients;  no  effect  was  observed  in  three  short-term  studies  in 
adult patients.  
-  Vortioxetine  10  mg/day  was  efficacious  in  seven  of  the  eight  studies  in  which  it  was 
investigated:  the  results  were  positive  in  four  studies  (three  short-term  studies  and  the 
relapse-prevention  study)  and  supportive  in  the  remaining  three  studies  as  reflected  by 
additional sensitivity analyses. 
-  Vortioxetine 15 mg/day was efficacious in one of the three studies in which it was investigated. 
-  Vortioxetine  20  mg/day  was  efficacious  in  all  five  studies  in  which  it  was  investigated;  the 
results were positive in four studies and supportive in one study.

It  can  therefore  be  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  was  demonstrated  with  at  least  one 
dosage  group  across  9 of  the  12  studies,  showing  at  least  a  2-point  difference  to  placebo  in  the 
Montgomery  and  Åsberg  Depression  Rating  Scale  (MADRS)  or  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  24-
item (HAM-D24) total score. The clinical relevance of the effects were supported by the proportions of 
responders and remitters and the improvement in the Clinical Global Impression – Global Improvement 
(CGI-I) score. The efficacy of vortioxetine increased with increasing dose.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety was investigated initially on the basis of data from 13 completed phase II/III studies 
in major depressive disorder (MDD). 
An updated clinical safety database was provided by the Applicant with a new data cut-off as of 31st of 
August  2013.  Overall,  the  updated  safety  database  comprises  18  completed  phase  II/III  studies  in 
patients with MDD.  
The reference treatments used in the safety clinical studies were either placebo, duloxetine (60 mg/d), 
venlafaxine (225 mg/d) or agomelatine (25-50 mg/d). 
Patient exposure 
The therapeutic dose range of Vortioxetine varies from 5 to 20 mg according to the proposed SmPC.  
With respect to clinical pharmacology studies, 1169 subjects were exposed to Vortioxetine (solution or 
tablets) as a single dose (up to 75 mg) or repeated doses (up to 60 mg/d) calculated to 31.7 patient-
years  of  exposure.  An  additional  74  subjects  were  reported  as  update  of  the  original  pharmacology 
studies  (ntotal=  1243).  Subjects  were  either  healthy,  elderly  or  suffered  from  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment. 
Patient exposure in the short-term pools (MDD short-term pool and MDD & GAD short-term pool) 
MDD short-term Pool: 
The 13 short-term studies included 3904 MDD patients exposed to Vortioxetine in a dose range from 1 
to 20 mg per day with around 89% of subjects exposed to doses of 5 to 20 mg per day. The number of 
patients  accounted  for  527.5  p  atient-years  of  exposure.  1968  patients  were exposed to  placebo  and 
866  subjects  to  active  comparators  (n=  753  for  duloxetine  and  n=  113  for  venlafaxine).  As  of  the 
original  data  cut-off  (29th  February  2012),  67%  of  patients  treated  with  Vortioxetine  were  women, 
about 11% of patients were 65 years of age and older and 81% were Caucasians. 
MDD and GAD short-term Pool: 
All completed short-term trials included 4972 patients exposed to Vortioxetine (671.5 patient-years of 
exposure), either suffering from MDD or GAD. 85% of the Vortioxetine patients received doses of 5 to 
20  mg/day.  2577  patients  were  exposed  to  placebo,  113  patients  received  venlafaxine  and  907 
patients were exposed to duloxetine. Evaluation on the demographics sex, age and race was similar to 
the MDD short-term pool.  
MDD long-term relapse prevention study 11985A 
The long-term relapse-prevention study included 639 patients on Vortioxetine (127.5 patient-years of 
exposure) during the open-label period (12 weeks). 204 patients were exposed to Vortioxetine during 
the  double-blind  period  (116  patient-years  of  exposure).  Patients  received  either  5  or  10  mg  of 
Vortioxetine. Demographics were similar to those evaluated in the short-term studies. 
GAD long-term relapse prevention study 12473A 
The long-term relapse-prevention study included 687 patients on Vortioxetine (222.9 patient-years of 
exposure) during the open-label period (20 weeks). 229 patients were exposed to Vortioxetine during 
the  double-blind  period  (123  patient-years  of  exposure).  Patients  received  either  5  or  10  mg  of 
Vortioxetine. Demographics were similar to those evaluated in the short-term studies.

MDD open-label long-term pool 
1443  patients  from  the  nine  short-term  studies  continued  in  the  open-label  long-term  extension 
studies  301,  11492C  and  11984B  with  flexible  doses  of  Vortioxetine  2.5  mg  to  10  mg/day  (including 
560  patients,  who  were  on  placebo  or  active  control  in  the  short-term  studies).  These  subjects 
accounted for 1097 patient-years of exposure.  
1105  patients  on  Vortioxetine  had  an  exposure  of  6  months  and  more  and  845  patients  were  on 
Vortioxetine  for  at  least  12  months.  There  is  no  information  on  the  number  of  subjects  receiving  2.5 
mg, 5 mg and 10 mg for ≥ 6 and ≥ 12 months from the study reports.  
MDD ongoing open-label long-term pool 
Studies 13267B and 314 belong to the pool of ongoing studies and as of 26th of October 2012, 1144 
patients  had  been  exposed  to  15  or  20  mg/day  of Vortioxetine  (813  patient-years  of  exposure).  391 
patients had ≥ 52 weeks of exposure.  
The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety (ICH CPMP/ICH/375/95) is adequate: ICH 
E1 guidance requests data from 300 to 600 patients treated for 6 months at dosage levels intended for 
clinical  use:  528  patients  received  5  mg,  861  patients  received  10  mg,  258  patients  received  15  mg 
and 524 patients received 20 mg Vortioxetine up to 26th of October 2012. About 100 patients should 
receive  the  drug  at  dosage  levels  intended  for  clinical  use  for  more  at  least  one  year.  This  has  been 
adequately  fulfilled  for  each  dose  level  (e.g.  124  patients  with  15  mg  and  270  patients  with  20  mg 
Vortioxetine).  
Strategy of the overall safety evaluation: 
-  Clinical  pharmacology  integrated  safety  database  including  healthy  patients  and  patients 
with renal or hepatic impairment to evaluate safety and tolerability of Vortioxetine. 
- 
Integrated  safety  database  from  the  phase  II/III  studies  allowing  pooling  and  comparing 
safety  data.  The  primary  pool  for  the  evaluation  of  the  short-term  safety  and  tolerability 
was the MDD short-term pool, supported by the MDD&GAD short-term pool. 
Other studies in MDD and GAD have not been pooled, mainly due to a different study design 
and are therefore presented individually. 
Pooling of studies as proposed by the applicant and separation of other studies due to a different study 
design (relapse-prevention studies) is reasonable.  
Of  note,  studies  317,  CCT-002,  14122A,  and  14178A  were  completed  by  the  new  data  cut  off  31st 
August 2013, and updates on safety variables are given wherever applicable. 
Patient disposition and withdrawals 
Patient disposition revealed an overall consistent picture for the short-term pool with withdrawal rates 
of 16-23% (doses 5 to 20 mg) and for the MDD long-term pool with discontinuations between 37 and 
46%.  A  slightly  higher  number  (46%)  of  subjects  withdrew  from  the  ongoing  open-label  long-term 
pool.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  treatment  were  adverse  events  and  lack  of 
efficacy. In the ongoing MDD open-label long-term pool, withdrawal of consent was the most common 
reason  for  withdrawal  (11%).  Fewer  patients  on  VORTIOXETINE  withdrew  from  the  short-term  pools 
due to lack of efficacy (1.9%) compared to long-term open-label pools (5 to 6%). Discontinuation due 
to adverse events during vortioxetine treatment varied less in all pools (5 to11%).

Demographic and baseline characteristics (referring to the initially submitted studies) 
As  was  expected  in  this  disorder,  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  patients  were  women  in  the  short-
term  pools,  the  MDD long-term  pool  and the  relapse-prevention  studies.  The majority  of the  patients 
were  Caucasian.  Patients  receiving  duloxetine  as  active  comparator  were  slightly  older  (49.6  ±  16 
years), at least 78%. 
MDD short-term pool: 
In  the  MDD  short-term  pool,  the  mean  age  was  46  years  in  the  placebo  group  and  in  the 
VORTIOXETINE Total group (range: 18 to 88 years [18 to 85 in the placebo group]). Patients receiving 
duloxetine as active comparator were slightly older (49.6 ± 16 years). A higher proportion of patients 
in the placebo group than in the VORTIOXETINE Total group were ≥65 years old (14% versus 10%). In 
the MDD short-term pool, only 30 patients (1.1 %) in the VORTIOXETINE groups were aged ≥75 year, 
290 (10.5%) ≥65 year. The VORTIOXETINE 5 mg/day group was studied in elderly, resulting in a 2.6% 
of the population being ≥75 years of age and 19.4% ≥65 (including ≥75) for the 5 mg/day group. In 
the 10, 15 and 20 mg groups, only 1 patient in each group was ≥75 year. Adding the GAD short-term 
pool resulted in the age distribution by dose in (Table ). 
Table 15: Age distribution by dose in the MDD-GAD short-term pool (APTS) 
The  mean  baseline  weight  and  BMI  in  the  MDD  short-term  pool  were  similar  in  the  placebo  and 
VORTIOXETINE  Total  groups  (80  and  79kg  and  29  and  28kg/m2,  respectively).  The  proportion  of 
patients with a BMI <25kg/m2 was lower in the placebo group than in the VORTIOXETINE Total group 
(34%  and  38%,  respectively),  consequently,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  BMI  ≥30kg/m2  was 
higher in the placebo group than in the VORTIOXETINE Total group (35% and 31%, respectively). In 
the VORTIOXETINE 10mg/day group the proportion of patients with a BMI <25kg/m2 was higher than 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 127/159 
 
 
 
  
 
in the VORTIOXETINE Total group (43% and 38%, respectively). The VORTIOXETINE 20 mg/day group 
had  a  higher  mean  and  median  BMI  and  a  higher  population  with  a  BMI  above  30  kg/m2  than  the 
VORTIOXETINE Total group (39% and 31%, respectively). 
Nearly  30  %  were  current  smokers,  approximately  15%  has  a  diagnosis  of  hypertension  and  3%  of 
diabetes mellitus type I or II. For nearly 60% of the patients the baseline LDL cholesterol was above 
the reference range. 
In  the  MDD  long-term  relapse-prevention  study,  the  mean  age  was  45  years,  ranging  from  18  to  75 
years  (18  to  74  years  in  the  Double-blind  Period).  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in 
weight or BMI between the placebo and VORTIOXETINE groups. Mean BMI for the FAS was 27 kg/m² 
for the placebo group and 26 kg/m² for the VORTIOXETINE group. 
In  the  GAD  long-term  relapse-prevention  study,  the  mean  age  was  44  years,  ranging  from  18  to  75 
years. There were no clinically relevant differences in weight or BMI between the VORTIOXETINE and 
placebo groups. 
In the open-label long-term pool, the mean age was 45 years, and 6% (n=83) of the patients were ≥
65 years old and only 3 patients were ≥75 years old. The mean baseline BMI was 27kg/m2 (range: 16 
to 58kg/m2). 
For  the  MDD  short-term  pool,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  concurrent  disorders  at  baseline  were 
similar in the placebo and VORTIOXETINE groups (72% and 69%, respectively), ranging from 65% to 
72%  in  the  therapeutic  VORTIOXETINE  dose  groups.  At  baseline,  the  most  common  concurrent 
disorders  in  all  groups  (occurring  in  ≥20%  of  the  patients  in  any  group)  were  in  the  following  SOCs 
(placebo versus VORTIOXETINE): musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (23% vs. 21%) and 
nervous system disorders (23% vs. 20%). For the MDD and GAD short-term pool, numbers of patients 
with concurrent disorders at baseline were similar to the MDD short-term pool. 
In the MDD long-term relapse-prevention study (and similarly in the GAD long-term relapse-prevention 
study), 64% of the patients had concurrent disorders. The three most common concurrent disorders at 
baseline  were  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (16%,  mainly  hypercholesterolemia  and  obesity), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (16%, mainly back pain and osteoarthritis), and social 
circumstances  (16%,  mainly  menopause).  In  addition,  nervous  system  disorders  (13%,  mainly 
headache  and  migraine)  and  vascular  disorders  (12%,  mainly  hypertension)  affected  substantial 
proportions of patients at baseline. 
The  most  common  concurrent  disorders  for  patients  in  the  MDD  Open-label  Long-term  Pool 
(Vortioxetine  2.5  to  10mg/day)  (≥10%)  by  preferred  term  were:  hypertension  (15%),  headache 
(12%), and menopause (10%). 
The  most  common  concurrent  disorders  for  patients  in  the  MDD  Ongoing  Open-label  Long-term  Pool 
(Vortioxetine  15  to  20mg/day)  (≥10%)  by  preferred  term  were:  headache  (26%),  seasonal  allergy 
(20%), hypertension (17%), drug hypersensitivity (13%), insomnia (13%), and back pain (11%). 
The  short-term  safety  in  the  elderly  has  been  investigated  in  study  12541A,  using  5  mg/day  of 
VORTIOXETINE.  
In  the  MDD  and  GAD  short-term  pool  (data  cut-off  26th  October  2012),  only  38  patients  in  the 
VORTIOXETINE therapeutic dose groups (5 to 20mg/day)  were aged ≥75 year, 313 patients were ≥65 
years of age although depression is a common disorder in the over 65. The number of elderly patients 
≥75 year was very low in the 10, 15 and 20 mg groups, with 8 patients in the 10 mg group, but only 1 
patient in the 15 and 20 mg group. The number of patients ≥65 in the 10, 15 and 20 mg groups were 
39, 21 and 31 respectively.

In the MDD and GAD long-term relapse-prevention studies, the mean age was 45 years and no patient 
was older than 75. In the open-label long-term pool (VORTIOXETINE 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/day), 6% (n=83) 
of the patients were ≥65 years old, of which only 3 patients were ≥75 years. 
Overall,  in  the  elderly  population  ≥  65,  249  patients  with  MDD  or  GAD  received  VORTIOXETINE  5 
mg/day,  111  patients  10  mg/day,  21  patients  15  mg/day  and  42  patients  20  mg/day.  A  pooled 
analysis of the clinical safety data in elderly by dose is missing. 
In  the  long-term  studies,  37  patients  were  treated  with  the  5  mg  dose,  56  with  the  10  mg  dose,  14 
with the 15 mg dose and 24 with the 20 mg dose in elderly of 65 - ≤75 years. Only 7 patients of 75 
and older have been included. Safety data for the 15 and 20 mg/day dose are limited. 
Use of vortioxetine in patients aged ≥75 years is scarce.  
The  Applicant  will  initiate  a  post-authorisation  safety  study  (PASS)  where  the  frequency  of  certain 
important  potential  risks  will  be  assessed.  Patients  with  these  events  will  be  further  characterised  by 
dose  and  age  (among  others),  which  will  provide  further  information  on  safety  in  elderly  patients  for 
the higher doses of 15 and 20 mg/day vortioxetine. 
The SmPC has been adapted to reflect the limited data in the elderly population: The lowest effective 
dose of 5 mg should always be used as starting dose and patients should be carefully monitored when 
an increase in dose is required (see section 4.4). Particular caution should be exercised when treating 
elderly patients with doses higher than 10 mg/day for which data are limited.  
Regarding  BMI,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  Vortioxetine  are  substantially 
different  between  patients  with  a  BMI  <25  or  ≥30kg/m2.  There  are  minor  imbalances  in  the 
distribution  across  baseline  BMI  categories  between  the  Vortioxetine  10  and  20mg  groups  and  the 
other treatment groups, but there is no consistent trend in terms of the nature of the adverse events 
or major differences in the incidences between the BMI categories. 
Adverse events 
Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  occurring  with  VORTIOXETINE  have  been  analysed  for 
each pool. 
TEAEs in the Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
Clinical  pharmacology  studies  were  pooled  for evaluation  of  TEAEs  and  doses  of  VORTIOXETINE  were 
combined  against  placebo  and  “other  substances”.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  percentage  of  TEAEs 
were gastrointestinal disorders (total VORTIOXETINE: 35.6% vs. placebo 14.2%) and nervous system 
disorders (total VORTIOXETINE: 26.2% vs. placebo 14.9%) followed by skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (total VORTIOXETINE: 17.4% vs. placebo 15.3%). Preferred terms most often mentioned for 
subjects on VORTIOXETINE (≥ 10%) were: nausea (20%), headache (19%), and diarrhoea (13%). 
Thorough QT study 104 evaluated the effect of VORTIOXETINE on cardiac repolarisation (presented in 
detail in section adverse events of special interest).  
Single-  and  multiple  ascending  dose  studies  10272  (healthy  men;  10/20/30/50/75  mg)  and  10467 
(healthy men with 20/40/60 mg and healthy women with single doses of 60 mg, followed by washout 
and  12  days  of  exposure  to  VORTIOXETINE  40  mg)  investigated  the  maximum  tolerated  doses  of 
VORTIOXETINE in healthy young men and women. A cohort of elderly men and women was included in 
study 10467. Additional panels explored the tolerability of VORTIOXETINE at doses of 10 to 40mg/day 
by  titration  in  8  young  women  and  at  lower  doses  of  2.5  and  5mg/day  in  16  young  women  over  a 
longer  period  (25  days).  In  addition,  8  elderly  men  and  women  (aged  >65  years)  received 
VORTIOXETINE 20mg first as a single dose followed by washout and then at 20mg/day for 12 days.

As the most important results, single doses of VORTIOXETINE 60mg led to nausea and flushing in all 
women.  Also,  diarrhoea  and  abdominal  discomfort  were  reported  at  high  incidences  (67%)  at  the 
60mg dose. Tolerability of 40mg/d was not acceptable in women. This fact is referred to in section 4.8 
of  the  SmPC.  Elderly  volunteers  tolerated  maximum  doses  of  20mg/d  with  TEAEs  of  procedural  site 
reactions, headache, and sleep disorder as most common adverse events.  
Adverse  events  reported  for  these  three  completed  studies  clinical  pharmacology  studies  14520A, 
14029A,  and  CPH-004,  as  of  data  cut  off  31st  of  August  2013  were  in  line  with  those  previously 
reported in the other studies, and most frequently mentioning AEs of gastrointestinal origin. No SAEs 
have been reported. 
TEAEs in phase II/III short-term pools 
MDD short-term pool (updated) 
Updated information on MDD short-term pool, including studies 317, 14122A, and CCT-002: 
In  the  updated  MDD  Short-term  Pool,  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  for  Vortioxetine  was  similar  at 
5mg/day  (65%),  10mg/day  (61%),  15mg/day  (69%)  and  20mg/day  (65%);  the  incidences  in  the 
placebo  and  duloxetine  groups  were  58%  and  76%.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidences  of  TEAEs 
were  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  nervous  system  disorders.  The  two  preferred  terms  with  the 
highest  incidences  were  nausea  (ranging  from  21  31%  for  5  to  20  mg/day)  and  headache  (ranging 
from 12 to 15% for 5 to 20 mg/day but similar to placebo 13%). 
In general, the incidences of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation were slightly higher 
for VORTIOXETINE than for placebo and slightly higher at 15 and 20mg/day than at 5 and 10mg/day. 
34% of duloxetine-and venlafaxine- treated subjects reported nausea in the short-term pool.  
In  contrast  to  duloxetine,  VORTIOXETINE  was  not  associated  with  insomnia,  somnolence,  fatigue,  or 
hyperhidrosis. 
Among  the  less  frequent  TEAEs,  abnormal  dreams,  decreased  appetite,  pruritus  generalised, 
and  influenza  had  an  incidence  ≥2%  and  at  least  twice  that  for  placebo  at  one  or  more  of  the 
VORTIOXETINE therapeutic doses. 
Most  of  the  TEAEs  reported  in  the  updated  MDD  short-term  pool  are  not  dose-related  (e.g.  nausea, 
headache, dizziness, etc.). 
Study  14178A  revealed  overall  consistence  with  the  aforementioned  results  from  the  short-term 
studies:  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  (55%  and  53%  in  the 
Vortioxetine  and  agomelatine  groups,  respectively).  Nausea  occurred  with  a  higher  incidence  in  the 
Vortioxetine  group  compared  to  the  agomelatine  group  (16%  and  9%,  respectively).  All  other  TEAEs 
with an incidence ≥5% had a higher incidence in the agomelatine group than in the Vortioxetine group 
and comprised headache (10% in the Vortioxetine group and 13% in the agomelatine group), dizziness 
(7%  in  the  Vortioxetine  group  and  12%  in  the  agomelatine  group),  and  somnolence  (4%  in  the 
Vortioxetine group and 8% in the agomelatine group). 
MDD&GAD short-term pool 
The pattern of TEAEs, incidences and severities were similar to that in the MDD short-term studies. 
TEAEs in long-term relapse-prevention  
MDD long-term relapse-prevention study 11985A

EMA/699150/2013 
Page 130/159 
 
  
 
During  the  open-label  phase  of  this  study,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  70.6%.  Again,  the  SOCs  with 
the  highest  reporting  rate  of  TEAEs  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  nervous  system  disorders. 
Nausea  was  reported  in  26%  of  patients  followed  by  headache  in  18%  of  patients.  All  other  TEAEs 
were  reported  in  less  than  10%  of  patients.  Of  note,  5.8%  of  patients  reported  a  TEAE  of  accidental 
overdose.  
The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity with 13% of TEAEs being classified as severe. 
Severe TEAEs were headache and nausea (1.6% each), and accidental overdose (1.3%). 
The  overall  adverse  event  rate  in  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  study  was  similar  for  placebo  and 
VORTIOXETINE-treated subjects (63.5% and 62.3%). The SOCs with the highest occurrence of TEAEs 
were  infections  and  infestations,  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  nervous  system  disorders.  Preferred 
terms in the infection and infestation SOC occurred in a similar number in placebo and VORTIOXETINE-
treated  subjects  (nasopharyngitis:  14  and  11%;  influenza:  5  and  7%;  gastroenteritis:  3  and  2%). 
Nausea was reported nearly three times higher in the VORTIOXETINE  group compared to placebo (9 
and  3  %).  Headache  was  similar  in  placebo  and  active  treatment  (13  and  12%),  and  accidental 
overdose  was  reported  in  8%  of  placebo  and  VORTIOXETINE-treated  patients  each.  The  majority  of 
events  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  with  10%  of  TEAEs  being  classified  as  severe  in  both 
treatment groups. 
A  relatively  high  reporting  rate  of  “accidental  overdose”  in  study  11985A  was  explained  by  the 
Applicant to be caused by protocol amendment recording each overdose (accidental or intentional) at 
least  as  an  adverse  event.  The  cases  depicted  by  the  Applicant  did  not  raise  concern  of 
intentional/suicidal background and events are similarly distributed between placebo and Vortioxetine. 
GAD long-term relapse prevention study 12473A 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  in  the  open-label  period  of  this  study  was  77%  with  gastrointestinal 
disorders,  nervous  system  disorders,  and  infections  and  infestations  being  the  SOCs  with  the  highest 
percentage  of  TEAEs  (43%,  30%,  and  24%).  Preferred  terms,  which  contribute  to  these  SOC  rates, 
were  nausea  (27.1%),  headache  (17.6%),  and  influenza  (7.6%).  Results  are  very  similar  to  those 
observed in the MDD long-term relapse-prevention study. 
The  overall  adverse  event  rate  in  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  study  was  similar  for  placebo  and 
VORTIOXETINE-treated  subjects  (53.9%  and  55%). Infections  and  infestations  was  the  SOC  with  the 
highest  rate  of  TEAEs  in  both  groups  placebo  and  VORTIOXETINE  (23%  and  23.6%).  Twice  as  many 
subjects on VORTIOXETINE  had an AE of influenza compared to placebo (12.2 vs. 6.1%). 
TEAEs in the MDD open-label long-term pool  
71.2%  of  patients  included  in  this  study  had  TEAEs.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  percentage  of  TEAEs 
were  gastrointestinal  disorders  (33.1%),  infections  and  infestations  (29.5%),  and  nervous  system 
disorders  (24.3%).  Nausea  (17.5%),  headache  (13.2%)  and  nasopharyngitis  (10.5%)  were  the  most 
common preferred terms. During the first two weeks of open-label treatment, the incidence of nausea 
was  lower  in  patients,  who  continued  treatment  with  VORTIOXETINE  (6%  to  9%)  than  those,  who 
switched from other treatments to VORTIOXETINE (15% to 18%) when entering the extension study. 
TEAEs in the ongoing MDD open-label long-term pool  
At the cut-off date of 26 October 2012, 78.5% of patients included in this pool had TEAEs. The SOCs 
with  the  highest  percentage  of  TEAEs  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  (41.2%),  infections  and 
infestations  (30.2%),  and  nervous  system  disorders  (26.8%).  The  TEAEs  with  the  highest  incidences 
(≥10%) were nausea (24%) and headache (13%).

To summarize, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 
the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders and Nervous System disorders regardless of the different pools. 
Clinical pharmacology studies, short-term MDD, short-term MDD and GAD, relapse-prevention studies 
in  MDD  and  GAD  and  open-label  long-term  treatment  with  VORTIOXETINE  gave  an  overall  similar 
pattern of adverse events.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  during  short-term  and  long-term  treatment  that  occurred  in  ≥10%  of 
VORTIOXETINE-treated patients were nausea and headache. The incidence for nausea was constantly 
two- to three-fold greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients and dose-related (up to 21 – 
31% of subjects in the MDD short-term pool). 
Headache (up to 20%) and dizziness (< 10%) were most often mentioned within the nervous system 
disorder SOC and also dose-related. Incidences were only slightly lower for placebo-treated subjects.  
Most of the TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Severe adverse events were reported in a similar 
range in placebo and VORTIOXETINE-treated subjects (about 5-6%). 
MDD  short-term  Pool  studies  serve  as  a  basis  for  ADRs  with  a  total  of  3904  patients  treated  with 
Vortioxetine  up  to  20  mg/day  and  with  1968  patients  receiving  placebo.  The  causal  relationship  of 
adverse  events  attributed  to  Vortioxetine  was  determined  by  a  dose-response  relationship  or  an 
incidence of ≥ 1.5-times compared to placebo. Allocation to the respective frequency columns followed 
the SmPC guidance.  
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Patients  with  a  significant  risk  of  suicide  were  excluded  from  the  VORTIOXETINE  clinical 
development programme. 
Suicidal ideation and self-injurious behaviour during treatment with VORTIOXETINE in the phase II/III 
studies  was  investigated  based  on  TEAEs  captured  using  the  SMQ  Suicide/Selfinjury.  In  addition, 
suicidal ideation and behaviour was captured prospectively using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale  (C-SSRS)  in  3  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  811  phase  II/III  studies  in  MDD,  and  5  phase  III 
studies  in  GAD  assessed  suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour  using  the  C-SSRS.  The  C-SSRS  scores  (1  to 
10) were mapped into the Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C-CASA). 
In  the  clinical  development  programme  for  Vortioxetine,  1  completed  suicide  and  9  suicide  attempts 
have been reported in patients treated with Vortioxetine, corresponding to an overall incidence of fatal 
and non-fatal suicide attempts of 0.34 per 100 PYE (95% CI: 0.16; 0.62). 
Suicidality was evaluated for all pools and in terms of TEAEs and also using a validated rating scale. As 
a result, TEAEs with respect to suicide/self-injury (SMQ) were considered spontaneous and therefore, 
percentages were lower compared to rating scale results.  
In the updated short-term MDD studies (and similarly during short-term MDD and GAD studies), 0.4% 
of Vortioxetine- and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients reported TEAEs of suicidal ideation. This number 
was slightly increased in the MDD open-label long-term pool (0.5%).  
Suicide  attempts  did  occur  in  the  Vortioxetine  group  in  the  MDD  short-term  pool  (n=4),  in  the  MDD 
relapse-prevention  study  (n=1),  in  one  patient  from  the  MDD  open-label  long-term  pool,  in  two 
patients  from  the  MDD  ongoing  open-label  long-term  pool  and  in  one  placebo-treated  subjectin  the 
MDD short-term pool One completed suicide was reported in the clinical study program.  
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 132/159 
 
  
 
When using the C-SSRS, suicidal ideation was reported for 14.5% of Vortioxetine-treated patients and 
16%  of  placebo-treated  patients  in  the  updated  MDD  short-term  studies  (MDD  and  GAD  short-term 
studies).  Elderly  patients  seemed  to  be  at  lower  risk  for  suicidal  ideation  (12%  for  Vortioxetine  vs. 
10%  for  placebo).  MDD  open-label  long-term  study  301  showed  a  slight  decrease  in  patients  with 
suicidal ideation (9.6%) and during GAD long-term relapse-prevention study 12473A, suicidal ideation 
decreased to 2% in Vortioxetine-treated patients (vs. 3.5% placebo) during the double-blind phase of 
the  study.  Suicidal  behaviour  occurred  in  1.3%  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  in  0.4%  of 
Vortioxetine-treated subjects. 
Suicidal  ideation  differs  between  MDD  and  GAD  studies  (lower  incidence  in  GAD  studies  compared  to 
MDD studies) suggesting the underlying disease to be the main reason for these events. The fact, that 
all  of  the  reported  suicide  attempts  happened  in  MDD  patients,  is  in  support  of  this  assumption. 
Nevertheless,  since  suicidality  is  considered  a  class  effect  of  antidepressant  medication,  close 
monitoring of suicidal events is needed. Since suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour is a class effect 
known  for  SSRIs,  SNRIs,  and  TCAs,  it  is  implemented  in  the  risk  management  plan  as  important 
potential risk.  
Further adverse events of special interest 
Across the clinical study program, 2 patients had convulsions (in both cases there was an alternative 
aetiology). 
The potential risk for convulsions in people with a history of convulsions is included in the SmPC. 
One  patient  in  the  VORTIOXETINE  groups  had  a  mild  episode  of  serotonin  syndrome  (without 
neuromuscular rigidity and hyperthermia, which characterise life-threatening episodes). 
No additional case of seizure or serotonin syndrome was reported in the additional 1656 patients from 
the updated MDD short-term pool. The clinical presentation of serotonin syndrome is variable and often 
aspecific,  diagnosing  serotonin  syndrome  can  be  challenging,  particularly  in  mild  cases.  Therefore, 
serotonin syndrome remains a potential risk. 
However,  there  is  evidence  that  antidepressants  could  contribute  to  the  occurrence  of  neuroleptic 
malignant  syndrome  (Heinemann  F.,  Assion  H.-J.,  Laux  G.  1997).  For  serotonine-accented 
antidepressants, this could be explained by inhibitory effects on central dopaminergic neurones due to 
increased 5-HT activity. As a consequence, several SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine) include a warning in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The Applicant has added a warning on neuroleptic malignant syndrome, too. 
Switching  from  depressive  symptoms  to  mania  or  hypomania  during  antidepressant  therapy  has 
been reported and caution is generally advised when treating patients who have bipolar disorder or a 
history of mania. Patients with a history of mania or hypomania were excluded from all the studies in 
the  VORTIOXETINE  development  programme.  In  the  updated  MDD  short-term  pool,  the  incidence  of 
TEAEs  captured  in  the  SMQ  Hostility/Aggression  was  similar  in  the  placebo  group  (2.8%)  and  the 
VORTIOXETINE total group (1.9%). 
Patients with a history of mania or hypomania were excluded from studies.  
However, current clinical data do not indicate a switch to or induction of mania/hypomania. Therefore, 
patients  with  a  history  of  mania/hypomania  may  be  included  as  a  target  population.  However, 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 133/159 
 
 
  
 
VORTIOXETINE  should  be used  with  caution  in  this population  and  should  be discontinued in  patients 
entering a manic phase. A warning is added to section 4.4. 
The  PASS  will  provide  more  information  on  the  use,  efficacy,  adverse  events  and  withdrawals  in  this 
subpopulation. 
For  several  antidepressants,  insomnia  and  related  adverse  events  such  as  somnolence,  delayed 
sleep  phase,  and  nocturnal  awakening  are  described  as  common  clinical  problems.  The  incidence  of 
insomnia  and  somnolence  were  similar  to  placebo,  this  in  contrast  to  duloxetine  which  is  associated 
with  insomnia  and  somnolence.  The  updated  MDD  short-term  pool  revealed  insomnia  (somnolence)-
related  TEAEs  for  3.7%  (2.3%)  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  3.9%  (3.0%)  of  Vortioxetine-treated 
subjects. There was no indication of a dose-response relationship in the VORTIOXETINE groups. 
Most antidepressants, including those with a serotonergic effect, are related with sexual dysfunction. 
In  the  clinical  studies,  adverse  events  related  to  sexual  dysfunction  were  evaluated  based  on 
spontaneously  reported  TEAEs  and,  in  6  short-term  studies  (2.5  to  20mg),  also  based  on  the  ASEX. 
The  latter  allowed  identifying  patients  without  sexual  dysfunction  at  baseline  but  who  developed 
treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) during treatment. 
In  the  updated  MDD  short-term  pool,  the  overall  incidence  of  sexual  dysfunction  TEAEs  during 
treatment with VORTIOXETINE was low (1.6%) and similar to that in the placebo group (0.9%). It was 
4.5%  in  the  duloxetine  group  and  12.4%  in  the  venlafaxine  group,  both  are  associated  with  sexual 
dysfunction.  In  the  VORTIOXETINE  dose  groups  (not  updated),  the  incidence  of  sexual  dysfunction 
TEAEs  ranged  from  0%  in  the  1mg  group  to  2.6%  in  the  20mg  group;  however,  there  was  no  dose-
response relationship as the incidences in the 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg groups were 2.3%, 1.6%, 
1.5%,  and  1.3%,  respectively.  Study  14178A  revealed  one  patient  with  2  AEs  related  to  sexual 
dysfunction in the Vortioxetine group and no patient in the agomelatine group. In the MDD long-term 
relapse prevention study, during the open-label period, 2.5% of the patients had a sexual dysfunction 
TEAE.  The  most  common  (>2  patients)  sexual  dysfunction  TEAEs  were  libido  decreased  (1.4%), 
erectile dysfunction (1.7%), and ejaculation delayed (1.2%). During the Double-blind Period, 2.0% of 
the  patients  in  the  VORTIOXETINE  group  and  1.0%  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  sexual  dysfunction 
TEAE. None of the events were reported by >2 patients. 
Looking at treatment emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) based on ASEX scoring for the therapeutic 
dose  range  (5mg  to  20mg),  there  was  no  clear  dose-response  relationship  in  the  incidence  of  TESD 
during treatment with VORTIOXETINE. However, there is an increase in TESD going from the 5 to the 
20 mg group. The overall incidence of TESD during treatment with VORTIOXETINE was 38% which was 
slightly  higher  than  that  in  the  placebo  group  (32%).  In  the  duloxetine  group,  the  incidence of  TESD 
was  48%.  The  incidence  of  TESD  was  43  and  46%  in  the  VORTIOXETINE  15  and  20  mg  groups, 
respectively, and the latter is close to the duloxetine level. There was a tendency for the proportion of 
women  with  TESD  to  be  slightly  larger  than  the  proportion  of  men  with  TESD  for  all  doses  and  in  all 
treatment groups, including placebo. 
Increase  in  TESD  for  the  20  mg  VORTIOXETINE  dose  group  compared  to  placebo  has  been  added  to 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The  incidence  of  extrapyramidal  symptoms  (akathisia  and  dyskinesia)  may  be  adverse  effects  of 
psychotropic 
treatment.  Akathisia 
is  most  of  all  believed 
to  occur  subsequently 
to 
dopaminergic/noradrenergic  neurotransmission.  Vortioxetine  exerts  its  mode  of  action  via  the 
serotonergic system, but with minor influence on other neurotransmitter systems. In the updated MDD 
short-term pool, the incidence of TEAEs captured in the SMQ Akathisia and Dyskinesia were similar in 
the placebo group (0.6% and 0.3%) and in the VORTIOXETINE total group (0.7% and 0.3%).

Vortioxetine  exerts  its  antidepressive  mechanism  solely  by  serotonergic  regulation,  similar  to 
duloxetine,  escitalopram,  fluoxetine,  and  sertraline.  Tardive  dyskinesia  was  not  observed  during  the 
clinical  program.  Furthermore,  tardive  dyskinesia  is  considered  a  long-term  effect  of  antipsychotic 
treatment  e.g.  as  augmentation  to  antidepressants  or  for  treatment-resistant  depression.  Since  this 
scenario does not apply for Vortioxetine, it is not relevant to add tardive dyskinesia to the SmPC. 
Blood pressure and heart rate have been reviewed throughout the VORTIOXETINE clinical development 
programme.  The  vital  signs  evaluations  did  not  show  any  relevant  changes  over  time.  In  addition, 
searches  were  performed  during  the  MDD  short-term  studies  using  the  SMQ  Hypertension.  TEAEs 
(updated  short-term  pool)  were  similar  for  placebo  and  VORTIOXETINE  (1.3%  each)  with  preferred 
terms  of  blood  pressure  increased  and  hypertension  mentioned  most  frequently.  Nevertheless, 
hypertensive crisis was reported in one patient as SAE and in 4 additional patients on Vortioxetine as 
TEAE.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  hypertensive  crisis  under  Vortioxetine 
treatment. 
Hyponatraemia is considered a risk in patients using antidepressants, in particular in the elderly. The 
harmful  effects  of  hyponatraemia  may  be  exacerbated  in  patients  who  take  diuretics  and  other 
medications. (Moret et al., 2009). Clinical safety laboratory values have been reviewed throughout the 
VORTIOXETINE clinical development programme. The serum sodium values did not show any relevant 
changes over time. In addition, searches were performed using the SMQ Hyponatraemia/SIADH. Very 
few  cases  were  reported.  In  MDD  short-term  Study  12541A  in  the  elderly,  the  sodium  test  values 
showed no relevant changes over time in the VORTIOXETINE group compared to the placebo group; no 
patients  in  the  VORTIOXETINE  group  had  a  potentially  clinically  significant  low  post-baseline  serum 
sodium value. 
As platelet aggregation is inhibited by serotonin transporter inhibition, drugs that inhibit the serotonin 
transporter  may  result  in increased  bleeding tendencies.  Clinical  pharmacology  studies  have  been 
conducted to assess the potential of VORTIOXETINE to affect the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and 
aspirin.  No  significant  effects  have  been  observed.  Also,  to  assess  the  potential  effect  of 
VORTIOXETINE  on  bleeding,  blood  samples  for  platelet  count  have  been  taken  throughout  the 
VORTIOXETINE clinical development programme. The mean platelet counts did not show any clinically 
relevant  changes  over  time.  In  the  clinical  studies,  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to 
haemorrhage was not higher for VORTIOXETINE than for placebo (updated MDD short-term pool: 1.3% 
for placebo and 1.4% for total Vortioxetine). 
In the MDD short-term pool TEAEs were captured for the SMQ Severe cutaneous adverse reactions. 
The incidence was similar in the placebo and the VORTIOXETINE groups (0.2% for placebo and 0.1% 
for Vortioxetine). 
There was no increased incidence of osteoporosis seen from the data from the clinical studies. 
However,  published  data  strongly  point  towards  a  serotonergic  effect  on  bone  mineral  density  and 
vortioxetine  also  modifies  serotonergic  signalling.    For  this  reason,  adequate  wording  on  this  class 
effect has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
A  potential  for  peripheral  hypertension,  or  visual  field  effects  or  glaucoma  caused  by  an  increase  in 
intra-ocular pressure, was not seen. 
Abuse potential studies in humans have not been performed, but there was no increased reporting of 
drug  abuse.  TEAEs  were  evaluated  using  the  adverse  event  cluster  search  Abuse  Liability:  In  the 
updated MDD short-term pool, a similar number of patients in the placebo and Vortioxetine group had 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 135/159 
 
  
 
AEs  (4.0%  and  3.7%).  Most  AEs  were  due  to  irritability  (1.5%  and  1.1%)  and  sedation  (0.6%  and 
1.1%). Other pools confirmed these results. 
The  Applicant  investigated  withdrawal  symptoms.  The  DESS  were  low  and  similar  in  nature  as  the 
adverse events observed during the study. These do not indicate a dependence liability. 
The intake of overdose was low and mainly involved the accidental intake of 1 or 2 additional tablets. 
The number of adverse events potentially related to abuse liability was low and similar in all treatment 
groups. 
Therefore,  it  is  agreed  that  a  clinical  abuse  liability  study  is  not  necessary  at  the  moment.  The 
Applicant  will  monitor  the  occurrence  of  drug  discontinuation  symptoms  as  part  of  the  routine 
pharmacovigilance  activities.  The  newly  released  SMQ  for  Drug  Abuse,  Dependence  and  Withdrawal 
(MedDRA 15.0, section 2.22) will be used to identify cases.  
Discontinuation symptoms 
Six short-term studies (5 in MDD and 1 in GAD) and the long-term relapse-prevention studies in MDD 
and GAD were designed to investigate the occurrence of potential discontinuation symptoms following 
abrupt discontinuation of treatment with Vortioxetine. 
In  addition,  update  of  study  CCT-002  included  a  2-week  discontinuation  period  following  abrupt 
discontinuation of placebo or Vortioxetine 5mg, 10mg, or 20mg/day. 
Overall,  there  was  no  evidence  of  clinically  relevant discontinuation  symptoms  that  warranted  a  dose 
tapering  of  Vortioxetine.  Due  to  the  long  plasma  elimination  half-life  of  66  hours  and  the  gradual 
elimination from the central 5-HT transporter, there is a relatively long natural down-taper. 
At this time, discontinuation symptoms are referred to in the SmPC as not relevant for Vortioxetine and 
subsequently, there seems to be no need for gradual dose reduction of the substance.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in the clinical pharmacology studies. 
As of updated cut-off date 31st August 2013, 6 deaths had been reported in the clinical development 
programme, all patients were in the Vortioxetine study groups. Deaths were reported consequently due 
to cancer (2), suicide (1), morphine intoxication (1), and accidents (2). According to the investigator, 
there  was  no  apparent  pattern  in  the  causes  of  death  and  were  not  clearly  related  to  the  study 
medication. 
Unfortunately, the Applicant could not further clarify the circumstances of two death cases suspect of a 
suicidal  background  (morphine  intoxication  and  fall  from  a  balcony)  and  one  completed  suicide. 
However, one could assume from the narratives of these cases that at least the subject who fell from a 
balcony has a suicidal background. 
Other serious adverse events 
In the completed clinical pharmacology studies, 4 of the 1243 subjects exposed to Vortioxetine had 
5 SAEs; 1 subject while exposed to placebo  and 3 of the subjects while exposed to 10mg Vortioxetine: 
abortion  spontaneous,  chest  discomfort  and  dyspnoea  –  at  discontinuation  of  Vortioxetine  treatment, 
traumatic fracture. 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 136/159 
 
 
  
 
In the updated MDD short-term pools, the incidence of SAEs was similar in the placebo group (1.0% 
[19  patients])  and  Vortioxetine  Total  group  (1.1%  [41  patients]);  there  was  no  dose-response 
relationship in the Vortioxetine dose groups. 
The  SAEs  that  occurred  in  ≥2  patients  in  the  Vortioxetine  Total  group  were:  convulsion,  depression, 
suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. 
During  long-term  treatment  with  Vortioxetine,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  3.4%  in  the  double-blind 
Period of MDD relapse-prevention Study 11985A. In the open-label period, no SAE occurred in >1 
patient, except for depression which occurred in 2 patients, the other SAEs occurred in only 1 patient, 
among which accidental overdose, serotonin syndrome and a suicide attempt. 
During the open-label period of the GAD relapse-prevention Study 12473A there were 2 psychiatric 
disorders:  one  depressive  disorder  and  one  panic  attack;  2  renal  and  urinary  disorders;  one  atrial 
fibrillation and one ECG prolonged QT-interval; one cholelithiasis; one appendicitis; one migraine; one 
allergic  rhinitis.  During  the  double-blind  phase  there  was  one  anaphylactic  reaction,  one  patient  with 
major depression, one nasal septal operation. 
The  SAE  incidence  was  3.3%  in  the  MDD  open-label  Long-term  Pool.  As  of  26  October  2012,  the 
incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  MDD  ongoing  open-label  long-term  Pool  was  2.4%.  The  only  SAEs  that 
occurred  in  ≥2  patients  were  breast  cancer  female,  cholelithiasis    and  suicide  attempt  (2  patients 
each).  One  patient  has  acute  cholecystitis  and  one  cholecystitis.  All  other  SAEs  occurred  in  single 
patients only and did not follow a specific pattern. 
During  the MDD ongoing open-label long-term studies (314  and  13267B,  data  cut-off  date  as  of 
26th  October  2012),  28  out  of  1144  patients  (2.4%)  have  been  reported  with  an  SAE.  6  of  these  28 
patients  with  SAEs  (21%)  were  from  the  neoplasm  SOC.  The  Applicant  adequately  summarised  the 
individual  risks  for  these  patients,  which  could  be  clearly  traced  back  for  five  of  these  patients  (prior 
carcinomas or other risks for developing carcinomas). None of these events were classified as related 
to study drug, which can be accepted. 
There was no discernible pattern or trends in the types of events within or between treatment groups. 
Several  SAEs  have  been  investigated  and  discussed  in  the  section  on  adverse  events  of  special 
interest. 
Laboratory findings 
The clinical safety laboratory test results indicate that short- or long-term treatment with Vortioxetine 
is  not  associated  with  clinically  relevant  changes  in  any  of  the  tests  that  were  assessed.  The  mean 
changes  and  the  proportions  of  patients  with  shifts  from  normal  values  at  baseline  to  out-of-range 
values at last assessment or with potentially clinically significant (PCS) values were at placebo level. 
Liver and kidney toxicity 
The  liver  function  test  results  were  further  evaluated  using  additional  outlier  criteria  and  the  results 
showed  no  impact  of  Vortioxetine  on  liver  function  as  compared  to  placebo.  In  addition,  the  adverse 
events were analysed for signals of effects on renal or liver function and no indication of such effects 
were seen. 
Weight and lipid values 
In  general,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  abnormal  lipid  values  was  high.  In  the  MDD  Short-term 
Pool,  the  LDL  cholesterol  value  at  baseline  was  above  the  reference  range  in  nearly  60%  of  the 
patients.  However,  both  during  short-  and  long-term  treatment  with  Vortioxetine,  the  mean  changes 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 137/159 
 
  
 
were  at  placebo  level,  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with  shifts  from  normal  at  baseline  to  a  value 
above the reference range was not higher than that with placebo. 
During  long-term  treatment  in  the  Double-blind  Period  of  the  relapse-prevention  study  in  MDD,  the 
mean  weight  increase  for  Vortioxetine  (0.4kg)  was  also  at  placebo  level  (0.6kg).  These  results  were 
supported by those in the relapse-prevention study in GAD and the open-label, long-term studies. 
QT-interval prolongation 
A  thorough  QT  study  has  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  potential  of  Vortioxetine  to  cause  QTc-
interval  prolongation.  The  administration  of  Vortioxetine  10  or  40mg/day  for  14  days  to  healthy  men 
had no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarisation using the ICH E14 definitions. Although, the 
study shows a clear tendency of the higher dose of Vortioxetine 40 mg/day to increase the QT interval. 
The  upper  bound  of  the  two-sided  90%  CI  around  the  least  squares  (LS)  mean,  time-matched, 
baseline-adjusted difference to placebo for QTcNi, QTcF, QTcB, and QTcFm was <10ms for both doses 
of Vortioxetine at all assessment time points. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the largest time-
matched  baseline-adjusted  LS  means  difference  for  QTcNi  (linear)  to  placebo  at  post-treatment  ECG 
collection times. The maximum mean difference to placebo in QTcNi (linear) was 1.4ms (90% CI: -2.1; 
4.9) for VOR 10mg/day and 4.4ms (90% CI: 0.9; 7.9) for Vortioxetine 40mg/day. The positive control 
moxifloxacin  confirmed  the  sensitivity  of  the  study.  No  correlations  between  the  time-matched, 
baseline-adjusted  QTc  and  the  plasma  concentrations  of  Vortioxetine  or  its  metabolites  Lu  AA34443 
and  Lu  AA39835  were  observed.  In  the  categorical  analysis  of  ECG  outlier  events,  the  occurrence  of 
QTcNi (Linear) values >450 ms was observed in one patient receiving Vortioxetine 10 mg/day at day 
14,  5hr  postdose.  No  subject  experienced  QTcNi  (Linear)  >480  and  500  ms  or  change  from  Baseline 
>60  ms.  Few  patients  in  the  Vortioxetine  group  showed  an  increase  in  QTcNi  interval  from  baseline 
>30ms. 
ECGs  have  been  reviewed  throughout  the  clinical  development  programme.  In  the  MDD  short-term 
pool,  the  incidence  of  PCS  high  RR  interval  values  was  1.2%  in  the  placebo group  and  ranged  in  the 
therapeutic Vortioxetine dose groups from 1.1% in the 15mg group to 2.6% (25 patients) in the 5mg 
group. The incidence of PCS low PR interval values in the placebo group was 2.1% and ranged in the 
therapeutic Vortioxetine dose groups from 2.7% in the 10mg group to 4.6% in the 15mg group. 
In  the  MDD  relapse-prevention  study,  during  the  double-blind  period,  the  incidences  of  PCS  ECG 
parameter  values  were  low.  PCS  ECG  parameter  values  with  an  incidence  ≥2%  in  either  treatment 
group were: 
• low PR interval (placebo group: 4.3%; Vortioxetine group: 3.0%) 
• high QTcB (placebo group: 1.1%; Vortioxetine group: 2.0%) 
• high RR interval (placebo group: 3.2%; Vortioxetine group: 1.5%) 
In the ongoing open-label long-term safety pool, at the cut-off of 26 October 2012, the ECG parameter 
values with an incidence of PCS values ≥2% were high RR interval (2.4%) and low PR interval (3.9%). 
Searches were performed using the SMQ Torsade de Pointes/QT Prolongation. 
In the MDD short-term pool, the majority of the events captured in this SMQ were ECG QT prolonged. 
All the events were non-serious and none of them were reported as arrhythmias or torsade de pointes. 
No  events  in  the  placebo  or  Vortioxetine  dose  groups  resulted  in  withdrawal  from  the  study.  One 
patient in the Vortioxetine 10 mg group had syncope; one patient in the Vortioxetine 2.5mg group had 
loss of consciousness (severe event; concurrent with an accident). In the MDD & GAD Short-term Pool, 
MDD  long-term  relapse-prevention  Study  11985A,  and  the  MDD  Open-label  Long-term  Pool,  the 
incidences and pattern of TEAEs in the SMQ Torsade de Pointes/QT Prolongation were similar to those 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 138/159 
 
 
  
 
in the MDD Short-term Pool. A total of 5 patients had syncope: 3 patients who received Vortioxetine 
2.5mg/day in short-term studies in GAD and 2 patients during long-term treatment with Vortioxetine; 
1  event  was  mild,  3  events  were  moderate,  and  1  event  was  severe;  1  patient  withdrew  due  to 
syncope  and  9  other  events.  In  addition,  3  patients  withdrew  from  open-label  treatment  with 
Vortioxetine  due  to  electrocardiogram  qt  prolonged.  In  GAD  long-term  relapse-prevention  Study 
12473A,  1  patient  had  ventricular  tachycardia  on  Day  5  of  the  Open-label  Period,  was  withdrawn 
from  the  study,  and  recovered  from  the  event;  the  patient  had  a  history  of  obesity,  ventricular 
extrasystoles, and hypertension and received beta blockers and angiotensin II antagonists. In addition, 
1 patient had an SAE of electrocardiogram qt prolonged and electrocardiogram T wave inversion 
(non-serious) reported in the Open-label Period; the patient completed the study. In the Double-blind 
Period, 1 patient in the Vortioxetine group had electrocardiogram qt prolonged. 
In  the  clinical  studies,  the  incidences  of  potentially  prolactin-related  TEAEs  were  at  the  placebo  level 
during short- and long-term treatment with Vortioxetine. The data do not suggest that treatment with 
Vortioxetine is associated with an increase in serum prolactin. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex 
Pharmacokinetic assessment with respect to sex revealed exposure increases of up to 30% in women. 
In  the  MDD  short-term  pool,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  was  similar  between  men 
and  women  in  the  Vortioxetine  5mg  group.  In  the  Vortioxetine  10mg,  15mg,  and  20mg  groups,  the 
incidences  of  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  was  higher  for  women  (6.5%,  9.5%,  and  9.3%, 
respectively)  than  for  men  (4.5%,  5.2%,  and  6.3%,  respectively).  In  the  MDD  Short-term  Pool,  the 
incidences of TEAEs were similar between men and women, except for nausea, which was consistently 
lower in men than in women in the therapeutic Vortioxetine dose groups, the active reference groups, 
and  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  nausea  increased  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  in  both  men 
(from 17% in the 5mg group to 22% in the 20mg group) and women (from 23% in the 5mg group to 
35% in the 20 mg group). 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  and  more  specifically  of  nausea  is  higher  in  women  than  in  men,  which  is 
referred  to  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  The  pharmacokinetically  observed  slightly  higher  exposure  in 
women than in men possibly contributes to this effect. 
Age 
Age-related  differences  were  found  in  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  subjects  aged  ≥65  years  having 
approximately 30% higher exposure to Vortioxetine compared to subjects aged 45 years and younger 
after treatment with multiple doses of 10 mg/d.  
In  the  dedicated  study  in  the  elderly  ≥65  years  of  age  (Study  12541A),  treatment  with 
VORTIOXETINE  5mg/day  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  and  the  safety  profile  was  not  different 
from  that  in  patients  aged  <65  years.  For  VORTIOXETINE,  the  changes  in  the  clinical  safety 
laboratory results, vital signs, weight, or ECGs were at placebo level. In the updated MDD short-term 
studies (including the study in the elderly), in which approximately 9% of the patients were aged ≥65 
years,  there  was  no  consistent  trend  in  the  safety  profile  between  patients  aged  <  or  ≥65  years.  
When looking at the therapeutic VORTIOXETINE doses, patients aged <65 years had a higher incidence 
of  TEAEs  in  the  VORTIOXETINE    5  mg  and  10  mg  group  compared  to  patients  aged  ≥  65  years.  In 
contrast,  more  patients  aged  ≥  65  years  had  TEAEs  in  the  higher  dose  groups  of  VORTIOXETINE  15 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 139/159 
 
 
  
 
and 20 mg. In the VORTIOXETINE 20mg group, the incidences of nausea and constipation were 
higher in patients aged ≥65 years (42% and 15%, respectively); than in patients aged <65 years 
(27% and 4%, respectively). These are issues of tolerability rather than safety. Of note, patients aged 
≥  65  years  had  a  nearly  twofold  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  from  study  (5.1%, 
14.7%, 14.3%, and 15.2% for Vortioxetine 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg) compared to patients <65 
years of age (4%, 4.6%, 7.4%, and 6.4% for Vortioxetine 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg). 
In  the  new  Study  14178A  (Vortioxetine  versus  agomelatine),  19  patients  with  an  age  ≥  65  were  on 
VORTIOXETINE  treatment.  More  elderly  patients  had  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to withdrawal  than  in  the 
whole study population (5.3% vs 1.2% and 15.8% vs 5.9%, respectively). However, this population is 
too small to draw conclusions. 
The MDD open-label long-term pool and the ongoing open-label long-term pool do not indicate 
a  difference  in  the  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  between  patients  >  65  and 
≤65. The number of patients included for the 15mg/day and 20 mg/day doses are limited. 
Table presents the incidences of the TEAEs by age group for Vortioxetine (5 to 20mg/day) and placebo 
in the MDD Short-term Pool. 
Table  16:  Summary  of  TEAEs,  entire  study  period,  by  treatment  and  age  group  (APTS)  – 
MDD short-term pool 
A PASS is planned to also cover elderly patients above 75 years of age. An update regarding the MDD 
short-term  pool  was  presented  including  newly  generated  data  on  patients  65  years  and  above  (see 
Panel 27).

The  short-term  safety  in  the  elderly  has  been  investigated  in  study  12541A,  using  5  mg/day  of 
VORTIOXETINE while the currently recommended dosage in the SmPC is 10 mg once daily. 
PK data indicate an increased exposure in the elderly aged ≥65 years (approximately 30%) compared 
to subjects aged 45 years and younger after treatment with multiple doses of 10 mg/d. On this basis, 
no dose adjustment in elderly is required, although a higher number of AEs can be expected. 
A dose of 5mg/day was shown to be safe and well tolerated in the elderly population. 
Data from the MDD short term pool indicate that the 10 mg/day dose does not lead to larger amount 
of TEAEs, but to a higher number of study withdrawals due to TEAEs. In the MDD open-label long-term 
pool (5 and 10 mg/day), the incidence of nausea was slightly higher in patients aged <65 years than in 
patients aged ≥65 years (18% and 11%, respectively). 
For the 15 mg/day dose, the number of patients is too small to draw clear conclusions (n=21 for short 
term and n=14 for long term). In the MDD short-term pool, the incidences of TEAEs and TEAEs leading 
to withdrawal were increased. For the 20 mg/day dose, the long term data are also limited (n=25). In 
the  updated  MDD  short-term  pool  an  increase  in  TEAEs,  especially  nausea  and  constipation  was 
observed, as well as an increase in TEAEs leading to withdrawal. The incidence of nausea increased in 
the  20  mg/day  group  from  27%  in  patients  below  65  years  to  42  %  in  patients  ≥  65.  In  the  MDD 
ongoing long-term pool (15 and 20 mg/day) data are too scarce to draw conclusions. 
The use of doses above 10mg/day in the elderly population shows limitations regarding the number of 
patients studied with these doses. At this moment no major safety concerns in the elderly population 
have  been  observed,  however  due  to  the  limited  data  in  the  elderly  population  for  doses  above  10 
mg/day, the increased exposure in elderly and an increase in TEAEs and TEAEs leading to withdrawal

for the 15 and 20 mg/day dose in the short term pool, a dose increase should be undertaken only with 
particular caution, as reflected in the SmPC. 
Few  elderly  patients  were  treated  with  the  higher  doses  during  the  long–term  studies.  There  are 
generally  more  adverse  effects  in  patients  >65  years  of  age,  e.g.  those  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation.  
BMI 
In  the  MDD  Short-term  Pool,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal,  the  overall  incidence  of 
TEAEs,  and  the  types  of  TEAEs  with  an  incidence  ≥5%  in  the  VORTIOXETINE  groups  were  generally 
similar among the different BMI categories. 
Genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes 
A phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis, indicated that CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers have an 
approximately  2-fold  higher  oral  clearance  than  poor  metabolisers  (PMs).  Therefore,  an  analysis  of 
tolerability  in  CYP2D6  PMs  versus  CYP2D6  non-PMs  from  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  was 
conducted. 
Of  the  41  PMs,  20,  15,  and  7  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  VORTIOXETINE  ≤10mg,  15  to 
30mg,  and  ≥40mg,  respectively.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  in  these  dose  categories  was  10.6, 
7.4, and 6.5 days, respectively. Of the 879 non-PMs, 518, 242, and 162 subjects received at least one 
dose of VORTIOXETINE ≤10mg, 15 to 30mg, and ≥40mg, respectively. The mean duration of exposure 
in these dose categories was 9.3, 5.3, and 8.5 days, respectively. 
The incidences of TEAEs leading to withdrawal were 4.9% (2 subjects) and 2.4% (21 subjects) in the 
PM group and the non-PM group, respectively. The TEAEs leading to withdrawal in the PM group were 
vomiting  and  angioedema.  In  the  non-PM  group,  the  most  common  TEAE  leading  to  withdrawal  was 
vomiting (4 subjects); all other TEAEs leading to withdrawal did not occur in  >2 subjects. The  TEAEs 
with an incidence ≥5% in both groups were: nausea, diarrhoea, headache, and dizziness.  
Nausea, dizziness, pruritus and pruritus generalised were higher in the PM group than in the non-PMs. 
An approximately two-fold increase in VORTIOXETINE exposure was seen following coadministration of 
bupropion  (a  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitor).  When  bupropion  was  added  to  VORTIOXETINE  10mg/day  at 
steady  state,  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  observed  than  when  VORTIOXETINE    was 
added  to  bupropion  at  steady  state.  This  may  be  explained  by  pharmacodynamic  or  combined 
pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic effects following CYP2D6 inhibition with bupropion, which seem to 
be more pronounced when the inhibition is initiated when VORTIOXETINE is in steady state than before 
VORTIOXETINE  is  administered.  Depending  on  the  individual  patient  response,  a  lower  dose  of 
VORTIOXETINE  may  be  considered  if  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  are  added  to  VORTIOXETINE  
treatment. 
The  frequency  of  some  adverse  effects  is  doubled  in  the  PM  group,  like  for  dizziness  and  pruritus. 
Probably,  the  dose  will  also  have  an  influence.  Therefore,  this  additional  aspect  should  be  taken  into 
account in this analysis of PMs versus non-PMs. However, analysis based on grouping by genotype of 
patients in the phase II/III studies is not possible as no genotyping was performed. Blood sampling for 
plasma  concentrations  of  Vortioxetine  was  performed  in  patients  from  Studies  11492A,  11984A, 
12541A, 13267A, 305, 315, and 316, which allows for a pooling of adverse events by average plasma 
concentration (Cav). 10% of patients with the highest Cav were a substitute for low clearance and the 
10% of patients with the lowest Cav for high clearance.

Only  in  the  20  mg  VORTIOXETINE  group,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  higher  in  the  low-
clearance group than in the normal-clearance group. Globally, the overall incidence of adverse events 
was similar in patients categorised as having low or normal clearance. 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC has been updated to specify: CYP2D6 poor metabolisers: As for all patients, 
depending  on  individual  patient  response,  a  dose  adjustment  may  be  considered.  In  section  4.2, 
highlights that “depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 
20 mg daily or decreased to a minimum of 5 mg daily”. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Patients  with  hepatic  and  renal  insufficiency  have  been  excluded  from  the  phase  II/III  studies.  We 
refer  to  study  114  and  112,  investigating  the  effect  of  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of VORTIOXETINE. 
Pregnant and lactating women 
A  total  of  36  women  who  received  VORTIOXETINE  became  pregnant  during  or  shortly  after  stopping 
treatment  with  VORTIOXETINE.  For  the  majority  of  these  pregnancies,  the  mother  had  an  elective 
abortion or gave birth to a healthy infant with no birth or developmental birth defects.  
Some of these outcomes are still unknown; however, the data presented do not give raise to a specific 
concern and are therefore acceptable. 
In  lactating  rats,  VORTIOXETINE-related  material  was  distributed  to  the  milk.  It  is  expected  that 
VORTIOXETINE will be excreted into human milk. 
Overdose 
In  Study  10272,  single  ascending  doses of VORTIOXETINE  10,  20,  30,  50,  or  75mg  were  explored  in 
36 healthy young men. There was a slightly higher proportion of TEAEs in the two highest dose groups, 
with more frequent GI disorders, in which nausea had the highest incidence, the other AE in this SOC 
were diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Also dizziness was more frequently observed in the highest dose 
groups. 
In  Study  10467,  multiple  ascending  doses  of  VORTIOXETINE  20,  40,  or  60mg/day  for  12  days  were 
explored  in  18  healthy  young  men.  The  most  common  TEAEs  reported  by  subjects  receiving 
VORTIOXETINE  were  diarrhoea  (33-67%  vs.  11%  for  placebo),  abdominal  discomfort  (33-67%  vs. 
22% for placebo), headache (33-50% vs. 44% for placebo) and procedural site reactions (33-50% vs. 
33% for placebo). The subject incidence of headache and procedural site reaction were similar in all of 
the  treatment  groups  (VORTIOXETINE  and  placebo).  Diarrhoea,  abdominal  discomfort  and 
abdominal  pain  were  more  common  in  subjects  receiving  VORTIOXETINE  compared  with  those 
receiving placebo. For diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort the incidence was generally higher at the 
highest dose (60 mg). It is of note that 13 of the 18 men receiving active treatment had abdominal 
discomfort,  abdominal  pain  or  diarrhoea  during  the  first  3  days  of  dosing.  In  most  subjects  these 
adverse events were transient and had resolved by Day 4. Generalised pruritus was reported for 3 
out of 6 patients for 60 mg and not for the other doses. 
In addition, 6 healthy young women received single doses of 60mg followed by washout and 12 days 
of exposure to VORTIOXETINE 40mg/day. The single dose of 60 mg VORTIOXETINE  (Day 1) was not 
well tolerated by the young women; therefore the dose was reduced to 40 mg for multiple dosing on 
Days 5 to 16. The most common TEAEs in subjects receiving VORTIOXETINE were nausea (83-100% 
vs. 0% for placebo), flushing (33-100% vs. 0% for placebo), dizziness postural (67-33% vs. 33% 
for  placebo),  headache  (83-33%  vs.  0%  for  placebo),  abdominal  discomfort  (33-67%  vs.  0%  for 
placebo),  dizziness  (50-33%  vs.  0%  for  placebo),  somnolence  (67-0%  vs.  0%  for  placebo), 
diarrhoea (0-67% vs. 0% for placebo) and pruritus generalised (17-50% vs. 0% for placebo).

Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
In driving performance Study 12689A, single and multiple doses of VORTIOXETINE 10mg/day did not 
impair  driving  performance  compared  to  placebo  as  assessed  using  the  standard  deviation  of  lateral 
position and standard deviation of speed during an on-the-road driving test. 
Based  on  a  pharmacodynamic  test  battery  assessing  psychomotor  and  cognitive  effects, 
VORTIOXETINE  10mg/day  administered  in  the  evening  yielded  no  residual  effects,  whereas 
mirtazapine yielded moderate residual effects in the acute phase. 
In  the  MDD  Short-term  Pool,  the  incidences  of  insomnia,  somnolence,  fatigue,  and  sedation  in  the 
VORTIOXETINE  Total  group  were  similar  to  those  in  the  placebo  group.  However,  the  incidence  of 
dizziness increased slightly with increasing dose. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Potential  drug-drug  interactions  were  investigated  in  11  pharmacology  studies.  The  majority  (8 
studies)  were  cytochrome  P450  interaction  studies  (bupropion,  rifampicin,  ketoconazole/fluconazole, 
omeprazole,  cocktail  [caffeine,  tolbutamide,  dextromethorphan,  and  midazolam],  combined  oral 
contrazeptive  [ethinyl  estradiol  and  levonorgestrel],  warfarin,  diazepam).  There  were  3  other 
interaction studies with ethanol, aspirin and lithium. 
Significantly  higher  incidences  of  AEs  were  observed  when  bupropion  150  mg  BID  was  added  to  the 
VORTIOXETINE  10  mg  QD  monotherapy  (related  AE  from  60  to  89%).  No  corresponding  increase  in 
the  incidence  of  AEs  was  observed  when  VORTIOXETINE  10  mg  QD  was  added  to the  bupropion  150 
mg  BID  monotherapy.  AEs  with  the  greatest  incidence  were  nausea  (60%  and  30%  respectively), 
headache (43 and 47%), vomiting (33 and 23%), insomnia (33 and 7%), palpitations (20 and 13%), 
hyperhidrosis (20 and 10%), constipation (23 and 0%), dizziness (23 and 13%), postural dizziness (23 
and 13%), dyspepsia (13 and 10%) and tremor (13 and 10%). 
According  to  the  results  from  bupropion  interaction  Study  117,  CYP  2D6  plays  a  major  role  in 
metabolism of Vortioxetine and CYP 2D6 inhibitors like bupropion increase exposure to Vortioxetine  (in 
terms of AUC) with concomitantly increased rates in adverse events, e.g. vomiting, nausea, insomnia, 
dizziness.  Patients  concomitantly  treated  with  other  strong  CYP  2D6  inhibitors,  e.g.  paroxetine,  and 
fluoxetine, are also considered at increased risk for adverse events.  
The Applicant stated correctly that strong antidepressant inhibitors were not allowed during the clinical 
studies. A search was conducted including strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors others than antidepressants and a 
total of six patients were found with strong inhibitors, mainly with terbinafine. No new adverse events 
were reported which could lead to the assumption of an altered safety profile of Vortioxetine. However, 
since  data  on  concomitant  administration  with  other  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  like  fluoxetine  and 
paroxetine  are  lacking,  no  final  conclusion  can  be  drawn  at  this  time.  The  Applicant  included  further 
potent  CYP2D6  inhibitors  to  SmPC  section  4.2  in  regard  to  dose  reduction  while  on  combination 
therapy with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. 
Study  115  evaluated  the  potential  interaction  of  Vortioxetine  and  rifampicin  (a  broad  inducer  of  CYP 
isoforms): Co-administration of Vortioxetine  20 mg and rifampicin 600 mg following multiple doses of 
rifampicin 600 mg, led to a 72% reduction in AUC(0-tlqc), a 77% reduction in AUC(0-inf), and a 51% 
reduction  in  the  Cmax  of  Vortioxetine.  The  majority  of  adverse  events  were  associated  with  the 
administration of rifampicin 600 mg QD alone on Days 15 to 24.

There  were  no  significant  exposure  changes  and  increases  in  adverse  events  throughout  the  other 
interaction studies. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
If  an  adverse  event  was  contributory  to  withdrawal,  the  adverse  event  was  regarded  as  the  primary 
reason for withdrawal. 
In  the  updated  MDD  Short-term  Pool,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs) 
leading to withdrawal was higher in the VORTIOXETINE therapeutic dose groups (5 to 20mg/day) and 
in  the  duloxetine  group  (8.8%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (3.6%);  in  the  VORTIOXETINE  therapeutic 
groups, the incidence increased with dose from 4.1% in the 5 mg group to 7.8% in the 15 mg group. 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  in  the  20  mg  Vortioxetine  group  was  lower 
(6.8%). The updated MDD short-term pool showed up to be similar to the original data. 
During long-term treatment with VORTIOXETINE in the Double-blind Period in MDD relapse prevention 
Study, the incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal was 6.9% in the VORTIOXETINE group and 1.0% 
in the placebo group. In the open-label extension studies, the incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal 
during long-term treatment with 2.5 to 10mg/day was 6.2% (MDD Open-label Long-term Pool) and the 
incidence during long-term treatment with 15 or 20mg/day (MDD Ongoing Long-term Pool) was 10%. 
Nausea was the most common TEAE leading to withdrawal in each of the active treatment groups and 
more frequently compared to the placebo group. For VORTIOXETINE, the incidence of nausea leading 
to withdrawal increased with dose and, for the therapeutic doses, it ranged from 1.1% at 5mg/day to 
3.8% at 15mg/day. Nausea as an AE leading to withdrawal was reported in 3.3% of subjects from the 
20mg  Vortioxetine  dosing  group.  The  majority  of  the  patients  who  withdrew  due  to  nausea  did  so 
within the first 3 weeks of treatment. No other pattern was seen in the TEAEs leading to withdrawal. 
-The withdrawal due to adverse events in the double-blind period of the GAD relapse prevention study 
is  lower  than  in  the  MDD  relapse  prevention  study.  No  apparent  explanation  was  found  on  this 
difference in withdrawal due to AEs.  
- Several adverse events are related to the disorder itself, like depression, suicidal ideation, depressive 
symptom,  major  depression,  insomnia,  depressed mood,  suicide  attempt  and  are  related  to  a  lack  of 
efficacy.  However,  only  very  few  patients  withdrew  due  to  depression-related  TEAEs  (as  primary  or 
contributory reason).  
Discontinuations  from  study  treatment  due  to  adverse  events  were  slightly  higher  for  Vortioxetine 
compared to placebo in all pools using placebo controls giving an overall consistent picture. The most 
common adverse event leading to withdrawal was nausea. The risk for this event leading to treatment 
discontinuation was highest during the first weeks of treatment.  
The  incidences  of  nausea  with  5  mg  and  10  mg  Vortioxetine  (21%  and  23%)  are  similar  and  also 
withdrawal  due  to  nausea  (1.1%  and  1.4%)  regarding  the  updated  MDD  short-term  pool.  This  is 
substantiated by the fact that a similar number of patients on 5 mg and 10 mg Vortioxetine withdrew 
within the first week of treatment (1% and 0.9%; original MDD short-term pool data). Based on these 
data, titration of Vortioxetine is not considered beneficial in the adult population.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Population exposure 
The integrated safety database for Vortioxetine  refers to 18 completed clinical phase II/III studies in 
adult subjects with MDD and 5 completed phase III studies in subjects with GAD. Studies were pooled 
either to the MDD short-term pool, the GAD short-term pool, the MDD and GAD short-term pool, the 
MDD open-label long-term pool or the MDD ongoing open-label long-term pool. Individual studies were 
not  pooled  and  results  were  presented  separately  for  MDD  relapse-prevention  study,  GAD  relapse 
prevention study, several MDD short-term studies, which are ongoing, and one MDD open-label long-
term  study  (OCT-001),  which  is  also  ongoing.  At  day  180,  data  have  been  added  from  a  recently 
completed  double-blind  12-week  active-comparator  study  with  flexible  doses  of  10  to  20  mg/day 
(study  14178A)  and  studies  317,  14122A,  and  CCT-002.  An  update  was  also  presented  for  the  MDD 
ongoing open-label long-term studies 13267B and 314. 
The  Extent  of  Population  Exposure  to  Assess  Clinical  Safety  (ICH  CPMP/ICH/375/95)  is  adequate.  In 
the  MDD-GAD  short  term  pool,  1466  patients  received  5  mg/day,  853  10mg,  298  15mg  and  455 
20mg.  As  of  the  new  data  cut-off  date  August  2013,  an  additional  144  (497,  151,  and  357)  patients 
contributed  to  the  overall  short-term  safety  of  Vortioxetine  5mg  (10mg,  15mg,  and  20mg).  ICH  E1 
guidance  requests  data  from  300  to  600  patients  treated  for  6  months  at  dosage  levels  intended  for 
clinical use, which has been adequately presented by the Applicant: 528 patients received 5 mg, 861 
patients  received 10  mg, 258  patients  received 15 mg  and  524  patients  received  20  mg Vortioxetine 
up to 26th of October 2012. About 100 patients should receive the drug at dosage levels intended for 
clinical use for more at least one year. This has been adequately fulfilled for each dose level (e.g. 124 
patients with 15 mg and 270 patients with 20 mg Vortioxetine). 
Currently,  data  on  the  elderly  population  is  limited.  The  Applicant  committed  to  perform  a  drug 
utilisation  study  which  will  provide  further  information  on  safety  in  elderly  patients  >75. 
Hyponatraemia  is  considered  a  field  of  interest  in  the  elderly,  especially  in  those  treated  with 
antidepressants,.  
Patient disposition 
Patient disposition revealed an overall consistent picture for the short-term pools with withdrawal rates 
of  16-23%  for  doses  of  5  to  20  mg/day  and  for  the  MDD  long-term  pools  with  discontinuations 
between  37  and  46%.  A  slightly  higher  number  (46%)  of  subjects  withdrew  from  the  ongoing  open-
label  long-term  pool.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  treatment  were  adverse 
events and lack of efficacy. In the ongoing MDD open-label long-term pool, withdrawal of consent was 
the  most  common  reason  for  withdrawal  (11%).  Fewer  patients  on  Vortioxetine    withdrew  from  the 
short-term  pools  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  (1.9%)  compared  to  long-term  open-label  pools  (5  to  6%). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events during vortioxetine treatment varied less in all pools (5 to11%).

TEAEs 
The system organ classes (SOC) with the highest proportion of patients with AEs were Gastrointestinal 
disorders and Nervous System disorders. Within these SOCs, most AEs were rated mild to moderate in 
severity.  
The most frequent adverse event is nausea (up to 31% with no clear dose-relationship). Headache (up 
to 20%) and dizziness (< 10%) were most often mentioned within the nervous system disorder SOC. A 
relationship to dose could not be established with these events.  
The incidences of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation were slightly higher for Vortioxetine 
than  for  placebo  and  slightly  higher  at  15  and  20mg/day  than  at  5  and  10mg/day.  Among  the  less 
frequent  TEAEs,  abnormal  dreams,  decreased  appetite,  pruritus  generalised,  and  influenza  had  an 
incidence ≥2% and at least twice that for placebo at one or more of the Vortioxetine therapeutic doses. 
With  respect  to  TEAEs  included  in  section  4.8  of the  SmPC,  the  causal  relationship  of  adverse  events 
attributed  to  Vortioxetine  was  determined  by  a  dose-response  relationship  or  an  incidence  of  ≥  1.5-
times compared to placebo.  
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
At this time, there seems to be no increased risk for suicidality under Vortioxetine treatment compared 
to  other  antidepressants  with  a  similar  mode  of  action.  Nevertheless,  further  investigation  is  needed 
also  because  suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal  behaviour  is  a  class  effect  known  for  antidepressants.  The 
PASS study, will specifically evaluate completed suicides and suicide attempts. 
SAEs 
The  occurrence  of  serious  adverse  events  under  Vortioxetine  treatment  was  in  the  same  range 
compared  to  placebo  in  the  short-term  studies  (around  1%).  Within  each  pool,  no  accumulation  of 
SAEs  of  specific  preferred terms  could  be  seen.  Nevertheless,  single  SAEs  recurring  over  all  analysed 
pools were spontaneous abortion, depression, suicidal ideation/attempt/completed suicide. Of note and 
special interest, 21% of SAEs in the ongoing open-label long-term pool with 15 and 20 mg Vortioxetine 
were  from  the  neoplasm  SOC,  which  is  considered  a  high  number.  For  5  of  these  6  patients  prior 
carcinomas or other risks for developing carcinomas were identified. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Convulsions, serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome remain a potential risk. 
Patients  with  a  history  of  mania  or  hypomania  were  excluded  from  studies,  therefore  the  possible 
switch  from  depression  to  mania  as  a  result  of  Vortioxetine  treatment  has  not  been  investigated.  . 
Vortioxetine    should  be  used  with  caution  in  this  population  and  should  be  discontinued  in  patients 
entering a manic phase.  
The incidence of insomnia and somnolence were similar to placebo, this in contrast to duloxetine which 
is associated with insomnia and somnolence. 
In  the  updated  MDD  short-term  pool,  the  overall  incidence  of  sexual  dysfunction  TEAEs  during 
treatment with Vortioxetine was low (1.6%) and similar to that in the placebo group (0.9%). Looking 
at  treatment  emergent  sexual  dysfunction  (TESD)  based  on  ASEX  scoring  for  the  therapeutic  dose 
range (5mg to 20mg), there was no clear dose-response relationship in the incidence of TESD during 
treatment  with  Vortioxetine.  However,  there  is  an  increase  in  TESD  going  from  the  5  to  the  20  mg 
group.  The  overall  incidence  of  TESD  during  treatment  with  Vortioxetine  was 38%  which  was  slightly 
higher than that in the placebo group (32%). In the duloxetine group, the incidence of TESD was 48%. 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 147/159 
 
  
 
The incidence of TESD was 43 and 46% in the Vortioxetine 15 and 20 mg groups, respectively, which 
is close to the duloxetine level. The latter is associated with sexual dysfunction. 
No significant effects have been observed for extrapyramidal symptoms, hypertension, hyponatraemia, 
increased  bleeding  tendencies,  severe  cutaneous  reactions,  osteoporosis  or  glaucoma.  The  risk  for 
bone  fractures  (osteoporosis)  in  SSRIs  and  TCAs  is  a  known  class  effect  and  has  been  added  to  the 
SmPC (see CMDh/PhVWP/020/2010). 
Abuse potential 
The  Applicant  investigated  withdrawal  symptoms.  The  DESS  were  low  and  similar  in  nature  as  the 
adverse events observed during the study. These do not indicate a dependence liability. The intake of 
overdose was low and mainly involved the accidental intake of 1 or 2 additional tablets. The number of 
adverse events potentially related to abuse liability was low and similar in all treatment groups. 
Therefore,  a  clinical  abuse  liability  study  is  not  necessary  at  the  moment.  The  Applicant  will  monitor 
the  occurrence  of  drug  discontinuation  symptoms  as  part  of  the  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities. 
The  newly  released  SMQ  for  Drug  Abuse,  Dependence  and  Withdrawal  (MedDRA  15.0,  section  2.22) 
will be used to identify cases. 
Discontinuation symptoms 
Some patients may experience discontinuation symptoms with Vortioxetine, particularly if treatment is 
stopped  abruptly.  Discontinuation  symptoms  were  assessed  by  looking  at  the  TEAEs  emerging  after 
Week 1 and Week 2 following stop of treatment. Results were inconsistent in the single clinical studies 
neither indicating an absence of discontinuation symptoms nor a marked effect of Vortioxetine on the 
emergence of discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation symptoms were also assessed in three MDD 
short-term  studies  using  the  discontinuation-emergent  signs  and  symptoms  checklist  (DESS).  The 
overall  DESS  scores  in  the  Vortioxetine    groups  were  slightly  higher  compared  to  placebo  after 
Discontinuation Week 1 and 2. DESS single items were similar to the discontinuation TEAEs (incidence 
of 10% and more: irritability, fatigue/tiredness, trouble sleeping/insomnia and increased dreaming and 
nightmares). 
At  this  time,  discontinuation  symptoms  are  not  considered  to  be  of  significant  concern  and  a  gradual 
dose reduction of the substance is not supported by data. 
Laboratory findings 
The effects of Vortioxetine  on laboratory results of haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis did 
not  raise  any  clinically  relevant  concerns.  Clinically  relevant  abnormalities  in  hepatic  analytes  have 
been  rarely  detected  for  AST  and  ALT  and  were  not  different  from  placebo.  Therefore,  no  safety 
concern is raised on the alteration of liver function. 
In  general,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  abnormal  lipid  values  was  high.  In  the  MDD  Short-term 
Pool,  the  LDL  cholesterol  value  at  baseline  was  above  the  reference  range  in  nearly  60%  of  the 
patients.  However,  both  during  short-  and  long-term  treatment  with  Vortioxetine,  the  mean  changes 
were  at  placebo  level,  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with  shifts  from  normal  at  baseline  to  a  value 
above the reference range was not higher than that with placebo. 
The vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the controlled short- and long-term studies did 
not  raise  any  tolerability  or  safety  concerns  and  did  not  indicate  that  treatment  with  Vortioxetine  is 
associated  with  changes  therein.  In  the  thorough  QT  Study,  the  administration  of  Vortioxetine  10  or 
40mg/day for 14 days to healthy men had no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarisation using 
the ICH E14 definitions. Although, the study shows a clear tendency of the higher dose of Vortioxetine 
40 mg/day to increase the QT interval. Furthermore, the adverse events did not raise any signals of QT 
prolongation or arrhythmias. Tachycardia was reported to occur at a higher incidence in Vortioxetine-
Brintellix

Page 148/159 
 
  
 
treated subjects compared to placebo (3.5% for Vortioxetine 10 mg and 2.4% for Vortioxetine 40 mg 
vs. 1.2% in placebo-treated subjects). These results were confirmed in the phase II/III clinical studies. 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetic assessment with respect to sex revealed exposure increases of up to 30% in women. 
The incidence of TEAEs and more specifically of nausea is higher in women than in men. 
The  short-term  safety  in  the  elderly  has  been  investigated  and  proven  in  study  12541A,  using  5 
mg/day of Vortioxetine. 
PK data indicate an increased exposure in the elderly aged ≥65 years (approximately 30%) compared 
to subjects aged 45 years and younger after treatment with multiple doses of 10 mg/d. On this basis, 
no dose adjustment in elderly is required, although a higher number of AEs can be expected. 
Data from the MDD short term pool indicate that the 10 mg/day dose does not lead to larger amount 
of TEAEs, but to a higher number of study withdrawals due to TEAEs. In the MDD open-label long-term 
pool (5 and 10 mg/day), the incidence of nausea was slightly higher in patients aged <65 years than in 
patients aged ≥65 years (18% and 11%, respectively). 
For the 15 mg/day dose, the number of patients is too small to draw clear conclusions (n=28 for short- 
term and n=14 for long-term). In the MDD short-term pool, the incidences of TEAEs and TEAEs leading 
to withdrawal were increased. For the 20 mg/day dose the long term data are limited (n=25). In the 
MDD short-term pool an increase in TEAEs, especially nausea and  constipation was observed, as  well 
as  an  increase  in  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal.  The  incidence  of  nausea  increased  in  the  20  mg/day 
group from 27% in patients below 65 years to 42 % in patients ≥ 65. In the MDD ongoing long-term 
pool (15 and 20 mg/day) data are scarce. 
The  use  of  doses  above  10mg/day  in  the  elderly  population  has  limitations  regarding  the  number  of 
patients  studied  with  these  dosesand  therefore,  particular  caution  should  be  exercised  when  using 
doses above 10 mg/day. 
From  an  interaction  point  of  view,  Vortioxetine  was  shown  to  undergo  CYP  isoenzyme 
biotransformation  via  CYP2D6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP3A,  and  CYP2A6.  Of  these,  CYP2D6  plays  a 
major  role  in  Vortioxetine  metabolism.  The  frequency  of  some  adverse  events  doubles  in  the  poor 
metabolizer  (PM)  group,  but  few  patients  were  included  in  the  PM  group.  The  increased  exposure  in 
CYP2D6 PM can be managed by dose reduction if tolerability issues arise.  
An analysis based on grouping by genotype of patients in the phase II/III studies is not possible as no 
genotyping  was  performed.  Instead,  a  pooling  of  adverse  events  by  average  plasma  concentration 
(Cav)  was  performed.  10%  of  patients  with  the  highest  Cav  were  a  substitute  for  low  clearance  and 
the  10%  of  patients  with  the  lowest  Cav  for  high  clearance.  In  the  20  mg  Vortioxetine    group,  the 
incidence of adverse events was higher in the low-clearance group than in the normal-clearance group. 
Globally,  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  similar in  patients  categorised  as  having  low  or 
normal clearance. 
Bupropion is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor and led to increased Vortioxetine  exposure and subsequently 
AE  reporting  when  concomitantly  treated.  Patients  concomitantly  treated  with  other  strong  CYP2D6 
inhibitors, e.g. paroxetine, and fluoxetine, are also considered at increased risk for adverse events and 
a dose reduction of vortioxetine should be considered.  
Current  data  presented  do  not  give  rise  to  a  specific  concern  on  pregnancies.  However,  exposure  to 
serotonergic  medicinal  products  during  the  third  trimester  has  been  associated  with  medication 
withdrawal symptoms in the newborn and with an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 149/159 
 
  
 
in the newborn, which is a serious condition with a mortality rate of about 10%. These potential risks 
have been highlighted in the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Treatment  with  Vortioxetine    at  therapeutic  doses  (5  to  20  mg/day)  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  in 
adults. The incidence of nausea, the most common adverse event, was shown to be higher at doses of 
15 and 20 mg/day compared to doses of 5 and 10 mg/day and typically had an onset within the first 
week  of  treatment  and  on  average  had  a  duration  of  1  to  2  weeks.  Nausea  was  the  most  common 
adverse  event  leading  to  withdrawal  and  more  so  with  the  higher  doses.  Other  common  adverse 
events  were  headache,  dry  mouth,  dizziness,  and  diarrhoea.  In  the  long-term  pools,  the  incidence of 
TEAEs in Vortioxetine-treated patients confirms the safety profile obtained in the short-term pools. 
The use of doses >10mg/day in the elderly population, especially in patients 75 years of age and older, 
shows limitations regarding the number of patients studied with these doses and the SmPC  has been 
adapted to reflect this issue. ).  
At this time, there seems to be no increased risk for suicidality under Vortioxetine treatment compared 
to  other  antidepressants  with  a  similar  mode  of  action.  Nevertheless,  further  investigation  will  be 
conducted  as  part of  the PASS  study.  Suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal  behaviour  is  a  class  effect  known 
for antidepressants. 
Vortioxetine  seems to underlie variable pharmacokinetics and various parameters affect the systemic 
exposure (e.g. gender, age, race, CYP2D6 status, and drug-drug interactions). 
A  non-interventional  post-authorisation  safety  study  (PASS)  of  vortioxetine  in  Europe  will  be  carried 
out to collect information on important missing information (off-label use regarding indication, off-label 
paediatric use, use in pregnant women, use in patients aged ≥75 years, use in patients with a history 
of  mania/hypomania,  use  in  patients  with  Alzheimer’s  disease,  Parkinson’s  disease,  multiple  sclerosis 
and  stroke,  use  in  patients  with  severe  renal  or  hepatic  impairment,  misuse  for  illegal  purposes  like 
abuse/dependance)  as  well  as  to  describe  patterns  of  use  of  vortioxetine  in  clinical  practice  and  to 
further  characterize  important  potential  risks  (suicidal  ideation  and  behavior;  convulsions/seizures, 
severe renal or hepatic disorders due to precipitation of metabolites in kidney and liver). ) 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 3.0, the PRAC considers by consensus 
that  the  risk  management  system  for  Vortioxetine  (Brintellix)  for  the  treatment  of  major  depressive 
episodes  in  adults  is  acceptable.  The  following  points  should  be  taken  into  account  in  the  next  Risk 
Management Plan update: 
1.  The  assessment  of  dependence  (drug  abuse)  should  be  included  in  the  scope  of  the  planned 
PASS; 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 150/159 
 
  
 
2.  Information on the safety and tolerability of the 15 and 20 mg/day dose of vortioxetine on the 
long term in patients > 65 years of age should be captured; 
3.  The quality of the analysis of adverse events reports should be enhanced. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

Pharmacovigilance plans 
The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
The  PRAC  also  considered  that  the  proposed  drug  utilisation  study  is  sufficient  to  monitor  the 
effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice but recommended that the PASS also captures withdrawals due to lack 
of  efficacy  for  the  different  dosages,  with  the  aim  to  collect  additional  information  in  the  elderly  as 
shown below.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects  
Twelve  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  6/8-week,  fixed-dose  studies  have  been  conducted  to 
investigate the short-term efficacy of vortioxetine in MDD in adults (including the elderly). The efficacy 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 154/159 
 
 
  
 
of vortioxetine was demonstrated with at least one dosage group across 9 of the 12 studies, showing 
at  least  a  2-point  difference  to  placebo  in  the  Montgomery  and  Åsberg  Depression  Rating  Scale 
(MADRS) or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24-item (HAM-D24) total score. 
Treatment  with  vortioxetine  for  6  or  8  weeks  at  doses  of  5,  10  or  20  mg  had  moderate  effect  on 
depression  in  patients  suffering  from  MDD  included  in  the  clinical  development  programme.  These 
doses  were  found  to  be  superior  compared  to  placebo  as  demonstrated  by  a  significant  reduction  of 
baseline MADRS or HAM-D24 total score after 6 or 8 weeks of treatment and the clinical relevance of 
the effect was supported by the proportions of responders and remitters and the improvement in the 
CGI-I score. 
In  the  meta-analyses,  the  average  effect  size  of  the  MADRS  versus  placebo  ranged  between  -2.6 
points (p=0.008) for the lowest therapeutic dose (5mg/day) and -4.6 points (p <0.001) for the highest 
therapeutic dose (20 mg/day). The average effect size was -4.1 points (p <0.001) for the 10 mg/day 
doses.  The  15  mg/day  dose  did  not  separate  from  placebo  in  the  meta-analysis,  but  the  mean 
difference to placebo was -3.5 points. Therefore, a dose-dependent effect has been reasonably shown. 
The  addition  of  the  placebo-controlled  studies  317,  14122  A  and  CCT-002  that  were  completed  after 
MAA  submission  did  not  change  the  conclusions  with  respect  to  dose.  In  the  meta-analysis  including 
these  studies  the  overall  mean  difference  to  placebo  across  the  studies  remained  statistically 
significant: -2.3 points (p = 0.007), -3.6 points (p <0.001), and -4.6 points (p <0.001) for the 5, 10, 
and  20  mg/day  doses,  respectively;  again,  the  15mg/day  dose  did  not  separate  from  placebo  in  the 
meta-analysis, but the mean difference to placebo was -2.6 points. 
Whilst  the  inclusion  of  the  above  mentioned  3  additional  short-term  studies  in  the  the  meta-analysis 
initially  only  including  the  8  short-term  studies  generally  resulted  in  lower  effect  sizes  in  the  primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints, results are still in favour of vortioxetine, as supported by the pooled 
responder analysis.   
The  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  10  or  20  mg/day  was  further  demonstrated  in  a  12-week,  double-blind, 
flexible-dose  comparative  study  versus  agomelatine  25  or  50  mg/day  in  patients  with  MDD. 
Vortioxetine  was statistically significantly better than agomelatine as measured by improvement in the 
MADRS total score. Clinical relevance of the effect was supported by the proportions of responders and 
remitters and improvement in the CGI-I scores. 
In one relapse prevention study, the risk to relapse was two times higher for placebo-treated patients 
than for vortioxetine-treated patients, and there was a statistically superior effect of vortioxetine 5 and 
10 mg/day relative to placebo on the time to relapse of MDD. 
In addition, maintained efficacy of vortioxetine was also supported by four open-label extension studies 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects  
A dose range from 5 to 20 mg/day with a starting dose of 10mg/day is considered to be justified for 
patients  <  65  years,  however  since  data  are  limited  in  patients  ≥  65  years  for  doses  higher  than 
10mg/day  particular  caution  should  be  exercised,  and  the  starting  dose  should  be  5  mg/day  in  the 
elderly. 
Concerning  depression  history,  relatively  slight  imbalances  between  treatment  arms  were  reported 
across studies for the median number of previous episodes and duration of the current episode. Since 
there  is  no  indication  that  randomization  and  allocation  concealment  were  compromised  during  the 
conduct of the studies, these imbalances most likely reflect a random process.  
The  mechanism  of  action  of  vortioxetine  in  patients  is  not  totally  clarified.  The  claimed  multimodal 
effects of vortioxetine acting at several receptor targets and at the 5-HTT is considered responsible for 
Brintellix 
EMA/699150/2013 
Page 155/159 
 
  
 
the antidepressant effect. However overall, a convincing independent effect on cognition and function 
(HrQoL) (beyond antidepressant effect)remains to be shown. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The  types  of  AEs  were  generally  comparable  to  those  seen  for  the  antidepressant  duloxetine.  Up  to 
one-third of all patients reported nausea as most common adverse event under Vortioxetine treatment 
being of highest occurrence during the first weeks of treatment. The incidence of nausea was shown to 
be  higher  at  doses  of  15  and  20  mg/day  compared  to  doses  of  5  and  10  mg/day.  However,  similar 
numbers were seen in the comparator groups venlafaxine and duloxetine. There seems to be a slight 
reduction in nausea during long-term treatment with Vortioxetine. For the TEAEs dizziness, diarrhoea, 
and vomiting, the incidences in the Vortioxetine groups were higher compared to placebo. The severe / 
discontinuation  due  to  AEs  were  predominantly  in  the  gastrointestinal  disorder  (GI),  nervous  system 
disorder,  and  psychiatric  disorder  organ  class  (SOC).  Serious  AEs  recurring  over  all  analysed  pools 
were spontaneous abortion, depression, suicidal ideation/attempt/completed suicide. 
Suicidality has been comprehensively addressed in the dossier as requested by the Draft Guideline on 
Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Depression (EMA/CHMP/185423/2010, 
Rev 2). Suicidal events have not been reported for the clinical pharmacology studies neither in terms 
of  TEAEs  nor  in  terms  of  validated  rating  scales.  Exposure-related  differences  do  not  indicate  an 
increased risk for suicidality under Vortioxetine treatment compared to placebo and duloxetine (0.1% 
vs. 0% each in the controlled MDD short-term pool) and at this time, there seems to be no increased 
risk for suicidality under Vortioxetine treatment compared to other antidepressants with a similar mode 
of action. Nevertheless, the proposed PASS study will further caractherise this potential risk. A warning 
on suicidality is placed in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Convulsions, serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are referred to as potential risk. 
Vortioxetine  seems to be benign in terms of EPS effects, QT prolongation, renal and hepatic toxicity, 
body  weight.  Sexual  dysfunction  was  similar  to  placebo  and  lower  compared  to  venlafaxine  with  no 
negative  effect  on  long-term  treatment.  However,  looking  at  treatment  emergent  sexual  dysfunction 
(TESD) based on ASEX scoring, there is an increase in TESD going from the 5 to the 20 mg group. The 
incidence  of  TESD  was  43  and  46%  in  the  Vortioxetine  15  and  20  mg  groups,  respectively,  and  the 
latter is close to the duloxetine level, which is associated with sexual dysfunction. 
In the elderly study, treatment with Vortioxetine 5mg/day was safe and well tolerated and the safety 
profile  was  not  different  from  that  in  patients  aged  <65  years.  In  the  pooled  studies,  in  the 
Vortioxetine  20 mg group, the incidences of nausea and constipation were higher in patients aged ≥65 
years  (42%  and  15%,  respectively);  than  in  patients  aged  <65  years  (27%  and  4%,  respectively). 
These are tolerability rather than safety issues. The TEAEs led more often to withdrawal from the study 
in the elderly (≥65 years). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The short-term safety data in the elderly has been mainly investigated using 5 mg/day of Vortioxetine. 
Less  data  was  provided  with  doses  of  10  to  20  mg/day.  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  and  rate  of 
discontinuation due to adverse events during the short-term experience was slightly higher compared 
to younger subjects for higher doses of 10 to 20 mg/d. A very low number of patients > 75 years have

been  included  in  the  clinical  studies.  These  patients  may  be  additionally  affected  by  hyponatraemia 
while receiving co- medication (e.g. diuretics).  
Patients with a history of mania or hypomania were excluded from the studies; therefore the possible 
switch  from  depression  to  mania  as  a  result  of  Vortioxetine  treatment  has  not  been  investigated.  A 
PASS will provide further information on the use, efficacy, adverse events and withdrawals in patients 
with (a history of) mania/hypomania. 
Vortioxetine    treatment  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour, 
based  on  the  TEAEs  and  C-SSRS,  although  patients  with  a  significant  risk  of  suicide  were  excluded 
from the Vortioxetine clinical development programme. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Short  and  long-term  efficacy  of  vortioxetine  for  the  treatment  of  major  depressive  episodes  in  adult 
patients has been established. From a safety point of view, the types of adverse events reported were 
similar to those already known from other serotonin-accented antidepressants.  
Remaining uncertainties will be addressed in a non-interventional PASS study, covering the important 
potential risks of suicidal ideation/behaviour, convulsions/seizures, severe renal and hepatic disorders 
as  well  as  important  missing  safety  information,  which  pertains  to  off-label  use  (indication),  off-label 
use  in  paediatrics,  use  in  pregnant  women,  use  in  patients  aged  ≥75  years,  use  in  patients  with  a 
history  of  mania/hypomania,  use  in  patients  with  Alzheimer`s  disease,  Parkinson`s  disease,  MS  and 
stroke,  and  use  in  patients  with  sever  renal  or  hepatic  impairment.    Additional  information  on  the 
safety  and  tolerability  (including  withdrawal  rate  due  to  AEs)  of  the  15  and  20  mg/day  dose  of 
vortioxetine on  the long-term  in  patients 65  years and  older  will  also  be  captured  within  the  RMP.  In 
addition, data on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy/loss of efficacy will be collected. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall Benefit /Risk of Brintellix is positive for the 5 to 20 mg/day dose range in adults aged <65 
years of age. Caution is advised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses higher than 10 mg 
vortioxetine for which data are limited. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
This new medicine provides an additional alternative for the treatment of patients with MDD. Efficacy 
of Vortioxetine  versus placebo was demonstrated in 9 (7 positive and 2 supportive) of the 12 short-
term studies and in the long-term treatment of MDD in adults and the elderly. About one-third of the 
studies  were  either  failed  or  negative  in  the  primary  analysis.  However,  negative  studies  are  not 
uncommon in MD due to the lack of sensitivity. 
Efficacy was shown on the broad spectrum of depressive symptoms and in patients with severe MDD. 
The  clinical  relevance  was  supported  by  the  proportions  of  responders  and  remitters  and  the 
improvement in  the  CGI-I  score.  However,  specific  effects  due  to  the  postulated  new  mechanism  of 
action  on  cognition  and  function  have  not  yet  been  convincingly  demonstrated  and  remain  to  be 
shown.

Uncertainties  pertaining  to  long-term  efficacy  data  of  the  higher  doses  and  dose  range  in  the  elderly 
are addressed with appropriate warnings in the SmPC. 
Uncertainties  including  the  largely  unexplained  lower  response  in  the  US  remain  although  efficacy  in 
the treatment of MDD is considered to be proven. 
The  safety  profile  of  vortioxetine  was  shown  to  be  comparable  to  other  serotonin-accented 
antidepressants.  Unfavourable  effects  are  mainly  those  pertaining  to  tolerability  issues  like  GI 
disorders,  especially  nausea,  and  to  nervous  system  disorders,  especially  headache  and  most 
commonly reported adverse events are rather mild in nature. Suicidality remains a potential important 
risk in line with other antidepressants that will be further addressed by means of the PASS study and 
referred to as a class warning in the SmPC. 
The elderly are considered an important part of the treated population. The evaluation of vortioxetine 
in the very old population (>75) is limited but will be covered by the PASS. In addition, the Applicant 
committed  to  capture  information  on  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  15  and  20  mg/day  dose  of 
vortioxetine during  short- and  long-term  treatment in  patients  ≥ 75  years of age  within  the  scope  of 
the RMP. 
To  conclude,  the  overall  benefit  risk  profile  of  Vortioxetine    in  the  treatment  of  major  depressive 
episodes is considered positive.

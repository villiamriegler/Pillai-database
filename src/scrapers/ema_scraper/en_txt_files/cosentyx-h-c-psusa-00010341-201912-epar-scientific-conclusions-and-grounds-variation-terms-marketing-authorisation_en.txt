Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for secukinumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on fatigue, nausea and headache from clinical trials and spontaneous reports 
including cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC 
considers a causal relationship between secukinumab and these adverse reactions is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing secukinumab should 
be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for secukinumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing secukinumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

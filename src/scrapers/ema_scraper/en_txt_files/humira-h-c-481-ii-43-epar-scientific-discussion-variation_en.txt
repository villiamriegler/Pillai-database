Introduction 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody containing human 
peptide  sequences  that  binds  to  human  Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF)  alpha  and  neutralises  the 
biological  function  of  TNFα  by  blocking  its  interaction  with  the  p55  and  p75  cell  surface  TNFα 
receptors. 
Adalimumab  is  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  psoriatic  arthritis 
(PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn’s disease (CD) and psoriasis (PsO).  
The  initial  PsA  indication  was  approved  in  2005  through  variation  II.22  (Commission  decision  of 
1 August  2005).  To  support  the  initial  application  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH) 
submitted  two  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  clinical  studies  (M02-518  and  M02-570)  and  an  interim 
report of the open-label long-term extension study (M02-537).   
In  the  present  variation  application,  the  MAH  applied  for  an  extension  of  the  PsA  indication  for 
adalimumab to include reduction of the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and 
improvement of physical function. 
To  support  the  joint  damage  claim  the  MAH  submitted  X-ray  data,  from  the  previously  submitted 
study M02-518 and the long-term extension study M02-537.  The claim of improved physical function 
was based on data from studies M02-518 and M02-570. With the submission of the final clinical study 
report (CSR) for Study M02-537, the MAH also fulfilled the outstanding follow up measure (FUM) 
No 25.  
PsA  is  a  chronic,  inflammatory,  usually  rheumatoid  factor  (RF)-negative  arthritis  associated  with 
psoriasis. According to European  (EU) guidance for treating PsA, psoriasis is prevalent in 1% to 3% 
of  the  population.  Estimates  of  those  psoriasis  patients  who  develop  PsA  vary  widely  (6%-42%). 
Affecting men and women equally, PsA typically appears between the ages of 30 and 50 years. PsA 
usually  involves  multiple  peripheral  joints,  the  axial  skeleton,  sacroiliac  joints,  fingernails,  and 
entheses.  The  presentation  of  PsA  has  been  categorized  into  5  overlapping  clinical  patterns,  which 
include  oligoarthritis,  polyarthritis,  arthritis  of  distal  interphalangeal  (DIP)  joints,  spondylitis,  and 
arthritis mutilans. More than one-half of the patients with PsA may have evidence of erosions on X-
rays, and up to 40% of the patients may develop severe, erosive arthropathy. 
PsA has some similar symptoms to RA, including joint pain and destruction and fatigue. PsA can be 
distinguished from RA by one or more factors (e.g. presence of psoriasis; seronegative for RF (> 80% 
of  patients);  patterns  of  joint  involvement  including  asymmetry,  distal  interphalangeal  disease,  and 
spinal  disease;  dactylitis;  enthesitis),  but  overall  PsA  and  RA  are  closely  related  diseases.  Most 
treatments used are similar. 
The MAH proposed to amend the text of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) sections 4.1, 
and 5.1, and to update the package leaflet (PL) accordingly. Minor changes were proposed to sections 
4.2 and 4.8.  
Clinical aspects1 
Clinical efficacy 
Main studies 
Adalimumab was studied in two controlled clinical studies (M02-518 and M02-570) in subjects with 
active  PsA.  Both  were  double-blind  studies  with  a  1:1  randomisation  of  adalimumab  40  mg  every 
other  week  (eow)  versus  placebo.  Subjects  who  completed  Study  M02-570  (12  weeks  duration)  or 
1  A  summary  of  the  details  of  the  studies  referred  in  this  section  is  presented  in  the  Clinical  efficacy  section.  This  report 
addresses the data submitted for the proposed change to the indication and other product information wording changes. For

M02-518 (24 weeks duration) and who met the inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in M02-
537, a multicentre, open-label long-term extension study.  
Study  M02-518  was  24  weeks  in  duration.  It  was  required  that  subjects  had  inadequate  non  steroid 
anti-inflammatory  drug  (NSAID)  response  and  subjects  were  stratified  by  methotrexate  (MTX)  use 
and extent of Ps (> 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) at baseline. There were 313 subjects 
included.  
Study M02-570 was 12 weeks in duration and included 100 subjects. It was required that subjects had 
inadequate response to DMARD therapy, and subjects were stratified by DMARD use at baseline.  
Study  M02-537  was  conducted  to  study  the  long-term  safety,  efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetic  (PK), 
including  immunogenicity,  of  repeated  administration  of  40  mg  adalimumab  eow  (or  40  mg 
adalimumab weekly for subjects who met criteria for dose escalation). Subjects were treated for up to 
120 weeks or until adalimumab was commercially available for PsA in the subject's study participation 
country  (whichever  was  later).  Beginning  at  week  12,  subjects  who  failed  to  respond  (defined  as 
failure to demonstrate ≤ 20% decrease from baseline in both swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint 
count; TJC) were allowed to increase their dose of adalimumab to 40 mg weekly. 
Methods 
Subject Population 
In studies M02-518 and M02-570, the main inclusion criteria were similar but with some differences, 
as described below: 
•  Diagnosis  of  PsA  and  with  moderate  to  severe  activity  defined  by  ≥3  swollen  joints  and 
≥3 tender or painful joints. 
Inadequate response/intolerant to NSAIDs (study 518). 
•  Concurrent/history of inadequate response to DMARD (study 570). 
• 
•  Corticosteroid dose ≤10 mg/day and stable since 4 weeks, was allowed. 
•  Allowed  to  be  on  MTX  since  minimum  3  months  and  stable  ≤30  mg/week  since  4 weeks 
(study 570). 
•  Allowed to be on MTX/DMARD (except cyclosporine/tacrolimus) and as above (study 518). 
•  Presence of active/documented history of cutaneous chronique plaque psoriasis lesions. 
Exclusion criteria included general contraindications for anti-TNF therapy and previous treatment with 
other anti-TNF/biologics. 
For inclusion in M02-537, the subject should have completed Study M02-518 or M02-570. 
Efficacy Variables 
In Studies M02-570 and M02-518, the primary efficacy variable was ACR202 response at week 12. An 
additional  primary  efficacy  variable  in  Study  M02  −  518  was  the  inhibition  of  disease  progression 
assessed by modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) on X-rays of the hands and feet at week 24. mTSS 
ranged from 0 - 570 and included the JSN score (48 sites [0 - 4 for each site] for a range of 0 - 192) 
plus the erosion score (54 sites [0 - 7 for each site] for a range of 0 - 378). A lower score indicated a 
better result. An increase was defined as a change of > 0.5 of mTSS. The primary X-ray endpoint; the 
comparison of change in mTSS of adalimumab treated subjects at week 48 with the change in mTSS 
of  placebo  treated  subjects  at  week  24;  was  defined  upon  consultation  with  the  FDA.  Since  all 
placebo-treated  subjects  switched  to  open-label  adalimumab  at  the  week  24  Visit,  no  comparison  to 
placebo could be made at week 48. 
Several  additional  endpoints  were  evaluated,  such  as  the  HAQ−DI  (disability  index  of  the  health 
assessment  questionnaire),  SF-36  PCS  and  MCS  (the  36  question  short-form  health  survey  physical 
and  mental  component  summaries),  ACR50/70,  PsARC  (psoriatic  arthritis  response  criteria),  and 
2 The ACR response criteria were developed for RA. The ACR20 criteria is defined as a ≥20% reduction in the tender joint 
count, a ≥20% reduction in the swollen joint count and a ≥20% reduction in 3 of 5 additional measures: a) patient assessment 
of pain, b) patient global assessment of disease activity, c) physician global assessment of disease activity, d) disability index 
of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and, e) acute phase reactant.

FACIT  (functional  assessment  of  chronic  illness  therapy)  Fatigue  Scale.  In  subjects  with  psoriasis 
involvement  at  enrolment  the  PGA  (physician's  global  assessment  for  psoriasis),  and  DLQI 
(dermatology life quality index) were also assessed. 
M02-537 full analysis set 
The  full  analysis  set  was  the  primary  analysis  population  for  baseline  and  long-term  efficacy 
parameters  (with  the  exception  of  X-ray  endpoints,  see  below)  and  consisted  of  all  subjects  who 
received at least one adalimumab injection in Study M02-518, M02-570, or M02-537. The M02-537 
full  analysis  set  consisted  of  395  subjects:  382  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  adalimumab 
injection in Study M02-537 and 13 subjects who received adalimumab in Study M02-570 or M02-518 
but did not enter M02-537. 
X-ray analysis sets  
Only data from subjects in Study M02-518 were used for analyses of X-rays. Baseline X-ray data were 
defined  as  an  X-ray  performed  <56  days  after  the  first  study  drug  injection  in  M02-518.  In  study 
M02-537, X-rays were analysed at weeks 24, 72, and 120. Two analysis sets were used.  
M02-537  week  48  X-ray  analysis  set:  The  week  48  X-ray  analysis  set  included  subjects  who  had 
baseline and week 24 X-ray data with > 50% assessments made, and received at least one injection of 
adalimumab in Study M02-537. This data set included 133 subjects on adalimumab and 141 subjects 
on placebo in Study M02-518.  
M02-537 week 144 X-ray analysis set: The M02 537 week 144 X-ray analysis set included all subjects 
in the week 48 X-ray analysis set, who had a value at week 48 and a X-ray at week 96 or week 144 
with > 50% assessments read for all time points. For subjects with a missing mTSS at week 144, the 
mTSS at week 96 was used. This dataset included 115 subjects on adalimumab and 128 subjects on 
placebo in Study M02-518. 
Subgroup  analyses  for  mTSS  were  performed  for  a  number  of  subgroups,  including  symmetric 
polyarthritis. 
Baseline disease characteristics  
The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  PsA  subjects  were  representative  of  patients  with 
moderately to severely active PsA.  Demographic  and baseline characteristics for the M02-537 week 
48  X-ray  analysis  set  and  M02-537  week  144  X-ray  analysis  set  showed  no  meaningful  differences 
from the characteristics of the M02-537 full analysis set (N = 395). A summary of the baseline mTSS 
for the M02-537 week 48 X-ray analysis set is presented in Table 1 below.

Statistical Methods 
The statistical methods in general were considered acceptable. 
The primary analysis of the mTSS was the comparison of the change from baseline to week 48 in the 
adalimumab group and the change from baseline to week 24 in the placebo group. This analysis was a 
superiority test. The primary analysis was performed on the M02−537 week 48 X-ray analysis set. 
Results 
X-ray analyses  
Adalimumab-treated subjects had statistically significantly less progression in mTSS from baseline to 
week  48  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects  from  baseline  to  week  24  (0.0  vs.  0.8,  p<0.001)  as 
shown in the Table 2 below (results are shown in bold, underlined).

In subjects treated with placebo, 29% had an increase in mTSS from baseline to week 24 compared to 
10%  of  adalimumab-treated  subjects.  For  subjects  originally  randomised  to  receive  adalimumab  in 
Study M02-518, 12% had an increase in mTSS from baseline to week 48.  
The changes from baseline in both the erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores demonstrated 
that  adalimumab-treated  subjects  had  statistically  significantly  less  progression  in  Sharp  Score 
components from baseline to week 48 compared to placebo-treated subjects from baseline to week 24 
(p=0.002 for JSN, p<0.001 for erosion).  
Long-term efficacy 
Subjects with no progression from baseline to week 48 were evaluated at week 144 to determine the 
proportion of subjects that continued to show no progression as defined by a decrease or no change in 
mTSS. Of the 102 subjects that showed no progression through week 48, a total of 86 (84.3%) subjects 
continued to show no progression from week 48 to week 144. In Table 3 below, a summary of mean 
changes in mTSS up to week 144 is shown for subjects with and without progression from baseline to 
week  24.  Table  4  shows  the  number  of  subjects  who  progressed,  or  did  not  progress  during  the 
complete study period.

Subjects received adalimumab 40 mg eow starting at week 24. 
For subjects who do not have a week 144 mTSS, the week 96 mTSS was used. 
Subgroups analyses 
The MAH undertook a number of subgroup analyses for the mTSS endpoint, including age, race, sex, 
body  weight,  site,  duration  of  PsA  quartiles,  various  baseline  parameters  (e.g.  MTX  use,  RF,  CRP 
HAQ − DI, TJC, SJC, mTSS, ACR20 responses at various time points and in subjects with symmetric 
polyarthritis  and  for  subjects  who  completed  Study  M02-537).  In  general,  all  subgroups  showed 
similar  clinical  effects  following  treatment  with  adalimumab,  including  the  subjects  with  symmetric 
polyarthritis.  
Physical function  
The MAH basis the claim of ‘improved physical function’ on analyses in study M02-518 of changes 
from baseline to week 12 and week 24 of various patient reported outcomes, such HAQ-DI and SF-36. 
These  two  were  proposed  to  be  included  into  the  SPC,  and  are  therefore  described  in  further  detail 
below.  Maintenance  of  improvement  of  physical  function  was  analysed  in  the  open  label  extension 
study  M02-537.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  24  weeks  data  had  been  assessed  previously,  with  the 
consequent  update  of  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  with  the  following  statement:  “Humira  treated  patients 
demonstrated improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey 
(SF 36), from base-line to week 24.” 
Results from Study M02-518 
There was a statistically significant difference in mean change in HAQ-DI as well as for SF-36 PCS in 
adalimumab-treated  subjects  in  Study  M02-518  compared  to  placebo  at  both  weeks  12  and  24.  At 
week 24, changes in HAQ-DI scores from baseline were of -0.1 ± 0.42 for placebo and -0.4 ± 0.49 for 
Page 7 of 14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adalimumab,  and  for  SF36  PCS  1.5  ±  9.72  for placebo  and  9.3  ±  10.03  for  adalimumab.  For  SF-36 
MCS no statistically significant difference between treatment groups was seen at either time point. 
For the mean change in HAQ-DI, a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.30 between 
adalimumab  and  placebo  was  seen  at  weeks  12  and  24.  For  PsA,  a  MCID  for  SF-36  was  not 
established, but a general MCID of 3 to 5 points was determined, and was achieved for the SF-36-PCS 
component at weeks 12 and 24.  
Open Label extension  
From  week  4  and  onwards,  up  to  week  144,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI  was 
-0.4 + 0.45/0.50, among the subjects who remained in the study (week 12 n=142; week 144 n=108). 
At week 12, 51% achieved a MCID of 0.30, and at week 144, 52% achieved this result.  
For  SF-36,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI  ranged  from  9.2  +  9.97  (week  24)  to 
12.2 + 9.91  (week  48),  among  the  subjects  who  remained  in  the  study  (week  12  n=136;  week  144 
n=102).  
ACR  response:  The  MAH  proposed  to  update  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  to  reflect  that  ACR  responses 
were maintained in the open-label extension study for up to 136 weeks. Table 5 shows a summary of 
the ACR 20/50 and 70 results during the open label extension study M02-537.

A  proportion  of  patients  had  an  ACR  20  response  at  week  136;  namely  99  of  133  subjects  who 
remained in the study week 136, or 99 of the 363 patients who were in the study at the 12 week time 
point. These figures point to the drop out rate in the trial. Additionally, measures of physical function 
and quality of life remained improved in a proportion of subjects during the open label study period.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH applied to change the existing PsA indication to add that adalimumab has been shown to 
reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Data  on  physical  function  were  assessed  previously  in  variation  II.22,  and  this  was  reflected  in  the 
SPC,  section  5.1.  The  data  showed  that  treatment  with  adalimumab  resulted  in  improved  physical 
function,  measured  by  various  patient  reported  outcomes,  including  HAQ-DI  and  the  physical 
component of SF-36. Overall, these data support a revision of the indication as applied for, to align the 
indication for Humira with that of other anti-TNF agents.   
The joint damage claim is based on newly submitted X-ray data from study M02-518 and the long-
term  extension  study  M02-537.  The  effect  of  adalimumab  on  progression  of  joint  damage  was 
assessed using the mTSS, which was considered as an acceptable parameter for assessment of X-ray 
data, but which is difficult to apply in a general clinical setting. The definition of an increase of the 
score (> 0.5 change) was agreed. The primary X-ray analysis was undertaken by comparing 24 weeks 
placebo results with 48 weeks results for adalimumab. This analysis was agreed with given the nature 
of the endpoint; i.e. progression of joint damage. It was shown that adalimumab-treated subjects had 
statistically  significantly  less  progression  in  mTSS  from  baseline  to  week  48  compared  to  placebo-
treated subjects from baseline to week 24 (0.0 vs. 0.8, p<0.001). 
The  magnitude  of  the  natural  progression  during  the  study  period  was  considered  as  one  important 
factor  when  assessing  whether  the  active  treatment  reduces  the  progression  of  joint  damage.  There 
were 24 weeks placebo data available from approximately 144 subjects. Although the placebo period 
was short for the assessment of progression of joint damage, 29% of patients showed an increase of 
the mTSS (i.e., change of mTSS > 0.5). The CHMP therefore concluded that the population in the trial 
was  relevant  for  studying  effects  on  structural  damage.  In  the  adalimumab  group,  10  -12  %  had  an 
increased  mTSS  at  weeks  24  and  48,  respectively.  These  data  support  that  adalimumab  reduces  the 
rate of progression of joint damage measured by X-ray, even if the evaluation period was short. 
However, maintenance of reduced progression of joint damage was considered difficult to assess, due 
to the short placebo controlled period (24 weeks) and poor knowledge about the natural progression 
rate in PsA. The open label study results showed that rather few subjects on adalimumab progressed at 
all during the 144 weeks treatment period; 21 % had in increased mTSS from baseline to week 144. 
This  is  less  than  the  number  of  placebo  subjects  who  had  an  increased  mTSS  during  the  24  weeks 
placebo period (29%). Although these data support a reduced progression rate following adalimumab 
treatment  during  at  least  a  2  years  period,  the  magnitude  of  effect  is  difficult  to  assess,  since  it  is 
unknown  whether  there  is  a  linear  joint  damage  progression  rate;  i.e.  if  the  placebo  patients  would 
have continued with the same rate during a longer period. It was also unknown how many additional 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group  who  would  have progressed  during  a  2 years  period.  Furthermore,  the 
CHMP considered that it is unclear if this effect is relevant for all subtypes of PsA. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  support  can  be  gained  from  RA,  where  more  knowledge  about  joint 
damage  progression  is  available.  Symmetric  PsA  shows  greatest  resemblance  with  RA.  Experience 
from  other  anti-TNF  agents  supports  an  effect  in  subjects  with  symmetrical  disease,  while  relevant 
effects in subjects with asymmetrical disease have been less convincing.  
The  MAH  undertook  subgroup  analyses,  in  subjects  with  symmetric  polyarthritis,  which  support  an 
effect in this subgroup. The CHMP considered that, given the support from RA, other anti-TNF-agents 
and  the  subgroup  analyses  submitted  by  the  MAH,  an  indication  of  treatment  of  subjects  with 
polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease could be agreed.

Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  adalimumab  was  determined  through  evaluation  of  AEs  (adverse  events),  clinical 
laboratory  evaluations,  physical  examinations,  and  vital  signs.  In  addition,  TNF  −  inhibitor  related 
AEs of interest were evaluated: infections, serious infections, malignancies, opportunistic infections, 
tuberculosis  (TB),  demyelinating  disorders,  lupus  −  like  syndrome,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF), 
allergic reactions, injection site reactions, haematologic events, and hepatic events.   
Patient exposure 
All subjects who received at least one adalimumab injection in Study M02-570, M02-518, or M02-537 
were included in the M02-537 safety analysis set. For analyses of laboratory parameters and vital sign 
parameters,  subjects  who  were  missing  an  evaluation  were  excluded  from  the  analysis  of  that 
particular  parameter/visit.  There  were  395  subjects  who  had  received  adalimumab.  The  mean 
treatment  duration  was  808  ±  286  days  (+  SD);  the  median  (range)  was  875  (15-1290)  days.  There 
were 342 (87%) who had > 60 weeks treatment, 318 (81%) who had > 104 weeks treatment and 84 
(21%) who had > 152 weeks treatment.  
There  was  also  one  M02-537  dose  escalation  analysis  set,  which  included  all  subjects  who  were 
classified  as  undergoing dose  escalation.  The  subjects  increased  their  dose  of adalimumab  to  40  mg 
weekly. This dataset included 71 subjects. In the dose escalation subset, the median (range) of days on 
weekly treatments was 713 days (15 to 841 days), the mean (SD) exposure was 559 (251) days.  
Adverse events 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug 
Thirty-eight subjects (9.6%) discontinued due to an AE during adalimumab treatment either in Study 
M02 518 (6) or Study M02 570 (1) or Study M02 537 (31). Of the 38 subjects who withdrew because 
of  AEs,  4  did  so  following  dose  escalation.  Of  the  395  study  subjects,  21  (5.3%)  experienced 
23 treatment emergent AEs resulting in the discontinuation of study drug judged by the Investigator to 
be possibly or probably drug related. 
Severe AEs  were reported in 80 subjects (20.3% of all 395 subjects reporting at least one AE). The 
most commonly reported severe AEs were all reported by < 1% of subjects (myocardial infarction and 
psoriatic arthropathy each reported by 4 subjects, 1.0%). Table 6 shows an overview of adverse events

Treatment-emergent infectious adverse events 
The number and percent of subjects who reported treatment emergent infectious AEs (both non serious 
and serious) occurring in > 2% of subjects was presented. A total of 272 subjects (68.9%) reported at 
least  one  infectious  AE.  The  most  commonly  reported  infectious  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection  (104/395,  26.3%),  nasopharyngitis  (68/395,  17.2%),  sinusitis  (39/395,  9.9%),  influenza 
(29/395, 7.3%), bronchitis (27/395, 6.8%), herpes simplex (20/395, 5.1%), and urinary tract infection 
(20/395, 5.1%). All other infectious AEs were reported by < 5% of subjects. 
Of the 395 subjects, 21 (5.3%) reported a serious infectious AE. Twelve (3.0%) were considered by 
the  investigator  to  be  possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  drug,  including  abdominal  wall  abscess, 
urinary  tract  infection,  lobar  pneumonia  and  sepsis  syndrome,  extradural  abscess  and  intervertebral 
discitis, peritoneal tuberculosis, pacterial pericarditis, meningitis viral, pyelonephritis and diverticulitis 
Opportunistic Infections (Excluding TB) 
Four subjects (1.0%) reported treatment emergent opportunistic infections (excluding TB), in all cases 
oral or oesophageal candidiasis. One (0.3%) of the 395 subjects reported TB.  
Malignancies 
Overall, ten malignancies were reported in nine subjects (basal cell carcinoma (n=3), neuroendocrine 
carcinoma  of  the  skin,  B-cell  small  lymphocytic  lymphoma,  prostate  cancer  (n=2),  follicle  centre 
lymphoma,  squamous  cell  carcinoma).  One  subject  (518-2706)  reported  a  malignancy  (B-cell  small 
lymphocytic lymphoma) that was considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator.  
The CHMP noted that squamous cell carcinoma has been included into the SPC, section 4.8 as a rare 
event.  Furthermore,  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  (including both  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  basal 
cell  carcinoma)  are  mentioned  specifically  in  section  4.8,  with  higher  frequencies  observed  in 
adalimumab groups than in the placebo groups during the controlled portions of clinical trials.  
Injection Site Reactions 
Of  the  395  subjects,  54  (13.7%)  subjects  reported  treatment-emergent  injection  site  reactions 
(including injection site: bruising, erythema, haemorrhage, irritation, pain, pruritus, reaction, and rash) 
most of which were mild and assessed by the Investigator as probably related to study drug. 
Other events:  
No  subjects  with  treatment-emergent  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  demyelinating  disease, 
lupus/lupus-like syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF) or immunologic reactions were observed. 
Laboratory findings 
Small  mean  increases  in  hemoglobin;  hematocrit  and  red  blood  cells  (RBC)  were  observed  at  all 
evaluation  time  points.  Mean  white  blood  cells  (WBC)  values  decreased  during  treatment  with 
adalimumab  ranging  from  0.84 x103/µl  at  week  12  to  1.24 x103/µl  at  week 136.  Mean  changes  in 
WBC  differential  counts  showed  small  decreases  in  neutrophil  counts  and  small  increases  in 
lymphocyte  counts  at  all  time  points.  Mean  platelet  counts  decreased  at  all  time  points.  Changes 
observed  are  consistent  and  similar  to  subjects  treated  with  adalimumab  as  previously  seen  in  other 
studies. There were no clinically meaningful mean changes of clinical chemistry parameters or urine-
analyses over 136 weeks. 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
Although  a  few  statistically  significant  differences  were  detected,  analyses  of  the  most  commonly-
reported treatment-emergent AEs (i.e., those reported by > 5% of subjects in the safety analysis set) by 
Page 12 of 14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intrinsic  factors  did  not  indicate  any  clinically  relevant  differences  for  males  vs.  females, 
subjects < 65 years vs. those >65 years, Caucasians vs. non-Caucasians, or subjects with < 10 years of 
PsA vs. those with >10 years of PsA.  
Analyses  of  the  most  commonly-reported  treatment-emergent  AEs  (i.e.,  those  reported  by  >5%  of 
subjects  in  the  All  Studies  grouping)  by  extrinsic  factors  did  not  indicate  any  clinically  relevant 
differences  for  subjects  with  DMARD  use  at  baseline  vs.  those  without  and  subjects  with  oral 
corticosteroid use at baseline vs. those without. 
Safety in special populations 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Overall, four subjects became pregnant during this study. Two (0.5%) subjects were pregnant during 
the course of the study. One subject experienced an ectopic pregnancy and one subject chose to have 
an  elective  abortion.  Both  were  reported  as  SAEs.  Two  subjects  reported  pregnancies  following 
completion  of  open-label  adalimumab  treatment  (day  511  [62  days  post-treatment]  and  day  449  [70 
days post-treatment], respectively). Both delivered healthy babies.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
The  MAH  submitted  long-term  extension  data  from  the  open  label  study  M02-537,  which  included 
data up to and beyond 2 years of treatment of PsA patients with adalimumab. The already established 
safety profile of adalimumab is confirmed. Infections, including some serious and severe, occurred in 
association  with  adalimumab  treatment,  and  there  was  one  case  of  TB.  Malignancies  (n=10)  were 
reported  in  9  subjects,  and  further  support  the  need  for  continued  long-term  follow  up.  There  were 
71 patients  who  dose  escalated  to  40  mg  ew  during  the  study  period.  Although  the  safety  data 
presentation  in  subjects  who  dose-escalated  was  brief  in  the  report,  no  further  information  was 
requested, since the available data are limited and the higher dose is not approved for use in PsA. To 
conclude, there were no new safety signals identified.  
Risk management plan 
The CHMP considered that there was no need for an update of the RMP for this variation.  
Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
Humira was approved for the use in PsA in August 2005 (variation 22), with the following indication: 
“Humira is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response  to  previous  disease-modifying  anti  rheumatic  drug  therapy  has  been  inadequate.”  In  the 
present  variation  application  the  MAH  proposed  to  change  the  current  indication  to  add  that 
adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray 
and to improve physical function. 
Benefit  
Data on physical function have been assessed previously, and were included in the SPC, section 5.1. 
Data  showed  that  treatment  with  adalimumab  resulted  in  improved  physical  function,  measured  by 
various patient reported outcomes. The joint damage claim was based on newly submitted X-ray data 
from  study  M02-518  and  the  long-term  extension  study  M02-537.  The  effect  of  adalimumab  on 
progression  of  joint  damage  was  assessed  using  the  mTSS.  It  was  shown  that  adalimumab-treated 
subjects had statistically significantly less progression in mTSS from baseline to week 48 compared to 
placebo-treated subjects from baseline to week 24 (0.0 vs. 0.8, p<0.001). 
However, maintenance of reduced progression of joint damage was considered difficult to assess, due 
to the short placebo controlled period and poor knowledge about the natural progression rate in PsA. 
As symmetric PsA somewhat resembles RA, and based on experience from other anti-TNF agents and 
the  subgroup  analyses  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  considered  that  an  effect  in  subjects  with 
symmetrical  disease  could  be  agreed,  while  relevant  effects  in  subjects  with  asymmetrical  disease 
were less convincing.

Risk 
Based on the submitted data, the safety profile of adalimumab was confirmed. Overall, there were no 
new safety signals identified in this material.  
To  conclude,  there  is  support  for  that  adalimumab  treatment  reduced  the  rate  of  joint  damage 
progression  in  PsA.  Thus,  the  proposed  revised  indication  is  accepted,  with  the  patient  population 
specified to those having polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease.  
The benefit / risk balance remains positive. 
CONCLUSION 
On 13 December 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the SPC and PL.

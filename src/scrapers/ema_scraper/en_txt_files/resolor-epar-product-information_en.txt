CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Resolor is indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail 
to provide adequate relief.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults: 2 mg once daily with or without food, at any time of the day.
Due to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the 
daily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy.
If the intake of once daily prucalopride is not effective after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient should 
be re-examined and the benefit of continuing treatment reconsidered.
The efficacy of prucalopride has been established in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for up to 
3 months. Efficacy beyond three months has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled studies (see
Section 5.1). In case of prolonged treatment, the benefit should be reassessed at regular intervals.
Special populations
Older people (>65 years): Start with 1 mg once daily (see section 5.2); if needed the dose can be 
increased to 2 mg once daily.
Patients with renal impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment 
(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is 
required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Patients with hepatic impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start 
with 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg 
dose is well tolerated (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild 
to moderate hepatic impairment.
2
Paediatric population: Resolor should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years 
(see section 5.1).
Method of administration
Oral use
4.3 Contraindications
-
-
-
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Renal impairment requiring dialysis.
Intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, 
obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn’s disease, 
and ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride (see section 5.2). A dose of 1 mg is 
recommended in subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Resolor to patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
There is limited information on the safety and efficacy of Resolor for use in patients with severe and 
clinically unstable concomitant disease (e.g. cardiovascular or lung disease, neurological or psychiatric 
disorders, cancer or AIDS and other endocrine disorders). Caution should be exercised when 
prescribing Resolor to patients with these conditions especially when used in patients with a history of 
arrhythmias or ischaemic cardiovascular disease.
In case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an 
additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception (see
the prescribing information of the oral contraceptive).
The tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Prucalopride has a low pharmacokinetic interaction potential. It is extensively excreted unchanged in 
urine (approximately 60% of the dose) and in vitro metabolism is very slow.
Prucalopride did not inhibit specific CYP450 activities in in vitro studies in human liver microsomes 
at therapeutically relevant concentrations.
Although prucalopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp
at clinically relevant concentrations.
Effects of prucalopride on pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
A 30% increase in plasma concentrations of erythromycin was found during prucalopride 
co-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear.
Prucalopride had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, 
paroxetine or oral contraceptives.
Effects of other medicinal products on pharmacokinetics of prucalopride
Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic
exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant.
3
Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as 
verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.
Therapeutic doses of probenecid, cimetidine, erythromycin and paroxetine did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of prucalopride.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
prucalopride
Pregnancy
There is a limited amount of data from the use of prucalopride in pregnant women. Cases of 
spontaneous abortion have been observed during clinical studies, although, in the presence of other 
risk factors, the relationship to prucalopride is unknown. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (including pregnancy, embryonal/foetal 
development, parturition or postnatal development) (see section 5.3). Resolor is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
Breast-feeding
A human study has shown that prucalopride is excreted in breast milk. At therapeutic doses of 
Resolor, no effects on breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. In the absence of human data in 
women who actively breast-fed while taking Resolor, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Resolor therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
Animal studies indicate that there is no effect on male or female fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Resolor may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, since dizziness and 
fatigue have been observed in clinical studies, particularly during the first day of treatment (see 
section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In an integrated analysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled studies, Resolor was given orally to 
approximately 3,300 patients with chronic constipation. Of these, over 1,500 patients received Resolor 
at the recommended dose of 2 mg per day, while approximately 1,360 patients were treated with 4 mg 
prucalopride daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Resolor 2 mg 
therapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain (13.7%), nausea
(13.7%) and diarrhoea (12.0%)). The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and 
usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been 
reported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were reported in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose 
of 2 mg with frequencies corresponding to very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are calculated based on the integrated 
analysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.

Description of selected adverse reactions
After the first day of treatment, the most common adverse reactions were reported in similar 
frequencies (incidence no more than 1% different between prucalopride and placebo) during Resolor 
therapy as during placebo, with the exception of nausea and diarrhoea that still occurred more 
frequently during Resolor therapy, but less pronounced (differences in incidence between Resolor and 
placebo of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively).
Palpitations were reported in 0.7% of the placebo patients, 0.9% of the 1 mg prucalopride patients, 
0.9% of the 2 mg prucalopride patients and 1.9% of the 4 mg prucalopride patients. The majority of 
patients continued using prucalopride. As with any new symptom, patients should discuss the new 
onset of palpitations with their physician. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V
4.9 Overdose
In a study in healthy volunteers, treatment with prucalopride was well tolerated when given in an 
up-titrating scheme up to 20 mg once daily (10 times the recommended therapeutic dose). An 
overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride’s known 
pharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not 
available for Resolor overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated 
symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or
vomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for constipation, ATC code: A06AX05. 
Mechanism of action
Prucalopride is a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide with gastrointestinal prokinetic activities. 
Prucalopride is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist, which is likely to explain 
its prokinetic effects. In vitro, only at concentrations exceeding its 5-HT4 receptor affinity by at least 
150-fold, affinity for other receptors was detected. In rats, prucalopride in vivo, at doses above 
5 mg/kg (at and above 30-70 times the clinical exposure), induced hyperprolactinaemia caused by an 
antagonistic action at the D2 receptor. 
In dogs, prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it
stimulates proximal colonic motility, enhances gastroduodenal motility and accelerates delayed gastric 
emptying. Furthermore, giant migrating contractions are induced by prucalopride. These are 
equivalent to the colonic mass movements in humans, and provide the main propulsive force to 
defaecation. In dogs, the effects observed in the gastrointestinal tract are sensitive to blockade with 
selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists illustrating that the observed effects are exerted via selective 
action on 5-HT4 receptors.
These pharmacodynamic effects of prucalopride have been confirmed in human subjects with chronic 
constipation using manometry in an open-label, randomised, crossover, reader-blinded study 
investigating the effect of prucalopride 2 mg and an osmotic laxative on colon motility as determined 
by the number of colonic high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs, also known as giant 
migrating contractions). Compared with a constipation treatment working through osmotic action, 
prokinetic stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as measured by the number of 
HAPCs during the first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product. The clinical significance or 
benefit of this mechanism of action when compared with other laxatives has not been investigated.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Adult population
The efficacy of Resolor was established in three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week 
placebo-controlled studies in subjects with chronic constipation (n=1,279 on Resolor, 1,124 females, 
155 males). The Resolor doses studied in each of these three studies included 2 mg and 4 mg once 
daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion (%) of subjects that reached normalisation of 
bowel movements defined as an average of three or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements 
(SCBM) per week over the 12-week treatment period.
The proportion of female patients in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief treated with the 
recommended dose of 2 mg Resolor (n=458) that reached an average of ≥3 SCBM per week was 
31.0% (week 4) and 24.7% (week 12), versus 8.6% (week 4) and 9.2% (week 12) on placebo. A 
clinically meaningful improvement of ≥1 SCBM per week, the most important secondary efficacy 
endpoint, was achieved in 51.0% (week 4) and 44.2% (week 12) treated with 2 mg Resolor versus 
21.7% (week 4) and 22.6% (week 12) of placebo patients.
The effect of Resolor on spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) also proved to be statistically superior 
to placebo for the portion of patients that had an increase of ≥1 SBM/week over the 12-week treatment 
period. At week 12, 68.3% of patients treated with 2 mg prucalopride had an average increase of 
≥1 SBM/week versus 37.0% of placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo).
In all three studies, treatment with Resolor also resulted in significant improvements in a validated and 
disease specific set of symptom measures (PAC-SYM), including abdominal (bloating, discomfort, 
pain and cramps), stool (incomplete bowel movements, false alarm, straining, too hard, too small) and 
6
rectal symptoms (painful bowel movements, burning, bleeding/tearing), determined at week 4 and 
week 12. At week 4, the proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥1 versus baseline in the 
PAC-SYM abdominal, stool, and rectal symptom subscales was 41.3%, 41.6%, and 31.3% 
respectively in patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared with 26.9%, 24.4% and 22.9% in
patients on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 43.4%, 42.9%, and 31.7% respectively
in 2 mg Resolor patients versus 26.9%, 27.2%, and 23.4% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo).
A significant benefit on a number of Quality of Life measures, such as degree of satisfaction with 
treatment and with bowel habits, physical and psychosocial discomfort and worries and concerns, was 
also observed at both the 4 and 12 week assessment time points. At Week 4, the proportion of patients 
with an improvement of ≥1 versus baseline in the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life 
satisfaction subscale (PAC-QOL) was 47.7% in patients treated with Resolor 2 mg compared with 
20.2% in patients on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 46.9% in 2 mg Resolor
patients versus 19.0% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo).
In addition, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Resolor in male patients with chronic constipation 
were evaluated in a 12-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo–controlled study 
(N=370). The primary endpoint of the study was met: a statistically significantly higher percentage of 
subjects in the Resolor group (37.9%) had an average of ≥3 SCBMs/week compared with subjects in 
the placebo treatment group (17.7%) (p<0.0001) over the 12-week double-blind treatment period. The 
safety profile of Resolor was consistent with that seen in female patients.
Long-term study
The efficacy and safety of Resolor in patients (aged ≥18 or older) with chronic constipation, were 
evaluated in a 24 week multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (N=361). The 
proportion of patients with an average weekly frequency of ≥3 Spontaneous Complete Bowel 
Movements (SCBMs) per week (i.e., responders) over the 24-week double-blind treatment phase was 
not statistically different (p=0.367) between the Resolor (25.1%) and placebo (20.7%) treatment 
groups. The difference between treatment groups in the average weekly frequency of ≥3 SCBMs per 
week was not statistically significant over Weeks 1-12 which is inconsistent with the 5 other 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week placebo controlled studies demonstrating efficacy at 
this timepoint in adult patients. The study is therefore considered to be inconclusive with respect to 
efficacy. However, the totality of the data including the other double-blind placebo controlled 12 week 
studies support the efficacy of Resolor. The safety profile of prucalopride in this 24 week study was 
consistent with that seen in the previous 12 week studies.
Resolor has been shown not to cause rebound phenomena, nor to induce dependency.
TQT study
A thorough QT study was performed to evaluate the effects of Resolor on the QT interval at 
therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic doses (10 mg) and compared with the effects of placebo and a 
positive control. This study did not show significant differences between Resolor and placebo at either 
dose, based on mean QT measurements and outlier analysis. This confirmed the results of two placebo 
controlled QT studies. In double-blind clinical studies, the incidence of QT-related adverse events and 
ventricular arrhythmias was low and comparable to placebo.
Paediatric population
The efficacy and safety of Resolor in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 18 years) with functional 
constipation, were evaluated in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N=213), followed by 
a 16 week open-label comparator-controlled (Polyethylene glycol 4000) study of up to 24 weeks 
(N=197). The starting dose administered was 0.04 mg/kg/day titrated between 0.02 and 
0.06 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 2 mg daily) for children weighing ≤50 kg given as an oral solution 
of Resolor or matching placebo. Children weighing >50 kg received 2 mg/day Resolor tablets or 
matching placebo.
Response to the treatment was defined as having an average of ≥3 spontaneous bowel movements
(SBMs) per week and an average number of faecal incontinence episodes of ≤1 per 2 weeks. The
7
results of the study showed no difference in efficacy between Resolor and placebo with response rates 
of 17% and 17.8% respectively (P=0.9002). Resolor was generally well tolerated. The incidence of 
subjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between the Resolor
treatment group (69.8%) and the placebo treatment group (60.7%). Overall, the safety profile of 
Resolor in children was the same as in adults.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Prucalopride is rapidly absorbed; after a single oral dose of 2 mg in healthy subjects, Cmax was attained 
in 2-3 hours. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Concomitant intake of food does not influence 
the oral bioavailability of prucalopride.
Distribution
Prucalopride is extensively distributed, and has a steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) of 
567 litres. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is about 30%.
Biotransformation
Metabolism is not the major route of elimination of prucalopride. In vitro, human liver metabolism is 
very slow and only minor amounts of metabolites are found. In an oral dose study with radiolabelled 
prucalopride in man, small amounts of seven metabolites were recovered in urine and faeces. The 
quantitatively most important metabolite in excreta, R107504, accounted for 3.2% and 3.1% of the 
dose in urine and faeces, respectively. Other metabolites identified and quantified in urine and faeces 
were R084536 (formed by N-dealkylation) accounting for 3% of the dose and products of 
hydroxylation (3% of the dose) and N-oxidation (2% of the dose). Unchanged active substance made 
up about 92-94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. R107504, R084536 and R104065 (formed by 
O-demethylation) were identified as minor plasma metabolites.
Elimination
A large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (60-65% of the administered dose in 
urine and about 5% in faeces). Renal excretion of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive 
filtration and active secretion. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 ml/min. Its terminal 
half-life is about one day. Steady-state is reached within three to four days. On once daily treatment 
with 2 mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values 
of 2.5 and 7 ng/ml, respectively. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 
to 2.3. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic 
range (tested up to 20 mg). Prucalopride o.d. displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged 
treatment.
Special populations
Population pharmacokinetics
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent total clearance of prucalopride was 
correlated with creatinine clearance, but that age, body weight, sex or race had no influence.
Older people
After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations and AUC of prucalopride in older people
were 26% to 28% higher than in young adults. This effect can be attributed to a diminished renal 
function in older people.
Renal impairment
Compared to subjects with normal renal function, plasma concentrations of prucalopride after a single 
2 mg dose were on average 25% and 51% higher in subjects with mild (ClCR 50-79 ml/min) and 
moderate (ClCR 25-49 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively. In subjects with severe renal 
impairment (ClCR ≤24 ml/min), plasma concentrations were 2.3 times the levels in healthy subjects 
(see section 4.2 and 4.4).
8
Hepatic impairment
Non-renal elimination contributes to about 35% of total elimination. In a small pharmacokinetic study, 
the Cmax and AUC of prucalopride were, on average, 10-20% higher in patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. An extended series of safety pharmacology studies with special 
emphasis on cardiovascular parameters showed no relevant changes in haemodynamic and ECG 
derived parameters (QTc) with the exception of a modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure
observed in anaesthetised pigs after intravenous administration, and an increase in blood pressure in 
conscious dogs after bolus intravenous administration, which was not observed either in anaesthetised
dogs or after oral administration in dogs reaching similar plasma levels. A subcutaneous 
neonatal/juvenile toxicity study performed in rats 7-55 days of age resulted in a NOAEL of 
10 mg/kg/day. The AUC0-24h exposure ratios at the NOAEL versus human children (dosed at 
approximately 0.04 mg/kg daily) ranged between 21 and 71 providing adequate safety margins for the 
clinical dose.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Resolor is indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail 
to provide adequate relief.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults: 2 mg once daily with or without food, at any time of day.
Due to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the 
daily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy.
If the intake of once daily prucalopride is not effective after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient should 
be re-examined and the benefit of continuing treatment reconsidered.
The efficacy of prucalopride has been established in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for up to 
3 months. Efficacy beyond three months has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled studies (see
Section 5.1). In case of prolonged treatment, the benefit should be reassessed at regular intervals.
Special populations
Older people (>65 years): Start with 1 mg once daily (see section 5.2); if needed the dose can be 
increased to 2 mg once daily.
Patients with renal impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment 
(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is 
required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Patients with hepatic impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start 
with 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg 
dose is well tolerated (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild 
to moderate hepatic impairment.
Paediatric population: Resolor should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years 
(see section 5.1).

-
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Renal impairment requiring dialysis.
Intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, 
obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn’s disease, 
and ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride (see section 5.2). A dose of 1 mg is 
recommended in subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Resolor to patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
There is limited information on the safety and efficacy of Resolor for use in patients with severe and 
clinically unstable concomitant disease (e.g. cardiovascular or lung disease, neurological or psychiatric 
disorders, cancer or AIDS and other endocrine disorders). Caution should be exercised when 
prescribing Resolor to patients with these conditions especially when used in patients with a history of 
arrhythmias or ischaemic cardiovascular disease.
In case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an 
additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception (see 
the prescribing information of the oral contraceptive).
The tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Prucalopride has a low pharmacokinetic interaction potential. It is extensively excreted unchanged in 
urine (approximately 60% of the dose) and in vitro metabolism is very slow.
Prucalopride did not inhibit specific CYP450 activities in in vitro studies in human liver microsomes 
at therapeutically relevant concentrations.
Although prucalopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp 
at clinically relevant concentrations.
Effects of prucalopride on pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
A 30% increase in plasma concentrations of erythromycin was found during prucalopride 
co-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear.
Prucalopride had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, 
paroxetine or oral contraceptives.
Effects of other medicinal products on pharmacokinetics of prucalopride
Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic 
exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. 
Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as 
verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.

Therapeutic doses of probenecid, cimetidine, erythromycin and paroxetine did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of prucalopride.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
prucalopride
Pregnancy
There is a limited amount of data from the use of prucalopride in pregnant women. Cases of 
spontaneous abortion have been observed during clinical studies, although, in the presence of other 
risk factors, the relationship to prucalopride is unknown. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (including pregnancy, embryonal/foetal 
development, parturition or postnatal development) (see section 5.3). Resolor is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
Breast-feeding
A human study has shown that prucalopride is excreted in breast milk. At therapeutic doses of 
Resolor, no effects on breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. In the absence of human data in 
women who actively breast-fed while taking Resolor, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Resolor therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
Animal studies indicate that there is no effect on male or female fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Resolor may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, since dizziness and 
fatigue have been observed in clinical studies, particularly during the first day of treatment (see 
section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In an integrated analysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled studies, Resolor was given orally to 
approximately 3,300 patients with chronic constipation. Of these, over 1,500 patients received Resolor 
at the recommended dose of 2 mg per day, while approximately 1,360 patients were treated with 4 mg 
prucalopride daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Resolor 2 mg 
therapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain (13.7%), nausea
(13.7%) and diarrhoea (12.0%)). The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and 
usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been 
reported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were reported in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose 
of 2 mg with frequencies corresponding to very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects 
are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are calculated based on the integrated 
analysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.

Description of selected adverse reactions
After the first day of treatment, the most common adverse reactions were reported in similar 
frequencies (incidence no more than 1% different between prucalopride and placebo) during Resolor 
therapy as during placebo, with the exception of nausea and diarrhoea that still occurred more
frequently during Resolor therapy, but less pronounced (differences in incidence between Resolor and 
placebo of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively).
Palpitations were reported in 0.7% of the placebo patients, 0.9% of the 1 mg prucalopride patients, 
0.9% of the 2 mg prucalopride patients and 1.9% of the 4 mg prucalopride patients. The majority of 
patients continued using prucalopride. As with any new symptom, patients should discuss the new 
onset of palpitations with their physician.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V
4.9 Overdose
In a study in healthy volunteers, treatment with prucalopride was well tolerated when given in an 
up-titrating scheme up to 20 mg once daily (10 times the recommended therapeutic dose). An 
overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride’s known 
pharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not 
available for Resolor overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated 
symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or 
vomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for constipation, ATC code: A06AX05.
Mechanism of action
Prucalopride is a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide with gastrointestinal prokinetic activities. 
Prucalopride is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist, which is likely to explain 
its prokinetic effects. In vitro, only at concentrations exceeding its 5-HT4 receptor affinity by at least 
150-fold, affinity for other receptors was detected. In rats, prucalopride in vivo, at doses above 
5 mg/kg (at and above 30-70 times the clinical exposure), induced hyperprolactinaemia caused by an 
antagonistic action at the D2 receptor. 
In dogs, prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it
stimulates proximal colonic motility, enhances gastroduodenal motility and accelerates delayed gastric 
emptying. Furthermore, giant migrating contractions are induced by prucalopride. These are 
equivalent to the colonic mass movements in humans, and provide the main propulsive force to 
defaecation. In dogs, the effects observed in the gastrointestinal tract are sensitive to blockade with 
selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists illustrating that the observed effects are exerted via selective 
action on 5-HT4 receptors.
These pharmacodynamic effects of prucalopride have been confirmed in human subjects with chronic 
constipation using manometry in an open-label, randomised, crossover, reader-blinded study 
investigating the effect of prucalopride 2 mg and an osmotic laxative on colon motility as determined 
by the number of colonic high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs, also known as giant 
migrating contractions). Compared with a constipation treatment working through osmotic action, 
prokinetic stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as measured by the number of 
HAPCs during the first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product. The clinical significance or 
benefit of this mechanism of action when compared with other laxatives has not been investigated.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Adult population
The efficacy of Resolor was established in three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week 
placebo-controlled studies in subjects with chronic constipation (n=1,279 on Resolor, 1,124 females, 
155 males). The Resolor doses studied in each of these three studies included 2 mg and 4 mg once 
daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion (%) of subjects that reached normalisation of 
bowel movements defined as an average of three or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements 
(SCBM) per week over the 12-week treatment period.
The proportion of female patients in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief treated with the 
recommended dose of 2 mg Resolor (n=458) that reached an average of ≥3 SCBM per week was 
31.0% (week 4) and 24.7% (week 12), versus 8.6% (week 4) and 9.2% (week 12) on placebo. A 
clinically meaningful improvement of ≥1 SCBM per week, the most important secondary efficacy 
endpoint, was achieved in 51.0% (week 4) and 44.2% (week 12) treated with 2 mg Resolor versus 
21.7% (week 4) and 22.6% (week 12) of placebo patients.
The effect of Resolor on spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) also proved to be statistically superior 
to placebo for the portion of patients that had an increase of ≥1 SBM/week over the 12-week treatment 
period. At week 12, 68.3% of patients treated with 2 mg Resolor had an average increase of 
≥1 SBM/week versus 37.0% of placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo).
In all three studies, treatment with Resolor also resulted in significant improvements in a validated and 
disease specific set of symptom measures (PAC-SYM), including abdominal (bloating, discomfort, 
pain and cramps), stool (incomplete bowel movements, false alarm, straining, too hard, too small) and 
15
rectal symptoms (painful bowel movements, burning, bleeding/tearing), determined at week 4 and 
week 12. At week 4, the proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥1 versus baseline in the 
PAC-SYM abdominal, stool, and rectal symptom subscales was 41.3%, 41.6%, and 31.3% 
respectively in patients treated with Resolor 2 mg compared with 26.9%, 24.4% and 22.9% in patients 
on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 43.4%, 42.9%, and 31.7% respectively in 2 mg 
Resolor patients versus 26.9%, 27.2%, and 23.4% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo).
A significant benefit on a number of Quality of Life measures, such as degree of satisfaction with 
treatment and with bowel habits, physical and psychosocial discomfort and worries and concerns, was 
also observed at both the 4 and 12 week assessment time points. At Week 4, the proportion of patients 
with an improvement of ≥1 versus baseline in the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life 
satisfaction subscale (PAC-QOL) was 47.7% in patients treated with Resolor 2 mg compared with 
20.2% in patients on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 46.9% in 2 mg Resolor
patients versus 19.0% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo).
In addition, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Resolor in male patients with chronic constipation 
were evaluated in a 12-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo–controlled study 
(N=370). The primary endpoint of the study was met: a statistically significantly higher percentage of 
subjects in the Resolor group (37.9%) had an average of ≥3 SCBMs/week compared with subjects in 
the placebo treatment group (17.7%) (p<0.0001) over the 12-week double-blind treatment period. The 
safety profile of Resolor was consistent with that seen in female patients.
Long-term study
The efficacy and safety of Resolor in patients (aged ≥18 or older) with chronic constipation, were 
evaluated in a 24 week multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (N=361). The 
proportion of patients with an average weekly frequency of ≥3 Spontaneous Complete Bowel 
Movements (SCBMs) per week (i.e., responders) over the 24-week double-blind treatment phase was 
not statistically different (p=0.367) between the prucalopride (25.1%) and placebo (20.7%) treatment 
groups. The difference between treatment groups in the average weekly frequency of ≥3 SCBMs per 
week was not statistically significant over Weeks 1-12 which is inconsistent with the 5 other
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week placebo controlled studies demonstrating efficacy at 
this timepoint in adult patients. The study is therefore considered to be inconclusive with respect to 
efficacy. However, the totality of the data including the other double-blind placebo controlled 12 week 
studies support the efficacy of Resolor. The safety profile of Resolor in this 24 week study was 
consistent with that seen in the previous 12 week studies.
Resolor has been shown not to cause rebound phenomena, nor to induce dependency.
TQT study
A thorough QT study was performed to evaluate the effects of Resolor on the QT interval at 
therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic doses (10 mg) and compared with the effects of placebo and a 
positive control. This study did not show significant differences between Resolor and placebo at either 
dose, based on mean QT measurements and outlier analysis. This confirmed the results of two placebo 
controlled QT studies. In double-blind clinical studies, the incidence of QT-related adverse events and 
ventricular arrhythmias was low and comparable to placebo.
Paediatric population
The efficacy and safety of Resolor in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 18 years) with functional 
constipation, were evaluated in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N=213), followed by 
a 16 week open-label comparator-controlled (Polyethylene glycol 4000) study of up to 24 weeks 
(N=197). The starting dose administered was 0.04 mg/kg/day titrated between 0.02 and 
0.06 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 2 mg daily) for children weighing ≤50 kg given as an oral solution 
of Resolor or matching placebo. Children weighing >50 kg received 2 mg/day Resolor tablets or 
matching placebo.
Response to the treatment was defined as having an average of ≥3 spontaneous bowel movements
(SBMs) per week and an average number of faecal incontinence episodes of ≤1 per 2 weeks. The
16
results of the study showed no difference in efficacy between Resolor and placebo with response rates 
of 17% and 17.8% respectively (P=0.9002). Resolor was generally well tolerated. The incidence of 
subjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between the Resolor
treatment group (69.8%) and the placebo treatment group (60.7%). Overall, the safety profile of 
Resolor in children was the same as in adults.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Prucalopride is rapidly absorbed; after a single oral dose of 2 mg in healthy subjects, Cmax was attained 
in 2-3 hours. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Concomitant intake of food does not influence 
the oral bioavailability of prucalopride.
Distribution
Prucalopride is extensively distributed, and has a steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) of 
567 litres. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is about 30%.
Biotransformation
Metabolism is not the major route of elimination of prucalopride. In vitro, human liver metabolism is 
very slow and only minor amounts of metabolites are found. In an oral dose study with radiolabelled 
prucalopride in man, small amounts of seven metabolites were recovered in urine and faeces. The 
quantitatively most important metabolite in excreta, R107504, accounted for 3.2% and 3.1% of the 
dose in urine and faeces, respectively. Other metabolites identified and quantified in urine and faeces 
were R084536 (formed by N-dealkylation) accounting for 3% of the dose and products of 
hydroxylation (3% of the dose) and N-oxidation (2% of the dose). Unchanged active substance made 
up about 92-94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. R107504, R084536 and R104065 (formed by 
O-demethylation) were identified as minor plasma metabolites.
Elimination
A large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (60-65% of the administered dose in 
urine and about 5% in faeces). Renal excretion of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive 
filtration and active secretion. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 ml/min. Its terminal 
half-life is about one day. Steady-state is reached within three to four days. On once daily treatment 
with 2 mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values 
of 2.5 and 7 ng/ml, respectively. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9
to 2.3. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic 
range (tested up to 20 mg). Prucalopride o.d. displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged 
treatment.
Special populations
Population pharmacokinetics
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent total clearance of prucalopride was 
correlated with creatinine clearance, but that age, body weight, sex or race had no influence.
Older people
After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations and AUC of prucalopride in older people 
were 26% to 28% higher than in young adults. This effect can be attributed to a diminished renal 
function in older people.
Renal impairment
Compared to subjects with normal renal function, plasma concentrations of prucalopride after a single 
2 mg dose were on average 25% and 51% higher in subjects with mild (ClCR 50-79 ml/min) and 
moderate (ClCR 25-49 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively. In subjects with severe renal 
impairment (ClCR ≤24 ml/min), plasma concentrations were 2.3 times the levels in healthy subjects 
(see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
17
Hepatic impairment
Non-renal elimination contributes to about 35% of total elimination. In a small pharmacokinetic study, 
the Cmax and AUC of prucalopride were, on average, 10-20% higher in patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. An extended series of safety pharmacology studies with special 
emphasis on cardiovascular parameters showed no relevant changes in haemodynamic and ECG 
derived parameters (QTc) with the exception of a modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure
observed in anaesthetised pigs after intravenous administration, and an increase in blood pressure in 
conscious dogs after bolus intravenous administration, which was not observed either in anaesthetised 
dogs or after oral administration in dogs reaching similar plasma levels. A subcutaneous 
neonatal/juvenile toxicity study performed in rats 7-55 days of age resulted in a NOAEL of 
10 mg/kg/day. The AUC0-24h exposure ratios at the NOAEL versus human children (dosed at 
approximately 0.04 mg/kg daily) ranged between 21 and 71 providing adequate safety margins for the 
clinical dose.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Resolor is and what it is used for
Resolor contains the active substance prucalopride.
Resolor belongs to a group of gut motility enhancing medicines (gastrointestinal prokinetics). It acts 
on the muscle wall of the gut, helping to restore the normal functioning of the bowel. Resolor is used 
for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives do not work well enough.
Not for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years.
2. What you need to know before you take Resolor
Do not take Resolor:
-
if you are allergic to prucalopride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
if you are on renal dialysis,
if you suffer from perforation or obstruction of the gut wall, severe inflammation of the 
intestinal tract, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon/megarectum.
-
-
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Resolor.
Take special care with Resolor and tell your doctor if you:
-
-
-
suffer from severe kidney disease,
suffer from severe liver disease,

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Xultophy 
insulin degludec / liraglutide 
On 26 April 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Xultophy. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novo Nordisk A/S. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows2: 
"Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in combination with 
oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with a GLP-1 receptor 
agonist or basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control in addition to other oral 
medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. (For study results with respect to 
combinations, effects on glycaemic control, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 
4.5 and 5.1 for available data on the different combinations)." 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

days from adoption of the opinion

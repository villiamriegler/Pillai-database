The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. RMP version 12.0 has also been submitted. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor corrections and editorial changes to the 
SmPC.  
C.I.11.b – Submission of an updated RMP version 12.0 to update the educational material section Part 
V.2, additional Risk Minimisation Measures, for HyQvia. The change was agreed by the PRAC in the 
outcome of the PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001633/202005.  
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (IGI 10%) with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is a product 
combination (HyQvia) for facilitated subcutaneous administration of the IGI 10% for replacement therapy 
in primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. The medicinal product is provided as two components in a 
dual vial unit in an inseparable kit arrangement. Medication errors, including confusion of the 
administration order of the components, is considered an important potential risk. An increase in 
medication error reports triggered the introduction of educational material as additional risk minimization 
measure. 
The pregnancy registry study 161301 was a commitment to the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP) and the FDA, and aimed to address safety concerns in women who become pregnant 
during or after treatment with HyQvia (including assessment of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies), as well as the 
physical and neurological development of the infant during the first 2 years of life. 
Study 161301 was a non-interventional, uncontrolled, two-arm, open-label, multicentre post-
authorization pregnancy registry of women treated with HyQvia and open for enrollment for 3.5 years. 
The study had 2 arms based on whether or not HyQvia treatment was continued during pregnancy and 
patients were also included retrospectively.  
Type II group of variations assessment report

A total of 9 mothers were enrolled, 7 were included in the retrospective cohort, of which 5 completed 
follow up, and 2 were included in the prospective cohort, and completed follow up. Data on HyQvia 
treatment was available for 6 (85.7%) mothers in the HyQvia Arm (4 mothers in the retrospective cohort 
and 2 mothers in the prospective cohort). These patients received a total of 26 infusions. Adverse events 
reported in HyQvia Arm of the registry were not consistent with the most common adverse reactions 
observed in clinical trials with HyQvia. A total of 2 SAEs were reported in 1 (11.1%) mother who was in 
HyQvia Arm and from the Prospective cohort (PT: thrombocytopenia; pre-eclampsia). None of the SAEs 
were assessed as related to HyQvia treatment. None of the (non-serious) AEs reported in the study were 
assessed as related to previous or current HyQvia treatment in the mother, or caused HyQvia treatment 
changes.  
Four mothers were tested for anti-rHuPH20 binding or neutralizing antibodies (2 in the HyQvia Arm, 2 
Alternative Product Arm) and no antibodies were detected but the significance of this finding is limited. 
Data accuracy and presentation could have been improved in the study report and Clinical Overview 
Addendum. 
Five mothers continued HyQvia treatment during the pregnancy (2 mothers enrolled before delivery and 3 
mothers enrolled after delivery with ongoing HyQvia treatment at the screening visit) and all had live 
births, with normal APGAR scores. By the end of the study, a total of 7 infants were included in the 
Enrolled set, of which 5 were included in the Retrospective cohort and 2 in the Prospective cohort. Two 
out of 5 (40.0%) infants (all in HyQvia Arm) had presence of congenital malformations/ anomaly that 
were assessed as mild in severity (Cleft lip, Talipes) and were assessed as not related to their mother's 
previous and current HyQvia treatment. Data on infant follow up was incomplete, highly fragmented, 
inaccurately described and the data presentation in the study report could have been greatly improved. 
Overall, the study report’s conclusion appears overstated in view of the very small sample size and 
fragmented data but no new significant safety concerns emerged. Due to the still limited information on 
safety in pregnant and lactating women, any cases of drug exposure during pregnancy should be follow-
up and presented in PSURs as cases of special interest. Participation in registries that aim to assess 
outcome of drug exposure during pregnancy (cf. EUROCAT network) could be encouraged in such cases.  
The benefit-risk balance of HyQvia remains positive.

Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
4.  EPAR changes 
The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above  
Summary 
In view of the very limited data from the result of a non-interventional, prospective, uncontrolled, two-
arm, open-label, multicentre post-authorisation pregnancy registry of women treated with HyQvia, 
section 4.6 of the SmPC has been updated to state that from a total of nine women enrolled in this study, 
and of the eight pregnancies with known outcomes, there were eight live births with normal APGAR 
scores. There were no specified labor or delivery complications. Four mothers were tested for 
anti-rHuPH20 binding or neutralizing antibodies and no antibodies were detected.  
Subsection Breast-feeding of section 4.6 has been updated to add that one infant in the study was 
breastfed and that all adverse events were reported as not related to previous or current HyQvia 
treatment. 
Section B point 2 of the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly and several editorial changes that do not 
change the content of the previously approved SmPC are introduced in sections 3, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.7.

5.  Introduction 
Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (IGI 10%) with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is a product 
combination (HyQvia) for facilitated subcutaneous administration of the IGI 10%. HyQvia is intended for 
use in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years) for replacement therapy in primary 
immunodeficiency syndromes (PID) and in secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer 
from severe or recurrent infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific 
antibody failure (PSAF) or serum IgG level of <4 g/l. 
The medicinal product is provided as two components in a dual vial unit in an inseparable kit 
arrangement. Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), classified as an excipient, is a solution for 
subcutaneous injection that functions as a permeation enhancer. The two components are administered 
sequentially through the same needle beginning with the recombinant human hyaluronidase followed by 
IGI 10%. Medication errors, including confusion of the administration order of the components, is 
considered an important potential risk.  
The pregnancy registry study 161301 was a commitment to the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP) and the FDA, and aimed to address safety concerns in women who become pregnant 
during or after treatment with HyQvia (including assessment of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies), as well as the 
physical and neurological development of the infant during the first 2 years of life. 
6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
6.1.  Topic 1 - study 161301 (Pregnancy Registry) 
6.1.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study 161301 was a non-interventional, prospective, uncontrolled, two-arm, open-label, multicentre 
post-authorization pregnancy registry of women treated with HyQvia. The study was conducted at 8 sites 
across US (n=1), Czech Republic (n=1), Germany (n=3), Poland (n=1), and Slovakia (n=2). The 
enrollment was open for approximately 3.5 years. There was no pre-specified minimum sample size for 
this registry. 
The study had 2 arms based on whether or not HyQvia treatment was continued during pregnancy. 
•  Study Arm 1 (Alternative Product Arm): subjects who stopped HyQvia treatment (if the subjects 
were still treated) and a licensed human normal immunoglobulin other than HyQvia for IV or SC 
infusion or an alternative treatment were administered, as determined by the treating physician. 
Subjects in countries where HyQvia treatment during pregnancy was not indicated were enrolled 
in Study Arm 1. The date and gestational age were collected for any subject in the Alternative 
Product Arm who restarted HyQvia. 
•  Study Arm 2 (HyQvia Arm): subjects who continued to receive HyQvia according to their 
treatment regimen. 
Patients could also been included retrospectively.

Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in expectant mothers and 
infants. 
Secondary Endpoints 
• Incidence of non-serious AEs, related and not related to HyQvia/human normal IG or alternative 
treatment (expectant mothers and infants) 
• Incidence of local/immunologic AEs, including skin changes (such as: local erythema, local pruritus, 
induration, nodules) (expectant mothers) 
• Development of antibodies against rHuPH20 (rHuPH20 binding and neutralizing antibodies) (expectant 
mothers) 
• Complications of pregnancy 
• Fetal growth/development 
• Outcome of pregnancy 
• Neonatal assessment 
• Status of the infant at birth 
• Growth measurement and charts for the infant, if available 
• Development milestones determined by standard test methods, for each region, if available

6.1.2.  Results 
A total of 9 mothers were screened for the study and enrolled. Seven (7) mothers were included in the 
retrospective cohort, of which 5 (77.8%) completed follow up, and 2 mothers were included in the 
prospective cohort, of which all completed follow up.  
Data on the actual HyQvia treatment was available for 6 (85.7%) mothers in the HyQvia Arm (4 mothers 
in the retrospective cohort and 2 mothers in the prospective cohort). These patients received a total of 26 
infusions, with 96.2% of infusions being administered at home. 
From the 9 mothers, 2 of their infants were not enrolled in the study because one mother withdrew 
consent prior to delivery and the pregnancy outcome is unknown and the other mother was lost to follow-
up after delivery and did not consent her infant to be included in the study. By the end of the study, a 
total of 7 infants were included in the Enrolled set, of which 5 were included in the Retrospective cohort 
and 2 in the Prospective cohort. 
Adverse events reported in HyQvia Arm of the registry were not consistent with the most common 
adverse reactions observed in clinical trials with HyQvia. A total of 2 SAEs were reported in 1 (11.1%) 
mother who was in HyQvia Arm and from the Prospective cohort, including blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (PT: thrombocytopenia; n=1, 14.3%) and pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions (PT: 
pre-eclampsia; n=1, 14.3%). None of the SAEs were assessed as related to HyQvia treatment. None of 
the (non-serious) AEs reported in the study were assessed as related to previous or current HyQvia 
treatment in the mother, or caused HyQvia treatment changes (i.e., dose reduction, interruption, 
withdrawal). No anti-rHuPH20 binding or neutralizing antibodies (four mothers tested), or local and 
immunologic AEs were reported in this registry that were assessed as related. Five mothers continued 
HyQvia treatment during the pregnancy (2 mothers enrolled before delivery and 3 mothers enrolled after 
delivery with ongoing HyQvia treatment at the screening visit) and all had live births, with normal APGAR 
scores.

Two out of 5 (40.0%) infants (all in HyQvia Arm) had presence of congenital malformations/anomaly that 
were assessed as mild in severity (Cleft lip, Talipes) and were assessed as not related to their mother's 
previous and current HyQvia treatment.  
At approximately 6-month follow-up, no congenital malformations diagnosed that were not reported at 
birth or conditions that were noted since birth were reported (data available for 2 out of 7 infants). Of the 
infants with weight information (n=3, 42.9%), all had normal weight. Length and head circumference 
information was available in 2 (28.6%) infants, of these, all infants had normal length and head 
circumference. Information on breastfeeding at the 6-month follow-up was available for one infant. 
At approximately 12-month follow-up, weight, length and head circumference information was available 
in 2 (28.6%) infants, all with normal measurements. Information on breastfeeding at the time of the 12-
months follow-up was available for 1 (14.3%) infant, who was breastfed, but breastfeeding duration was 
not available. 
At approximately 18-months follow-up, weight, length and head circumference information was available 
in 1 (14.3%) infant, with normal measurements. Information on developmental milestones were available 
in 1 (14.3%) infant who had no evidence of missed developmental milestones. 
At approximately 24-months follow-up, weight, length and head circumference information was available 
in 1 (14.3%) infant who had normal measurements. Two (28.6%) infants had available information on 
developmental milestones with one of them reporting to have missed milestones at the 24-month follow-
up. The infant that reported having missed milestones, did reach ‘sat up without support’, ‘turned to 
locate voice’, and ‘stand without support/help’ milestones, and had unknown information on the 
milestones of rolled over, attend to and reached object, and said first words. 
6.1.3.  Discussion 
In view of the very small sample size and fragmented data, in particular for the infants, the study report’s 
conclusion appears overstated. Data presentation could be greatly improved. According to the MAH the 
small sample size of the registry study is related to the restricted pregnancy wording in the US and EEA 
product information.  
The report often states that no unexpected measurements or events were reported but it is not clear 
whether this information was actually available for all individuals or just individual subjects. For example, 
at 6-month follow-up of infants, it is stated that no congenital malformations diagnosed that were not 
reported at birth or conditions that were noted since birth were reported, which sounds positive. 
However, according to the listings in the annex, it appears that this data was only available for 2 out of 7 
infants in which case the initial statement is misleading. While the MAH states that at the 12-month 
follow-up, all available weight and length measurements were normal, it appears from the listing in the 
annex that measurements were rather unusual for one child (on day 365: length 57 cm, weight 6.27 kg, 
head circumference 38.7 cm), which should be discussed in more detail even though the mother was in 
the alternative product arm.  
With respect to the mothers, anti-rHuPH20 antibody assessments were intended to be performed every 3 
months. However, the two mothers in the HyQvia arm were tested only once. In total four mothers were 
tested and no antibodies were detected but the significance of this finding is limited.  
It is positive to note that 7 mothers gave birth to live and healthy children. The statement that the 
growth and development of infants were followed for up to 2 years post-delivery appears to be true for 
one (1) child; even six months after birth data was available for less than half of the enrolled infants and 
only for some parameters. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn on the physical and neurological 
development of infants during the first 2 years if mothers were exposed to HyQvia during pregnancy. 
Type II group of variations assessment report  
EMA/622537/2021 
Page 10/24 
 
 
 
 
Any cases of drug exposure during pregnancy should be follow-up and presented in future PSURs as 
cases of special interest. In such cases, participation in registries that aim to assess outcome of drug 
exposure during pregnancy (cf. EUROCAT network) could also be encouraged.  
In summary, the limited sample size of the pregnancy registry precludes any scientific robust conclusion. 
The proposed revision of section 4.6 of the SmPC therefore needs to be revised substantially.   
6.2.  Topic 2 - Additional Risk Minimisation Measures: Educational Material  
6.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
No new data was submitted. In the last PSUR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001633/202005), a high reporting 
rate for medication errors was noticed. In a considerable fraction of cases, confusion of the order of 
administration of rHuPH20 and Ig 10% appeared to be the problem. Thus, the MAH was requested to 
address this issue and to propose educational materials as additional risk minimization measure in the 
RMP (cf. section Risk management plan below).

PRAC assessor comment: 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 12.0 to address two aspects: 
- 
- 
updates as a result of the recently completed study 161301 (Pregnancy Registry), 
include educational material as additional Risk Minimisation Measures to address an increasing 
number of medication error reports. 
While most changes could be acceptable in general, minor revisions are requested (RSI). 
Study 161301  
Type II group of variations assessment report  
EMA/622537/2021 
Page 17/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Module SVII, the MAH updated the missing information ‘Lack of information on safety in pregnant 
and lactating women’ was updated to ‘Limited information on safety in pregnant and lactating women’ 
due to the completion of study 161301. The statement that “No clinical studies have been done in 
women who are pregnant or breast-feeding” was removed by the MAH. While the limited data available 
does not suggest a different safety profile, the study enrolled so few participants that no reliable 
conclusions can be drawn and this should be stated accordingly in this section. The number of women 
included and the fraction tested for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies should be clearly stated.  
Information on the status of study 161301 was updated; the status was changed to “completed” in the 
pharmacovigilance plan (part III). However, the pharmacovigilance plan lists ongoing and planned 
pharmacovigilance activities and since study 161301 was completed, it should not be included in this 
part of the RMP any longer.  
In annex 2, the subsection “Safety concerns addressed” for study 161301 was changed from “Lack of 
information on safety in pregnant and lactating women” to “Limited information on safety in pregnant 
and lactating women. However, limited information has only been available since study completion and 
the aim of the study was to address the lack of information (…). Thus, this change is not acceptable 
and should be undone. 
Educational material 
In the last PSUR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001633/202005), a high reporting rate for medication errors 
was noticed. In a considerable fraction of cases, confusion of the order of administration of rHuPH20 
and Ig 10% appeared to be the problem. Thus, the MAH was requested to address this issue and 
included educational materials as additional risk minimization measure in RMP part V.  
However, the anticipated target audience(s) is not exactly clear in the currently proposed version. The 
MAH writes: “The target audience is the healthcare providers who prescribe HyQvia. The MAH proposes 
this educational material will be available to users.” Usually, education materials directed towards HCP 
and patients tend to differ. In this particular case, medication error reports necessitate the 
implementation of educational material to highlight the correct sequence of administration of HyQvia to 
patients using it. In addition, HCPs prescribing the product should be made aware of the risk of 
medication errors and the importance to ensure that their patients understand the correct sequence of 
the HyQvia administration. Thus, HCP-directed education material could support HCPs in training 
patients. Moreover, material for patients may help to remember the correct sequence and technique. 
The mentioned website with video material supplemented by leaflets may be suitable although the RMP 
should be revised to make the objectives, target audiences and intended content clearer.  
With regard to the proposed effectiveness evaluation, a detailed review of related reports in the next 
PSUR appears reasonable. Since medication errors represent a potential risk of HyQvia, post-marketing 
data in this respect will be evaluated carefully in general. 
RMP annex 6 was updated to include Details of Proposed Additional Risk Minimization Measures, which 
read as the outline included in part V.2 and contains no additional information. The above comments 
should be considered and in addition it should be expanded to include the statement that prescribes 
will be made aware of the risk of medication errors if the correct sequence of the HyQvia administration 
is not understood.     
Existing guidelines for educational materials (cf. EMA/204715/2012 Rev 2, EMA/61341/2015) should be 
taken into consideration. National requirements regarding the training of patients for self-
administration of parenteral medications may be applicable. HCP and patient educational materials may 
require to be submitted to national regulatory agencies for approval prior to launch. 
The MAH has updated the RMP (version 12.1) accordingly to reflect the suggestion made by the PRAC.

7.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
8.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this group of variations, section 4.6 of the SmPC is being updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) 
is updated accordingly (Section B. Package Leaflet, Point 2). In addition, a series of editorial changes that 
do not change the content of the previously approved SmPC are introduced in sections 3, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.7.  
In view of the very small sample size and fragmentary data, the study report conclusion and the proposed 
changes in the SmPC appear overstated. The statement that the growth and development of infants were 
followed  for  up  to  2  years  post-delivery  is  true  for  one  (1)  child;  even  six  months  after  birth  data  was 
available for less than half of the enrolled infants and only for some parameters. Similarly, the statement 
that no anti-rHuPH20 binding or neutralizing antibodies had developed should include the information that 
only four (4) women were tested for the presence of such antibodies.  
Please refer to Attachment 1, which includes the requested modifications for section 4.6.

Clinical aspects 
RMP aspects 
9.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  The growth of one infant is rather unusual at 12-months and no later follow-up data appears to be 
available. The MAH is asked to summarize all information available on this child, time points of 
product exposure in the mother, and justify that the measurements were stated as normal.    
2.  The MAH is encouraged to investigate participation in registries that aim to assess outcome of drug 
exposure during pregnancy (cf. EUROCAT network). The MAH is kindly asked to comment upon.  
RMP aspects 
3.  The MAH is asked to submit an updated RMP addressing the following issues: 
Type II group of variations assessment report

a.  In Module SVII, it should be stated that while the limited data available does not suggest a 
different safety profile, study 161301 enrolled so few participants that no reliable conclusions 
can be drawn.  
b.  The number of women included in the study and the fraction tested for anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies should be clearly stated.  
c.  The pharmacovigilance plan (RMP part III) lists ongoing and planned pharmacovigilance 
activities and since study 161301 was completed, it should not be included in this part of the 
RMP any longer.  
d.  In annex 2, the change in the subsection “Safety concerns addressed” for study 161301 was 
updated but should represent the original concern addressed at the start of the study and 
should be undone.  
4.  The information on educational material as additional risk minimisation measure should be revised to 
make the objectives, target audiences and intended content clearer (RMP part V.2 and annex 6). 
HCPs prescribing the product need to be made aware of the risk of medication errors and the 
importance to ensure that their patients understand the correct sequence of the HyQvia 
administration and HCP-directed education material could support HCPs in training patients. 
Moreover, material for patients may help to remember the correct sequence and technique. Please 
submit an updated RMP. 
SmPC aspects 
5.  In summary, the limited sample size of the pregnancy registry precludes any scientific robust 
conclusion. The proposed revision of section 4.6 of the SmPC therefore needs to be revised 
substantially.

10.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 The growth of one infant is rather unusual at 12-months and no later follow-up data appears 
to be available. The MAH is asked to summarize all information available on this child, time points of 
product exposure in the mother, and justify that the measurements were stated as normal.    
Summary of the MAH’s response 
One infant’s birthdate was partial in one data field and full in another which caused 
the extreme growth percentile calculation. We updated the SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model) 
to use the full date from the different date field and reprogrammed the impacted listing the extreme 
percentile came from. This infant now has full birth date, which impacts date of 
assessment, age at assessment, and percentiles in the attached corrected L22, L25, and L25_adhoc 
(please refer to pages 5-9 attached to this response document). L25 growth percentiles were 
corrected as the age of infant for follow-up was not 365 days old, but only 97 
days. The values for age-specific growth percentiles have been updated, and the infant should no 
longer be considered as part of 12-month follow-up data. The CSR has not been updated or 
appended. The mother of the infant was enrolled into the Alternative arm of 
the registry on 25-Oct-2016. She was treated with HyQvia between 18-Nov-2015 and 04-Apr-2016. 
The monthly dose of immunoglobulin was 30 g. The date of the last menstruation period was 08- 
Mar-2016. She gave a live birth. The gestational age at birth was 38 weeks. The 
male infant had normal length (48 cm), weight (3.11 kg) and head circumference (34.5 cm) at birth. 
The APGAR scores were 9, 10 and 10 at 1 min, 5 min and 10 min after birth, respectively. The 
infant was enrolled on 07-Feb-2017, a few months after his birth. We have available follow-up data 
on growth and development at 97 and 187 days following his birth . At 97 days old the length (57 cm), 
weight (6.27 kg) and head circumference (38.7 cm) were indicated as normal. No available measurement 
data at 187 days old. However, at both follow-up visits there were no reports of missed 
developmental milestones. The infant was discontinued from the study on 08-Feb-2018. The reason 
for the early termination was subject withdrawal by the parents/legal guardian. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH states that the unusual measurements of the infant were caused by a miscalculation of the 
actual age of the infant at the time of follow up. Instead of 365 days of age, the infant was apparently 
only 97 days old. The MAH did not explain why this deviation was considered “normal” in the original 
report. Furthermore, the MAH states that the infant was born with a normal length (48 cm) and updates 
the date of enrolment/assessment reported in the study report. In addition, the MAH updated also the 
dates of enrolment/assessment for all other infants, which were apparently incorrect in the submitted 
study report. Both data accuracy and presentation could have been improved in the study report. As 
stated earlier, the small sample size of study 161301, incomplete follow-ups and missing data points do 
not allow for drawing any reliable conclusions.  
Question 2 The MAH is encouraged to investigate participation in registries that aim to assess outcome 
of drug exposure during pregnancy (cf. EUROCAT network). The MAH is kindly asked to comment upon.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH is investigating the feasibility of participating in registries that aim to assess outcome of 
drug exposure during pregnancy. As suggested by the PRAC in page 14 of the assessment report, 
the MAH commits to presenting and following up on any cases of drug exposure during pregnancy 
in future PSURs as cases of special interest. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH states that the feasibility of participating in registries that aim to assess outcome of 
drug exposure during pregnancy is investigated. Cases of drug exposure during pregnancy will be 
presented as cases of special interest in future PSURs.

RMP aspects 
Question 3 The MAH is asked to submit an updated RMP addressing the following issues: 
a.  In Module SVII, it should be stated that while the limited data available does not suggest a 
different safety profile, study 161301 enrolled so few participants that no reliable conclusions 
can be drawn.  
b.  The number of women included in the study and the fraction tested for anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies should be clearly stated.  
c.  The pharmacovigilance plan (RMP part III) lists ongoing and planned pharmacovigilance 
activities and since study 161301 was completed, it should not be included in this part of the 
RMP any longer.  
d.  In annex 2, the change in the subsection “Safety concerns addressed” for study 161301 was 
updated but should represent the original concern addressed at the start of the study and 
should be undone.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has updated the RMP (version 12.1) accordingly to reflect the suggestion made by the PRAC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP. In Module SVII, the MAH included the proposed phrasing that no 
reliable conclusions can be drawn from study 161301 due to the small sample size but kept and expanded 
the wording that the study “confirmed no evidence of a different safety profile in pregnant and/or breast-
feeding women”. Please remove this wording within the next RMP revision. In table SIV.2, the MAH newly 
added a statement on median follow-up time of 100 weeks for infants in study 161301. Please remove 
this wording within the next RMP revision as it appears not accurate in view of incomplete and 
fragmented data (cf. comment to question 5 below). 
Issue considered resolved for now. 
Question 4  The information on educational material as additional risk minimisation measure should be 
revised to make the objectives, target audiences and intended content clearer (RMP part V.2 and annex 
6). HCPs prescribing the product need to be made aware of the risk of medication errors and the 
importance to ensure that their patients understand the correct sequence of the HyQvia administration 
and HCP-directed education material could support HCPs in training patients. Moreover, material for 
patients may help to remember the correct sequence and technique. Please submit an updated RMP. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has updated the RMP (version 12.1) accordingly to reflect the suggestion made by the 
PRAC of clarifying objectives, target audience, and intended content of the educational materials. 
As originally suggested by the MAH in the RMP and also agreed by the PRAC, a detailed review 
of related reports will be done with the next PSUR with regards to the proposed effectiveness 
evaluation.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has updated the RMP and clarified objectives and target audiences of the educational materials. 
Issue resolved.

SmPC aspects 
Question 5 In summary, the limited sample size of the pregnancy registry precludes any scientific robust 
conclusion. The proposed revision of section 4.6 of the SmPC therefore needs to be revised substantially. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Please refer to the updated Product Information under section 1.3.1 and as tracked Word file in 
the working folder. 
In accordance with the PRAC recommendation the update of section 4.6 of the SmPC has been 
shortened. Additional information on the pregnancy outcomes has been added because Takeda 
believes those data are one of the most relevant information from the registry which can help 
clinicians and patients to make informed decisions regarding the use of HyQvia during pregnancy. 
The median follow-up time from enrollment in infants has been added to the text. The calculation 
of the infants’ median follow-up time has been attached to this response document (Listing # 1, 
attached to this response document, page 10). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH submitted a revised Product Information and introduced most requested changes as well as 
information on pregnancy outcomes, which is acceptable. However, the statement that the growth and 
development of infants were followed for up to 2 years post-delivery was not removed as requested but 
only rephrased with the same meaning (infants were followed for a median of 100 weeks). As indicated 
previously, this appears not acceptable in view of the incomplete and fragmented data, which does not 
allow for drawing conclusions on the physical and neurological development of infants post maternal 
HyQvia exposure during pregnancy. For example, at the 12-month follow-up, weight, length and head 
circumference information was available in 2 infants, and included in the 12-month follow-up due to a 
data base error (cf. question 1). At 18-months follow-up, this information was available in 1 infant, and at 
24-months again for only 1 infant. In line with this, the median follow-up duration based on available 
information on length and weight would be 97 days instead of almost 2 years. In conclusion, the sentence 
“A total of 7 infants were enrolled in this study and followed for a median of 100 weeks.” should be 
deleted entirely from the SmPC section 4.6.  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
11.  List of outstanding issues 
1.  The proposed update of the SmPC section 4.6 does not at all reflect the incomplete and fragmented 
follow up data of study 161301 with regard to the infants and is not considered acceptable (cf. 
comment to question/response 5). Therefore, the sentence “A total of 7 infants were enrolled in this 
study and followed for a median of 100 weeks.” in section 4.6 should be deleted from the SmPC. 
Please submit the updated SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In accordance with PRAC recommendation, the sentence has been deleted.

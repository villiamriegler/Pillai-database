Vocabria (cabotegravir) 
An overview of Vocabria and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is Vocabria and what is it used for? 
Vocabria is used together with another medicine called rilpivirine to treat adults infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS). It is used in adults whose infection is under control with antiretroviral medicines (medicines for 
HIV). 
Vocabria contains the active substance cabotegravir. 
How is Vocabria used? 
Vocabria is available as tablets to be taken by mouth and as a prolonged-release suspension for 
injection. ‘Prolonged release’ means that the active substance is released slowly over a few weeks after 
being injected. The injection is given into the hip or buttock muscle by a doctor or nurse.  
Before starting treatment, the doctor ensures that the patient agrees to keep to the schedule of 
injections because this is important to keep the virus under control and there is a risk that levels of the 
virus could increase or the virus could become resistant to treatment if doses are missed. 
Cabotegravir and rilpivirine tablets are taken daily by mouth for one month, after which Vocabria and 
rilpivirine injections are given monthly or every 2 months.  
If treatment with Vocabria is stopped, another treatment to supress the virus must be started to 
minimise the risk that the virus could become resistant to treatment.  
Vocabria can only be obtained with a prescription and should be prescribed by a doctor who has 
experience in the management of HIV infection.  
For more information about using Vocabria, including the schedule for the injections, see the package 
leaflet or contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
How does Vocabria work? 
Vocabria is an integrase inhibitor. This is a medicine that blocks an enzyme called integrase that the 
virus needs to make new copies of itself in the body. By blocking this enzyme, Vocabria, taken 
together with rilpivirine, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level. Vocabria

does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it can hold off damage to the immune system and the 
development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS. 
What benefits of Vocabria have been shown in studies? 
Vocabria, taken together with rilpivirine, was as effective as other HIV medicines in maintaining HIV-1 
level in the blood (viral load) below a defined level (less than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) in 3 main 
studies involving patients with HIV-1 infection. The studies involved patients who had not taken HIV 
medicines before or who had been taking these medicines for at least 6 months. 
In two studies, patients were treated with Vocabria and rilpivirine or with combinations of other 
medicines. After 48 weeks, the HIV-1 level was above the limit in 1.9% of patients (11 out of 591) 
taking monthly injections of Vocabria and rilpivirine and in 1.7% of patients (10 out of 591) taking 
other medicines.  
One study showed that injections of Vocabria and rilpivirine given monthly or every 2 months were 
similarly effective. After 48 weeks for patients taking the injections every 2 months, the HIV-1 level 
was above the limit in 1.7% of patients (9 out of 522) compared with 1% of patients (5 out of 523) 
who had monthly injections. 
What are the risks associated with Vocabria? 
The most common side effects with Vocabria (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are injection 
site reactions, headache and fever. 
Vocabria must not be used with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines 
for epilepsy) or with rifampicin, rifapentine (antibiotics), as these medicines may lead to reduced blood 
levels of the medicine, reducing its effectiveness. 
For the full list of side effects and restrictions with Vocabria, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Vocabria authorised in the EU? 
Vocabria injections monthly or every 2 months may be more convenient for patients than taking 
medicines every day. Studies showed that the medicine was as effective at keeping the virus level low 
as other standard medicines. It is important that patients keep to the schedule of injections to avoid 
the virus becoming resistant to treatment, and further studies will determine whether this is happening 
once the medicine is on the market. The European Medicines Agency decided that Vocabria’s benefits 
are greater than its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Vocabria? 
The company that markets Vocabria will carry out 2 studies on how the medicine is used and its 
effectiveness. The outcomes for patients who switch to other treatments after taking Vocabria will also 
be studied. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Vocabria have also been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Vocabria are continuously monitored. Side effects reported with 
Vocabria are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted on 30 November 2016 a group of variation(s) consisting of an extension of 
the marketing authorisation and the following variation(s): 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for the addition of two new strengths (10 mg and 30 mg) of the long acting intramuscular 
powder and solvent for suspension for injection pharmaceutical form. 
In addition, the MAH proposed a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to extend the indication to include ‘Treatment of adult 
patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed’ to the 
intramuscular injection formulations. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Signifor, was designated as an orphan medicinal product (EU/3/09/671) on 08 October 2009 in the following 
condition: Treatment of Cushing’s disease.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan designation. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/75/2009 on 
the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The new claimed therapeutic indication for the long-acting intramuscular (i.m.) formulation of Signifor is: 
“Treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has 
failed.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Cushing’s disease is a very rare, debilitating, and life-threatening disease. The prevalence of Cushing’s disease 
is 0.4 per 10000 individuals in the EU. The disease is 3.5 times more frequent in women than men, and it is 
usually diagnosed in patients 25 to 45 years of age. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Cushing’s disease is caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma. The 
tumours are usually microadenomas (≤1 cm in diameter); macroadenomas are rare. The elevated levels of 
ACTH stimulate the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol, thereby leading to the subsequent development 
of the clinical signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The disease is characterised by the development of the clinical signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism. The 
normal circadian rhythm of cortisol production is usually lost. Most patients are obese or overweight, with 
abdominal visceral adiposity and facial fullness (moon face). More than 70% have hypertension, around 80% 
have impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (often due to insulin resistance), and dyslipidaemia is seen in 
around 20% of patients. Changes in physical appearance commonly include hirsutism, thinning of skin with easy 
bruising, purplish striae, reddening of the cheeks, and ulceration of the skin. Hypercortisolism is also associated 
with muscular atrophy, generalized weakness and fatigue, osteopenia/osteoporosis, menstrual disorders in 
women, decreased fertility and/or libido, and immune deficiency with an increased risk for infections. In 
addition, patients with large pituitary tumours may have evidence of mass effect, including headache or visual 
impairment as a result of impingement on the optic apparatus. 
The physiological and physical changes resulting from chronic hypercortisolism have significant impact on the 
patients' quality of life: many patients suffer from depression, emotional instability, and sleeping difficulties, 
80% of patients report interference with family life and relations with their partner, and more than half with 
school or work performance. 
Patients with Cushing's disease have increased morbidity and a mortality rate 4 times higher than age- and 
gender-matched subjects. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Pituitary resection of the adenoma is the current first-line therapy for Cushing’s disease, but surgical failure 
rates range between 8 to 31% even in the hands of the most experienced neurosurgeons, and post-operative 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 9/78 
  
  
recurrence rates are between 5 and 34%. Repeat pituitary surgery may be undertaken if disease persists after 
initial surgery, although there is an overall lower rate of success than that seen after the first operation. 
For patients not cured by pituitary surgery (either 1 or multiple attempts), irradiation (fractionated external 
beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) of the pituitary or bilateral adrenalectomy are the remaining 
non-medical treatment options. 
Available medical options generally fill a short-term, palliative role and are rarely used alone as long-term 
therapy. Currently ketoconazole is approved for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome which includes a number 
of conditions with increased cortisol production, including Cushing’s disease. Ketoconazole is an 
11β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase inhibitor, which leads to a decrease in cortisol production. The initial 
efficacy with ketoconazole (normalization of UFC) is up to 81% of patients with Cushing’s disease, but escape is 
possible requiring continued dose escalation with an increased risk of side effects. 
Other available pharmacological treatments are metyrapone and mitotane which like ketoconazole inhibit 
cortisol production. Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid that appears to inhibit glucocorticoid receptor activation. 
Cabergoline, which is a dopamine receptor agonist has also been used, since some corticotroph pituitary 
adenomas express dopamine receptors. There is however only 1 prospective study on the use of cabergoline as 
monotherapy. 
None of the available pharmacological treatment options listed, apart from cabergoline, targets the cause of the 
disease, i.e. the pituitary adenoma. Thus there is an unmet medical need in the treatment of patients with 
Cushing’s disease.  
Pasireotide, in the short-acting formulation for subcutaneous use, has already been shown to be effective in the 
treatment of Cushing’s disease  and limited data indicate that pasireotide not only lowers cortisol production but 
also result in a decrease in pituitary tumour volume. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Pasireotide is a cyclohexapeptide analog of the natural hormone somatostatin. Pasireotide was first developed 
as an immediate release formulation for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The pasireotide s.c. formulation was first 
approved for the treatment of hypercortisolism in Cushing’s disease in 2012.  
A long-acting release formulation (“pasireotide longacting”; “pasireotide LAR”) for intramuscular (i.m.) 
injections was developed to improve the convenience of administration by reducing the number of injections 
from twice a day to once a month. The pasireotide long-acting formulation was first approved for the treatment 
of acromegaly. 
2.1.7.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
There are no specific regulatory guidelines for the development of medicinal products intended to treat 
Cushing’s disease. The design of the Phase 3 study supporting this application reflects current scientific and 
clinical knowledge.  
In the EU, Scientific Advice was sought on the development program for the pasireotide long-acting formulation 
in Cushing’s disease. The CHMP considered the study design, which mimics that of Study B2305, acceptable 
(EMA Scientific Advice 2008). The Applicant incorporated the suggestion to evaluate a high and a low dose of the 
long-acting formulation versus the initially proposed doses of 40 mg and 60 mg to offset the lack of a control arm 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017

in the trial. In addition, following Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur feedback received in July 2015 in response to the 
communication regarding the error in the methodology of determination of the UFC reference range at the 
central lab, the statistical analysis plan was revised to include analyses that evaluated the impact of the new ULN 
on study conduct (enrolment, dose up-titration) and response rates.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder and solvent for suspension for injection containing 10 and 30 mg of 
pasireotide pamoate as active substance.  
Other ingredients are poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (50-60:40-50) and Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (50:50) 
in the powder; and carmellose sodium, mannitol, poloxamer 188 and water for injections in the solvent, as 
described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The finished product is available in a brownish glass vial with chlorobutyl rubber stopper containing the powder, 
and a colourless glass pre-filled syringe containing the solvent, packaged together with a vial adapter and a 
safety injection needle as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used in the manufacture of the proposed Signifor 10 mg and 30 mg powder and solvent for 
suspension for injection is the same as that being used for the already approved Signifor 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 
mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection strengths. No new information on the active substance has 
been provided within this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as powder and solvent for suspension for injection. The formulation is a long 
acting  release  (LAR)  dosage  form  for  parenteral  (intramuscular)  administration.  It  consists  of  pasireotide 
pamoate loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles which should be suspended in an aqueous vehicle 
prior to injection. The lyophilised powder is a slightly yellowish to yellowish powder packaged in a 6 ml glass vial. 
The solvent (solution composed of commonly used excipients and water for injections) is a 2 ml clear, colourless 
to slightly yellow or slightly brown solution filled into 3 ml prefilled syringes.  The solvent for these two new 
strengths  is  the  same  used  in  the  already  authorised  strengths.  No  further  information  regarding  the 
manufacture, specifications and stability has been presented in the context of this line extension application. 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop two new dosage strengths, namely 10 and 30 
mg, of Signifor powder and solvent for suspension for intramuscular (im) injection to support the extension of 
indication for Cushing’s disease, in addition to the already approved 20 mg and 40 mg strengths. 
The two new strengths were developed with the same long release formulation, employing microencapsulation 
of the active substance in biodegradable polymers, as the currently approved strengths, for administration once 
a month. The active substance is uniformly distributed within the microparticles from which the active substance 
is continuously released (primarily by diffusion and hydrolysis/erosion).

EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 11/78 
  
  
 
The formulation development and manufacturing process for pasireotide pamoate powder for suspension for 
injection,  as  well  as  the  pharmaceutical  development  for  the  vehicle  and  the  devices  was  established  and 
presented during the original submission of the current approved strengths of 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg. 
The 10 mg and 30 mg strengths are derived from the same bulk powder as the marketed strengths. They only 
differ in the fill weight and the colour of the flip-off cap. Therefore, the pharmaceutical development information 
of  the  already  approved  strengths  (including  pasireotide  salt  selection  studies,  excipient  selection  and 
compatibility studies, design of the microparticles manufacturing process and pharmacokinetic profile studies 
for  different  formulation  variants)  is  applicable  to  all  developed  dosage  strengths.  Several  process 
improvements  were  conducted  to  optimize  the  filling  accuracy  and  robustness  for  the  10  mg  strength.  The 
successful implementation of the adaptations was proved during process validation.  
The  composition  and  configuration  of  clinical  batches  has  been  presented.  The  switch  from  the  clinical 
presentation  to  commercial  presentation  was  supported  by  comparative  analytical  data  on  ‘uniformity  of 
delivered dose’. In summary all data for the clinical as well as the commercial presentation comply with the 
specifications criteria and the specified limits. Each vial contains a justified overfill which allows removal of the 
labelled content from the vial. 
The  same  terminal  sterilization  method  by  gamma  irradiation  is  used  for  all  the  strengths.  Therefore,  no 
additional information has been provided for the 10 mg and 30 mg dosage strengths. 
The excipients used for the new strengths are the same as those employed for the currently approved strengths. 
They are all well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
The primary packaging for pasireotide pamoate powder for suspension for injection 10 mg and 30 mg is the 
same as for the already approved strengths. It consists of colourless 6 ml glass vials (Type I glass) complying 
with the requirements of Ph. Eur. and USP, closed with a grey rubber stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and covered 
with a coloured flip-off cap (aluminum/polypropylene). The cap does not come into contact with the finished 
product. Due to the final gamma irradiation process a slight change in the vial’s appearance from colourless to 
brownish occurs, which was not a new finding. It was also observed with the already approved strengths and has 
no impact on the chemical and physical properties of the glass (except colour and light transmission). The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for  Signifor 10 mg and  30 mg powder for suspension for injection is a standard 
process for parenteral formulations which comprises the following main steps: preparation of the organic and 
the  aqueous  phases  separately;  preparation  of  microparticules;  washing,  drying  and  sieving  of  the 
microparticules; filling and stoppering of the vials and terminal sterilization by gamma-irradiation. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  described  in  sufficient  detail.  The  manufacturing  process  for  the  bulk 
powder and the gamma irradiation sterilization process is the same for all dosage strengths and it is covered by 
the  process  validation  performed  for  the  manufacture  of  the  already  approved  20  mg,  40  mg  and  60  mg 
strengths. 
As the powder for suspension for injection for the 10 mg and 30 mg strengths is derived from the same bulk 
powder as the marketed strengths and the new dosage strengths only differ from those already approved in the 
fill weight and colour of the flip-off cap, the manufacturing process development and validation of the process for 
these new strengths were focused on the filling process. The validation of the manufacturing process for the bulk 
powder  and  the  terminal  sterilization  process  is  covered  by  the  process  validation  performed  for  the 
manufacture of the commercial 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg strengths. The filling step of the process for the 10 mg 
and 30 mg powder for suspension for injection has been validated using three full-scale production batches of 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 12/78 
  
  
each strength. Details on the process validation for the filling of the bulk material into vials for the 10 mg and 30 
mg strength have been provided and fully meet the specifications. 
The  critical  steps,  which  have  been  defined  and  are  controlled  by  in-process  controls  (IPCs),  have  been 
adequately justified. The overall control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a 
product that meets the defined criteria for all release specifications.  
A holding time for the intermediate has been established and the compatibility of its packaging material has 
been demonstrated by stability studies. 
In conclusion, based on process validation data and adequacy of in-process controls, it is considered that the 
manufacturing process of the finished product (pasireotide powder and solvent for suspension for injection, 10 
mg, and 30 mg) is sufficiently robust to provide assurance of consistent quality, complying with the proposed 
specification.

Adequate specifications for control of the finished product at release and during shelf-life have been established. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH 
guidelines. These are the same used for the already approved strengths (20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg). Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards has been presented.  
Appropriate  data  have  been  presented  to  justify  the  specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is 
controlled. The specifications established for control ensure the identity, safety, and purity of the 10 mg and 30 
mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection, throughout the proposed finished product shelf life. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  from  six  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  10  mg  strength  and  three 
commercial scale batches for the 30 mg s strength, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and 
its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product  specification.  All  results  comply  with  the  proposed 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of the 10 mg strength stored under long term conditions at 5ºC 
(inverse and upright storage)/ambient RH for 60 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
25ºC (inverse storage)/60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Signifor 10 mg 
are representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
For the 30 mg strength, a bracketing approach was followed and the registration stability study provided for the 
commercialized strengths (i.e. 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg) was used. This is in line with ICH requirements, as the 
different dosage strengths are obtained by filling different amounts of microparticles (powder for suspension for 
injection) into glass vials of the same size and they only differ in the fill weight. 
The stability parameters studied were assay, degradation products, appearance of the contents, appearance of 
the constituted suspension, pH value of the constituted suspension, particle size distribution, molecular mass of 
the polymer, suspendability, drug burst, drug release, water content and microbial tests. The methods used 
were the same as those for release and are stability indicating. 
All the results from the long term stability study were within the proposed specifications limits. Although some 
out of specification results were observed they have been attributed to laboratory errors and not to product 
failure. No difference was observed between inverted and upright storage. Overall the data demonstrate good 
product stability profile at 5°C/ambient RH. 
Under accelerated condition, all chemical and physical data met specification limits except for one result for 
water content after 3 months of storage in inverted position. After 6 months storage, the water content was 
within the specifications, but showing variability. In addition, a slight trend for total of degradation products, 
drug burst and water content towards increasing values was observed. 
Additional stability testing was performed on one commercial scale batch stored for up to 6 months at -20°C 
(inverse storage)/ambient RH and three commercial scale 10 mg stored for up to 6 months at 30°C (inverse 
storage)/75% RH. All the data generated met specifications in both conditions except the water content after 3 
and 6 month under the 30°C/75% RH storage conditions that exceed the specification limit. Additionally, stress 
studies were carried out at freeze and thaw conditions and included a photostability test, which was carried in 
one commercial batch in accordance with the ICH Q1B guideline. The results show that the finished product is 
not sensitive to low temperatures and neither to light.

The stability of the reconstituted suspension was studied on two pilot scale batches after storage of the powder 
at 5°C/ambient RH for up to 60 months. Following reconstitution, the suspension was kept for 3 hours at room 
temperature  and  analysed.  The  data  generated  showed  that  the  suspension  is  stable  over  the  investigated 
period  and  supports  the  SmPC  instruction  in  section  4.2  “Signifor  suspension  must  only  be  prepared 
immediately before administration”. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2°C to 8°C as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin have been used in the manufacture of the finished product Signifor 10 
mg and 30 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No new information on the active substance has been provided within this line extension application.  
The development of the 10 mg and 30 mg strengths was based on the already authorised Signifor 20 mg, 40 mg 
and 60 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection. The solvent for these two new strengths is the same 
used in the already authorised strengths. No further information regarding the manufacture, specifications and 
stability of the solvent has been presented. All strengths are prepared from the same bulk powder. They only 
differ in fill weight and flip-off cap. Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of test carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
None.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  non-clinical  documentation  was  provided  by  the  Applicant.    Both  the  indication  and  the  formulation  are 
already approved in the EU for Signifor. This line extension adds two product strengths (10mg and 30mg) to the 
currently approved product strengths (20mg, 40mg and 60mg), and extends the treatment of the currently 
approved Cushing’s disease indication to a once-monthly formulation. No additional non-clinical data has been 
generated, as all relevant non-clinical aspects have already been addressed in the original submission (for the 
indication) and the previous line extension procedure X-10 (for the formulation). This is acceptable.  
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 15/78 
  
  
According to the guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), an environmental risk assessment (ERA) should be prepared if there is an 
increase in the environmental exposure. Since the use of the once-monthly intramuscular formulation in 
Cushing’s disease (maximum dose 40mg q28d, i.e. 1.43 mg/day) will target the same indication and population 
as the currently approved subcutaneous formulation (maximum dose in Cushing’s disease: 900mcg bid, i.e. 1.8 
mg/day), no increase in environmental exposure relative to the originally submitted ERA for pasireotide 
diaspartate and pasireotide pamoate is anticipated. Therefore, no new ERA has been submitted. This is 
acceptable.  
2.3.2.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There is no objection to an approval of Signifor from a non-clinical point of view.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

The current submission of pasireotide LAR 10 and 30 mg is primarily based on one pivotal phase 3 study. 
Supportive data from earlier studies following sc administration for treatment of Cushing’s disease and im 
injection in treatment of patients with acromegaly are also included (Table 1).

The Applicant has aimed to achieve similar steady-state exposure after administration of the two starting doses  
in study G2304 of 10 and 30 mg LAR administered once every 4 weeks as for 300 and 900 µg bid administration 
of the sc formulation. A similar exposure would allow the extrapolation of data regarding e.g. special populations 
and drug-drug interactions from the already approved formulations of Signifor. 
Pharmacokinetic data 
Sparse PK blood samples were taken in the pivotal phase 3 study G2304. PK-samples were taken at the following 
time points: one blood sample at pre-dose with respect to the LAR intra-muscular injection for each treatment 
cycle as Ctrough, one blood sample at Day 22 of Month 0, 3 and 6 as Cmax and one blood sample at the end of 
study treatment as Ctrough. Plasma concentrations of pasireotide were determined with a validated 
radioimmunoassay (RIA).  
Populations Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis was undertaken using NONMEM. Development of a base model, 
i.e., a model without covariates, began with a model previously developed for pasireotide LAR in healthy 
volunteers and acromegaly patients that accounted for the multiphasic release of pasireotide from the LAR 
formulation. Sparse sampling could not support estimation of the model’s full set of parameters, therefore, 
absorption parameters were held fixed at their estimates from the previous modeling.   
No new information on absorption can be derived from the model and the information on Cmax from is limited. 
The model’s value mainly is to describe the Ctrough values and the model appears adequate for this purpose. 
Results 
The Ctrough of pasireotide reached an approximately PK steady state after 3 consecutive monthly doses of 
pasireotide LAR 5 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg in this Cushing's disease patient population, see Table 2 below.

Table 2. Summary of pasireotide Ctrough up to Month 12 by incident doses in study 
G2304 (PAS). 
The mean Ctrough,ss of 30 mg pasireotide long-acting formulation observed in Study G2304 was 7.88 to 9.34 
ng/mL, and it is comparable with the Ctrough,ss of 8.50 ng/mL observed at 900 μg sc bid dose, which was shown 
to be effective in the Study B2305. The mean Ctrough,ss of the 40 mg pasireotide long-acting formulation 
observed in Study G2304 was 10.7 to 12.6 ng/mL, and it is higher than the Ctrough,ss observed at 900 μg sc bid 
dose in the Study B2305. The 10 mg pasireotide yielded a mean Ctrough,ss of 2.40 to 3.36 ng/mL in Study 
G2304, and it is comparable with 2.80 ng/mL of Ctrough,ss predicted with the 300 μg sc bid dose and with the 
observed value (ranged from 1.5 to 6.1 ng/mL) from Study B2305 which was shown to maintain response when 
patients were down-titrated from 600 μg. 
The observed mean Cmax at 30 mg ranged from 8.20 to 10.0 ng/mL and the mean Cmax at 40 mg was 12.1 
ng/mL, all of which are below the predicted Cmax of 38.5 ng/mL for 600 μg in Cushing patients and observed 
Cmax of 24.3 ng/mL for 600 μg sc bid dose. 
The estimated values of apparent clearance (CL/F) of pasireotide long-acting for typical patients (Cushing 
disease and acromegaly) and healthy volunteers (based on results from PopPK analysis), are presented in Table 
3.

Table 3. Estimated CL/F (L/h) for pasireotide LAR in typical patients and healthy 
volunteers. 
Dose-proportionality was explored for Ctrough,ss (defined as those after the third injection) and Cmax,ss (i.e. 
C22) of pasireotide by fitting a power model. The point estimate for the slope in dose proportionality analysis 
was 1.13 (90% CI: 1.08, 1.19) for Ctrough,ss and 0.97 (90% CI: 0.88, 1.06) for Cmax,ss of doses 10 mg to 40 
mg. 
Special populations 
No new data have been submitted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Dosage recommendations are 
based on previous data obtained with pasireotide sc. Gender, race, weight or age were not found to be clinical 
significant covariates in the popPK model. 
Interactions 
No additional data were generated for this submission. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PK/PD analyses evaluated the relationship between pasireotide exposure and response in terms of clinical 
efficacy and safety in Study G2304. 
Mechanism of action 
Pasireotide (SOM230), is an injectable cyclohexapeptide analog of natural somatostatin and exerts its 
pharmacological activity via binding to somatostatin receptors subtypes (SSTR) similar to natural somatostatin 
and other somatostatin analogs. Five human somatostatin receptor subtypes are known: SSTR 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
Pasireotide binds with high affinity to four of the five SSTRs (SSTR 1, 2, 3 and 5). 
Due to its broad binding profile to somatostatin receptors, pasireotide has the potential to treat diseases 
characterized by expression of those receptors in the target tissues,such as Cushing’sdisease. 
Primary pharmacology 
No new data on the pharmacodynamic effect of pasireotide in Cushing’s disease have been provided. This is 
acceptable considering that pasireotide has already been shown to have an effect on the disease when used as 
subcutaneous injection. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Hyperglycaemia 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 19/78 
  
  
 
The relationship between PK and hyperglycaemia was assessed in several ways. Overall, there was a positive 
association between Ctrough,ss and increased probability of developing hyperglycaemia seen across all analyses as 
exemplified in Figure 2. The risk of developing hyperglycaemia was higher among patients with pre-existing 
disturbance in glucose metabolism at baseline (i.e. pre-diabetic and diabetic patients). 
Figure 1 Repeated measures generalized linear model: pasireotide Ctrough,ss vs. probability of 
hyperglycaemia (defined as FPG change from baseline greater than 36 mg/dL) - data up to Month 4 
(PAS) 
Cardiac safety: QT intervals 
Linear mixed effect model analyses of pasireotide concentration and change from baseline for both QTcF and 
QTcB suggested a flat, clinically non-significant relationship between pasireotide concentration and change from 
baseline for both QTcF and QTcB. 
Liver safety: hepatic safety parameters 
The estimated effect of pasireotide concentration on the hepatic safety parameters aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) and albumin was investigated based on linear mixed effects models of log-transformed 
pasireotide concentrations vs. log-transformed laboratory parameters. No clinically significant effects were 
found between pasireotide concentration and hepatic safety parameters. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
No data on pharmacodynamic interactions have been provided. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The results from two different PK/PD modeling approaches (logistic regression and Emax modeling) were 
consistent, and demonstrated a positive correlation between pasireotide exposure and mUFC response ((i.e. 
mUFC ≤1.0xULN), and the effect of covariate on the exposure/response relationship). Specifically, the results

EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 20/78 
  
  
 
from the logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of an mUFC response increased by an estimated 18% 
for a 3-fold increase in pasireotide Ctrough,ss (corresponding to a pasireotide dose increased from 10 mg to 
30 mg)(Figure 3).

probability of mUFC response in Study G2304 - data up to Month 4 (PAS) 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of pasireotide has previously been investigated in healthy volunteers (sc formulation and 
LAR), in Cushing’s patients (sc formulation) and in acromegaly patients (LAR formulation). 
In the current application for two new strengths of pasireotide LAR, 10 mg and 30 mg, pharmacokinetic data has 
been obtained from sparse sampling in the pivotal phase 3 study in patients with Cushing’s disease. This is 
sufficient given the previous knowledge of the active substance.  
The main pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were Ctrough and plasma concentration at day 22 of months 
0, 3 and 6 (C22) which was used as a surrogate for Cmax. Given the large inter-individual variability in the shape 
of the plasma concentration time profiles previously observed with the LAR formulation, C22 may however not 
be the true Cmax in all individuals. 
Approximate dose-proportionality within the range 10 to 60 mg following single-doses in healthy volunteers has 
previously been established. In addition, dose-proportionality at steady-state in patients with Cushing’s disease 
was evaluated using sparse sampling in study G2304. Although the results indicate dose-proportionality 
between 10 and 40 mg for Ctrough,ss and C22,ss  the results should be interpreted with caution since the study 
was not powered to evaluate dose-proportionality.  
Mean Ctrough values at steady-state obtained after administration of pasireotide LAR 10-30 mg q4w (study 
G2304) was approximately comparable to Ctrough,ss obtained after therapeutic doses of pasireotide sc 300-900 
µg b.i.d. (study B2305). The 40 mg dose resulted in approximately 30% higher Ctrough concentrations than 
with the highest recommended sc dose of 900 µg. Since safety has been sufficiently demonstrated for doses up 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 21/78 
  
  
 
to 40 mg in the pivotal phase 3 study, this is not a concern.  The highest pasireotide LAR dose of 40 mg q4w 
resulted in C22,ss values which were well below those obtained with 600 µg b.i.d. sc dosing. Even though the 
use of C22 as a surrogate for Cmax is uncertain, the safety margin between the suggested LAR Cmax and sc 
Cmax is relatively large. Taken together, the overall plasma exposure at steady state of pasireotide LAR 10-40 
mg appears to be approximately comparable to the exposure obtained after therapeutic doses of pasireotide sc. 
Thus, previous conclusions regarding special populations and drug-drug interactions, from pasireotide sc and 
pasireotide LAR (acromegaly indication), can be extrapolated to the use of pasireotide LAR in patients with 
Cushing’s disease.  
Pharmacodynamics 
No new data on the pharmacodynamic effect of pasireotide in Cushing’s disease have been provided. This is 
acceptable considering that pasireotide has already been shown to have an effect on the disease when used as 
subcutaneous injection. 
PK/PD analyses evaluated the relationship between pasireotide exposure and response in terms of clinical 
efficacy and safety in Study G2304. The data provided indicate a positive exposure/”response” relationship with 
regards to the risk of developing hyperglycaemia. Notably, pre-existing disturbances in glucose metabolism is 
an important risk factor for the development of hyperglycaemia. No such correlation with exposure was 
observed for the risk of QT-prolongation or increases in liver enzymes at the doses investigated.  
No data on pharmacodynamic interactions have been provided. Adequate information on pharmacodynamic 
interactions is included in the SmPC, section 4.5 which is based on the knowledge of the pharmacodynamic 
effects of pasireotide in combination with the clinical experience in the treatment of both Cushing’s disease and 
acromegaly. 
A positive correlation between pasireotide exposure and mUFC response could be demonstrated although the 
curve is rather flat in the dose range 10 to 30 mg. The odds of mUFC response increased by an estimated 18% 
whereas the odds of developing hyperglycaemia doubled in this dose range. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics has been sufficiently characterised. 
The pharmacodynamics of pasireotide has been well characterised.  
2.4.6.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Dose selection 
No dedicated dose-response study was performed. The selection of the two starting doses of pasireotide (10 mg 
and 30 mg) was based on the following. 
The selection of the 30 mg pasireotide dose was guided by PK/PD modelling, which predicted that the Ctrough at 
steady-state (Ctrough,ss) would be 10.6 ng/mL in patients with Cushing’s disease; this value is slightly higher than 
the Ctrough,ss observed clinically with the 900 μg sc bid dose (8.5 ng/mL), which was shown to be effective in 
Study B2305. The predicted Cavg,ss and AUC0-d28,ss of the 30 mg dose were close to the predicted values of the 
900 μg sc bid dose in Study B2305. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 22/78 
  
  
The 10 mg pasireotide dose was chosen based on the Ctrough,ss of 3.5 ng/mL predicted by PK/PD modelling, which 
was slightly higher than the 2.8 ng/mL Ctrough,ss observed with the 300 μg sc bid dose in Study B2305. AUCss and 
Cavg,ss of the 10 mg dose were also close to the corresponding parameters for 300 μg sc bid. The 10 mg dose was 
expected to offer a better benefit-risk balance in patients with low baseline mUFC; furthermore, the 10 mg dose 
would allow for a broader dose range together with the 30 mg dose. 
Patients whose mUFC was >1.5xULN were up-titrated at month 4 (i.e. at the time steady-state was achieved), 
unless precluded by safety concerns. Similarly, those randomized to 10 mg were up-titrated to 30 mg, and those 
randomized to 30 mg were up-titrated to 40 mg, unless precluded by safety concerns. The steady states of AUC, 
Cavg, and Ctrough predicted for the 40 mg dose were slightly higher than for the 900 μg bid sc dose in Study 
B2305, and the predicted steady state Cmax was comparable to the 600 μg bid sc dose. Therefore, the 40 mg 
dose was considered an appropriate alternative for patients who did not respond to the 30 mg dose. 
In Study G2304, a patient’s dose could be decreased to a minimum of 5 mg pasireotide in case of tolerability 
issues. 
Considering also the options for dose up-titration and down-titration, the full range of dose levels used in the 
study was 5 mg to 40 mg, with 10 mg and 30 mg being the starting doses in the study. 
Main studies 
The efficacy evaluation for this submission is based on the registration Study G2304 (pasireotide long-acting in 
Cushing’s disease). This submission includes data collected up to the cut-off date of 10-Nov-2015, at which time 
all patients had completed the 12-month Core phase, or discontinued. The study is currently ongoing. 
The efficacy of pasireotide in the treatment of Cushing’s disease was first established in Study B2305 using the 
pasireotide s.c. formulation. Data from Study B2305 (including updated long-term data) are also briefly 
presented in this report to further support the efficacy of pasireotide in Cushing’s disease. The original 
submission for pasireotide sc in Cushing’s disease included all data from this study collected up to the cut-off 
date of 17-Mar-2010, at which time all patients had completed the 12-month core phase or discontinued. The 
study has now been completed. 
Methods 
Study G2304 
This was a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study of pasireotide 10 mg and 30 mg in patients with Cushing’s 
disease, consisting of a 12-month core phase and an open-ended, optional extension. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 23/78 
  
  
Figure 3 Core phase design scheme 
Extension phase 
After completing the 12-month core phase, patients had the option to continue study treatment in the extension 
phase, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
the patient achieved/maintained mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN at Month 12, or if the patient did not 
achieve/maintain mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN at Month 12, but received significant clinical benefit in the opinion of 
the Investigator. 
the patient showed acceptable tolerability to pasireotide LAR treatment 
With the implementation of Amendment 5, patients who continued to receive clinical benefit, as assessed by the 
investigator, could continue in the study after Month 24 (i.e. 12 months of core, and 12 months of extension 
treatment).  
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
A confirmed diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing’s disease was required. Male and female patients aged 18 
years or older, with persistent or recurrent disease, or de novo patients who were not considered candidates for 
pituitary surgery, were eligible for the study. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 24/78 
  
  
 
The following criteria for diagnosis were applied (all three bullet points had to be fulfilled): 
• 
The mean of three 24-hour urine samples collected within two weeks ≥ 1.5xULN and ≤ 5xULN (as 
determined by the central lab of this study) 
•  Morning plasma ACTH within the normal or above normal range 
•  Confirmation of pituitary origin of excess ACTH by at least one of the following three: 
a.  History of MRI confirmation of pituitary adenoma (greater than 6 mm) with positive dynamic test 
(e.g. CRH or high dose dexamethasone suppression test) 
Or 
Or 
b.  History of inferior petrosal sinus sampling in patients with a tumour less or equal than 6 mm that 
met any of the following criteria with either CRH or DDAVP (desmopressin) stimulation: 
•  Central to peripheral ACTH ratio ≥ 2 at Baseline, or 
•  Central to peripheral ACTH ratio ≥ 3 after stimulation by either CRH or desmopressin 
c.  Prior pituitary surgery with histopathology confirming an ACTH staining adenoma 
For patients on medical treatment for Cushing’s disease washout periods were defined which should be 
completed prior to Screening assessments. 
Patients with a known history of impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus (HbA1c <8%) were included; 
blood glucose and antidiabetic treatment were monitored closely throughout the study and adjusted when 
necessary. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients who were considered for surgical treatment at the time of study entry or who had received prior 
pituitary irradiation (≤ 10 years prior to visit 1) were excluded.  
In addition, patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes or significant cardiovascular disease, patients with 
liver disease or cholelithiasis and patients who were hypothyroid were excluded. 
Treatments 
Pasireotide LAR was administered as an intra-muscular depot intragluteal injection once every 28 days (±2 
days) by designated study personnel who were blinded to the treatment. Patients were administered pasireotide 
LAR 10 mg or 30 mg for four months, followed by either continuation of the starting dose, or dose up-titration 
(if mUFC was still >1.5xULN unless titration was precluded by safety reasons). 
The first dose of pasireotide LAR was given after all Baseline assessments (including mUFC and ECG) were 
performed at Visit 2. Subsequent doses were to be as close as possible to the same time of day as the first dose. 
Dose increases and decreases were allowed as per guidelines in the study protocol.

Objectives 
Primary objective 
To assess the efficacy of two pasireotide LAR regimens (starting doses of 10 mg and 30 mg followed by 
up-titration if needed or continuation of the same dose) independently in patients with Cushing’s disease after 
7 months of treatment regardless of up-titration at Month 4. 
Key secondary objective 
To assess the efficacy of pasireotide LAR 10 mg and 30 mg doses independently in patients with Cushing’s 
disease after 7 months of treatment who did not up-titrate the dose of pasireotide at Month 4 (patients who had 
their dose up-titrated were counted as non-responders). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Proportion of patients with mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN at Month 7 regardless of prior dose increase. 
Key secondary endpoint 
Proportion of patients with mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN at Month 7 and no dose increase above the randomized dose 
prior to Month 7. 
Other secondary endpoints/assessments 
Actual and percentage change in mUFC from baseline at every month in the core and every three months in the 
extension. 
Other efficacy assessments included plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, pituitary tumour 
volume, and a range of clinical signs of hypercortisolism (including blood pressure and body weight).  
Health-related Quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using two patient -reported outcome (PRO) instruments: 
the single-domain 12-item Cushing's disease quality of life instrument (CushingQoL) and the SF-12v2 General 
Health Survey (SF-12v2). 
Sample size 
In Study B2305 the responder rate (defined as Month 6 mUFC≤ 1.0xULN regardless of dose up-titration) for the 
900 µg bid group was 33% for patients with Baseline mUFC≤ 5.0xULN. Since the up-titration criterion in this 
study is looser than that in Study B2305, the primary efficacy responder rate for each of the two randomized 
dose regimens in this study was expected to be at least 30%. In addition, a primary efficacy response rate 
higher than 15% in this indication would provide significant clinical benefit to patients. If the true primary 
efficacy response rate in each of the randomized dose regimens in this study is 30%, then 74 patients in each 
arm will provide 88% power for the lower bound of the respective 2-sided 95% CI (Clopper Pearson Exact 
Method) to exceed 15%. Therefore, a minimum of 148 patients were to be recruited in this study. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to one of the following two dose arms: 
•  10 mg pasireotide LAR = 10 mg dose arm 
•  30 mg pasireotide LAR = 30 mg dose arm 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 26/78 
  
  
Randomization was stratified based on screening mUFC to ensure balanced distribution of disease severity in the 
two dose arms. There were two strata: 
•  mUFC 1.5xULN to <2xULN 
•  mUFC 2xULN to 5xULN. 
Blinding 
At the sites a pharmacist and/or a study nurse, identified prior to start of the study, was unblinded throughout 
the study and was the only site personnel allowed to reconstitute the study drug. A field monitor identified by the 
sponsor prior to the start of the study remained unblinded and was responsible for monitoring the patient dosing 
records. In addition there was an independent unblinded team within Novartis and the data management 
vendor. 
Patients, Investigators, and site personnel remained blinded to the identity of the treatment arm from the time 
of randomization until all patients had completed Month 12 or discontinued early. 
The UFC was only analysed by the central laboratory identified by the sponsor in order to maintain the blind (in 
situations where patient safety was of concern, investigators were allowed to run a local UFC for quicker results).  
Following the primary analysis which occurred after all patients had completed Month 7 or discontinued early, 
selected Novartis personal were unblinded to dose arms, while Investigators and patients remained blinded until 
the analyses performed at Month 12. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Study G2304 was the proportion of patients that attain mUFC ≤1.0xULN at 
Month 7 in each treatment arm regardless of prior dose increase; the key secondary endpoint was the proportion 
of patients that attain a mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN at Month 7 without prior dose increase above their randomized dose. 
For both analyses, LOCF was used for imputation of missing values at Month 7. A treatment was considered 
effective if the lower bound of the 95% CI was >15%. To ensure that the overall type I error rate is controlled 
at 5% 2-sided level, a hierarchical testing procedure was employed. 
Response rates over time were analysed by calculating the proportion of controlled and partially controlled 
responders at each visit. The following definitions were used: 
•  Controlled responder: mUFC≤ 1.0xULN 
• 
Partially controlled responder: at least 50% reduction in mUFC from Baseline, and mUFC >1.0xULN. 
•  Controlled or partially controlled responder: either of the above 
•  Uncontrolled: Neither controlled nor partially controlled. 
Other efficacy endpoints related to mUFC included analyses of change in mUFC over time, time to and duration 
of first mUFC response, probability of response, and maintenance of response. 
Plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, late night salivary cortisol levels, pituitary tumour volume, and continuous 
parameters of clinical signs of hypercortisolism were analysed using descriptive summary statistics at each 
scheduled visit. Categorical measures of clinical signs of hypercortisolism were analysed using shift tables. 
The analysis for both PRO instruments was performed using a subset of patients with baseline and at least one 
post-baseline measurement. This analysis utilized the previously defined minimally important difference (MID) 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 27/78 
  
  
for CushingQoL as well as correlations between CushingQoL and SF-12v2 scores, and correlation of CushingQoL 
with mUFC, blood pressure, weight, and clinical symptoms of Cushing’s disease. 
Selected efficacy parameters were also analysed by Month 7 responder status (i.e. controlled, partial controlled, 
and uncontrolled). 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses by gender, race, age (<65 and ≥ 65 years) and BMI categories (<25, 25 to≤ 30, and >30 
kg/cm2) were conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The influence of demographic factors (gender, race), BMI, baseline diabetic status, and mUFC randomization 
strata was also explored using summary statistics for standardized mUFC over time. 
Establishing a new ULN for UFC 
To minimize variability in the UFC assessment, all measurements of UFC concentration in urine samples were 
performed at a central laboratory. The central laboratory also established the reference ranges (ULN and LLN) 
for UFC based on UFC measurements from healthy volunteers. The ULN established at the start of the study was 
171.02 nmol/24h. However, due to an error in the methodology used by the central laboratory to calculate the 
UFC for the reference range, which was discovered by the Applicant during an audit in November 2014, the ULN 
initially established at the central laboratory was incorrect. Therefore, a new ULN was established and validated 
at the central laboratory using the correct methodology. 
The new ULN was 166.48 nmol/24h, which is only slightly lower than the original ULN of 171.02 nmol/24h. 
Because all patients had already been enrolled in the study at the time the error was discovered, patient 
enrolment and stratification was based on the original ULN. 
Dose up-titration was based on the original ULN prior to 24-Jul-2015, by which time all patients had reached 
Month 7; the new ULN was used to guide dose titration decisions from this date onwards. 
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of the difference between the old ULN and the 
new ULN on study conduct elements impacted by the change (i.e. enrolment, stratification, dose up-titration 
prior to 24-Jul-2015) and on statistical analyses using the ULN. 
The impact of the error in the original ULN is limited, with ≤ 3 patients impacted in any key parameter of the 
study. The change in UFC ULN had no impact on the efficacy results of the study. 
The statistical analyses described in this document are based on the new ULN. 
Study B2305 – study design 
Study B2305 independently evaluated the efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of pasireotide sc. Patients 
were randomized 1:1 to receive pasireotide 600 μg bid or 900 μg bid. A patient’s dose could be up-titrated (from 
600 μg bid to 900 μg bid, and from 900 μg bid to 1200 μg bid) at pre-specified time points during the Core phase 
(Months 3, 6, and 9), for patients whose mUFC met specific criteria. A patient’s dose could be decreased for 
safety reasons to a minimum of 300 μg bid; patients who could not tolerate 300 μg bid were to be discontinued 
from the study. 
The efficacy assessments included UFC, other hormonal parameters (plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, and 
late-night salivary cortisol), clinical signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism, pituitary tumour volume, and 
HRQoL assessed using the CushingQoL instrument. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 28/78 
  
  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved UFC ≤1.0xULN in each of the 
pasireotide sc treatment arms at Month 6, and who did not have a dose increase (relative to the randomized 
dose) prior to Month 6. 
The original submission for pasireotide sc in Cushing’s disease included all data from Study B2305 collected up 
to the cut-off date of 17-Mar-2010, at which time all patients had completed the 12-month core phase or 
discontinued. The study has now been completed, and the data have been reported in an updated CSR.  
Results  
The sections below focus on the results of the registration study G2304 that was conducted with the pasireotide 
long-acting formulation. 
Results from Study B2305 (conducted with the pasireotide s.c. formulation) are presented as well to provide an 
overview of efficacy of both formulations of pasireotide in patients with Cushing’s disease. 
Any between-study comparisons must be made with caution due to several key differences in study design 
(summarized in Table 7) and patient populations.

Participant flow  
Study G2304 
Study G2304 enrolled a total of 150 patients; 74 patients were randomized to the 10 mg arm, and 76 patients 
to the 30 mg arm. As of the cut-off date (10-Nov-2015), all patients had completed the Core phase or 
discontinued.

Table 5 Patient disposition (randomized set) - Study G2304 
Study B2305 
In Study B2305, the first patient first visit occurred on 22 -Dec-2006. 162 patients received study treatment (82 
patients in the 600 μg bid arm, and 80 patients in the 900 μg bid arm). 78 (48.1%) patients completed the 
12-month core phase (39 in each arm), and 58 patients (35.8%) entered the long-term extension (26 in the in 
the 600 μg bid arm, and 32 in the 900 μg bid arm). During the extension phase, 16 patients had the option to 
enrol in a long-term study or transition to commercially available pasireotide sc. As of 21-May-2014, all patients 
were off study treatment, and the study was closed. 
Overall the most frequent reason for discontinuation of study drug was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (53 
patients, 32.7%), AE (36 patients, 22.2%), and withdrawal of consent (30 patients, 18.5%), and these reasons 
were balanced between the two treatment arms. Patients who chose not to enter the extension (20 patients), or 
who transitioned to a long-term study or commercial pasireotide sc (16 patients), are not counted as 
discontinuations.

Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended five times. These five amendments were all implemented before the database 
lock for the primary efficacy analysis at Month 7, and previous sections of this report describe the study conduct 
as amended.  
Modifications to the analysis plan were made after the Month 7 database lock (at which time key efficacy and 
safety analyses were conducted, but no CSR was prepared), and prior to the Month 12 database.  
Protocol deviations 
Twelve (8.0%) patients had protocol deviations that excluded them from the per-protocol analyses. The 
primarily reason for exclusion from per-protocol set was less than two 24-hour UFC samples available at 
Screening or at Baseline (Table 9).

Baseline data 
Study G2304 
Demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced in the two dose arms (Table 10).

Table 7 Demographic and disease characteristics in Study G2304 (FAS) 
As expected in a patient population with Cushing’s disease, patients in Study G2304 were on average 
hypertensive (a substantial proportion of patients was on anti-hypertensive medication at baseline, and the 
mean blood pressure was 132/86 mmHg), overweight or obese (mean BMI 29 kg/m2, mean waist circumference 
102 cm), and had elevated cholesterol levels (mean 5.7 mmol/L). 
Study B2305 
The demographic characteristics in Study B2305 were similar to those of Study G2304 in terms of age (median 
39 years (range 18 to 71) and gender distribution (women accounted for 77.8% of patients). The study enrolled 
a higher proportion of Caucasian patients (78.4%); Asians accounted for 12.3% of patients. Similar to G2304, 
the majority of patients (79.0%) had undergone previous pituitary surgery, and entered the study with 
persistent/recurrent disease (83.3%). 
The baseline mUFC levels were higher in Study B2305 (median mUFC 564.5 nmol/24h; 3.9xULN) than in Study 
G2304 (median mUFC 396.9 nmol/24h; 2.4xULN), reflecting the difference in enrolment criteria (in Study 
B2305, no upper limit for a patient’s mUFC was imposed). The median baseline mUFC was higher in the 600 μg 
bid arm (730 nmol/24h; 5.0xULN) than the 900 μg bid arm (487 nmol/24h; 3.4xULN); unlike Study G2304, 
randomization was not stratified by screening mUFC.

Numbers analysed 
Study G2304 
All patients randomized (150 patients, 100%) received at least one dose of study medication, and all patients 
received the dose they were randomized to; as a result, the full analysis set and the safety set were identical. 
The per-protocol analysis set consisted of patients who did not have major protocol deviations. The PK analysis 
set (PAS) consisted of all patients in the safety set who had at least one valid post-dose PK assessment (Table 
11).

Outcomes and estimation 
Study G2304 
• 
Primary and key secondary endpoint 
In Study G2304, both the 10 mg and 30 mg dose arms met the primary and key secondary endpoints: 
• 
• 
In the primary efficacy analysis, the response rate at Month 7 was similar in both arms:  41.9% (95% 
CI: 30.5, 53.9) in the 10 mg arm and 40.8% (95% CI: 29.7, 52.7) in the 30 mg arm.  
In the key secondary efficacy analysis, all patients who had a dose increase prior to Month 7 (31 patients 
in the 10 mg arm, and 28 patients in the 30 mg arm) were considered non-responders. In this analysis, 
the response rates were 28.4% (95% CI: 18.5, 40.1) and 31.6% (95% CI: 21.4, 43.3) in the 10 mg and 
30 mg arms, respectively.  
A treatment was considered effective if the lower bound of the 95% CI was >15%.

Responders: patients with mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN, regardless of dose-titration. 
Missing Month 7 mUFC was imputed using LOCF methodology using last mUFC value at or after Month 4. Month 
7 mUFC was imputed for 2 responders in the 10 mg arm, and none in the 30 mg arm. 
These results also show that dose up-titration allowed additional patients to achieve a response in the primary 
efficacy analysis, especially in the 10 mg arm, where 10 of 31 patients (32.3%) who were responders at Month 
7 had their dose increased to 30 mg prior to Month 7. In the 30 mg arm, 7 of 31 patients (22.6%) who were 
responders had their dose increased to 40 mg prior to Month 7.  
Furthermore, among the subset of patients who were uncontrolled by Month 4 (27 in the 10 mg arm, and 23 in 
the 30 mg arm), the proportion of patients who achieved mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN at Month 7 was higher among those 
whose dose was up-titrated (6/17 patients, 35.3%) and 2/12 patients, 16.7% in the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, 
respectively) than those who were not (1/10 patients, 10.0% and 1/11 patients, 9.1% in the respective arms). 
Pre-planned sensitivity analyses and supportive analyses confirmed that the results are robust. These include 
analyses of the per-protocol set, sensitivity analyses using alternate methods to account for missing values, and 
analyses performed without LOCF. Of note, for both the primary and key secondary analysis, a missing Month 7 
mUFC value was imputed for 2 responders in the 10 mg arm, and none in the 30 mg arm, thus the influence of 
missing values on the primary and key secondary efficacy results was minimal. 
The response rates in study G2304 are numerically higher than those reported for the corresponding analyses 
in study B2305: 
1.  The response rates in the primary efficacy analysis were 14.6% and 26.3% in the 600 µg bid and 900 µg bid 
arms, respectively, at Month 6. In this analysis, patient with prior dose increase were considered 
non-responders. 
• 
this analysis corresponds to the key secondary endpoint in G2304 (response rate 28.4% and 31.6% in 
the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively)

2.  The proportion of patients with mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN regardless of prior dose increase was 15.9% and 28.8% in 
the 600 µg bid and 900 µg bid arms, respectively, at Month 6

•  Other analyses related to mUFC 
Supportive efficacy analysis 
As a supportive analysis for the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients who were controlled (mUFC ≤ 
1.0xULN), partially controlled (≥ 50% reduction in mUFC from baseline), or a combination of both were 
calculated for Month 7 (Table 13). Missing mUFC values were imputed using LOCF.

Response rate and screening/baseline mUFC 
In Study G2304, a trend towards higher response rates for patients with lower mUFC levels at study entry was 
observed: the response rates were higher in the lower mUFC stratum (mUFC 1.5xULN to <2.0xULN), than the 
higher mUFC stratum (2.0xULN to ≤ 5.0xULN). In the primary efficacy analysis, the response rates in the lower 
mUFC stratum were 52.0% in both arms, and 36.7% and 35.3% in the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively, in 
the higher mUFC stratum (see Table 12). In the key secondary efficacy analysis, the response rates in the lower 
mUFC stratum were 36.0% and 48.0% in the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively, and 24.5% and 23.5% in the 
respective arms in the higher mUFC stratum,  
These results are consistent with what was observed in Study B2305, and were as expected considering that for 
a patient with high baseline mUFC, a relatively larger decrease in mUFC is required to achieve a response. 
Nevertheless, in both studies, responses were also seen in patients with high baseline mUFC (study G2304, 
Figure 5; study B2305, Figure 6).

Response rates over time 
In Study G2304, the proportion of controlled responders (i.e. patients with mUFC ≤1.0xULN) was numerically 
higher in the 30 mg arm than the 10 mg arm from Month 1 to Month 4 (i.e. before dose up-titration was 
allowed). At Month 4, the proportion of controlled patients was 31.1% and 36.8% in the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, 
respectively. After Month 4, the proportion of controlled responders was similar in both arms. The response 
rates in both arms remained relatively stable over time up to the end of the 12-month core phase.

Change in mUFC levels from baseline 
In Study G2304, mean and median mUFC levels decreased within the first month of treatment with pasireotide 
(Figure 7), consistent with what was observed in Study B2305 with the pasireotide s.c. formulation. At Month 
4, the median % decrease in mUFC was 43.3% and 45.3% in the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively. By the 
time the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed in Study G2304 (Month 7), the median % decrease in mUFC 
was approximately 48% in both dose arms (Table 14), which is similar to the % median decrease observed in 
Study B2305 at the corresponding time point (~48%) at Month 6.  
In both studies the decrease in mUFC levels was sustained to the end of the 12-month core phase and during the 
extension phase.

Changes in plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels from baseline 
In Study G2304, baseline mean plasma ACTH levels were 16.3 pmol/L and 15.6 pmol/L in the 10 mg and 30 mg 
arms, respectively. Mean plasma ACTH levels decreased below baseline levels within the first month of

treatment in both dose arms, and remained below baseline levels thereafter. The mean and median change from 
baseline were numerically higher in the 30 mg arm at all time points up to Month 4, with no consistent difference 
observed thereafter up to Month 12 in terms of change from baseline, or mean plasma ACTH levels. 
A decrease in mean serum cortisol levels was also apparent within the first month of treatment. Both plasma 
ACTH and serum cortisol levels remained below baseline levels up to the end of the 12-month core phase.  
These results are similar to those seen in Study B2305 for the pasireotide s.c. formulation, where decreases in 
mean plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels were observed within the first month of treatment. 
Changes in pituitary tumour volume 
In Study G2304, reductions in pituitary tumour occurred on pasireotide treatment in both arms. Of the 117 
patients who had a visible (assessable by MRI) pituitary tumour at baseline, 33 patients (28.2%) had a 
reduction (≥ 20%) in pituitary tumour volume at Month 12. Considering only the 73 patients who were assessed 
for tumour volume both at baseline and at Month 12, the proportion of patients with a ≥ 20% reduction in 
tumour volume was 45.2% (33/73 patients). 
Similar % reductions in pituitary volume were seen in both dose arms. For both arms combined, the % median 
decrease from baseline was 11.7% at Month 7 (n=90), and 17.2% at Month 12 (n=73). Data from patients in 
the extension show that pituitary tumour volume continued to decrease, with median % decrease from baseline 
of 23.3% at Month 18 (n=36), and 25.2% at Month 24 (n=26).  
Pituitary tumour volume data were available from a relatively small group of patients in Study B2305, and must 
therefore be interpreted with caution. In the 600 µg bid arm, analysis of % change from baseline provided clear 
evidence of tumour shrinkage only after Month 12, whereas in the 900 µg bid arm, pituitary tumour shrinkage 
was seen from Month 6 onwards. 
Changes in clinical signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism 
In both dose arms, the decrease in mUFC was paralleled by improvements in clinical signs and symptoms of 
Cushing’s disease, such as SBP, DBP, BMI, waist circumference, weight, LDL, HDL and total cholesterol. The 
sustained improvement in SBP and DBP may in part be due to improvements in the underlying disease and 
associated comorbidities, such as obesity, and insulin resistance. 
Favourable shifts in categorical parameters were seen as well. At Month 7, the majority of patients had either 
improvement or no change in all symptoms assessed, compared to baseline (Table 15). Similar results were 
recorded at Month 12.

In patients who were controlled at Month 7 (i.e. achieved mUFC ≤ 1.0xULN), the improvement in SBP was more 
pronounced than in patients who were uncontrolled at Month 7. In controlled patients, the mean decrease in SBP 
at Month 7 was 10.1 mmHg in the 10 mg arm and 8.5 mmHg in the 30 mg arm; in uncontrolled patient, the 
mean decrease in SBP was 2.3 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg in the respective arms. The improvement in SBP was 
sustained long term (beyond the 12-month core phase for patients who continued in the extension). 
Improvements in body weight (i.e. decrease ≥ 5%) were seen in the 30 mg arm among patients who were 
controlled at Month 7, with a mean % decrease from baseline in body weight of 7.6% at Month 7, and 9.4% at 
Month 12. Smaller decreases in mean body weight were seen for uncontrolled patients in the 30 mg arm. The 
mean % decrease in body weight was smaller in the 10 mg arm for both controlled and uncontrolled patients, 
compared to those in the 30 mg arm.

set 
The results in Study G2304 are consistent with those seen in Study B2305, where similar trends of improvement 
in continuous measures with decreasing mean mUFC levels were observed as in Study G2304.  
Patient-reported outcomes 
In Study G2304, the effect of the two pasireotide dosing regimens on patients’ quality of life was assessed with 
the disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure CushingQoL, and the generic quality of life

measure SF-12v2. The results for both PRO instruments indicate that patients experienced an improvement in 
their quality of life with pasireotide treatment. Mean CushingQoL scores improved in both dose arms, similar to 
what was previously observed in Study B2305. Approximately a third of the patients in both dose arms in Study 
G2304 had a clinically relevant improvement in CushingQoL scores, defined as a mean change from baseline 
meeting the established minimal important difference (MID) of 10.1 points. Improvements were seen in the 
Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of the SF12v2 instrument as well, with the mean change from 
baseline for both dose arms combined exceeding the established MID of 3.0 points at Month 4 and Month 7. 
An association was observed between reduction in mUFC and improvement in SF-12v2 MCS and CushingQoL 
(p<0.05), supporting that improvements in mUFC were associated with benefits in quality of life.  
Subgroups of the study population 
Subgroup analysis by demographic factors (gender and race) did not reveal any consistent difference in the 
primary efficacy endpoint between these subgroups in Study G2304.  
The study only enrolled 3 patients who were ≥ 65 years of age, however as responses were seen among these 
patients as well (one patient was controlled, and one patient was partially controlled at Month 7), the data do not 
indicate any difference in the efficacy of pasireotide in older patients with Cushing’s disease. 
Ancillary analyses 
Long-term use 
In both studies, the decrease in mUFC seen during the 12-month core phase of each study was sustained even 
beyond Month 12 for patients who continued in the extension phase of the respective studies. In Study G2304, 
the median % decrease in mUFC was 51.9% at the end of the core phase (Month 12, n=104, both arms 
combined); the median % decrease in mUFC was 65.9% at Month 24 (n=37), and 91.1% in the single patient 
who had reached the Month 48 visit. The improvements in clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease 
observed during the 12-month core phase (e.g. systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, BMI, waist 
circumference, and total cholesterol levels) were maintained in patients for whom data are available in the 
extension.

No statistical comparison between groups was made. The outcome was 
considered clinically relevant if the lower 95% CI > than 15%. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Patients with renal impairment and hepatic impairment were not included in study G2304. Thus, no new data in 
these populations have been provided.  
No separate analysis of the results in the elderly age group has been provided since only three subjects in the 
study were older than 65 years. 
2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With this submission, the Applicant has provided data from two clinical trials, of which G2304 is the pivotal 
study. Study G2304 was a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study of pasireotide 10 mg and 30 mg in patients 
with Cushing’s disease, consisting of a 12-month core phase and an open-ended, optional extension. Study 
B2305 used the subcutaneous formulation of pasireotide and was the pivotal study in the MAA for that 
formulation comparing two different doses of pasireotide. In both studies, up-titration was done at prespecified 
time-points whereas down-titration was made when necessary for safety reasons. Study B2305 provides 
supportive data including long-term data up to 60 months in 15 out of originally 153 subjects. The final study 
report for B2305 has been provided.

No dose-finding study was performed; instead the dose selection was based on PK/PD data from the 
development program supporting the approval of the s.c. formulation, together with PK data for the long-acting 
formulation from healthy volunteers. The rationale for dose selection appears adequate and justifies the lack of 
dose-finding studies. The doses selected (10-40 mg) corresponds to the dose range investigated in study B2305 
with regards to exposure to pasireotide. 
Study G2304 compared two different doses of pasireotide, i.e. the study design was similar to that applied in 
study B2305. In line with the CHMP advice, the doses selected were in the lower and upper range of the dosing 
interval, based on the data from study B2305. The study investigated a dose-range from 10 to 40 mg, with the 
option to down-titrate the dose to 5 mg for tolerability reasons. Only down-titrations were allowed during the 
first four months whereas up-titrations were to be made at month 4, 7 or 9 if treatment target was not met. The 
study duration of 12 months with assessment of the primary endpoint at 7 months is in line with the CHMP 
advice. Dose titration and the evaluation of the primary endpoint occurred one month later in study G2304 
compared to study B2305. The study design and study objectives were adequate and acceptable. 
The inclusion criteria were set in order to ensure that patients with Cushing’s disease were included. Additional 
criteria were applied to ensure that patients with pseudo-Cushing patients were not included taking into account 
the relatively low mUFC limit of ≥ 1.5xULN. Exclusion criteria were mainly focused on excluding patients with 
conditions that could worsen due to the known safety profile of pasireotide. 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were adequate. The key secondary endpoint in study G2304 
corresponds to the primary endpoint in study B2305. The remaining secondary and exploratory endpoints were 
relevant in order to further assess the efficacy of pasireotide. 
Sample size calculations were guided by the outcome of study B2305 and are considered adequate. Patients 
were stratified by severity of the disease in order to ensure a balanced distribution between groups. Patients, 
investigators, and site personnel remained blinded until all patients had completed month 12.  The statistical 
methods applied were adequate. The use of LOCF for imputation of missing values is considered conservative in 
this setting. 
During an audit, the Applicant discovered an error in the methodology used for establishing the reference ranges 
(ULN and LLN) for UFC. The difference between the old (171.02 nmol/24h) and the new ULN (166.48 nmol/24h) 
was small. All patients were enrolled and dosed based on the old ULN up to month 7 of the study. The Applicant 
investigated the impact of the change in reference range or UFC. With regards to inclusion criteria the change in 
reference range only resulted in minor errors: a) 2 patients in the high dose group and 1 patient in the low dose 
group were assigned to the wrong stratum, and b) two patients were included with mUFC > 5xULN. Three 
patients in the low dose group missed three potential titrations. However, response rates for both the primary 
and key secondary endpoints remained unchanged thus the change in reference range did not affect the 
outcome or interpretation of the study. 
The protocol was amended five times and all amendments were implemented before the analysis of the primary 
endpoint. None of the amendments are considered to affect the outcome or the interpretation of the study. The 
changes made to the analysis plan did not have any impact on the primary or key secondary endpoints. 
The FAS included all randomised patients. Twelve patients (8 %) were excluded from the PP set due to protocol 
violations. Out of these twelve patients, two patients (one in each group) were stated to have violated the 
inclusion criterion of mUFC ≥1.5xULN or ≤5xULN and nine patients had only 1 or no 24-hour UFC measurement 
at screening or baseline.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The population recruited in study G2304 appears representative of the target population. The majority of 
patients were female and only three patients were older than 65 years. More than 80% of patients had recurrent 
of persisting disease. There were no major imbalances between the groups.  
The demographics of the patients included in study G2304 were comparable to those included in study B2305, 
except that in study B2305 no upper limit was imposed for mUFC (patients whose mUFC was ≥ 1.5xULN were 
eligible) which resulted in a higher mUFC in  study B2305 compared to study G2304.  This indicates that the 
population in study B2305 had more severe disease than the population included in study G2304. 
The proportion of patients who discontinued was comparable between dose groups (about 30% in the core 
phase of the study) and the number of patients who entered the extension phase was similar (40 and 41 
patients). The reasons for discontinuation however differed with a higher proportion that discontinued due to 
lack of efficacy in the high dose group (25% vs 12% in the low dose group). This is somewhat unexpected, 
especially since the mUFC was slightly lower in the 30 mg group compared to the 10 mg group. Discontinuation 
due to AEs only marginally differed, whereas more patients discontinued due to withdrawal of consent in the low 
dose group (16% vs 10% in the high dose group). In study B2305 the discontinuation rates and reasons for 
discontinuation were comparable to those observed in study G2304. 
There was no difference between groups with regards to the outcome of the primary endpoint with 42% 
responders in the low dose group and 41% responders in the high dose group. This may at least partially be 
explained by the fact that 24% of patients in the 10 mg group had been up-titrated to 40 mg at month 7, 
compared to 53% of patients in the 30 mg group. Thus dose-titration did recruit more responders since the 
response rates were lower for the key secondary endpoint, with numerically more responders in the 30 mg dose 
group (32% vs 28%). The response rate was higher in the stratum with lower mUFC (52% in both groups). 
These data suggests that the dose titration scheme implemented in the study is effective. Response rates 
remained stable up to 12 months, indicating that the efficacy of pasireotide is maintained long term. 
Higher response rates were observed in study G2304 than in study B2305 where the response rate (NB in 
patients without up-titration) was 14.6 % and 26.3 % in the 600 µg bid and 900 µg bid arms, respectively. It 
should however be taken into account that study B2305 recruited patients with higher mUFC at baseline than did 
study G2304. 
The proportion of patients partially controlled was higher in the 30 mg dose group (15.8% vs 8.1% in the low 
dose group) resulting in a higher proportion of patients controlled or partially controlled in this group (56.6% vs 
50% for the 30 mg and 10 mg group, respectively). 
Individual data on the change in mUFC for both study G2304 and study B2305 have been presented. These data 
show that patients in study G2304 in general had a lower mUFC than patients in study B2305. The vast majority 
showed a decrease in mUFC, but some patients apparently failed on therapy as shown by increased mUFC levels. 
This finding high-light the importance of monitoring the effect and reconsider treatment in case of treatment 
failure. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC,. 
The individual data also show that about 5-6 patients in both groups had a mUFC well above 5xULN at baseline. 
Inclusion was based on mUFC at screening and some patients had been on cortisol-lowering therapy. Therefore 
further increase in mUFC could possibly be expected between screening and baseline in such patients after the 
wash-out period. It is noteworthy that, although lower baseline mUFC was associated with a higher response 
rate, 1 out of 5 patients in the 10 mg group and 4 out of 6 patients in the 30 mg group with a baseline mUFC >

Page 45/78 
  
  
5xULN were responders at month 7 indicating that treatment success is not only due to the mUFC at treatment 
initiation.  
However, notably three patients in the 10 mg group and four in the 30 mg group appear to have had mUFC < 
1 at baseline and about 12 patients in the low dose group and about 10 patients in the high dose group appear 
to have had a mUFC < 1.5xULN at baseline. All these patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (mUFC at screening). 
A scatter plot for the screening and baseline values shows that the intrasubject variation is high, with patients 
both showing higher and lower mUFC at baseline compared to screening. This may in part be explained by the 
difficulties associated with the collection of (three) 24-hour urine samples. The Applicant has provided additional 
analyses where patients with a baseline mUFC <1.5xULN were a) excluded or b) considered as non-responders. 
Exclusion of patients (a) from the analysis resulted in an about 2% reduction in response rates compared to the 
primary analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoints. When the most conservative analysis (b) was 
applied, a 10% reduction in the response rate was observed. The physician’s decision to treat a patient would 
possibly be based not only on a (high) pathological UFC but also on the severity of disease symptoms, it is 
therefore agreed that the protocol-prespecified analysis is the most accurate way to present the data. 
The mUFC levels decreased within the first month of treatment and continued to decrease up to month 7 after 
which the levels remained stable in patients remaining in the study up to month 12. The changes observed for 
ACTH and s-cortisol were consistent with the changes observed for mUFC. No apparent differences were 
observed between the two doses. 
Change in pituitary tumour volume was an exploratory endpoint and 117 patient had a visible tumour at baseline 
and 73 of these patients had tumour volume assessed both at baseline and at Month 12. Out of these 73 
patients, 33 (45.2%) showed a reduction of tumour volume greater than 20%. 
The majority of patients reported stable or improved signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism and about 30% 
reported an improvement of symptoms. A decrease in SBP was also observed, with the largest decrease 
observed in controlled patients. A decrease of ≥ 5% was reported by 78% in the 10 mg group and 63% in the 
30 mg group. The change was sustained throughout the study. Improvements in body weight (particularly those 
in the 30 mg arm among patients who were controlled at month 7) were also observed. In the 10 mg group and 
the 30 mg group respectively, 62% and 71% of patients reported weight decrease of ≥ 5%. 
Data from the patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure CushingQoL, and the generic quality of life measure 
SF-12v2 showed that clinically relevant improvements, defined as changes exceeding the MID, were achieved 
for both instruments. 
Subgroup analyses did not show any apparent differences when data was analysed by sex and race. The 
response rate was low in the subgroup of males in the 30 mg group, but the number of patients was low, making 
the estimates uncertain. 
Long-term data from the extension of study G2304 is still not complete but support that the effect is maintained 
in a relevant proportion of patients. These data are supported by the data from study B2305, although it should 
be noted that the number of patients remaining in the study was very low (16 subjects still ongoing at study 
closure). In study G2304, at the end of the core phase (i.e. month 12), the proportion of controlled and partially 
controlled responders was 44.0% (66/150) for both dose arms combined. At month 24, 29.3% of patients 
(29/99) were controlled or partially controlled responders.

2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Based on the data from study G2304 it can be concluded that long-acting pasireotide (LAR) is efficient in the 
treatment of Cushing’s disease. Although comparisons should be made with caution due to differences in study 
design and the severity of the disease in the populations included, the effect of pasireotide LAR appears 
comparable to that of the s.c. formulation. Secondary and exploratory endpoints support the conclusion. Some 
data has been provided from the ongoing extension phase of study G2304, indicating that the effect is 
maintained in a relevant proportion of patients up to 24 months. 
Currently s.c. pasireotide is approved for treatment of Cushing’s disease. With the LAR formulation also 
approved in this indication, there is a need for recommendations on how to switch from the s.c. formulation to 
the LAR formulation and vice versa (although the later alternative may be less common). Advice on this has 
been included in the SmPC. 
2.4.9.  Clinical safety 
In this submission, safety data for pasireotide long-acting formulation in Cushing’s disease are available from 
study SOM230G2304 (hereafter G2304). This submission also includes important safety information from the 
supportive studies B2305 (which formed the basis of approval of the pasireotide s.c. formulation in Cushing’s 
disease), C2305 and C2402 (which both supported the approval of the long-acting formulation of pasireotide in 
acromegaly (Table 17). 
Study G2304 comprises a 12-month core phase (followed by an optional extension phase). Patients started 
treatment with either 10 mg or 30 mg pasireotide, followed by dose up-titration (to maximum 40 mg) or 
continuation of the starting dose after the first 4 months of treatment. 
The primary analysis for Study B2305 was conducted when all patients had completed at least 12 months of 
treatment or discontinued (data cut-off, 17-Mar-2010). Additionally, long-term data from Study B2305, 
including all data from study start to last patient last visit (data cut-off, 21-May-2014), were reported in a final 
CSR which is provided as part of this submission. 
The primary analysis of study C2305 was conducted when all patients had completed at least 26 months of 
treatment or discontinued (data cut-off, 29-Dec-2011). In this SCS, the focus is on patients who started 
treatment with pasireotide from the beginning of the core phase up to at least 12-Month of core phase or early 
discontinuation (up to crossover).

Table 17 Overview of key studies for the safety analysis and their status 
Patient exposure 
In study G2304, exposure of pasireotide LAR in Cushing’s disease is available in 150 subjects in doses from 5 mg 
up to 40 mg (Table 5). Supportive safety data in on use with pasireotide (s.c.) in Cushing’s disease is available 
in 162 subjects in study B2305. Supportive data for use of pasireotide LAR is available from the (pivotal) studies 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 48/78 
  
  
 
in approximately 400 Acromegaly patients (C2305 and C2402) (Table 5).  Besides the submitted data a 
considerable number of patients, with different diagnosis, have been exposed to pasireotide in clinical trials. 
Data from the latest PSUR (DLP 24 Oct 2016) presented an overall exposure of pasireotide in 4036 patients 
(2779 PYE) in clinical trials (completed, ongoing and IITs). 
Dosage 
At Month 4, approximately half of the patients in both groups received their randomization dose. In both groups, 
more than 40% of the patients were up-titrated to a higher dose (Month 4). At Month 12, 27.5% and 17.1% of 
the patients in the 10 mg group and 30 mg group respectively received their randomization dose. At month 12, 
70.7% and 60% of patients in the 30mg group and 10mg group respectively, were up-titrated. The maximum 
dose (40 mg) was received by 40-50% of all patients from Month 7 to Month 12. Thus safety and tolerability 
could be judged as have been sufficiently studied also in this population (Table 18). 
The doses used in study G2304 result in an exposure to pasireotide which is comparable to the exposure 
achieved with the doses used with the s.c. formulation (600 µg and 900µg) in subjects with Cushing’s disease 
(see Efficacy section).  However, the doses used in study G2304 are lower compared to doses used with the LAR 
formulation in the clinical study with acromegaly subjects in study C2305 and C2402 (40 mg and 60 mg).

Table 18 Dose administrated in study G2304 (Safety set) 
Duration of exposure 
In study G2304, the median number of injections was 14.5 (1-50). Median duration of exposure in days was 398 
(28-1393) days. Exposure up-to 12 months was seen in 81/150 (54%) of the patients and up-to 36 months in 
11/150 (7%). 
In the final analysis of study B2305, median duration of treatment with pasireotide sc was 10.37 months 
(minimum-maximum: 0.03-76.6 months). 40 (24.7%), 22 (13.6%), 18 (11.1%), 14 (8.6%) and 6 (3.7%) 
patients had been treated with pasireotide s.c. for at least 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months, respectively. 
Overall, a robust safety dataset is available both with the s.c. and LAR formulation up to 12 months, considering 
that both Cushing’s disease and acromegaly are rare diseases.   Data beyond 12 months have also been 
presented for the s.c. formulation by the final analysis of study B2305 and results from the extension of study 
G2304 will provide further long-term data.

Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
In study G2304, almost all patients (99.3%) reported at least one AE. In total, 93.3% of the patients 
experiencing AEs suspected to be related to pasireotide. The proportion of patients with AEs leading to study 
discontinuation was 12.7%. The overall during the 12 Months the most common AEs were hyperglycaemia 
(48.0%), diarrhoea (39.3%) and cholelithiasis (32.7%). Diabetes mellitus was reported in 21.3% (Table 19). All 
these events were also the most frequently events reported by the investigator as possible related to study drug 
(Table 20).

Table 20 Frequents AEs (more than 10% in study G2304) suspected to be study drug 
related compared to study B2305 and C2305 
Dose differences 
The largest difference in AE frequencies, between the two treatment-groups (starting dose 10 mg and 30 mg 
respectively), was noted for the common reactions cholelithiasis and diarrhoea both at Month 4 and after 12 
months. Events of hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus were reported in slightly higher frequency in the 30 mg 
group at Month 4 but in comparable frequencies after 12 months and events of headache were reported more 
frequently in the 10 mg group compared to the 30 mg group both after 4 and 12 months).  The frequencies of 
events judged as severe and/or life-threatening were slightly higher at Month 4 in the 30 mg group (30.3%) 
compared to 10 mg group (21.6%) but reported in comparable frequencies after 12 months. As discussed 
above, it should be noted that after Month 4 the doses were adjusted to treatment effect, both in the 10 mg and 
30 mg groups, making a direct comparison between the two treatment groups difficult to perform after this visit.  
Cushing’s disease: pasireotide LAR compared (G2304) to s.c. pasireotide (B2305) 
Events from the SOC GI disorders such as diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain were reported with less 
frequency with the LAR formulation (SOC GI disorders study G2304: 63%) compared to the s.c formulation 
(SOC GI disorders study B2305: 81%). Events from the SOC metabolism and nutrition disorders such as 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (82% in study G2304 and 75% in study B2305) as well as events of 
cholelithiasis (33% in study G2304 and 30% in study B2305) were presented in comparable frequencies with the 
LAR formulation compared to s.c. formulation in patients with Cushing’s disease (Table 19).  
Pasireotide LAR: use in Cushing’s disease G2304) compared to use in Acromegaly (C2305) 
Events from the SOC metabolism and nutrition disorders such as hyperglycaemia were presented with higher 
frequencies in the population with Cushing´s disease (82% in study G2304) compared to the acromegaly 
population (61% in study C2305). However, frequencies events from the SOC GI disorders (63% in both 
studies) and cholelithiasis (33% in study G2304 and 29% in study C2305) were reported in comparable 
frequencies between the two indications treated with pasireotide LAR. 
As a conservative approach, no term frequencies have been decreased in the proposed SmPC (e.g., QT 
prolongation which was uncommon in G2304 is maintained as “common” in the combined table), and no terms 
were removed. All 22 terms that were already present in the acromegaly SmPC have been maintained. For two 
terms (nausea and the grouped term abdominal pain), the ADR frequency category was higher in the G2304 
study (14.7% and 11.3%, respectively) and the higher overall frequency category was therefore assigned in the 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 52/78 
  
  
 
 
grouped table for both terms (“very common” instead of “common”). While some minor differences in 
underlying disease-related morbidities is acknowledged, no adverse drug reaction frequencies diverged 
sufficiently between indications to warrant a footnote in the table. 
For all other terms that were previously not present in the acromegaly SmPC, a three-step approach has been 
adopted to update the ADR table for the intramuscular formulation with the findings of study G2304, as 
described by the Applicant in the clinical overview.  
AEs suspected to be drug related 
In study G2304, Hyperglycaemia, diarrhoea, cholelithiasis and diabetes mellitus were the most common AEs 
judged with a causal relationship to study drug by the investigator (Table 20). 
When comparing the studies in subjects with Cushing’s disease on pasireotide LAR (G2304) with s.c. pasireotide 
(B2305) events of hyperglycaemia were reported with a slightly higher frequency compared to s.c. formulation 
and GI events (diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain) with lower frequencies (Table 20). 
When comparing the studies in subjects with Cushing’s disease on pasireotide LAR (G2304) with pasireotide LAR 
in Acromegaly (C2305) events of hyperglycaemia, nausea and fatigue were reported in higher frequencies 
compared to the Acromegaly population. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Thirteen categories of AESI were defined in the clinical development program for pasireotide (Table 21). 
Table 21 Overview of AESI by categories in study G2304, B2305 and C2305 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 53/78 
  
  
 
 
Hyperglycaemia related AESI 
In study G2304, a large proportion (77%) of the subjects on pasireotide develop hyperglycaemia related AEs. A 
tendency toward a slightly greater risk with the higher dose of pasireotide LAR could be noted during the first 
four months of treatment. Overall, only very few (n=2) of the events were defined as SAEs. 
The frequency of hyperglycaemia related AEs with LAR in Cushing’s disease (77%) is comparable to previous the 
studies with s.c. pasireotide in subjects in this population (72% in study B2304). However, the frequencies of 
these events are slightly higher in Cushing’s disease (77% in study G2304) compared to subjects with 
acromegaly (60% in study C2305). Table 21 
Glucose metabolism disorders are reflected in section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 in the SmPC. Hyperglycaemia is also 
reflected below in the section Special safety topics.  
Gallbladder and biliary related AESI 
A dose difference in the incidence of gallbladder and biliary related AESIs could be noted in study G2304 
especially during the first 4 months (10 mg group: 24% and 30 mg group: 45%). However, the overall incidence 
(35% in study G2304) of these events is comparable to previous studies with s.c pasireotide in subjects with 
Cushing’s disease (35%) and the LAR formulation in subjects with acromegaly (36%) (Table 21). 
Gallbladder and related events are considered adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8.  
Liver safety related AESI 
Liver safety related AESIs were reported equally in the two treatment arms (approximately 20% in both arms). 
Most of the AEs were related to increased liver enzymes. The incidence was similar as in previous study in 
Cushing patients treated with s.c. pasireotide (16%) but slightly higher compared to subjects treated with 
pasireotide LAR in the population with Acromegaly (11%) (Table 21). One patient, in study G2304, met 
biochemical criteria for Hy’s law: However, the patients suffered from with concurrent SAE of cholelithiasis, 
acute cholecystitis and oedematous pancreatitis.  
The effect of pasireotide on the liver is considered adequately reflected and covered in the SmPC section 4.4 
(monitoring with liver function test) and section 4.8 (increased liver enzymes).   
Bradycardia related AESI 
Bradycardia is a known phenomenon during treatment with pasireotide. Higher frequencies of bradycardia 
related AEs were noted with higher dose regime (10 mg group: 5% and 30 mg group: 12%). The difference was 
persistent over time. 
The risk for bradycardia during treatment with pasireotide is considered adequately reflected in the SmPC 
section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8.  
Hypocortisolism related AESI 
In study G2304, hypocortisolism-related AESIs were reported in 13 (9%) patients including adrenal insufficiency 
in 10 patients (7%). SAEs of hypocortisolism related events (adrenal insufficiency) were reported in 3 patients. 
The SAEs were all judged as related to study drug. No dose difference was noted. 
Adrenal insufficiency (including blood cortisol decreased) is considered adequately labelled in SmPC section 4.8. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 54/78 
  
  
Low blood cell related AESI 
The risk of haematological abnormalities is known in association to use of pasireotide and includes both 
decreases in haemoglobin and decrease in lymphocytes (see section Laboratory findings).  
In study G2304, low blood cell related AESI was reported in 9% (n=13). Anaemia was reported in 8 cases (5%) 
and in five cases (3%) leukopenia, lymphopenia and/or neutropenia were reported (Table 22). 
Two patients (1.3%) reported grade 3 AEs, no grade 4 AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation were reported. SAE 
was reported in one patient – the patient had anemia. In four (2.6%) of the 13 patients low with blood cell 
related AESI, the events were judged as related to pasireotide long-acting treatment.  In all four cases the 
events were anemia and all four events were occurred in close correlation with UFC decreases.  
Additional analyses for study G2304 showed that decreases in mUFC levels also were associated with decreases 
in WBC and neutrophil counts. However, none of the five cases reporting leukopenia, lymphopenia and/or 
neutropenia were judged as related to treatment with pasireotide by the investigator. 
“Hematological abnormalities” is characterized as an important potential risk in the RMP and the clinical 
relevance of decreased haemoglobin (anaemia) is well characterised and reflected in the SmPC section 4.8. 
However, no information regarding decrease in WBC and neutrophils are reflecting in the SmPC. It is not 
considered that the findings in study G2304 warrant any up-date of the SmPC at present. However, in the latest 
pasireotide PSUSA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009253/201610) it was agreed with the MAH to present a cumulative 
review of cases on patients with AEs related to decreased in WBC in the coming PSUR.  
Table 22 Low blood cell related AESI 
Hypotension related AESI 
Hypotension related AESIs were reported in 9 (6%) patients; all were grade 1 or grade 2 AEs and none were 
SAEs. The mechanism of action and the clinical significance of this finding have not been established. Therefore, 
hypotension is characterised as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Hypotension is part of symptoms associated with hypocortisolism and reflected SmPC section 4.8.

Page 55/78 
  
  
 
Pancreatitis related AESI 
The PT in all cases (n=6) of pancreatitis related AESIs reported in study G2304 related AESIs were events of 
increased lipase. No pancreatitis related SAE was reported. Lipase and amylase increased is considered 
adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
QT-prolongation related AEs 
QT prolongation related AESIs were reported in 6 (4%) patients. The most frequent AE in this category was 
"electrocardiogram QT prolonged" in three (2%) patients with all these events being either grade 1 or 2. There 
was one SAE cardiac arrest (fatal case) Day 431 (after the first dose of pasireotide LAR). The patient died due 
to the cardiopulmonary failure and the Investigator reported that cardiopulmonary failure caused cardiac arrest.  
See also section -Serious adverse events and deaths (subject G2304-3403-00018) below. 
QT-prolongation is a known risk with pasireotide reflected in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8. The incidence of 
QT-prolongation related AEs in study G2304 was not higher compared to previous studies.  
Injection site reaction related AESI 
In study G2304, injection site reaction related AESI were reported in 4 patients (3 %) and similar between the 
two doses. As previous demonstrated (study C2305) injections site reactions with LAR were reported with a 
lower frequency compared to the s.c. formulation (Table 21).   
“Injection site reactions” is listed in SmPC section 4.8 for Signifor LAR.  
Hypothyroidism related AESI (hypothyroidism) 
In study G2304, five events of hypothyroidism were reported (3%), all were grade 1 events and none were SAEs 
or AEs that led to discontinuation.  
Monitoring of pituitary function (e.g. TSH/free T4) is recommended in SmPC section 4.4. 
Hypothyroidism is also listed as an important potential risk in the RMP for pasireotide. 
Growth hormone related AESI 
In study G2304, Growth hormone related AESI (insulin-like growth factor decreased) were rare events reported 
in 2 patients (1.3%), both were grade 1 events. 
Coagulation related AESI 
Patients with abnormal coagulation (PT or PTT elevated by 30% above normal limits) were excluded in study 
G2304 as was patients who received anticoagulants that affect PT or PTT. Lack of safety data in patients with 
severe coagulation abnormalities is reflected in SmPC section 4.4. 
Prothrombin time prolonged is labelled in SmPC section 4.8. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
In study G2304, SAEs were reported in 38 (25%) patients, including 12 (8%) patients who had SAEs suspected 
to be related to pasireotide. The most common SAEs regardless of study drug relationship were cholelithiasis 
(3%; n=4) and pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome (2%, n=3). The safety profile regarding SAEs in study 
G2304 was comparable to that observed in previous studies. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 56/78 
  
  
In total 12 SAEs were judged as related to study drug. All are labelled in the SmPC section 4.8 (cholelithiasis, 
blood cortisol decreased, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia).  
Table 23 Frequent SAEs (more than 1% in any study) regardless of study drug 
relationship in studies G2304, B2305 and C2305 (Month 12 analyses) 
DEATHS 
Study G2304 
Two patients died on-treatment (i.e. within 56 days of last pasireotide dose), both in the pasireotide 30 mg 
group. Neither of the deaths was suspected to be related to study treatment. 
•  Subject G2304-3403-00018, a 45 year-old female, died of cardiopulmonary failure approximately 15 
months (Day 447) after receiving her first dose of pasireotide (last dose of pasireotide received on Day 
431). The Investigator reported that cardiopulmonary failure caused cardiac arrest.  
•  Subject G2304-3802-00005, a 63 year-old female, died of pulmonary artery thrombosis and sepsis a 
month (Day 31) after her first dose of pasireotide. 
Study C2305 
In the Month 26 analysis, two on-treatment deaths occurred on pasireotide. None of the deaths were considered 
related to study drug by the investigator. 
•  Subject C2305-0912-00008, died on day 361 (24 days after receiving 13th injection - extension phase). 
Cause of death was reported as psychotic depression that was precipitated by external circumstances. 
•  Subject C2305-0102-00001, died 23 days after receiving the 20th injection of crossover treatment 
(extension phase – crossover to pasireotide treatment). Cause of death was reported as aortic 
aneurysm rupture.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the 12-month analysis of study G2304, the most commonly reported worst post-baseline abnormalities were 
absolute lymphocytes decreased (33%) and haemoglobin decreased (27%). The majority of haematological 
abnormalities were grade 1 or 2. Shifts to grade 3 abnormalities were reported in three patients: absolute 
lymphocytes decreased (10 mg group), haemoglobin decreased (30 mg group) and patient with prothrombin 
increased (30 mg group). No grade 4 post baseline abnormalities were reported. 
Decrease in haemoglobin and absolute lymphocytes reported in study G2304 is in accordance with results from 
previous studies with pasireotide and somatostatin.  
Low blood cell related AESI are also described in the section “Adverse events of special interest”. 
Clinical chemistry 
In study G2304, a transient elevation in mean AST and mean ALT was observed shortly after the initiation of 
treatment with pasireotide LAR. Following these initial increases, mean AST and mean ALT return to values close 
to those observed at Baseline. AST or ALT values above 5 ULN noted in 7 patients (5%) and one patients noted 
ALT or AST above 8 ULN (Table 24). 
Increase in liver safety parameters (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) reported in study G2304 were consistent with 
the previous reported data. One patient met the biochemical criteria for Hys law this event was associated with 
concomitant SAEs and further described in the section  “Adverse events of special interest”. 
Table 24 Patients with elevations of liver enzymes - Safety set 
The effect of pasireotide on the liver is considered adequately reflected and covered in the SmPC section 4.4 
(monitoring with liver function test) and section 4.8 (increased liver enzymes).   
Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication for pasireotide (SmPC section 4.3). Use of pasireotide in 
subjects with hepatic impairment is covered in SmPC section 4.2.  
Analyses of glycaemic parameters  
Fasting plasma glucose  
Mean FPG levels increased following the first dose of pasireotide LAR, with a peak seen at 3 weeks. The increase 
was dose dependent and more pronounced in patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes at base-line. Overall, in 
subjects with diabetes at baseline (n=60) the FPG increased by 29% at month 12 compared to baseline and by 
54% in subjects with pre-diabetic status (n=23). In subjects with normal b-glucose status at baseline (n=65) 
the FPG had increased by 39% at month 12 compared to baseline. The flattening of the curve might well be a

result of anti-diabetic treatment in all groups but more pronounced in the group of patients with diabetes at 
baseline (Figure 8). 
Figure 7 Mean (SE) FPG during the core phase – safety set 
HbA1c 
At Baseline, a majority of patients in study G2304 (56.7%) had HbA1c <5.7% (62.2% in the 10 mg arm and 
51.3% in the 30 mg arm), and none had HbA1c ≥ 8% (HbA1c >8% at Screening was an exclusion criterion). 
During the study, almost all patients (93.3%) shifted to a worst post-baseline HbA1c value ≥ 5.7% (Figure 9). 
HbA1c followed a similar trend in the supportive pasireotide studies (B2305, C2304 and C2402). 
At baseline, the mean HbA1c levels were < 6% in both dose groups (10mg and 30mg). During treatment, at all 
time points, the mean HbA1c levels were ≤ 7%. There was an initial increase from baseline in HbA1c levels in 
both 10mg and 30mg groups up to month 2, after which the HbA1c remained stable. HbA1c levels were slightly 
higher in the 10 mg group compared to the 30 mg group throughout the core phase of the study (Figure 9).  
These data suggest that hyperglycaemia associated with pasireotide is manageable with commonly used 
therapies.

Figure 8 Mean (SE) change in HbA1c (%) during the Core phase in study G2304 
Time to first hyperglycaemia and time to achievement of HbA1c <7% for patients without diabetes at baseline 
Approximately 50% of the patients without diabetes at baseline develop hyperglycaemia (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or FPG 
≥ 126 mg/d).  
Time to first hyperglycaemia in subjects with normal FPG at baseline (study G2304) had a wide range and the 
median time was significant shorter for the high starting dose (30 mg; 57 days [range: 21-469]) compared to 
the lower starting dose (10 mg: 141 days [range: 21-1149 days]). Introduction of antidiabetic treatment in 
subjects with normal FPG at baseline but later hyperglycaemia reduced HbA1c to < 7% within 1-3 months.

In summary it is of importance to highlight that even Cushing subjects with normal glucose tolerance are at high 
risk to develop hyperglycaemia during treatment with pasireotide LAR. Thus a careful monitoring of blood 
glucose levels is of great importance. This is reflected in SmPC section 4.4.  
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Overall, there was no new safety concerns observed based on analysis of vital signs Blood pressure, Pulse, 
Electrocardiogram – QT prolongation and Gallbladder ultrasound measured in study G2304.  
Blood pressure 
Supine systolic BP (mmHg) was changed from normal at baseline (n=149) to high as worst post-baseline value 
in 3 subjects (2%) and diastolic BP (mmHg) was increased  to high as worst post-baseline value in 15/140  
subjects (10.7%). 
Hypertension is part of symptoms of Cushing’s disease and therefore a causal relationship to study drug is 
difficult to assess. From the efficacy assessment it is noted that some patients showed an increase in UFC during 
the study (Figure 5).  Overall, an association between mUFC changes and BP changes was observed in study 
G2304.  Hypertension, reported as AE, occurred in 21 instances out of a total of over 2700 individual 
measurements. No clear trend between UFC changes and BP changes could be determined at the individual 
patient level. Thus, no apparent causal relationship to study drug is observed. 
Pulse 
Supine Pulse (bpm) was changed from normal at baseline to low as worst post-baseline value in 14 patients 
(9.5%).

The incidence of QTcF >480 ms was <1.5% (n=2) and no episodes of QTcF >500 ms were observed. The two 
patients with isolated QTcF elevations >480 ms were both randomized to 30 mg, with no associated symptoms 
reported during these episodes (Table 25).

Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Patients with renal impairment were not included in study G2304. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment were not included in study G2304. Thus, no new data have been submitted in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Dosage recommendations are based on previous data obtained with 
pasireotide sc.  
Elderly patients 
Analyses were not conducted by age in study G2304 since only three of the 150 patients were > 65 years. Thus, 
no new data have been submitted in elderly patients. Dosage recommendations are based on previous data 
obtained with pasireotide. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity/anti-pasireotide antibodies 
No clinical samples have been collected to evaluate immunogenicity of the pasireotide long-acting formulation in 
the pivotal Study G2304. According to pharmacological data, the observed exposure profiles over time for 
pasireotide s.c. and long-acting formulation in Cushing’s disease patients and acromegaly patients were as 
expected. No abnormal accumulation or elimination was observed after multiple dosing of pasireotide s.c. or 
long-acting formulation in Cushing’s disease patients or in acromegaly patients, suggesting immunogenicity did 
not occur in these patient studies. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions/immunogenicity is defined as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
In total, 37.3% (n=56) of the subjects in study G2304 experienced a reaction (PT) that described a potential risk 
of allergic reactions/immunogenicity.  Three of the events were classified with CTC grade 3 or 4. In 11 cases 
(7.3%) the events were judged as related to pasireotide. The PTs included in these cases were skin exfoliation

(n=6 [4%]), pruritus (n=4 [2.7%]), oedema peripheral (n=2 [1.3%]), hypotension (n=1 [0.7%]), erythema 
(n=1 [0.7%]) and injection site hypersensitivity (n=1 [0.7%]).  
Pruritus is labelled in the SmPC section 4.8 for the s.c formulation and also for the i.m. formulation pasireotide 
LAR.  
The frequencies of allergic reaction were similar in study B2305 (40.7%) but lower in the studies conducted in 
acromegaly subjects (12.8% and 27% in study C2402 and C2305, respectively). 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions are a known risk for pasireotide (reported in 2.7% in study G2304) and further handled 
in the section regarding adverse events of special interest above. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No additional data were generated for this submission.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
In study G2304 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 13% with a similar proportion in the two arms. 
The only AEs leading to discontinuation reported in more than two patients were diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis 
and hyperglycaemia. AEs leading to discontinuation were slightly higher for the population with Cushing’s 
disease (13%) compared to acromegaly patients on pasireotide LAR (8 %), but lower compared to subjects with 
Cushing with s.c. pasireotide treatment (20%). 
2.4.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data set in this submission is based on study G2304, studying two (new) strengths (10 mg and 30 
mg) of the LAR formulation in subjects with Cushing disease.  Supportive  data from the pivotal study for the s.c. 
formulation in Cushing’s disease (B2305) and the two studies included in the submission of the LAR formulation 
in patients with acromegaly (C2304 and C2402) were also submitted. 
In study G2304, the median number of injections was 14.5 (1-50). Median duration of exposure in days was 398 
(28-1393) days. Exposure up-to 12 months was seen in 81/150 (54%) of the patients and up-to 36 months in 
11/150 (7%).  
The dose adjustment at Month 4 makes a direct comparison between the two initial treatment groups (10mg and 
30 mg respectively) difficult to perform. The maximum dose (40 mg) was received by 40-50% of all patients 
from Month 7 to Month 12. Thus safety and tolerability could be judged as have been sufficiently studied also in 
the population using doses of 40 mg. 
Common adverse events 
In study G2304, almost all patients (99%) reported at least one AE in comparable frequencies between the both 
treatment groups. In total, 93% of the patients experiencing AEs suspected to be related to pasireotide. The 
proportion of patients with AEs leading to study discontinuation was 13%.The most common AEs were 
hyperglycaemia (48.0%), diarrhoea (39.3%) and cholelithiasis (32.7%). Diabetes mellitus was reported in 
21.3%. All these events were also the most frequently events reported by the investigator as possible related to 
study drug.  
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 63/78 
  
  
Both at Month 4 and at data cut-off (12 months) AEs of cholelithiasis were reported in a greater proportion of 
patients randomized to the 30 mg arm (18% and 45%) compared to in 10 mg (0% and 20%).  Events of 
hyperglycaemia were reported in slightly higher frequency in the 30 mg group at Month 4 (10 mg: 31% and 30 
mg: 42% respectively) but in comparable frequencies after 12 months (47-48%).  
When comparing the studies in subjects with Cushing’s disease on pasireotide LAR (G2304) with s.c. pasireotide 
(B2305) the frequencies of events reported in the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders (including 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus) were comparable  (82% in study G2304 vs 75% in study B2305). On the 
other hand events in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain) were reported 
with less frequency with the LAR formulation (63% in trial G2304) compared to the s.c. formulation (81% in trial 
B2305).  
When comparing the studies in subjects with Cushing’s disease on pasireotide LAR (G2304) with pasireotide LAR 
in Acromegaly (C2305) events from the SOC metabolism and nutrition disorders such as hyperglycaemia were 
presented with higher frequencies in the population with Cushing´s disease (82% in study G2304) compared to 
the acromegaly population (61% in study C2305). GI events were reported in similar frequencies.  
Events of cholelithiasis were reported in equally high (approximately 30%) in all three studies.   
SAEs and deaths 
In study G2304, SAEs were reported in 38 (25.3%) patients, including 12 (8.0%) patients who had SAEs 
suspected to be related to pasireotide. The only SAEs that were reported in more than two patients were 
cholelithiasis (n=4) and pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome (n=3). No dose difference was noted in study 
G2304. The safety profile regarding SAEs in study G2304 was comparable to that observed in previous studies. 
Two patients died on-treatment (cardiopulmonary failure; pulmonary artery thrombosis and sepsis). Both 
patients were in the pasireotide 30 mg group.  Neither of the deaths was judged as suspected to be related to 
study treatment by the investigators. No new safety concerns are evoked by these cases. Cushing's syndrome 
(CS) causes metabolic abnormalities that determine an increased cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular 
complications in patients with CS cause a mortality rate higher than that observed in a normal population. 
AEs leading to discontinuation were noticed in 13% of the patients. The main reason for discontinuation was AEs 
related to hyperglycaemia, cholelithiasis and/or acute cholecystitis. 
AEs of special interest (AESI) 
Thirteen categories of AESI were defined in the clinical development program for pasireotide and further 
assessed in study G2304. Results of the following AE of special interest were presented in study G2304 as 
expected (known risks with pasireotide) and in accordance with results from the supportive studies: AEs related 
to bradycardia, hypocortisolism, hypotension, pancreatitis, QT-prolongation, hypothyroidism, growth hormone 
deficiency and coagulation.  
Hyperglycaemia and related AEs:  In study G2304, mean FPG levels increased following the first dose of 
pasireotide LAR, with a peak seen at 3 weeks. The absolute increase in FPG was greater in patients with diabetes 
at baseline, followed by pre-diabetic patients and it was more pronounced in patients in the 30 mg group as 
compared to patients in the 10 mg group, particularly during the first 3 months of treatment.   
Median time to first hyperglycaemia (defined as HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL) was 84 days with a wide 
range (21-1149 days). A dose difference was noted with shorter time to the event for the 30 mg group (57 days) 
compared to the 10 mg group (141 days).   
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 64/78 
  
  
Approximately 50% of the patients with normal glucose tolerance at baseline developed hyperglycaemia during 
the study. Introduction of antidiabetic treatment in subjects with normal FPG at baseline, who developed 
hyperglycaemia, normally reduced HbA1c to < 7% within 1-3 months. 
In summary, results in study G2304 demonstrated that also Cushing subjects with normal glucose tolerance are 
at high risk of developing hyperglycaemia during treatment with pasireotide LAR and that time to first 
hyperglycaemia ranged from a few weeks up to years. As reflected in SmPC section 4.4, it is of importance to 
ensure careful monitoring of blood glucose levels during treatment with pasireotide. 
Gallbladder and biliary related AEs: A dose difference in the incidence of gallbladder and biliary related AESIs 
could be noted in study G2304 especially during the first 4 months (10 mg group: 24% and 30 mg group: 45%). 
However, the overall incidence (35% in study G2304) of these events is comparable to previous studies. 
Liver safety and related AESI:  In study G2304, AESIs related to liver safety were reported in 20% of patients 
and events were distributed equally in the two treatment arms. The reactions were all PTs related to increase in 
liver enzymes. The occurrence of AEs related to liver safety are in accordance with results from laboratory 
findings in study G2304.  
Haematology and Low blood cell related AESI: In study G2304, low blood cell related AESI was reported in 9% 
(n=13). Anaemia was reported in 8 cases (5%) and in five cases (3%) leukopenia, lymphopenia and/or 
neutropenia were reported.  
The risk of haematological abnormalities is known in association to use of pasireotide and includes both 
decreases in haemoglobin and decrease in lymphocytes (see section Laboratory findings). The clinical relevance 
of decreased haemoglobin (i.e. anaemia) is well characterised and reflected in the SmPC section 4.8. It is not, 
at present, considered that the findings in study G2304 warrant any up-date of the SmPC regarding decrease in 
WBC and neutrophils. 
Injection site reaction related AESI: In study G2304, the frequency of injection site reactions related to AESI was 
reported in 2.7% (similar between the two doses 10 mg and 30 mg) and lower compared to the use in subjects 
with Cushing’s diseases treated with pasireotide s.c. formulation in study B2305 (17.3%) and study C2305 
(7.9%).  
Safety in special populations 
Patients with renal impairment and hepatic impairment were not included in study G2304. Thus, no new data in 
these populations have been provided. Neither has no new results in the elderly age group been provided since 
only three subjects in the study were older than 65 years.  
No clinical samples have been collected to evaluate immunogenicity of the pasireotide long-acting formulation in 
the pivotal Study G2304.  
No separate presentation of AEs related to allergic reactions has been presented from study G2304 and is 
requested. 
In summary, no new safety concern was detected with pasireotide LAR in subjects with Cushing´s disease based 
results from study G2304. 
2.4.11.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of pasireotide LAR in subjects with Cushing’s disease was in line with previous studies 
with the substance and no new safety concerns were raised with the results from study G2304. Adverse events

were reported in almost all subjects (99%), with the reactions hyperglycaemia (48%), diarrhoea (39%) and 
cholelithiasis (33%) as the most common. The largest difference in AE pattern with the LAR formulation 
compared to treatment with s.c. pasireotide for the population with Cushing’s disease was lower frequencies of 
GI events with pasireotide LAR. When comparing the studies in subjects with Cushing’s disease and acromegaly 
patients on pasireotide LAR the overall frequencies of AE were comparable. However, the AE pattern differed 
somewhat and reactions including hyperglycaemia were reported with higher frequencies in the population with 
Cushing’s disease compared to acromegaly patients.  
As demonstrated in previous studies with pasireotide patients in study G2304 presented an, in most cases, mild 
and reversible elevation of transaminases. Some events of the known risk of bradycardia (9%), QT-prolongation 
(4%) and anaemia (5%) were also noted.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The new claimed therapeutic indication for the long-acting intramuscular (i.m.) formulation of Signifor is:  
“Treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has 
failed.” 
Cushing’s disease is a very rare, debilitating, and life-threatening disease caused by an adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma.  The elevated levels of ACTH stimulate the adrenal glands to 
produce excess cortisol, thereby leading to the subsequent development of the clinical signs and symptoms of 
hypercortisolism. Patients with Cushing's disease have increased morbidity and a mortality rate 4 times higher 
than age- and gender-matched subjects. 
The aim of therapy is primarily to control the increased ACTH levels, thereby reducing the cortisol production. 
Reduction of cortisol levels diminishes the burden of disease in terms of symptoms of hypercortisolism. A 
reduction of tumour volume may also be observed. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pituitary resection of the adenoma is the current first-line therapy for Cushing’s disease, but surgical failure 
rates range between 8 to 31%. For patients not cured by pituitary surgery, irradiation of the pituitary or bilateral 
adrenalectomy are the remaining non-medical treatment options.  
Available pharmacological treatment options generally fullfill a short-term, palliative role and are rarely used 
alone as long-term therapy. Currently ketoconazole is approved for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome which 
includes a number of conditions with increased cortisol production, including Cushing’s disease. Other available 
pharmacological treatments are metyrapone, mitotane, mifepristone and cabergoline. None of the available 
pharmacological treatment options listed, apart from cabergoline, targets the cause of the disease, i.e. the 
pituitary adenoma. Thus there is an unmet medical need in the treatment of patients with Cushing’s disease.  
Pasireotide, in the short-acting formulation for subcutaneous use, has already been shown to be effective in the 
treatment of Cushing’s disease. The long-acting formulation of pasireotide for intramuscular (i.m.) injections 
was developed to provide improved convenience to patients by reducing the number of injections from twice 
daily to once every 28 days. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data from two clinical trials, G2304 and B2305 have been provided, of which G2304 is the pivotal study. 
Study G2304 was a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study of pasireotide 10 mg and 30 mg in patients with 
Cushing’s disease, consisting of a 12-month core phase and an open-ended, optional extension. Study B2305 
used the subcutaneous formulation of pasireotide and was the pivotal study in the MAA for that formulation 
comparing two different doses of pasireotide. 
CHMP assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 71/78 
  
  
Study G2304 compared two different doses of pasireotide (10 mg and 30 mg, every 28 days), i.e. the study 
design was similar to that applied in study B2305. The study included 150 patients (74 in the 10 mg group and 
76 in the 30 mg group). In both groups, patients were up-titrated at month 4 if mUFC was higher than 1.5xULN. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
There was no difference between groups with regards to the outcome of the primary endpoint (response 
regardless of up-titration) with 42% (95% CI; 30.51, 53.94) responders in the low dose group and 41% (95% 
CI; 29.65, 52.67) responders in the high dose group. Since the lower limit of the CI was higher than 15%, the 
primary endpoint was met for both doses. In the 10 mg group 24% of patients had been up-titrated to 40 mg at 
month 7, compared to 53% of patients in the 30 mg group. Dose-titration did recruit more responders since the 
response rates were lower for the key secondary endpoint (response without up-titration), with numerically 
more responders in the 30 mg dose group (32% vs 28%). The response rate was higher in the stratum with 
lower mUFC (52% in both groups). Response rates remained stable up to 12 months. 
Higher response rates were observed in study G2304 than in study B2305 where the response rate (NB in 
patients without up-titration) was 14.6% and 26.3% in the 600 µg bid and 900 µg bid arms, respectively. It 
should however be taken into account that study B2305 recruited patients with higher mUFC at baseline than did 
study G2304. 
The proportion of patients partially controlled was higher in the 30 mg dose group (15.8% vs 8.1% in the low 
dose group) resulting in a higher proportion of patients controlled or partially controlled in this group (56.6% vs 
50% for the 30 mg and 10 mg group, respectively). 
Some patients apparently failed on therapy as shown by increased mUFC levels. The importance of monitoring 
the effect and reconsider treatment in case of treatment failure has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
The outcome of remaining secondary and exploratory endpoints was consistent with the outcome of the primary 
and key secondary endpoint. The mUFC levels decreased within the first month of treatment and continued to 
decrease up to month 7 after which the levels remained stable in patients remaining in the study up to month 12. 
The changes observed for ACTH and s-cortisol were consistent with the changes observed for mUFC. No 
apparent differences were observed between the two doses. 
Change in pituitary tumour volume was an exploratory endpoint and 117 patients had a visible tumour at 
baseline and 73 of these patients had tumour volume assessed both at baseline and at Month 12. Out of these 
73 patients, 33 (45.2%) showed a reduction of tumour volume greater than 20%. 
The majority of patients reported stable or improved signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism and about 30% 
reported an improvement of symptoms. A decrease in SBP was also observed, with the largest decrease 
observed in controlled patients. A decrease of ≥ 5% was reported by 78% in the 10 mg group and 63% in the 
30 mg group. The change was sustained throughout the study. Improvements in body weight were also 
observed. In the 10 mg group and the 30 mg group respectively, 62% and 71% of patients reported weight 
decrease of ≥ 5%. 
Data from the patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure CushingQoL, and the generic quality of life measure 
SF-12v2 showed that clinically relevant improvements, defined as changes exceeding the MID, were achieved 
for both instruments. 
Subgroup analyses did not show any apparent differences when data was analysed by sex and race.

EMA/CHMP/508155/2017 
Page 72/78 
  
  
Long-term data from the extension of study G2304 is still not complete but support that the effect is maintained 
in a relevant proportion of patients up to 24 months. These data are supported by the data from study B2305, 
although it should be noted that the number of patients remaining in this study was very low (16 subjects still 
ongoing at study closure). In study G2304, at the end of the core phase (i.e. month 12), the proportion of 
controlled and partially controlled responders was 44.0% (66/150) for both dose arms combined. At month 24, 
29.3% of patients (29/99) were controlled or partially controlled responders. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Currently, s.c. pasireotide is approved for treatment of Cushing’s disease. With the LAR formulation also 
approved in this indication, there is a need for recommendations on how to switch from the s.c. formulation to 
the LAR formulation and vice versa (although the latter alternative may be less common). The switch situation 
has not been investigated but adequate recommendations have been included in the SmPC based on available 
pharmacokinetic and clinical data. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is mainly based on the pivotal study G2304 including 150 subjects with Cushing’s disease for 
treatment with pasireotide LAR up to a maximal dose of 40 mg. Data up to 12 months is available. An extension 
of the study is ongoing. This submission also includes important safety information from the supportive studies 
B2305 (which formed the basis of approval of the pasireotide s.c. formulation in Cushing’s disease), C2305 and 
C2402 (which both supported the approval of the long-acting formulation of pasireotide in acromegaly.  
In study G2304, 99% reported at least one AE in comparable frequencies between the both treatment groups 
(10 mg: 98.6% and 30 mg 100%). In total, 93% of the patients experiencing adverse events suspected to be 
related to pasireotide. The most common AEs were hyperglycaemia (48%), diarrhoea (39%) and cholelithiasis 
(33%). All these events were also the most frequently events reported by the investigator as possible related to 
study drug (hyperglycaemia: 47%; diarrhoea 32% and cholelithiasis 31%). 
In study G2304, SAEs related to study drug were reported 8% of the patients.  All these SAEs were known 
reactions labelled in the SmPC section 4.8 
Mean FPG levels increased following the first dose of pasireotide LAR, with a peak seen at the 3-week time point. 
In subjects with diabetes at baseline (n=60) the FPG increased 45% at Month 1 compared to baseline and 35% 
in subjects with pre-diabetic status (n=23). In subjects with normal b-glucose status at baseline (n=65) the FPG 
had increased 22% at month 1 compared to baseline. Among all patients, 57% had HbA1c <5.7% at baseline.  
93% of all patients shifted to a worst post-baseline HbA1c value ≥ 5.7% at month 12. Approximately 50% of the 
patients with normal glucose tolerance at baseline develop hyperglycaemia (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or FPG ≥ 126 mg/d). 
Increases in transaminases (ALT or AST >3xULN but <5xULN) were reported in 14% of the patients any time 
during the 12 Months study period. ALT or AST >5xULN but <8xULN were reported in 5%, one patient had ALT 
>8xULN.  Overall, liver related AEs were reported in 20%. 
Supine Pulse (bpm) was changed from normal at baseline to low as worst post-baseline value in 14 patients 
(9.5%) and bradycardia related AEs were reported with the same frequency.  
The incidence of QTcF >480 ms (none above 480 ms) was<1.5% and 3% of the subjects reported QTcF increase 
>QTcF increase >60 ms. QT prolongation related AESIs were reported in 6 (4.0%) patients. The most frequent 
AE in this category was "electrocardiogram QT prolonged" in 3 (2.0%) patients with all these events being either 
grade 1 or 2.

Decreased haemoglobin values were reported in 27% of the patients in study G2304 and events of anaemia in 
5%. 
Overall, the safety profile in study G2304 were in accordance with the supportive studies (B2304 and C2304). 
The largest difference in AE pattern with the LAR formulation(G2304)  compared to treatment with s.c. 
pasireotide (study B2305) for the population with Cushing’s disease was lower frequencies of GI events with 
pasireotide LAR (events in SOC Gastrointestinal disorders in study G2304 was 63% in 81% in trial B2305). When 
comparing the studies in subjects with Cushing’s disease and acromegaly patients on pasireotide LAR the AE 
pattern differed somehow and events the SOC metabolism and nutrition disorders such as hyperglycaemia were 
presented with higher frequencies in the population with Cushing´s disease (82% in study G2304) compared to 
the Acromegaly population (61% in study C2305). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no new safety concerns, not previously demonstrated with pasireotide, raised by analysis of the 
results from study G2304. The identified safety issues are all covered in the SmPC and reflected in the RMP (and 
accordingly followed in the PSURs). Experience regarding safety with use of the formulation of pasireotide 
Signifor LAR is available from clinical studies and post-marketing since 2015 in patients with Acromegaly. 
Experience with s.c pasireotide in the population with Cushing’s disease is available from clinical trials and 
post-marketing since 2012. Thus, in summary to date there are few uncertainties and limitations about 
unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Cushing’s disease is a severe and debilitating condition due to an overproduction of cortisol caused by excess 
production of ACTH from a pituitary tumour. The only curative treatment is surgical removal of the pituitary 
tumour. All signs and symptoms, except from local symptoms due to tumour growth, are caused by the high 
cortisol levels. Therefore, the reduction in cortisol levels achieved with pasireotide as reflected by decreases in 
mUFC and s-cortisol are important favourable effects of pasireotide treatment. The reduction in cortisol levels 
has further been shown to reduce the clinical signs of the disease, such as the Cushingoid appearance, 
hypertension and overweight. Available long-term data with pasireotide for subcutaneous use indicate that in 
patients responding to treatment the effect can be maintained for up to six years. PRO data support that these 
effects are translated into a better quality of life for the patients. 
The response rates are seemingly low (about 40%). However, considering the limited treatment options when 
pituitary surgery has failed, this is considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the effect of treatment can be 
monitored and the treatment be discontinued in case of insufficient response in the individual patient. 
The data also indicate a positive effect on tumour size. The clinical relevance of these data is still uncertain and 
monitoring of tumour size is necessary due to the risk of tumour growth, as an increase in tumour size may have 
important negative consequences. 
The data presented with this submission are consistent with the data supporting the approval of s.c. pasireotide 
in Cushing’s disease. It has been adequately shown that pasireotide LAR has a clinically relevant effect in the 
treatment of Cushing’s disease. 
The safety profile of pasireotide is well known, both from the clinical programme for pasireotide but also from the 
experience with other somatostatin analogues. Hyperglycaemia, which may lead to overt diabetes, is one of the 
most important unfavourable effects since patients with Cushing’s disease are at increased risk of diabetes due 
to the hypercortisolism per se. Hyperglycaemia is however possible to monitor and the data provided show that 
the patients do respond to anti-hyperglycaemic treatment. Hyperglycaemia is therefore considered to be 
manageable and recommendations on monitoring and treatment are given in the SmPC.  
The other important group of unfavourable effects are gastrointestinal adverse events (mainly cholelithiasis, 
diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) which may limit the use of pasireotide. In this context it should be noted that 
gastrointestinal events appeared to be milder with the LAR formulation compared to the s.c. formulation of

pasireotide. No new safety concerns have emerged based on the data presented with this application. Although 
the unfavourable effects may negatively affect the patients well-being, they are easily identified and in most 
cases manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The beneficial effect of pasireotide i.m. formulation on the hypercortisolism in Cushing’s disease translates into 
important improvements in the signs and symptoms of the disease. Taking into account the severity of the 
disease, these effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. The unfavourable effects can be identified by adequate 
monitoring, i.e. hyperglycaemia and cholelithiasis, and the unfavourable effects are considered to be 
manageable. 
By starting treatment with the lower dose as currently proposed, with uptitration in case of insufficient response, 
the risk of hyperglycaemia is minimised while still assuring that the patient achieves maximal effect since dose 
titration lead to similar outcome in both dose groups. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Signifor, including in its new indication, is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that  Ketoconazole HRA is not similar to Signifor within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Signifor new strengths 10 mg and 30 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection 
is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has 
failed. 
The 60 mg strength is only to be used in the treatment of acromegaly. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Signifor subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Summary of risk management plan for Foclivia (aH5N1) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Foclivia. The RMP details important 
risks of Foclivia, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Foclivia risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Foclivia  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Foclivia should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Foclivia should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).   
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Foclivia 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Foclivia is a pandemic influenza vaccine authorised for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially 
declared pandemic situation.. It contains an inactivated, surface antigen monovalent, influenza 
vaccine  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1.  It  is  to  be  administered  as  two  doses  of  0.5  mL  by 
intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle 
mass). One dose of 0.5 mL at an elected date. And a second dose of 0.5 mL should be given after 
an interval of at least 3 weeks. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Foclivia  benefits  can  be  found  in  Foclivia  EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/foclivia   
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of  Foclivia,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Foclivia risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:  
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;  
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;  
• 
 
 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;  
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Foclivia  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Foclivia. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances 
in  accordance  with 
As  a  specific  post-authorisation  pharmacovigilance  requirement, 
EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014  Guidance  on  Influenza  Vaccines,  the  following  studies  are 
planned: 
•  The Enhanced Safety Surveillance will be performed during the pandemic period aiming 
rapidly collect the data within a month from the start of vaccination. 
•  A  non-interventional  study  of  vaccine  effectiveness  of  pandemic  influenza  vaccine 
(Foclivia®), an analysis of vaccine effectiveness for pandemic influenza vaccination versus 
no vaccination. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
• 
It  is  considered  that  for  the  majority  of  safety  concerns,  routine  pharmacovigilance 
activities  alone  will  be  sufficient.  However,  in  the  situation  of  a  pandemic,  required 
Category 3 Study V87_27OB study is planned to address the missing information Use in 
pregnancy  and  lactation:  V87_27OB  is  a  postmarketing,  observational  cohort  study  to 
evaluate  the  safety  of  pandemic  A/H5N1*  vaccine  (Foclivia®)  in  pregnant  women 
(pregnancy  registry).  This  study  is  planned  in  case  of  pandemic  and  will  follow  from 
enrolment to pregnancy outcome and in live-born infants until 3 months of age. 
* The strain is subject to change to be matched with the next pandemic strain

The use of boosted Prezista with a direct oral anticoagulant

P gp is not recommended as this may lead to an increased 
bleeding risk. 
Darunavir/ritonavir: Clinical monitoring and/or dose 
reduction of the DOAC should be considered when a DOAC 
transported by P gp but not metabolised by CYP3A4, 
including dabigatran etexilate and edoxaban, is co 
administered with Prezista/rtv. 
Darunavir/cobicistat: Clinical monitoring and dose reduction 
is required when a DOAC transported by P gp but not 
metabolised by CYP3A4, including dabigatran etexilate and 
edoxaban, is co administered with Prezista/cobi. 
Rezolsta 
Co administration of Rezolsta with a direct oral 
anticoagulant (DOAC) that is metabolised by CYP3A4 and 
transported by P gp is not recommended as this may lead 
to an increased bleeding risk.

corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and

Co-administration with CYP3A-metabolised corticosteroids 
is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the 
patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be 
monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects. 
Alternative corticosteroids which are less dependent on 
CYP3A metabolism e.g. beclomethasone should be 
considered, particularly for long term use.

OATP1B1/3. Darunavir when used in combination with low-
dose ritonavir or cobicistat may increase the exposure to 
glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (P glycoprotein, BCRP and/or 
OATP1B1/3 inhibition). Therefore, the co-administration is 
not recommended.  
Based on these theoretical considerations, the products

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2 of the 
SmPCs for Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuva to reflect 
the data of the category 3 study TMC114HIV3015 in 
HIV-1 infected pregnant women. The PL of Prezista, 
Rezosta and Symtuza are also updated accordingly. 
Updated RMPs (version 25.6 for Prezista, 4.6 for 
Rezolsta and 4.0 for Symtuza) are agreed 
accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement the template version 2 for the Prezista 
darunavir (DRV)/cobicistat (COBI) arm of the Phase 3b 
Study TMC114HIV3015 in human immunodeficiency virus 
type 1 (HIV-1) infected pregnant women were presented 
and assessed. In total, 7 subjects were enrolled to the 
DRV/COBI arm, of which 6 (85.7%) subjects completed the 
study.  The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that mean 
exposure (AUC) of darunavir boosted with cobicistat was 
56% and 50% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of 
pregnancy, respectively, compared with 6 to 12 weeks 
postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin concentrations were 
~90% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy 
as compared to postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin 
concentrations of 168-184 ng/ml for DRV/COBI during the 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy were below the 
previously targeted 550 ng/ml (EPAR Prezista) and

removal of observational study on growth in children

population’ as important potential risk in the Prezista 
RMP and addition of the missing information ‘Safety 
in patients with cardiac conduction disorders’ in the 
Rezolsta RMP (alignment with Tybost RMP) and 
removal of ‘Use in pregnant and breast-feeding 
women’ as missing information, removal of the 
PANNA study (RMP cat 3), and update of the clinical 
trial and post-marketing sections with most recent 
data up to DLP of 20 October 2017. Correction of 
data for TMC114HIV3015 (DRV/rtv arm) in section 
5.1 of the SmPC were also implemented.

Exposure of cobicistat was 63% and 49% lower during the 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, respectively, 
compared with 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. As the exposure 
of cobicistat is reduced in pregnant women, probably the 
boosting by cobicistat is no longer maximal. 
In view of the observed low exposure values of 
darunavir/cobicistat during pregnancy, the CHMP agreed to 
strongly recommend against the use of darunavir/cobicistat 
during pregnancy. This should apply to pregnant women 
who are already on a DRV/COBI containing regimen, as 
well as to those who are naïve to DRV/COBI.

Submission of the final report from Study GS-US-
236-0140 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This is a randomized, open-label, phase 4 study 
evaluating the renal effect of Elvitegravir/ Cobicistat/ 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF or other Tenofovir DF-
containing Regimens (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir 
plus Emtricitabine /Tenofovir DF or Efavirenz 
/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF) compared to Ritonavir-
boosted Atazanavir plus Abacavir/ Lamivudine in 
Antiretroviral Treatment-naïve HIV-1 Infected Adults 
with eGFR ≥70 mL/min. 
The RMP has been updated accordingly and the 
important potential risks of renal toxicity removed. 
Based on cumulative review of the available data, 
the Prezista and Rezolsta RMPs are updated to 
remove the important risks of ‘pancreatis’, 
‘convulsions’ and  ‘cardiac conduction abnormalities’ . 
The MAH took the opportunity of this procedure to 
include the Annex 7 in the Prezista RMP. 
The consolidated updated RMPs version 25.1 for 
Prezista and version 4.2 for Rezolsta are agreed.

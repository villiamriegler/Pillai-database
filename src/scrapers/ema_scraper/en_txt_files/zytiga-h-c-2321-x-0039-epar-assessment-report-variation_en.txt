During the meeting on 15 September 2016, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the 
scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing 
authorisation to Zytiga on 15 September 2016.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Zytiga, in combination with prednisone/prednisolone-+- (hereafter referred to as prednisone), was approved 
in 43 countries as of 12 April 2012 for the treatment of men with mCRPC whose disease has progressed after 
a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen. 
This submission is intended to obtain the Marketing Authorisation for a new film-coated (FC) tablet 
formulation of Zytiga 500mg tablets to be used in the same currently approved indications of the marketed 
formulation of Zytiga. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined by disease progression despite androgen depletion 
therapy and may present as either a continuous rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, the 
progression of preexisting disease, and/or the appearance of new metastases. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among males in 
most Western countries. Prostate cancer-related deaths occur as a result of complications of metastatic 
disease. In 2008, 323,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 27 EU markets, and 71,000 
patients were lost to the disease (GLOBOCAN 2008 (IARC)). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and prognosis 
Treatment options for symptomatic bone disease are radiation or radionuclide agents and bisphosphonates or 
the RANK ligand inhibitor, denosumab. However, the prognosis of mCRPC patients is still poor, with a median 
survival of approximately 1 to 2 years. 
Despite hormonal therapy, most patients with disease recurrence will progress within 12 to 18 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/538739/2016 
Page 6/29 
  
  
 
2.1.4.  Management 
Based on the results of 2 randomized controlled trials, it is currently recommended that for men with clinical 
or biochemical evidence of progression and evidence of metastases, treatment with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 
administered intravenously every 3 weeks with 5 mg oral prednisone twice daily should be offered to improve 
overall survival, disease control, symptom palliation and quality of life. 
2.2.  About the product 
Abiraterone acetate is a prodrug of abiraterone, an orally active inhibitor of the enzyme, CYP17α (17α-
hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase). Abiraterone acts as an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor by blocking 2 important 
enzymatic activities in the synthesis of testosterone in the testes, adrenals, and within the prostate tumour. 
Abiraterone  acetate  is  3β-acetoxy-17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-diene  that  is  administered  orally  and  is 
available as an immediate release 250 mg tablet. It has the following chemical structure: 
Abiraterone acetate is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor. Abiraterone 
selectively inhibits the enzyme CYP17∝. This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor 
tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone and 
progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, 
respectively, by 17α hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in 
increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.

Coating: titanium dioxide, macrogol 3350, talc, polyvinyl alcohol, iron oxide red (E172) and iron oxide black 
(E172).  
The product is available in PVdC-PE-PVC blister with an aluminium foil backing as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC.  
2.3.2.  Active  substance 
The active substance used in the 500 mg film-coated tablets is identical to the one used in the manufacture 
of  the  currently  authorised  250  mg  tablet.  No  new  information  on  the  active  substance  has  been  provided 
within this line extension application. 
2.3.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The quantitative composition of oval shaped, purple film-coated (FC) tablet is provided. 
The first commercialized formulation containing abiraterone acetate is the 250 mg uncoated tablet. The aim 
of this line extension is to introduce the 500 mg strength of abiraterone acetate film-coated tablets. The new 
strength  was  developed  in  order  to  reduce  the  pill  burden  and  improve  patient  comfort.  The  film-coat  was 
introduced in order to eliminate dust formation and to differentiate tablet strengths by colour. 
The  Pharmaceutical  development of  the  finished  product  contains  QbD elements.  The  quality  target  product 
profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release film coated tablet, for oral administration, containing 500 
mg of abiraterone acetate, bioequivalent to the commercial 250mg uncoated tablet, that meets microbial and 
impurity  standards.  The  film-coated  tablet  stability  should  be  at  least  24 months  and  the  container  closure 
system  should  be  blisters  or  bottles.  The  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  identified  were:  appearance, 
identification, assay, chromatographic purity, microbial purity, uniformity of dosage units, and dissolution. 
Abiraterone  acetate  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder  practically  insoluble  in  water.  Abiraterone  acetate  is 
classified  as  Class  IV  compound  (low  solubility,  low  permeability)  according  to  the  biopharmaceutical 
classification  system  (BCS).  Physico-chemical  characteristics  of  the  active  substance  that  can  affect  the 
intended  performance  of  the  dosage  form  are  solubility,  particle  size  distribution,  and  polymorphism.  These 
characteristics  are  controlled  by  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  and/or  specifications  and  their 
limits are considered justified. Analysis of finished product samples by means of XRD has demonstrated that 
the  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  does  not  lead  to  polymorphic  conversion  of  the  active 
substance. Additionally, no change of the solid state form of the active substance was observed for finished 
product samples stored for up to 24 months in the warehouse. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur. 
standards, with the exception of silicified microcrystalline cellulose which is tested according to NF standards 
and of the film-coating material Opadry II purple which is tested according to an in-house specification. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The 500mg film-coated tablet includes excipients not 
used  in  the  currently  marketed  250mg  tablet:  hypromellose,  silicified  microcrystalline  cellulose  and  coating 
powder  Opadry  Purple.  Therefore  compatibility  of  the  active  substance  was  studied  in  binary  mixtures  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/538739/2016 
Page 8/29 
  
  
these  excipients,  as  well  as  in  a  full  blend  mixture  containing  all ingredients  in  equal  proportions.  Selection 
and concentrations of the excipients are justified, and their function in the finished product described.  
A dissolution method has been developed for quality control (QC) during release and stability testing of the 
finished product. The dissolution test is performed in a paddle instrument (USP type 2) and it is adequately 
described and designed. The method used for the 500 mg film-coated tablets is similar to the dissolution test 
for 250 mg tablets except for the rotation speed and filter used. The discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method  was  investigated  with  regards  to  changes  in  particle  size,  granulation  process  parameters,  tablet 
hardness,  and  finished  product  stability  changes.  Differences  in  dissolution  profiles  are  observed  when 
different  active  substance  particle  size  distributions  or  granulation  parameters  are  used.    However  because 
the  studied  ranges  were  very  close  to  the  target  values,  some  OOS-batches  for  particle  size  or  granulation 
process parameters fulfilled the dissolution specifications. Changes in coating weight gain were not detected 
by  the  method.  Nevertheless  taking  into  account  the  type  of  product,  the  discriminatory  power  of  the 
dissolution method is considered acceptable.  
Two different 500 mg FC tablets have been developed initially. One was manufactured in a dose proportional 
way to the commercial 250 mg uncoated tablet using high-shear granulation, and was subsequently coated 
with  a  purple  film-coat.  Another  one  was  manufactured  using  fluid-bed  granulation.  The  excipient 
composition  of  the  tablet  manufactured  by  fluid-bed  granulation  was  therefore  adjusted  to  meet  the 
manufacturability  requirements  of  the  new  process,  to  reduce  the  tablet  weight,  and  to  meet  the  desired 
quality  profile  for  dissolution  and  bioavailability.  The  second  500  mg  FC  tablet  was  given  the  same  purple 
film-coat as the first formulation. In a relative bioavailability trial, the two new tablet formulations of 500 mg 
dosage  strength  were  compared  to  the  commercial  250  mg  uncoated  tablet.  Based  on  the  results  the 
bioavailability  study,  the  tablet  using  fluid-bed  granulation  was  selected  to  be  tested  in  a  pivotal 
bioequivalence  trial.  Bioequivalence  study  was  performed  showing  bioequivalence  between  the  commercial 
250 mg uncoated tablet and the proposed commercial formulation for the 500 mg film-coated tablet.  
The finished product manufacturing process was systematically evaluated through the use of risk assessment 
to identify critical process parameters (CPPs). The risk identification was based on process development and 
manufacturing  data  from  the  product  or  on  prior  knowledge.  The  experimental  studies  performed  to 
determine the criticality of process parameters, and to establish appropriate target settings and ranges, have 
been  performed  at  both  production  scale  sizes  proposed.  The  critical  process  parameters  have  been 
adequately identified for the following steps: fluid bed granulation and drying, initial blending, final blending, 
compression, film-coating. Based on the outcome of this evaluation a risk-based control strategy is proposed. 
No design space has been proposed. 
The  primary  packaging  is PVdC/PE/PVC-alu  blister.  The  material  complies  with  EC  requirements.  The  choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  four  main  steps:  fluid  bed  granulation,  blending,  compression,  and 
film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Critical  steps  have  been  identified  as  being  fluid  bed  granulation  and  drying,  initial  blending,  final  blending 
(lubrication),  compression  and  film-coating.  They  are  properly  evaluated  at  the  commercial  scale.  The  in-
process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and  pharmaceutical  form.  Two 
production  scale  sizes  are  proposed.  Proven  acceptable  ranges  (PAR)  have  been  defined  for  the  following 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/538739/2016 
Page 9/29 
  
  
steps of the medicinal product: granulation, blending and film coating. The available development data, the 
proposed  control  strategy and  batch  analysis  data  from  both  sizes of  production  scale  batches  fully  support 
the proposed PARs. 
Formal validation will be performed post-approval on the first three consecutive commercial batches, prior to 
launching the product. An acceptable validation protocol has been provided.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual), identification (FTIR), assay and purity (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution test 
(HPLC), and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).  
Finished  product  specifications  are  considered  appropriate.  They  include  parameters  critical  to  finished 
product quality.  
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3B  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the  ICH  guidelines.  Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  seven  batches.  Three  of  them  have  been 
manufactured  at  the  proposed  manufacturing  site  at  the  small  production  scale  size  using  active  substance 
manufactured  by  the  two  approved  manufacturers.  Results  confirmed  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  were  provided  for  three  small  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long 
term  conditions  for  18  months  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  30  ºC  /  75%  RH,  for  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  and  for  12  months at  5  ºC  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines.  In  addition,  the 
three batches were exposed for three months at 50 ºC and one batch was exposed to light as defined in the 
ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.   
The  batches  of  medicinal product  were  identical  to those  proposed  for  marketing,  were  manufactured  using 
both  approved  sources  of  the  active  substance  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  chromatographic  purity,  dissolution,  microbial  purity. 
Specifications  are  the  same  as  the  release  specifications  except  for  assay  and  chromatographic  purity.  In 
addition water content is monitored during stability testing. Analytical methods are the same as described for 
release testing, have been correctly validated and are stability-indicating.  
No significant change was observed during storage of the finished product at the different storage conditions. 
Photostability study results demonstrated that the finished product is not light sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 with no special storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the 
finished product manufacturing process. However, no design space was claimed. The results of tests carried 
out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
None. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
No new nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data have been submitted in this 
application. 
2.4.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) of abiraterone was prepared in accordance with CHMP Guideline on 
the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1; 
EMA,  2006).  This  environmental  risk  was  assessed  as  part  of  the  initial  MA  application  for  Zytiga  250  mg 
tablets. 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  environmental  risk  assessment  to  support  this  application  (new  strength  and 
pharmaceutical form) for abiraterone acetate in Zytiga 500 mg film-coated tablets that can be summarised as 
follows:

Study 
Substances  are  considered  a  PBT-substance  when  they  fulfill  the  criteria  for  all  three  properties,  i.e., 
persistence,  bioaccumulation,  and  toxicity.  Abiraterone  acetate  fulfills  only  the  toxicity  criterion  and  is 
therefore not considered a PBT-substance. 
Calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) 
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  in  surface  water  (PEC SURFACEWATER)  has  been  calculated  following 
the formula required by the current CHMP guidance document as follows. 
The values for these parameters were  
DOSEai:  
Fpen:    
WASTEWinhab:  
DILUTION:  
= 1000 mg/day 
= 0.01 (=1% default) 
= 200 L (default) 
= 10 (default) 
Therefore, PEC SURFACEWATER of abiraterone acetate in surface water is 5 µg/L. 
As the initial PECSURFACEWATER value is above 0.01µg/L, a Phase II environmental fate and effects was 
performed, according to guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.

On other hand, the applicant has performed a refinement of PEC SURFACEWATER based on metabolism data, waste 
water  treatment  plant  removal  (WWTP)  data  and  estimation  for  the  market  penetration  of  the  medicinal 
product in the EU. Thus, the refined PECSURFACEWATER is 0.0046 µg/L.

Also, the MAH has calculated a PNEC SEDIMENT whose value is 10 mg/kg, according the following formula:  
-  Groundwater assessment 
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  of  abiraterone  acetate  in  groundwater  (PECgroundwater)  was 
calculated using the following formula: 
PECgroundwater = 0.25 × PECsurfacewater 
Thus the PECGROUNDWATER for abiraterone acetate is 0.0012 μg/L 
-  Outcome of Tier A fate and effects analysis 
- 
PECSURFACEWATER:PNECWATER  
PECGROUNDWATER:PNECGROUNDWATER 
PECSURFACEWATER:PNECMICROORGANISM 
The  ratio  PECsurfacewater/PNECwater  is  above 
1,  no  further  testing  in  the  aquatic  conpartmen 
are needed 
The ratio PECgroundwater/PNECgroundwater is 
below 1. Consequently, further evaluation on the 
fate of abiraterone acetate and/or its 
metabolites in the aquatic environment is not 
needed. 
The ratio PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganisms 
is below 0.1. Consequently, further 
evaluation of the fate and effects of abiraterone 
acetate on microorganisms is 
not required. 
On other hand, the low bioconcentration values (BCF) of 625 and 576 indicate that abiraterone acetate does 
not bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. 
The adsorption/desorption coefficient (Koc) for activated sludge and soils indicates that abiraterone acetate is 
immobile  and  will  remain  preferably  in  soil.  Consequently,  an  environmental  assessment  of  abiraterone 
acetate in the terrestrial compartment was conducted. 
Tier B: Extended environmental fate and effects analysis  
To  estimate  the  terrestrial  environmental  concentrations  and  risk  assessment,  the  MAH  has  calculated  the 
PECSLUDGE. For abiraterone acetate, PECsludge was calculated as: 
Type (i) STP = 0.36 mg/kg dry sludge (combined sludge, i.e., primary + surplus sludge); 
Assessment report

Type (ii) STP = 0.28 mg/kg dry sludge (surplus sludge). 
The PECsoil of abiraterone acetate just after the first year of sludge application is given by: 
Where: 
CSLUDGE = 
Concentration  of  abiraterone  acetate  in  dry  sludge  (mg/kg);    conservative 
value from SimpleTreat 3.1 
APPL SLUDGE= 
Dry  sludge  application  rate  (kg/m2/year);default  value  of  TGD  =  0.5 
kg/m2/year 
DEPTHSOIL = 
Mixing depth in soil (m); default value of TGD = 0.20 m 
Thus, PECSOIL of abiraterone acetate in soil after the first sludge application is 5.3 x 10-4 mg/kg. 
The PNECsoil is based on the lowest NOEC result from the long-term toxicity tests, i.e., 100 mg/kg dry soil 
for terrestrial plants, i.e., 
Then, PECSOIL/PNECSOIL = 5.3 X 10-5 
As, the ratio PECSOIL/PNEC SOIL is below 1, further testing in the terrestrial compartment is not required.

2.4.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  nonclinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data  have  been  submitted  in  this 
application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted to support the line extension application dossier 
for Zytiga 500mg film-coated tablets. Formerly, the MAH submitted an ERA that was assessed as part of the 
initial  MA  application  for  Zytiga  250  mg  tablets.  Moreover,  on  28th  September  2012,  as  part  of  the 
application  number  II/00047G,  an  extended  partial  life  cycle  study  with  fathead  minnow  (Pimephales 
promelas)  to  assess  the  specific  mode  of  action  of  abiraterone  acetate  according  to  the  OECD 
recommendations for endocrine disrupting substances was submitted. And, with this study, a further updated 
ERA  report  in  which  the  toxicity  NOEC  and  PECSURFACEWATER  were  refined.  In  this  way,  since  this 
application  is  intended  to  obtain  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  a  new  film-coated  tablet  formulation  to  be 
used in the same currently approved indications of the marketed formulation of Zytiga, the submission of a 
new ERA was  not necessary. It is not expected an increase of potential risk of the medicinal product to the 
environment. 
Regarding the ERA submitted in the current application, the CHMP noted the following: 
• 
• 
The  MAH  has  refined  the  PECsurfacewater  with  metabolism  data,  waste  water  treatment  depletion 
data,  and  estimation  for  the  market  penetration  of  the  medicinal  product  in  the  EU.  This  is  not 
correct.  According  to  EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  guideline,  market  research  data  cannot  be  used 
for the refinement of the fraction of market penetration (Fpen). The refinement of the Fpen is based 
on prevalence of the disease and treatment regime. 
The  MAH  has  calculated  the  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  in  sediment  (PECsediment) 
according  to  the  EMEA  guideline  on  environmental  impact  assessment  for  veterinary  medicinal 
products  (EMEA/CVMP/ERA/418282/2005-Rev1).  This  is  not  correct,  since  the  evaluation  of 
environmental  risk  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  must  be  based  in  the  guidelines 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 and EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010.

2.4.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of abiraterone acetate.   
However, as it is mentioned in section 5.3 of Summary of Product Characteristics, it is known that the active 
substance abiraterone shows an environmental risk for the aquatic environment, especially to fish. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
This submission is intended to obtain the Marketing Authorisation for a new film-coated (FC) tablet 
formulation of Zytiga 500mg tablets to be used in the same currently approved indications of the marketed 
formulation of Zytiga. 
Several formulation have been developed to improve the commercial formulation (minor changes in 
excipients were made, allowing for the design of a 500 mg tablet) which would reduce the tablet burden and 
potentially represent more convenient dosing for patients. Furthermore, coating the tablet would reduce the 
risk of unwanted exposure during handling. 
A pivotal bioequivalence study 212082PCR1007 and the supportive relative bioavailability study (code 
212083PCR1010) are being submitted in the current dossier. These studies compared the oral bioavailability 
of the 250 mg and 500 mg FC tablets with the commercial 250 mg uncoated tablets of abiraterone acetate.  
In addition, for completeness, a Clinical Study Report (CSR) for study 212082PCR1006 (exploratory relative 
bioavailability study of 3 test FC tablets) was also submitted. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Pharmacokinetic analysis includes all subjects who have at least 1 non compartmental PK parameter 
estimated. Conventional and standard statistical methods have been employed.  
Relative Bioavailability 
Clinical Study Report 212082PCR1006 
This study was a randomized, open-label, single-center, 4-way crossover study of a single dose of 1,000 mg 
abiraterone acetate under fasted conditions in healthy male subjects with a wash-out period of 7 days to 
assess the relative bioavailability of 3 new abiraterone acetate tablet formulations with respect to the current 
commercial abiraterone acetate tablet under fasted conditions in healthy male subjects. 
The main difference between formulations was the SLS content, which is lower in the new formulation (range 
of 0.5% to 2%) compared to the current formulation. 
The results showed that the systemic exposure (assessed by the mean Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-∞) to 
abiraterone was lower for all three coated tablets relative to the commercial uncoated tablet. The rate of 
absorption was lower in the test formulations approximately 33% to 43% and the extent of absorption 
approximately by 20% to 30% lower compared to the test formulation. 
These observed differences could be associated with the differences in the content of SLS according to the 
Applicant. Interestingly, although treatment D exhibits a slower dissolution rate, in vivo it exhibits the higher 
Cmax. Therefore, the in vitro dissolution testing lacks of any predictive value. 
Clinical Study Report 212082PCR1010 
This was a single-dose, open-label, randomized, 4-period, 5-treatment crossover study to assess the relative 
bioavailability of 4 new abiraterone acetate tablet formulations with respect to the current commercial 
abiraterone acetate tablet under fasted conditions in healthy male subjects. An incomplete block design was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/538739/2016 
Page 19/29 
  
  
 
 
used in this study to reduce the number of treatment periods while keeping equal precision among all 4 
paired comparisons between the test treatment groups vs. the reference. 
Overall, mean systemic exposures to abiraterone, as assessed by Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-∞, after 
administration of abiraterone acetate in test formulations were comparable to the mean systemic exposure to 
abiraterone following the administration of the reference formulation. 
Treatments B and C showed the least difference in mean systemic exposures to abiraterone compared with 
Treatment A, with GMRs ranging from 99.07 to 101.23 for Treatment B and 101.94 to 103.67 for Treatment 
C, and the 90% CIs of GMR for AUCs falls completely within 80% to 125%. 
Treatments D and E appeared to be lower in mean systemic exposures to abiraterone compared with 
Treatment A, with GMRs ranging from 94.52 to 96.09 for Treatment D and 90.66 to 91.68 for Treatment E, 
with lower bound of 90% CI falling below 80%. 
Based on the PK results of this study, it is said that treatment B and C are selected for the pivotal study and 
at the same time it is said that the coated version of the current 250 mg formulation was tested in the pivotal 
study. 
It was confirmed that Treatment D (G004, 250 mg coated tablet with current composition) and Treatment C 
(G023, 500 mg coated tablet with new composition) from Study 212082PCR1010 were used to establish 
bioequivalence in the pivotal Study 212082PCR1007. 
Different treatment designations were used in the different studies. The formulations designated as 
Treatment D and C from Study 212082PCR1010 are referred to as Treatment B and C in Study 
212082PCR1007. 
Bioequivalence 
Clinical Study Report 212082PCR1007 
This was a single-dose, open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover pivotal study (Williams design) to assess 
the bioequivalence of 2 abiraterone acetate coated tablet formulations with respect to the current commercial 
abiraterone acetate uncoated tablet formulation under fasted conditions in healthy male subjects.  
Maximum plasma concentrations of abiraterone were reached relatively rapidly with median tmax occurring 2 
hours after drug administration across the 3 formulations. The apparent elimination phase profiles were also 
similar across the 3 formulations, with plasma concentrations declining in a biphasic manner and mean 
apparent terminal half-lives (t1/2, term) ranging from 16.3 to 16.6 hours across the 3 formulations (see the 
figures and table below).

Table 4 - Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic data of abiraterone following single oral dose administration 
of abiraterone acetate to healthy fasting subjects 
The 90% CI geometric mean ratios of abiraterone Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-∞ were within the 80% to 125% 
range, indicating that the two test formulations (Treatments B and C) were bioequivalent with respect to the 
reference  formulation  (Treatment  A).  However,  the  confidence  level  should  have  been  corrected  for 
multiplicity. The 93.93% CI have been calculated by the CHMP and the results are presented below: 
Cmax: 
Treatment B 
83.90 - 103.00 
Treatment C 
92.75 - 113.88 
AUClast: Treatment B 
83.56 – 98.40 
Treatment C 
98.87 – 109.35 
AUC∞:   
Treatment B 
83.78 – 98.54 
Treatment C 
92.63 -108.96 
Therefore, bioequivalence has been shown also after correction of the confidence level for multiplicity. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Non applicable. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic software and methods used for AUC0-t and Cmax estimation were considered 
acceptable. The non-compartmental linear-trapezoidal calculation was adequate. Pharmacokinetics variables 
are appropriate for a single dose bioequivalence study of an immediate release product. 
The validation of the analytical method is apparently satisfactory for some validation parameters according to 
the data submitted. The Applicant has submitted the method validation report BA10183 as well as two 
amendments to the analytical method. The pre-study validation of the analytical method is satisfactory. The 
Assessment report

method met the acceptance criteria for all the validation parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable 
performance. 
A pivotal bioequivalence study 212082PCR1007 and the supportive relative bioavailability study (code 
212083PCR1010) are being submitted in the current dossier. These studies compared the oral bioavailability 
of the 250 mg and 500 mg FC tablets with the commercial 250 mg uncoated tablets of abiraterone acetate. 
In addition, for completeness, a Clinical Study Report (CSR) for study 212082PCR1006 (exploratory relative 
bioavailability study of 3 test FC tablets) was also included.  
The design of the relative bioavailability exploratory study of three new formulations compared to the current 
formulation is considered acceptable.  
During the assessment the Applicant was requested to submit the dissolution profiles of formulation G011, 
G012 and G013 (for study PCR1006) in the proposed QC dissolution methods for the 250 mg and the 500 mg 
strength in order to assess if the proposed dissolution method is able to discriminate between formulations 
with different bioavailability. 
The  Applicant  has  acknowledged  that  the  in  vitro  dissolution  test  employed  as  QC  method  is  not  able  to 
discriminate  between  bioequivalent  and  non-bioequivalent  formulations.  The  main  reason  is  the  use  of  a 
significant amount of surfactant to achieve “sink conditions”. In contrast, a more complex in vitro dissolution 
test, which tries to mimic the physiological conditions, is able to discriminate between bioequivalent and non-
bioequivalent formulations. Therefore, it is important to highlight that variations of this product should not be 
approved  based  on  the  in  vitro  dissolution  test  QC  method.  In  vivo  bioequivalence  studies  are  essential  to 
ensure  bioequivalence.  If  the  physiologically  based  dissolution  test  exhibits  poor  reproducibility  and 
incomplete dissolution as to be used as QC method, it should not be used to approve any variation. 
The  Applicant  claims  that  the  QC  method  is  suitable  for  release  and  stability  testing  because  of  their 
discriminative  power.  It  is  claimed  to  be  discriminative  towards  particle  size  and  tablet  hardness.  If  there 
were  any  other  accidental  modification  in  the  manufacturing  it  is  unknown  if  it  would  be  detected  with  the 
current  QC  method.  The  Applicant  claims  that  it  is  slightly  discriminative  towards  the  tested  granulation 
process  parameter  ranges  and  it  is  able  to  pick  up  potential  trends  during  the  stability  testing  of  the  drug 
product. In any case, it is unknown if these changes in the particle size, hardness, granulation parameters or 
stability are affecting bioavailability. So it is unknown the value of these predictions. It may be possible that 
those in vitro differences have no impact on bioavailability and that other undetected in changes may change 
bioavailability of the drug product, like between the different tested formulations. However, this is accepted 
currently as QC tool. 
The “sink conditions” are considered essential in QC methods (as pointed out in the “Reflection paper on the 
dissolution specifications for generic oral immediate release products”). Consequently, the QC method cannot 
be useful from an in vivo predictive point of view. Its limited value is acknowledged and this issue should not 
be pursued any further. 
The bioavailability study (212082PCR1010) demonstrated comparable bioavailability between the current 
commercial uncoated tablet and 4 new FC tablet formulations. Based on the PK results of this study, it is said 
that treatment B and C are selected for the pivotal study (212082PCR1007) and at the same time it is said 
that the coated version of the current 250 mg formulation was tested in the pivotal study. 
The Applicant confirmed that Treatment D (G004, 250 mg coated tablet with current composition) and 
Treatment C (G023, 500 mg coated tablet with new composition) from Study 212082PCR1010 were used to 
establish bioequivalence in the pivotal Study 212082PCR1007.

Different treatment designations were used in the different studies. The formulations designated as 
Treatment D and C from Study 212082PCR1010 are referred to as Treatment B and C in Study 
212082PCR1007. 
This pivotal bioequivalence study confirmed that the proposed to-be-marketed 250 mg and 500 mg FC 
tablets were bioequivalent to the current commercial 250 mg uncoated tablet of abiraterone acetate.  
Although these studies are usually conducted at the highest strength (i.e., 2 x 250mg tablets and 1 x 500 mg 
tablets), the Applicant has conducted the studies at the therapeutic dose of 1000 mg (i.e., 4 x 250 mg and 2 
x  500  mg),  this  is  considered  acceptable  since  abiraterone  does  not  exhibit  less  than  proportional 
pharmacokinetics  when  increasing  the  dose.  The  administration  of  several  tablets  simultaneously  can 
increase variability due to different gastric emptying times of each unit, but it may represent the worst case 
scenario for a low solubility drug compared to the highest strength. 
It was discussed, during the assessment, if the new 500mg formulation could give an altered food effect. 
CHMP agreed that the food effect of abiraterone is mainly drug dependent. However, it may also be product 
dependent. The applicant’s claim that hypromellose and povidone have the same negligible food effect is 
speculative. Similarly the absence of information on the relationship between SLS and food effect is not 
demonstrative of absence of a food effect caused by SLS in the case of abiraterone. Furthermore, it is the 
whole formulation and not the isolated excipients that can alter the food effect on the drug bioavailability. 
Therefore, the Applicant justification was considered speculative and it is not able to ensure that the food 
effect will be similar in both strengths / formulations. However, as the new proposed strength of 500 mg is 
taken only in fasted state as the existing 250 mg strength, it is irrelevant if the food effect is different or not 
because the product should not be taken with meals. This issue would be relevant if a new formulation could 
be able to remove the food effect so that the new formulation can be taken with or without meals, but it is 
extremely unlikely and it is not the intention of the Applicant to modify the instructions of use. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the biopharmaceutical studies submitted, the proposed 500 mg abiraterone acetate film-coated 
tablet formulation was bioequivalent to the current commercial 250 mg uncoated tablet when administered at 
the therapeutic dose of 1000 mg, since the 90% and 93.93% confidence intervals for the geometric mean 
ratios of abiraterone Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-∞ were within the 80% to 125% range 
The Clinical programme to obtain the Marketing Authorisation for a new film-coated (FC) tablet formulation of 
Zytiga 500 mg tablets is considered acceptable.

Study PCR1010 
Thirty  two  healthy  adult  males  were  randomized  into  the  study;  30  subjects  completed  the  study,  and  2 
subjects terminated early. All of the 32 randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of abiraterone acetate 
and were included in the safety analysis.

An  overview  of  TEAEs  is  presented  in  Table  5.  All  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  No  deaths  or 
serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. One subject terminated the study early due to an investigator-
reported adverse event (AE) of Grade 1 hypertriglyceridemia on Study Day 15 after completion of Period 2. 
The  event  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  the  study  medication.  The  most 
common  TEAEs  observed  were  flatulence,  nausea,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  back  pain,  myalgia, 
headache, ocular hyperemia, and ecchymosis (each in 2 subjects [6.3%]). 
A larger percentage of subjects from Treatment Group C (34.8%) were reported with TEAEs. The TEAEs were 
not  all  systematically  in  one  System  Organ  Class  (SOC),  but  rather,  were  spread  across  several  SOCs.  All 
were Grade 1 in severity, and no specific TEAE occurred in more than 1 subject.

2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of abiraterone is characterised by peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension and 
urinary tract infection, as the most common adverse reactions. Other important adverse reactions include 
cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic alveolitis. 
The two clinical studies submitted in this variation are limited to two single dose clinical trials. The design of 
these ones is not definitely the best way to judge any new safety signal. In fact, bioequivalence studies do 
not usually offer any kind of safety discussions. With this premise in mind, it is not surprising that no new 
safety concerns have been identified with the new formulation, which is expectable given the aim of the 
variation and the results from that. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety conclusions about this new formulation do not change the previous safety analysis for the already 
authorized formulation of 250 mg. The safety profile continues to be acceptable. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  12.0  (dated  15  September  2015)  could  be  acceptable  if  the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The current commercial formulation of abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) is presented as 250 mg uncoated tablets.  
This submission is intended to obtain the Marketing Authorisation for a new film-coated (FC) tablet 
formulation of Zytiga 500 mg tablets to be used in the same currently approved indications of the marketed 
formulation of Zytiga.  
The use of the new tablet strength and formulation is supported by the results of two Phase I studies. Study 
212082PCR1010 demonstrated comparable relative bioavailability of 2 new 500 mg FC tablet concepts 
compared to commercially available Zytiga (250 mg uncoated tablets). Study 212082PCR1007 demonstrated 
bioequivalence between the 500 mg FC tablets with respect to the current commercial 250 mg uncoated 
tablets of abiraterone acetate.  
Based on the biopharmaceutical studies submitted, the proposed 500 mg abiraterone acetate film-coated 
tablet formulation was bioequivalent to the current commercial 250 mg uncoated tablet when administered at 
the therapeutic dose of 1000 mg, since the 90% and 93.93% confidence intervals for the geometric mean 
ratios of abiraterone Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-∞ were within the 80% to 125% range. 
As expected, no new safety concerns have been identified in the two clinical studies submitted. 
The benefit risk balance remains positive 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zytiga is positive 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the risk-benefit 
balance of Zytiga with prednisone or prednisolone in the following indications:

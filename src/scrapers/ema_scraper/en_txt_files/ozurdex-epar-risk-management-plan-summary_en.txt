Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  for  OZURDEX  (dexamethasone  intravitreal 
implant in applicator) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  for  OZURDEX.  The  RMP  details 
important  risks  of  OZURDEX,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information 
will be obtained about OZURDEX risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
OZURDEX's  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  OZURDEX  should  be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for OZURDEX should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, which are part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
OZURDEX's RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
OZURDEX is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: 
- 
- 
-  
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) who are pseudophakic or who 
are considered insufficiently responsive to, or unsuitable for, non-corticosteroid therapy  
macular  oedema  following  either  Branch  Retinal  Vein  Occlusion  (BRVO)  or  Central 
Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)  
inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis. 
It contains dexamethasone as the active substance and it is given by intravitreal injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of OZURDEX ’s benefits can be found in OZURDEX’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ozurdex. 
II.
Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further
characterise the risks
Important risks of OZURDEX, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about OZURDEX's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
(cid:127)   Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals
(cid:127)  
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
(cid:127)   The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly
(cid:127)   The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with
or without a prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of OZURDEX, these measures are supplemented with additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
is  regularly  analysed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment  so  that 
immediate  action  can  be 
taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  OZURDEX  is  not  yet  available,  it  is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A
List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  OZURDEX  are  risks  that  need special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  OZURDEX.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important Identified Risk: Increased intraocular pressure, Glaucoma, Ocular hypertension 
Clinical trials data, and literature 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups  A review of published literature on the intravitreal use of the corticosteroid 
triamcinolone revealed that steroid-induced elevation of IOP (SIOP) is a well-known 
side effect of intravitreal steroids (van Kooij et al. 2006). Dexamethasone, a 
synthetic glucocorticoid, would therefore be expected to elicit a similar response. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8  
PL section 2 and 4. 
Pack size: single-use intravitreal implant in applicator 
Legal status: restricted medical prescription 
Additional risk minimisation measures:  
- Patient guide 
- Patient audio CD (where required) 
Important Identified Risk: Endophthalmitis 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups  Endophthalmitis is a serious complication following cataract surgery and intravitreal 
Clinical trials data, Global Safety Database, and literature 
injection and diabetes has been suggested as a risk factor (Montan et al. 1998, 
Fahmy1975, Skarbez et al. 2010). Endogenous endophthalmitic among diabetics is 
caused by bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, and 
Staphylococcus (Skarbez et al. 2010, Phillips et al. 1994). It has been suggested that 
patients’ external tissues are the source of the infecting organism in acute 
postoperative endophthalmitis cases (Speaker et al. 1991). Identified possible risk 
factors for infectious endophthalmitis in intravitreal injection of another 
corticosteroid, triamcinolone, include diabetes mellitus, multi-use bottles, poor 
sterile techniques, filtering blebs (decreased ocular barrier function), and blepharitis 
(Moshfeghi et al. 2003). 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8  
PL section 2, 3 and 4. 
Pack size: single-use intravitreal implant in applicator 
Legal status: restricted medical prescription 
Additional risk minimisation measures:  
- Patient guide 
- Patient audio CD (where required) 
Important Identified Risk: Device dislocation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups  All patients with posterior capsule tear, such as those with a posterior lens (e.g., due 
Global Safety Database 
to cataract surgery), and/or those who have an iris opening to the vitreous cavity 
(e.g., due to iridectomy) with or without a history of vitrectomy, are at risk of 
implant migration into the anterior chamber. Implant migration to the anterior 
chamber may lead to corneal oedema. Persistent severe corneal oedema could 
progress to the need for corneal transplantation. Other than those patients 
contraindicated (see SmPC section 4.3), OZURDEX should be used with caution and 
only following a careful risk benefit assessment. These patients should be closely 
monitored to allow for early diagnosis and management of device migration.

Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical trials data, Global Safety Database, and literature 
Immunosuppression/Immunodeficiency; other factors unknown. Literature report of 
CMV retinitis following intravitreal triamcinolone treatment in 2 otherwise-
immunocompetent patients with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, pseudophakia, 
and vitrectomy (Delyfer et al., 2007). 
The risk of reactivation of latent ophthalmic infections increases with 
immunosuppressive therapy and immunodeficiency. In addition, the risk of 
reactivation of infection has been observed to be highest immediately after the 
immune recovery seen with initiation or re-initiation of highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART). (Holland, 2008)
